50|$|With magnetically {{actuated}} float sensors, switching {{occurs when}} a permanent magnet sealed inside a float rises or falls to the actuation level. With a mechanically actuated float, switching {{occurs as a result}} of the movement of a float against a miniature (micro) switch.

For example, larger floats may be used with liquids with specific gravities as low as 0.5 while still maintaining buoyancy.

40|$|Abstract: Tide gates are {{frequently}} placed at confluences of streams with tidal waters. These gates prevent tidal waters from inundating low-lying lands while allowing stream flows to drain during lower tidal stages. Traditional tide gates effectively preclude an estuarine environment upstream {{of the gate}} and often block native fish from entering these tributary streams. In recent years, {{a new generation of}} tide gates has been installed with the intent of improving fish passage and allowing a limited amount of tidal inflow into the stream to create a longitudinal transition from the marine to freshwater environment. This new generation of tide gate uses side-hinged doors that open wider to permit efficient outflow and produce slower water velocities to accommodate fish passage. These gates also allow a limited amount of tidal water to flow upstream. Inflow of tidal water is regulated to mute the peak tidal stage and preventing upstream tidal flooding. The muted tide is regulated by either: 1. a small adjustable opening that functions as an orifice and sized to prevent excessive tidal inflow, or 2. a <b>mechanical</b> <b>float</b> system that holds the gate open until the upstream stage reaches a predetermined threshold. Design of these muted tidal systems involves extensive hydraulic analysis to evaluate fish passage, prevent upstream tidal flooding, and create the desired estuarine conditions, including vegetation zonation. This presentation will illustrate the types of analysis and considerations employed with this new generation of tide gates. Two recently constructed tide gate replacements designed for passage of all life stages of Pacific anadromous salmonids will be used as case examples to highlight the design proces...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{analyze the}} risk factors for {{inflammatory}} macular edema (ME) {{in a series of}} patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery using Silicone Oil (SO) as a long-term tamponade. Materials and methods: We examined 118 consecutive eyes of 115 patients, mean age 57. 8 years (range 39 - 79), suffering from various types of severe retinal detachment. Surgical procedures were carried out on all patients, and SO 1000 cs was injected into the eye at the end of surgery to permit stable retinal reattachment. ME was classified as initial, medium and severe. The characteristics of ME were compared with various preoperative, intra-surgical and postoperative parameters. Statistical analyses were carried out using the T test and the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: Twenty-six eyes were excluded. Twenty out of 92 eyes (22 %) presented various types of ME. No significant correlation was found between ME and age or complication and duration of surgery. Significant correlation was found between ME and macular status before surgery and time length of intraocular permanence of SO. Conclusion: SO should be removed as soon as possible, in particular when the preoperative macular status is compromised.

50|$|Besides {{being an}} {{interesting}} means to visualise phenomena that {{are typical of}} the quantum <b>mechanical</b> world, <b>floating</b> droplets on a vibrating bath have interesting analogies with the pilot wave theory, {{also known as the}} De Broglie-Bohm theory, or the causal interpretation, one of the many interpretations of quantum mechanics in its early stages of conception and development. The theory was initially proposed by Louis de Broglie in 1927, and later developed by David Bohm. It suggests that all particles in motion are actually borne on a wave-like motion, similar to how an object moves on a tide. In this theory, it is the evolution of the carrier wave that is given by the Schrödinger equation. It is a deterministic theory and is entirely nonlocal. It {{is an example of a}} hidden variable theory, and all non-relativistic quantum mechanics can be accounted for in this theory. The theory was abandoned by de Broglie in 1932, and it gave way to the Copenhagen interpretation. The Copenhagen interpretation does not use the concept of the carrier wave or that a particle moves in definite paths until measurement is made. The Copenhagen Interpretation has stood the test of time as the widely accepted interpretation of Quantum Theory since then.|$|R
40|$|Wastewater lift {{stations}} are facilities designed to move wastewater from lower to higher elevation through pipes. Key elements of lift stations include a wastewater receiving well (wet-well), often {{equipped with a}} screen or grinding to remove coarse materials; pumps and piping with associated valves; motors; a power supply system; an equipment control and alarm system; and an odor control system and ventilation system. Lift station equipment and systems are often installed in an enclosed structure. They can be constructed on-site (custom-designed) or prefabricated. Lift station capacities range from 76 liters per minute (20 gallons per minute) to more than 378, 500 liters per minute (100, 000 gallons per minute). Pre-fabricated lift stations generally have capacities of up to 38, 000 liters per minute (10, 000 gallons per minute). Centrifugal pumps are commonly used in lift stations. A trapped air column, or bubbler system, that senses pressure and level is commonly used for pump station control.

40|$|The first local {{invasion}} of the alien subtropical aquatic Floating Pennywort (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides) in urban waterways during the hot summer of 1995 seemingly ended due {{to a combination of}} <b>mechanical</b> removal of <b>floating</b> and terrestrial plant material and a subsequent severe winter. Recently however the plant proved to be hardy to even severe frost when protected bij natural vegetation. As a result a large area of waterways in and around the city ’s-Hertogenbosch became covered with floating mats of plants which had to be removed at the expense of high costs. This however could not prevent the plant from escaping to the river Meuse, and probably from there to a former tidal nature reserve.

40|$|This thesis covers both {{experimental}} and computer {{investigations into the}} dynamic behaviour of mechanical seals. The literature survey shows no investigations {{on the effect of}} vibration on mechanical seals of the type common in the various process industries. Typical seal designs are discussed. A form of Reynolds' equation has been developed that permits the calculation of stiffnesses and damping coefficients for the fluid film. The dynamics of the <b>mechanical</b> seal <b>floating</b> ring have been investigated using approximate formulae, and {{it has been shown that}} the floating ring will behave as a rigid body. Some elements, such as the radial damping due to the fluid film, are small and may be neglected. The equations of motion of the floating ring have been developed utilising the significant elements, and a solution technique described. The stiffness and damping coefficients of nitrile rubber o-rings have been obtained. These show a wide variation, with a constant stiffness up to 60 Hz. The importance of the effect of temperature on the properties is discussed. An unsuccessful test rig is described in the appendices. The dynamic behaviour of a mechanical seal has been investigated experimentally, including the effect of changes of speed, sealed pressure and seal geometry. The results, as expected, show that high vibration levels result in both high leakage and seal temperatures. Computer programs have been developed to solve Reynolds' Equation and the equations of motion. Two solution techniques for this latter program were developed, the unsuccesful technique is described in the appendices. Some stability problems were encountered, but despite these the solution shows good agreement with some of the experimental conditions. Possible reasons for the discrepancies are discussed. Various suggestions for future work in this field are given. These include the combining of the programs and more extensive {{experimental and}} computer modelling...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Biochemical {{activities}} in sewer pipes generate various volatile substances {{that lead to}} several serious problems such as malodor complaints and lawsuits, concrete and metal corrosion, increased operational costs, and health risks. Frequent inspections are critical to maintain sewer health, yet are extremely expensive given {{the extent of the}} sewer system and the “unfriendliness ” of the environment. In this paper we propose SewerSnort, a low cost, unmanned, fully automated in-sewer gas monitoring system. A sensor float is introduced at the upstream station and drifts to the end pumping station, collecting location tagged gas measurements. The retrieved SewerSnort provides an accurate gas exposure profile to be used for preventive maintenance and/or repair. The key innovations of SewerSnort are the fully automated, end-to-end monitoring solution and the low energy self localizing strategy. From the implementation standpoint, the key enablers are the <b>float</b> <b>mechanical</b> design that fits the sewer constraints and the embedded sensor design that matches the float form factor and complies with the tight energy constraints.

30|$|In the <b>mechanical</b> part, the <b>float</b> {{moves up}} and down driven by waves, pulling pulley 2 and pulley 3 to rotate in {{opposite}} directions. During the wave falling period, only pulley 2, ratchet wheel 1 and driving pulley 4 work to drive the driving pulley 6. If the rotating speed of pulley 2 is {{equal to that of}} driving pulley 4 and the wave keeps falling, the connection between pulley 2 and driving pulley 4 is maintained by ratchet wheel 1. Similarly, during the wave rising period, only pulley 3, ratchet wheel 2 and driving pulley 5 work to drive the driving pulley 6. When pulley 3 keeps pace with driving pulley 5 through ratchet wheel 2 and the driving force is continually on pulley 3, the SRG rotating speed will increase. Through this process, the wave energy is captured and converted into mechanical energy. One thing to be noted is that two ratchet wheels ensure the rotor of SRG rotates in single direction during the whole process. The torque applied on the rotor is always negative, whether wave rises or falls. The work efficiency is greatly improved, compared with that of a single-direction driven float-type wave power system, which works only when the wave is rising, or only when it is falling.|$|R
40|$|Hydrological changes {{associated}} with irrigation, {{in conjunction with}} increased nutrient concentrations and aquatic plant densities, have greatly impacted fish habitat values on the Burdekin River floodplain. The two most significant weeds in the Burdekin floodplain are water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and para grass (Urochloa mutica). Water hyacinth creates a base for the para grass (and then other weeds) to grow out into deeper water, creating weed mats that can then only be removed by mechanical means or floods of the largest magnitude. We attempted to rehabilitate floodplain lagoons by the <b>mechanical</b> removal of <b>floating</b> weed mats and monitored the result by measuring the subsequent effects on fish habitats and fish communities. Prior to weed removal, fish habitats were generally of poor quality, and fish community structure was skewed away from rich native assemblages to depauperate communities dominated in some instances by alien species. Poor water quality arising from floating weed mats {{is considered to be}} the main determinant of reduced fish abundance and diversity. After mechanical weed removal, recovery of water quality and physical habitat led to the re-establishment of many native fish species. Key refuge habitats within the distribution channels were a critical source of recruits for fishes dispersing during times of elevated seasonal flows into the newly rehabilitated reaches. This study demonstrates that floating alien weed mats have significant negative effects upon aquatic communities and that mechanical removal of these weed mats (as opposed to chemical removal) results in dramatic improvements in native fish species richness and abundance.

Our experiments were focused on the application of nanorobot (red cells) to make them immune resistant against viruses and making them as useful contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging use based on their behavior in nanomagnetic fields. It consists of an injection of perhaps a few cubic centimeters of nano-sized nanorobots suspended in specific pH fluid (probably a water/saline suspension). The typical therapeutic concentration was up to 1 - 10 trillion (1 trillion = 10 raise to power 12) individual nanorobots, although in some cases treatment only require a few million or a few billion individual nanodevice-like red cells to be injected.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} in floating wind turbines in deep waters, however, {{there are also}} significant technological challenges associated with it too. The dynamic excitation of wind and waves can induce excessive motions along each of the {{6 degrees of freedom}} (6 -DOF) of the floating platforms. These motions will then be transferred to the turbine, and directly impact the wake characteristics of the floating wind turbines, and consequently the resultant wind loadings and performances of the wind turbines sited in offshore wind farms. In the present study, a comprehensive experimental study was performed to analyze the near wake characteristics of a wind turbine model subjected to surge, heave, and pitch motions. The experimental study was performed in a large-scale atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel with a scaled three-blade Horizontal Axial Wind Turbine model placed in a turbulent boundary layer airflow with similar mean and turbulence characteristics as those over a typical offshore wind farm. The base of a 1 : 300 scaled model wind turbine was mounted on a translation stage. The translation stage can be controlled to generate surge, pitch and heave motions to simulate the dynamic motions experienced by floating offshore wind turbines. During the experiments, the velocity scaling method was chosen to maintain the similar velocity ratios (i. e., the ratios of the incoming airflow flow to that of turbine base motion) between the model and the prototype. During the experiments, a high resolution digital particle image velocimetry (PIV) system was used to achieve flow field measurements to quantify the characteristics of the turbulent vortex flow in the near wake of the wind turbine model. Besides conducting "free run 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 PIV measurements to determine the ensemble-averaged statistics of the flow quantities such as mean velocity, Reynolds stress, and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) distributions in the wake flow, "phase-locked 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 PIV measurements were also performed to elucidate further details about evolution of the unsteady vortex structures in the wake flow in relation to the position of the rotating turbine blades. The effects of the surge, heave, and pitch motions of the wind turbine base on the wake flow characteristics were examined in great details based on the PIV measurements. The findings derived from the present study can be used to improve the understanding of the underlying physics for optimal <b>mechanical</b> design of <b>floating</b> offshore wind turbines, as well as the layout optimization of floating offshore wind farms. The results of the wake study reveal that the wake of a wind turbine subjected to base motions, is highly dependent on which direction the turbine is oscillating. Furthermore, the velocity, frequency, and the range of oscillation also play an important role on the behavior and the wake pattern of the moving turbine. In the case of the surge and pitch motions, the wake accelerates as the turbine is moving with the flow, hence, reducing the power extraction by the turbine. A decrease in Reynolds shear stress and the turbulent kinetic energy production was noted as the turbine was oscillating with the flow. However, as the turbine was moving into the flow, these effects reverse, and causes a deceleration {{in the wake of the}} moving turbine, hence increases the power production by the turbine, and increases the Reynolds shear stress and the turbulent kinetic energy. In the case of the heave motion, the wake tends to shift upward as the turbine was moving downward and vice versa. However, no significant difference in the Reynolds shear stress and the T. K. E. between the wake of the bottom fixed turbine and the oscillating turbine in heave motion was noted...|$|R
