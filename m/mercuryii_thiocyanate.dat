50|$|<b>Mercury(II)</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> (Hg(SCN)2) is an {{inorganic}} chemical compound, the coordination complex of Hg2+ and the thiocyanate anion. It {{is a white}} powder. It will produce a large, winding “snake” when ignited, an effect known as the Pharaoh's serpent.|$|E
50|$|Thiocyanate (also {{known as}} rhodanide) is the anion SCN−. It is the {{conjugate}} base of thiocyanic acid. Common derivatives include the colourless salts potassium thiocyanate and sodium thiocyanate. Organic compounds containing the functional group SCN are also called thiocyanates. <b>Mercury(II)</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> was formerly used in pyrotechnics.|$|E
40|$|Single {{crystals}} of K 2 Hg(SCN) 4 [dipotassium tetrathiocyanatomercurate(II) ] {{were grown}} from aqueous solutions of potassium thiocyanate and <b>mercury(II)</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> and studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In {{comparison with the}} previously reported structure model [Zvonkova (1952). Zh. Fiz. Khim. 26, 1798 – 1803], all atoms in the crystal structure were located, with lattice parameters and fractional coordinates determined to a much higher precision. In the (crystal) structure, the HgII atom is located on a twofold rotation axis and is coordinated {{in the form of}} a distorted tetrahedron by four S atoms of the thiocyanate anions. The K+ cation shows a coordination number of eight...|$|E

It is prepared by treating solutions containing <b>mercury(II)</b> and <b>thiocyanate</b> ions. The low solubility product of mercury thiocyanate causes it to precipitate from solution. Most syntheses are achieved by precipitation: ...|$|R
40|$|Two simple, rapid, and {{cost-effective}} methods based on titrimetric and spectrophotometric techniques are described for the assay of RNH in bulk drug and in dosage forms using silver nitrate, <b>mercury(II)</b> <b>thiocyanate,</b> and iron(III) nitrate as reagents. In titrimetry, an aq. soln. of RNH is treated with measured excess of silver nitrate in HNO 3 medium, followed by detn. of unreacted silver nitrate by Volhard method using iron(III) alum indicator. Spectrophotometric method involve the addn. a known excess of <b>mercury(II)</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> and iron(III) nitrate to RNH, {{followed by the}} {{measurement of the absorbance}} of iron(III) thiocyanate complex at 470 nm. Titrimetric method is applicable over 4 - 30 mg range and the reaction stoichiometry is found to be 1 : 1 (RNH: AgNO 3). In the spectrophotometric method, the absorbance is found to increase linearly with concn. of RNH which is corroborated by the correlation coeff. of 0. 9959. The system obey Beer's law for 5 - 70 Î¼g mL- 1. The calcd. apparent molar absorptivity and Sandell sensitivity values are found to be 3. 27 Ã— 103 L mol- 1 cm- 1, 0. 107 Î¼g cm- 2 resp. The limits of detection and quantification are also reported for the spectrophotometric method. Intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy of the methods were evaluated as per ICH guidelines. The methods were successfully applied to the assay of RNH in formulations and the results were compared with those of a ref. method by applying Student's t and F-tests. No interference was obsd. from common pharmaceutical excipients. The accuracy of the methods was further ascertained by performing recovery tests by std. addn. method. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|A flow {{injection}} spectrophotometric {{system is}} proposed for determining chloride in lead-acid battery electrolyte {{by using the}} displacement reaction between <b>mercury(II)</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> and chloride in a medium containing iron(III). The employment of a large sample volume was effective to avoid refractive index gradients in {{the central part of}} the sample zone. Sulfate interference was studied and the correlation between the chemical equilibria involved and the transient signals was used to develop a strategy for chloride quantification. Samples containing from 2. 2 to 3. 7 mol L- 1 of sulfuric acid can be determined by using the same analytical curve, without matrix interference or any previous treatment. The detection limit and the relative standard deviation were estimated in 0. 37 mg Cl- L- 1 (99. 7 % confidence level) and 1. 6 % (n = 10), respectively. The sampling rate was 45 h- 1. Recoveries between 95. 9 and 108 % were obtained for additions of chloride (2. 00 to 8. 00 mg L- 1) in the samples...|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} studies thiocyanate-containing metal {{complexes}} {{are considered to}} be the most investigated systems. Such complexes exhibit specific properties which could be applied in various fields such as catalysis, photochemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology and etc. The complexes of mercury(II) and iron(III) thiocyanates are of interest since they are widely applied for analysis in the clinical or industrial laboratories. As a result these complexes received great attention, due to the fascinating properties in designing new materials with inorganic and organic ligands. Dealing with such complex system, accurate prediction of the synthesized compound properties is challenging. For this reason, researchers analyze how the replacement of certain group, modification, molar ratio of the mixed ligands and etc. may influence the structure and properties of the obtained complex. Molecular structure, vibrational and electronic spectra of aqueous <b>mercury(II)</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> and iron(III) monoisothiocyanate solutions (at the pH ~ 2) were analyzed in the dissertation by means of Raman and UV-VIS spectroscopies and quantum chemical calculations. The structure, coordination number and vibrational assignments of the titled complexes were determined. The influence of different solvation models upon spectral properties was estimated. The excited state analysis of iron(III) monoisothiocyanate was performed...|$|E
