In this work an attempt is made to concurrently design Inter -Cell Layout and the MHS using a Genetic Algorithm based methodology for a Cellular Manufacturing System (CMS) environment under open field configuration. The proposed algorithm is employed to simultaneously optimize two contradicting objectives viz. 1. Total material handling cost (TMHC) 2. Total corner score (TCS). The algorithm is tested on four different bench <b>mark</b> <b>layouts</b> and with different initial problem data sets. It is found that the proposed algorithm is able to produce satisfactory solutions consistently within a reasonable computational limit...|$|R

5000|$|The {{simplest}} marked crossings {{may just}} consist of some markings {{on the road}} surface. In the US these are known as [...] "marked crosswalks." [...] In the UK these are often called zebra crossings, referring to the alternate white and black stripes painted on the road surface. If the pedestrian has priority over vehicular traffic when using the crossing, then they {{have an incentive to}} use the crossing instead of crossing the road at other places. In some countries, pedestrians may not have priority, but may be committing an offence if they cross the road elsewhere, or [...] "jaywalk." [...] Special markings are often made on the road surface, both to direct pedestrians and to prevent motorists from stopping vehicles in the way of foot traffic. There are many varieties of signal and <b>marking</b> <b>layouts</b> around the world and even within single countries. In the United States, there are many inconsistencies, although the variations are usually minor. There are several distinct types in the United Kingdom, each with their own name.|$|R

50|$|<b>Marking</b> blue, <b>layout</b> stain or Prussian blue is a dye used in {{metalworking}} {{to aid in}} marking out rough parts for further machining. It is sometimes called Dykem (after a popular brand). It is used to stain or paint a metal object with a very thin layer of dye that can be scratched off using a scriber or other sharp instrument to reveal a bright, yet very narrow line in the metal underneath. The advantages are that any existing scratches are covered with the dye and the new lines have a contrasting background.|$|R
50|$|<b>Marking</b> out or <b>layout</b> {{means the}} process of {{transferring}} a design or pattern to a workpiece, {{as the first step}} in the manufacturing process.

We propose an improved design for 3 D marking menus based on our findings. The experimental results also suggest that designers should consider carefully whether or not findings from similar interaction techniques using hands-on devices can be carried over to the design of freehand gestural interaction...|$|R
5000|$|A {{surface plate}} is a solid, flat plate {{used as the}} main {{horizontal}} reference plane for precision inspection, <b>marking</b> out (<b>layout),</b> and tooling setup. The surface plate is often used as the baseline for all measurements to a workpiece, therefore one primary surface is finished extremely flat with accuracy up to 0.00001 in for a grade AA or AAA plate. Surface plates are a very common tool in the manufacturing industry and are often permanently attached to robotic-type inspection devices such as a coordinate-measuring machine. Plates are typically square or rectangular. One current British Standard includes specifications for plates from 160 mm × 100 mm to 2500 mm × 1600 mm.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{straightforward}} short term policies to mitigate urban traffic congestion is control through traffic lights at a single junction or network level. Existing approaches for single junction Signal Setting Design (SSD) can be grouped into two classes: Stage-based or Phase-based methods. Both these approaches take the lane <b>marking</b> <b>layouts</b> as exogenous inputs, but lane-based optimisation method {{may be found in}} literature, even though for isolated signal-controlled junctions only. The Network Signal Setting Design (NSSD) requires that offsets are introduced; a traffic flow model is also needed to compute total delay. All existing methods for NSSD follow a stage-based approach; these methods do not allow for stage matrix optimisation: it is shown that explicit enumeration of stage sequences is only practicable for very small networks. This paper focuses on Network Signal Setting Design introducing the so-called scheduled synchronisation that includes green scheduling, green timing and coordination into one optimisation problem. The paper proposes a stage-based method to solve such a problem, {{as an extension of the}} synchronisation method and the traffic flow model proposed in Cantarella et al. (2015) : first a set of candidate stages is defined for each junction, then the stage sequences, the stage lengths and the offsets are optimised all together. To the authors’ knowledge, no other one-step optimisation method is available in literature for scheduled synchronisation. Results of the proposed method to a small network were compared with those from explicit enumeration of all stage sequences; results for a larger network are also discussed...|$|R

These marks are typically scratched on the timber with an awl-like tool until later in the 19th century, when they started using pencils.|$|R
40|$|Reciprocal roofs have, due {{to their}} unique {{appearance}} and possibility for large spans {{without the need for}} central support, gained popularity over the last 30 years. A variety of construction methods have been presented, with a varying degree of accuracy, and those that hold higher standards (i. e. those that take all the parameters into consideration and leave nothing to chance) exclusively deals with square-cut timber. In working with roundwood timber one has to adapt the <b>marking</b> and <b>layout</b> procedures to another set of prerequisites than those used in working with conventional square-cut timber. This study aims {{to bridge the gap between}} available published knowledge about the geometry in reciprocal roofs and the working methods applied in roundwood timber framing. The practical experiment accounted for is the full-scale construction of a hexagonal reciprocal roof with roundwood timber executed in sections and an investigation of the different problems posed by this method of construction.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{influence}} of connectives (because, so) and layout (continuous placement of sentences versus each sentence beginning on a new line) on the quality of students’ mental representations. By using multiple comprehension tasks, we found that cohesive text features have different effects on each facet of deeper text comprehension. On local comprehension tasks (i. e. bridging inference questions), all students performed better after reading history texts containing connectives than after reading texts without these markers. On global comprehension tasks (i. e. sorting tasks), pre-vocational students performed better when coherence relations were <b>marked,</b> regardless of <b>layout,</b> while pre-un iversity students did not need connectives as long as texts were presented in a natural, continuous way. These findings indicate that connectives are an important factor in creating comprehensible texts, in particular for pre-vocational students. Finally, we conclude there is a mismatch between these findings and the current practice in designing optimal educational texts, at least in the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} a {{translation}} of the dutch document "auto's te water". This report from the Netherlands concerns investigations of cars that crash into water. The investigation was conducted in two sections, descriptive and experimental research. In the latter, investigation is made of the individual effect {{of a large number}} of variables on the behavior of vehicles which have crashed into water and of the possibilities of escape for the occupants. The results show that more cars crash into water in winter than summer; The deaths/accidents ratio is higher at night; Many occupants are already injured, unconscious or have been thrown from car before impact; Most vehicles return to an approximate horizontal floating position after the initial plunge; almost all vehicles than sink into a vertical position, according to where the engine is located; shattering the windshield; and once submerged it is 2 - 3 minutes; the best chance of escape is from window or shattering the windshield; and Once submerged it is difficult to open the doors. It is concluded that the installation of crash barriers will have optimum positive effect; Road <b>layout,</b> <b>marking,</b> signposting, and public lighting may increase safety; The vehicle should be designed for adequate protection in an impact; There should be no projecting parts in the cabin; Wearing of seatbelts usually diminishes the severity of the outcome; The vehicle should be watertight for floating capacity; and the doors should never be locked...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between collaboration processes, task strategies {{and the use}} of the tools and resources that the computer environment offers, may be crucial for the effects of computer supported collaborative learning. We are interested to find out how, within a computer environment, students collaborate, how they use the different tools we offer and how this influences the quality of the final product. A custom-made computer-supported environment (TC 3) was implemented that enables pairs of high school students to collaborate in writing an argumentative essay. The essay had to be convincing and based on authentic information sources. TC 3, a groupware program, offers the students as task related and communicative tools: a shared text editor, a chat facility, access to relevant sources of information and a private notepad. Furthermore, some facilities or tools were offered that might promote collaboration on the task: access to the chat history, adaptability of the display <b>layout,</b> <b>marking</b> and searching in information sources and counting the number of words in the shared text. From our analyses we may conclude that the tools and resources the students use during collaborative writing seem to reflect the writing strategies they adhere to and that the use of these tools and resources in the different phases of the collaborative writing process is related to the argumentative quality of the final product. Future research will focus on the effects of adding tools for text planning and linearization to the TC 3 environment on the coordination processes of collaborative writing...|$|R
40|$|The excavation, between 1991 - 1992, ofa branch ofthe Seine in Paris {{revealed}} three neolithic dwellings on {{the south}} bank: two front the middle neolithic period and one front {{the end of the}} neolithic or chalcolithic period. Ten oak dugouts were discovered at the foot of these sites, together with neolitic objects in secondary position, six examples have already been dated using C 14 analysis. The weight of the sediment covering these vestiges (which were substantially deformed) and their rather fragmented state, does not allow for a study of their forms. This can only be done at a later stage, after completion of the conservation and restoration process. However, it is essential to proceed with the analysis of the marks left by the tools (or workmanship traces) before this work due to their being barely visible and their superfìcial aspect. The interest ο f these skiffs is not so much in their form (they are all incomplete) as in the building process. Three of them have carbonised traces protruding from the bottom which is, sometimes, exceptionally thin. This proves that the prehistoric people mastered the practice of hollowing out by fire {{from the beginning of the}} middle neolithic period (n° 1). The use οf different techniques and tools for making the bottom and sides has also been noted. The first one has a szries of parallel lines with the longitudinal axis, made up of a succession of cupulas produced by hitting with an adze. The sides, however, bear oblique traces (n° 3, 7 and 8) sometimes in the form of a group of offset <b>marks,</b> the <b>layout</b> ο f which indicates the uses ο f axes (also confirmed by the space available for thè handle). Finally, occasionai cubie tenons (n° 4), long tenons (n° 3), cross reinforcement (n° 2) and in the case of the dugout 3, a cross groove have been observed. The latter could well correspond to an original means for controlling the thickness of the bottom during the last stage of hollowing out. Thanks to the analysis of the workmanship traces, sometimes very unclear, the Paris-Bercy dugouts, although incomplete, open new perspectives with regards to their function and building techniques. This analysis would have been impossible, seeing the decomposed and fragmented state of the wood, without an excellent collaboration with the team responsible for the restoration work. Arnold Béat.

40|$|Soft skills, {{especially}} communication skills, {{are important}} skills which each graduate must possess. Accordingly, several courses and approaches {{have been carried}} out in universities to train students in communication skills. The skills are normally evaluated by course lecturers. However, assessments by a third party from outside the university are valuable so that the students’ ahievements may be weighed against external evaluators’ point of views. In the Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering (DEESE), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), communication skills assessment by external lecturers and industry representatives are performed on Hari Poster JKEES, where students present their final year project poster. There are two categories of evaluation, namely project and communication skills. The project evaluation covers content, result and impact, while communication skills evaluation covers poster layout and design, and delivery. This study only analyse the students’ communication skills achievement. The participants of this study consists of 109 final year students from two batches, of which 51 students are from year 2014 and the other 58 students from year 2015.
