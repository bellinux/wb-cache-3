She had passed the day in a passion of self-reproach, {{gradually}} mounting from the <b>mental</b> <b>numbness</b> {{in which he had}} left her, and now she could wait no longer to tell him that she saw how she had forsaken him in his hour of trial and left him to bear it alone. She wondered at herself in shame and dismay; she wondered that she could have been so confused as to the real point by that old wretch of a Rogers, that she could have let him hoodwink her so, even for a moment. It astounded her that such a thing should have happened, for if there was any virtue upon which this good woman prided herself, in which she thought herself superior to her husband, it was her instant and steadfast perception of right and wrong, and the ability to choose the right to her own hurt. But she had now to confess, as each of us has had likewise to confess in his own case, that the very virtue on which she had prided herself was the thing that had played her false; that she had kept her mind so long upon that old wrong which she believed her husband had done this man that she could not detach it, but clung to the thought of reparation for it when she ought to have seen that he was proposing a piece of roguery as the means. The suffering which Lapham must inflict on him if he decided against him had been more to her apprehension than the harm he might do if he decided for him. But now she owned her limitations to herself, and above everything in the world she wished the man whom her conscience had roused and driven on whither her intelligence had not followed, to do right, to do what he felt to be right, and nothing else. She admired and revered him for going beyond her, and she wished to tell him that she did not know what he had determined to do about Rogers, but that she knew it was right, and would gladly abide the consequences with him, whatever they were.|$|E

Severe gastrointestinal bleeding is also possible. Cerebral edema, and cardiac arrest with fatal outcome {{have been seen}} in children.|$|R
40|$|Tension pneumocephalus is the {{presence}} of air or gas in the cranium that is under pressure. It occurs due to disruption of the skull, including trauma to the head or face, after neurosurgical procedures and occasionally, spontaneously (Schirmer et al., 2010). Patients typically present with headache but can also have neurological deficits such as decreased <b>mental</b> status, <b>numbness,</b> and weakness (Schirmer et al., 2010). It is diagnosed by computerized tomography (CT) scan (Michel, 2010). The characteristic finding is that the two frontal poles of the brain are separated by air. After diagnosis, treatment is imperative for both symptomatic relief and preventing further compression. We present a case of a patient who presented with tension pneumocephalus and unconventional treatment that resulted in clinical improvement of his symptoms and radiographic resolution of his condition...|$|R
5000|$|In her 2005 book Surviving Intimate Terrorism, Nussbaum {{argued that}} her {{denial of the}} danger she and her {{children}} lived in was typical of some chronically maltreated persons (see battered person syndrome). Nussbaum claimed that she fled from the home six times, only to later return. In her 2005 book, Nussbaum also mentions the medical theory that trauma, especially prolonged trauma, can elicit the body's production of opioids that produce <b>mental</b> and physical <b>numbness.</b> In her 2005 book, Nussbaum also suggests that her [...] "numbness" [...] further reduced her ability to think and act clearly, akin to [...] "Stockholm Syndrome", a mental state wherein victims identify with their abusers.|$|R

The next day, we heard on the radio, in the 'news from the front' (Wehrmachtbericht) about the [...] "successful front correction" [...] in our Yelnya {{defensive}} lines and the enormous losses we inflicted on the enemy. But no single word was heard about a retreat, about the hopelessness of the situation, about the <b>mental</b> and emotional <b>numbness</b> of the German soldiers. In short, it was again a [...] "victory". But we on the front line were running back like rabbits in front of the fox. This metamorphosis of the truth from [...] "all shit" [...] to [...] "it was a victory" [...] baffled me, and those of my comrades who dared to think.|$|R
