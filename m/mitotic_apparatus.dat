The proper alignment and separation of chromosomes is critical to ensure that cells divide their genetic material equally between daughter cells.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and maintenance of}} the bipolar <b>mitotic</b> spindle <b>apparatus</b> require a complex and balanced interplay of several mechanisms, including the stabilization and separation of polar microtubules and the action of various microtubule motors. Nonmicrotubule elements are also present throughout the spindle apparatus and have been proposed to provide a structural support for the spindle. The Nuclear-Mitotic Apparatus protein (NuMA) is an abundant 240 kD protein that {{is present in the}} nucleus of interphase cells and concentrates in the polar regions of the spindle apparatus during mitosis. Sequence analysis indicates that NuMA possesses an unusually long alpha-helical central region characteristic of many filament forming proteins. In this report we demonstrate that microinjection of anti-NuMA antibodies into interphase and prophase cells results in a failure to form a <b>mitotic</b> spindle <b>apparatus.</b> Furthermore, injection of metaphase cells results in the collapse of the spindle apparatus into a monopolar microtubule array. These results identify {{for the first time a}} nontubulin component important for both the establishment and stabilization of the <b>mitotic</b> spindle <b>apparatus</b> in multicellular organisms.

40|$|The {{effects of}} cytochalasin B on three {{different}} biological {{systems have been}} studied with cytological methods. Cytochalasin B stops immediately the cleavage of Tunicate eggs, without preventing nuclear multiplication; however, the <b>mitotic</b> <b>apparatuses</b> are disorganized, {{as indicated by the}} presence of cytasters and anastral mitoses. Cytochalasin B produces fusion of the nucleoli and strong condensation of the chromosomes in amphibian oocytes.

It reversibly stops cytoplasmic streaming. Abnormalities are much more frequent in anucleate fragments when cytochalasin treated fragments of the algae are returned to normal medium.

50|$|While Hepler was {{successful}} in identifying an aggregation of material that possessed microtubule-organizing capacity, {{he was not able}} to specify the biophysical mechanisms involved in organization. After Richard Weisenberg discovered that microtubule polymerization was sensitive to calcium concentration, Hepler realized that he had already seen a close association between elements of the endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules in the <b>mitotic</b> <b>apparatus</b> and in the phragmoplast and suggested that these membranes may function in controlling the concentration of free calcium in the <b>mitotic</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Along with Susan Wick and Steve Wolniak, Hepler showed that the endoplasmic reticulum contained stores of calcium and suggested that the endoplasmic reticulum may locally control the calcium concentration and thus the polymerization/depolymerization of microtubules. Subsequently, Hepler, along with Dale Callaham, Dahong Zhang, and Patricia Wadsworth, observed calcium ion transients during mitosis and showed that the microinjection of calcium ions into the mitotic spindle does regulate the depolymerization of microtubules and the movement of chromosomes to the poles during mitosis.|$|E
40|$|An {{antiserum}} to flagellar axonemes from sperm of Arbacia punctulata contains antibodies which react {{both with}} intact flagellar outer fibers and with purified tubulin {{from the outer}} fibers. Immunodiffusion tests indicate the presence of similar antigenic determinants on outer-fiber tubulins from sperm flagella of five species of sea urchins and a sand dollar, but not a starfish. The antibodies also react with extracts containing tubulins from different classes of microtubules, including central-pair fibers and both A- and B-subfibers from outer fibers of sperm flagella, an extract from unfertilized eggs, <b>mitotic</b> <b>apparatuses</b> from first cleavage embryos, and cilia from later embryos. Though most tubulins tested share similar antigenic determinants, some clear differences have been detected, even, in Pseudoboletia indiana, between the outer-fiber tubulins of sperm flagella and blastular cilia. Though tubulins are "actin-like" proteins, antitubulin serum does not react with actin from sea urchin lantern muscle.

40|$|During the mitotic {{division}} cycle, cells {{pass through}} an extensive microtubule rearrangement process where microtubules forming the <b>mitotic</b> spindle <b>apparatus</b> are dynamically instable. Several centrosomal- and microtubule-associated proteins {{are involved in}} the regulation of microtubule dynamics and stability during mitosis. Here, we focus on members of the transforming acidic coiled coil (TACC) family of centrosomal adaptor proteins, in particular TACC 3, in which their subcellular localization at the <b>mitotic</b> spindle <b>apparatus</b> is controlled by Aurora-A kinase-mediated phosphorylation. At the effector level, several TACC-binding partners have been identified and characterized in greater detail, in particular, the microtubule polymerase XMAP 215 /ch-TOG/CKAP 5 and clathrin heavy chain (CHC). We summarize the recent progress in the molecular understanding of these TACC 3 protein complexes, which are crucial for proper mitotic spindle assembly and dynamics to prevent faulty cell division and aneuploidy.

Our evidence includes the observation that the deduced amino acid sequence of this sea urchin kinesin heavy chain is characteristic of a conventional kinesin. In addition, immunolocalizations using antibodies that distinguish kinesin from kinesin-like proteins confirm that conventional kinesin is concentrated in MAs. Finally, our immunocytochemical data further suggest that conventional kinesin is associated with membranes which accumulate in MAs and interphase asters of early sea urchin embryos, and with vesicles that are distributed in the perinuclear region of coelomocytes. Thus kinesin may function as a microtubule-based vesicle motor in some MAs, {{as well as in}} the interphase cytoplasm...|$|R

50|$|Most bony {{fish eggs}} are {{referred}} to as telolecithal which means that most of the egg cell cytoplasm is yolk. The yolky end of the egg (the vegetal pole) remains homogenous while the other end (the animal pole) undergoes cell division. Cleavage, or initial cell division, can only occur in a region called the blastodisc, a yolk free region located at the animal pole of the egg. The fish zygote is meroblastic, meaning the early cell divisions are not complete. This type of meroblastic cleavage is called discoidal because only the blastodisc becomes the embryo. In fish, waves of calcium released direct the process of cell division by coordinating the <b>mitotic</b> <b>apparatus</b> with the actin cytoskeleton, propagating cell division along the surface, assists in deepening the cleavage furrow, and finally heals the membrane after separation of blastomeres.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, it {{participates in}} several {{processes}} required for cell growth and proliferation, including cytoskeleton organization, <b>mitotic</b> <b>apparatus</b> formation, and signal transduction. This protein colocalizes with filamentous actin (F-actin) {{and is just}} as abundantly expressed. eEF1A putatively binds actin and microtubules at synapses to modulate the cytoskeleton. In neurons, this ability allows for regulation of the number and size of inhibitory postsynaptic complexes like postsynaptic gephyrin clusters. eEF1A has also been found to bind to several kinases, phospholipases, and synaptic proteins. For instance, while associated with actin, it can activate phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, which then regulates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels. This protein can also act as a membrane receptor for the cryptic antiadhesive site of fibronectin, thus inhibiting cell anchorage and promoting apoptosis, or anoikis. Though {{it has not been}} observed to localize to the cell membrane, it {{can be found in the}} outer cell surface. Its role in apoptosis may also contribute to regulation of cell growth and the immune response.|$|E
50|$|The tankyrases (TNKs) are PARPs that {{comprise}} ankyrin repeats, an oligomerization domain (SAM), and a PARP catalytic domain (PCD). Tankyrases are {{also known as}} PARP-5a and PARP-5b. They were named for their interaction with the telomere-associated TRF1 proteins and ankyrin repeats. They may allow the removal of telomerase-inhibiting complexes from chromosome ends to allow for telomere maintenance. Through their SAM domain and ANKs, they can oligomerize and interact with many other proteins, such as TRF1, TAB182 (TNKS1BP1), GRB14, IRAP, NuMa, EBNA-1, and Mcl-1. They have multiple roles in the cell, vesicular trafficking through its interaction in GLUT4 vesicles with insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP). It also {{plays a role in}} mitotic spindle assembly through its interaction with nuclear <b>mitotic</b> <b>apparatus</b> protein 1 (NuMa), therefore allowing the necessary bipolar orientation. In the absence of TNKs, mitosis arrest is observed in pre-anaphase through Mad2 spindle checkpoint. TNKs can also PARsylate Mcl-1L and Mcl-1S and inhibit both their pro- and anti-apoptotic function. Relevance of this is not yet known.|$|E

40|$|Isolated <b>mitotic</b> <b>apparatuses</b> (MA) of clam and {{sea urchin}} eggs were {{investigated}} by polarizing and electron microscopy. Examination of fixed MA in oils of different refractive index revealed {{that at least}} 90 % of the retardation of isolated MA is due to positive, form birefringence, the remaining retardation deriving from positive, intrinsic birefringence. Electron micrographs reveal the isolated MA to be composed of microtubules, ribosome-like particles, {{and a variety of}} vesicles. In the clam MA the number of vesicles and ribosome-like particles relative to the number of microtubules is much lower than in the sea urchin MA. In clam MA this allows form and intrinsic birefringence to be related directly to microtubules. The relation of birefringence to microtubules in isolated sea urchin MA is more complex since ribosome-like particles adhere to microtubules, are oriented by them, and are likely to contribute to the form birefringence of the isolated MA. However, comparison of values of retardation for clam and sea urchin MA, indicates that the major part of the birefringence in sea urchin MA is also due to microtubules. The interpretation of the structures giving rise to birefringence in the MA of the living cells is likely to be even more complex since masking substances, compression, or tension on the living MA may alter the magnitude or sign of the birefringence...|$|R
