40|$|AbstractThe {{statement}} ‘phytic acid is ubiquitously {{present in}} non-ruminant animal diets’ is often made in scientific manuscripts oriented toward phytase, mineral and amino acid nutrition, <b>monogastric</b> <b>animal</b> performance and skeletal development. However, {{it is increasingly}} the case that this statement is at best misleading and at worst entirely incorrect. Phytase bioefficacy is at an unprecedented high in {{the life cycle of}} this technology and product cost is at an all-time low, two factors which have contributed to a climb in inclusion concentration and an axiomatic decrease in dietary phytic acid concentration. Though complete dephytinisation of <b>monogastric</b> <b>animal</b> diets may be unrealistic due to the presence of variable concentrations of recalcitrant phytic acid in localized regions of cereals, oilseed meals and grain legumes, the vast majority of reactive phytic acid is rapidly degraded to innocuous lower esters in the proximal GI tract. Thus, the nutritional paradigm has shifted from formulating diets to accommodate the presence of phytase to formulating diets to accommodate the absence of phytic acid. These are not trivial distinctions but may have considerable implications for animal performance and the optimal balance of nutrients in the diet. It is {{the purpose of the present}} article to consider the breadth of effect of the ingestion of phytic acid and the likely consequence of an ostensibly dephytinized diet on nutrition and animal performance. The concept of ‘phytate-free nutrition’ is posited and nutritional strategies to maximise the likelihood of observing measurable benefits from the lack of this nutritional obstacle are discussed around three conceptual pillars: phosphorus, extra-phosphoric effects and myo-inositol...|$|E

Distilled dried grains with solubles (DDGS) is widely used in animal diets because of its availability and cost-effective benefits for sustainable animal production (Spiehs et al. 2002).

Thereafter, adsorption was evaluated applying different isotherms models, such as Freundlich, Langmuir, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Redlich-Peterson, to characterize the adsorption process as being either homo- or heterogeneous, and represents either mono- or multilayer binding. At the recommended statutory level for the mycotoxins of 0. 1 mg Kg- 1 OTA and 0. 5 mg Kg- 1 ZEN, OAB showed an adsorbed capacity of > 96 % towards both mycotoxins, regardless of the pH. The HAP product was also able to absorb > 96 % of both mycotoxins at pH 3. 0, but extensive desorption occurred at pH 8. 4. Based on chi-square (Chi 2) values, Langmuir and Redlich-Peterson equations proved to be the best models to predict monolayer equilibrium sorption of OTA and ZEN, onto the organically activated bentonite and the humic acid polymer.

High-tannin hulls of faba beans and isolated tannins were shown to induce a rapid hypertrophy of the parotid glands in rats and increase the secretion of salivary proline-rich proteins with a high affinity for tannins. In this way rats are able to defend themselves against more harmful effects of tannins. The growth performance of chickens on diets containing 300 g/kg of either low-tannin or hightannin faba beans did not differ. In contrast, the apparent ileal and faecal digestibility in pigs of protein and amino acids differed significantly between both types of beans, in favour of the low-tannin beans. Inclusion of hulls of faba beans with either a low or a high tannin content in diets for piglets revealed that tannins in faba beans reduce in particular the apparent faecal digestibility of protein and amino acids and the N balance. No systemic/toxic effects of feeding high-tannin hulls to pigs were found. The activity of trypsin and, to a lesser extent, chymotrypsin was reduced in digesta collected from the small intestine of pigs.

Wheat screening is one of the these sources of feed which need to be considered. Determination of physicochemical content, metabolizable energy (ME) and protein digestibility may lead to elucidate the quality of this feed as well as arrangement in feed formulation of broiler ration. Physical content of two types of wheat screening (W. S.) were tested by seed sorting system (grad 1 and 2), lots of straw, sand, dust, soil and none cereal seed were observed in wheat screening grads 2 compared with wheat screening grade 1. In addition 80 % of wheat screening includes wheat screening grads 1 which content less Straw, soil, sand and none cereal seed. Otherwise metabolizable energy which was estimated by Sibbaled method was significantly higher (P< 0. 05), In W. S. grad 1 (2992. 51 kcal/kg) than grad 2 (2212. 72 kcal/kg). Based on these finding wheat screening grads 1 was selected for broiler feeding. Crude protein and crude fibre (11. 4 and 4. 14 %) respectively in chemical composition of wheat screening grad 1 were determined by AOAC method. In-vitro protein digestibility 81. 7 % and digestible energy 2352. 73 kcal/kg in wheat screening grad 1 were quiet desirable which evaluated by Fuller method.

Fish, a <b>monogastric</b> <b>animal</b> is lacking of capability to digest fiber in higher percentage. Hence, PKC is not suitable for monogastrics animal as feed without any pretreatment or supplementation. The thesis researched on the β-mannanase production {{and the addition of}} this enzyme as supplement in feed formulation containing PKC for red tilapia hybrid (Oreochromis sp.). The study started with the selection of β-mannanase producing microorganism from the fermented PKC was conducted. The optimal temperature and pH for purified β-mannanase activity produced by the Bacillus subtilis H was at 50 oC and pH 8. 0; respectively. The crude enzyme showed stability over a broad range of pH 4. 5 - 10. 0 and displayed relatively high activity on elements such as Mg, K, Mn, Na, Cu and Ca that has been reported present in PKC. These properties make the β-mannanase more useful in the animal feed and detergent industries. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used for the optimization experiments. The effect of medium composition and culture conditions to enhance the production of enzyme, in shake flask and fermenter; respectively was then studied. The highest β-mannanase production in shake flasks, had demonstrated the used of relatively low cost ingredients of 53. 8 g/l PKC, 2. 0 g/l yeast extract, 2. 5 g/l (NH 4) 2 SO 4 and 4. 0 g/l NH 4 NO 3. However the production of enzyme was far much lower in fermenter as compared to shake flask experiment. Supplementation of protectant during freeze drying process for preserving of protein activity was also conducted. Skim milk showed the largest effect in preserving the β-mannanase activity when exposed to all tested environment or conditions. It can be concluded that the empirical model developed through RSM in terms of effective medium composition, culture condition and protectant addition during freeze drying were found adequate to describe the optimal values for all experiments. β-Mannanase can degrade mannan structure in PKC however it is considered as a costly approach and a significant reduction in cost will be important for their commercial use. The optimal condition for enzymatic saccharification of PKC was then studied. The evaluation on the influence of β-mannanase supplementation to the fish feed containing PKC on red tilapia was then conducted. During the growth experiment, the final body weight, weight gain and feed conversion ratio were significantly better in tilapia fed diet with enzyme supplementation. The inclusion of enzyme could also reduced the released of ammonia to the cultured environment. In conclusion, supplementation β-mannanase in the diet containing 40 % of PKC could improved the growth performance, energy and nutrient digestibility of tilapia, thus would increased the nutritional value of PKC as feed ingredient...|$|E

For this purpose, the green crops were processed into a nitrogen-rich protein concentrate, a fiber-rich press cake, and a residual stream of soluble nutrients (brown juice). The process, which involved a novel protein refining technique using lactic acid fermentation, yielded between 6 kg and 13 kg of dry organic protein product per ton of fresh crop.
