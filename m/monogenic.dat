25|$|A {{complement}} to specific gene testing for <b>monogenic</b> disorders, {{which can be}} very useful for genetic diseases whose presentation {{is linked to the}} sex, such as, for example, X-linked diseases.|$|E
25|$|Other {{forms of}} {{diabetes}} mellitus include congenital diabetes, which {{is due to}} genetic defects of insulin secretion, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, steroid diabetes induced by high doses of glucocorticoids, and several forms of <b>monogenic</b> diabetes.|$|E
25|$|All {{disorders}} {{within this}} group {{are thought to}} be <b>monogenic,</b> meaning they arise from mutations of a single gene. Most known PS are due to genetic mutations that lead to either defects in the DNA repair mechanism or defects in lamin A/C.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{as in the}} {{two-dimensional}} (complex analysis) case, {{the value}} of an analytic (<b>monogenic)</b> function at a point can be found by an integral over the surface surrounding the point, and this is valid not only for scalar functions but vector and general multivector functions as well.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s, as the {{understanding}} of the pathophysiology of diabetes has improved, the concept and usage of MODY have become refined and narrower. It is now used as a synonym for dominantly inherited, <b>monogenic</b> defects of insulin secretion occurring at any age, and no longer includes any forms of type 2 diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Homozygous {{mutations}} {{in the other}} forms {{have not yet been}} described. Those mutations for which a homozygous form has not been described may be extremely rare, may result in clinical problems not yet recognized as connected to the <b>monogenic</b> disorder, or may be lethal for a fetus and not result in a viable child.|$|E
25|$|As {{a pioneer}} of single-molecule biophysical chemistry, {{coherent}} Raman scattering microscopy, and single-cell genomics, he made major contributions {{to the emergence of}} these fields. Furthermore, he has made significant advances on medical applications of label-free optical imaging and single-cell genomics. In particular, his inventions in single-cell genomics have been used in in vitro fertilization to benefit hundreds of couples in China by avoiding the transmission of <b>monogenic</b> diseases to their newborns.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{panel of}} {{associated}} genetic markers have been established for a particular disease {{it can be used}} for all carriers of that disease. In contrast, since even a <b>monogenic</b> disease can be caused by many different mutations within the affected gene, conventional PGD methods based on finding a specific mutation would require mutation-speciﬁc tests. Thus, PGH widens the availability of PGD to cases where mutation-specific tests are unavailable.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacology {{has become}} {{increasingly}} sophisticated; modern biotechnology allows drugs targeted towards specific physiological processes to be developed, sometimes designed for compatibility with the body to reduce side-effects. Genomics and knowledge of human genetics is having some influence on medicine, as the causative genes of most <b>monogenic</b> genetic disorders have now been identified, {{and the development of}} techniques in molecular biology and genetics are influencing medical technology, practice and decision-making.|$|E
25|$|Single gene {{mutations}} {{can cause}} Mendelian forms of high blood pressure; ten genes {{have been identified}} which cause these <b>monogenic</b> forms of hypertension. These mutations affect blood pressure by altering renal salt handling. There is greater similarity in blood pressure within families than between families, which indicates a form of inheritance, {{and this is not}} due to shared environmental factors. With the aid of genetic analysis techniques, a statistically significant linkage of blood pressure to several chromosomal regions, including regions linked to familial combined hyperlipidemia, was found. These findings suggest that there are many genetic loci, in the general population, each with small effects on blood pressure. Overall, however, identifiable single-gene causes of hypertension are uncommon, consistent with a multifactorial cause of essential hypertension.|$|E
25|$|PGD is {{available}} for {{a large number of}} <b>monogenic</b> disorders—that is, disorders due to a single gene only (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X-linked)—or of chromosomal structural aberrations (such as a balanced translocation). PGD helps these couples identify embryos carrying a genetic disease or a chromosome abnormality, thus avoiding diseased offspring. The most frequently diagnosed autosomal recessive disorders are cystic fibrosis, Beta-thalassemia, sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1. The most common dominant diseases are myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease; {{and in the case of}} the X-linked diseases, most of the cycles are performed for fragile X syndrome, haemophilia A and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Though it is quite infrequent, some centers report PGD for mitochondrial disorders or two indications simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|PGD {{is a form}} {{of genetic}} {{diagnosis}} performed prior to implantation. This implies that the patient’s oocytes should be fertilized in vitro and the embryos kept in culture until the diagnosis is established. It is also necessary to perform a biopsy on these embryos in order to obtain material on which to perform the diagnosis. The diagnosis itself can be carried out using several techniques, depending {{on the nature of the}} studied condition. Generally, PCR-based methods are used for <b>monogenic</b> disorders and FISH for chromosomal abnormalities and for sexing those cases in which no PCR protocol is available for an X-linked disease. These techniques need to be adapted to be performed on blastomeres and need to be thoroughly tested on single-cell models prior to clinical use. Finally, after embryo replacement, surplus good quality unaffected embryos can be cryopreserved, to be thawed and transferred back in a next cycle.|$|E
25|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent, potentially lethal, <b>monogenic</b> human disorder. It is associated with large interfamilial and intrafamilial variability, which can be explained {{to a large extent}} by its genetic heterogeneity and modifier genes. It is also the most common of the inherited cystic kidney diseases — a group of disorders with related but distinct pathogenesis, characterized by the development of renal cysts and various extrarenal manifestations, which in case of ADPKD include cysts in other organs, such as the liver, seminal vesicles, pancreas, and arachnoid membrane, as well as other abnormalities, such as intracranial aneurysms and dolichoectasias, aortic root dilatation and aneurysms, mitral valve prolapse, and abdominal wall hernias. Over 50% of patients with ADPKD eventually develop end stage kidney disease and require dialysis or kidney transplantation. ADPKD is estimated to affect at least 1 in every 1000 individuals worldwide, making this disease the most common inherited kidney disorder with a diagnosed prevalence of 1:2000 and incidence of 1:3000-1:8000 in a global scale.|$|E
25|$|Severe <b>monogenic</b> {{diseases}} {{for which}} prenatal diagnosis is more commonly applied to include cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, fragile-X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Hemophilia. Both autosomal dominant and recessive disorders {{have been detected}} noninvasively by analyzing paternally inherited DNA. Limitations to single gene disorders are autosomal recessive mutation or when the fetal autosomal dominant mutation is maternally inherited. There are also large sequence mutations that include duplication, expansion, insertion of DNA sequences. cffDNA is fragmented with 200-300bp in length, thus these are harder to detect. One example is achondroplasia, a common autosomal dominant form of dwarfism, caused by FGFR3 gene point mutations. Two pregnancies were examined in this study, one fetus {{was found to have}} the paternally inherited G1138A mutation and the other with a G1138A de novo mutation. Another example is the Huntington's disease. It is currently diagnosed at 10–13 weeks at gestation with chronic villus sampling for polymorphic repeats. With qRT-PCR, there has been detection of CAG repeats at 17, 20 and 24, all normal levels.|$|E
