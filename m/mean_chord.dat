50|$|<b>Mean</b> Aerodynamic <b>Chord</b> (MAC): A {{specific}} {{chord line}} of a tapered wing. At the <b>mean</b> aerodynamic <b>chord,</b> the center of pressure has the same aerodynamic force, position, and area as it does {{on the rest of}} the wing. The MAC represents the width of an equivalent rectangular wing in given conditions. On some aircraft, the center of gravity is expressed as a percentage of the length of the MAC. In order to make such a calculation, the position of the leading edge of the MAC must be known ahead of time. This position is defined as a distance from the reference datum and is found in the aircraft's flight manual and also on the aircraft's type certificate data sheet. If a general MAC is not given but a LeMAC (leading edge <b>mean</b> aerodynamic <b>chord)</b> and a TeMAC (trailing edge <b>mean</b> aerodynamic <b>chord)</b> are given (both of which would be referenced as an arm measured out from the datum line) then your MAC can be found by finding the difference between your LeMAC and your TeMAC.|$|R
50|$|The short-span, narrow <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> (16 in or 406 mm) {{cantilever}} wing was built of wood {{like the rest}} of the T.G.N.1. It had three parts, two plywood-skinned lifting sections each 15 ft (4.57 m) long joined by a 3 ft (910 mm) centre section. The single wing spar was a 4×3 in (102×76 mm) spruce beam. The wing was straight edged and tapered by sweep on the leading edge only. The trailing edges carried full-span ailerons with the inboard half-spans divided into three sections. These inner surfaces moved through progressively smaller angles than the outer ones and could be lowered as camber changing flaps or airbrakes.|$|E
50|$|The lift from wings is {{proportional}} to their area, so the heavier the animal or aircraft the bigger that area must be. The area {{is the product of}} the span times the width (<b>mean</b> <b>chord)</b> of the wing, so either a long, narrow wing or a shorter, broader wing will support the same mass. For efficient steady flight, the ratio of span to chord, the aspect ratio, should be as high as possible (the constraints are usually structural) because this lowers the lift-induced drag associated with the inevitable wingtip vortices. Long-ranging birds, like albatrosses, and most commercial aircraft maximize aspect ratio. Alternatively, animals and aircraft which depend on maneuverability (fighters, predators and the predated, and those who live amongst trees and bushes, insect catchers, etc.) {{need to be able to}} roll fast to turn, and the high moment of inertia of long narrow wings produces lower roll rates. For them, short-span, broad wings are preferred.|$|E

In every case, the dose <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length was greater than the frequency <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length with a 34. 5 % increase found for the least extreme case of a cube.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{system matrix}} {{is required for}} quantitative proton CT (pCT) image reconstruction with iterative projection algorithms. The system matrix is composed of chord lengths of individual proton path intersections with reconstruction pixels. In previous work, reconstructions were performed assuming constant intersection chord lengths, which led to systematic errors of the reconstructed proton stopping powers. The {{purpose of the present}} work was to introduce a computationally efficient variable intersection chord length in order to improve the accuracy of the system matrix. An analytical expression that takes into account the discrete stepping nature of the pCT most likely path (MLP) reconstruction procedure was created to describe an angle-dependent effective <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length function. A pCT dataset was simulated with GEANT 4 using a parallel beam of 200 MeV protons intersecting a computerized head phantom consisting of tissue-equivalent materials with known relative stopping power. The phantom stopping powers were reconstructed with the constant chord length, exact chord length, and effective <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length approaches, in combination with the algebraic reconstruction technique. Relative stopping power errors were calculated for each anatomical phantom region and compared for the various methods. It was found that the error of approximately 10 % in the mean reconstructed stopping power value for a given anatomical region, resulting from a system matrix with a constant chord length, could be reduced to less than 0. 5 % with either the effective <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length or exact chord length approaches. Reconstructions with the effective <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length were found to be approximately 20 % faster than reconstructions with an exact chord length. The effective <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length method provides the possibility for more accurate, computationally efficient quantitative pCT reconstructions...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a parallel benchmark procedure and numerical results for a three-dimensional binary stochastic medium particle transport benchmark problem. The binary stochastic medium {{is composed of}} optically thick spherical inclusions distributed in an optically thin background matrix material. We investigate three sphere <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> lengths, three distributions for the sphere radii (constant, uniform, and exponential), and six sphere volume fractions ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 3. For each sampled independent material realization, we solve the associated transport problem using the Mercury Monte Carlo particle transport code. We compare the ensemble-averaged benchmark fiducial tallies of reflection from and transmission through the spatial domain as well as absorption in the spherical inclusion and background matrix materials. For the parameter values investigated, we find a significant dependence of the ensemble-averaged fiducial tallies on both sphere <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length and sphere volume fraction, with the most dramatic variation occurring for the transmission through the spatial domain. We find a weaker dependence of most benchmark tally quantities on the distribution describing the sphere radii, provided the sphere <b>mean</b> <b>chord</b> length used is {{the same in the}} different distributions.

40|$|This article {{outlines}} a new control {{approach for}} flapping-wing micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs), in-spired both by biological systems {{and by the}} need for lightweight actuation and control solutions. In our approach, the aerodynamic forces required for agile motions are achieved indirectly, by modifying passive impedance properties that couple motion of the power stroke to the angle of attack (AoA) of the wing. This strategy is theoretically appealing because it can ex-ploit an invariant, cyclical power stroke, for efficiency, and because an impedance-adjusting strategy should also require lower bandwidth, weight, and power than direct, intra-wingbeat control of AoA. We examine the theoretical range of control torques and forces {{that can be achieved}} using this method and conclude that it is a plausible method of control. Our results demon-strate the potential of a passive dynamic design and control approach in reducing mechanical complexity, weight and power consumption of an MAV while achiev-ing the aerodynamic forces required for the types of high-fidelity maneuvers that drive current interest in au-tonomous, flapping-wing robotics.

When the vehicle is moved relative to the first fluid medium at a velocity within a range of predetermined velocities, with each of the velocities having a direction inclined from a plane extending through the leading edge and the trailing edge within a predetermined angular range, a region of high pressure is generated in the first fluid medium adjacent the first major surface and a region of low pressure is generated in the first fluid medium adjacent the second major surface.
