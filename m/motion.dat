5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity <b>motion</b> across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} <b>motion</b> while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this <b>motion</b> as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity <b>motion.</b>|$|E
5|$|All the same, the {{conspicuousness}} of <b>motion</b> {{raises the}} question of whether and how <b>motion</b> itself could be camouflaged. Several mechanisms are possible.|$|E

40|$|Using the {{framework}} of random walks in random scenery, Cohen and Samorodnitsky (2006) introduced a family of symmetric α-stable <b>motions</b> called local time fractional stable <b>motions.</b> When α= 2, these processes are precisely fractional Brownian <b>motions</b> with 1 / 2 <H< 1. Motivated by random walks in alternating scenery, we find a "complementary" family of symmetric α-stable <b>motions</b> which we call indicator fractional stable <b>motions.</b> These processes are complementary to local time fractional stable <b>motions</b> in that when α= 2, one gets fractional Brownian <b>motions</b> with 0 <H< 1 / 2.

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{fundamental}} challenges of physical biology is to {{understand the relationship between}} protein dynamics and function. At physiological temperatures, functional <b>motions</b> arise from the complex interplay of thermal <b>motions</b> of proteins and their environments. Here, we determine the hierarchy in the protein conformational energy landscape that underlies these <b>motions,</b> based on a series of temperature-dependent magic-angle spinning multinuclear nuclear-magnetic-resonance relaxation measurements in a hydrated nanocrystalline protein. The results support strong coupling between protein and solvent dynamics above 160 kelvin, with fast solvent <b>motions,</b> slow protein side-chain <b>motions,</b> and fast protein backbone <b>motions</b> being activated consecutively. Low activation energy, small-amplitude local <b>motions</b> dominate at low temperatures, with larger-amplitude, anisotropic, and functionally relevant <b>motions</b> involving entire peptide units becoming dominant at temperatures above 220 kelvin...|$|R
5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics {{is the notion that}} a body's <b>motion</b> can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) <b>motion,</b> and deviations from this free <b>motion.</b> Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of <b>motion,</b> which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free <b>motion</b> move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} {{asymptotic}} <b>motions</b> of 3 -parametric robot manipulators with parallel rotational axes. To describe them {{we use the}} theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras. An example of such <b>motions</b> are <b>motions</b> with the zero Coriolis accelerations. We will show that there are asymptotic <b>motions</b> with nonzero Coriolis accelerations. We introduce the notions of the Klein subspace, the Coriolis subspace and show their relation to asymptotic <b>motions</b> of robot manipulators. The asymptotic <b>motions</b> are introduced without explicit use of the Levi-Civita connection...|$|R

5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are made ineffective by movement: a deer or grasshopper may be highly cryptic when motionless, but instantly seen when it moves. But one method, <b>motion</b> dazzle, requires rapidly moving bold patterns of contrasting stripes. <b>Motion</b> dazzle may degrade predators' ability {{to estimate the}} prey's speed and direction accurately, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. <b>Motion</b> dazzle distorts speed perception and is most effective at high speeds; stripes can also distort perception of size (and so, perceived range to the target). As of 2011, <b>motion</b> dazzle had been proposed for military vehicles, but never applied. Since <b>motion</b> dazzle patterns would make animals more difficult to locate accurately when moving, but easier to see when stationary, {{there would be an}} evolutionary trade-off between <b>motion</b> dazzle and crypsis.|$|E
