40|$|A new {{flip-chip}} solder {{technology has}} been developed for the precision self-alignment of an optoelectronic module without using <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops.</b> A main feature of the technology is the controlled self-alignment sequence: laser is aligned to a polymer waveguide in the lateral and vertical directions, then it slowly makes a contact with the waveguide in the axial direction. The elimination {{of the use of}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops</b> significantly simplifies the process. The axial distance between the laser and the waveguide is very small; it is determined by the contacting edges and a tilt angle of 12 o. The lateral alignment accuracy is less than 2 m. Introduction Solder self-alignment is important in the area of optoelectronics.

40|$|Development of the Body Flap Actuation Subsystem for Space Shuttles {{included}} alterations {{from the}} original design to <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops,</b> planet gears, control valves, and solenoid valves. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops</b> were redesigned to absorb stall load and rotating inertia of the hydraulic motors instead of only stall load. The institution of a quill shaft (torsion spring) was a successful solution. The planet gears in the geared rotary actuators developed cracks during testing. This failure was alleviated via modification to the gears. A motor pressurization - brake release timing technique was developed thru analysis and testing. This resulted in a control valve configuration which would not permit freewheeling of the body flap surface. Finally, several solenoid valve configurations were tested to obtain the desired performance. Conceptual redesigns and modifications were weighted against each other to optimize a solution. Tradeoffs were usually made between life, performance, failure tolerance, and reliability versus weight, envelope, and maintainability...|$|R

A flip chip assembly approach is presented using the self-alignment mechanism in combination with <b>mechanical</b> <b>stops.</b> Besides eutectic AuSn 20 solder (80 wt. -% Au, Tm = 280 °C) which is widely used in optoelectronics the eutectic SnAg 3. 5 solder (96. 5 wt. -% Sn, Tm = 221 °C) was tested as an alternative which is compatible to organic substrates. Both types of solder bumps were deposited using electroplating and were reflowed prior to flip chip assembly.
