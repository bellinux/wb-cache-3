5|$|Caragiale used Mitică as a stock {{character}} to feature in satirical contexts; the biographical insights he provided are short and often contradict each other. Among Mitică's traits are his tendency to generate sarcastic comebacks and sententious catchphrases, a Francized speech, {{as well as}} inclinations to waste time and easily find {{his way out of}} problematic situations. His existence is connected to events in the history of Bucharest which he occasionally references in his jokes. Like Lache and <b>Mache,</b> who are present in Caragiale's fiction, the character is usually portrayed as a civil servant who has a hard time making ends meet, but who is well liked by his peers.|$|E
5|$|Stegosaurus {{made its}} major public debut as a papier <b>mache</b> model {{commissioned}} by the U.S. National Museum of Natural History for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. The model was based on Knight's latest miniature with the double row of staggered plates, and was exhibited in the United States Government Building at the exposition in St. Louis before being relocated to Portland, Oregon for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in 1905. The model {{was moved to the}} Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (now the Arts and Industries Building) in Washington, D.C. along with other prehistory displays, and to the current National Museum of Natural History building in 1911. Following renovations to the museum in the 2010s, the model was moved once again for display at the Museum of the Earth in Ithaca, New York.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{masks are}} a dancer’s prized possession. Most dancers {{try to keep}} their mask in new {{condition}} and will take masks in to be cleaned and repainted. In a number of communities, such as the Chontals in Tabasco, masks are generally kept in the local church when not in use. At {{the other end of}} the spectrum, the masking, wearing and destruction of a mask is part of Holy Week rituals among the Cora, Yaqui and Mayo. The Cora destroy their paper <b>mache</b> masks by immersing them in a local river while the Yaqui and Mayo burn them. In both cases, it is an act of purification.|$|E
5000|$|Zoomusicology is {{the study}} of the music of {{non-human}} animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, [...] "do animals have music?"

Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that [...] "in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human." ...|$|R
5000|$|John Blacking defines animal music as, [...] "sounds {{produced}} by other species {{that we can}} hear as organized," [...] while Kathleen Higgins adds that humans must {{also be able to}} empathize with these sounds.

40|$|Abstract. The article {{sketches}} {{an introductory}} outline of zoomusicology {{as a discipline}} closely related to zoosemiotics, focusing on the existing results and formulating few further problems. The analysis addresses the limitations and potentials of zoomusicological research, problematic topics, a basic frame-work of possible methodologies, and an attempt to situate the discipline in re-lation to other fields, ethnomusicology in particular. The role of zoomusicology Zoomusicology is a very young discipline. If the first appearance of the word ornithomusicology is dated 1963, thanks to Peter Szöke, zoomusicology is a much younger term, coined in F. B. <b>Mâche’s</b> u-sic, Myth, Nature in 1992. It seems clear that most approaches to the discipline, and to others concerning animals, show strong signs of anthropocentrism. If science aspires to impartiality and exactitude, then these fields of science should try to avoid such a tendency. More properly, any study concerning animals should lean toward “biocen-trism”. This {{does not mean that}} humans should turn into salmon. When geocentric theories were replaced by heliocentrism, scholars didn’t move from the earth to the sun in order to observe the motion of our planet. They just considered it as a part of something much bigger, stressing the similiarites earth shared with the other planets, and see...|$|R
25|$|Mexican mask-folk art {{refers to}} the making and use of masks for various {{traditional}} dances and ceremony in Mexico. Evidence of mask making in the country extends {{for thousands of years}} and was a well-established part of ritual life in Mexico when the Spanish arrived. In the early colonial period, evangelists took advantage of native customs of dance and mask to teach the Catholic faith although later, colonial authorities tried to ban both unsuccessfully. After Independence, mask and dance traditions showed a syncretism and mask traditions have continued to evolve into new forms, depicting Mexico’s history and newer forms of popular culture such as lucha libre. Most traditional masks are made of wood, with others made from leather, wax, cardboard, paper <b>mache</b> and other materials. Common depictions in masks include Europeans (Spanish, French, hacienda owners, etc.), Afro-Mexicans, old men and women, animals, and the fantastic/supernatural, especially demons/the Devil.|$|E
25|$|The {{event is}} {{alternatively}} known as La Noche de los Alebrijes (Night of the Alebrijes), and the Desfile y Concurso de Alebrijes Monumentales del MAP (Monumental Alebrije Parade and Contest of MAP). The parade and contest is {{organized by the}} Museo de Arte Popular, {{in collaboration with the}} federal and city secretariats of culture, the authorities of the historic center of Mexico City, the Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes, the Associación de Amigos del MAP and the BBDO company. Its purpose is a homage to Mexican handcrafts and folk art, especially cartonería (a kind of very hard paper <b>mache)</b> in order to restore value to it in modern society. In the spring or early summer, the Museo de Art Popular puts out an open call for participants, inviting individual artists and artisans along with museums, galleries, hotels, restaurants, businesses and public and private institutions. Notable artisans who have participated include Arturo Caballero Arroyo, Ricardo Hernández, Esteban G. Vargas, Laila Yamille Sabag, Enriqueta Landgrave Zamora and Fabián Hernández. Alebrijes have been sponsored by organizations such as CONACULTA, el Taller Los Olvidados, El FARO de Oriente, Arte en Papel, the Centro Cultural Xavier Villarrutia, Librarte, Arte Mexicano para el Mundo and the Mexico City Secretariat of Culture.|$|E

2500|$|Leather masks {{can cover}} the face or the entire head, such as nin just hur {{those of the}} fariséos of the Mayo and Yaqui. On these masks, facial {{features}} are generally painted on and cuts are made for the eyes. These masks may be supported by wood frames. In some cases, the mask is the dried and preserved face of an animal. Some of the most traditional Carnival masks are made {{with a kind of}} molded leather called “suela,” which is soaked and molded to the wearers face. One example of these are those used by Carnival dancers in Huejotzingo, which are supported by a wire frame with a beard of human hair. An example of cloth masks include those of El Doctor, Querétaro, which are made with cloth strips handled like paper <b>mache.</b> Another type is made by stretching felt over a mold. Cloth masks which are translucent are used for those who are non-believers as they have not yet “seen the light of Christ” in pastorela plays. Paper <b>mache</b> (cartonería) [...] masks are made in Celaya, Guanajuato and Mexico City, generally used by children for Carnival and Independence Day festivities. Cardboard is sometimes used, as a flat piece with eyes and mouth. Among the Afro-Mexicans in Oaxaca, these masks are carefully decorated with gains of corn to create teeth, horse hair for beards and deer horns to create images of the devil. Wax masks are made by molding the material to the wearers face directly.|$|E
2500|$|His work {{caught the}} {{attention}} of a gallery owner in Cuernavaca, in the south of Mexico and later, of artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. [...] In the 1980s, British filmmaker, Judith Bronowski, arranged an itinerant Mexican art craft demonstration workshop in the U.S.A. featuring Pedro Linares, Manuel Jiménez and a textile artisan Maria Sabina from Oaxaca. Although the Oaxaca valley area already had a history of carving animal and other types of figures from wood, it was at this time, when Bronowski's workshop took place, that artisans from Oaxaca learned of the alebrijes paper <b>mache</b> sculptures. Linares demonstrated his designs on family visits and which were adapted to the carving of a local wood called copal, this type of wood is said to be magical, made from unitado magic.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{materials}} used for masks include wax, fired clay, leather, cloth, wire mesh, sheet metal, rubber tires, cardboard and paper <b>mache.</b> Masks of wax {{are made in}} the Mexico City area, which perfectly fit the wearers face for a very realistic appearance. Other areas to use wax in this way include Villa de Zaachila, San Bartolo Coyotepec and Zapotec communities near the city of Oaxaca [...] These masks are made by molding the wax to the wearer’s own face. Tools used by wood mask makers include machetes, knives and blades, often fashioned by the craftsman himself. Other tools can include chisels, pliers and more with sandpaper or pumice stone for smoothing. Sometimes the masks are covered in plaster to achieve a smooth finish. Lacquer is used on masks in locations in Michoacán and Guerrero, where the technique is applied to a number of other items as well.|$|E
2500|$|He {{concentrated}} {{instead on}} Claponul, which he edited and wrote single-handedly {{for the duration}} of the war. Zarifopol believed that, through the series of light satires he contributed for the magazine, Caragiale was trying out his style, and thus [...] "entertaining the suburbanites, in order to study them". A piece he authored of the time featured an imaginary barber and amateur artist, Năstase Ştirbu, who drew a direct parallel between art, literature and cutting hair—both the theme and the character were to be reused in his later works. Similarly, a fragment of prose referring to two inseparable friends, Şotrocea and Motrocea, was to serve as the first draft for the Lache and <b>Mache</b> series in Momente şi schiţe. Another notable work of the time is Pohod la şosea, a rhyming reportage documenting the Russian Army's arrival to Bucharest, and the street reactions to the event. Claponul ceased publication in early 1878.|$|E
2500|$|Although few in number, Caragiale's plays {{constitute}} {{the most accomplished}} expression of Romanian theater, {{as well as being}} important venues for criticism of late 19th-century Romanian society. They include the comedies O noapte furtunoasă, Conu Leonida faţă cu reacţiunea, O scrisoare pierdută, and the tragedy Năpasta. In addition to these, Caragiale authored the melodrama O soacră, a large number of essays, articles, short stories, novellas and sketch stories, as well as occasional works of poetry and autobiographical texts such as Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur. In many cases, his creations were first published in one of several magazines he edited—Claponul, Moftul Român, Vatra and Epoca. Most of his prose works have been published under the title Momente şi schiţe: they include Căldură mare, Cănuţă om sucit, Două loturi, Grand Hotel [...] "Victoria română", as well as several pieces referring to stock characters such as Lache and <b>Mache,</b> Marius Chicoş Rostogan and Mitică. In some of his later fiction writings, including La hanul lui Mânjoală, Kir Ianulea, Abu-Hasan, Pastramă trufanda and Calul dracului, Caragiale adopted the fantasy genre or turned to historical fiction.|$|E
2500|$|The second, {{oldest and}} most {{important}} event is the [...] "pamplonada." [...] Named after the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Spain, these [...] "little bulls" [...] or [...] "toritos" [...] are also fireworks frames. These frames are made from wood, reed, hard paper <b>mache</b> (called cartonería), wire and more and painted bright colors. They can measure anywhere from fifty cm to over three meters in height costing between 400 and 20,000 pesos to make. The larger toritos are made by groups of thirty to forty people {{because of the cost}} and can have as many as 4,000 fireworks on them. The toritos are giving names such as El Chico, Sagitario Toro Maya and Monster. In the 2013 event, over 250 of these toritos were registered to participate. The toritos are paraded on March 8, in honor of John of God, the patron saint of fireworks makers. The toritos proceeds over the various streets of Tultepec, setting off their fireworks for five to six hours until they arrive to the main plaza of the town.|$|E
