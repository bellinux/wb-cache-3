500|$|In May 2007 Time {{magazine}} ran {{an article}} by James Poniewozik titled [...] "Is Shrek Bad for Kids?" [...] which considered the negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires, instead of the original stories. Poniewozik mentioned Hoodwinked! writing, [...] "I thought Hoodwinked! {{and most of the}} Shrek series were hilarious... But even if you ultimately reject their messages, old-school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary. There's something a little sad about kids growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre-satirized, the skepticism, critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood." [...] Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine, expressing his similar sentiments and writing, [...] "As the writer-director of Hoodwinked, it <b>may</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>you</b> that I couldn't agree more with James Poniewozik's article. Even as I was making the film, I asked myself the same question: Are we parodying something that kids should have the chance to experience first, 'un-parodied?' We {{went to great lengths to}} distance our film from Shreks humor (and no, I don't think Shrek considers kids). I would hope that Hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters, rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence. We ALL need the real folklore of fairytales, whether we admit it or not." ...|$|E

60|$|One other point, before I conclude, {{about this}} matter.

Geologists would be quite right in maintaining the seeming paradox that the stable thing in the world is the fluid sea and the shifting thing is the solid land. That may sound a very hard saying at first, but the more you look into geology, the more you will see ground for believing that it is not a mere paradox.|$|R
2500|$|Star Fox 2 {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} release {{as part of}} the Super NES Classic Edition. Eurogamer recommended the game as [...] "wonderfully surprising and inventive". Polygon described it as ambitious and fun. Nintendo World Report gave it 9/10 and wrote that it was [...] "arguably the most important game in the Star Fox series, and one of the greatest Super Nintendo games". Nintendo Life gave the game 8/10, writing: [...] "this 22-year-old relic is worth owning a SNES Mini for, and <b>may</b> well <b>surprise</b> <b>you</b> with its depth, complexity and challenge – so long as you're not expecting a straight sequel to the original." [...] Destructoid gave it 7/10, describing it as [...] "solid and definitely has an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun." [...] IGN gave it 5/10, complementing its [...] "janky-yet-plucky aesthetic", but complained that severe frame-rate drops plagued the game and that it was difficult to control the ships. They stated it was the worst game in the SNES Classic Edition and that, [...] "Looking back, it probably deserved to be cancelled".|$|R

Talent, Mr. Micawber has; capital, Mr. Micawber has not. We saw, I think, {{the greater part of}} the Medway; and that is my individual conclusion. Being so near here, Mr. Micawber was of opinion that it would be rash not to come on, and see the Cathedral.

40|$|This <b>may</b> not <b>surprise</b> <b>you,</b> {{but when}} I {{was a student}} of {{economics}} {{in the first half}} of the 1970 s, we were taught that economic growth over long periods was always and everywhere a technological phenomenon. The theory of economic growth at the time taught that the rate of growth of national economic output per person in the long run must be equal to the rate of technological progress, which was taken to be outside the purview of economics. So, economic growth was “exogenous ” – that is, it was not supposed to react to economic forces. I. Two Views of Growth The theory that traced long-run growth to technological advance and nearly nothing else was one of the most elegant economic theories of all time. It was beautiful, and still is. It earned its main founder, Robert Solow of MIT, a well-deserved Nobel Prize in 1987. But even so, the implication of the theory, as it was understood at the time, that long-run growth was solely a matter of technology was not fully satisfying. I for one came from a country where high inflation was creating havoc: Icelanders at the time were busy emptying their bank accounts in order to spare their money holdings from the ravages of double-digit inflation, so domestic saving plunged before our eyes. I was concerned that a collapse in national saving woul...|$|R

40|$|Have {{you ever}} {{wondered}} whether the popular method of computing amplifier power {{on the basis of}} dollars per watt was really meaningful? It has been accepted practice to think this way for so long that few of us challenge it. But {{with the advent of the}} super-power amplifiers, the time may have come to reconsider. What the super-amp buyer purchases, after all, is a number of extra decibels of headroom before clipping—the exact number of watts necessary being perhaps more a matter of the efficiency of his associated speaker system than of any other system char-acteristic. Thus it becomes appropriate to think, maybe, in terms of dollars per dB of headroom. Connecticut member Tom Mashey does some ground breaking for us along these lines in this month's issue, and at the same time evaluates many of the most popular amplifiers in terms of their $ /dB rating. Some of the results <b>may</b> <b>surprise</b> you; <b>you</b> <b>may</b> even consider a slightly lower powered amplifier if your speaker system has the necessary efficiency. Within the issue are notes on a variety of topics of interest to members: A modification to the Dynaco ST- 400 (developed by Dyna) that is said to improve its high-frequency performance— one of the few areas, according to many, where the Dynaco unit might be lacking; a word of timely advice for Sound Advice subscribers—don't miss this one if you hope to see another copy of th...|$|R
40|$|It is a {{privilege}} to be invited by this Association to address such a distinguished audience. Permit me to begin this afternoon by describing the nature and progress of my work at the Economic and Social Research Institute. As some of you know, I spent 1975 and 1976 at the Institute, doing research that in 1978 resulted in my paper on expenditures in education. I returned to the Institute last September, to undertake a project on health care expenditures. I have spent the time since September acquainting myself with the Irish health care system; acting {{as a consultant to}} the Oireachtais Joint Committee on state-Sponsored Bodies, on their study of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board; developing a report on "Poverty and Health" for the Irish Team, under the Institute of Public Administration, of a European Community study of poverty; and, as <b>may</b> not <b>surprise</b> <b>you,</b> trying to defend my paper on educational expenditures. Hence I have no results to report to you on health care expenditures. What I will have to say today is based on what is already generally known about the Irish system of health care, together with my understanding of health economics. I reserve the right to modify later the positions I take today. What kind of health care system do we need and want? I will offer the economists' answer: a system which is equitable in its treatment of persons, and efficient in its use of resources. As you will see, these terms are elastic enough to caver the preservation of health and life...|$|R

40|$|Highway 12 is {{undoubtedly}} one {{of not only}} America 2 ̆ 7 s but the world 2 ̆ 7 s most scenic highways. From its intersection on the west with Highway 89 south of Panguitch, Utah, it runs up through Red Canyon onto the Paunsagunt Plateau and across Bryce Canyon National Park. It then drops into the Paria River Valley, passes through several tiny villages, crosses some extraordinary (for anywhere but this region) badlands, and descends the Escalante River into Potato Valley. While a driver may justifiably feel she has seen some scenery by that point, the highway is just getting started, for in the next stretch, it crosses a labyrinth of multicolored sandstone humps and corridors, climaxed by a narrow hogback with steep slickrock drops to each side, all within Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Reaching the oasis of Boulder within this desert of rock, the road then climbs across the flank of the Aquarius Plateau, providing spectacular vistas and terminating at the gateway to Capitol Reef National Park. Along the way side roads and trails access the vast wilderness of the Paria and Escalante Rivers and the high plateaus they drain. Congress acknowledged the unequaled splendor of Highway 12 by designating it {{one of a handful}} of All-American Roads. To travel with Christian Probasco this road and its spurs, which lead deep into some of the wildest, most broken-up and stunning landscapes anywhere, can put a unique twist on an already singular experience.
