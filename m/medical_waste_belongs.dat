40|$|A {{large amount}} of <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> is {{produced}} during disaster relief, posing a potential hazard to the habitat and the environment. A comprehensive understanding of the composition and characteristics of <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> that requires management {{is one of the}} most basic steps in the development of a plan for <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> management. Unfortunately, limited reliable information is available in the open literature on the characteristics of the <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> that is generated at disaster relief sites. This paper discusses the analysis of the composition and characteristics of <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> at a disaster relief site using the retrospection-simulation-revision method. For this study, we obtained 35 medical relief records of the Wenchuan Earthquake, Sichuan, May 2008 from a field cabin hospital. We first present a retrospective analysis of the relief medical records, and then, we simulate the <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> generated in the affected areas. We ultimately determine the composition and characteristics of <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> in the affected areas using untreated <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> to revise the composition of the simulated <b>medical</b> <b>waste.</b> The results from 35 cases showed that the <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> generated from disaster relief consists of the following: plastic (43. 2 %), biomass (26. 3 %), synthetic fiber (15. 3 %), rubber (6. 6 %), liquid (6. 6 %), inorganic salts (0. 3 %) and metals (1. 7 %). The bulk density of <b>medical</b> relief <b>waste</b> is 249 kg/m 3, and the moisture content is 44. 75 %. The data should be provided to assist the collection, segregation, storage, transportation, disposal and contamination control of <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> in affected areas. In this paper, we wish to introduce this research method of restoring the <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> generated in disaster relief to readers and researchers. In addition, we hope more disaster relief agencies will become aware of the significance of medical case recording and storing. This may be very important for the environmental evaluation of <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> in disaster areas, as well as for <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> management and disposal...|$|R

No data about the prevalence of HBV among <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> handlers is available in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Therefore; this study was conducted to describe the prevalence of HBV infection among <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> handlers in Government hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Findings A cross sectional study was conducted among 252 <b>medical</b> and non-medical <b>waste</b> handlers working in three Government hospitals of Addis Ababa between May to July, 2010. Predesigned and tested questionnaire was used to collect soiociodemographic information. Blood sample was taken from 252 waste handlers and serum was tested for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-Hepatitis core antigen (anti-HBcAg) using Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay. Of the 126 <b>Medical</b> <b>Waste</b> Handlers and 126 Non <b>Medical</b> <b>Waste</b> Handler, HBsAg was detected in 8 (6. 3 %) and 1 (0. 8 %), and anti-HBcAg in 60 (47. 6 %) and 40 (31. 7 %), respectively. Significant differences were observed in the detection rates of HBsAg (OR: 8, 95 % CI: 1. 02, 63. 02; p = 0. 01), Anti-HB c Ag (OR: 1. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 1, 2. 1; p = 0. 01) and either markers (OR: 1. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 2, 2. 2; p = 0. 001) in <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> handlers compared to non <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> handlers. 19. 8 % were trained to handle <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> and none was immunized against HBV.

40|$|This thesis {{critically}} {{evaluates the}} policies, processes {{and practices of}} <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> management in selected rural hospitals in the Eastern Cape. <b>Medical</b> <b>Waste</b> Management is a growing public health and environmental issue worldwide. Research shows large scale incapacity in dealing with <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> in an efficient and sustainable fashion globally, which demonstrates {{that it is not}} merely a developing world problem alone. This study is conducted against the backdrop of an increasing <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> crisis in South Africa. Although there are an abundance of studies on solid waste management, {{there is a lack of}} data and research particularly on <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> management in rural hospitals. The crisis of <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> management in South Africa is closely intertwined with the collapsing health care system and an overburdened natural environment. It is an undisputable fact that South Africaâ€™s generation of <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> far exceeds its capacity to handle it effectively. This thesis argues that the neglect of <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> as an environmental-health issue and the absence of an integrated national <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> management plan aggravate the <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> problem in the country. In explaining the <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> crisis, this thesis adopts a Marxist perspective which is based on the premise that industrial capitalist societies place economic growth and production at high priority at the expense of the natural environment; creating a society that is engulfed by high health risk due to the generation of hazardous and toxic waste. Industrial societies view themselves as superior and separate from the natural environment, whereas one cannot separate nature from society as they are interlinked. As society attempts to adopt a sustainable environmental approach towards environmental management, science and technology are enforced as a solution to environmental problems in order to continue developing countriesâ€™ economies whilst sustainably managing and protecting the environment, which is contradictory. This thesis emphasises that <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> management is a socio-political problem as much as it is an environmental problem, hence the need to focus on power relations and issues of environmental and social justice. The results of the study identified gaps in policy framework nationally and institutionally on <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> management. In addition, there were poor waste management practices due to poor training, inadequate infrastructure and resources as well as poor budget support...|$|R

The developed model is designed to be an instrument to help with the best decision in <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> system management in Bandung. The best decision, which is the lowest cost implied to the patients, is intended to increase community health on the end. Model simulation applied in this research is using system dynamics method. The reason for using this method is to anticipate the dynamics of system complexity and the feedback to design a policy. The behaviour of the developed model is close to actual condition, so it can be used as decision making model of <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> management in Bandung. There is also indicated by the low value of RMSPE on stay-in-patients variable, which descend to 2. 61 %. Next from the model simulation can be predicted that the number of stay-in-patients is lesser, and so is the generation of <b>medical</b> <b>waste.</b> It is assumed that there is an increase in community health level in Bandung. From the simulation, we discovered that the best <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> management for Bandung city is integrated management. The cost for integrated <b>medical</b> <b>waste</b> management (3 th policy) is Rp 612 /kilogram, and the cost for one hospital is (1 st policy) is Rp. 3077 /kilogram and 2 nd policy is Rp. 2360 /kilogram.
