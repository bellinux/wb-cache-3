Different strategies {{have been developed for}} providing power to meet demand in each of these rural communities. Many of these communities rely on diesel electric generators (DEGs) for power. Some villages have also installed renewable power sources and automated generation systems for controlling the DEGs and other sources of power. For example, Lime Village has installed a diesel battery photovoltaic hybrid system, Kotzebue and Wales have wind-diesel hybrid systems, and McGrath has installed a highly automated system for controlling diesel generators. Poor power quality and diesel engine efficiency in village power systems increases the cost of <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>load.</b> Power quality problems may consist of poor power factor (PF) or waveform disturbances, while diesel engine efficiency depends primarily on loading, the fuel type, the engine temperature, and the use of waste heat for nearby buildings.

40|$|This paper studies an {{electricity}} market {{consisting of}} an independent system operator (ISO) {{and a group of}} generators. The goal is to solve the DC optimal power flow (DC-OPF) problem: have the generators collectively meet the power demand while minimizing the aggregate generation cost and respecting line flow limits in the network. The ISO by itself cannot solve the DC-OPF problem as generators are strategic and do not share their cost functions. Instead, each generator submits to the ISO a bid, consisting of the price per unit of electricity at which it is willing to provide power. Based on the bids, the ISO decides how much production to allocate to each generator to minimize the total payment while <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>load</b> and satisfying the line limits. We provide a provably correct, decentralized iterative scheme, termed BID ADJUSTMENT ALGORITHM, for the resulting Bertrand competition game. Regarding convergence, we show that the algorithm takes the generators' bids to any desired neighborhood of the efficient Nash equilibrium at a linear convergence rate. As a consequence, the optimal production of the generators converges to the optimizer of the DC-OPF problem. Regarding robustness, we show that the algorithm is robust to affine perturbations in the bid adjustment scheme and that there is no incentive for any individual generator to deviate from the algorithm by using an alternative bid update scheme. We also establish the algorithm robustness to collusion, i. e., we show that, as long as each bus with generation has a generator following the strategy, there is no incentive for any group of generators to share information with the intent of tricking the system to obtain a higher payoff.

The hydrogen production is sufficient to supply the current demand of the Great Lakes refineries. With today's electricity prices, a competitive production cost of $ 1. 5 /kg hydrogen is achievable. The analysis indicates large economic incentives to develop HTE systems that operate efficiently in reverse as fuel cells to displace the gas turbines that operate only a few hundred hours per year and thus have high capital cost charges. The capital cost of the HTE system has a significant impact on system economics, with large incentives to develop reversible HTE/ FC systems to reduce those costs.

40|$|Since {{the nineties}} decade, many {{electric}} utilities world-wide {{have been under}} restructuring from vertically integrated functioning to deregulated open-market system. In the erstwhile vertically integrated utilities, the system operator sought to maximize the social welfare with distributional equity (<b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> <b>load</b> at all time) as the main criteria, for {{the system as a}} whole. The operating paradigm was based on achieving the system solution while meeting reliability and security margins. This often led to investment in such generating capacity that operated at very low load factors. Decommissioning of generating capacity, particularly those operating at low load factors, is thus an expected outcome when such vertically integrated utilities moved over to deregulated market operations. The erstwhile objective of maximizing social welfare with distributional equity was then replaced by a profit-maximizing objective, which is nothing but maximizing social welfare with efficiency as the main criteria for the generating companies. As a consequence, power producers are not obliged to provide for the system reliability margin in deregulated markets. Additionally, new investments in generating capacity are not easily forthcoming since these are prerogative of private investors who look for a high internal rate of return on a project, and that becomes increasingly difficult to ensure in the competitive markets. The above mentioned problems associated with deregulation has triggered a need for the research and implementation of interruptible load management [...] ILM (which basically offers the much needed demand reduction during the system critical conditions within a short notice to avoid system security problem) in deregulated system operations. Though this concept is not new, but it has been well reasoned to use it now. Hence, this thesis. This thesis attempts to address importance of interruptible load management in deregulated power system operations based on both theoretical and practical backgrounds. The thesis has proposed a market structure for interruptible load customers where they can offer to sell part of their demand as part of the ancillary service market procured by the ISO.

Nevertheless, a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation technique is advocated to obtain a (relaxed) convex problem solvable in polynomial-time complexity. To promote a reliable yet efficient feeder operation, SDP-compliant constraints on line and neutral current magnitudes are accommodated in the optimization formulated, along with constraints on the power factor at the substation and at nodes equipped with capacitor banks.

Much existing research has addressed the voltage control problem by using distributed resources. Ye et al. apply energy storage systems for voltage regulation and peak load shaving [8]. Zeraati solves the voltage rise during the peak PV generation {{as well as the}} voltage drop while <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> peak <b>load</b> with battery energy storage systems [9]. Due to the high investment cost, batteries should be designed for multiple objectives to increase their economic feasibility. Distributed reactive power control methods for distributed generation (DG) have been proposed [10, 11, 12]. Reference [13] investigates the effectiveness and general performance of different reactive and active power control concepts. Coordinating DG with various voltage regulators is more effective than controlling DG alone; the interactions among DG units and voltage regulating devices are identified in [14]. Ranamuka proposed a control method to coordinate voltage regulators and DG for voltage support and demonstrated the performance [15]. However, limited by their operating constraints and ownership, most DGs are still uncontrollable for the system operator (DSO).|$|R

The US average CO2 emissions for a battery-electric car is 180 grams per mile vs 430 grams per mile for a gasoline car.
