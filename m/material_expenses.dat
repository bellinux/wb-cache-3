It was immediately refounded in the Congo Free State as the Abir Congo Company. The name was no longer an acronym of Anglo-Belgian India Rubber and was instead a name in its own right. This change was because the company was no longer supported by British investment, partly because Colonel North had died and his heirs had sold their shares. The new company had a simpler shares system with just 2,000 shares (of 14,300 fr value each) divided between investors. The Free State held 1,000 of these shares. As Abir was now tax resident in the Congo the Free State received 2% of their profits through corporation tax, in addition to the 0.5 fr per kilogram export tax. All initial capital investments had been amortised by 1899 along with <b>material</b> <b>expenses</b> in Africa and property and equipment expenses in Antwerp. In 1900 Abir reached the boundaries of its concession which covered eight million hectares. The next three years were spent filling gaps between existing posts and by 1903 Abir controlled 49 posts, managed by 58 agents. 1900 was Abir's most profitable year and the Congo Free State's shares and taxes provided 2,567,880.50 fr of revenue for the state, 10% of that year's total. The share dividend in 1900 was 2,100 fr, in the early 1890s it had been around 2 fr per share.|$|E

These unanticipated losses resulted in increases or surcharges to the stabilized rates as an offset. This project conducts a variance analysis to uncover possible causes of the unanticipated losses. The variance analysis between budgeted (projected) and actual financial results was performed on financial data collected on the E- 2 C aircraft program from Fleet Readiness Center Southwest (FRCSW) located in San Diego, California. The results of the variance analysis are interpreted and {{discussed in terms of}} labor sales quantity, mix, and rate variances, material sales variance, <b>material</b> <b>expense</b> variance, labor, production overhead, and general and administrative rate/spending and quantity variances. The results of this project reveal the factors that created the greatest variance in FRCSW's net operating results. The variance analysis suggests that the factors having the greatest affect on the operating results were the material sales variances, <b>material</b> <b>expense</b> variances, and the variances due to the quantity of work. Additionally, the analysis revealed that during the year analyzed (FY 2007) FRCSW was not reimbursed for 21 percent of its material costs...|$|R
