40|$|Abstract. The goal of {{this paper}} is to discuss {{statistical}} aspects of clustering in a framework where the data to be clustered has been sampled from some unknown probability distribution. Firstly, the clustering of the data set should reveal some structure of the underlying data rather than model artifacts due to the random sampling process. Secondly, the more sample points we have, the more reliable the clustering should be. We discuss which methods can and cannot be used to tackle those problems. In particular we argue that generalization bounds as they are used in statistical learning theory of classification are unsuitable in a general clustering framework. We suggest that the main replacements of generalization bounds should be convergence proofs and stability considerations. This paper should be considered as a road <b>map</b> <b>paper</b> which identifies important questions and potentially fruitful directions for future research about statistical clustering. We do not attempt to present a complete statistical theory of clustering. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Given the {{unreliable}} self-report {{in patients}} with dementia, pain assessment should also rely on the observation of pain behaviors, such as facial expressions. Ideal observers should be well trained and should observe the patient continuously in order to pick up any pain-indicative behavior; which are requisitions beyond realistic possibilities of pain care. Therefore, the need for video-based pain detection systems has been repeatedly voiced. Such systems would allow for constant monitoring of pain behaviors and thereby allow for a timely adjustment of pain management in these fragile patients, who are often undertreated for pain. Methods In this road <b>map</b> <b>paper</b> we describe an interdisciplinary approach to develop such a video-based pain detection system. The development starts with the selection of appropriate video material of people in pain {{as well as the}} development of technical methods to capture their faces. Furthermore, single facial motions are automatically extracted according to an international coding system. Computer algorithms are trained to detect the combination and timing of those motions, which are pain-indicative. Results/conclusion We hope to encourage colleagues to join forces and to inform end-users about an imminent solution of a pressing pain-care problem. For the near future, implementation of such systems can be foreseen to monitor immobile patients in intensive and postoperative care situations...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge {{of spatial}} {{patterns}} of biota {{has become a}} commodity for conservation practitioners and spatial ecologists alike. This type of information enables the identification of representative and unique biological features (at some nominal scale) which itself constitutes the application par excellence of knowledge of biodiversity distribution {{as it relates to}} the design of reserve networks and the realization of spatial planning. Furthermore, insight into the spatial distribution of the various components of biological diversity provides a way of addressing issues of fundamental ecology relating to the processes influencing the variation of ecosystem structure across space. The present thesis is concerned with methods (and related issues) to document the spatial distribution of diversity at the assemblage (or community) level, which is later proven to be an adequate surrogate for diversity patterns at the species level, and therefore an adequate approach for identifying sites representative of regional biodiversity. This was investigated across the benthic portion of a Marine National Park off the West coast of Sweden. At the center of this thesis is the production of a map of benthic biotopes by use of automated, objective methods, of measurable accuracy, and that can support marine spatial planning. In Papers I and II, I address various aspects related to the data model underpinning this <b>map.</b> <b>Paper</b> I deals with patterns of spatial patchiness of benthic communities, which helped determine the appropriate resolution at which epibenthic biological diversity in this area is best investigated. Here, spatial autocorrelation is measured at a range of scales and used to determine an appropriate grain size for subsequent sampling. This will become a backbone of this study, as it determines the (only) spatial scale for which the findings are relevant. In Paper II I assess the performance of classifications of communities at varying levels of compositional detail as a way of calibrating the classification scheme to be used as the basis for the <b>map.</b> <b>Paper</b> III is a case study of predictive mapping of communities. The process was driven by patterns of occurrence of benthic communities, which were then extrapolated using observed biota-environment relationships, by means of full-coverage variables derived from multibeam data. This approach draws heavily from the field of distribution modelling of species and/or communities. Further, I present a number of analysis techniques that are new to benthic ecology, and virtually new to predictive mapping in general (albeit not to the field of predictive, statistical modelling, and classification algorithms). In Paper IV I evaluate the applicability of the produced map of benthic biotopes as a tool for conservation planning. Particularly, I test the value of the outputs from the model introduced in Paper III (i. e., the biotopes with their associated spatial attributes) as conservation features, or surrogates for biodiversity, in the context of systematic conservation planning, to represent biodiversity at other hierarchical levels and across ecological niches...|$|E
40|$|Apoptosis is {{one type}} of {{programmed}} cell death, important during tissue development and to maintain the tissue homeostasis. Apoptosis comprises a complex network of internal signaling pathways, and {{an important part of}} this signaling network is the action of voltage‐gated ion channels. The aim of this thesis was to explore the role of ion channels and the role of intracellular metal ions during apoptosis in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The reasons for using these oocytes are that they are large, robust, easy to handle, and easy to study electrophysiologically. Apoptosis was induced either chemically by incubation of the oocytes in staurosporine (STS) or mechanically by centrifugation of the oocytes. Ion currents were measured by a two‐electrode voltage clamp technique, intracellular ion concentrations were measured either directly by in‐house developed K+‐selective microelectrodes or indirectly by the electrophysiological technique, and apoptosis was measured by caspase‐ 3 activation. Paper I describes that the intracellular K+ concentration was reduced by about 30 % during STS‐induced apoptosis. However, this reduction was prevented by excessive expression of exogenous ion channels. Despite the magnitude of the intracellular K+ concentration, either normal or reduced level, the oocytes displayed normal signs of apoptosis, suggesting that the intracellular K+ reduction was not required for the apoptotic process. Because the intracellular K+ concentration was not critical for apoptosis we searched for other ion fluxes by exploring the electrophysiological properties of X. laevis oocytes. Paper II, describes a non‐inactivating Na+ current activated at positive membrane voltages that was upregulated by a factor of five during STS‐induced apoptosis. By preventing influx of Na+, the apoptotic signaling network involving capsase‐ 3 was prevented. To molecularly identify this voltage‐gated Na channel, the X. tropicalis genome and conserved regions of the human SCNA genes were used as a <b>map.</b> <b>Paper</b> III, shows that the voltage‐gated Na channel corresponds to the SCN 2 A gene ortholog and that supression of this SCN 2 A ortholog using miRNA prevented cell death. In conclusion, this thesis work demonstrated that a voltage‐gated Na channel is critical for the apoptotic process in X. laevis oocytes by increasing the intracellular Na+ concentration...|$|E
40|$|POSTDATA is a 5 year's European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant Project {{that started}} in May 2016 and is hosted by the Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED), Madrid, Spain. The context of the project is the corpora of European Poetry (EP), with a special focus on poetic {{materials}} from different languages and literary traditions. POSTDATA aims to offer a standardized model in the philological field and a metadata application profile (MAP) for EP {{in order to build}} a common classification of all these poetic materials. The information of Spanish, Italian and French repertoires will be published in the Linked Open Data (LOD) ecosystem. Later we expect to extend the model to include additional corpora. There are a number of Web Based Information Systems in Europe with repertoires of poems available to human consumption but not in an appropriate condition to be accessible and reusable by the Semantic Web. These systems are not interoperable; they are in fact locked in their databases and proprietary software, not suitable to be linked in the Semantic Web. A way to make this data interoperable is to develop a MAP {{in order to be able}} to publish this data available in the LOD ecosystem, and also to publish new data that will be created and modeled based on this MAP. To create a common data model for EP is not simple since the existent data models are based on conceptualizations and terminology belonging to their own poetical traditions and each tradition has developed an idiosyncratic analytical terminology in a different and independent way for years. The result of this uncoordinated evolution is a set of varied terminologies to explain analogous metrical phenomena through the different poetic systems whose correspondences have been hardly studied – see examples in González-Blanco & Rodríguez (2014 a and b). This work has to be done by domain experts before the modeling actually starts. On the other hand, the development of a MAP is a complex task though it is imperative to follow a method for this development. The last years Curado Malta & Baptista (2012, 2013 a, 2013 b) have been studying the development of MAP's in a Design Science Research (DSR) methodological process in order to define a method for the development of MAPs (see Curado Malta (2014)). The output of this DSR process was a first version of a method for the development of Metadata Application Profiles (Me 4 <b>MAP)</b> (<b>paper</b> to be published). The DSR process is now in the validation phase of the Relevance Cycle to validate Me 4 MAP. The development of this MAP for poetry will follow the guidelines of Me 4 MAP and this development will be used to do the validation of Me 4 MAP. The final goal of the POSTDATA project is: i) to be able to publish all the data locked in the WIS, in LOD, where any agent interested will be able to build applications over the data in order to serve final users; ii) to build a Web platform where: a) researchers, students and other final users interested in EP will be able to access poems (and their analyses) of all databases; b) researchers, students and other final users will be able to upload poems, the digitalized images of manuscripts, and fill in the information concerning the analysis of the poem, collaboratively contributing to a LOD dataset of poetry.

40|$|Multitemporal SAR {{images have}} been {{increasingly}} {{used for the}} detection of different types of environmental changes. The detection of urban changes using SAR images is complicated due to the complex mixture of the urban environment and the special characteristics of SAR images, for example, the existence of speckle. This thesis investigates urban change detection using multitemporal SAR images with the following specific objectives: (1) to investigate unsupervised change detection, (2) to investigate effective methods for reduction of the speckle effect in change detection, (3) to investigate spatio-contextual change detection, (4) to investigate object-based unsupervised change detection, and (5) to investigate a new technique for object-based change image generation. Beijing and Shanghai, the largest cities in China, were selected as study areas. Multitemporal SAR images acquired by ERS- 2 SAR and ENVISAT ASAR sensors were used for pixel-based change detection. For the object-based approaches, TerraSAR-X images were used. In Paper I, the unsupervised detection of urban change was investigated using the Kittler-Illingworth algorithm. A modified ratio operator that combines positive and negative changes was used to construct the change image. Four density function models were tested and compared. Among them, the log-normal and Nakagami ratio models achieved the best results. Despite the good performance of the algorithm, the obtained results suffer from the loss of fine geometric detail in general. This was a consequence of the use of local adaptive filters for speckle suppression. Paper II addresses this problem using the nonlocal means (NLM) denoising algorithm for speckle suppression and detail preservation. In this algorithm, denoising was achieved through a moving weighted average. The weights are a function of the similarity of small image patches defined around each pixel in the image. To decrease the computational complexity, principle component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the neighbourhood feature vectors. Simple methods to estimate the number of significant PCA components to be retained for weights computation and the required noise variance were proposed. The experimental results showed that the NLM algorithm successfully suppressed speckle effects, while preserving fine geometric detail in the scene. The analysis also indicates that filtering the change image instead of the individual SAR images was effective in terms {{of the quality of the}} results and the time needed to carry out the computation. The Markov random field (MRF) change detection algorithm showed limited capacity to simultaneously maintain fine geometric detail in urban areas and combat the effect of speckle. To overcome this problem, Paper III utilizes the NLM theory to define a nonlocal constraint on pixels class-labels. The iterated conditional mode (ICM) scheme for the optimization of the MRF criterion function is extended to include a new step that maximizes the nonlocal probability model. Compared with the traditional MRF algorithm, the experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm was superior in preserving fine structural detail, effective in reducing the effect of speckle, less sensitive to the value of the contextual parameter, and less affected by the quality of the initial change <b>map.</b> <b>Paper</b> IV investigates object-based unsupervised change detection using very high resolution TerraSAR-X images over urban areas. Three algorithms, i. e., Kittler-Illingworth, Otsu, and outlier detection, were tested and compared. The multitemporal images were segmented using multidate segmentation strategy. The analysis reveals that the three algorithms achieved similar accuracies. The achieved accuracies were very close to the maximum possible, given the modified ratio image as an input. This maximum, however, was not very high. This was attributed, partially, to the low capacity of the modified ratio image to accentuate the difference between changed and unchanged areas. Consequently, Paper V proposes a new object-based change image generation technique. The strong intensity variations associated with high resolution and speckle effects render object mean intensity unreliable feature. The modified ratio image is, therefore, less efficient in emphasizing the contrast between the classes. An alternative representation of the change data was proposed. To measure the intensity of change at the object in isolation of disturbances caused by strong intensity variations and speckle effects, two techniques based on the Fourier transform and the Wavelet transform of the change signal were developed. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the result show that improved change detection accuracies can be obtained by classifying the proposed change variables.   QC 20150529 </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Since Taiwan {{is located}} on a global shell, {{mountain}} areas and faults usually form dipslope topography. After {{the bank of the}} valley is eroded, earthquakes and heavy rainfall can easily cause mass wasting and huge disasters. The Tsau-Lin landslide was one typical and complete case. Of all the landslides, the hundred year frequency “ 9 / 21 ” earthquake in 1999 in Taiwan caused dramatic collapse and landslide dams. It has attracted attention from all over the world. Fortunately, the “ 7 / 2 Flood” in 2004 relieved the potential dangers. This study focuses on the history of Tsau-Lin dipslope with repeated wasting and geomorphologic change after 9 / 21 earthquake using aerophotography and remote sensing, global positioning system, geographic information system and technology overlay analysis. According to the increase of soil, water and sand accumulation of mass wasting, we are able to estimate longterm speed of slope and riverbed erosion and understand the mechanism and trend of the collapse. Utilizing the yearly graphic information, we can correctly provide an effective analysis and research of geomorphologic evolution. Based on geologic uniform variation theory, we can research the dramatic change process of the Tsau-Lin area before and after 9 / 21 earthquake. Through collecting information about different geomorphologic evolutions, we are capable of applying these to prevent further diasters. The results and findings are as following: 1. 	Shale and sand inter-bedding dipslope usually cause the most dramatic land movement and the fastest collapse. Since Taiwan's land is still young, it will cause frequent shell movement. This research uses single GPS control point to form Tsau-Ling area DEM(digital elevation model) information. The clarity of the result can fit in the need of huge landslide and collapse analysis. According to the DEM, the geomorphologic sensitive zone under frequent storms and earthquakes, the collapses represent certain evolution rules. 2. 	This study makes use of various historical information of Tsau-Lin mass wasting, satellite observation and geographical system to establish a complete process flowchart. It controls and monitors the characteristics of the dipslope topography, foretelling the possible future land changes and provides decision supporting of disaster prevention for the government. 3. In order to realize the historical changes of mass wasting lnad in the Tsau-Lin area, we use <b>map,</b> <b>paper</b> map, Japan occupied stage and topographic maps. After digitized satellite DEM analysis and comparison, it is easy to understand the land change through calculation geographical information system. 4. Tsau-Lin area's huge landslide caused by storms and earthquakes can be described by the cycle evolution process as following: 5. 	The slope change of Tsau-Lin area, according to the recent five years' analysis and comparison, the reason of the collapse was still mainly controlled by the land type rather than the stormy type mass wasting. 6. 	After the 9 / 21 Tsau-Lin landslide, the government's effect of applying disaster support toward natural land changes was limited. This research utilizes satellite observations and global geographical information systems to establish standard models and process flowcharts in order to provide as emergency process for the possibility of future landslides. 摘 要 台灣島係由歐亞大陸板塊與菲律賓海板塊擠壓隆起而成，因地殼變動劇烈，使以沉積岩為主要地層之台灣島發生褶皺與斷層而常形成順向坡地形，在河岸基脚不斷被淘刷而形成自由端後，每遇地震與豪雨即生大規模之崩塌並造成災害，草嶺山崩乃一典型且資料完整之案例。尤其於 1999 年發生百年頻率之九二一大地震時草嶺再次發生大規模崩塌並造成堰塞湖， 2004 年之七二洪水已將其沖散而化解了其潛在危險。 本研究即針對草嶺順向坡之地形發生一崩再崩之歷史與九二一大地震後地形之演變，以航遙測影像，透過全球定位系統(GPS) 之輔助及地理資訊系統(GIS) 技術所建立歷年較精確而完整之系列圖資成果，藉套疊分析歷次崩塌之土石方量、堰塞湖蓄水量、泥砂量及其消長情形，以估計長年以來之邊坡及河道沖蝕速率，並瞭解其崩塌之機制與趨勢，將所獲得歷年完整之圖資，據以提供較精確及高效率之地形演化分析與研究。以地質均變學說及地形演化理論為基礎，詳細探究九二一大地震前後草嶺地區劇變之過程，進而推求歷次崩塌之地形演化相關資訊，以鑑往知來並供防災應用。茲述其主要成果如後： 一、	本研究獨採「以單一組GPS控制點推算產製之歷年各期DEM資料」，其精度符合地形分析之需求，所建立之地形演化相關圖資，可精確瞭解台灣地形之演變，除從簡要地圖、紙圖、或以日據時代所建立之台灣早期地形圖經數化後，與現今由航測製圖產生之DEM進行套疊分析比對，可輕易地瞭解地形之演變，且藉由GIS之相關功能即可進行快速分析及量化計算。 二、	台灣之山地常受地震及豪雨侵襲，於造成大山崩後其自然地形之輪廻演替之演變過程可以下式進行描述： 式中以 之後退係數b為地形演化之主要控制因素，由本研究所建立草嶺地區近百年來連續崩塌之資料，分析結果顯示砂頁岩互層之順向坡崩塌的大量土砂移動，係地形演化之主因。 三、	具砂頁岩互層地層之順向坡地形，其崩塌速率及其規模較大，常係地表活動中土砂移動最劇烈並常造成災害者，由於台灣地質年代輕、地殼活動仍然相當頻繁，且在豪雨及地震不斷的條件下，對砂頁岩互層且敏感之順向坡地形區之崩塌現象，本研究分析並獲得其演化之定則為：(一) 草嶺大崩塌 自 1999 年因九二一大地震崩塌後其崩塌坡面之變化，經五年來逐年分析比對之結果，其崩塌特性主要仍受具砂頁岩互層地層之特性所左右。(二) 自 1903 ~ 2004 年約百年間由於主要豪雨及地震兩種作用外力之特性不同，呈現不同之崩塌規模：豪雨型崩塌之規模較小且只有局部地層崩裂滑動；地震型崩塌則為整層崩解。 四、	九二一大地震草嶺發生大崩塌後政府及各方所採行之各項措施，由於對自然地形變遷之資訊未能全然掌握而採取更完妥之做法。本研究由所蒐集完整之崩塌歷史資料及史料記載，以航遙測、GPS及GIS等科技深入探討及分析其相關地形變遷之過程，可充分掌握順向坡之地質與地形演變之特性並預測未來地形之劇烈演變，且已建立其完整之作業模式及處理流程，其結果與經驗可提供政府往後在有類似大型崩塌發生或在山坡地發生土石災害時之防救災決策支援上應採何種因應處理之參考。目 錄 目 錄	I 表目錄	VI 圖目錄	VIII 第一章 緒論	 1 1. 1 研究緣起	 1 1. 2 研究動機與目的	 2 1. 3 研究構想與步驟	 3 1. 4 研究流程	 4 第二章 文獻回顧	 6 2. 1 地形演變與地質災害	 6 2. 1. 1 地質及土砂災害	 7 2. 1. 2 坡面崩塌及山崩分類	 9 2. 1. 3 順向坡砂頁岩互層之滑動特性	 13 2. 1. 4 山崩規模及崩塌體積之估算	 18 2. 1. 5 地形演變主要因素	 19 2. 2 大型順向坡崩塌案例探討	 20 2. 2. 1 國外案例	 20 2. 2. 2 台灣案例分析	 22 2. 2. 3 順向坡大型崩塌特性	 29 2. 3 豪雨及地震與地形變遷之關係	 30 2. 3. 1 極端降水對地表之衝擊	 30 2. 3. 2 草嶺地區上游集水區之降雨與逕流	 32 2. 3. 3 地震與坡地崩塌	 33 2. 4 航遙測於地形變遷之監測與應用	 35 2. 4. 1 航空攝影測量之發展與應用	 35 2. 4. 2 數值地形模型(digital terrain model,DTM) 之產製及其應用	 37 2. 4. 3 數值地形模型(DTM) 應用之相關研究	 41 2. 4. 4 多期影像判釋及其分析	 42 2. 4. 5 遙控無人載具拍攝影像	 43 2. 4. 6 衛星遙測於崩塌地判釋及變遷之應用	 46 2. 5 航遙測於坡地減災之應用與發展	 47 2. 5. 1 航照圖之應用	 49 2. 5. 2 航空照片之特性	 49 2. 5. 3 LIDAR影像	 51 2. 6 整合GIS、GPS、RS於災害防救之應用	 51 2. 6. 1 GIS於防災之應用	 51 2. 6. 2 遙感探測及變遷分析之應用	 52 2. 6. 3 GIS、GPS、RS之整合應用	 54 第三章 草嶺山崩歷史及其特性	 56 3. 1 前言	 56 3. 1. 1 區域及位置概述	 57 3. 1. 2 草嶺地區集水區概述	 59 3. 2 地質及地形	 60 3. 2. 1 岩層與地質構造	 60 3. 2. 2 地形	 71 3. 3 草嶺山崩歷程整理	 73 3. 3. 1 第一次崩塌 1862 年	 74 3. 3. 2 第二次崩塌	 77 3. 3. 3 第三次崩塌	 81 3. 3. 4 第四次崩塌	 85 3. 4 山崩及堰塞湖潰決原因分析探討	 87 3. 4. 1 草嶺地區之地震	 87 3. 4. 2 草嶺地區豪雨	 88 3. 4. 3 崩塌的原因	 92 第四章 研究材料與方法	 95 4. 1 研究材料	 95 4. 1. 1 早期地形圖	 95 4. 1. 2 數值高程模型	 98 4. 1. 3 航空照片及航照數位影像	 98 4. 1. 4 衛星影像	 98 4. 1. 5 水文泥砂及地震資料	 101 4. 1. 6 軟硬體	 102 4. 2 研究方法	 103 4. 2. 1 主要研究流程及方法	 103 4. 2. 2 九二一地震大山崩之航拍緊急處理過程	 104 4. 2. 3 GPS精密量測控制點後之各期航拍製圖	 108 4. 2. 4 推估 1941 年及 1942 年崩塌區界之流程	 110 4. 2. 5 數化崩塌區河道線及深槽線	 111 4. 2. 6 正射影像及DEM之套疊分析	 111 4. 2. 7 水圖層套疊分析	 113 4. 2. 8 崩塌堆積高度、土方量及堰塞湖溢流高程之驗證	 115 4. 3 航遙測數值資料之套疊分析理論	 115 4. 3. 1 套疊分析基本理論	 116 4. 3. 2 衛星影像之處理與變遷分析	 119 4. 4 地形演化理論推導	 123 4. 4. 1 地形演化理論簡介	 123 4. 4. 2 草嶺順向坡崩塌斷面與斜面後退之套合	 130 第五章 結果與討論	 132 5. 1 數位航遙測資料之建立與精度檢核	 132 5. 1. 1 九二一地震災害緊急航測製圖及成果應用	 132 5. 1. 2 以GPS精密量測控制點後之各期航拍製圖	 143 5. 1. 3 航測資料精度檢核	 143 5. 1. 4 衛星影像遙測資料之建置及處理	 149 5. 1. 5 斷面及剖面線比較分析	 155 5. 1. 6 地形分析	 157 5. 1. 7 航測照片之陰影及其誤差之討論	 159 5. 1. 8 早期地形圖及簡圖之應用	 160 5. 2 崩塌區地形演化分析結果與討論	 166 5. 2. 1 歷次崩塌範圍及規模	 166 5. 2. 2 崩塌區歷次崩塌之坡面變化	 169 5. 2. 3 崩塌區坡面表層沖蝕	 170 5. 2. 4 草嶺山崩歷次崩積量分析	 174 5. 2. 5 崩塌區坡面植生恢復	 179 5. 3 堰塞湖之蓄水及泥砂淤積探討	 180 5. 3. 1 堰塞湖歷次蓄水量檢測	 181 5. 3. 2 、 2002 年與 2003 年堰塞湖之泥砂量比較	 186 5. 3. 3 歷次堰塞湖潰決後庫容泥砂量檢測	 187 5. 3. 4 堰塞湖與水資源利用	 189 5. 4 上游崩塌區與泥沙產出量之關係探討	 190 5. 4. 1 上游崩塌區面積與潛在來砂量估計	 191 5. 4. 2 上游崩塌區位與堰塞湖土砂淤積關係之探討	 193 5. 4. 3 草嶺崩塌地上下游河道變遷	 198 5. 5 泥沙量估算與地形演化之驗證	 205 5. 5. 1 地震前後集水區泥沙量推估	 205 5. 5. 2 草嶺 1888 年曾再度崩塌形成堰塞湖之驗證	 207 5. 5. 3 草嶺殘坡崩塌之預測	 208 5. 6 順向坡地形演化之論證	 208 5. 6. 1 地表沖蝕量	 209 5. 6. 2 草嶺順向坡地形演化公式之論證	 210 第六章 結論與建議	 216 6. 1 結論	 216 6. 2 建議	 218 參考文獻	 220 附録一、各種附圖(1 -

The geological heritage {{is an essential part of}} the cultural heritage of a territory and it needs land planning, conservation, valorisation and dissemination. In the context of sustainable development, different forms of "thematic" tourism have grown in recent years, including the geotourism. The scientific community is increasingly involved in the economic development of the territory, through the research on geological heritage too. Different aspects are being studied: -the analysis of the territory for the recognition of geological aspects of scientific interest; -their evaluation; -the analysis of the risks to which they are subject and the conservation strategies; -the strategies for the use of the sites, the understanding of scientific aspects by users and tools for the mediation of knowledges. Aim of the research Through the scientific literature and the direct knowledge of an area it is possible to understand the geological heritage value, depending on its conservation and enhancement. For this reason institutions, public and private structures involved in land management often address to the universities and to the research to develop territories potential through the use of geo-environmental information, education, dissemination and sustainable management of the landscape. The aim of this thesis was to prepare a methodological procedure for the geoheritage enhancement, that defines the steps for the analysis of an area, beginning from the geomorphological survey to the creation and dissemination of instruments to popularize the geological heritage. The procedure has been developed starting from pure research, but aimed to its direct application as a guideline for the institutions and structures mentioned above. Study areas The development of the methodological procedure is supported by verifying its functionality through the application on two areas. A natural area, the mountain range of Monti Ernici (Southern Lazio) of known geomorphological interest and of interesting cultural aspects related to karst phenomenon; and an urbanized area, the city of Rome, characterized by the enormous knowledge accumulated in bibliography and the great potential of its geological and cultural heritage. The application of the method involved the geomorphological survey of the areas and the production of thematic cartography. Were inventoried and evaluated the geosites and geomorphosites characterizing the two territories and their data were organized in a relational database, functional to the processing for the automathic choice of geotourist trails. For each area was developed an enhancement proposal. This PhD thesis presents the research work describing it in three parts and an appendix. Part I The first part develops in three chapters introducing the context in which the work fits in. In Chapter 1, summarizing the remarkable bibliography consulted, are introduced the terms of geological heritage and the definitions adopted among the various developed in the history of this kind of studies. In particular geological goods are described as part of the cultural heritage and the definition of geosite is explained through its historical evolution (Strasser et al., 1995; Grandgirard, 1997, 1999; Wimbledon et al., 1999), its increasing specificity depending on the fields of application (Panizza & Piacente, 1999, 2003; Panizza, 2001) and through the definition of descriptive attributes of the quality of a geological site (Reynard, 2004, 2005). Some important concept are introduced such as geodiversity and geoconservation, and the application concepts of “geodiffusione” (spreading geological knowledges, Piacente, 2003) and geotourism (Hose, 1995, 2000; Newsome & Dowling, 2010; Gray, 2011; Arouca Declaration, 2011). The Chapter 2 is a retrospective of the projects, the research and the legislation about geological heritage, starting from the understanding of the need to safeguard geodiversity such as biodiversity. This excursus is a pan of the national and international initiatives. It is highlight the importance of Geoparks initiative, under the auspices of UNESCO, and the Italian Geological Service's role in launching the national-level projects. Particular attention was paid to the state of the art in the Latium region, to mark the starting point of the work on the study areas. The Latium regional geosites inventory was arranged by the Regional Park Agency-ARP (Cresta et al., 2005), in the context of initiatives undertaken by the Geological Survey, in collaboration with it and with the Latium Region. The ARP provided the geosites evaluation too, developing an evaluation model that indexes the Intrinsic Value of Sites of Geological Interest (VISIG). This index allows to give a priority order to the protection and preservation of geosites. The Regional Park Agency also contributed to the promulgation of regional laws for the geosites protection (D. G. R. Lazio 859 / 09). In the Chapter 3 are described the interventions of the research on geological heritage, in particular the axis on which the studies develop (evaluation, protection, popularization) and the problems they face. The first paragraph introduce the results of international and national research on the evaluation models of geological heritage goods. There are different models depending on the purpose of the evaluations, which can be summed up in three kinds: awareness and conservation of geosites (Panizza & Piacente, 1993; Serrano & Gonzales Trueba, 2005; Pereira et al., 2007; Fattori & Mancinella, 2010; Coratza et al., 2012), environmental impact assessments (Rivas et al., 1997; Coratza & Giusti, 2005; Bruschi & Cendrero, 2005), education and/or local development through thematic tourism (Reynard, 2007; Bollati, 2012). The same type of description is made of the tools developed for the protection, legislation and management of geosites, which concerns the administration of the territory. Management is also the issue of the vulnerability of the sites, exposed to flows of visitors, but also the vulnerability of the visitors in the presence of active geosites and, in particular, active geomorphosites (Reynard, 2004). Finally, are described the geo-heritage enhancement strategies on which the majority of studies concentrate: geotourist trails planning (Coratza et al., 2004; The Via Geoalpina VVAA, 2010; Del Monte et al., 2013; Magagna et al., 2013) virtual and non-virtual ones, static mapping (Carton et al., 2005; Castaldini, 2005; Coratza & Regolini-Bissig, 2009; Regolini-Bissig & Reynard, 2010 and bibliography inside; Regolini, 2012) and dynamic (Ghiraldi et al., 2009, 2010), the preparation of informational supports, panels, guides and smartphones applications (Small, 2005; Qiu & Hubble, 2012 e bibliography inside; Magagna et al., 2010; divulgando. eu), methods for the scientific information interpretation (Cayla, 2009; Dowling, 2010; Calonge, 2010; Cardozo Moreira, 2012) and in conclusion the evaluation of the efficacy of these products (Sellier, 2009; Martin et al., 2010). The chapter closes by raising issues like the need for a uniform methodology of analysis, the disclosure of evaluations and the need to use the environmental interpretation, particularly in the geotourist cartography. Part II In this part of the thesis are shown the purpose of the work, the methods chosen to built the enhancement procedure and the integrations improved on the methods, to optimize the purposes. The Part II develops in two chapters in which it deals with the revision of several existing methods for the inventory, evaluation and enhancement of the geological heritage (methods chapter). The other chapter (materials chapter) describes the instruments chosen for enhancement and summarize the work in the proposal for a methodology that allows to start from the territory to get to its usability in geotourist terms. The chapter 4 refers to methods consulted for each step of the analysis and geotourist enhancement of an area, then arousing the interest on the integretions. Bibliographic consultation, for example, based on scientific publications, is complemented by tourist and popularization ones, such as data about the historical-archaeological heritage. This informations are needed for the enhancement of cultural landscapes in which the geosites are inserted. Among the methods for the analysis and the representation of the areas there are the geomorphological survey and mapping. In the paragraph related to the materials of enhancement the geotourist mapping methods are described and the proposal of a model for geotourist map legend. The selection and integrations of the inventory and evaluation methods constitute the fundamental element of the chapter. The methods have been analyzed and dismantled in their parts to build a new inventory and evaluation card: it contains informations open to every kind of reader and it shows the significance of a site for geotourism. The card is based on two models: the geosite inventory card by ISPRA (Italian insitute for Environmental Protection and Research, isprambiente. it) and the geosite evaluation model proposed by the ARP (Latium Regional Park Agency; Fattori & Mancinella, 2010). The integrations to this methods are described below. Geosite inventory card: •	the information given is useful and essential (the document is simple, easy to read and it uses a non-specialist language); •	the iconographic and representative aspects of the geological site are widely highlighted (images, maps, explanatory schemes of genetic processes); •	the scientific description is in non-specialist terms and it is based on the interpretation of scientific language (Ham, 1984); •	in the card are described scientific interests of the site and additional (contextual) too; •	the informations given are useful for the approach to the site (land use, conservation status, guidance on usability and accessibility). Geosite evaluation card: The use of a site of geological interest for economic development through geotourism need to evaluate different aspect of a geosite. Among the several attributes which could be quantified, can't miss the attributes summarized in the new index proposed in this thesis, the Value of a Site for Geotourism (VSG) index: VSG= RP+RR+SCE+SAC+AC the attributes are representativeness (RP), rarity (RR), scenic value (SCE), historical-cultural-archeological value (SAC) and accessibility (AC). The card allows to confer a value to each attribute identifing the characteristics of the geosite and recognizing them in the descriptions in the card. Each description try to remove the subjectivity of the selection and confers a value to the analysis of the geosite characteristics. The integrations to the base model lie in: •	some aspects included in representativeness (RP) evaluation has been redefined; the relationship between frequency of a geological aspect and the geographical setting of analysis is a new proposal for rarity (RR) evaluation; sub-attributes describing the scenic value (SCE) of a site are integrated from other models (Reynard et al, 2007; Ghiraldi, 2011) and “peculiarity of the forms” has been introduced as a new characteristic; the evaluation of historical, archaeological and cultural value (SAC) of the site has been included in the geosite evaluetion; the difficulty to reach a site and the presence of nearby services are the sub-attributes for the accessibility (AC); •	the card has been reviewed in order to make possible to understand the evaluation of a geological good to "non-specialists" users. •	finally, when compared to other evaluation models, the Value of a Site for Geoturism doesn’t present weights of the attributes. Infact, scientific attributes of the geosite are as important as additional ones, as the definition of geotourism wants (Arouca Declaration, 2011). The chapter 5 describes the materials of this research, consisting of geoturist enhancement tools. Chief among these a relational database in G. I. S. environment, for storage, management and analysis of all data (results of the survey, the geosite inventory and evaluation, network of touristic attractors of the analyzed areas, etc.). The geographical characterization of geomorphosites (forms present in geographic space, which are mapped and spatially georeferenced), linked to a number of attributes, makes them ideal objects to be managed by G. I. S systems. The database consists of 3 types of data: raster files, vector files, tables. The tables are structured on the basis of the assessment model of the VSG. Using the potential of relational database (connections between tables with one-to-one relationships and many to one and/or query formulation) it is possible to get the selection of geosites that respond to specific needs (Gregori & Melelli, 2005). The geographic properties of the data (georeferencing) also allows to create connection paths between sites, which take into account additional features such as usability or accessibility (geotourist itineraries). This is the procedure used to develop geoturist itineraries, described in the paragraph dedicated to enhancement tools. It is shown how to set a query, from the choice of a set of specific requirments for the itinerary: -choosing data from query -joining tables -queries of type ‘select by attributes [...] . ' and ' select by location [...] . '. Geosites with requested attributes and the closest traces (paths or roads) are selected in this way and joined to build the itinerary. The popularization of the geotourist itinerary consists in the description by stops, which is combined to the geoturist map. The problems of geoturist mapping (Regolini, 2012) are analyzed in this chapter to propose simplifications, changes and integrations of a geomorphologic map used to develop a the geoturist one. In particular, integrations include: the theme of the map, the base, the scale, the legend and the geo-morphological symbology. Each map product in this thesis is the synthesis of digital georeferenced data, which constitute the G. I. S environment relational database. The data stored in the database will appear as a paper geoturist map or as digital frame, via a web-gis that works on computerized platforms with a user-friendly interface. At the moment, the work still lack of the web-GIS implementation and interface. The last paragraph of chapter 5 summarizes in a flowchart the procedure proposed for the geoturist enhancement of an area, which may have application as a guideline for the institutions and public and private structures involved in the management and development of the territory. Part III The last part of the thesis is divided into three chapters, focusing on the areas of application of the methodology proposed. The chapter 6 briefly describes the landscapes of the Lazio region and places Rome and the Ernici Mountains within their variety, reflecting the distribution of the litostructural units and hence the regional geo-diversity. It also mentions the tourism dynamics in Lazio and the fusion of natural and cultural aspects of the territories represented in the selected areas. It gives an added value for Lazio classic tourism. The chapter 7 introduce the geographical and geological framework of Rome, followed by a description of the geomorphologic detection. Rome has been the subject of numerous studies, some of which about geomorphological setting (Bellotti et al., 1997, Della Seta & Del Monte, 2006; Ascani et al., 2008; Del Monte et al., 2013). Data avalaible in bibliography are not homogeneous, beacause of the different subjects and objectives of the studies. The analysis of different aspects did’nt include the geomorphological survey and the description of results, traditionally structured in the genetic classification of forms and data representation on a geomorphological map. For this reason, the geomorphological survey was conducted, at 1 : 10, 000 scale and produced the geomorphologic map of Rome. The geosite inventory was supported by this analysis and the geomorphological map is the basis for the geoturist map. The geosites inventory allowed to add two new geosites (geomorphosites) to the regional inventory: the Tiberina Island, a fluvial bar arosed where the Velabrum Maius merge into the Tevere counter flow and with an almost flat confluence angle; and the Testaccio Mount, an example of human morphogenesis, with its 48 m s. l. m. consisting of testae, broken Roman amphoras. The VSG (Value of a Site for Geotourism) of these geomorphosites, and the geosite reported by ARP (Regional Park Agency), has been evaluated. The results data, stored in ESRI ArcMap ® (ArcGIS software), were interrogated through specific queries, selecting the geosites of " mid-high VSG, linked to historical and archaeological aspects of high importance and quoting Roman legends or traditions, with high scenic value (SCE attribute) due to grandeur and presence of naturality colors ". Queries are the translation of this sentence. The enhancement proposal of the area consists of a geotourist itinerary, developed linking the selected geosites. The geotourist map includes the itinerary description with suggested stops of natural and cultural interests. Text and diagrams allow the scientific explanation of geological and geomorphological aspects and refer to historical-archeological ones (Coarelli, 2001; Insolera, 2001; Puliga & Panichi, 2009; Touring Club Italiano, 1999). The structure of chapter 8 is the same of the previous one: Ernici Mountains geographical and geological framework, geomorphological survey, geosites inventory and evaluation, enhancement. The literature about geomorphological setting of this area is very lacking. The mountain chain extension is about 550 km 2, this wide area demanded the choice of two sub-areas representative of the morphological aspects, on which concentrate the 1 : 10, 000 scale geomorphologic survey. An area includes Lazio and Abruzzi slopes of Viglio Mount and the ridges towards Campo Catino, including the homonimous hollow; the second sub-area insists on the Fiume river valley, Trisulti of Collepardo, including the foothills of the Rotonaria and Monna Mountains. The geosites inventory for these areas has identified three new geomorphosites unreported in regional inventory: the Viglio Mount wreck glacial cirque, fine example of the last glacial maximum glacialism forms on the Lazio-Abruzzi Apennines; the Madonna delle Cese (Our Lady of Meadows) Cave, a karst open cave that now houses a chapel; and the Arch in the rock of Trisulti, the wreck of a pressured karstic pipe of an ancient karstic underground grid. The superficial streaming reached and intruded by erosion the underground one, so nowadays the Fiume river flows thorugh the ancient pipe track. The VSG (Value of a Site for Geotourism) of these geomorphosites, and the geosite reported by ARP (Regional Park Agency), has been evaluated. The procedure of automatic selection of sites to develop the geotourist itinerary was not applied, because of the geographical separation of the two sub-areas and the related difficulty to develop an itinerary connecting them. The enhancement proposal of the Ernici Mounts consits of the geoturist <b>map</b> (<b>paper)</b> of the Rotonaria Mount-Trisulti of Collepardo sub-area, which includes a geoturist itinerary described by stops, schematic scientific aspects explanation and images. The itinerary tells about the cultural landscape (Sauer, 1925; Andreotti, 1998, 2008; Unesco, 2005) of the area, through Karst, hermitages and spirituality. Appendix Appendix is about the formative experience at the Adamello Brenta Nature Park, Geopark of the European UNESCO Network. The experience was a curricular internship, based on an agreement between La Sapienza University and Adamello Brenta Natural GeoPark. The internship objectives and subjects were the experience with geological heritage enhancement and dissemination tools and related practical activities; geological heritage mapping; geomorphological hazards analysis along geoturist itinerariess. The result of the internship is a partnership with the Geopark, that allowed the application of the enhancement methodology developed during this doctorate on the geopark area of UNESCO Dolomites...|$|E
