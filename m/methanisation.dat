40|$|In many countries, {{the algae}} of “green tides” are {{harvested}} {{in the fight}} against pollution. Ulva often represents the main component of the tide, and intensive research has been conducted on the possibility to use the algae as a <b>methanisation</b> substrate. However, <b>methanisation</b> is hampered by various practical obstacles, which requires a compromise between productivity and biological yield. The process described here calls upon a pre-digestion phase of Ulva which, besides the economy of time and volume of the digestion, makes it possible to obtain a biogas of good quality. The <b>methanisation</b> substrate is the hydrolysis juice collected by draining, followed by pressing. The cake resulting from the pressing process can be used as organic enriching or fertilizing agent in agriculture. Various presses were tested. The screw press was found the most suitable to recover a great quantity of sufficiently loaded pressing juice after only a short hydrolysis time. For a 3 month hydrolysis period, the different fractions amounted to 158 L of hydrolysis juice, 192 L of pressing juice, and 0. 075 m 3 of cake per m 3 of initial algae. The bi-phasic anaerobic digestion with forced recuperation of juices offers interesting pollution abatement perspectives, with total and soluble chemical oxygen demand cleaning rates of respectively 79 and 95 % during the methanogenic phase, for a volume productivity of 1. 5 m 3 CH 4 m− 3 digester day− 1. The quality of the Ulva juice also makes it suitable for use as substrate for industrial processes or co-substrate of <b>methanisation</b> in pre-existing reactors, so that subsequent investment could be avoided...|$|E

In this framework, {{the capacity of}} an hyper thermophilic (65 °C) aerobic process coupled with a mesophilic (35 °C) digester was evaluated for the activated sludge degradation and was {{compared to that of}} a conventional mesophilic anaerobic digester (MAD). For two Sludge Retention Times (SRT), 21 and 42 days, the Chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilisation and biodegradation processes, the <b>methanisation</b> yield and the aerobic oxidation were investigated during 180 days. The best results were obtained at SRT of 44 days, for which the COD removal yield was 30 % higher with the Mesophilic Anaerobic Digestion / Thermophilic Aerobic Reactor (MADTAR) co-treatment compared to the conventional AD. An increase of the sludge intrinsic biodegradability is also observed (20 – 40 %), showing that the unbiodegradable COD in mesophilic conditions, becomes bioavailable to thermophilic aerobic bacteria.

40|$|The {{development}} of projects coupling an agricultural anaerobic digestion installation {{with the production}} of spirulina is an attractive concept, since the waste streams from the <b>methanisation</b> and from biogas valorization {{can be used to}} produce a high value product. This principle allows a better energetic valorization of surplus heat and of exhaust gases coming from the cogeneration unit. The limits of this configuration have been evaluated for Switzerland to study if the implementation of such coupling increases the competitiveness of agricultural anaerobic digestion. The thermal autonomy of the plant has been established as the main criterion to design the spirulina production units. For different working conditions (light radiation, nutrients source, size of <b>methanisation</b> units), the potential production of spirulina has been evaluated. The process energy yield, the environmental impact and the process economy show that 50 % of surplus heat can be valorized, being 85 - 90 % of heat contained in the exhaust gases; that the decrease in carbon dioxide emissions is not relevant and that, for the conditions tested, the operating costs are currently too high to allow the economic feasibility of the project...|$|E

40|$|The study {{deals with}} the use of Jatropha curcas {{defatted}} waste as an alternative feed in biogas plant for its bio- <b>methanisation.</b> As it remains as defatted cake after the extraction of non-edible oil from Jatropha seeds, it cannot be used directly for any purpose due to presence of toxic substance called ‘curcin’. This toxin renders it unsafe for the animal feed and other purposes. It contains 5. 73 % nitrogen, 1. 5 % phosphorus and about 1 % potassium. On the basis of its chemical composition, its application as substrate to the biogas plant can be a sustainable alternative as compared to the other applications of Jatropha press cake. The study was conducted on a floating drum type biogas plant. It was observed that the biogas plant, initially charged with pure cattle dung, when gradually replaced with Jatropha oil cake (0 - 100 %), it increased the biogas production up to approximately 25 % in reasonable time duration. A significant increase in the percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium during the bio-fermentation process invokes the use of the effluent slurry as organic manure. Simultaneous reduction in the amount of the oil (5. 67 to 3. 95 %) sustains the possibility of degradation of oil during <b>methanisation.</b> The plant has showed higher biogas yields at low temperatures also. Therefore, Jatropha defatted waste can successfully be used as a adduct as well as substrate in already running cattle dung based biogas plant to get high yield of biogas in comparison to cattle dung feed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{anaerobic}} digestion systems which are operated {{with a high}} content of total solids (so-called dry digestion) and without mixing the reactor content during digestion, the start-up phase is decisive to the overall success of the process.

The inoculum adapted to fat had a better performance in the <b>methanisation</b> of substrates with significant lipids content. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that an increase in the ratio inoculum/substrate can enhance the initial methane production rate of oily waste when using a non-adapted inoculum, improving also the ultimate methane production. Additionally, this work also reveals that changing from mesophilic to thermophilic temperature conditions an inoculum can overcome adaptation setbacks to a substrate, while another one, that displayed good mesophilic performance, can become unproductive. As the results demonstrate, the microbial consortium present in each inoculum can bring about different outcomes while degrading different organic wastes, especially in anaerobic digestion of oily waste...|$|E

This review summarises current insight of syntrophic acetate oxidising microorganisms, their presence and the detection of novel species and relate these observations with operating conditions of the biogas processes in order to explore contributing factors for development of an ammonia-tolerant microbial community that efficiently degrades acetate through the syntrophic pathway. Besides high ammonia level, acetate concentration, temperature and methanogenic community structure are considered in this review as likely factors that shape and influence SAO-mediated microbial ecosystems.

Indeed, it {{can be turned into}} useful energy (heat, electricity, fuel) and can contribute to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Experimental investigation of synthesised biogas explosion characteristics was conducted in a 20 -L sphere at various temperatures (30 - 70 degrees C) and at atmospheric pressure. The studied biogas was made of 50 %(1) methane (CH 4) and 50 % carbon dioxide (CO 2).

Its vapour water content rises along with temperature. The presence of these inert gases modifies considerably biogas characteristics compared to the ones of pure methane: explosion limits are lowered and beyond 70 degrees C, water vapour content is sufficient to inert the mixture.

This parametric study was mainly performed for the mixed sludge. Five different TS concentrations of sludge (12 - 36 g/L) were tested for different values of ES (7000 - 75, 000 kJ/kg TS) and 28 g/L was found as the optimum value according to the solubilized chemical oxygen demand in the liquid phase (SCOD).

Biomethane production from poultry litter and chicken feathers was assessed in batch assays. Pre-treatment with lime and sodium hydroxide was performed at different temperatures and pressures. Clostridium cellulolyticum, C. saccharolyticum and C. thermocellum were used as bioaugmentation strains in the anaerobic digestion of poultry litter. Fervidobacterium pennivorans was used to aid the hydrolysis of poultry feather. Anaerobic digestion of the raw wastes allowed a <b>methanisation</b> percentage (MP) of 17 ± 2 and 33 ± 5 %, respectively from poultry litter and chicken feathers, with 2. 5 % total solids.

The metaproteome expressed by thermophilic communities during cellulose anaerobic digestion was investigated in microcosms. By multiplying the analytical replicates (65 protein fractions analysed by MS/MS) and relying solely on public protein databases, more than 500 non-redundant protein functions were identified. The taxonomic community structure as inferred from the metaproteomic data set was in good overall agreement with 16 S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing and fluorescent in situ hybridisation analyses. Numerous functions related to cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis and fermentation catalysed by bacteria related to Caldicellulosiruptor spp. and Clostridium thermocellum were retrieved, indicating their {{key role in the}} cellulose-degradation process and also suggesting their complementary action. Despite the abundance of acetate as a major fermentation product, key methanogenesis enzymes from the acetoclastic pathway were not detected. In contrast, enzymes from the hydrogenotrophic pathway affiliated to Methanothermobacter were almost exclusively identified for methanogenesis, suggesting a syntrophic acetate oxidation process coupled to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Isotopic analyses confirmed the high dominance of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Very surprising was the identification of an abundant proteolytic activity from Coprothermobacter proteolyticus strains, probably acting as scavenger and/or predator performing proteolysis and fermentation.

Bio-fuels, an alternative fuels are having environmental benefit as; they are made from renewable sources. It can be blended in any proportion with mineral Diesel. Many performance and emission tests are being carried out in reciprocating diesel engines that use bio fuel but there are very few tests has been done on gas turbine engines. The gas turbine combustion is steady flame combustion. This feature creates the wide range for the different alternative fuels for clean combustion in the gas turbine, such as natural gas, petroleum distillates, pyrolysis wood gas, biogas of <b>methanisation,</b> bio-diesel etc. The present work is an analysis of the Soya bio-diesel productionprocess i. e. trans-esterification, the different parameters affecting on trans-esterification. The different physical and chemical properties of this bio-diesel and diesel has been determined and compared to establish the suitability of the bio-diesel in the gas turbine. An analysis on High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) has been done to find out the composition of the different fatty acid esters. The effect of these fatty acids onthe property of the bio-diesel has also been explained such as viscosity, heat of combustion, cetane No, cold flow properties, lubricity and oxidative stability etc. This will also help us to select best suited bio-diesel for the gas turbine...|$|E
40|$|The {{agricultural}} sector accounts for 14 % of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. If we also {{take into account}} carbon emissions and sequestration from upstream – production of fertilisers, deforestation, etc. – and downstream – bio-energies, etc. – the share rises to 30 %. Many practices and technologies enable agriculture's impact on climate change to be reduced. According {{to a number of}} estimates that are summarised in this research, the {{agricultural sector}}’s mitigation potential is of the same order of magnitude as its emissions over a period of 30 years. However, changing agricultural practices comes at a cost, and in most cases such changes are not made without economic incentives. Carbon offsetting projects are one of the economic tools available to reduce agricultural emissions by paying for metric tons of avoided CO 2 e emissions. A summary of the emission reductions enabled by agricultural projects to date is provided in this report. It covers most projects certified by quality assurance standards, including those set up by the Kyoto Protocol (Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation) and those in the voluntary market (Verified Carbon Standard, Climate Action Reserve, Gold Standard, Chicago Climate Exchange, and American Carbon Registry). The assessment drawn up on this basis shows that emission reductions enabled through carbon offsetting are thousand times lower than actual emissions and their potential mitigation. Agricultural projects have reduced emissions by 14 MtCO 2 e in 2010, i. e. 7 % of the reductions generated by all carbon offset projects across all sectors for this year. Initiatives focus on three technologies: bio-energies (crop residues), <b>methanisation</b> of livestock waste, and soil carbon sequestration using no-till practices. This is very little compared with the large number of mitigation technologies {{that could be used in}} this sector. The diffuse nature of agricultural emissions and the cost of the abatement measures are the main obstacles to developing agricultural projects. However, the introduction of multi-farm aggregators enables to share costs. Moreover, research on new techniques for measuring emissions more efficiently and less costly is a mean to overcome these obstacles and release the mitigation potential...|$|E
40|$|An {{in-house}} developed {{method is}} presented for the purity analysis of nitrogen (N 2) built-in purifier (BIPTM)) gas for the trace contaminant gases carbon dioxide (CO 2), oxygen (O 2)) and carbon monoxide (CO), using gas chromatography with a pulsed discharge helium ionisation detector (GC-PDHID). Nitrogen BIPTM gas {{is used as}} a “matrix” gas or diluent gas for the gravimetric preparation of binary reference materials of CO, CO 2), sulphur dioxide (SO 2)) and nitric oxide (NO) at the CSIR NML gas metrology laboratory. Purity analysis of nitrogen BIPTM is required to decrease the measurement uncertainty of the calculated gravimetric concentrations of the gaseous reference materials produced. The aim of the research was to find a method where amounts < 0. 25 x 10 - 6 mol•mol- 1 of CO 2), O 2) and CO could be simultaneously analysed in high purity nitrogen within a short time, with minimum cost and on a routine basis. Gas mixtures of trace amounts of CO 2), O 2) and CO in N 2) were separated and quantified using a parallel dual capillary column configuration with temperature and pressure programming and a pulsed discharge helium ionisation detector (PDHID). The detection limits were 9 x 10 - 9 mol•mol- 1 for CO 2), 7 x 10 - 9 mol•mol- 1 for O 2) and 37 x 10 - 9 mol•mol- 1 for CO with repeatability precision of 1 % for carbon dioxide, 1 % for oxygen and 10 % for carbon monoxide for a 0. 2 x 10 - 6 mol•mol- 1 standard. The detection limits obtained were lower than those reported previously by other investigators for similar methods and the validation for the method as set out in this investigation seems to be the first for trace amounts of CO 2), O 2) and CO in nitrogen. The method was validated by comparison of the CO 2) and CO results with results obtained using a flame ionisation detector and <b>methanisation.</b> The technique of sequence reversal was used to improve the peak shape of CO but there was no improvement on the results obtained with temperature and pressure programming. Although no helium purging was used to reduce atmospheric contamination, it was shown that the main source of contamination from the air was through the sampling system which was reduced to a level of ± 20 x 10 - 9 mol•mol- 1 oxygen simply by using a higher sample flow rate. It was also found that even when large amounts of CO 2) were adsorbed onto the molecular sieve column, this made no difference to the column performance at trace levels. The method has also been validated for the analysis of nitrogen in high purity oxygen and may also be used to analyse carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide in oxygen as well.

40|$|In Sweden, {{biofuels}} {{have come}} into substantial use, in an extent that are claimed to be bigger than use of fossil oil. One driving force for this have been the CO 2 -tax that was introduced in 1991 (1). According to SVEBIO:s calculations (2) based on the Swedish Energy Agency´s prognosis, the total energy consumption in Sweden 2012 was 404 TWh. If the figure is broken down on the different energy sources (figure 1) one {{can see that the}} consumption roughly distribute in three different, equally sized, blocks, Biofuels, fossil fuels and water & nuclear power. The major use of the fossil fuels is for transport and the water & nuclear power is used as electric power. The main use of the biofuels is for heating in the industrial sector and as district heating. In 2009 the consumption from those two segments was 85 TWh, and 10 TWh of bio power was co-produced giving an average biomass to electricity efficiency of 12 %. This indicates a substantial conversion potential from hot water production to combined heat and power (CHP) production. in Sweden 2013 broken down on the different energy sources. In 2006 the pulp, paper and sawmill industry accounted for 95 % of the bio energy consumption in the industrial sector, and the major biofuel consumed was black liquor (5). However, the pulp and paper industries also produced the black liquor in their own processes. The major energy source (58 %) for district heating during 2006 was woody biomass (chips, pellets etc.) followed by waste (24 %), peat (6 %) and others (12 %) (5). The use of peat has probably decreased since 2006 since peat is no longer regarded as a renewable energy source. While the use of biofuel for heating purpose is well developed and the bio-power is expected to grow, the use in the transport sector is small, 9 TWh or 7 % in 2011. The main consumption there is due to the mandatory addition (5 %) of ethanol to gasoline and FAME to diesel (6). The Swedish authorities have announced plans to increase the renewable content to 7. 5 % in 2015 on the way to fulfill the EU’s goal of 10 % renewable transportation fuels in 2020. However the new proposed fuel directive in EU says that a maximum of 5 % renewable fuel may be produced from food sources like sugars and vegetable oils. Another bothersome fact is that, in principle, all rape seed oil produced in Sweden is consumed (95 - 97 %) in the food sector, and consequently all FAME used (in principle) in Sweden is imported as FAME, rape seed oil or seed (6). In Sweden a new source of biodiesel have emerged, tall oil diesel. Tall oil is extracted from black liquor and refined into a diesel fraction (not FAME) and can be mixed into fossil diesel, i. e. Preem Evolution diesel. The SUNPINE plant in Piteå have a capacity of 100 000 metric tons of tall oil diesel per annum, while the total potential in all of Sweden is claimed to be 200 000 tons (7). 100 000 tons of tall oil corresponds to 1 % of the total diesel consumption in Sweden. in Sweden for 2010 and a prognosis for 2014. (6). Accordingly, the profoundest task is to decrease the fossil fuel dependency in the transport sector, and clearly, the first generation biofuels can´t do this on its own. Biogas is a fuel gas with high methane content {{that can be used in}} a similar way to natural gas; for instance for cooking, heating and as transportation fuel. Today biogas is produced by fermentation of waste (municipal waste, sludge, manure), but can be produced by gasification of biomass, for instance from forest residues such as branches and rots (GROT in Swedish). To get high efficiency in the production, the lower hydrocarbons, mainly methane, in the producer gas, should not be converted into synthesis gas. Instead a synthesis gas with high methane content is sought. This limits the drainage of chemically bonded energy, due to the exothermic reaction in the synthesis step (so called <b>methanisation).</b> In 2011 0. 7 TWh of biogas was produced in Sweden by fermentation of waste (6) and there were no production by gasification, at least not of economic importance. The potential seems to be large, though. In 2008 the total potential for biogas production, in Sweden, from waste by fermentation and gasification was estimated to 70 TWh (10 TWh fermentation and 60 TWh gasification) (8). This figure includes only different types of waste and no dedicated agricultural crops or dedicated forest harvest. Activities in the biogas sector, by gasification, in Sweden are the Göteborgs energi´s Gobigas project in Gothenburg and Eon´s Bio 2 G-project, now pending, in south of Sweden. If the producer gas is cleaned and upgraded into synthesis gas also other fuels could be produced. In Sweden methanol and DME productions are planned for in the Värmlands metanol-project and at Chemrecs DME production plant in Piteå. Nationellt förgasningscente...|$|E
