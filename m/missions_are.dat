5|$|<b>Missions</b> <b>are</b> tasks {{undertaken}} by a clan. There are {{four types of}} missions: regular, encounter, dispatch, and area. In regular missions, Marche's entire party ventures to a particular location to do battle. Many of these <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> used to advance the story. In encounter missions, Marche's group battles a rival mercenary clan by purchasing a mission or meeting them on the map. In dispatch missions, which do not involve battle, Marche temporarily sends away one member from his party. Area <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> usually a dispatch mission where Marche's clan can liberate certain regions to obtain bonuses and discounts at shops.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{plays out}} through 26 missions, with story scenes that tie the plot together occurring between {{and during the}} battles. In addition, 38 training <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> unlocked as the <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> completed. The training <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> more challenging, entirely optional, and can be played separately from the campaign. One new feature in Days of Ruin is that campaign missions can now be played individually as the player completes them. Like the training missions, campaign missions can be selected {{from the main menu}} at any time.|$|E
5|$|Dhaka hosts 54 {{resident}} embassies {{and high}} commissions and numerous international organizations. Most diplomatic <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> located in Gulshan and Baridhara {{area of the}} city. The Agargaon area near Parliament {{is home to the}} country offices of the United Nations, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Islamic Development Bank.|$|E
50|$|The Japanese <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> {{split in}} 1968, {{with the mission}} {{headquartered}} in Tokyo retaining that name while a new <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> organized based in southern Japan that was designated the Japan-Okinawa Mission. The new <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> headed by Edward Y. Okazaki, a Japanese-American, along with his Japanese-American wife Chieko N. Okazaki. This <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> split again two years later. The Japan Central <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> organized with headquarters in Kobe and with Okazaki continuing as president of that mission. The Japan West <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> also organized at this time with headquarters in Fukuoka.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1945 the Texas <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> {{renamed the}} Texas Louisiana Mission. In October 1947 the Central Atlantic States <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> formed from the East Central States <b>Mission.</b> This <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> {{headquartered}} at Roanoke, Virginia. [...] In 1970 this <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> renamed the North Carolina-Virginia Mission. In 1974 {{it became the}} Virginia Roanoke <b>Mission.</b> It <b>was</b> renamed the Virginia Richmond Mission in February 1992 and currently has its headquarters in Richmond.|$|R
50|$|In 1902, the Middle States <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> {{created with}} Ben E. Rich as {{president}}. However, in 1903, Ephraim H. Nye, {{president of the}} Southern States <b>mission,</b> died. He <b>was</b> replaced by Ben E. Rich and {{the boundaries of the}} <b>missions</b> <b>were</b> realigned. In 1904, the Southwestern States <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> renamed the Central States Mission. After the San Francisco earthquake and fire in 1906, the <b>mission</b> headquarters <b>was</b> relocated to Los Angeles from San Francisco. In the next few years the headquarters of the Central States <b>Mission</b> <b>were</b> moved to Independence, Missouri, and the headquarters of the Northwestern States <b>Mission</b> <b>were</b> moved to Portland, Oregon. By 1907, the Colorado <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> renamed the Western States Mission. Also in these years, the headquarters of the Southern States Mission moved from Chattanooga to Atlanta, Georgia.|$|R
5|$|A church, or group, that {{is unable}} to fully provide for the {{religious}} needs of its members is called a mission. <b>Missions</b> <b>are</b> dependent on a congregation which is administered by a minister. A group of several congregations with their missions form a district. The Church in each nation is divided into multiple districts. In Mexico, several districts form together into five jurisdictions that act as legal entities.|$|E
5|$|Many of Canberra's suburbs {{are named}} after former Prime Ministers, famous Australians, early settlers, or use Aboriginal words for their title. Street names {{typically}} follow a particular theme; for example, {{the streets of}} Duffy are named after Australian dams and reservoirs, the streets of Dunlop are named after Australian inventions, inventors and artists and the streets of Page are named after biologists and naturalists. Most diplomatic <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> located {{in the suburbs of}} Yarralumla, Deakin and O'Malley. There are three light industrial areas: the suburbs of Fyshwick, Mitchell and Hume.|$|E
5|$|NASA's ongoing {{investigations}} include in-depth surveys of Mars (Mars 2020 and InSight) and Saturn and {{studies of the}} Earth and the Sun. Other active spacecraft <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> Juno for Jupiter, New Horizons (for Jupiter, Pluto, and beyond), and Dawn for the asteroid belt. NASA continued to support in situ exploration beyond the asteroid belt, including Pioneer and Voyager traverses into the unexplored trans-Pluto region, and Gas Giant orbiters Galileo (1989–2003), Cassini(1997–2017), and Juno (2011–).|$|E
40|$|The Mars Rover/Sample Return <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> {{examined}} as {{a precursor}} to a manned mission to Mars. The value of precursor <b>missions</b> <b>is</b> noted, using the Apollo lunar program as an example. The scientific objectives of the Mars Rover/Sample Return <b>mission</b> <b>are</b> listed and the basic <b>mission</b> plans <b>are</b> described. Consideration {{is given to the}} options for mission design, launch configurations, rover construction, and entry and lander design. Also, the potential for international cooperation on the Mars Rover/Sample Return <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> discussed...|$|R
5000|$|In 1949 the Great Lakes <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> organized, {{consisting}} of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio. The West Central States <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> organized in 1950, consisting primarily of Montana and Wyoming. There {{was then a}} break until a new <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> organized in the United States. There <b>was</b> no new <b>mission</b> organized in the United States for almost eight years after this. The general plan of having [...] "states" [...] in the various <b>mission</b> names <b>was</b> expanded when in 1955 the Texas-Louisiana <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> renamed the Gulf States Mission.|$|R
5000|$|Operation Boxer II- This <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> to {{interrupt}} the transportation of the supplies around Yongdae-ri. The <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> deemed successful ...|$|R
5|$|The Intelligence Support Activity (ISA, The Activity) is {{the support}} branch of JSOC and USSOCOM. Its primary <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> to provide Human Intelligence (HUMINT) and Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) mainly for Delta and DEVGRU's operations. Before the {{establishing}} of the Strategic Support Branch in 2001, the ISA required {{the permission of}} the CIA to conduct covert operations, which considerably lessened its effectiveness in its support of JSOC operations as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The storyline is {{primarily}} followed with missions through the governing nations {{that exist in}} the base game as well as each expansion that the player is affiliated with. Nation or governing body affiliation is relatively simple, sometimes requiring prerequisite quests being completed and have several stages of progression to achieve higher recognition and reward throughout each story. Some <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> even required to be completed to further progress into the start of the additional storylines of each expansion or specific areas.|$|E
5|$|The third disc from Integral was {{released}} as a stand-alone game in North America {{under the title}} of Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions on September 23, 1999. While the content of VR <b>Missions</b> <b>are</b> virtually identical to Integrals VR Disc, the unlocking requirements for the Ninja missions and the photoshoot mode were changed accordingly so {{that they no longer}} required save data from the main game or any use of the PocketStation.|$|E
50|$|The {{consistence}} of {{the organisation}} was formed from three sections. The first section's <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> searching, finding and collecting {{the information about}} anti governmental organisations and individuals. The second section's <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> editing and reporting the information. The third section's <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> to inform Abdulhamid II.|$|R
50|$|The wing's <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> largely undisclosed; however, it {{is known}} that one of its <b>missions</b> <b>was</b> aerial {{refueling}} of combat aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|In 1964 the Cumorah <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> {{organized}} {{from the}} Eastern States Mission. Headquartered in Rochester, New York this {{showed that the}} [...] "states" [...] naming of <b>missions</b> <b>was</b> doomed. This <b>mission</b> would <b>be</b> renamed New York Rochester in 1974. This year also saw {{the organization of the}} Northern Indian Mission, organized from the Southwest Indian Mission, formerly the Navajo-Zuni <b>Mission.</b> This <b>was</b> the heyday of separate missions organized to proselyte with specific linguistic and ethnic groups. The California South <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> formed in June 1966. 1967 saw two new missions that showed that [...] "states" [...] no longer made sense with <b>missions</b> since it <b>was</b> becoming true that missions often covered no more than one state. The Ohio <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> organized from the Great Lakes Mission and the Texas South <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> organized from the Texas and the Spanish-American missions. 1967 also saw the rest of the Spanish American Mission put in the Western States and Texas Missions. A decision had been made to have missionaries assigned to missions by area and not language. The full effects of this decision would not been seen for a few more years. On the 1st day of 1968 the Pacific Northwest <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> organized. This made it so the Northwestern States <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> essential Oregon and adjacent parts of Idaho and the Pacific Northwest <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> Washington with neighboring portions of Idaho.|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} {{missions}} {{in which the}} player controls a motor vehicle. Though the game engine {{is the same as}} the third-person mode, these <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> based on being in a vehicle. They usually involve getting to a certain location in a certain time period, often while avoiding pursuers while heading to the end point. Weapons can not be used while in a vehicle. While the PDA is not available in these mission types, a map of the city is. Cell phone calls are also sometimes received in these missions.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem is a {{tactical}} role-playing game which puts {{players in the}} role of a customizable Avatar: their gender, appearance, character class and statistics can be tailored by the player. <b>Missions</b> <b>are</b> split between story-based chapters and optional side chapters: side chapters give access to new playable characters outside the main narrative. Players can save at any time during battles, with the game opening offering a save {{at the end of each}} chapter. Outside battles, the player can visit towns to buy supplies and items such as weapons. Characters recruited by the player can also engage in support conversations accessed through the battle menu: these raise a character's support rank and grant boons during battle. How characters connect through supports is documented using a relationship chart.|$|E
5|$|Hit & Run {{has seven}} levels, each with {{missions}} and sub-plot. The player can control one specific character in each level. The game's playable characters are Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge, and Apu. Homer and Bart are played twice. When travelling on foot, the player character can walk, run, and perform {{three types of}} melee attacks: a normal kick, a jumping kick, and a smashing move. To drive, the player can either commandeer {{one of the many}} civilian vehicles that drive endlessly around town, or use a phone booth to select a car. The game's driving <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> also similar to those of Grand Theft Auto III. In both games, the player races against other characters, collects items before a timer runs out, and wrecks other cars.|$|E
50|$|Misión Santa Rosa de las Palmas, {{also known}} as Todos Santos <b>Mission,</b> <b>was</b> founded by the Roman Catholic Jesuits in 1733. After 1748, the <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> known as Nuestra Señora del Pilar de la Paz. The <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> the first European {{settlement}} {{at the site of}} what is now the city of Todos Santos, Baja California Sur. The Santa Rosa <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> located {{in one of the few}} areas of Baja California suitable for agriculture. The residents of the <b>Mission</b> <b>were</b> primarily Guaycura Native Americans (American Indians) whom the Jesuits and their successors, the Franciscans and Dominicans, attempted to convert to Christianity and to make into sedentary farm workers. Recurrent epidemics of introduced European diseases reduced the Indian population to only a handful by the 19th century and in 1825 the <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> closed.|$|R
5|$|STS-300 was the {{designation}} for the Space Shuttle Launch on Need (LON) <b>missions</b> to <b>be</b> launched {{on short notice}} for STS-114 and STS-121, {{in the event that}} the shuttle became disabled or damaged and could not safely return to Earth. The rescue flight for STS-115, if needed, would have been STS-301. After STS-115, the rescue <b>mission</b> designations <b>were</b> based on the corresponding regular <b>mission</b> that would <b>be</b> replaced should the rescue <b>mission</b> <b>be</b> needed. For example, the STS-116 rescue <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> branded STS-317, because the normal mission scheduled after STS-116 was STS-117. Should the rescue <b>mission</b> have <b>been</b> needed, the crew and vehicle for STS-117 would assume the rescue mission profile and become STS-317. All potential rescue <b>missions</b> <b>were</b> to be launched with a crew of four, and would return with ten or eleven crew members, depending on the number of crew launched on the rescued shuttle. <b>Missions</b> <b>were</b> expected to last approximately eleven days. None of the planned contingency <b>missions</b> <b>was</b> ever flown.|$|R
5000|$|The Second Japanese Embassy to Europe (第２回遣欧使節, also [...] ), {{also called}} the Ikeda <b>Mission,</b> <b>was</b> sent on December 29, 1863 by the Tokugawa shogunate. The head of the <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> Ikeda Nagaoki, {{governor}} of small villages of Ibara, Bitchū Province (Okayama Prefecture). The assistant head of the <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> Kawazu Sukekuni.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to CAP's own corporate fleet, many member-owned aircraft are {{made available for}} official tasking by CAP's volunteers should the need arise. Aircraft on search <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> generally crewed by at least three qualified aircrew members: a Mission Pilot, responsible for the safe flying of the aircraft; a Mission Observer, responsible for navigation, communications and coordination of the mission as well as ground observation; and a Mission Scanner {{who is responsible for}} looking for crash sites and damage clues. Additionally, the mission scanner may double as a satellite digital imaging system (SDIS) operator. Larger aircraft may have additional scanners aboard, providing greater visual coverage. Because of the additional ARCHER equipment, the crew of a Civil Air Patrol GA8 Airvan may also include an operator of the ARCHER system, depending upon the requirements of the mission and the capabilities of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Like the series, {{the game}} takes place over 24 hours {{and has the}} same start and end clocks for each hour, marking the start and end of {{each part of the}} game. The hours are broken down into 58 {{separate}} missions, of which there are three broad types, each described in further detail below. Some <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> objective based, while others have a time-restricted element. Each mission is graded out of 100 points, based on the quality of performance, number of objectives completed, shooting accuracy and so on. A grade of 90 points or higher rewards the player by unlocking some form of bonus feature, including three movies (interviews with cast about the game, TV promos), 98 images (wallpaper-like images of main characters) and 23 characters (3D models that the player can view).|$|E
5|$|StarCraft {{focuses around}} three {{distinct}} interstellar species: the psionic Protoss, the adaptable Terrans, and the insectoid Zerg. The game revolves around players collecting resources {{to construct a}} base, upgrade their militaries, and ultimately conquer opponents. Brood Wars gameplay remains fundamentally unchanged from that of StarCraft, although it made small alterations to unit costs and some abilities, and added some new units. These changes make rushing tactics—a factor that gained some criticism in the original StarCraft—less practical. The single-player campaign has an increased difficulty; <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> no longer entirely linear, and a greater focus on strategy is needed to complete missions. In addition, the game's artificial intelligence (AI) has been augmented so that AI-controlled players are more intelligent and tend to use tactics more effectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mission</b> <b>is</b> {{a city in}} Hidalgo County, Texas. The {{population}} was 80,452 in 2012. <b>Mission</b> <b>is</b> part of the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission and Reynosa-McAllen metropolitan areas.|$|R
5000|$|Operation Mustang IV- This sixteen crew <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> to {{dismantle}} a railroad that would cut some necessary supplies. This <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> considered a failure.|$|R
50|$|The {{first set}} of three SMEX <b>missions</b> <b>were</b> {{launched}} between 1992 and 1998. The second set of two <b>missions</b> <b>were</b> launched in 1998 and 1999. These <b>missions</b> <b>were</b> managed by the Small Explorer Project Office at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). In early 1999, that office was closed and with the announcement of opportunity for the third set of SMEX missions NASA converted the program so that each <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> managed by its Principal Investigator, with oversight by the GSFC Explorers Project.|$|R
5|$|The {{entire class}} {{is based at}} , also known as Fleet Base West, which is located on Garden Island, {{off the coast of}} Western Australia. The {{decision}} to locate all six submarines at Stirling was prompted by the lack of suitable long-term facilities on the east coast of Australia (although individual submarines can use Fleet Base East in Sydney Harbour as a forward staging facility), and the proximity to Australian offshore interests, including most of the nation's external territories, the oil and natural gas resources of the North West Shelf, and the Indian Ocean sea lines of communication, through which the majority of Australia's seaborne trade passes. The submarines' primary <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> patrolling the waters of Australia and nearby nations, and gathering intelligence through the interception of electronic communications by foreign nations and the deployment/retrieval of special forces operatives.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{provides}} a co-operative mode where two players may play through the game's campaign together via split-screen, system link, or through the Xbox Live online service. In co-operative, the <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> slightly altered to suit both players. For instance, some doors may require two players to open them. Additionally, in certain missions, the second player can occasionally start {{far away from the}} main player and takes over an allied character that was AI-controlled in the single player campaign. The respawn procedure is also altered substantially, as if one player dies, the other has to find and revive the partner's corpse to bring it back to life.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a first-person {{perspective}} and allows the player to undertake a series of assassination missions {{in a variety of}} ways, with an emphasis on player choice. Missions can be completed through stealth, combat, or a combination of both. Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions, eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and <b>missions</b> <b>are</b> changed in response to the player's violent actions or lack thereof. Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1958 the West Spanish-American <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> {{organized}}. In October 1960 the Eastern Atlantic States <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> organized with George B. Hill as president. This mission {{included the}} District of Columbia, Maryland, Delaware and southern New Jersey. This {{was the last}} new mission formed with [...] "states" [...] in its name. The next month the Florida <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> organized with Karl R. Lyman as president. In February 1961 a new Texas <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> split off from the Gulf States Mission.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mission</b> <b>is</b> an unincorporated {{community}} in Sussex County, Delaware, United States. <b>Mission</b> <b>is</b> located along Delaware Route 24 and Delaware Route 30 southwest of Millsboro.|$|R
