Another part of work focuses on the application and harvest lines in crop production. <b>Swap</b> <b>body</b> types and their comparison of technical parameters are described. The technical-economic parameters at tractor set with <b>swap</b> <b>body</b> system compared and tractor set with single-purpose semitrailer are compared.

50|$|Many <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> are {{fitted with}} four up-folding legs under their frame. These legs make it {{possible}} to change or “swap” their body from one carriage to another, or to leave the <b>swap</b> <b>body</b> at a destination, without using extra equipment such as a crane or hoist.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Swap</b> <b>bodies</b> take {{advantage}} of the large number of trailers used to carry standard ISO containers. The design of <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> and roller container is optimized to minimize empty weight, saving on trucking fuel cost (less dead weight to be transported).and cost of built of reloading terminals.|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{unreliability}} of {{the rail}} transports COOP choose trailers and not <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> as cargo units. <b>Swap</b> <b>bodies</b> have a lower net weight (three tonnes; they can accommodate 18 pallets) than trailers (ten tonnes; they can accommodate 33 pallets). For COOP, in 90  % of all cases {{the volume of the}} products (rather than the weight) is the limiting factor when filling cargo units. The use of trailers with a higher net weight than <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> leads tentatively to higher energy costs per tonne-kilometre; these extra costs are negligible for COOP.|$|R

50|$|<b>Swap</b> <b>bodies</b> are {{typically}} {{more expensive than}} equivalent payload ISO containers. This is because the ISO containers used in Europe {{are typically}} manufactured in China, whereas <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> are made in Europe (central Europe and the UK). The lighter weight of the body offsets this cost in fuel savings during transport and increased cargo capacity.|$|R

50|$|As a consequence, <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> do {{not have}} upper corner fittings, are not stackable, and must be lifted by the bottom frame, unlike the more {{widespread}} shipping containers (ISO containers). This makes them unsuitable for ship-based overseas transportation. Because they are not stackable and are lifted by the bottom corners, they require special handling when transported by rail. Due to security concerns, {{an increasing number of}} <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> have a hard surface instead of curtains and tarpaulins.|$|R

25|$|Following the {{extended}} usage of pallet-wide containers in Europe the EU started the Intermodal Loading Unit (ILU) initiative. This showed advantages for intermodal transport of containers and <b>swap</b> <b>bodies.</b> This {{led to the}} introduction of ILU-Codes defined by the standard EN 13044 which has the same format as the earlier BIC-Codes. The International Container Office BIC agreed to only issue ownership codes ending with U, J or Z. The new allocation office of the UIRR (International Union of Combined Road-Rail Transport Companies) agreed to only issue ownership reporting marks for <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> ending with A, B, C, D or K – companies having a BIC-Code ending with U can allocate an ILU-Code ending with K having the same preceding letters. Since July 2011 the new ILU codes can be registered, beginning with July 2014 all intermodal ISO containers and intermodal <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> must have an ownership code and by July 2019 all of them must bear a standard-conforming placard.|$|R
