Based on the observation that <b>module</b> <b>architectures</b> consist of basic specifications like body or export interface and relations like the implementation relation between them, or the import relation between a client and a server module, module concepts are characterized by answering the questions 1. What are the basic specifications? 2. Which relations between specifications are used? 3. How are specifications and relations combined to <b>module</b> <b>architectures?</b> These three questions are investigated for five module concepts available in the literature. As a reference example, a sample modular specification of resource management in distributed operating systems is presented...|$|R

40|$|Protected <b>module</b> <b>architectures</b> (PMA) are an {{isolation}} {{mechanism that}} emerg-ing processors provide as security {{building blocks for}} modern software systems. Reasoning about these building blocks means reasoning about elaborate assem-bly code, which can be very complex due to the loose structure of the code. One way to overcome this complexity is providing the code with a well-structured semantics. This paper presents one such semantics, namely a fully abstract trace semantics, for an assembly language enhanced with PMA. The trace semantics represents the behaviour of protected assembly code with simple abstractions, unburdened by low-level details, at the maximum degree of precision. Further-more, it captures the capabilities of attackers to protected code and simplifies the formulation of a secure compiler targeting PMA-enhanced assembly lan-guage...|$|R

40|$|Baldwin and Clark (2000) {{brought the}} {{substantial}} {{attention to the}} concept of product architecture. This concept, particularly the concept of <b>module</b> <b>architecture,</b> defines a product system as a "coordination system," taking the viewpoint that a product system is an object that is used by human users or developed by human developers. In this paper, product architecture is defined as a design concept for a product system that calls for complex part-to-part coordination in order to fulfill the user's objectives, whereby we seek to show that <b>module</b> <b>architecture</b> can clarify (1) the functions of a product, and (2) the relationship between users' commands and corresponding product actions. By doing so, it becomes possible for human users or developers, whose actions and behaviors are instinctively "context dependent," to operate and use highly complex systems as well as to design and develop new systems by seeking an appropriate combination of division of labor and collaboration between human beings and product systems. ...|$|E

40|$|Protected <b>module</b> <b>architectures</b> such as Intel SGX {{hold the}} promise of {{protecting}} sensitive computations from a potentially compromised operating system. Recent research convincingly demonstrated, however, that SGX's strengthened adversary model also gives rise to to {{a new class of}} powerful, low-noise side-channel attacks leveraging first-rate control over hardware. These attacks commonly rely on frequent enclave preemptions to obtain fine-grained side-channel observations. A maximal temporal resolution is achieved when the victim state is measured after every instruction. Current state-of-the-art enclave execution control schemes, however, do not generally achieve such instruction-level granularity. This paper presents SGX-Step, an open-source Linux kernel framework that allows an untrusted host process to configure APIC timer interrupts and track page table entries directly from user space. We contribute and evaluate an improved approach to single-step enclaved execution at instruction-level granularity, and we show how SGX-Step enables several new or improved attacks. Finally, we discuss its implications for the design of effective defense mechanisms. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A new {{technique}} has been devised for {{the manufacture of}} thin (< 60 µm) highly efficient single crystalline solar cells. Novel methods of encapsulating these Sliver ® solar cells have also been devised. Narrow grooves are formed through a 1 - 2 mm thick wafer. Device processing (diffusion, oxidation, deposition) is performed on the wafer, so {{that each of the}} narrow strips becomes a solar cell. The strips are then detached from the wafer and laid on their sides, which greatly increases the surface area of solar cell that can be obtained from the wafer. Further gains of a factor of two can be obtained by utilising a simple method of static concentration. Large decreases in processing effort (up to 30 -fold) and silicon usage (up to 10 -fold) per m 2 of module are possible. The size, thickness and bifacial nature of the cells create the opportunity {{for a wide variety of}} <b>module</b> <b>architectures</b> and applications...|$|R
