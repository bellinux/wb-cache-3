50|$|First, {{adhesive}} {{from the}} HybriWell is peeled {{off and the}} HybriWell is attached over {{the area of the}} slide printed with the gelatin-DNA solution. Second, 200ul of transfection mix is pipetted into one of the HybriWell ports; the <b>mixture</b> will distribute <b>evenly</b> <b>over</b> the array. The array is then incubated, with temperature and time dependent on the cell types used. Third, the transfection mix is pipetted away and the HybriWell removed with a thin-tipped forceps. Fourth, the printed slide treated with transfection reagent is placed into a square dish with the printed side facing up. Fifth, the harvested cells are gently poured onto the slides (not on the printed areas). Finally, the dish is placed in a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator and incubated overnight.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a distributed storage system where the storage nodes have heterogeneous access probabilities. The {{problem is to}} allocate a given storage budget across the nodes so as to store a unit-size data object with maximum reliability. We propose efficient algorithms for optimizing over several classes of allocations. In the basic one-level symmetric allocation, the storage budget is spread <b>evenly</b> <b>over</b> an appropriately chosen subset of nodes. In the multi k-level symmetric allocation, the budget is divided into k parts, each spread <b>evenly</b> <b>over</b> a different subset of nodes, such that the amount allocated to each node in the higher levels is multiple {{times that of the}} last level. These allocations are simpler and are shown to outperform existing methods in numerical experiments. We also describe an application of the symmetric allocations to the design of streaming codes.
