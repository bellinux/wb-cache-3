25|$|A scale {{also allows}} bullets and <b>cases</b> to be <b>sorted</b> by weight, which can {{increase}} consistency further. Sorting bullets by weight has obvious benefits, as {{each set of}} matched bullets will perform more consistently. <b>Sorting</b> <b>cases</b> by weight is done to group cases by case wall thickness, and match cases with similar interior volumes. Military cases, for example, tend to be thicker, while cases that have been reloaded numerous times will have thinner walls due to brass flowing forward under firing, and excess case length being later trimmed from the case mouth.|$|R
40|$|Most lawyers, law professors, {{and judges}} are {{familiar}} with two standard critiques of formalism in legal reasoning. One is the unacknowledged-policymaking critique. This critique argues that formalist reasoning purports to be above judicial policymaking but instead simply hides the policy decisions offstage. The other is the false-determinacy critique.

50|$|The {{internal}} {{volume of}} the cartridge case, or case capacity, significantly affects the pressure developed during ignition, which significantly affects the velocity of the bullet. Cases from different manufacturers can vary in wall thickness, and as cases are repeatedly fired and reloaded the brass flows up to the neck and is trimmed off, increasing capacity as well as weakening the case. The first step to ensuring consistent <b>case</b> capacity is <b>sorting</b> the <b>cases</b> by headstamp, so each lot of cases is from the same manufacturer and/or year. A further step would be to then weigh these <b>cases,</b> and <b>sort</b> by <b>case</b> weight.|$|R
25|$|When {{previously}} fired {{cases are}} used, {{they must be}} inspected before loading. Cases that are dirty or tarnished are often polished in a tumbler to remove oxidation and allow easier inspection of the case. Cleaning in a tumbler will also clean the interior of cases, which is often considered important for handloading high-precision target rounds. Cracked necks, non-reloadable cases (steel, aluminum, or Berdan primed cases), and signs of head separation are all reasons to reject a case. Cases are measured for length, and any that are over the recommended length are trimmed down to the minimum length. Competition shooters will also <b>sort</b> <b>cases</b> by brand and weight to ensure consistency.|$|R

30|$|Cluster {{analysis}} is an exploratory data analysis tool for solving classification problems. Its {{object is to}} <b>sort</b> <b>cases,</b> data or objects (events, people, things, etc.) into groups or clusters (McGarial et al. 2000). The resulting clusters of objects should exhibit high internal (within-clusters) homogeneity and high external (between-clusters) heterogeneity (McGarial et al. 2000). The greater the similarity (or homogeneity) within a group, and the greater the difference between groups, the better or more distinct the clustering. Various types of cluster analysis {{have been used to}} analyse water chemistry data for both surface water and groundwater (Güler et al. 2002) Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis (HACA) is normally use to examine the water-quality data for spatial and temporal differences.|$|R

40|$|Cluster {{analysis}} {{refers to}} a class of data reduction methods used for <b>sorting</b> <b>cases,</b> observations, or variables of a given dataset into homogeneous groups that differ from each other. The present paper focuses on hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis, a statistical technique where groups are sequentially created by systematically merging similar clusters together, as dictated by the distance and linkage measures chosen by the researcher. Specific distance and linkage measures are reviewed, including a discussion of how these choices can influence the clustering process by comparing three common linkage measures (single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage). The tutorial guides researchers in performing a hierarchical cluster analysis using the SPSS statistical software. Through an example, we demonstrate how cluster analysis {{can be used to}} detect meaningful subgroups in a sample of bilinguals by examining various language variables...|$|R

40|$|A many-sorted variant, called stalk format, of {{the single}} sorted tyft-format for {{transition}} system specifications, introduced by Groote and Vaandrager, is proposed. The stalk format is {{shown to be a}} convenient formalism to express continuation-style transition systems for languages incorporating concepts as, e. g., process creation or backtracking, for which the existing formats seem less adequate. It is proved, extending a similar result for the single <b>sorted</b> <b>case,</b> that for an appropriate generalization of (strong) bisimilarity for the present many-sorted setting, bisimulation with respect to a transition system specification in stalk format, is a congruence. It is argued that the several conditions, required for the type of transition system specification put forward in the paper, can not be relaxed without loosing this congruence. Finally, the present format is compared with several existing ones in the literature, viz. De Simone-, GSOS- and pure tyft-format. Keywords and phrases se [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytic}} {{evaluation of the}} runtime behavior of the C 4. 5 algorithm which highlights some efficiency improvements. Based on the analytic evaluation, we have implemented a more efficient version of the algorithm, called EC 4. 5. It improves on C 4. 5 by adopting the best among three strategies for computing the information gain of continuous attributes. All the strategies adopt a binary search of the threshold in the whole training set starting from the local threshold computed at a node. The first strategy computes the local threshold using the algorithm of C 4. 5, which, in particular, <b>sorts</b> <b>cases</b> {{by means of the}} quicksoft method. The second strategy also uses the algorithm of C 4. 5, but adopts a counting sort method. The third strategy calculates the local threshold using a main-memory version of the RainForest algorithm, which does not need sorting. Our implementation computes the same decision trees as C 4. 5 with a performance gain of up to five times...|$|R
40|$|Latent {{variable}} mixture modeling {{represents a}} flexible approach to investigating population heterogeneity by <b>sorting</b> <b>cases</b> into latent but non-arbitrary subgroups {{that are more}} homogeneous. The purpose of this selective review {{is to provide a}} non-technical introduction to mixture modeling in a cross-sectional context. Latent class analysis is used to classify individuals into homogeneous subgroups (latent classes). Factor mixture modeling represents a newer approach that represents a fusion of latent class analysis and factor analysis. Factor mixture models are adaptable to representing categorical and dimensional states of affairs. This article provides an overview of latent variable mixture models and illustrates the application of these methods by applying them {{to the study of the}} latent structure of psychotic experiences. The flexibility of latent variable mixture models makes them adaptable to the study of heterogeneity in complex psychiatric and psychological phenomena. They also allow researchers to address research questions that directly compare the viability of dimensional, categorical and hybrid conceptions of constructs...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that n {{integers}} in the range [1, n c] can be sorted in O(n) time in the RAM model using radix sorting. More generally, integers in any range [1, U] can be sorted in O(n √ log log n) time [5]. However, these algorithms use O(n) words of extra memory. Is this necessary? We present a simple, stable, integer sorting algorithm for words of size O(log n), which works in O(n) time and uses only O(1) words of extra memory on a RAM model. This is the integer <b>sorting</b> <b>case</b> most useful in practice. We extend this result with same bounds to the case when the keys are read-only, which is of theoretical interest. Another interesting question is the case of arbitrary c. Here we present a black-box transformation from any RAM sorting algorithm to a sorting algorithm which uses only O(1) extra space and has the same running time. This settles the complexity of in-place sorting in terms of the complexity of sorting...|$|R
40|$|So the {{question}} naturally arises: {{what kinds of}} sentences belonging to PA’s language LA can we actually establish to be true {{even though they are}} unprovable in PA? There are two familiar classes of cases. First, there are sentences like the canonical Gödel sentence for PA. Second, there are sentences like the arithmetization of Goodstein’s Theorem. In the first <b>sort</b> of <b>case,</b> we can come to appreciate the truth of the Gödelian undecidable sentences by reflecting on PA’s consistency or by coming to accept the instances of the Π 1 reflection schema for PA. And those routes involve deploying ideas beyond those involved in accepting PA as true. To reason to the truth of the Gödel sentence, we need not {{just to be able to}} do basic arithmetic, but to be able to reflect on our practice. In the second <b>sort</b> of <b>case,</b> we come to appreciate the truth of the sentences which are undecidable in PA by deploying transfinite induction or other infinitary ideas.

40|$|Abstract:- The goal of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the significant rules of human body types from the anthropometric data of adult males, using novel two stage-based data mining procedure. The development procedure included two phases. First, cluster analysis was conducted to <b>sort</b> <b>cases</b> into clusters, so that the degree of association is strong between members of the same cluster and weak between members of different clusters. Second, the decision tree uses rules created in accordance with input variables and is executed with data classification by a tree type demonstration to extract the most significant factors and the significant rules based on the results of cluster analysis. Certain advantages may be observed when the significant rules are identified, using two stage-based data mining procedure. Body types could be accurately classified for physiology, medical treatment, sports talent and garment manufacturing according the newly classification rules. The results of this study can provide an effective procedure of identifying the significant rules for classifying human body type to satisfy the demands for industrial and commerce...|$|R
