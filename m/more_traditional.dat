5|$|A second, <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> design {{followed}} {{for the initial}} batch of five unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6230–6234).

Even without the streamlining Type 'B' tenders were distinguishable from Type 'A' by having a slightly different profile at the front and steps and handrails at the rear.|$|E

5|$|During World WarII, tourist travel fell sharply, {{staffing}} was cut, {{and many}} facilities fell into disrepair. By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in Yellowstone and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented Mission66, {{an effort to}} modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned {{to be completed by}} 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style. During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted to the <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> design as well.|$|E

5|$|Functional {{genomics}} using RNAi is {{a particularly}} attractive technique for genomic mapping and annotation in plants because many plants are polyploid, which presents substantial challenges for <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> genetic engineering methods. For example, RNAi has been successfully used for functional genomics studies in bread wheat (which is hexaploid) {{as well as more}} common plant model systems Arabidopsis and maize.|$|E

5|$|St Botolph's Aldersgate {{remains open}} as a {{functioning}} church.
