5|$|After {{working for}} The <b>Mirror</b> <b>for</b> about a year, Hickok {{obtained}} {{a job with}} the Associated Press in 1928, where she became one of the wire service's top correspondents. Her November 1928 story on the sinking of the SS Vestris was published in the New York Times under her own byline, the first woman's byline to appear in the paper. She also reported on the Lindbergh kidnapping and other national events. By 1932, she had become the nation's best-known female reporter.|$|E
5|$|Early {{sources on}} Richard Neville {{fall into two}} categories. The first are the {{sympathetic}} chronicles of the early Yorkist years, or works based on these, such as the <b>Mirror</b> <b>for</b> Magistrates (1559). The other category originates with chronicles commissioned by Edward IV after Warwick's fall, such as the Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV, and take a more negative view of the earl. The Mirror portrayed Warwick as a great man: beloved by the people, and betrayed by the man he helped raise to the throne. The other perspective {{can be found in}} Shakespeare's Henry VI trilogy: a man driven by pride and egotism, who created and deposed kings at will.|$|E
5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} determinations of {{the speed}} of light substituting a rotating <b>mirror</b> <b>for</b> Fizeau's toothed wheel. (Figure2) The apparatus involves light from slit S reflecting off a rotating mirror R, forming an image of the slit on the distant stationary mirror M, which is then reflected back to reform an image of the original slit. If mirror R is stationary, then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's tilt. The situation is different, however, if R is in rapid rotation.|$|E

5|$|The unique {{melting point}} of gallium {{allows it to}} melt in the human hand, and then refreeze if removed. The liquid metal has a strong {{tendency}} to supercool below its melting point/freezing point. Seeding with a crystal helps to initiate freezing. Gallium {{is one of the}} four metals (with caesium, rubidium, and mercury) that are known to be liquid at, or near, normal room temperature. Of the four, gallium {{is the only one that}} is neither highly reactive nor highly toxic and can therefore be used in metal-in-glass high-temperature thermometers. It is also notable for having one of the largest liquid ranges for a metal, and for having (unlike mercury) a low vapor pressure at high temperatures. Gallium's boiling point, 2673K, is more than eight times higher than its melting point on the absolute scale, the greatest ratio between melting point and boiling point of any element. Unlike mercury, liquid gallium metal wets glass and skin, along with most other materials (with the exceptions of quartz, graphite, and Teflon), making it mechanically more difficult to handle even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions. Gallium painted onto glass is a brilliant <b>mirror.</b> <b>For</b> this reason as well as the metal contamination and freezing-expansion problems, samples of gallium metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within other containers.|$|E
