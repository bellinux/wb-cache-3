25|$|In an {{interview}} with Bill Steigerwald in Reason Magazine, Jacobs said that if she is remembered for being a great intellectual she will be remembered not for her work concerning city planning, but for the discovery of import replacement. Critics erroneously claim that her ideas parrot the idea of import substitution advanced earlier by scholars such as Andre Gunder Frank. Import substitution was a national economic theory implying that if a nation substituted its imports with national production the nation would become wealthier, whereas Jacob's idea is entirely about cities and could be called urban import substitution. However, even this would lead to confusion since in practice, import substitution in India and Latin America were government subsidized and mandated, whereas Jacobs' concept of import replacement is a free <b>market</b> <b>process</b> of discovery and division of labor within a city.|$|E

This research investigates the <b>marketing</b> <b>process</b> as implemented by several consumer food product marketers. A model of the <b>marketing</b> <b>process</b> was developed using marketing literature and discussions with academicians. Field interviews with consumer food product marketers were conducted to determine their <b>marketing</b> <b>processes</b> and activities. Interview results reveal that although marketers use the same components of the <b>marketing</b> <b>process</b> model, {{the extent to which}} these components are used varies substantially. Commodity-oriented firms use fifty percent of the model's elements, while marketing-oriented firms use ninety percent. Marketing-oriented firms also use more disaggregated and in-depth data as well as formal analyses in making their marketing decisions. Marketing,...|$|R

2500|$|Trade benefited {{after the}} newly-risen Qing dynasty relaxed {{maritime}} trade restrictions in the 1680s. Taiwan came under Qing control in 1683 and rhetoric regarding the [...] "tributary status" [...] of Europeans was muted. Guangzhou (known as Canton to Europeans) became {{the port of}} preference for incoming foreign trade. Ships did try to call at other ports, but these locations could not match the benefits of Guangzhou's geographic position {{at the mouth of}} the Pearl River, nor did they have Guangzhou's long experience in balancing the demands of Beijing with those of Chinese and foreign merchants. From 1700 onward Canton was the center of maritime trade with China, and this <b>market</b> <b>process</b> became known as the [...] "Canton System". From the systems' inception in 1757, trading in China was extremely lucrative for European and Chinese merchants alike as goods such as tea, porcelain, and silk were valued highly enough in Europe to justify the expenses of traveling to Asia. The system was highly regulated by the Qing government. Foreign traders were only permitted to do business through a body of Chinese merchants known as the Cohong and were forbidden to learn Chinese. Foreigners could only live in one of the Thirteen Factories and were not allowed to enter or trade in any other part of China, a policy the Qing called the Yī kŏu tōngshāng (口通商), or the [...] "Single port commerce system". Only low level government officials could be dealt with, and the imperial court could not be lobbied for any reason excepting official diplomatic missions. The Imperial laws that upheld the system were collectively known as the Prevention Barbarian Ordinances (防范外夷規條.) The Cohong families were particularly powerful in the Old China Trade, as they were tasked with appraising the value of foreign products, purchasing or rebuffing said imports, and tasked with selling Chinese exports at an appropriate price.|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Direct marketing is becoming a key strategy for organisations to develop and maintain strong customer relationships. This method targets specific customers with personalised advertising and promotional campaigns {{in order to help}} organisations increase campaign responses and to get a higher return on their investments. There are, however, many issues related to direct marketing, ranging from the highly technical to the more organisational and managerial aspects. This research focuses on the organisational and managerial issues of the direct <b>marketing</b> <b>process</b> and investigates the stages, activities and technologies required to effectively execute direct marketing. The direct <b>marketing</b> <b>process</b> integrates a complex collection of marketing concepts and business analytics principles, which form an entirely ‘self-contained’ choice for organisations. This makes direct marketing a significantly difficult process to perform. As a result, many scholars have attempted to tackle the complexity of executing the direct <b>marketing</b> <b>process.</b> However, most of their research efforts did not consider an integrated information system platform capable of effectively supporting the direct <b>marketing</b> <b>process.</b> This research attempts to address the above issues by developing a conceptual framework for the Direct <b>Marketing</b> <b>Process</b> with Business Intelligence (DMP-BI). The conceptual framework is developed using the identified marketing concepts and business analytics principles for the direct <b>marketing</b> <b>process.</b> It also proposes Business Intelligence (BI) as an integrated information system platform to effectively execute the direct <b>marketing</b> <b>process.</b> In order to evaluate and illustrate the practicality and impact of the DMP-BI framework, this thesis adopts a case study approach. Three case studies have been carried out in different industries including retailing, telecommunication and higher education. The aim of the case studies is also to demonstrate the usage of the DMP-BI framework within an organisational context. Based on the case studies’ findings, this thesis compares the DMP-BI framework with existing rival methodologies. The comparisons provide clear indications of the DMP-BI framework’s benefits over existing rival methodologies...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the structure of social marketing within a collaboration between non-profit organisations (NPOs) and business organisations as well as whether this collaboration facilitates the <b>process</b> of social <b>marketing</b> for the NPOs. For this purpose, Austin and Seitanidi´s (2012 a, 2012 b, 2014) Collaborative Value Creation (CVC) framework was applied to social marketing as value outcome by combining it with Andreasen and Kotler´s (2003) model of the social <b>marketing</b> <b>process</b> in NPOs. Method: A qualitative study was conducted based on secondary and primary data. Hereby, primary data was gathered from a total of seven NPOs and twelve respondents across Sweden by the use of face-to-face and phone interviews. Result & Conclusions: Two main findings were identified in this study. Firstly, within the <b>process</b> of social <b>marketing</b> in a corporate-NPO collaboration the NPOs predominantly plan and design the campaigns independently. Hereby, it is shown that the NPO´s organisational model of operation influences the collaboration structure. Secondly, it is demonstrated that the corporate-NPO collaboration facilitates the NPOs social <b>marketing</b> <b>process.</b> Suggestions for future research: Further investigations of NPOs could be undertaken by distinguishing between their organisational model and area of operation in order to complement the presented theoretical model of the social <b>marketing</b> <b>process</b> in the corporate-NPO collaboration. Additionally, the perspective of business organisations could be considered. Contribution of the thesis: The present study contributes to literature by providing a theoretical model based of the social <b>marketing</b> <b>process</b> in the corporate-NPO collaboration. It demonstrates that this collaboration facilitates the social <b>marketing</b> <b>process</b> of the NPOs...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Previous studies {{explored}} {{only the}} direct effect of industry, company and trade show strategy influence factors on trade show performance {{and left the}} intervening processes virtually unexplored. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide one of the first empirical tests of the intervening role of trade show <b>marketing</b> <b>processes</b> (pre‐show promotion, at‐show selling, and post‐show follow‐up) in the relationship between resource allocation and performance of trade shows. Design/methodology/approach – This study used the Directory of Chinese Export Commodities Fair Exhibitors as its sampling frame. From this directory, a systematic random sample of 1, 000 firms was drawn. A final total of 444 exhibitor firms fully completed the questionnaires, resulting in a response rate of 44. 4 per cent. The hypotheses were tested by regression analysis, the appropriate procedure for assessing interdependent variables, since trade show <b>marketing</b> <b>processes</b> are interdependent. Findings – The results show that the effect of the resources variables on sales and non‐sales achievement for trade shows were not fully, but rather were partially, mediated by trade show <b>marketing</b> <b>processes.</b> Originality/value – By empirically exploring the notion of partial mediation of the effects of firm resources through trade show <b>marketing</b> <b>processes,</b> this study has opened up a fruitful avenue for future research on trade show marketing...|$|R
