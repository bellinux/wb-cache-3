She recreated commonplace {{objects such as}} TVs, lamps, pencils, erasers, and the painted <b>monochrome</b> <b>reproductions</b> of photographs. A common underlying theme in the paintings was violence or conflict, such as war planes, handguns and riot imagery.

40|$|In the {{national}} economy of the GDR there have been made attempts {{for a number of}} years at passing from unilateral and isolated planning of investments to comprehensive planning of the <b>reproduction</b> <b>process</b> of fixed assets. The paper deals with analysis of this already practically tested method of coaprehensive planning of the <b>reproduction</b> <b>process</b> of fixed assets. The method is based on application of a number of indexes characterizing the <b>reproduction</b> <b>process</b> of fixed assets and serving as a starting point for estimation of reproduction coefficients. These coefficients are in turn linked together to form definite systems allowing for comprehensive analysis of proportionality and effectiveness of fixed assots and their reproduction. There are roughly discussed some methods of determining the scope within which a given coefficient of reproduction can and should be contained, One of these methods - estimation of future, level of the coefficients on tho basis of proportionality ratios within the scope of reproduction - is described in a more detailed manner.

A third, {{more recent}} {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} <b>reproduction</b> <b>process</b> (both the material <b>reproduction</b> <b>processes</b> and the <b>reproduction</b> of capital) has become completely dominated by capital finance. Hence, to explain economic crises, critical disproportions between the developments of branches of production, or unutilized capacity ought {{to be viewed as}} emerging out of specific financial and monetary regimes pursued by financial institutions and the state. The large funds commanded by these organizations are thought to shape the whole character of the <b>reproduction</b> <b>process.</b> As analysts like Michael Hudson like to point out, ordinary consumers in developed countries today have little in common anymore with how economists portray them in their models, because in reality consumers are using the majority of what they earn to pay interest, premiums, rent and debt principal to the financial industry (finance, insurance and real estate). Consumers spend less than a quarter or less than 20% of their earnings on actual goods and services. Just as Marx noted a progression from natural economy to a [...] "money-economy" [...] and then a [...] "credit economy", it is argued that the <b>reproduction</b> <b>process</b> has now become dominated by the supply, demand, or withdrawal of credit-money. However, there is much theoretical controversy about exactly how the relationship between the [...] "real economy" [...] (the direct involvement with the production and consumption of goods and services) and the [...] "financial economy" [...] (the circuit of trade in financial claims) should be understood. There is not much consensus about the effects of different financial policies by government and business on the economy, or how one could prove what the effects are.|$|R
