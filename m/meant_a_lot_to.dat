5|$|Reaching {{a career}} milestone, Suter played in his 1,000th NHL game on October 25, 2000, scoring a goal in a 3–1 {{victory over the}} Columbus Blue Jackets. He said the {{achievement}} <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> him given both the ailments he overcame {{and that he was}} dismissed by critics as unlikely to play in the NHL when he was drafted in 1984. Suter finished the regular season with 34 points, but missed nearly the entire playoffs after suffering a concussion in the Sharks' first post-season game.|$|E
500|$|When portraying Trevor, Ogg cites Tom Hardy's {{depiction}} of English criminal Charles Bronson in the 2008 biopic Bronson {{as a strong}} stylistic influence on his portrayal of Trevor. Ogg reflected that while Trevor embodies the violent, psychopathic Grand Theft Auto anti-hero archetype, he wanted players to sympathise with Trevor's story. [...] "To elicit other emotions was tough, {{and it was the}} biggest challenge and it's something that <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> me," [...] Ogg said.|$|E

The films did play theatrically in France in 1969 and Hellman said they were hits, with The Shooting playing for a year in Paris and Ride in the Whirlwind playing for six months. Hellman stated that in the late sixties it <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> in Hollywood <b>to</b> be lionized in France and thus Hellman had a brief time of being very much in demand in Hollywood.|$|R
500|$|Miss Rosa {{suffers from}} cancer but refuses {{to let her}} illness define her. Rosenblat {{believed}} that her character's attitude resonated with viewers and she received letters of thanks from the audience and later recalled that one such letter, from a sixteen-year-old viewer <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> her. Her storyline helped him understand elements of his grandmother's cancer he could not grasp. Rosenblat said that these such stories relating to Miss Rosa left her [...] "touched and moved".|$|E
500|$|Ogg felt Trevor's {{characterisation}} {{developed over}} time. He said, [...] "Nuances and character traits {{that began to}} appearhis walk, his manner of speech, his reactions, definitely informed his development throughout the game". Ogg cites Tom Hardy's portrayal of English criminal Charles Bronson in the 2008 biopic Bronson as a strong stylistic influence. He opined that while Trevor embodies the violent, psychopathic Grand Theft Auto anti-hero archetype, he wanted to evoke player sympathy to Trevor's story. [...] "To elicit other emotions was tough, {{and it was the}} biggest challenge and it's something that <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> me", Ogg explained. Fonteno felt that growing up in South Los Angeles and being exposed to drug trafficking and gang culture authenticated his portrayal of Franklin. [...] "I lived his life before...He's been surrounded by drugs, the crime, living with his auntI lived with my grandmotherso {{there was a lot of}} familiarity", Fonteno said. Having not worked as an actor since portraying Face in the 2001 film The Wash, he sought counsel from Luke and Ogg to refine his acting skills.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher broke into tears when asked if matching Ayrton Senna's number of victories <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> him. He later regained his composure and spoke about {{how important it was}} to maintain the life of the engine at the circuit. Michael Schumacher revealed that the cause of his emotion was of him thinking about Senna's death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix and said that he was surprised at how the media reacted to the moment which said that Schumacher [...] "was human after all". Häkkinen revealed that his team made modifications to his car at his pit stop which contributed to him setting the fastest lap of the race. He also admitted that he was unable to catch Michael Schumacher due to the presence of the two Minardis which cost him time. Ralf Schumacher said he was not worried from being challenged by Verstappen and Zonta during the event because of the Williams's quick pace. He also was confident that Williams had confirmed itself as the third strongest team in Formula One.|$|E
500|$|... "Kissing You" [...] {{was covered}} by American R singer Beyoncé under the title [...] "Still in Love (Kissing You)", later {{replaced}} with other track [...] "If". Beyoncé's rendition was included on the 2007 deluxe edition of her second studio album, B'Day. Beyoncé contributed to the writing and production processes, {{and it was one}} of the last tracks to be added to the album. She called the song [...] "a beautiful ballad" [...] and said, [...] "I've always loved [...] It gives you this emotion – I don't care who you are, you just feel it.

40|$|In my work I process my {{development}} of vocal technique {{and how it}} was affecting me during my artistic project "My home - a way back" with director Mira Bartov.

I discuss and analyze in this work from my process diary, which has been continuously during the work and the methods (sound recording and video filming) come to the tools I use to develop in the best way. My intention with this work has been that in the future I {{will be able to use}} this work and the different types of documentation, which I have used both in the singing room so that on stage. I pay attention to my strengths and weaknesses and educators help adapt the vocal technique exercises and mental settings for these properties to be processed adequately. I have chosen to refer to the book: The inner voice - The Making of a Singer by Renée Fleming which I have found similarities with myself in the description she has in her book both on a vocally and musically plan. The choice to use this book as a starting point to the work has been that it puts into words <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of my experiences and approaches that I can relate to. This book has been formulated in a way that others can partake observations and tips author writes about.

500|$|Also in 2000, she {{appeared}} in Waking the Dead, a film based on the 1986 novel of the same name, playing Sarah Williams, an activist killed by a car bomb in Minneapolis while she was driving Chilean refugees (Strangely, Sarah Williams was also the name of Connelly's character in Labyrinth). Initially, director Keith Gordon was reluctant to cast Connelly in this role as he did not consider her a serious actress. Her agent Risa Shapiro persuaded him to watch Connelly's performance in Far Harbor. Gordon later said: [...] "There was a subtlety and depth even to her gaze that captured more of the relationship than I ever could have hoped for." [...] About her role, Connelly said, [...] "Waking the Dead was the first film I worked on where whatever I did felt like my own thing. I was really trying {{to make something of}} the part and threw myself into it, so that <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> me". The New York Times described her performance, [...] "As Sarah, Ms. Connelly captures a burning ethereality and willfulness that are very much of the period. And she and Mr. Crudup connect powerfully in love scenes that convey the fierce tenderness of a relationship whose passion carries a tinge of religious fervor." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{effects of}} the group's charity single, [...] "Never Had a Dream Come True", were felt when the group handed over £200,000 to Children in Need, from the sales of the CD {{after the release of}} [...] "Don't Stop Movin'" [...] in April 2001. As a result, S Club 7 were invited back and asked to record a second {{consecutive}} Children in Need single, in November 2001. It was decided that [...] "Have You Ever", a song co-written by Chris Braide and Cathy Dennis, was to be released for the charity campaign. After the success of the previous year's single, the performance on the night featured many primary school children who had pre-recorded their own versions of the chorus, including the S Club Juniors who they made their first television appearance. The band felt [...] "overjoyed" [...] that they could, once again, contribute to the Children in Need campaign, feeling that it <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> them to be involved and feeling privileged to be able to help; they also commented that it was nice for British school children to be involved in raising money for charity. The single was another success for the group and became their fourth number-one, as well as the 21st biggest selling single of 2001.|$|E
500|$|At {{least one}} {{historian}} has noted a tradition, by then, of newly-crowned kings of England launching military campigns {{at the beginning}} of their reigns. Edward III had done so the same year his reign commenced; Richard II immediately on reaching his majority, and Henry V would do so within three years. These campaigns have been summarised as [...] "enforcing....royal will and testing loyalty towards a newly established regime" [...] as well as for established strategic goals. Although it has been suggested that Henry 'hoped to maintain peaceful relations' with the Scots, elements among the English nobility were not averse to a pre-emptive strike, either. In particular the Percys – the Earl of Northumberland and his son Henry Percy (called 'Hotspur') – who were Wardens of the East and West March, saw a Scottish war as an opportunity for their own dynastic aggrandisement. Indeed, some contemporaries believed that the invasion was actually instigated by them; the King was forced to deny it, in person, to the sitting parliament in November 1399. A.L. Brown has suggested that this indicates the personal interest the King felt in the affair: that this was in fact his own personal plan, and 'that it <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> him, and that it had met with criticism.' He pledged to fulfil this vow before god. At almost the same time, Henry had received a letter from the Scottish king in which Henry was referred to as duke of Lancaster rather than king of England; this, it has been suggested, fuelled his martial enthusiasm towards Scotland.|$|E

Additionally, since its debut, it has achieved strong media attention. In 2009, prior to the election results, Barack Obama's wife Michelle played him the song to give him strength and inner support. A source close to Carey claimed that hearing the song's use <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> her, saying [...] "She was blown away when she heard. She is so honoured to have played her part in such an occasion." [...] At the 1994 Essence Awards, Aretha Franklin performed a live rendition of the song {{as a tribute to}} The Reverend Jesse Jackson. In 2001, Neal Schon performed an instrumental version on the album Voice. Filipino singers Regine Velasquez and Sarah Geronimo both performed the song live on television, with the former playing a medley of the song alongside Carey's [...] "Anytime You Need a Friend". International male operatic pop group Il Divo included the Spanish version of the song on their second studio album, Ancora (2005). Australian singer and actress Natalie Bassingthwaighte performed a live version of the song at the Rugby League World Cup Heroes 08 Campaign. Michael Ball, British singer, actor and radio personality, covered [...] "Hero" [...] for his album titled One Voice (2006). In 1994, Japanese singer Miho Nakayama released the song as a single with Japanese lyrics written by herself and became a big hit. American Idol season 5 contestant Heather Cox performed the song during the top 20 performances week, only to be voted off that night {{for not being able to}} successfully carry the song. Similarly, season 7 contestant Brooke White performed the song during the Mariah Carey themed week, while season 8 contestant Danny Gokey performed the song in the top 36 performances. season 10 contestant Karen Rodriguez performed the song in both English and Spanish versions in the top 24 performances, making it into the top 13 the following night.

500|$|Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) – Victor is {{the main}} protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself {{constantly}} battling against all that life throws {{at him as he}} becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name [...] "Victor" [...] was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser. From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after his infamous replacement by a [...] "box" [...] at his place of employment, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite façade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. [...] "Victor-isms" [...] include [...] "I do not believe it!", [...] "I don't believe it!", [...] "Un-be-lievable!", [...] "What in the name of bloody hell?", [...] "In the name of sanity!". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassionin [...] "Hearts of Darkness" [...] he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in [...] "Descent Into The Maelstrom" [...] he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 38 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says [...] "You were always my first choice", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode [...] "The Wisdom of the Witch" [...] in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, {{out the window of the}} house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.|$|E

2500|$|Yamaguchi wrote new {{lyrics to}} the song, {{and felt like}} the song mixed his past self with his present self. He {{inserted}} many lyrical gimmicks into the song's lyrics, such as hiding the album's title Kikuuiki in the lyric [...] This gimmick was the reason that Yamaguchi decided to capitalize the two central letters of the album title (kikUUiki). Yamaguchi felt that the lyrics he wrote were like a first-person novel, using lyrical techniques {{that he had not}} personally experimented with before. He wrote the lyrics abstractly, using words that <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> Yamaguchi personally that would not mean anything to outside listeners.
