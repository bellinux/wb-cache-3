40|$|The {{emulation}} of {{the real-world}} of <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> <b>cables</b> in EMC test methods can be improved. We show that for devices with significant differential-mode emission {{in the frequency}} range 150 kHz to 30 MHz, the impedance balance of the mains cable should be specified, even when the actual measurement is of data cable emission. For the same reasons radiated emission testing between 30 MHz and 200 MHz may be seriously in error. Neither the proposed CDNE-M (Coupler Decoupler Network for Emission - Mains) or the CMAD (Common-Mode Attenuation Device) captures the real-world interference due to DM {{because they do not}} model the DM to CM conversion and reflection at points remote from the EUT. It is recommended that the development of Standards should assume that one-tenth of mains-cable DM is converted to CM. An appropriate small modification to the CDNE-M design is presented...|$|R

50|$|The TOD clock's {{internal}} circuitry {{is designed to}} be driven by either 50 or 60 Hz clock signal, which can be inexpensively derived from the <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> source AC, resulting in a stable timekeeper with little long-term drift. The ability to work with both power line frequencies allowed a single version of the 6526 to be used in computers operated in countries with either 50 or 60 Hz <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> lines. It {{is important to note that}} contrary to the popular belief, NTSC or PAL video standards are not directly linked to <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> frequency. Additionally, some computers did not derive their TOD clock frequency from the <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> source. For example, both NTSC and PAL variants of Commodore SX-64 use 60 Hz TOD clock supplied by a dedicated crystal. KERNAL operating system in Commodore 64 for example will determine the video standard during system startup, but tries neither to identify the supplied TOD clock frequency nor to initialise the CIAs correctly on 50 Hz driven machines. Thus, it is the responsibility of any application software that wants to use either CIA's TOD function to determine the supplied frequency and set the CIA(s) flag accordingly itself. Failure to do so may cause the clock to deviate quickly from the correct time.|$|R
