Resource partitioning {{is useful for}} a number of applications, including virtual private subnetworks, advance reservation of real-time network services, fast establishment of real-time connections and support for mobile computing with real-time communication. We propose a scheme where resource partitioning requires extra computation only at the connection establishment time and where the per-packet scheduling and rate control does not require any extra work for supporting resource partitioning.

This paper demonstrates StateSync, an abstraction for reliable dissemination of application state through a multi-hop wireless network. Using StateSync, the complexity of multihop wireless network applications and services {{can be reduced to}} processing a gradually evolving set of table entries, subject to minimal consistency checks. The StateSync abstraction defines a data model based on key-value pairs, a reliability model with a probabilistic latency bound, and an event-driven publish/subscribe API. We evaluate StateSync using three different applications. We present performance measurements using simulation and a wireless testbed. 1. THE STATESYNC ABSTRACTION As {{the field of}} embedded networked sensing matures, useful abstractions are emerging to satisfy the needs of increasingly complex applications. This paper demonstrates StateSync, an abstraction for reliable dissemination of application state through a multi-hop wireless network. The StateSync layer presents a publish/subscribe interface to a set of application-defined tables. The contents of these tables are reliably and efficiently broadcasted a specified number of hops away, using a protocol that is robust to changes to the network topology and changes in the receiver set.

40|$|One of {{the terms}} of {{reference}} of the Thirteenth Finance Commission (ThFC) calls upon the Finance Commission to look at ‘Measures needed to augment the consolidated fund of a State to supplement the resources of the Panchayats and Municipalities in the State {{on the basis of the}} recommendations made by the Finance Commission of the State’. In view of this, the present study examines issues related to fiscal federalism at the third tier in general and grants to local bodies in particular. It is well documented in the literature that the state of finances of local bodies, both urban and rural, displays a dismal picture in India. In contrast, the finances of the Central and State Governments are on a healthier track with the implementation of the rule based fiscal framework. The study opines that there is a need to fine tune the <b>micro</b> design of <b>grants</b> for local bodies (both urban and local) and their devolution across the States. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{aimed to}} explore the {{contribution}} of a <b>micro</b> <b>grant</b> financing scheme to community action in terms of residential health-promoting initiatives, interorganizational collaboration and public participation. The scheme was two-fold, consisting of (i) micro grants of 500 - 3500 Euros, which were easily obtainable by local organizations and (ii) neighbourhood health panels of community and health workers, functioning as a distributing mechanism. Data were collected using three methods: (i) observations of the neighbourhood-based health panels, (ii) in-depth interviews with policy-makers and professionals and (iii) analyses of documents and reports. This study demonstrated the three-fold role of micro grants {{as a vehicle to}} enable community action at an organizational level in terms of increased network activities between the local organizations, to set an agenda for the 'health topic' in non-traditional health agencies and to enable a number of health-promoting initiatives. Although these initiatives were attended by small groups of residents normally considered hard to reach, the actual public participation was limited. In their role as a distributing mechanism, the health panels were vital with regard to the achieved impact on the community action. However, certain limitations were also seen, which were related to the governance of the panels. This case study provides evidence to suggest that micro grants have the potential to stimulate community action at an organizational and a residential level, but with the prerequisite that grants be accompanied by increased investments in infrastructur...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Contained {{under the}} {{umbrella}} 'Project 2061,' the central framework for the modernization of science education, "science literacy for all Americans," was introduced by the American Academy for the Advancement of Science in 1989. More than twenty years later these recommendations remain widely cited yet, with federal accountability efforts focused almost singularly on high stakes testing, little has been accomplished on a national level. In response, local entities have become hotbeds of innovation, their successes resonating up to create the definable and thus fundable fields of Informal Science Education (ISE) and Science Technology Engineering Art and Mathematics (STEAM). The Bay Area is one such hotbed, home to the Maker Fair, the Exploratorium, innovative charter schools, and more. However, few of these options provide opportunities for technoethical explorations grounded in student creativity, and even fewer are directly available within the day-to-day curriculum of public schools. Alongside, community-supported efforts {{have been used to}} restore arts education to several local school districts. The stage is set to meld these approaches into a model project in Sonoma County. Procedure: Through a pilot curriculum project, community presentations, and coalition building within both the public and private sectors, this project has sought to assemble the necessary support to envision a first ever "Science is Creative Fair" in Sonoma County. An innovation able to fit within current nationwide standards, a successful future grant application would allow the program to develop into a workable national model. iv Findings: Interest exists amongst current Sonoma County public high school teachers in community supported pathways to enrich their science classrooms, especially options which involve clear lines of support and which seek to not add significantly to their current workload. Teenagers are fully capable of following art/science/design projects to logical conclusions and are eager to investigate ways in which they can help shape their own identities, neighborhoods, and world-conservations which they feel are all too often left out of their current education. Communities are especially receptive to supporting student efforts, including volunteers to help create, display, and celebrate student work. For many adults, the lack of time to reflect and explore in their own schooling (and their resultant disinterest in science) was cited as the key factor in their desire to support the founding of a "Science is Creative Fair" today. Conclusions: In the coming years, all three essential elements of the "Creative Avenues for Student Response" umbrella appear feasible. 1) Teachers have been identified from at least four local area public high schools who wish to participate in a pilot program. 2) Local businesses have offered to host, award, and display student projects. 3) Volunteer mentors exist {{in the form of an}} ongoing mailing list and a potential service learning course at Sonoma State University. Financially, partnerships with the traditional science fair, the Children's Museum of Sonoma County, and the Share Exchange could help defray some costs. A <b>micro</b> scale <b>grant</b> may be enough to begin, however, with a recent funding emphasis on Informal Science Education at the NSF, the potential exists for a larger, more development scale grant as well...|$|R
