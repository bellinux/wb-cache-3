40|$|AbstractAn {{extension}} {{of a novel}} optimization approach for the determination of accessible output sets of planar manipulators is presented. The optimization approach provides a general method for the determination of workspaces and has the advantage that it allows for the easy and systematic implementation of constraints acting on manipulators. The previously proposed optimization methodologies, the ray method and modified ray method, were unable to map the boundaries of nonconvex planar workspaces automatically. A new <b>chord</b> <b>method</b> is proposed in this paper, which allows for the efficient and automated mapping of most nonconvex workspaces. The <b>chord</b> <b>method</b> is illustrated by application to three degree of freedom planar parallel manipulators of varied geometry. In particular, as an extreme test and illustration of its capability, the <b>chord</b> <b>method</b> is also applied to manipulators exhibiting redundant behavior...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Large {{flexible}} roof diaphragms sheathed with oriented strand {{board or}} plywood panels are very common in the United States, in particular for multi-family residential buildings and large-scale commercial buildings. A traditional diaphragm design method has been the preferred design method for practitioners due to the simplicity in the design assumption, in which the axial forces developed in framing members under in-plane loading {{are assumed to be}} carried only by the perimeter <b>chords.</b> This design <b>method</b> has always been thought to be a conservative approach, especially when applied to large diaphragms. Over past few years, members of the engineering community began to question the applicability of this traditional diaphragm design method. A new design approach known as the collective <b>chord</b> design <b>method</b> was proposed to analyse the chord forces for large flexible roof diaphragms incorporating intermediate continuity ties. This <b>method</b> assumes intermediate <b>chord</b> members are available to participate in carrying lateral load and it utilizes strain compatibility of a simple beam to estimate the axial forces in these intermediate chord members. The end chord forces estimated using a traditional method could be significantly higher than that of the collective <b>chord</b> <b>method,</b> especially for very large diaphragms. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the applicability of the traditional and collective <b>chord</b> design <b>methods</b> and provide recommendations to practitioners on the estimation of design chord forces...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{determine}} whether continuity ties in large wood diaphragms are stiff enough to engage and provide diaphragm flexural stiffness in a collective chord model. Four series of continuity tie assemblies using Simpson Strong-Tie steel connectors were tested to determine the stiffness of each assembly. The results found from testing were applied to an example building and then analyzed using both the traditional <b>chord</b> <b>method</b> and the collective <b>chord</b> <b>method.</b> The completed analysis on a typical size warehouse building showed that the collective chord model will act inadvertently on an existing building designed with a traditional chord, or alternatively will potentially act intentionally {{in the design of}} a new building. The relative stiffness of the continuity ties will determine if they engage and allow them to act collectively. The testing and analysis completed creates a basis for further research into the actual static and dynamic behavior of these diaphragms. The collective chord model does seem to be a reasonable approximation for how diaphragms actually behave. If more research is conducted into different shaped and sized buildings to confirm that the collective chord model will work on most buildings then it will be a more accurate way to design new diaphragms and analyze existing diaphragms than the current traditional model...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} Stewart {{platforms}} have been increasingly studied and developed. These parallel manipulators offer {{a number of}} advantages over traditional serial manipulators including high rigidity, good positioning accuracy and high load to weight ratio. The main disadvantage associated with parallel manipulators {{is that they have}} relatively limited workspaces. Numerous researchers have thus emphasized the need to develop refined methods for the determination of workspaces of such manipulators. This study is primarily concerned with extensions to a novel optimization approach for the determination of manipulator accessible output sets. The optimization approach provides a general method for the determination of workspaces of both serial and parallel manipulators and has the considerable advantage that it may easily be automated. Furthermore, the approach allows for the easy and systematic implementation of various physical constraints acting on manipulators. Established methods for workspace determination are reviewed and illustrated by application to a simple two degree of freedom example. The original optimization approach is extended and generalize< to enable the determination of non-convex workspaces. Simply stated, the approach consists of finding the points of intersection of the workspace boundary with a number of successive search elements. The points of intersection are determined by means of optimization techniques in which a dynamic constrained optimization algorithm is used. Two new methodologies, the modified ray <b>method</b> and the <b>chord</b> <b>method,</b> are proposed. Differences between these methods are illustrated using a simple example. The optimization approach, embodied in the proposed methodologies, is applied to the determination of workspaces of planar Stewart platforms of varied designs. A formulation for all constraints acting on planar Stewart platforms is introduced and implemented in the optimization approach. A special case of manipulator geometry, where the orientation of the platform is effectively redundant in determining the extreme reach of the manipulat' 1 r, is identified and studied. A slight modification to the optimization methodologies is introduced to allow for the determination of workspaces of such redundant manipulators. The modified ray and <b>chord</b> <b>methods</b> proposed in this study have proven capable of determining convex and non-convex manipulator workspaces. Of the two new <b>methods,</b> the <b>chord</b> approach is the most reliable in determining non-convex workspaces.
