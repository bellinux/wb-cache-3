5|$|His {{studies had}} {{impressed}} the Lucasian professor Isaac Barrow, who was <b>more</b> <b>anxious</b> {{to develop his}} own religious and administrative potential (he became master of Trinity two years later); in 1669 Newton succeeded him, only one year after receiving his MA. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} in New York, Mary finds that Jacqueline sold her cosmetics business eight months earlier. Jacqueline's {{close friend and}} former employee, Frances Fallon (Isabel Jewell), claims to have seen Jacqueline the week before, and suggests that Mary visit Dante's, an Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village. Mary locates the restaurant, and discovers that Jacqueline has rented a room above the store, without having moved in. Mary convinces the owners to let her see the room, which she finds empty aside from a wooden chair and above it a noose hanging from the ceiling. This makes Mary <b>more</b> <b>anxious</b> and determined to find her sister.|$|E
25|$|Infertility {{may have}} {{profound}} psychological effects. Partners may become <b>more</b> <b>anxious</b> to conceive, increasing sexual dysfunction. Marital discord often develops in infertile couples, {{especially when they}} are under pressure to make medical decisions. Women trying to conceive often have clinical depression rates similar to women who have heart disease or cancer. Even couples undertaking IVF face considerable stress.|$|E

25|$|It {{was then}} that he joined the All-England Eleven, playing his first game for them at Newark-on-Trent. This meant Caesar would now tour the country, playing cricket, and {{receiving}} somewhere between £4 and £6 from Clarke, from which he {{would also have to}} pay his expenses. Caesar's form dropped, which would have made him <b>more</b> <b>anxious</b> about his place, and he got up to some strange antics at hotels. He became irrationally nervous fearing that someone may have died in his bed, or that the hotel would burn down. One time, after yells from a drunkard outside, Caesar convinced himself that there was a fire and rang the alarm bell, causing minor panic amongst the other guests.|$|E
25|$|If the muster-roll of Laudonnière is accurate, the {{garrison}} which Ribault left behind him to defend Fort Caroline was ill-fitted to resist {{an attack of}} the well-fed and well-disciplined Spanish soldiery. The total number of colonists remaining in the fort was about two hundred and forty. Three days passed without any news of Ribault, and {{with each passing day}} Laudonnière became <b>more</b> <b>anxious.</b> Knowing the proximity of the Spaniards, and dreading a sudden descent upon the fort, he resolved to make shift for his own defense. Although food stores were depleted, as Ribault had carried off two of his boats with the meal which had been left over after making the biscuit for the return to France, and although Laudonnière himself was reduced to the rations of a common soldier, he yet commanded the allowance to be increased in order to lift the morale of his men. He also set to work to repair the palisade which had been torn down to supply material for the ships, but continued storms hindered the work, which was never completed.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, as Pixies were {{recording}} Trompe le Monde, Albini {{described his}} impressions of Pixies during {{the recording of}} Surfer Rosa to the fan magazine Forced Exposure: [...] "A patchwork pinch loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock. Their willingness to be 'guided' by their manager, their record company and their producers is unparalleled. Never have I seen four cows <b>more</b> <b>anxious</b> to be led around by their nose rings." [...] Albini later apologized for his remarks, saying, [...] "to this day I regret having done it. I don't think that I regarded the band as significantly as I should have." ...|$|E

500|$|During the Rhodesian Cabinet {{meeting on}} the proposals, the judges were kept {{informed}} by the [...] "expression on Sir Hugh's face and from comments of increasing despair", Goldin later wrote; the Chief Justice [...] "spent the whole day in his chambers looking <b>more</b> <b>anxious</b> and despondent after each occasion on which he was smuggled into the Cabinet meeting to explain the meaning or effect of particular provisions". On 5 December 1966, when Beadle heard at Government House that Smith's ministers had rejected the terms, he stood [...] "as though pole-axed", Gibbs's Private Secretary Sir John Pestell recalled, and appeared close to collapse. The judge's wife and daughter helped him to slowly return to his room.|$|E
500|$|The episode's action {{revolves}} around the practical joke involving the cake and, in particular, viewers' attempts to guess what has caused injury, as {{they know that the}} paramedic will be coming. Both Angela and the alcoholic Carol are [...] "ticking time-bomb". Angela is the central character, and is similar to a <b>more</b> <b>anxious</b> version of Sue Brockman, Skinner's character from Outnumbered. She is stressed and obsessive-compulsive, but aspirational, fastidious, and dutiful. The comedy critic Bruce Dessau compared Ashbourne's characterisation of Carol to Elizabeth Taylor's characterisation in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?; as the episode progresses, Carol becomes increasingly abusive. Commentators variously described Pat as [...] "appalling", [...] "tiresome", an [...] "irritating tit" [...] and [...] "an insufferable booby". For Chris Bennion, writing in The Independent, Pat's character is more complex: [...] "Behind Pat's cheesy jokes and schoolboy tomfoolery lies a desperately sad and dignified man, standing by and caring for a wife whose love for him has long gone." [...] Pat and Carol, for Pemberton and Shearsmith, have a more honest relationship than Jim and Angela, despite the problems in their relationship.|$|E
2500|$|The {{normally}} neutral Hong Kong Bar Association, an organisation representing barristers, {{has also}} {{stepped into the}} fray: Bar Association chairman Alan Leong has publicly said: [...] "The more you read into this document, the <b>more</b> <b>anxious</b> and concerned you get. There are some glaring ambiguities".|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear, I {{sometimes}} fancy I am a hypercritical old fogey!" [...] he said, {{and sighed}} a little, while once <b>more</b> the <b>anxious</b> look crept into his face. [...] "Just now I wish devoutly I {{was a better}} business man." ...|$|R
50|$|The film, {{especially}} Woodward's {{definition of}} a microlight as 'a chainsaw attached to a deckchair', sparked heated debate within the microlighting fraternity between the 'nutters or eccentrics' {{on one side and}} the <b>more</b> serious-minded, <b>anxious</b> to demonstrate the credibility of the sport, on the other.|$|R
2500|$|By late August Wakefield {{realised}} Spain's {{findings were}} likely to be unfavourable to the company and wrote to the commissioner and offered to make cash payments to Maori who had missed out on payments in 1839. Spain had already {{come to the conclusion that}} Maori at Te Aro, Kumutoto, Pipitea and Kaiwharawhara pā had had no intention of selling their pā, cultivations and burial grounds and would not now move, and that reserves allotted them by the company, mainly on hilly ground, were unsuitable. Spain considered the offer of a further cash payment to be reasonable, explaining that [...] "the natives who denied the sale seemed to be <b>more</b> <b>anxious</b> to obtain payment for their land than to dispossess the settlers then in occupation of it". He thought giving land back to the Maori was impractical because Wellington's population had grown to about 3000, outnumbering Maori by at least five to one.|$|E
2500|$|Era Extraña has {{the same}} lazy summer vibe as Psychic Chasms, but with a more serious and {{slightly}} darker tone. In a PopMatters review, Nathan Wisnicki said that Palomo's [...] "introversion is certainly apparent, and even the record's sprightliest melodies are rigidly grafted to both rhythmic thrust and hooks <b>more</b> <b>anxious</b> than comfortable". Pitchfork's Larry Fitzmaurice said that the album is much more serious than Psychic Chasms, but [...] "Palomo isn't always as assured in rendering the darker material". He also noted that while it wasn't exactly a breakup album, it did sound [...] "romantic and lovesick" [...] and uses sounds that emulate these feelings. At the same time, the album also feels [...] "expansive and lonely, like someone staring at the night sky in solitude". Era Extraña also contains the same unsteady synth riffs, filtered drums and vocal hooks as Psychic Chasms, {{with the addition of}} crunchy, fuzzy guitars; thick analog synths; and a lot of reverb, as well as much clearer production.|$|E
2500|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that in utero cocaine exposure leads to problems with behavior and sustained attention, possibly by affecting {{parts of the brain}} that are vulnerable to toxins during fetal development. School-age PCE children have been found to have trouble regulating their behavior and sustaining their attention. Children who had been exposed to high levels of cocaine in utero show poorer behavioral inhibition than those with lower levels of exposure or unexposed children. The changes in behavior and attention caused by PCE are measurable by standardized scales; however these behavioral effects seem to be mild. [...] Children exposed to cocaine in the first trimester are less sociable, more withdrawn, and show <b>more</b> <b>anxious</b> and depressed behaviors. Those exposed to higher doses of cocaine have been reported to show aggressive and disruptive behaviors. PCE girls are seven {{times more likely to have}} delinquent behavioral problems, but PCE boys are no more likely than other boys.|$|E

60|$|On the {{day before}} the grand reception, Governor Roosevelt, with some members of his staff, called upon Admiral Dewey on board of the Olympia, and offered the State's greeting.

2500|$|Starting in mid-March 1939, the Soviet Union, Britain and France traded {{a flurry}} of {{suggestions}} and counterplans regarding a potential political and military agreement. [...] The Soviet Union feared Western powers {{and the possibility of}} a [...] "capitalist encirclements", had little faith either that war could be avoided or in the Polish army, and wanted guaranteed support for a two-pronged attack on Germany. Britain and France believed that war could still be avoided and that the Soviet Union, weakened by purges, could not serve as a main military participant. [...] France, as a continental power, was <b>more</b> <b>anxious</b> for an agreement with the USSR than Britain, which was more willing to make concessions and more aware of the dangers of an agreement between the USSR and Germany. [...] On April 17, Soviet foreign minister Maxim Litvinov outlined a French–British–Soviet mutual assistance pact between the three powers for five to 10 years, including military support, if any of the powers were the subject of aggression.|$|E
2500|$|They met, {{together}} with Viviani (French Prime Minister) and Millerand (now French War Minister). Huguet recorded that Kitchener was [...] "calm, balanced, reflective" [...] while Sir John was [...] "sour, impetuous, with congested face, sullen and ill-tempered". On Bertie's advice Kitchener dropped his intention of inspecting the BEF. They {{moved to a}} separate room, and no independent account of the meeting exists. French admitted that Kitchener had taken exception to his tone, {{and that he had}} assured him that this was simply in his mind. In his diary Sir John wrote [...] "we had rather a disagreeable time. I think K found he was making a mistake". In 1914 French later claimed that he had told Kitchener that although he valued his [...] he would not tolerate any interference in his executive authority so long as he remained in command, and that they [...] "finally came to an amicable understanding". Terraine dismisses as absurd Sir John's later claims that he resented being called away from GHQ (given that no battle was in progress, and that he had played little directing part in either of the two battles fought so far), and that an inspection of the BEF (by Kitchener, Britain's most celebrated soldier at the time) might have disheartened the men by the implied challenge to French's authority. Terraine suggests that Sir John was <b>more</b> <b>anxious</b> to prevent Kitchener from inspecting the BEF as he might have seen for himself that they were less [...] "shattered" [...] than he claimed, and that Haig and Smith-Dorrien might have criticised him if given a chance to speak privately to Kitchener. After the meeting Kitchener telegraphed the Cabinet that the BEF would remain in the line, although taking care not to be outflanked, and told French to consider this [...] "an instruction". French had a friendly exchange of letters with Joffre.|$|E

60|$|It was, indeed, {{with that}} {{agitating}} {{state of mind}} which arises partly from horror, but <b>more</b> from <b>anxious</b> interest and curiosity, that young Graeme found himself actually traversing the scene of those tremendous events, the report of which had disturbed the most distant solitudes in Scotland, like the echoes of distant thunder rolling among the mountains.|$|R
50|$|A {{prospective}} study found average differences across {{a range of}} developmental domains, including reaching milestones of motor development at a later age, having more speech problems, lower educational test results, solitary play preferences at ages four and six, and being <b>more</b> socially <b>anxious</b> at age 13. Lower ratings of the mother's skills and understanding of the child at age 4 were also related.|$|R
50|$|Motivation moderates the BFLPE. More highly {{motivated}} students typically experience stronger BFLPE. Whether the student’s motivation was extrinsic or intrinsic does not matter. The BFLPE is typically more pronounced {{for students who}} are more intelligent, who are <b>more</b> highly <b>anxious,</b> who have a cooperative orientation, or who use memorization as a learning strategy. However, the moderating effects of these variables are relatively small.|$|R

Finally they spoke to Mopsey about it, for they thought the curiosity of their expected patrons should be satisfied.|$|R
