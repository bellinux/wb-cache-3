A special primary to fill his vacated congressional seat was held on March 3, 2009, and the special general election on April 7. John Fritchey, a candidate for that seat, said at a forum that Emanuel had told him he <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in running for the seat again in the future.|$|E
5|$|Stelmach {{clashed with}} rural landowners again in 2009 when his {{government}} introduced the Land Assembly Project Area Act, {{designed to make}} it easier for the government to acquire large blocks of land for public purposes such as ring roads or reservoirs. The Act allowed the government to identify land that it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in expropriating at some point in the future and to indefinitely prohibit any development on that land that could conflict with the government's purposes. Despite vigorous opposition from landowners and the opposition parties, the bill passed the legislature in late April.|$|E

25|$|Amateur Microscopy is the {{investigation}} and observation of biological and non-biological specimens for recreational purposes. Collectors of minerals, insects, seashells, and plants may use microscopes as tools to uncover features that help them classify their collected items. Other amateurs <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in observing the life found in pond water and of other samples. Microscopes may also prove useful for the water quality assessment for people that keep a home aquarium. Photographic documentation and drawing of the microscopic images are additional tasks that augment the spectrum of tasks of the amateur. There are even competitions for photomicrograph art. Participants of this pastime may either use commercially prepared microscopic slides or engage in the task of specimen preparation.|$|E

Critics described him as [...] "beautiful" [...] and [...] "Byronic", and noted that he [...] "appeared every inch the cocky TV producer he aspired to be". Some felt that the con represented an indictment on how reality television had altered the public's notion of celebrity. Paterson called the genre a [...] "Pied Piper call of fleeting TV fame" [...] that had become [...] "as powerful as any religious cult", while Paul English of The Daily Record noted that the swindle reflected a [...] "fascination with reality TV – and how the draw of being on telly can turn us into gullible fools".

[...] Referencing the lyrics in [...] "Every Rose Has Its Thorn", Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly felt that Cyrus was [...] "just not (yet) that thorny a girl" [...] despite visible efforts of rebellion. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian thought that Cyrus lost sight of her target audience with the project, noting that [...] "if you're old enough to stay up after 9:00 PM without asking permission, it's not intended for you" [...] while also commenting that children that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in the record had likely [...] "transferred their affections" [...] to the then-teenage Justin Bieber.

For example, a maize farmer in Iowa <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more <b>interested</b> in the probability that his crop fails (an event at the distributional tail) than the expected future yield (a value {{in the center of the}} distribution). A stakeholder that <b>is</b> <b>interested</b> in simply stress-testing a system <b>may</b> therefore <b>be</b> more <b>interested</b> in selecting representative GCMs that bound the projected impacts than in establishing a probability of occurrence.|$|R

2500|$|The {{method of}} maximum {{likelihood}} corresponds to many well-known estimation methods in statistics. For example, one <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> {{in the heights}} of adult female penguins, but is unable to measure the height of every single penguin in a population due to cost or time constraints. [...] Assuming that the heights are normally distributed with some unknown mean and variance, the mean and variance can be estimated with MLE while only knowing the heights of some sample of the overall population. [...] MLE would accomplish this by taking the mean and variance as parameters and finding particular parametric values that make the observed results the most probable given the model.|$|E

[...] Significant Jewish populations also remain in Middle Eastern and North African countries outside of Israel, particularly Iran, Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia, and Yemen.

2500|$|Rather than {{inferring}} {{the ancestral}} DNA sequence, one <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in the larger-scale molecular {{structure and content}} of an ancestral genome. This problem is often approached in a combinatorial framework, by modelling genomes as permutations of genes or homologous regions. Various operations are allowed on these permutations, such as an inversion (a segment of the permutation is reversed in-place), deletion (a segment is removed), transposition (a segment is removed {{from one part of}} the permutation and spliced in somewhere else), or gain of genetic content through recombination, duplication or horizontal gene transfer. The [...] "genome rearrangement problem", first posed by Watterson and colleagues, asks: given two genomes (permutations) and a set of allowable operations, what is the shortest sequence of operations that will transform one genome into the other? [...] A generalization of this problem applicable to ancestral reconstruction is the [...] "multiple genome rearrangement problem": given a set of genomes and a set of allowable operations, find (i) a binary tree with the given genomes as its leaves, and (ii) an assignment of genomes to the internal nodes of the tree, such that the total number of operations across the whole tree is minimized. [...] This approach is similar to parsimony, except that the tree is inferred along with the ancestral sequences. [...] Unfortunately, even the single genome rearrangement problem is NP-hard, although it has received much attention in mathematics and computer science (for a review, see Fertin and colleagues).|$|E
