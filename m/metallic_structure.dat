25|$|Lightning strikes to a <b>metallic</b> <b>structure</b> {{can vary}} from leaving no evidence, except perhaps, a small pit in the metal, to the {{complete}} destruction of the structure. When there is no evidence, analyzing the strikes is difficult. This means that a strike on an uninstrumented structure must be visually confirmed, and the random behavior of lightning renders such observations difficult. There are also inventors working on this problem, such as through a lightning rocket. While controlled experiments may be off in the future, very good data is being obtained through techniques which use radio receivers that watch for the characteristic electrical 'signature' of lightning strikes using fixed directional antennas. Through accurate timing and triangulation techniques, lightning strikes can be located with great precision, so strikes on specific objects often can be confirmed with confidence.|$|E
25|$|Adams, Chichoni and Molina gave {{detailed}} briefings for the animators {{for each}} environment and {{character in the}} game. Modeling and animation for the 30 environments and 10 characters was done on Softimage 3D, version 3.5. Most environments were done separately. However, {{the center of the}} ship in particular also included other environments as it connects the first and second class canals, the top of the well and the central well; Darren Blencowe was responsible for modeling the ship's center. A total of six 3D artists worked on the game. Rendering was done on Mental Ray; in order to complete the rendering in time, the team's systems administrator wrote a Perl-based software to control all rendering jobs for up to 20 processors working 24 hours a day. In order to animate the parrot, Philip Dubree, one of the team's animators, visited pet shops and studied macaws for inspiration. Dubree created a skeleton and modeled the wings and feathers, later adjoining the body. He also scanned photos of macaw features and used Photoshop to incorporate those in the parrot's textures. In order to create Titania's statue at the Top of the Well, animator John Attard build the 3D model as a refractive <b>metallic</b> <b>structure</b> and texturized it with streaks of oxidation on her face; Attard used the Statue of Liberty as a visual reference.|$|E
25|$|A {{section of}} this housing, on Santa Isabel Alley, was torn down and {{replaced}} by the National Theater in the latter 19th century. During the late 19th century and very early 20th, this theatre {{was the site of}} most of Mexico City's high culture, presenting events such as theatre, operettas, Viennese dance and more. It was then decided to replace this building with a more opulent one for the upcoming Centennial of Mexican Independence celebrations in 1910. The old theatre was demolished in 1901, and the new theatre would be called the Gran Teatro de Ópera. The work was awarded to Italian architect Adamo Boari, who favored neoclassical and art nouveau styles and who is responsible for the Palacio del Correo which is across the street. Adamo Boari promised in October 1904 to build a grand <b>metallic</b> <b>structure,</b> which at that time only existed in the United States, but not to this size. The first stone of the building was placed by Porfirio Díaz in 1904. Despite the 1910 deadline, by 1913, the building was hardly begun with only a basic shell. One {{reason for this is that}} the project became more complicated than anticipated as the heavy building sank into the soft spongy subsoil. The other reason was the political and economic instability that would lead to the Mexican Revolution. Full hostilities suspended construction of the palace completely and Adamo Boari returned to Italy.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{coupling}} strategy {{based on the}} control surface concept is used to self-consistently couple linear MHD solvers to 3 D codes for the eddy current computation of eddy currents in the <b>metallic</b> <b>structures</b> surrounding the plasma. The coupling is performed by assuming that the plasma inertia (and, with it, all Alfven wave-like phenomena) can be neglected on the time scale of interest, which is dictated by the relevant electromagnetic time of the <b>metallic</b> <b>structures.</b> As is shown, plasm{{a coupling}} with the <b>metallic</b> <b>structures</b> results in perturbations to the inductance matrix operator. In particular, by adopting the Fourier decomposition in poloidal and toroidal modes, {{it turns out that}} each toroidal mode can be associated with a matrix (additively) perturbing the inductance matrix that commonly describes the magnetic coupling of currents in vacuum. In this way, the treatment of resistive wall modes instabilities of various toroidal mode numbers and their possible cross-talk through the currents induced in the <b>metallic</b> <b>structures</b> can be easily studied...|$|R

We dealt with these two effects separately. When considering only the effects of the structural changes, we applied bulk permittivity to <b>metallic</b> <b>structures</b> with roughness. On the other hand, when considering only the effects of the increased loss, we applied the modified permittivity to <b>metallic</b> <b>structures</b> without roughness.
