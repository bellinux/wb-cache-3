40|$|Abstract Electronic {{properties}} of low-dimensional systems — and particularly quasi-one-dimensional systems — together with related correlated electron phenomena have {{for quite some}} time been at the very frontier of condensed matter physics. The interest ranges from purely fundamental reasons, since the reduced dimension offers a unique possibility of direct calculation of many-body problems, to nowadays very intense interest in functional nano-systems. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is arguably the most direct probe of the physical {{properties of}} solids, which arise from low-energy electronic excitations. With the present state-of-the-art high energy/angle resolution detectors, it allows a direct insight into the most subtle effects of electron correlations. All the results presented in this Thesis are the first ARPES measurements on several inorganic chain-like materials that are, or are related to Peierls conductors. These quasi-one-dimensional correlated materials typically exhibit non-Fermi liquid like properties that are at the same time incompatible with any of the existing singular Fermi liquid scenarios (such as Luttinger liquid). In that respect the aim is twofold: to reveal the new physics arising from direct electronic structure measurements, and secondly, to compare the emerging models for the spectroscopic features with the new findings. More specifically, the Thesis focuses on the influence of the electron-phonon coupling on the observed excitations. A quasi-one-dimensional insulating compound K 0. 33 MoO 3, known as <b>molybdenum</b> <b>red</b> bronze, is closely related to the blue bronze K 0. 3 MoO 3, a 1 D Peierls conductor. We disclose the details of the electron structure and reveal the important role of defect induced states. The small mobile polaron scenario describes well the blue bronze, and this picture is further strengthened, as we discuss here, by the spectroscopic similarities with the red bronze. Then we present measurements on two transition metal trichalcogenides: ZrTe 3 and TaSe 3. The first is a Peierls compound whose peculiar Fermi surface hides its low-dimensional character. The latter, strikingly, even though it does not exhibit any instability, shows spectroscopic similarities with the Peierls conductors, thereby demonstrating the importance of electron-phonon interactions in this material, as well as the general importance of the particularities of the Fermi surface in setting the conditions for an electronic instability. Finally, we report the results {{on one of the most}} intriguing materials in the field — BaVS 3. This correlated electron system demonstrates a wealth of complex, poorly understood phases. Extensive experimental findings cannot easily be put together into a coherent picture. Our direct electronic structure measurements suggest that the puzzling electronic properties are due to the interplay of the 1 D states and a narrow localized band. We find supporting evidence for a one-dimensional instability driving the metal-insulator transition at 69 K and propose its realization through a mechanism of interband nesting. We conclude that there is a direct link between the observed non-Fermi liquid features and the intrinsic characteristics of 1 D Peierls conductors and/or one-dimensionality in general. The influence of electron-phonon coupling in conjunction with the reduced dimensionality leads to spectroscopic features that hide the realizations of the singular behavior. However, a detailed modeling of the new data presented here is necessary to place them in the framework of the emerging theories...|$|E
40|$|A new {{spectrophotometric}} method for {{the determination of}} molybdenum {{is based on the}} extraction of the orange <b>red</b> <b>molybdenum</b> thiocyanate- 2 -acetylpyridinethiosemicarbazone complex into chloroform from hydrochloric acid. The complex has an absorption maximum at 470 nm with a molar absorptivity of 1. 7 Ã— 104 liters molâˆ’ 1 cmâˆ’ 1. Beer's law is valid from 0. 1 to 6. 5 ppm of molybdenum.

40|$|Defects {{induced by}} {{electron}} irradiation in the <b>red</b> <b>molybdenum</b> bronze of potassium K 0. 33 MoO 3 {{have been studied}} by E. P. R. spectroscopy. Two main types of centers (A and B) have been observed. They both {{have been identified as}} unpaired 4 d electrons localized on one molybdenum atom with a weak interaction with two other ones. A very simple electronic model is proposed to explain qualitatively the main features of these two paramagnetic centers. Measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation time of defect A show a temperature variation much slower than expected from the standard theory. This unusual dependence (laws in T 3 or T 5) can be explained by an extended theory which takes into account the contributions of lattice vibrations at the defect sites...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} models for molybdopterin-dependent enzymes. Several model systems {{containing}} molybdenum or tungsten {{have been prepared}} and characterised, and their reactivity with oxygen atom acceptors and donors have been investigated. Oxygen atom transfer reactions involving oxomolybdenum bis-dithiolene complexes have been modelled using density functional calculations. The first molybdenum(VI) complexes containing unperturbed cis -MoOS moieties, [MoOS(OSiPh 3) 2 (L) ] where L is bidentate nitrogen ligand, have been prepared as models for the xanthine oxidase family of mononuclear molybdenum enzymes. Spectroscopic measurements (1 H-NMR, IR, XAS, and X-ray crystallography) confirm {{the integrity of the}} cis -MoOS moiety both in solution and in the solid state. When [MoOS(OSiPh 3) 2 (Me 4 phen) ] is reacted with PPh 3, a good oxo acceptor, the complex does not undergo oxygen atom transfer but instead sulfur atom transfer to form Ph 3 PS and [Mo V OCl(OSiPh 3) 2 (Me 4 phen) ]. Two dioxotungsten(VI) complexes, [WO 2 (t BuL-NS) 2] (t BuL-NS - = bis(4 -tert-butylphenyl) - 2 -pyridylmethanethiolate(1 -)) and [WO 2 (t BuL-NO) 2] (t BuL-NO - = bis(4 -tert-butylphenyl) - 2 -pyridylmethanolate(1 -)) have been prepared as models for mononuclear tungsten enzymes. They have been spectroscopically and structurally characterised. The dioxomolybdenum(VI) analogue of [WO 2 (t BuL-NS) 2] can be reduced to a mono-oxomolybdenum(IV) complex by phosphines and the molybdenum(IV) complex can reduce a range of oxygen atom donors. In contrast [WO 2 (t BuL-NS) 2] does not undergo the corresponding oxygen atom transfer chemistry with phoshines, which may be attributed to a larger thermodymic barrier for reduction of tungsten(VI) compared to molybdenum(VI). A dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex, [MoO 2 (L-O) ]PF 6 (L-OH = N-(2 -hydroxybenzyl) -N,N-bis(2 -pyridylmethyl) amine) has been synthesised as a functional model for molybdenum oxotransferases. When the complex is reacted with phosphines in methanol, phosphine oxides are formed together with a <b>red,</b> air-sensitive, <b>molybdenum</b> complex. The identity of the red complex is not established but it is proposed to be a Mo(V) complex. The <b>red</b> <b>molybdenum</b> complex can be oxidised to [MoO 2 (L-O) ] + by addition of oxygen atom donors such as DMSO or nitrate, thereby mimicking the activity of molybdenum oxotransferases. Attempts at isolating the red complex leads to the formation of a dark purple m-oxo-bridged Mo(V) dimer, [(L-O) OMo(m-O) MoO(L-O) ] 2 +. Computer modelling of the reaction of [MoO 2 (mnt) 2] 2 - (mnt 2 - = 1, 2 -dicyano-ethylene- 1, 2 -dithiolate(2 -)) with hydrogen sulfite shows that the reaction mechanism is likely to involve a direct attack of the sulfur lone pair on one of the oxo ligands. The reaction proceeds via an oxygen atom transfer reaction where the substrate is oxidised to hydrogen sulfate, this is in good agreement with proposed mechanisms from other model systems and with the proposed mechanism for sulfite oxidase itself. Density functional modelling of the reduction of Me 3 NO by [MoO(mnt) 2] 2 - shows that the reaction proceeds via an intermediate containing coordinated Me 3 NO to formation of the products, [MoO 2 (mnt) 2] 2 - and NMe 3. In the final transition state, one of the Mo-S bonds of one mnt ligand is elongated due to the trans influence of the spectator oxo ligand. Modelling of the reduction of DMSO by [Mo(OCH 3) (mnt) 2] - shows that the methoxy group may be beneficial for the reaction in two ways: i) by lowering the energy of the products ([MoO(OCH 3) (mnt) 2] - and DMS) relative to the reactants, and ii) by offering an alternative reaction pathway with a twisted trigonal prismatic geometry in the transition state. This finding may have implications for the enzymes in the DMSO reductase family of mononuclear molybdenum enzymes where an amino acid residue (serine, cysteine or seleneocysteine) is found in the active site...|$|R
