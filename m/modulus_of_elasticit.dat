For this purpose an empirical research project with 50 beams in structural sizes subjected to bending was carried out. The results obtained according to European standards show the values of both types of Modulus of Elasticity and the influence of the more important strength and stiffness reducing growth characteristics on their variation, as well as give evidence of the effectiveness of the criterion established in the American standard ASTM D 198 (1999) for correcting the influence of shear on the global <b>Modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>Elasticit...</b>|$|E
40|$|Analyses of the {{vascular}} system have characteristically {{been based on}} assumptions that the vessel wall is isotropic and that its properties and behavior can be linearized. To test the validity of these assumptions, excised arteries of dogs were submitted to stepwise strains tangentially and longitudinally during conditions of control, vasoconstriction, and inhibition of muscle metabo-lism. These strains were recorded simultaneously with the associated stresses, and the relations between stress and strain were studied during both dynamic-and steady-strain states. The vessels were anisotropic within most of the physio-logical ranges of tangential and longitudinal stress and strain. During control conditions the tangential modulus of elasticity was higher than the longitudinal; during vasoconstriction the situation was reversed for wall tensions correspond-ing to a blood pressure equal to or smaller than 190 mm Hg; however, above this value isotropic behavior prevailed. Vasoconstriction increased the non-linearity of the stress-strain relation, and decreased the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticit...</b>|$|E

The relative dynamic modulus of elasticity in frequency method among the rest is widely used to measure the degree of deterioration of concrete specimens、for a good correlation can be seen　between values of the dynamic modulus of elasticity change and the strength change of concrete. On the other hand, some faults of this method have already been pointed out. 　　　In this paper, various measuring methods are used to estimate the degree of deterioration of concrete. They are relative dynamic modulus of elasticity in ultrasonic method, in addition to frequency method, length change in dialgage and contact gage method, and weight change. From the test results, it can be concluded that length change in dialgage method expresses clearly the degree of deterioration and has a good parallel relation to dynamic <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticit...</b>|$|E

We present a covariant derivation of equations of motion, viewing motion as a curve in an infinite-dimensional Banach space of embeddings of a body manifold in a space manifold. Our main application is the motion of residually-stressed elastic bodies; residual stress results from a geometric incompatibility between body and space manifolds.

40|$|Abstract. The study {{compared}} basic density, {{compressive strength}} along the grain, {{static bending strength}} and modulus of elasticity of juvenile wood in pines from different Kraft’s classes. Analyses were conducted in 8 mature pine monocultures in north-western Poland. In each experimental site a total of 9 trees were selected, thus the analyses were conducted on 72 model trees (with 24 for each social class of tree position in the stand). The highest values of analysed technical parameters were recorded for wood of co-dominant trees, the lowest were found for predominant trees, while intermediate values were recorded for wood of dominant trees. All the reported differences were statistically significant. Similar dependencies were observed when comparing wood from different sections of stems, with the greatest disproportions, frequently statistically significant, found in their lower sections.

40|$|Abstract: Shearing {{stress of}} wheat stalk was {{measured}} for four moisture content levels (15, 25, 35 and 45 %, w. b.), three cutting heights (100, 200 and 300 mm), {{two types of}} cutting knives, smooth and serrated edge and three blades oblique angle (0, 15 and 30 deg.). The results of data analysis showed that the shearing stress of wheat stems decreased as the moisture content decreased. The shearing force of stems, decreased as the cutting height of stalk increased, because of a reduction in stalk diameter. Shearing stress was lower by using smooth edge knife, because of less friction than serrated one. The blade oblique angle of 30 degree showed the least shearing stress. The average of shearing stress varied between 3. 25 and 3. 86 MPa. Bending stress and modulus of elasticity increased as the moisture content decreased and decreased as the cutting height of stem increased. The average of bending stress varied between 17. 74 - 26. 77 MPa and modulus of elasticity varied between 3. 13 - 3. 75 Gpa.

Studies have been carried out to investigate the possibility of utilizing a broad range of materials as partial replacement materials for cement and aggregate in the production of concrete. The present experimental study was conceived following the general purpose of testing new sustainable building processes and modern production systems, aims not only at saving natural raw materials and reducing energy consumption, but also to recycle industrial by-products. The objectives {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of use of coal bottom ash as partial replacement of fine aggregates in various percentages (0 – 30 %), on concrete properties such as compressive strength, spiltting tensile strength test, flexural strength and modulus of elasticity and also the effect of microsilica in bottom ash concrete having maximum compressive strength. The test results of this research work indicates that at fixed water cement ratio, workability decreased with the use of coal bottom ash as a replacement of fine aggregate in concrete. Compressive strength of bottom ash concrete at the curing age of 28 days was increased compared to control concrete.

One way to overcome this is to recycle the waste concrete. However, the use of waste as recycled aggregate needs to be studied more, with experimentally testing and analysis of their characteristics. The methods and procedures for testing the implementation of recycled aggregate was done with reference to ASTM standards. By replacing the concrete base material in this case in the form of split coarse aggregate replaced with piece of waste of light concrete with specific composition, which is to analyze the average compressive strength of concrete using coarse aggregate from piece of waste of light concrete. Strength of concrete that will be targeted is 25 MPa. Then testing the modulus of elasticity at 28 days. From the test results obtained by the value of the concrete compressive strength is obtained by replacing the cracked split with light concrete the waste is 14. 909 MPa. The modulus of elasticity of concrete at 28 days for concrete using light concrete cracked the waste amounted to 18372. 53 MPa. Weight densityof concrete using cracked of waste of lightconcrete is 1918. 69 kg/m 3 that is included in the category of light concrete because its density is less than normal concrete (2200 - 2500 kg/m 3). Further testing needs to conducted on the effect of adding reinforcement and fibers to increase the strength of concrete.
