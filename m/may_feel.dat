5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{have shown}} that all divers are {{affected}} by nitrogen narcosis, though some experience lesser effects than others. Even though {{it is possible that}} some divers can manage better than others because of learning to cope with the subjective impairment, the underlying behavioral effects remain. These effects are particularly dangerous because a diver <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> they are not experiencing narcosis, yet still be affected by it.|$|E
50|$|The {{perpetrator}} <b>may</b> {{begin to}} <b>feel</b> remorse, guilty feelings, or fear that their partner will leave {{or call the}} police. The victim feels pain, fear, humiliation, disrespect, confusion, and <b>may</b> mistakenly <b>feel</b> responsible.|$|R

However, Mays begins to rise in the polls after his brother persuades him to speak out for what he believes. He begins to talk about issues such as welfare, money, society, etc.|$|R
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a criminal record may simply withhold that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E
5|$|Much {{research}} has been done into erection. By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them. Studies have found that half or up to 65% of men with SCI have orgasms, although the experience <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> different than it did before the injury. Most men say it feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.|$|E
50|$|Our body schemata may {{transcend the}} realities of what our bodies {{actually}} are—or in other words, {{we may have a}} different mental picture of our bodies than what they physically are. This is evidenced when individuals who lose limbs have phantom limb sensations. Individuals who lose a limb <b>may</b> still <b>feel</b> like they have that limb. They <b>may</b> even <b>feel</b> in that limb sensations from other limbs.|$|R

5|$|The most {{dangerous}} aspects of narcosis are the impairment of judgement, multi-tasking and coordination, {{and the loss}} of decision-making ability and focus. Other effects include vertigo and visual or auditory disturbances. The syndrome may cause exhilaration, giddiness, extreme anxiety, depression, or paranoia, depending on the individual diver and the diver's medical or personal history. When more serious, the diver <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> overconfident, disregarding normal safe diving practices. Slowed mental activity, as indicated by increased reaction time and increased errors in cognitive function, are effects which increase the risk of a diver mismanaging an incident. Narcosis reduces both the perception of cold discomfort and shivering and thereby affects the production of body heat and consequently allows a faster drop in the core temperature in cold water, with reduced awareness of the developing problem.|$|E

25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} may initially include: an increased heart rate, feeling faint upon standing, {{and an increased}} breath rate. As more blood is lost the women <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> cold, their blood pressure may drop, and they may become unconscious.|$|E

25|$|Nifedipine rapidly lowers blood pressure, and {{patients}} are commonly warned they <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> dizzy or faint {{after taking the}} first few doses. Tachycardia (fast heart rate) may occur as a reaction. These problems are much less frequent in the sustained-release preparations of nifedipine.|$|E

25|$|Patients often report {{feelings}} of deep relaxation {{during and after}} the treatment session, and <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> light-headed.

25|$|To {{begin with}} {{cognitive}} responses in infidelity, individuals {{whom have been}} cheated on experience jealousy cognitively for many reasons. They <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> that their partner has lost interest in them and feel that they cannot compare to the persons with whom they are being cheated on with (Johnson, 2017). Therefore, they anticipate {{the loss of their}} partner's emotional interest in them and become jealous for more clear reasons. They could believe that they are losing someone who they care deeply about, or they <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> as if their partner is mad at them and doing it out of spite, etc. The anticipation of jealous feelings towards an individual’s significant other causes a cognitive response, even without the burden of proof.|$|E

25|$|Losing a loved one, {{especially}} {{at an early}} age can have lasting effects on an individual. The individual <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> fear, guilt, anger or loneliness. This can drive a person into solitude and depression. They may turn to alcohol and drugs to cope with their feelings.|$|E
25|$|Regression {{towards the}} mean – since many {{diseases}} or conditions are cyclical, symptoms vary {{over time and}} patients tend to seek care when discomfort is greatest; they <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> better anyway {{but because of the}} timing of the visit to the homeopath they attribute improvement to the preparation taken.|$|E
25|$|Antidepressants {{can cause}} {{emotional}} blunting, or numbness. This is {{a reduction in}} extremes of emotion, both positive and negative.
