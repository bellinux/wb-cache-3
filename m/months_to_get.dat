25|$|Porter {{has pointed}} out that Massey and Kuhn's analogies include a number of errors, e.g. Massey stated that December 25 as the date of birth of Jesus was {{selected}} based on the birth of Horus, but the New Testament does not include any reference to the date or season of the birth of Jesus. The earliest known source recognizing the 25th of December as the date of birth of Jesus is by Hippolytus of Rome, written around the beginning of the 3rd century, {{based on the assumption that}} the conception of Jesus took place at the Spring equinox. Hippolytus placed the equinox on March 25 and then added 9 <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> December 25, thus establishing the date for festivals. The Roman Chronography of 354 then included an early reference to the celebration of a Nativity feast in December, as of the fourth century.|$|E

25|$|Fox species {{differ in}} fur color, length, and density. Coat colors range from pearly white to {{black and white}} to black flecked with white or grey on the underside. Fennec foxes (and other species of fox adapted {{to life in the}} desert, such as kit foxes), for example, have large ears and short fur to aid in keeping the body cool. Arctic foxes, on the other hand, have tiny ears and short limbs as well as thick, {{insulating}} fur, which aid in keeping the body warm. Red foxes, by contrast, have a typical auburn pelt, the tail normally ending with white marking. A fox's coat color and texture may vary due to the change in seasons; fox pelts are richer and denser in the colder months and lighter in the warmer <b>months.</b> <b>To</b> <b>get</b> rid of the dense winter coat, foxes moult once a year around April; the process begins from the feet, up the legs, and then along the back.

25|$|In 1982, Kiss {{asked for}} Wendy and the Plasmatics {{to appear as}} a special guest on their tour. Kiss wanted the {{controversial}} street edge that Wendy would bring {{as part of their}} tour and for the Plasmatics it was a chance to play in front of different audiences in different markets than they would ordinarily play. By the end of the tour with KISS it was clear that, although the formal notice that Capitol would not pick up their option for a second album did not come in for six months, the relationship with Capitol was done. It had taken months and months for the deal to be done, months to record and release the album and now <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the deal. Gene Simmons approached Wendy and Rod about producing the next Wendy O. Williams album. So as to avoid any wasted time in legal issues with Capitol Records, it was decided not to use the Plasmatics name on the record at all and was simply called WOW, the initials for Wendy O. Williams. Gene Simmons felt it would give him the freedom he wanted to add more new players to the album.|$|E
25|$|Several episodes {{received}} {{extremely high}} audience figures, especially the first series. This was {{partly due to}} the fact that the main rival channel to BBC One channel in the UK, ITV, was in the middle of a long protracted strike which started in early August 1979, which saw nearly all of the local ITV companies go off air and no programmes being aired from the network (except Channel Television in the Channel Island), leaving only BBC One and BBC Two as the channels left for the British public to watch until Wednesday 24th October 1979 when ITV returned to air, with the strike ending in a pay agreement. However many viewers remained with the BBC and shows such as To The Manor Born, as ITV took some <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> going again with new programmes. For the first month after the strike had ended, ITV found it hard to win back viewers who preferred to remain with the BBC, as ITV was airing repeats and filler programmes until new content was made from November 1979. This gave To The Manor Born a huge advantage with the viewing public. In 1979, the last episode of the first series received 23.95 million viewers, the fourth-highest figures for any programme in the UK in the 1970s, and the highest for a non-live event. The following year, 21.55 million people watched the last episode of series two, the fifth-highest viewing figure for the 1980s. The final episode in 1981, when Audrey and Richard marry, received 17.80 million viewers. The 2007 Christmas special garnered 10.25 million viewers and ranked as the 6th most watched programme in the UK for that week.|$|E

[...] Later, Mulder comes to {{question}} Weems again and another one of Cutrona's enforcers comes to kill Weems but his bullet ricochets off Weems' pocket knife, barely grazes Mulder's arm, and hits and kills the enforcer. Weems confesses that he's been {{trying to find a way}} to get $100,000 to pay for an expensive medical treatment for the serious illness of a boy in his apartment building named Richie (Shia LaBeouf). Weems attempts at getting the money, however, have brought him above the radar. Later, after Weems is hit by a car, it appears that Henry's lucky streak has reached its end. Cutrona kidnaps Richie's mom, Maggie, to stop Henry from testifying against him. Weems turns himself in to Cutrona so he would let Maggie go; instead, they plan to kill him. As they are about to execute Weems in the basement (where Maggie is also being held), Cutrona and his mobster partner, Dominic, are killed in a bizarre turn of events, whereas Weems and Maggie are unharmed as Mulder arrives with backup. In the end, it turns out by surprise that Cutrona is an organ donor and a perfect match for Richie, who gets the treatment and lives. Weems then activates a toy Goldberg machine that he made for Richie earlier.|$|E
500|$|The Dhoom series {{began with}} the release of Dhoom in 2004. The film became a {{commercial}} box office hit and received generally positive reviews from audiences, but not so much from critics. As a result, producer Yash Chopra announced plans for a sequel, titled Dhoom 2: Back in Action. John Abraham, portrayer of Kabir Sharma, the villain of the predecessor, was eliminated from the sequel because Chopra did not want Dhoom 2 to repeat the stories featured in its predecessor. Instead, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai were introduced into the franchise as the sequel's main villains. Aishwarya Rai's character was summarised as Catwoman, a female fictional comic book femme fatale or anti-hero [...] Rai stated, [...] "All I can tell you is it would be nothing like anything you've seen me do before." [...] Producer Aditya Chopra told Rai to lose weight after she gained it for her role in 2004's Bride & Prejudice. Yash Chopra stated, [...] "But yes, the role does require Aishwarya to convey oodles of sensuality. She has asked for a couple of <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into shape. We (at Yash Raj Films) are very clear about every character in every script and what's required of the actors. Before Dhoom, Esha Deol was specifically briefed about the look and the attitude she needed to cultivate. She readily agreed, and look at what Dhoom did to her career!" [...] Roshan also lost twelve pounds of weight at Aditya Chopra's request. With the exception of Abraham and Esha Deol, all of the other main actors in Dhoom were hired again for Dhoom 2.|$|E

500|$|Kubrick's final {{film was}} Eyes Wide Shut (1999), {{starring}} Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a Manhattan couple on a sexual odyssey. Tom Cruise portrays {{a doctor who}} witnesses a bizarre masked quasireligious orgiastic ritual at a country mansion, a discovery which later threatens his life. [...] The story is based on Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 Freudian novella Traumnovelle (Dream Story in English), which Kubrick relocated from turn-of-the-century Vienna to New York City in the 1990s. Kubrick said of the novel: [...] "A difficult book to describe—what good book isn't. It explores the sexual ambivalence of a happy marriage and tries to equate the importance of sexual dreams and might-have-beens with reality. All of Schnitzler's work is psychologically brilliant". [...] Although Kubrick was almost 70, he worked relentlessly for 15 <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the film out by its planned release date of July 16, 1999. [...] He commenced a script with Frederic Raphael, and worked 18 hours a day, all the while maintaining complete confidentiality about the film. Principal photography began on November 7, 1996, and ended in February 1998. Eyes Wide Shut, like Lolita and A Clockwork Orange before it, faced censorship before release. Kubrick sent an unfinished preview copy to the stars and producers {{a few months before}} release, but his sudden death on March 7, 1999, came a few days after he finished editing. He never saw the final version released to the public, but he did see the preview of the film with Warner Bros., Cruise, and Kidman, and had reportedly told Warner executive Julian Senior that it was [...] "my best film ever". Today, critical opinion of the film is mixed, and it is viewed less favorably than most of Kubrick's films. Roger Ebert awarded it 3.5 out 4 stars, comparing the structure to a thriller and writing that it is [...] "like an erotic daydream about chances missed and opportunities avoided", and thought that Kubrick's use of lighting at Christmas made the film [...] "all a little garish, like an urban sideshow." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post disliked the film, writing that it [...] "is actually sad, rather than bad. It feels creaky, ancient, hopelessly out of touch, infatuated with the hot taboos of his youth and unable to connect with that twisty thing contemporary sexuality has become." ...|$|E

His replacement was cited as a bid to bolster military strength. According to MONUC commanders the town had been captured on Sunday, though they could not confirm whether withdrawal had begun. Meanwhile, the French Foreign Ministry circulated a draft asking the UN to reinforce the MONUC garrison in the Congo by 3,000. This move was stated as a possible measure of stability, but not one of peace. UN spokesman Alan Doss said that [...] "Reinforcements are not going to resolve all the problems...

2500|$|A {{major problem}} {{throughout}} PDPA's rule {{was that the}} majority of mid-level cadres resided in Kabul, rather then the places they were responsible for. Of the 10,000 mid-level cadres in the mid-1980s, 5,000 of them resided in Kabul. For instance, in the period 1982–83 the governor of Faryab province only visited the province during the winter months, since the mujahideen withdrew their troops from the area during those months. Another problem, in Faryab province the PDPA was inactive and the majority of the locals believed that Mohammad Daoud Khan, the [...] president which the communists overthrew in 1978, was still ruling the country. Another case, that of Nangrahar province (in which the government was in complete control) faced a similar problem; the party organization laying dormant. To solve this problem, the PDPA sought to improve the cadres education by enrolling them to educational institutions within the PDPA, public universities or giving them educational opportunities in the Eastern Bloc or the Soviet Union. The Social Science Institute of the PDPA had a capacity of 2,500 students, {{and by the end of}} the 1980s it had given degrees to over 10,000 individuals. Despite all this, the main problem facing the party was the unsafe conditions facing party members serving in the countryside; for instance, when the Ghazni Provincial Committee convened for a meeting the participants had to wait for three <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> home (waiting for an armoured column and a helicopter).|$|E
2500|$|The initial form of {{government}} was an executive council formed of public servant appointed by and responsible to the governor. This changed when the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that granted self-government to the Colony of New Zealand, was received. This allowed for a bicameral General Assembly (or Parliament), consisting of the Governor, an appointed Legislative Council and an elected House of Representatives, with an Executive Council nominally appointed by the Governor. It also allowed for provincial governments, and six provinces were initially established. The first general election was held in 1853 and Parliament convened in Auckland for its first session, which was opened on 27 May 1854. On 3 June, {{the question of the}} seat of Parliament was first discussed, with Edward Gibbon Wakefield arguing that the seat {{of government}} must be shifted to Wellington. Travel to and from parliament was arduous, and the members from the far south had taken two <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to Auckland. A more central location was desirable, a move not supported by the members from Auckland constituencies. What also did not help was that the General Assembly House had been erected in a hurry and {{was nothing more than a}} shell, and members called it the [...] "Shedifice". The wind blew through the building, it leaked in the rain, and basic amenities like toilets were missing. Built on what was then the edge of town, it was a building without comforts.|$|E
