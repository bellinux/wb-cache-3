5000|$|In {{addition}} to very low gain of about 5 {{and a short}} lifetime of about 30 - 100 hours, the primitive Audion had erratic characteristics because it was incompletely evacuated. De Forest believed that ionization of residual air was key to Audion operation. [...] This made it a more sensitive detector but also caused its electrical characteristics to vary during use. As the tube heated up, gas released from the metal elements would change the pressure in the tube, changing the plate current and other characteristics, so it required periodic bias adjustments to keep it at the correct operating point. Each Audion stage usually had a rheostat to adjust the filament current, and often a potentiometer or <b>multiposition</b> switch to control the plate voltage. The filament rheostat was also used as a volume control. The many controls made multitube Audion receivers complicated to operate.|$|E

5000|$|This circuit had two advantages. [...] One {{was that}} {{by using the}} correct turns ratio, the {{impedance}} of the antenna could be matched to the impedance of the receiver, to transfer maximum RF power to the receiver. Impedance matching was important to achieve maximum receiving range in the unamplified receivers of this era. [...] The coils usually had taps which could be selected by a <b>multiposition</b> switch. The second advantage was that due to [...] "loose coupling" [...] it had a much narrower bandwidth than a simple tuned circuit, and the bandwidth could be adjusted. [...] Unlike in an ordinary transformer, the two coils were [...] "loosely coupled"; separated physically so not all the magnetic field from the primary passed through the secondary, reducing the mutual inductance. This gave the coupled tuned circuits much [...] "sharper" [...] tuning, a narrower bandwidth than a single tuned circuit. In the [...] "Navy type" [...] loose coupler (see picture), widely used with crystal receivers, the smaller secondary coil was mounted on a rack which could be slid {{in or out of}} the primary coil, to vary the mutual inductance between the coils. [...] When the operator encountered an interfering signal at a nearby frequency, the secondary could be slid further out of the primary, reducing the coupling, which narrowed the bandwidth, rejecting the interfering signal. A disadvantage was that all three adjustments in the loose coupler - primary tuning, secondary tuning, and coupling - were interactive; changing one changed the others. So tuning in a new station was a process of successive adjustments.|$|E
