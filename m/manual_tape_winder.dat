40|$|Automated water-level data {{collected}} using vented pressure transducers deployed in Hanford Site Central Plateau wells commonly display more variability than <b>manual</b> <b>tape</b> measurements {{in response to}} barometric pressure fluctuations. To explain this difference, {{it was hypothesized that}} vented pressure transducers installed in some wells are subject to barometric pressure effects that reduce water-level measurement accuracy. Vented pressure transducers use a vent tube, which is open to the atmosphere at land surface, to supply air pressure to the transducer housing for barometric compensation so the transducer measurements will represent only the water pressure. When using vented transducers, the assumption is made that the air pressure between land surface and the well bore is in equilibrium. By comparison, absolute pressure transducers directly measure the air pressure within the wellbore. Barometric compensation is achieved by subtracting the well bore air pressure measurement from the total pressure measured by a second transducer submerged in the water. Thus, no assumption of air pressure equilibrium is needed. In this study, water-level measurements were collected from the same Central Plateau wells using both vented and absolute pressure transducers to evaluate the different methods of barometric compensation. <b>Manual</b> <b>tape</b> measurements were also collected to evaluate the transducers. Measurements collected during this study demonstrated that the vented pressure transducers over-responded to barometric pressure fluctuations due to a pressure disequilibrium between the air within the wellbores and the atmosphere at land surface. The disequilibrium is thought to be caused by the relatively long time required for barometric pressure changes to equilibrate between land surface and the deep vadose zone and may be exacerbated by the restriction of air flow between the well bore and the atmosphere due to the presence of sample pump landing plates and well caps. The disequilibrium is likely limited to wells screened across the water table (i. e., open to the deep vadose zone) where the depth to water is large or a low-permeability layer occurs in the vadose zone. Such wells are a pathway for air movement between the deep vadose zone and land surface and this sustains the pressure disequilibrium between the well bore and the atmosphere for longer time periods. Barometric over-response was not observed with the absolute pressure transducers because barometric compensation was achieved by directly measuring the air pressure within the well. Users of vented pressure transducers {{should be aware of the}} over-response issue in certain Hanford Site wells and ascertain if it will affect the use of the data. Pressure disequilibrium between the well and the atmosphere can be identified by substantial air movement through the wellbore. In wells exhibiting pressure disequilibrium, it is recommended that absolute pressure transducers be used rather than vented transducers for applications that require precise automated determinations of well water-level changes in response to barometric pressure fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} data archival and {{retrieval system}} has been designed, developed, and implemented to improve the management of aeropropulsion test data at the Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC). Previously, the data archival and retrieval involved a laborious process that included <b>manual</b> <b>tape</b> operations and record keeping. The Test Data Management System (TDMS) utilizes high-volume mass storage systems coupled with specialized and highly automated communications and user interface software for archiving and retrieving. Acquired, performance, and mathematical model data for the Engine Test Facility (ETF) at AEDC are now automatically archived. In addition, custom software, instrumentation information, and various support files used in the data production process are archived with the data. The archived data may be retrieved automatically from the mass storage system for further processing or analysis as desired. The Test Data Management System can be accessed directly via a graphical user interface that provides visibility to information stored on the archival system and the capability for the user to retrieve these data. An application programming interface (API) library has also been developed for programmatic access by various applications. The system was designed to provide maximum flexibility and expandability for various data types and data formats. Enhancements have been proposed to support the definition, storage, and user queries on an expanded set of metadata.

40|$|Abdominal fat, and in particular, visceral {{adipose tissue}} (VAT), is the {{critical}} fat depot associated with metabolic aberrations. At present, VAT can only be accurately measured by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This {{study was designed to}} compare a new abdominal bioelectrical impedance (BIA) device against total abdominal adipose tissue (TAAT) and VAT area measurements made from an abdominal MRI scan, and to assess its reliability and accuracy. One-hundred twenty participants were recruited, stratified by gender and BMI. Participants had triplicate measures of abdominal fat and waist circumference (WC) with the AB- 140 (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan) and WC measurements using a <b>manual</b> <b>tape</b> measure. A single abdominal MRI scan was performed as the reference method. Triplicate measures with the AB- 140 showed excellent precision for "visceral fat level," trunk fat %, and WC. AB- 140 "visceral fat level" showed significantly stronger correlations with MRI TAAT area than with MRI VAT area (r = 0. 94 vs. 0. 65 in men and 0. 92 vs. 0. 64 in women). AB- 140 WC showed good correlation with manual WC measurements (r = 0. 95 in men and 0. 90 in women). AB- 140 and manual WCs showed comparable correlations with MRI TAAT area (r = 0. 92 and 0. 96 in men and 0. 88 and 0. 88 in women). AB- 140 is a simple, quick, and precise technique to measure abdominal fat and WC in healthy adults. It provides a useful proxy for TAAT measured by MRI, comparable to the correlation obtained with manual WC measurements.

The questionnaire was sent to all school foodservice representatives in Iowa (N = 363). Interview transcripts were analyzed manually and with Atlas. ti™, a qualitative software package. Questionnaire responses were analyzed using SPSS; descriptive statistics, including frequencies, means, and standard deviations, were computed. Results Of the 363 questionnaires mailed to school foodservice representatives, 77 completed questionnaires were received for a response rate of 22 %. Respondents reported the most common training methods (on-the-job and demonstrations), tools (texts/ <b>manuals</b> and audio/video <b>tapes),</b> and topics (food safety and cleaning procedures) used for all employees in their operations. Respondents agreed that different training methods needed to be used with employees with disabilities.

QLQ-C 30, POMS-SF and DWI-CI were first recommended and used as indicators for measuring the results of QoL, emotion and coping method in cancer patients in Chinese mainland. NK cell activity and IgG、IgM, IgA were used to measure the immune function. 120 cancer chemotherapy patients were randomly assigned to one of four conditions formed by a 2 (pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy) * 2 (experimental and control group) factorial design. The effect of psychological intervention on quality of life and immune function for cancer patients was investigated as well as the mediate role of coping method and personality and their factors. The efficiency of the tools was verified. The major conclusive results drawn out from the study were: 1. After treated by psychological intervention for three months, the status of quality of life and the symptoms of the patients during the chemotherapy was improved accompanying with the increase of immune parameters, especially the NK cell activity. The influential way of the factors, which effected on the effect of psychological intervention on the quality of life, immune parameters and coping methods, was synthetic. There was obvious mutual effects among the factors. 2. The patients of experimental group used more the active behavior, more the active cognition and less the avoidance coping method than those in control group. 3. The results of measurement showed that the personality of the caner patients was of obvious concealing and hiding. 4.
