5|$|Fisheries {{and tourism}} are {{significant}} {{sources of income}} all along the Adriatic coast. Adriatic Croatia's tourism industry has grown faster economically {{than the rest of}} the Adriatic Basin's. <b>Maritime</b> <b>transport</b> is also a significant branch of the area's economy—there are 19 seaports in the Adriatic that each handle more than a million tonnes of cargo per year. The largest Adriatic seaport by annual cargo turnover is the Port of Trieste, while the Port of Split is the largest Adriatic seaport by passengers served per year.|$|E
5|$|Callaghan {{is perhaps}} best known for ordering, despite {{disagreement}} from some of his crew, that an honorable funeral be held for an enemy pilot who died during a suicide attack on the Missouri in 1945. Following World War II, he directed the US Navy's transportation service and filled senior command roles in eastern Asia, including leadership of the US Pacific Fleet's Amphibious Force during the Korean War. He retired from the US Navy at the rank of vice admiral in 1957 and worked in civilian <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> before retiring to Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the growing importance of German <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> routes through Norwegian waters, the Royal Air Force's Coastal Command transferred seven squadrons of anti-shipping aircraft from bases in eastern England to northern Scotland during September and October 1944. Three squadrons equipped with Mosquito light bombers were stationed at RAF Banff while a wing made up of four squadrons operating Beaufighter heavy fighters was based at RAF Dallachy. The Dallachy Wing comprised the British No.144 Squadron, Canadian No.404 Squadron, Australian No. 455 Squadron and New Zealand No. 489 Squadron. These four squadrons were veterans of many anti-shipping operations over the North Sea.|$|E

5|$|Eight {{additional}} Pendolinos {{were ordered}} {{at the end}} 1997 {{at the price of}} FIM 77 million per train (€13 million). They were delivered between 2000 and 2002. The main series trains differed in various ways from the prototypes. The new trains allowed Pendolino traffic to extend: they started running between Helsinki and Jyväskylä on 22 October 2001. In June 2002, the network was expanded further, and routes were continued from Tampere onwards to Oulu and from Jyväskylä to Kuopio. One of the main series trains (number 7x08) was damaged during <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> in October 2001. The badly secured train had come loose during a storm on the Atlantic, almost causing the loss of M/S Traden, the ship carrying it. Thanks to good actions of the ship's crew, it was able to reach Le Havre and the train was sent back to Italy to be repaired.|$|E

40|$|<b>Maritime</b> {{passenger}} <b>transport</b> is {{an important}} form of passenger transport, both for business and pleasure, but is often neglected in scientific literature. The main goal {{of this paper is}} to emphasize the importance of <b>maritime</b> passenger <b>transport</b> in Europe. In order to identify its main features and actors, i. e. the leading European countries and ports in the <b>maritime</b> passenger <b>transport,</b> separately for cruise and non-cruise transport, a quantitative analysis was carried out based on the data gathered from Eurostat and CLIA Europe. It was concluded that the features of <b>maritime</b> passenger <b>transport</b> in two main European regions, the Mediterranean and Northern Europe, differ significantly. Therefore, the final analysis of <b>maritime</b> passenger <b>transport</b> in Europe was conducted for each region separately...|$|R
