2500|$|The Danish {{authorities}} {{were able to}} use their more cooperative stance to win important concessions for the country. They continually refused to enter a customs and currency union with Germany. Danes were concerned both about the negative economic effects of the German proposals, as well as the political ones.

The Danish government was also able to stall negotiations over the return of South Jutland to Germany, ban [...] "closed-rank uniformed marches" [...] that would have made nationalist German or Danish Nazi agitation more possible, keep National Socialists out of the government, and hold a relatively free election, with decidedly anti-Nazi results, {{in the middle of the}} war. Danish military officials also had access to sensitive German information, which they delivered to the Allies under government cover. The economic consequences of the occupation were also mitigated by German-Danish cooperation. Inflation rose sharply in the first year of the war, as the German Army spent a large amount of German <b>military</b> <b>currency</b> in Denmark, most importantly on military installations and troop deployments. Due to the Occupation, the National Bank of Denmark was compelled to exchange German currency for Danish notes, effectively granting the Germans a gigantic unsecured loan with only vague promises that the money would eventually be paid, something which never happened.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} a news event {{may become a}} global social myth. In order to track this voyage from the particular to the universal, I developed a theoretical concept of "global iconic events. " I define global iconic events as news events that are covered extensively and remembered ritually by international media. I suggest five narrative aspects to consider in connection with them: (1) their narrative prerequisites; (2) their elevated and interpretative story; (3) their condensation into a simple phrase, a short narrative, and a recognizable visual scene; (4) their competing stories; and (5) their ability to travel across multiple media platforms and changing social and political contexts. I perform textual analysis on media representations from four distinct national contexts (West German, East German, Hungarian, and American) to examine two case studies. With {{the help of the}} central case study, the "fall of the Berlin Wall," I exhibit the successful social construction of a global iconic event. The second case study, the 1956 Hungarian revolution, illuminates some factors, in particular local counter-narration, incoherent and contextual international representation, forgetting, and marginality of the event's location, as instrumental in the failure of an event to become a global iconic event. While the East German border opening on November 9, 1989 was unintentional, confusing, and messy, its global message is not about "luck" or "accident" in history. Incarnated as a global iconic event, the fall of the Berlin Wall has come to communicate the momentary power that the otherwise hopelessly vulnerable individual can have. The event's elevated and interpretative story, condensed into a simple phrase, a short narrative and a recognizable visual scene, provides global civil society with a contemporary social myth. Through recycling, reenactment, possession, memorialization and other embodiments, the event's simple and universal story continues to travel successfully through time, space, and media, inspiring people {{in various parts of the}} world. In conclusion, I emphasize that when we examine the social construction of global iconic events, the stakes are high. I hope that this piece of academic writing will help us understand how powerful stories of events might shape the lives of those generations who come after us all over the world. Because in the end, after common <b>currencies,</b> <b>military</b> alliances, and international courts have failed, stories may well be all we have left to bring hope and unity...|$|R
40|$|Since 1972 Denmark {{has been}} a member of the European Community (EF). In 1993 The Community {{transformed}} into the European Union (EU), and the transition from Community to Union implied new legislations for the future decision-making processes confirmed by the Maastricht Treaty. The provisions of the Treaty stated that decisive powers in some respects were transferred from national parliaments to the European Union Parliament. In Denmark such a hand over of sovereignty is not possible without changing the constitution. And changing the constitution demands the voters to be heard. The Danish voters declined the Maastricht Treaty and subsequently the Danish Government negotiated a special agreement which allowed Denmark to ratify the Treaty with four exemptions within the areas of legal matters, <b>military</b> matters, Union <b>currency</b> (euro) and Union citizenship. In November 2007 the Danish Prime Minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen from the party Venstre declared that it is the intention of the present government that these four exemptions must be given up so that Denmark can again be a full member of the Union. The scope of this thesis is to investigate and analyze the communication that the leading party of the government (Venstre) uses to obtain their goal and the discursive practices they engage. The analytical framework for this thesis is Norman Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis. The framework situates discourse in a broader context of social relations bringing together text analysis, the analysis of processes of text production and consumption and the social analysis of discourse events. Our focus is to uncover whether Venstre try to reproduce or redefine the identity of concepts and thus take up the hegemonic battle of determining the meaning of words, practice and social life. The starting point of our analysis is the Prime Ministers New Year Approach to the Danish people given on 1. January 2008. Further we involve texts from the Party program as well as all published articles on the topic EU-exemptions within our period of investigation; from January first 2008 until the end of February 2008. In the light of our central text, the New Year Approach, we perform text analysis with special focus to modality, transitivity and agents. Further we seek to uncover repeated fragments as well as interdicursivity and intertextuality between our texts as well as into social practice. Methodically we include several approaches, for instance Leif Becker Jensen’s method for text analysis, Stephen Toulmin’s model for analyzing rhetorical arguments and Algirdas Greimas’ actant model for determining positions, relations and functions in the communication. We conclude that Venstre by activating a new “exemption-discourse” is seeking to redefine the understanding of EU, Denmark and the four exemptions. This is done by renaming the exemptions from the vague and I-am-protected “reservation” to the more value-laden and I-am-excluded “exemption”. Also the discourse is characterized by creating new group identities, using modality with high affinity and clearly communicating uniform key roles and players...|$|R

Dollars became more favorable to hold, inflating the local currencies and thwarting plans to stabilize local economies. Contributing to this problem was the fact that troops were being paid in dollars, which they could convert in unlimited amounts to the local currency with merchants at the floating (black market) conversion rate, which was much more favorable to the GIs than the government fixed conversion rate. From this conversion rate imbalance, a black market developed where the servicemen could profit from the more favorable exchange rate.|$|E
