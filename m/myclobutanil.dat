50|$|Necrotic ring spot can {{be managed}} through {{chemical}} and cultural controls. Cultural control includes the use of ammonium sulfate or other acidifying fertilizers to suppress the pathogen by lowering the pH of the soil to between 6.0 and 6.2. The more acidic soil discourages the activity of O. korrae (9) When reducing pH to these levels, additional manganese applications should be undertaken to compensate for lower pH. As of now, {{there are only two}} resistant cultivars of bluegrass, which are ‘Riviera’, and ‘Patriot’ (9). One component of their resistance could be that they are tolerant to low temperature, because the grass is more susceptible to the pathogen under colder temperatures(8). In addition, reducing watering inputs and growing turf on well drained soils can lessen disease symptoms. Many different fungicides are used to control the pathogen, Fenarimol, Propiconazole, <b>Myclobutanil,</b> and Azoxystrobin (8). Historically, Fenarimol and <b>Myclobutanil</b> were predominantly used (14). In a study where diluted pesticides were sprayed throughout infested test plots, Fenarimol was found to be the most effective with a 94.6% reduction of the disease. <b>Myclobutanil</b> also decreased the amount of disease, but only by 37.7% (8). <b>Myclobutanil</b> is generally recognized as a very weakly acting demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide and fenarimol is no longer registered for turf so a number of other DMI fungicides have been employed successfully, including Propiconazole, Tebuconazole, Metconazole and others. Pyraclostrobin and Fluoxastrobin have also been used to control the pathogen.|$|E

It began on the asparagus crops of mostly northeastern states and began to move westward across the country- For each successive year the disease was discovered in new western areas until in 1902 it was reported in California for the first time. Research to control the disease began with Bordeaux mixture experiments around {{the start of the}} 20th century. Copper and sulfur dust were tried as well but their success was very limited. Sulfur was the only one to have much success at all. Rust resistant strains of asparagus were cultivated but by the 1940s and 1950s these strains of asparagus were no longer providing adequate levels of resistance. In the 1950s zineb and mancozeb were developed as the primary means to control rust. Zineb reduced infection by 85% and mancozeb by 97% [...] By 1989 EBDC fungicides had become the most common fungicidal means to control rust on asparagus. However, after the EPA almost cancelled the use of EBDCs on asparagus many processors decided they would not accept EBDC-treated asparagus despite the EPA allowing its use after review. This meant that many growers were left with no registered fungicide to use on asparagus. Since 1990 the EPA has granted exemptions for tebuconazole, <b>myclobutanil,</b> and triadimefon for use on asparagus.|$|E

In {{the second part of the}} study, enantioseparation of hexaconazole, penconazole, <b>myclobutanil,</b> and triadimefon was investigated. Simultaneous enantioseparation of penconazole, <b>myclobutanil,</b> and triadimefon was achieved under acidic condition (pH 3. 0) using 25 mM phosphate buffer, 50 mM SDS, and 30 mM HP-Î³-CD, with Rs greater than 0. 9 whereas, simultaneous enantioseparation of hexaconazole, penconazole, and <b>myclobutanil</b> was successfully achieved under neutral condition (pH 7. 0) using 25 mM phosphate buffer, 40 mM SDS, and 40 mM HP-Î³-CD, with Rs greater than 1. 6. In order to improve detection sensitivity, on-line preconcentration technique was investigated. It was found that sweeping technique as an on-line preconcentration technique improved the detection sensitivity of the enantioseparation of cyproconazole, bromuconazole, and diniconazole by 30 to 60 -fold, with good repeatabilities in the migration time, peak area and peak height were obtained with RSDs in the range of 0. 08 “ 0. 32 %, 0. 03 “ 2. 44 %, and 2. 13 “ 8. 44 % respectively.

The sensitivity of C. truncatum isolates to five DMI fungicides was determined based on mycelial growth inhibition assay. C. truncatum was sensitive to prochloraz, epoxiconazole, and difenoconazole, but not to tebuconazole or <b>myclobutanil.</b> Baseline sensitivity using the 112 C. truncatum isolates was established for the first three effective DMIs. Prochloraz, epoxiconazole, and difenoconazole EC 50 values were 0. 053 ± 0. 023, 1. 956 ± 0. 815, and 1. 027 ± 0. 644 μg/ml, respectively. Eleven stable DMI-resistant mutants all exhibited lower fitness levels than their wild-type parents, suggesting a low risk of DMI resistance in C. truncatum.

Currently, there is no fungicide registered for control of G. fructicola in strawberry in Australia. A series of field trials in Queensland and Victorian strawberry nurseries over two seasons (2013 / 14 to 2014 / 15) evaluated the efficacy of 19 fungicide and biorational products, applied alone or as part of a program (in combination with other products), against powdery mildew and leaf blotch. Our aim was to manage the risk of fungicide resistance by developing disease control programs specifically for use in the strawberry runner nurseries with different activity groups to the fungicides used in strawberry fruit production. Treatments were applied weekly using a knapsack sprayer starting December/January for approximately 16 weeks until prior to harvest of runners in March/April. Runners were randomly selected and rated for the incidence of powdery mildew and leaf blotch prior to harvest. Where single fungicide treatments were applied (2013 / 14), the field trial results identified bupirimate, cyflufenamid, quinoxyfen, proquinazid, azoxystrobin + difenoconazole, as equally or more effective in controlling powdery mildew as the industry standard program of sulphur, <b>myclobutanil</b> and trifloxystrobin. Field trials in 2014 / 15 assessed spray programs that were based on sulphur in different combinations with quinoxyfen, bupirimate, cyflufenamid and/or with reduced applications of <b>myclobutanil</b> and trifloxystrobin. All programs were as effective against powdery mildew as the industry standard program. Azoxystrobin + difenoconazole, prochloraz, and chlorothalonil were the most effective against leaf blotch in trials in 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15. It is anticipated that the coordinated use of different chemistries across the strawberry nursery and fruit industries will reduce the risk of fungicide resistance developing in pathogen populations, and increase the sustainability of disease protection across strawberry crops...|$|E
40|$|Apple scab, {{caused by}} the fungal {{pathogen}} Venturia inaequalis {{is among the most}} prevalent and economically important diseases in commercial apple orchards in regions with temperate climates worldwide. The absence of durable apple scab resistance in the majority of commercially desired cultivars often mandates numerous fungicide applications each season to successfully manage the disease. Highly effective single-site fungicides have enhanced the ability to manage a number of phytopathogenic fungi, including V. inaequalis. Unfortunately the highly specific nature and repetitive use of these fungicides has led to their diminished efficacy and widespread resistance in V. inaequalis. The identification of the prevalence of single-site resistance in populations of V. inaequalis and an understanding of molecular mechanisms of resistance to these fungicides can aid in the rapid detection of fungicide resistance, the deployment of fungicide anti-resistance management strategies, and the development of efficient and effective chemical management programs for apple scab control. In this dissertation, a combination of applied and basic research was implemented to gain further understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with practical resistance to DMI and QoI fungicides in isolates and/or populations of V. inaequalis. Microscopy-aided mycelial growth assays were used to determine sensitivity phenotypes to the DMI fungicides <b>myclobutanil</b> and difenoconazole and to the QoI fungicide trifloxystrobin. The majority of populations of V. inaequalis collected throughout the Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic, and Mid-Western United States were found to have reduced sensitivity or practical resistance to <b>myclobutanil,</b> but not difenoconazole. Illumina sequencing and reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR were used to identify the contribution of target gene overexpression and the presence of upstream repeated elements in <b>myclobutanil</b> and difenoconazole resistance. Another molecular technique, allelespecific quantitative PCR was used to evaluate the role of target gene heteroplasmy in the quantitative resistance response and practical resistance to trifloxystrobin in isolates and populations of V. inaequalis. Additionally, baseline sensitivity of V. inaequalis to three SDHI fungicides was determined, and the sdhB gene, a target for SDHI fungicides, was identified and characterized. In summary, the results of this dissertation contribute to the identification and understanding of mechanisms associated with single-site fungicide resistance in V. inaequalis. 2021 - 02 - 0...|$|E
40|$|Many of the {{original}} Section 18 labels for soybean rust fungicides will expire in November 2007, and fungicides that were granted Section 18 labels in 2004 are now going through EPA for consideration to get a full label for soybean. As of March 2, 2007, soybean residue tolerances were issued for <b>myclobutanil,</b> propiconazole, and trifloxystrobin products, so products with these active ingredients will most likely receive a Section 3 label in 2007.

40|$|Conazoles {{comprise}} {{a class of}} fungicides used in agriculture and as pharmaceutical products. The fungicidal properties of conazoles are due to their inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis. Certain conazoles are tumorigenic in rodents; both propiconazole and triadimefon are hepatotoxic and hepatotumorigenic in mice, while <b>myclobutanil</b> is not a mouse liver tumorigen. As a component of a large-scale study aimed at determining the mode(s) of action for tumorigenic conazoles, we report the results from comparative evaluations of liver and body weights, liver histopathology, cell proliferation, cytochrome P 450 (CYP) activity, and serum cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels after exposure to propiconazole...|$|E
40|$|Mixtures of {{pesticides}} in foodstuffs {{and the environment}} are ubiquitous {{in the developed world}} and although agents are usually exhaustively tested individually, the toxicological implications of pesticide mixtures are underreported. In this study, the effects of two fungicides, fenhexamid and <b>myclobutanil</b> were investigated individually and in combination on two human cell lines, SH-SY 5 Y neuronal cells and U- 251 MG glial cells. After 48. h of incubation with increasing concentrations {{of pesticides}} ranging from 1 to 1000. μM, gene expression profiles were studied in addition to toxicity end points, including cell viability, mitochondrial depolarisation as well as cellular glutathione maintenance. There {{were no significant differences between}} the susceptibility of the two cell lines in terms of cell viability assessment or mitochondrial membrane potential, when agents were administered either individually or in combination. By contrast, in the presence of the fungicides, the SH-SY 5 Y cells showed significantly greater susceptibility to oxidative stress in terms of total thiol depletion in comparison with the astrocytic cells. Treatment with the two pesticides led to significant changes in the cell lines' expression of several genes which regulate cell cycle control and growth (RB 1, TIMP 1) as well as responses to DNA attrition (ATM and CDA 25 A) and control of apoptosis (FAS). There was no evidence in this study that the combination of fenhexamid and <b>myclobutanil</b> was significantly more toxic than individual exposure, although gene expression changes suggested there may be differences in the sub-lethal response of both cell lines to both individual and combined exposure...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the on-line preconcentration and chiral {{separation}} of three chiral triazole fungicides, namely hexaconazole, penconazole and <b>myclobutanil</b> is reported. Simultaneous enantioseparation {{of the three}} triazole fungicides was successfully achieved by using CD-MEKC system containing 40 mM hydroxypropyl-Î³-CD and 50 mM sodium dodecyl sulphate in 25 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3. 0) solution. Stacking with a reverse migrating micelle (SRMM) and sweeping were used as two on-line preconcentration methods to enhance the concentration sensitivity. Results indicate that sweeping-CD-MEKC is better than SRMMCD-MEKC {{in terms of the}} sensitivity enhancement factor (SEF) of the three triazole fungicides. This is the first report on the simultaneous chiral separation of three triazole fungicides by on-line-CD-MEKC method...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{sensitivity}} assays of nine isolates {{belonging to}} five Trichoderma species, to ten demethylation inhibitor fungicides, showed highly {{significant differences among}} both isolates and fungicides. Isolates of T. koningii were the most tolerant to fungicides. Flutriafol, fenarimol and <b>myclobutanil</b> were the least effective in inhibiting growth of Trichoderma isolates. UV mutants resistant to prochloraz or bromuconazole from a wild-type isolate of T. harzianum were obtained. Cross-resistance between prochloraz and bromuconazole was evident {{in four of the}} five representative mutants tested. Some mutants showed reduced growth and sporulation. Overall results suggest a good potential for integration of Trichoderma isolates and DMI-fungicides in integrated plant protection schemes. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Lt...|$|E
40|$|There are no {{therapeutic}} {{treatments for}} canker diseases of grapevine. These diseases can be prevented, however, by protecting dormant pruning wounds from airborne inoculum. A single fungicide application after pruning reduced canker incidence in 159 / 160 cases and canker severity in 16 / 16 cases. Thiophanate-methyl was most effective against Lasiodiplodia theobromae and <b>myclobutanil</b> was effective against Eutypa lata. Both fungicides were effective against Phaeoacremonium aleophilum and Phaeomoniella chlamydospora. Pruning wounds {{were found to}} be most susceptible to canker pathogens in December and least susceptible in March, and late or double pruning was shown to augment fungicide effectiveness in reducing canker disease incidence. Pruning wound susceptibility to canker pathogens was found to decrease significantly three weeks after pruning. The practical implications of these results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of 36 Septoria pyricola single spore isolates, obtained from isolated pear orchards, to carbendazim, bitertanol, flusilazole, <b>myclobutanil,</b> azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin and boscalid, was studied in vitro. Spore suspensions were point-inoculated on media amended with various concentrations of fungicides and the {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MICs) of the fungicides was determined. Most isolates were highly resistant to carbendazim, forming colonies even at concentrations of 100 mg L- 1 of the fungicide. A few isolates failed to form colonies with carbendazim concentrations of 0. 1 and 10 mg L- 1; these isolates were designated carbendazim-sensitive and moderately carbendazim-resistant respectively. The MIC of DMI fungicides was up to 1 mg L- 1 with some isolates, and the mean MICs of bitertanol, flusilazole and <b>myclobutanil</b> were 0. 133 ± 0. 036, 0. 075 ± 0. 044 and 0. 230 ± 0. 038 mg L- 1 respectively. The MIC of the QoI fungicides was up to 0. 1 mg L- 1 with most isolates, but some isolates were 100 -fold less sensitive to azoxystrobin. The mean MICs of azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin were 0. 177 ± 0. 040, 0. 075 ± 0. 035, 0. 067 ± 0. 063, and 0. 073 ± 0. 065 mg L- 1 respectively. Overall, the MIC of boscalid was 1 mg L- 1, and the mean MIC was 0. 111 ± 0. 044 mg L- 1. The ED 50 values of representative isolates are also presented, as determined by colony formation with dispersed spore inoculation on a medium amended with fungicides. The {{results show that the}} benzimidazoles are ineffective against S. pyricola isolates in Greece and suggest that the future effectiveness of the DMIs is at risk...|$|E
40|$|A chiral {{selector}} of cellulose- 2, 3 -bis(3, 5 -dimethylphenylcarbamate) (CBDMPC) was synthesized by reacting 3, 5 -dimethylphenyl isocyanate with {{microcrystalline cellulose}} dissolved in an ionic liquid of 1 -allyl- 3 -methyl-imidazolium chloride (AMIMCl). The obtained chiral selector was effectively characterized by infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis and 1 H NMR. The selector was reacted with 3 -aminopropylsilanized silica gel and the CBDMPC bonded chiral stationary phase (CSP) was obtained. Chromatographic {{evaluation of the}} prepared CSPs was conducted by high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) and baseline separation of three typical fungicides including hexaconazole, metalaxyl and <b>myclobutanil</b> was achieved using n-hexane/isopropanol as the mobile phase with a flow rate 1. 0 mL/min. Experimental results also showed that AMIMCl could be recycled easily and reused {{in the preparation of}} CSPs as an effective reaction media...|$|E

We developed assays for inhibition of spore adhesion in 96 -well microtiter plates by using sulforhodamine B staining {{to quantify the}} adherent spores. In both organisms, fungicides that inhibited germination strongly inhibited spore adhesion, with 50 % effective concentrations (EC 50 s) comparable to those for inhibition of germination. In contrast, fungicides that acted after germination in B. cinerea inhibited spore adhesion to microtiter plates only at concentrations much higher than their EC 50 s for inhibition of mycelial growth. Similarly, in P. recondita the ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors <b>myclobutanil</b> and fenbuconazole acted after germination and did not inhibit spore adhesion. The assays provide a rapid, high-throughput alternative to traditional spore germination assays and may be applicable to other fungi...|$|E
40|$|Potential {{harmful effects}} of {{pesticides}} include risks to human health of workers involved in the wet spray application in cultivated areas. Inhalation exposure depends on several factors including pesticide concentrations in the respirable fraction of airborne particulate matter (PM 4). To ensure {{a high level of}} protection, the use of tractors with cabins provides protection against dust, aerosols, and vapors. Since tractors not providing maximum protection are still in use, PM 4 was sampled during spreading operations in agricultural fields inside and outside tractor cabins. Sample preparation technique based on accelerated solvent extraction and solid-phase extraction cleanup was optimized before analysis of nine pesticides in PM 4. Meptyldinocap, deltamethrin, <b>myclobutanil,</b> fluopyram, methoxyfenozide, dimethomorph, fluopicolide, cyflufenamid, and metrafenone were simultaneously determined by high-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI–MS–MS).
