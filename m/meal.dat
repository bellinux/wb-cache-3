The company introduced its child-oriented product line in North America {{during the summer}} of 1990 with an advertising program called the Burger King Kid's Club. In the United States, the <b>meal</b> is called the Kids Club <b>Meal</b> and it is primarily positioned against the popular Happy <b>Meal</b> from McDonald's. The <b>meal</b> includes an entrée, a side order, beverage, and a toy. The toy is usually a product tie-in with a movie or popular television show.

Like {{rumination}} syndrome, patients with gastroparesis often bring up food following the ingestion of a <b>meal.</b> Unlike rumination, gastroparesis causes vomiting (in contrast to regurgitation) of food, {{which is not}} being digested further, from the stomach. This vomiting occurs several hours after a <b>meal</b> is ingested, preceded by nausea and retching, and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit.|$|E

30|$|To expand {{upon the}} family <b>meals</b> {{research}} literature, {{we examined the}} sociodemographic characteristics associated {{with the number of}} <b>meals</b> eaten per week and the duration (i.e., number of minutes) of <b>meals</b> among a sample of parents in a major city in New England. Because research has shown that culture and background influence family <b>meals</b> (Ochs and Shohet 2006; Trends 2013), we specifically examined differences in family <b>meals</b> by race/ethnicity and parental nativity. We hypothesized that those born outside the U.S. would eat more <b>meals</b> with their children per week and for more minutes per day than those born in the U.S. This study contributes to a comprehensive view of family <b>meals</b> and builds a foundation so that more focused research into the mechanisms of family <b>meals</b> can be conducted.|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{different}} patterns of fish consumption {{is an important}} component of the assessment of risk from contaminants in fish. While there have been extensive studies of fish consumption in Western cultures, less attention has been devoted to the role of fish and meat in the diets of people in other cultures. A survey of 212 people living in Singapore was conducted to examine the relative importance of fish, shellfish, and other meat in their diets and to ascertain whether there were differences as a function of age, income, education or gender. As expected, fish and shellfish played an important role in their daily diets. On average, people ate fish in about 10 <b>meals</b> a week, chicken for eight <b>meals,</b> and shrimp and pork for about six <b>meals</b> each. While nearly 8 % never ate fish, 18 % ate fish at all 21 <b>meals</b> a week and over 20 % ate shellfish for all 21 <b>meals.</b> Income explained about 14 % of the variation in the number of fish <b>meals</b> consumed, and age explained about 8 % of the variation in number of chicken <b>meals</b> per week. There were no gender differences in the number of <b>meals</b> of each type. People less than 26 years old ate significantly more pork, chicken, and other meat <b>meals</b> and fewer shellfish <b>meals</b> than older people. People with higher incomes ate significantly more fish <b>meals</b> than those with lower incomes. Chinese individuals ate significantly more <b>meals</b> of pork, chicken, and other meat than other ethnic groups, and they ate only 26 % of their <b>meals</b> at home, while others ate 33 % of their <b>meals</b> at home. The data indicate a great deal of variation in the number of <b>meals</b> of fish, shellfish, and other meats eaten by the people interviewed, making dietary and risk assessment...|$|R
