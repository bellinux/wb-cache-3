5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in <b>my</b> <b>previous</b> two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E

What I meant was I am {{taking a break from}} being told what to do. ... It's cool when you look at someone and don't know whether they are at work or play since it's all the same to them. The things I've been doing for work lately have been so much fun, because it's not like work to me anymore. I've been even more 'hands on' in my management and the business side of things, and I feel more in control than ever.|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} partly autobiographical. Like her narrator, Müller {{comes from the}} German-speaking {{minority}} in Romania, the Banat Swabians, with a father who had been former SS man during World War II. Trained as a teacher, she lost her position after refusing {{to cooperate with the}} Securitate. She emigrated to Germany in 1987. In a 1998 interview she mentioned that real persons can be recognized in some of her characters, including one in The Land of Green Plums: [...] "That [...] was already the case in <b>my</b> <b>previous</b> book [...] Because my best girlfriend died young, and because she had betrayed me, and because I had to despise her and could not stop loving her." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for Complex, Beyoncé expressed dissatisfaction with contemporary radio. She intended 4 to help change that status, commenting, [...] "Figuring {{out a way to}} get R back on the radio is challenging... With 4, I tried to mix R from the '70s and the '90s with rock 'n' roll and a lot of horns to create something new and exciting. I wanted musical changes, bridges, vibrata, live instrumentation and classic songwriting." [...] On her website she wrote, [...] "The album is definitely an evolution. It's bolder than the music on <b>my</b> <b>previous</b> albums because I'm bolder. The more mature I become and the more life experiences I have, the more I have to talk about. I really focused on songs being classics, songs that would last, songs that I could sing when I'm 40 and when I'm 60."

500|$|Burroughs {{continued}} to publicly disagree with Long and his allies, {{and a number}} of his essays dedicated to [...] "sham nature history" [...] were collected in the volume Ways of Nature, published in late 1905. Admitting that his authorial tone had changed since 1903, he wrote in the preface that [...] "My readers will find this volume quite a departure in certain ways from the tone and spirit of <b>my</b> <b>previous</b> books, especially in regard to the subject of animal intelligence. Heretofore I have made the most of every gleam of intelligence of bird or four-footed beast that came under my observation, often, I fancy, making too much of it, and giving the wild creatures credit for more 'sense' than they really possessed." [...] Mabel Osgood Wright weighed in on the debate in a 1905 essay titled [...] "Nature as a Field for Fiction", in which she criticized both sides. Believing that nature writing could imbue animal characters with human qualities in order to better connect with the reader on an emotional level, Wright argued that nature writing should nonetheless strive to be factual and not fantastical.|$|E
500|$|Maria Amélia and her mother, who had {{accompanied}} her, disembarked on 31 August in Funchal, {{the capital of}} Madeira. The entire town greeted her joyfully, and a crowd followed the princess to her new home. She adored the island and told her mother: [...] "If I one day recover <b>my</b> <b>previous</b> robust health, isn't that so mommy, we will stay {{a long time in}} this island. We will make long excursions in the mountains, we will find new paths, just as we did in Stein!" [...] But her health worsened, {{and by the end of}} November, all hope was gone. By the beginning of 1853, the princess was bedridden, and she knew death was approaching: [...] "My strength diminishes from day to day; I can feel it... we are reaching the beginning of the end." [...] A little after midnight in the early hours of 4 February, a priest administered the last rites. Maria Amélia tried to comfort her mother: [...] "Do not cry... let God's will be done; may He come to my aid in my last hour; may He console my poor mother!" [...] She died later that morning at around 04:00.|$|E
500|$|In a DVD {{review for}} the {{individual}} episode DVD release Spongicus, Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict said that [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>previous</b> SpongeBob reviews I have commented that series has lost its edge. This offering does nothing to change my opinion. But what the heck do I know? Clearly, the show continues to maintain a large following and the franchise is a license to print money for Nickelodeon." [...] The DVD consists of eight episodes and praised the episodes [...] "Not Normal" [...] and [...] "Gone" [...] by describing them [...] "the best episode on the disc" [...] and [...] "a decent episode", respectively. Also from DVD Verdict, Gordon Sullivan, on the DVD release To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants, said that [...] " [...] a solid collection of SpongeBob SquarePants episodes." [...] He added that [...] "My only serious problem with this set is that it's only eight episodes long; a more complete season-style release would be more efficient. On the technical front everything is fine, with the bright, solid colors of Bikini Bottom shining through clearly and all the dialogue and effects clear and detailed." [...] Sullivan gave the episodes [...] "The Splinter", [...] "Slide Whistle Stooges", and [...] "The Krabby Kronicle" [...] an 8/10 rating, while [...] "Boating Buddies" [...] received the lowest rating with 3/10.|$|E

500|$|Sugababes {{performed}} [...] "Ugly" [...] at the V Festival in 2006 {{as part of}} a set list, {{which included}} Hole in the Head, Red Dress and Push the Button. Reviewers from The Sun said that the Sugababes [...] "proved both that pop can work at festivals and that losing Mutya has not caused them to miss a beat". In 2008, they performed the song at the same event in the JJB Champion Arena, {{as part of a}} set list which included Push the Button and About You Now. The performance received positive reviews, with a reviewer from MTV UK calling it [...] "a highlight of our festival in the JJB Arena". In August 2007, former group member Mutya Buena, who left the band shortly following the single's release, performed the song at the V Festival in Chelmsford; before playing it, she stated: [...] "This song is one I sang with <b>my</b> <b>previous</b> group... It's called 'Ugly'". On 18 September 2007, Sugababes performed an acoustic version of [...] "Ugly" [...] at the Indig02 as part of a set list, which included such songs as [...] "Freak Like Me", [...] "Round Round", [...] "In the Middle", [...] "Red Dress" [...] and [...] "Too Lost In You". Nick Levine of Digital Spy felt the performance [...] "proves that no member's a slacker in the trilling department".|$|E
500|$|On December 2, 2003, Spears {{announced}} {{through her}} official website US concerts {{to support her}} fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). The tour would kick off on March 2 in San Diego, California, at iPayOne Center. However, Spears released a statement saying, [...] "I'm especially looking forward to bringing my tour to new markets and performing in front of fans {{that may not have}} had the opportunity to see any of <b>my</b> <b>previous</b> tours." [...] On January 12, 2004, four dates were announced in Glasgow, Manchester, London and Birmingham, her first UK dates in four years. After the beginning of the North American leg, Spears announced a summer leg in the United States in June as well as a European leg starting on April 27 in London and ending on June 5 at Rock in Rio Lisboa. It was also rumored to visit Latin America and Asia later in the year. The Onyx Hotel Tour was originally going to be called In the Zone Tour. On February 17, 2004, a San Diego clothing manufacturer of the same name sued Spears for $10 million and banned her from using the trademark. On May 17, 2004, a hotel named Onyx Hotel opened in Boston, Massachusetts. Kimpton Hotels & Restaurant Group had come up with the name two years before the tour was developed. Spears and the Kimpton group decided to promote the hotel by featuring a room named The Britney Spears Foundation Room. It was designed by Spears's mother, Lynne, reflecting Spears's personality and taste. The room opened six weeks later and a portion of the fee was destined to the Britney Spears Foundation.|$|E
500|$|A + No Poder is {{dedicated}} to Guzmán's daughter Frida Sofia. The album includes twelve tracks: eleven written by Guzmán and Pagán, with additional writers for three of them. [...] "Adiós" [...] was co-written by Carlos Efrén Reyes, [...] "Esta Noche" [...] was co-written by Karenka and Reyli Barba, and [...] "A Más No Poder" [...] was co-written Sarah Lenore. Another track, [...] "Una Canción de Amor", was entirely written by Argentinean singer-songwriter Alejandro Lerner. [...] "Adiós" [...] features Puerto-Rican reggaeton performer Farruko. [...] "Te Esperaré" [...] is a ballad, and [...] "Malvada", {{a story about a}} femme fatale, has country music undertones with a harmonica that resembles Mexican band El Tri. [...] "Malvada" [...] and [...] "This is Too Much Rock and Roll" [...] are rock songs, with the latter reminds of Soy, an album released by the singer in 2001. [...] "Esta Noche" [...] is a pop/funk track with reggae influences. [...] "A Más No Poder" [...] has sexual connotations in its lyrics and as stated by Ángel Rodríguez of ADN Informativo, [...] "brings back memories when Guzmán was produced by Miguel Blasco in the 90's". [...] "Mi Debilidad" [...] is a pop/rock song, while [...] "No Puedo Parar" [...] is a heavy metal track. [...] "Qué Ironía" [...] is a rock ballad that recalls Guzmán greatest hits such as [...] "Mi Peor Error". About the songs included, Guzmán stated to Tabasco Hoy: [...] "In recent years I experienced many good and bad things, so I thought, why not transform them into songs. And so it began to take shape this new album, which I think is more intelligent, mature and planned than <b>my</b> <b>previous</b> work".|$|E

2500|$|Relationship talk is a {{remediation}} {{strategy that}} focuses on discussing the transgression {{in the context of}} the relationship. [...] Aune et al. (1998) identified two types of relationship talk, relationship invocation and metatalk.

[...] For example, “We are too committed to this relationship to let it fail.”, or “Our relationship is so much better than any of <b>my</b> <b>previous</b> relationships.”. [...] Metatalk involves discussing the effect of the transgression on the relationship.
