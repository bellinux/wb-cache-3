2500|$|The {{prototype}} Model 34 {{had accumulated}} more than 200 hours of test flying when the reinforced belly was validated in a wheels-up landing.

40|$|The {{discovery}} that AC elements coordinated {{the regulation of}} genes belonging to the entire lignin biosynthetic pathway was the first breakthrough in understanding how lignin biosynthesis is regulated. Since then, tremendous {{progress has been made}} in the identification and characterization of many transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the genes of the phenylpropanoid branch pathway leading to lignin. A major breakthrough consisted in the discovery of a hierarchical transcriptional network regulating the biosynthesis of lignified secondary walls (SWs) in Arabidopsis. The NAC TFs (VND/NST/SND) work as the first layer of <b>master</b> <b>switches</b> activating the whole SW biosynthetic network through the regulation of a cascade of downstream TFs. Among these, MYB 46 / 83 act as a second layer of <b>master</b> <b>switches.</b> Recent findings, however, reveal that the regulation of SW formation is far more complex than initially thought, involving both positive and negative regulators, dual function regulators, feedback loops, combinatorial complexes and cross talk between pathways. Finally, because of the great potential that lignocellulosic biomass represents for the production of bioenergy, there is a great interest in further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of lignified SW and subsequently applying this knowledge to improve their saccharification potential for the generation of biofuels...|$|R
40|$|Species from {{productive}} and unproductive habitats differ inherently in their relative growth rate (RGR) {{and a wide}} range of correlated quantitative traits. We investigated the genetic basis of this trait complex, and specifically assessed whether it is under the control of just one or a few genes that can act as <b>master</b> <b>switches</b> by simultaneously affecting a range of traits in the complex. To address this problem, we crossed two Hordeum spontaneum lines originating from two habitats that differ in productivity. The F 3 offspring, in which parental alleles are present in different combinations due to recombination and segregation, was analysed for RGR and its underlying components (leaf area ratio, unit leaf rate, photosynthesis, respiration), {{as well as a number}} of other physiological and morphological parameters. For this intra-specific comparison, we found a complex of positively and negatively correlated traits, which was quite similar to what is generally observed across species. A quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis showed three major and one minor QTL for RGR. Most other variables of the growth-trait complex showed fewer QTLs that were typically scattered over various locations on the genome. Thus, at least in H. spontaneum, we found no evidence for regulation of the trait complex by one or two <b>master</b> <b>switches.</b> [KEYWORDS: Specific leaf area; Unit leaf rate; Quantitative trait loci; Trait complex; Photosynthesis...|$|R

5000|$|In 1976 Stommelen had the honour {{to drive}} the maiden race of the Porsche 936 at the 300 km Nürburgring race. With a black body and without the air-intake, the 936 of this race {{became known as the}} black widow. He {{qualified}} second, between the factory Renault Alpine A442 of Patrick Depailler and Jean-Pierre Jabouille in first and third. The Renault team was eager to win at Porsche's home soil. On race-day in heavy rain, Stommelen managed to overtake the Renault in front right after the start. Now in the lead, he rushed towards the Nordkehre, braked and let deliberately room for the Renaults in pursuit to overtake. The Renaults, wanting to take back the lead after 2 of 300 km, rushed past Stommelen into the water puddles and crashed into the catch-fences in tandem, with Stommelen taking back the lead again. This led to the saying [...] "On the Nordschleife, you can never brake later than Rolf Stommelen!". After the sixth lap, the throttle cable of the 936 stuck in the [...] "open" [...] position. But instead of giving up, Stommelen continued the race by turning off the <b>master</b> <b>switch</b> at the bends to brake, and turning on the <b>master</b> <b>switch</b> again after the bends to accelerate {{throughout the rest of the}} race, taking second place at the end of the race.|$|E
30|$|Fibrosis, {{one of the}} key {{characters}} in ARVD/C, is predominantly featured with the excessive and abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components (Uitto and Kouba, 2000). The pro-fibrotic protein—transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and its target factor—connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) are considered as <b>master</b> <b>switches</b> to trigger the fibrotic program (Verrecchia and Mauviel, 2007). They initiate the SMAD signaling pathway that ultimately leads to the activation and proliferation of fibroblasts, which deposit extracellular matrix into the surrounding connective tissues. Under pathological conditions, cardiac fibroblasts are activated and transformed into myofibroblasts, which secrete exceeded ECM for cardiac fibrosis, resulting in cardiac stiffness, adverse myocardial remodeling and heart failure (Weber et al., 2013).|$|R

30|$|In Arabidopsis, a {{detailed}} transcriptional regulation mechanism of SCWs biosynthesis has been reported. A transcriptional network comprising two large family transcription factors (TFs), NAC and MYB, {{are involved in}} SCWs biosynthesis (Zhong and Ye, 2015). In this transcriptional network, a group of NAC family TFs, including NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR 1 (NST 1), NST 2, NST 3 (also called as SND 1, SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN 1), VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 6 (VND 6), and VND 7, function as the top-level <b>master</b> <b>switches</b> of SCWs biosynthesis in fibers and/or vessels (Zhong and Ye, 2015). These factors directly regulate {{the expression of a}} battery of downstream TFs, including SND 2, SND 3, MYB 20, MYB 42, MYB 46, MYB 52, MYB 54, MYB 58, MYB 63, MYB 83, MYB 85 and MYB 103. Of these, MYB 46 and its close homolog MYB 83 act as the secondary-layer <b>master</b> <b>switches</b> to regulate SCWs biosynthesis (Hussey et al., 2013). MYB 46 and MYB 83 also regulate the expression of the direct targets of SND 1 and its homologs, NST 1, NST 2, VND 6 and VND 7 (McCarthy et al., 2009; Zhong et al., 2007). All of these NAC and MYB TFs collectively regulate the biosynthetic genes for cellulose, xylan and lignin. The SCWs NAC family TFs activate the downstream targets through binding to a 19 base pair (bp) sequence, known as SCWs NAC-binding element (SNBE) (McCarthy et al., 2014; Zhong et al., 2010). MYB 46 and MYB 83 bind to a 7  bp consensus sequence, termed as SCWs MYB-responsive element (SMRE) to regulate the expression of target genes (Zhong and Ye, 2012).|$|R
