40|$|This volume {{explores the}} ways in which <b>music</b> <b>scenes</b> are not merely {{physical}} spaces for the practice of collective musical life but are also inscribed with and enacted through the articulation of cultural memory and emotional geography. The book draws on empirical data collected in cites throughout Australia. In terms of understanding the relationship between <b>music</b> <b>scenes</b> and participants, much of the existing popular music literature tends to avoid one key aspect of scene: its predominant past-tense and memory-based nature. Nascent <b>music</b> <b>scenes</b> may be emergent and on-going but their articulation in the present is often based on past events, ideas and histories. There is a noticeable gap between the literature concerning popular music ethnography and the growing body of work on cultural memory and emotional geography. This book is a study of the conceptual formation and use of <b>music</b> <b>scenes</b> by participants. It is also an investigation of the structures underpinning <b>music</b> <b>scenes</b> more generally...|$|R
40|$|This paper applies a multi-layered {{conceptualisation}} {{of place}} {{to the analysis of}} particular <b>music</b> <b>scenes</b> in the Netherlands, 1960 - 2010. We focus on: the clustering of music-related activities in locations; the delineation of spatially tied <b>music</b> <b>scenes,</b> based on a shared identity, reproduced over time through music practices and memory work; and the scale of interconnections in music practices. Using a variety of data sources (music industry locational data from 2011; pop chart entries, analysed by artist location, music genre, and social network ties; popular music history books; the Canon of Dutch Popular Music, published in 2007), we study the development of <b>music</b> <b>scenes</b> in the country. Our findings reveal that different dimensions of place come together in different combinations in <b>music</b> <b>scenes</b> in the Netherlands, allowing us to highlight three models: the big city; the infrastructure and media model; and the niche model. While we highlight the relative importance of specific locational and economic indicators, we also note the strength of memory work and narratives in legitimising certain local <b>music</b> <b>scenes</b> and supporting their endurance through time...|$|R
