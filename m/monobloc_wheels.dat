50|$|Forged {{wheels are}} {{especially}} made here; in October 2010, DSP licensed technology from the Ukrainian manufacturer Interpipe {{which would allow}} it to make 955mm <b>monobloc</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|E
50|$|Within weeks, all {{wheels of}} similar design were {{replaced}} with <b>monobloc</b> <b>wheels.</b> The entire German railway network was checked for similar arrangements of switches close to possible obstacles.|$|E
5000|$|The HP2 Sport is fitted as {{standard}} with a quick shifter, Ohlins suspension and many carbon fibre body parts. Front brake calipers are Brembo [...] "race-spec" [...] <b>Monobloc,</b> <b>wheels</b> are lightweight forged aluminium, and tyres are Metzeler race compound items.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>monobloc</b> <b>wheel</b> design, cracks could also form {{on the inside of}} the tyre.|$|R
40|$|In the {{contribution}} {{a method of}} measurement and dynamic analysis of the recent operational tests of the <b>monobloc</b> <b>wheel</b> with/without damping elements is presented. On the basis of time-frequency analysis of operational vibration and experimental modal analysis of the wheel its dynamic behavior is described. The vibro-acoustic coupling is analyzed from the comparisons of vibration and sound pressure spectrograms. At passing the curve, the formation and modal-frequency composition of squealing noise is observed and there are identified vibrational modes that mostly contribute to noise emission into surrounding. For quantitative comparison of individual wheel solutions the third octave analysis is used...|$|R
40|$|Bogie {{architecture}} (solid axles or independently rotating <b>wheels,</b> <b>monobloc</b> or resilient <b>wheels)</b> has {{a fundamental}} {{impact on the}} contact forces exchanged at wheel-rail interface, especially when considering small radius curves, which are typical of urban tramways. The paper investigates how the contact forces change depending on the adopted bogie architecture, by means of multibody simulation of tramcar behaviour during curve negotiation...|$|R
5000|$|The ICE 1 trains were {{originally}} equipped with single-cast wheelsets, known as <b>Monobloc</b> <b>wheels.</b> Once in service {{it soon became}} apparent that this design could, {{as a result of}} metal fatigue and out-of-round conditions, result in resonance and vibration at cruising speed. Passengers noticed this particularly in the restaurant car, where there were reports of loud vibrations in the dinnerware and of glasses [...] "creeping" [...] across tables.|$|E
50|$|The {{inquiry that}} {{followed}} established {{the root causes}} very quickly. The tyre was on an old carriage and was of an obsolete design. The fracture started at a rivet hole, possibly by metal fatigue, {{although it was not}} recognised as such by the Inquiry. The weather was very cold that day, with snow blanketing the fields and very low freezing temperatures, another factor that hastened the tyre failure. The Railway Inspectorate recommended that the railway companies adopt Mansell wheels, a type of wooden composite wheel, as the design had a better safety record than the alternatives. There had been a long history of failed wheels involved in serious accidents, especially in the previous decade. The problem of broken wheels was not resolved until cast steel <b>monobloc</b> <b>wheels</b> were introduced.|$|E
50|$|A train wheel or {{rail wheel}} {{is a type}} of wheel {{specially}} designed for use on rail tracks. A rolling component is typically pressed onto an axle and mounted directly on a rail car or locomotive or indirectly on a bogie (UK), also called a truck (North America). Wheels are cast or forged (wrought) and are heat-treated to have a specific hardness. New wheels are trued, using a lathe, to a specific profile before being pressed onto an axle. All wheel profiles need to be periodically monitored to ensure proper wheel-rail interface. Improperly trued wheels increase rolling resistance, reduce energy efficiency and may create unsafe operation. A railroad wheel typically consists of two main parts: the wheel itself, and the tire (or tyre) around the outside. A rail tire is usually made from steel, and is typically heated and pressed onto the wheel, where it remains firmly as it shrinks and cools. <b>Monobloc</b> <b>wheels</b> do not have encircling tires, while resilient rail wheels have a resilient material, such as rubber, between the wheel and tire.|$|E
5000|$|... i-move: {{a special}} edition run of 70 Fortwo cabrios, based on the Passion cabrio specs with Brabus <b>Monobloc</b> VI <b>wheels,</b> leather {{interior}} trim, Lite White panels, an iPod cradle with special edition 20Gb 3G iPod, and an aluminium name plate on the dash confirmed its special edition status.|$|R
50|$|Colonel Pringle of the Railway Inspectorate found part of {{the broken}} tyre 50 yd away in a field, the {{left-hand}} leading wheel of the engine having broken. The tread had broken from a large internal blow hole. The defect probably formed during the steel casting operation, and became critical as the tread was worn away. The tyre {{had been made in}} 1920, and had run over 100000 mi before failure. All the other wheels from the same batch were removed from service and broken up, but without finding any cavities in the treads. Pringle also showed how tyre fractures had decreased over the years. In 1880, there were 1238 broken tyres, 577 ten years later and by 1900, the number had dropped to 234. The majority were found on wagons, but by 1920, there were only 20 wheel failures. The drop in failure rate was due to the introduction of the <b>monobloc</b> steel <b>wheel</b> and better inspection and maintenance methods.|$|R
40|$|Current {{investigations}} {{concentrate on}} {{the relation between the}} microstructural gradients in the wheel rim and tire cross-sections and the depending local fatigue behaviour. The microstructural gradients are a conse-quence of the industrial heat treatment {{and the size of the}} components. The specimens were machined from defined depth positions from original <b>monobloc</b> <b>wheels</b> and tires of the UIC-qualities R 7 /B 6 (UIC: Interna-tional Railway Union). Stress- and total-strain-controlled experiments were performed on servo-hydraulic testing systems to determine cyclic deformation, stress-strain and S,N-curves. In addition to mechanical stress-strain (σ,ε) hysteresis measurements, the changes of the specimen temperature ∆T and voltage ∆U due to plastic deformation processes were regarded. The measured values are based on physical processes and therefore show a strong interrelation with the underlying fatigue process. The substitution of the plastic strain amplitude εa,p by ∆T or ∆U leads to cyclic stress-temperature- (σa,∆T-) or stress-voltage- (σa,∆U-) curves, according to Morrow. ∆T and ∆U can also be used similar to εa,p for a lifetime prediction according to Man-son/Coffin. Additionally with these data S,N-curves can be specified according to Basquin. Light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy allow to interpret the measured physical data using the microstructural details. ...|$|E
