25|$|In {{parts of}} the MAX system, {{particularly}} in central Portland and Hillsboro, <b>MAX</b> <b>trains</b> run on surface streets. Except on the Portland Transit Mall, trains run in reserved lanes closed to other motorized vehicles. On the Transit Mall, trains operate on the same lanes as TriMet buses (although <b>MAX</b> <b>trains</b> have traffic priority). Elsewhere, MAX runs within its own exclusive right-of-way, in street medians, alongside freeways, and on former freight railroad lines.|$|R

In 2005, a stabbing occurred at the stop, and in 2007 a rider forced off the MAX by TriMet then attempted to assault someone at the neighboring apartment complex.|$|R
50|$|<b>MAX</b> <b>trains</b> {{passing through}} the light rail/Portland Streetcar {{junction}} have priority over streetcar traffic, though both generally move with the traffic flow. In addition, {{there is also a}} switch to bring streetcars onto the MAX line. On a rainy day, one can see sparks when either type of train pantograph hits the electrical wire junction.|$|R

[...] Light-rail (interurban) service did cross the Hawthorne Bridge until 1956.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare mood states in {{distance}} and sprint trained swimmers and observe how these moods relate to performance and change throughout the swim season. Participants from the ECU swim team completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and Athlete Engagement Questionnaire (AEQ) at baseline, mid-season, <b>max</b> <b>training</b> and taper portions of the competitive season. Meets that fell within two weeks of an administered questionnaire were used to calculate performance as a percentage of the swimmer’s best in-season time. There were changes over time in the POMS total mood disturbance (TMD) scores and fatigue subscale, where team averages in TMD and fatigue peaked in mid-season and declined after the taper period to values much lower than observed at baseline. The only significant difference observed with a Time * Training Type Interaction was in feelings of fatigue. Sprint and mid-distance swimmers were more fatigued than distance swimmers at pre-season and <b>max</b> <b>training.</b> All groups had similar values at mid-season and taper. Significant changes in the dedication and enthusiasm components of Athlete Engagement (AE) were found over time. All groups experienced lower values o...|$|R

Three strangers {{stepped in to}} defend two young girls from racial slurs on the Portland, OR <b>MAX</b> <b>train.</b> Sadly, two men were killed {{and the other was}} wounded for {{standing}} up to hate speech. A crowdfunding campaign was created to help the girls heal from this trauma. The surviving defender posted a Facebook Live video that went viral, urging people to support the young girls through the YouCaring fundraiser, which raised $148,675 for basic necessities and mental health services.|$|R
50|$|Tokyo Station {{opened on}} December 20, 1914 with four platforms; two serving {{electric}} <b>trains</b> (<b>current</b> Yamanote/Keihin-Tohoku Line platforms) and two serving non-electric <b>trains</b> (<b>current</b> Tōkaidō Line platforms). The Chūō Main Line extension {{to the station}} was completed in 1919 and originally stopped at the platform now used by northbound Yamanote/Keihin-Tōhoku trains. During this early era, the station only had gates on the Marunouchi side, with the north side serving as an exit and the south side serving as an entrance.|$|R

25|$|Hop Fastpass card {{readers are}} located on each MAX station {{platform}} {{in preparation for the}} mid-2017 launch of the regional e-fare system. They will enable riders to pay their fare by tapping one of the card readers just before boarding a <b>MAX</b> <b>train.</b> Additionally, as part of the MAX Orange Line, the first turnstiles in the MAX system are being installed at the Southeast Bybee Boulevard and Southeast Park Avenue stations, to be activated with the e-fare system in 2017. This pilot project will determine the feasibility of fare gates at other stations.|$|R
50|$|The station sits at {{the west}} end of the Tilikum Crossing bridge. It {{consists}} of four tracks and two island platforms. The outer lanes are used by <b>MAX</b> <b>trains</b> and the inner lanes are used by the Portland Streetcar's Loop Service and buses. SW Moody Avenue, including the Portland Streetcar NS Line, cross the transit way just west of the station; there, the Loop Service merges with the NS Line and both share stops just to the north. East of the station, the Streetcar tracks merge with the MAX tracks to cross the Tilikum Crossing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station has}} two side platforms. To the {{northeast}} of the station {{is one of the}} facilities where <b>MAX</b> <b>trains</b> are stored and serviced, called Elmonica Yard, or [...] "Elmo Yard" [...] for short. As a result, most trains in the morning start here, and go west to Hillsboro's Hatfield Government Center station before heading to Gresham's Cleveland Avenue station, and service {{at the end of the}} day splits between terminating here or Merlo Road/Southwest 158th Avenue, and Hillsboro's Hatfield Government Center station and returning eastward to the yard.|$|R

500|$|Other {{features}} include false chimneys and copper roofing {{on the main}} building {{that serves as the}} passenger shelter for people waiting for buses or westbound <b>MAX</b> <b>trains.</b> There is also a passenger cover on the single island platform between the two tracks and an additional cover for waiting bus passengers. Hillsboro Central has bike lockers and is handicapped-accessible, but does not have a park-and-ride lot. The station is a hub for bus services in Hillsboro and connections to Cornelius and Forest Grove to the west. This station is served by the following bus lines: [...] 46-North Hillsboro, 47-Baseline/Evergreen, 48-Cornell, and 57-TV Hwy/Forest Grove.|$|R
50|$|The {{average daily}} traffic in 2000 was 23,100 {{vehicles}} (including many TriMet buses), 200 <b>MAX</b> <b>trains,</b> 40 freight and Amtrak trains, and 500 bicycles. The construction of the lower-deck walkway connected to the Eastbank Esplanade resulted in {{a sharp increase in}} bicycle traffic, with over 2,100 daily bicycle crossings in 2005. MAX traffic across the Steel has tripled since 2000, when only the Gresham-Hillsboro line (now the Blue Line) was using the bridge, to 605 daily crossings (weekdays) as of 2012. This resulted from the addition of three more MAX lines during that period: the Red, Yellow, Green Lines.|$|R
50|$|OMSI/Southeast Water is a {{light rail}} station on the MAX Orange Line, located at 2210 Southeast 2nd Place on the east foot of the Tilikum Crossing bridge in Portland, Oregon. Like South Waterfront/SW Moody Station {{on the west side}} of the Willamette River, it {{consists}} of two island platforms. <b>MAX</b> <b>trains</b> stop on the outside of the platforms, while TriMet buses stop on the inner lanes. Just northwest of the platforms is a Portland Streetcar stop served by the A and B Loop lines. The station is named after the nearby Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.|$|R

50|$|An {{investigation}} by several local Portland news outlets found {{that several of}} the MAX Light Rail ticket machines have extremely high failure rates. Many riders have claimed that they have received a fare evasion citation after boarding the <b>MAX</b> <b>train</b> without a fare after they have attempted to pay for a ticket. The official statement from TriMet is to ride to the next MAX station, de-board the train and pay for a ticket there and wait for the next train. This response has been deemed unacceptable both by riders and bus/rail operators. TriMet has begun replacing all of its older machines with newer machines, and cites a 50% drop in complaints.|$|R
50|$|The {{neighborhood}} is accessible using public transportation.TriMet buses and <b>MAX</b> <b>trains</b> provide frequent {{service in the}} district, {{as well as a}} commuter express bus route form Vancouver via C-Tran. It is served by all four lines of the MAX light rail system. Four Blue Line and Red Line stations (Rose Quarter Transit Center, Convention Center, Northeast 7th Ave, and Lloyd Center/Northeast 11th Ave) and one Yellow Line station (Interstate/Rose Quarter) are within the district. The Portland Streetcar system began serving the district in 2012, with the opening of a new east-side line, originally called the Central Loop; this was renamed the Loop Service in 2015.|$|R
