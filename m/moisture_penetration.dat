40|$|Four {{models are}} {{developed}} {{to assist with}} the uniform and accurate cooking of whole grains for Uncle Tobys breakfast cereals. 1. Heat satisfies a linear conduction equation and is found to rapidly penetrate the grain. 2. Moisture satisfies a non-linear diffusion equation, and is found to penetrate the grain more slowly than heat. The more sophisticated moisture diffusion model is solved by numerical and analytic techniques for spherical and ellipsoidal grains. A vital role is played in the moisture diffusion model by the concept of the mean action time for wetting a grain. These first two models are used to determine sensitivity to key cooking parameters, and to calculate the degree of over-cook in the existing batch steam process.

Given their significant interaction, interior humidity appraisals need a qualitative and/or {{quantitative assessment of}} interior moisture buffering. While the effective <b>moisture</b> <b>penetration</b> depth and effective capacitance models allow quantified assessment, their reliance on the ‘moisture penetration depth’ necessitates comprehensive material properties and hampers their application to multidimensional interior objects.
