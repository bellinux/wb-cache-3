This goes beyond the traditional preoccupation with budgets – how much have we spent so far, how <b>much</b> <b>do</b> we have left to spend? It is about helping the organization to better understand its own performance. That means making the connections and understanding the relationships between given inputs – the resources brought to bear – and the outputs and outcomes that they achieve. It is also about understanding and actively managing risks within the organization and its activities.|$|E

500|$|The {{theme of}} the episode—love songs—inspired VanDerWerff to note that such songs [...] "are great for musicals because they pretty <b>much</b> <b>do</b> all of the work {{necessary}} in terms of expressing inner emotions and moving the plot forward". He said that [...] "every song in this episode had a clear emotional and plot purpose" [...] except for the [...] "Love Shack" [...] finale.

500|$|The {{ownership}} of Chelsea by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich also caused friction between both clubs. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger said in May 2005: [...] "They are a financially doped club. They have enhancement of performances through financial resources which are unlimited. For me, it's {{a kind of}} doping because it's {{not in any way}} linked to their resources. It puts pressure on the market that is not very healthy. They can go to Steven Gerrard or Rio Ferdinand and 'say how <b>much</b> <b>do</b> you earn, we'll give you twice as much.'" [...] Wenger admitted this put Arsenal at a disadvantage in the transfer market; in the case of Shaun Wright-Phillips, a long-term target, Chelsea's interest meant Arsenal needed to wait before making a bid. The player eventually joined Chelsea from Manchester City for £21 million.|$|E

500|$|In July 2011, Lindelof {{said that}} the film would rely upon {{practical}} effects, and would use CGI generally for on-set pre-visualization of external space visuals. Scott said that [...] "you can pretty <b>much</b> <b>do</b> anything you want" [...] with digital technology, and, [...] "Doug Trumbull {{once said to me}} 'If you can do it live, do it live.' That was 29 years ago. Even though we have remarkable digital capabilities I still say do it live. It's cheaper." [...] Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski convinced Scott that {{it would be possible to}} film in 3D with the same ease and efficiency of 2D filming. 3D company 3ality Technica provided some of the rigs and equipment to facilitate 3D filming, and trained the film's crew in their proper operation. According to Scott, the decision to film in 3D added $10 million to the film's budget. Since 3D films need high lighting levels on set, the hallmark dark and shadowy atmosphere of the Alien films was added in post-production using color grading processes, and the 3D equipment was based on post-Avatar technology.|$|E
500|$|Slap-Happy was {{considered}} more varied than previous L7 albums. Although the album features several songs with aggressive guitar riffs that {{are reminiscent of}} the band's previous releases, {{as seen in the}} tracks [...] "On My Rockin' Machine", [...] "Long Green" [...] and [...] "Mantra Down", it also contains slow-paced and guitar-driven ballads like [...] "Livin' Large" [...] and [...] "Freezer Burn". The former song was described by Marc Weingarten of Rolling Stone as [...] "a kind of rallying cry for the indie-rock underclass", while the latter was seen as a melodic song that [...] "juxtaposes harsh words delivered in mellow, floating vocals." [...] Slap-Happy also contains songs that borrow elements from genres other than rock. For example, the song [...] "Little One" [...] contains elements of both polka and country music. As Sparks noted, [...] "We're all into all kinds of music, but I listen to very little rock, actually. Our approach was to pretty <b>much</b> <b>do</b> what we've always done, but we're not concerned with sticking with a particular style. There's diversity in our songwriting." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of Revolution Muslim's statement, Seattle {{cartoonist}} Molly Norris suggested that many people draw and publish pictures of Muhammad on May 20, 2010, which she dubbed the [...] "first annual Everybody Draw Mohammed Day". However, very few cartoonists actually joined her in criticizing Islam or depicting the prophet Muhammed; instead, much like Maher and Stewart, they merely praised her for her efforts and condemned the idea of censorship. Norris herself went into hiding, shortly thereafter, {{on the advice of}} the FBI. Animated comedy series Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane voiced this ambivalence {{on the part of the}} creative community, saying [...] "No one is a bigger critic of organized religion than I am", but nevertheless added, [...] "It's tricky. You pick your battles. You have to judge how real the threat is against how funny the joke is. How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> I care about the joke?" [...] And The Simpsons also addressed the apparent hypocrisy of those who claimed to stand with South Park in a chalkboard gag during the opening sequence of the April 25, 2010 episode [...] "The Squirt and the Whale", with Bart Simpson writing [...] "South Park—We'd Stand Beside You If We Weren't So Scared".|$|E
