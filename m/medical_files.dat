40|$|Results of thoughts, {{activities}} and measures taken in each organization are maintained as documents and records these records, which {{are created by}} spending great time and cost, contain valuable information and experiences that {{have an important role}} in promoting the goal or goals of the organization. therefore, <b>medical</b> records <b>filing</b> can be called memory of the organizations which weakness in it’s performance will lead to damage in all hospital activities. The present research was done to survey the <b>medical</b> records <b>filing</b> in Khorramabad teaching hospitals affiliated to Lorestan university of medical sciences in 2009. Materials and Methods: This research is a cross-sectional descriptive-analytic study. Data was collected using check-lists and questionnaires based on <b>medical</b> <b>filing</b> unit standards, and by observation and interview. Completed check-lists were analyzed using analysis limit and grading method by SPSS software. Questionnaire was utilized for qualitative evaluation of <b>medical</b> <b>filing</b> unit to analyze and clarify the <b>medical</b> <b>filing</b> situation with all the details in each hospital. Results: The desirability degree of physical location and space, staff, medical records storage and retrieval system, equipment, procedures and guidelines and mechanized system of <b>medical</b> <b>filing</b> unit in the foresaid hospitals with 41 % overall score percentage was “average”, and the highest percentage of compliance with the standard system belonged to mechanized system (48 / 8 %), while the lowest one (26 %) was related to physical location and space.

Therefore, the use of storage and retrieval modern technologies of medical record, such as establishing electronic <b>medical</b> <b>filing,</b> scanning and digital storing of medical records with fast retrieval capability cause result in Improvement in efficiency and performance of this important unit, optimum use of resources, cost saving and enhancement of patient care...|$|R

40|$|Automated {{evaluation}} of claims for medical and disability insurance benefits poses a difficult challenge {{that will take}} years to be solved. The precise wording of insurance rules and the terse language in <b>medical</b> history <b>files</b> {{make it difficult for}} humans, let alone computers, to assess insurance payment qualification accurately. In this thesis, we work towards building a tool that will aid, but not replace, human evaluators. We automate the extraction of relevant parts of medical history files; if sufficiently accurate, this would eliminate the need for human evaluators to comb through hundreds of pages of <b>medical</b> history <b>files.</b> We first create a list of medical concepts, mainly disease and procedure names, from the cardiovascular section of the "Blue Book" for Disability Evaluation under Social Security. Then, using a variation of the longest common substring algorithm, we characterize each <b>medical</b> <b>file</b> line using its substring overlaps with the list of medical concepts. Finally, with human annotations of whether each <b>medical</b> <b>file</b> line is relevant or not, we build machine learning classifiers predicting each line's relevance using its overlap characterization. The classifiers we use are Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. by Jeremy Lai. Thesis (M. Eng.)

Rebels stormed Gaddafi's personal residence, and hoisted their flag above it. Al Arabiya confirmed that the rebel flag was above the house. Reporters were shown stacks of official documents including Gaddafi's personal <b>medical</b> <b>files</b> as additional proof.

It was also confirmed that Qatari special forces participated in the assault on Gaddafi's compound.

40|$|International audienceA large {{majority}} of health care systems are still using physical patient files in order to store administrative and medical data, <b>medical</b> imaging <b>files,</b> biological analysis results, etc. Such files are required when the patient {{shows up in the}} system for any kind of medical consultation (medical consultation with a physician, long stay in the hospital, or visit in an outpatient unit). Hence patient file traceability must be managed carefully in order to avoid file loss and improve file sorting in the archive department. This paper aims at proposing a new tool for managing patient <b>medical</b> <b>file</b> traceability and improving file sorting in order to reduce delays during delivery and globally improve quality of care. This study is part of a project conducted with the Lucien Neuwirth Cancer Institute (Saint-Etienne, France). A formal modeling of <b>medical</b> <b>file</b> flows is proposed to identify risks related to lack of traceability. A discrete-event simulation model is also proposed to test various organization scenarios related to file management outside and inside the archive department of the cancer institute.
