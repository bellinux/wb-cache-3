5|$|Ireland was a net food exporter. The excess {{was shipped}} to Britain. The Irish <b>Mercantile</b> <b>Marine</b> ensured that Irish agricultural, and other, exports reached Britain, and that British coal arrived in Ireland. Some {{foods such as}} wheat, citric fruits and tea were imported. Ireland {{depended}} on, mainly, British tankers for petroleum. Initially Irish ships sailed in British convoys. In the light of experience they chose to sail alone, relying on their neutral markings. German respect for that neutrality varied from friendly to tragic.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ship was}} {{originally}} built in Belfast, Northern Ireland for the International <b>Mercantile</b> <b>Marine's</b> Dominion Line (a sister company to the White Star Line) {{and was named}} [...] SS Columbus. She was launched on 26 February 1903 and made her maiden voyage in October 1903 from Liverpool to Boston. After two voyages with the Dominion Line, the Columbus, along with three other Dominion liners; New England, Commonwealth and Mayflower were sold to the White Star Line for use on their new service between Liverpool and Boston. The Columbus was renamed Republic, the second ship under White Star livery to hold the name (White Star's original [...] of 1872 had been sold to the Holland America Line in 1889 and renamed Maasdam), while her three fellow former Dominion liners were renamed Romanic, Canopic and Cretic respectively.|$|R
5|$|After {{her return}} to International <b>Mercantile</b> <b>Marine</b> (IMM), the ship {{underwent}} a refit at the W. & A. Fletcher Marine Works yard in Hoboken that outfitted her for 242 first-, 310 second-, and 876 third-class passengers. On 8 January 1920, while Kroonland was still under repair, the American Line ship , berthed next {{to her at the}} Fletcher yard, caught fire. In the multi-alarm fire, firefighters believed that St. Louis was a lost cause, and so focused their efforts on saving Kroonland. At one point, St. Louis heeled over and leaned on Kroonland but the only resulting damages were scorch marks on her side.|$|E
5|$|Upon completion, {{the ship}} was {{chartered}} to the Dominion Line, a subsidiary line of International <b>Mercantile</b> <b>Marine</b> (IMM) with which International Navigation had merged in 1902. The liner sailed for Dominion on her maiden voyage on 8 March 1902 from Liverpool to Boston. After completing eleven voyages on that route, Merion was returned to the American Line in March 1903. The following month she began sailing on the Liverpool–Philadelphia route on which she sailed {{most of the rest}} of her passenger career. She was briefly chartered to the Red Star Line in 1907 for one Antwerp–New York voyage.|$|E
5|$|Air Commodore Hippolyte Ferdinand (Frank) De La Rue, CBE, DFC (13March 1891– 18May 1977) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).

In 1918, he was given command of No.223 Squadron in the newly formed Royal Air Force. The following year he took charge of No. 270 Squadron RAF in Egypt. Returning to Australia, De La Rue joined the short-lived Australian Air Corps in 1920, and became {{a founding member of}} the RAAF in March 1921. Specialising in maritime aviation, he led seaplane formations based at Point Cook, Victoria, during the 1920s and early 1930s.|$|E

500|$|The {{memorial}} {{is one of}} six memorials erected by the Government of Newfoundland {{following the}} First World War. Five were erected in France and Belgium and the sixth at Bowring Park in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada. The memorial is a bronze caribou, the emblem of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, standing atop a cairn of Newfoundland granite facing the former foe with head thrown high in defiance. At the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial site the mound rises approximately [...] from ground level. The mounds are also surrounded by native Newfoundland plants. At {{the base of the}} Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial mound, three bronze tablets carry the names of 820 members of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve, and the <b>Mercantile</b> <b>Marines</b> who gave their lives in the First World War and have no known grave. The memorial is situated close to the headquarters dugout of the 88th Brigade, the brigade of which the Newfoundland Regiment was a part. Sixteen memorial designs were submitted to Nangle for review. He recommended that the government accept British sculptor Basil Gotto’s plan to erect five identical caribou statues in memory of the regiment. Gotto was already well known in Newfoundland as he had been previously commissioned to execute the statue of the Fighting Newfoundlander located in Bowring Park. The landscape architect who designed the sites and supervised their construction, was Rudolph Cochius, a native of the Netherlands living in St. John's. It was decided to plant many of Newfoundland’s native tree species, such as spruce, dogberry and juniper, along the boundaries of the site. In total, over 5,000 trees were transplanted before the project was completed in 1925. The memorial was unveiled at the official opening of the site by Field Marshal Earl Haig on 7 June 1925. Those that participated or were present included Chief of the French General Staff, Marshal of France Marie Émile Fayolle, Newfoundland Colonial Secretary John Bennett, Lieutenant Generals Aylmer Hunter-Weston and Beauvoir De Lisle, Major-General D. E. Cayley and former regimental commanding officers Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Lovell and Adolph Ernest Bernard.|$|R
50|$|The company {{expanded}} in 1900 by acquiring 20 ships from the West India and Pacific Steamship Company. The firm was then reorganised as Frederick Leyland (1900), and operated {{with a capital}} of £2,800,000. In 1901 the company was bought by J. P. Morgan's International <b>Marine</b> <b>Mercantile</b> Company, but Ellerman remained as chairman, {{and the owner of}} 20 ships. He later acquired the Papayanni Steamship Company and eight of its ships. He used these assets to form the London, Liverpool and Ocean Shipping Company, based at Moorgate in London.|$|R
50|$|Students usually {{enter the}} colleges after lower {{secondary}} school(grade {{nine in the}} North American system or year ten in the British system). Therefore, students follow a 6-3-5 pattern of study (six years of elementary, three years of lower secondary and five years of college) rather than the more typical 6-3-3-4 system more commonly found in Japan. Entrance is by examination though some students may be accepted by recommendation. A few students are accepted after secondary school into the fourth year of the programme. The engineering programmes are 5 years in length while the <b>marine</b> <b>mercantile</b> programmes are 5.5 years duration. At {{the end of the}} programme, students are awarded an “Associate” credential.|$|R

50|$|Recreational {{fishing in}} Pakistan is usually {{overlooked}} by the Pakistan Game Fish Association (PGFA). There are three main types of recreational fisheries in Pakistan: billfish and tuna {{fishing in the}} EEZ of Karachi; sport fishing (pelagic) in coastal waters; and hand-line fishing (bottom fishing) in inter-tidal and shallow waters. About 1,000 people with 120-150 fishing boats {{are involved in this}} sector. No license is required. However, their boats are required to be registered by <b>Marine</b> <b>Mercantile</b> department for seaworthiness. There are three boating clubs: The Karachi Yacht Club, The Karachi Boat Club and the Defence Marina Club. A number of fishing tournaments take place annually like the All Pakistan Billfish Tournament and the TAS, Karachi. The reigning Pakistan Saltwater Angling Champion is Orooj Ahmed Ali having caught a Black Marlin weighing 396 lbs in the All Pakistan Billfish Tournament, December 5, 1999, the heaviest fish caught on rod and reel in the Arabian Sea and the record stands to date.|$|R

50|$|The {{dominant}} {{figure in}} an audacious but neglected phase of American Revolutionary history was Lambert Wickes, Esquire, of Kent County, Maryland, {{commander of the}} Continental ship Reprisal, eleventh in rank on Congress’ seniority list, and the most unassuming naval captain of his time. You will discover no evidences of pettiness and mark the absence of either jealousy or faultfinding in his character. You will appreciate his fortitude and forbearance under great trials. You will admire his tenacity of purpose and his courage. But you will deplore his outstanding characteristic, his modesty, as having been responsible for posterity’s failure to award his rightful position in American history to an officer whose achievements should be traditions in the navy, whose name should stand with John Paul Jones. It was Wickes who dared the English seas long months before Jones sailed the Ranger in European waters. It was Wickes who led the van, the first regularly commissioned naval officer to beard the British Lion in his den. A whole year before Jones received an official salute from a French squadron in Quiberon Bay, Wickes had raided shipping in the English Channel and taken a King’s packet off Falmouth. Twelve months before Jones whipped the Drake off Carrickfergus Road, Wickes had sailed around Ireland, destroyed or captured eighteen vessels, struck terror in English <b>mercantile</b> circles, sent <b>marine</b> insurance rates soaring in the United Kingdom, and won {{his way back to}} a French port after a desperate flight from a powerful British ship-of-the-line. In this one startling achievement, Wickes came so near his objective, a definite break between England and France, that the French foreign minister believed war was inevitable. The deed of Lambert Wickes guided the hand of the Comte de Vergennes in writing to the French Ambassador at London, “The flame of war is to all appearance ready to burst forth, and will probably have broken out before my letter reaches you.” That was six months before the famous treaty of Versailles between France and America. What Burgoyne’s surrender at Saratoga made possible, in February 1778, Wickes’s daring cruise around Ireland came within a hair’s breadth of effecting in August 1777. John Paul Jones based his operations upon friendly French ports with the arsenals and drydocks of the King at his command. Lambert Wickes, too, operated out of these ports, but harassed by admiralty officers zealous in enforcing orders from a neutral ministry whose drastic mandates were accompanied by clumsy efforts to give clandestine aid. A company of French marines was loaned to Jones. The Frenchmen who shipped with Wickes were thrown into prison when detected. Jones brought in his prizes for public condemnation and French jails yawned for the prisoners he had taken. Wickes’s prizes were entered by subterfuge and sold in secret at a loss and his prisoners were removed from his hands and liberated. Jones hove down in the royal dockyards with the King’s workmen to clean his ship. Wickes hove down along the shore and duped admiralty officers into permission to make repairs. Not a word of this is in disparagement of the achievements of John Paul Jones. His record is imperishable. The contrast is solely to give the proper perspective to what Wickes did. Jones had the support of a nation at war. Wickes had the tacit consent of a neutral country whose right hand oppressed and whose left hand succored. But the right hand was stronger than the left. Judged by the seemingly insurmountable obstructions placed in his path at every turn, Wickes’s success was phenomenal. Only his resourcefulness, pertinacity, and indomitable will made it possible.|$|R
