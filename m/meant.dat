5|$|Articles 125 and 123 were <b>meant</b> {{to create}} disincentives for EU {{member states to}} run {{excessive}} deficits and state debt, and prevent the moral hazard of over-spending and lending in good times. They were also <b>meant</b> to protect the taxpayers of the other more prudent member states.|$|E
5|$|Siddhaya was a {{local tax}} levied on {{agriculture}} and pottondi was a tax levied on merchandise by the local feudal ruler. Based on context, pottondi also <b>meant</b> 1/10, aydalavi <b>meant</b> 1/5 and elalavi <b>meant</b> 1/7. Mannadare literally <b>meant</b> land tax and was levied together with shepherds tax (Kurimbadere) payable to the chief of shepherds. Bhaga <b>meant</b> a portion or share of the produce from land or the land area itself. Minor taxes such as Kirudere (due to the landlords) and samathadere (raised by the army officers or samantha) are mentioned. In addition to taxes for maintenance of the local officer's retinue, villages were obligated to feed armies on the march to and from battles. Bittuvatta or niravari taxes comprised usually of {{a percentage of the}} produce and was collected for constructing irrigation tanks.|$|E
5|$|A North American {{version was}} <b>meant</b> to {{released}} for the Xbox. It was actually completed {{and was even}} reviewed by some publications, but was then canceled on March 23, 2006 for an undisclosed reason.|$|E
5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably <b>meant</b> reflections, and reflections <b>meant</b> a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|A large {{development}} Planning Association <b>meant</b> a {{great amount}} of inter-connectivity and communication requirements. A 24-hour call centre with interpreters was set up, using a Closed User Group (CUG) circuit.|$|E
5|$|After a {{few months}} she was finally {{convinced}} by her mother to resume her medication, even though this <b>meant</b> expulsion from the Sea Org. She remained {{a member of the}} church.|$|E
5|$|Although the Interface 2 proved popular, {{the high}} cost of ROM cartridges, {{and the fact that they}} were limited to 16K in size, <b>meant</b> that very few titles were {{released}} in this format.|$|E
5|$|An {{administrative}} error <b>meant</b> the club {{did not enter}} the FA Cup in 1895.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{were the}} reigning champions of England having won the Football League First Division title in 1990–91. The team had only lost one match in their {{successful}} league campaign, to Chelsea in February 1991. Arsenal's opponents Wrexham had finished {{bottom of the}} entire Football League the previous season. In normal circumstances this <b>meant</b> the club would have been relegated to the Football Conference, but the Football League's plan to expand its competition {{in time for the}} 1991–92 season <b>meant</b> there was to be no demotion.|$|E
5|$|Broadside {{armament}} {{also had}} disadvantages, which became more serious as ironclad technology developed. Heavier guns to penetrate ever-thicker armor <b>meant</b> that fewer guns could be carried. Furthermore, {{the adoption of}} ramming as an important tactic <b>meant</b> the need for ahead and all-round fire. These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all-round fire, which included central-battery, turret, and barbette designs.|$|E
5|$|Chase has {{defended his}} show, {{saying that it}} is not <b>meant</b> to {{stereotype}} all Italian Americans, only to depict a small criminal subculture.|$|E
5|$|Completion of High Speed1 has {{increased}} the potential number of trains serving London. Separation of Eurostar from British domestic services through Kent <b>meant</b> that timetabling was no longer affected by peak-hour restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Dawson {{remained}} relatively lawful, {{protected by the}} Canadian NWMP, which <b>meant</b> that gambling and prostitution were accepted while robbery and murder were kept low. By contrast, especially the port of Skagway under US jurisdiction in Southeast Alaska became infamous for its criminal underworld. The extreme climate and remoteness of the region in general <b>meant</b> that supplies and communication {{with the outside world}} including news and mail were scarce.|$|E
5|$|During the Camillan era, {{they fought}} {{in a shallow}} phalanx formation, {{supported}} by light troops. In most battles triarii were not used because the lighter troops usually defeated the enemy before the triarii were committed to the battle. They were <b>meant</b> {{to be used as}} a decisive force in the battle, thus prompting an old Roman saying: 'It comes down to the triarii' (res ad triarios venit), which <b>meant</b> carrying on to the bitter end.|$|E
5|$|East of Camerton {{the coal}} is buried beneath newer rock strata, which <b>meant</b> that mining {{in the area}} was more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, it was {{proposed}} in 1924 that Coalhouse Fort should be re-equipped with 4-inch guns but post-war defence cuts <b>meant</b> that this plan was abandoned. Instead, the fort was reduced to care and maintenance status and East Tilbury Battery was decommissioned in 1930. The continuing development of artillery firepower <b>meant</b> that the forts and batteries further downriver took on an increased responsibility for the forward defences of the Thames. The forts on Gravesend Reach were relegated to a second line of defence.|$|E
5|$|Giovinazzi's {{victories}} <b>meant</b> {{he became}} the first driver since Davide Valsecchi in 2012 to win both races in a GP2 Series race weekend. The race results <b>meant</b> Artem Markelov took over the Drivers' Championship lead with 54 points, while previous leader Norman Nato dropped to second following poor results. Giovinazzi's victory <b>meant</b> he moved to third place, one point ahead of Gasly. Russian Time remained the leaders of the Teams' Championship on 97 points, eight ahead of second-placed Prema Racing. Racing Engineering were in third position on 73 points, with seven rounds left in the season.|$|E
5|$|Gromoboi was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} repeat of , but a design modification for thicker armour and improved engines made that unfeasible. The use of Rossias hull design <b>meant</b> that the ships looked alike.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton's victory {{made him}} the fifth {{different}} driver in seven races to win a Grand Prix in 2010. The result <b>meant</b> Webber's advantage over {{second place in the}} Drivers' Championship, now occupied by Button, was extended by five points. Hamilton's victory <b>meant</b> he moved into third place, while Alonso went from third to fourth. Vettel's retirement resulted in him dropping from second to fifth. McLaren's 1–2 finish resulted in them reducing Red Bull's lead in the Constructors' Championship to one point. Ferrari's poor result <b>meant</b> they moved from second to third, with 12 races left of the season.|$|E
5|$|Ickenham {{was within}} the Uxbridge {{constituency}} until boundary changes at the 2010 general election <b>meant</b> it {{became part of the}} new Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner constituency, represented by Nick Hurd MP.|$|E
5|$|If all turrets {{were on the}} {{centreline}} of the vessel, stresses on the ship's frames {{were relatively}} low. This layout <b>meant</b> the entire main battery could fire on the broadside, though fewer could fire end-on. It <b>meant</b> the hull would be longer, which posed some challenges for the designers; a longer ship needed to devote more weight to armour to get equivalent protection, and the magazines which served each turret interfered with the distribution of boilers and engines. For these reasons, , which carried a record fourteen 12-inch guns in seven centreline turrets, was not considered a success.|$|E
5|$|In practice, Russian women saw mixed {{gains in}} their rights under Communism. Women's {{suffrage}} was granted, though voting <b>meant</b> little in Soviet society {{owing to the}} Communist Party's monopoly on power. This monopoly also <b>meant</b> that many independent feminist organizations and journals were shut down. Abortion was legalized in 1920, making the Soviet Union the first country to do so; however, it was banned again between 1936 and 1955. Generous maternity leave was legally required, and a national network of child-care centers was established. The country's first constitution recognized the equal rights of women.|$|E
5|$|In {{swimming}} {{there was}} a three-way tie in the men's 100m freestyle event, and three bronze medals were awarded; a tie for {{second place in the}} women's 100m freestyle event <b>meant</b> that no bronze was awarded. In athletics, two bronze medals were awarded in the men's high jump event. In wushu, a tie for the silver-medal position in the men's changquan event (taolu discipline) resulted in no bronze being awarded; a three-way tie in the men's nanquan event (also taolu discipline) resulted in three bronze medals being awarded. In gymnastics, many shared medals were awarded. A tie for first place in the pommel horse resulted in two gold medals, and thus no silver was awarded; a tie for third place in the horizontal bar, pommel horse, rings, women's vault and women's floor exercises <b>meant</b> that two bronzes were awarded for each event. A four-way tie for second position in the parallel bars <b>meant</b> that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Space Invaders was {{included}} in the London Science Museum's Game On exhibition <b>meant</b> to showcase the various aspects of video game history, development, and culture.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>meant</b> to {{show how}} all these {{different}} temperaments and characters – the pious Patriarch, the wily swindler, the penny-pinching merchant and so on – are ultimately derived from the same roots.|$|E
5|$|It {{may be that}} in {{the mind}} of their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex Pistols were never <b>meant</b> {{to be more than a}} nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, a touch of the old épater la bourgeoisie. It may also be that {{in the mind of}} their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols were <b>meant</b> to be a force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex Pistols were all of these things.|$|E
5|$|Letter B at the end, {{for example}} in model VK-6B, <b>meant</b> forward control cabin and L came from extra long springs.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{had won the}} 1972–73 Football League, a 2–0 {{victory over}} Leeds United ensured they became champions. Their league success <b>meant</b> that {{whatever}} the result they would be competing in the European Cup the following season. As {{a result of their}} league success, Liverpool were looking to become the first English team to win a European trophy in the same year as winning the league. Borussia Mönchengladbach had finished fifth in the 1972–73 Fußball-Bundesliga, however they won the 1972–73 DFB-Pokal, the German domestic cup competition. This <b>meant</b> they would be participating in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in the following season.|$|E
5|$|Maritime {{folklore}} {{around the}} time America was discovered held that frigatebirds were birds of good omen as their presence <b>meant</b> land was near.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{expressed}} {{hope that}} the film could be shown and released, even if it <b>meant</b> a legal battle.|$|E
5|$|Movi.Kanti.Revo: In {{association}} with Google, Cirque du Soleil released a Google Chrome extension in 2012, <b>meant</b> {{to bring some}} of Cirque du Soleil's imagination to the browser.|$|E

5|$|One {{issue that}} emerged from these studies was the problem of {{providing}} early warning to the SCD sites. The SCD's MSR radars provided detection at perhaps , which <b>meant</b> targets would appear on their radars only seconds before launches {{would have to be}} carried out. In a sneak attack scenario, there would not be enough time to receive command authority for the release of nuclear weapons. This <b>meant</b> the bases would require launch on warning authority, which was politically unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Originally <b>meant</b> to be {{released}} as 50 Cent's debut studio album: however, its release was cancelled after 50 Cent {{was involved in a}} shooting two months before the album was set to release.|$|E
5|$|Results in {{the other}} groups <b>meant</b> that a second-place finish was enough for United to {{progress}} into the quarter-finals, joining group leaders Bayern Munich.|$|E
