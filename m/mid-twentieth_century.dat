5|$|Although the {{tradition}} {{declined in the}} early to <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century,</b> in part due to opposition from some local Christian clergy and changing social conditions, it was revived in new forms in the mid-to-latter part of the century. The tradition has also inspired various artistic depictions, appearing, for instance, {{in the work of the}} painter Clive Hicks-Jenkins and the poet Vernon Watkins.|$|E

5|$|From their {{discovery}} by numismatists, 1804 dollars have commanded high prices. Auction prices reached $1,000 by 1885, {{and in the}} <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century,</b> {{the coins}} realized over $30,000. In 1999, a Class I example sold for $4.14 million, then the highest price paid for any coin. Their high value has caused 1804 dollars to be a frequent target of counterfeiting and other methods of deception.|$|E
5|$|Gregory {{lacked the}} {{administrative}} ability {{of his brother}} Basil or the contemporary influence of Gregory of Nazianzus, but he was an erudite theologian who {{made significant contributions to}} the doctrine of the Trinity and the Nicene Creed. Gregory's philosophical writings were influenced by Origen. Since the <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century,</b> there has been a significant increase in interest in Gregory's works from the academic community, particularly involving universal salvation, which has resulted in challenges to many traditional interpretations of his theology.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} social {{scientific}} methods has also expanded. Social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The linguistic and cultural turns of the <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century</b> led to increasingly interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophic approaches towards the analysis of society. Conversely, {{the end of the}} 1990s and the beginning of 2000s have seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically and computationally rigorous techniques, such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis.|$|E

40|$|Using {{selective}} maize {{yield data}} from ethnohistoric and government sources dating between the mid-nineteenth and <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>centuries,</b> Schroeder (1999) argues that Mississippian average yield potential fell within a 9 [...] 10 bu/acre range. We evaluate her argument {{in terms of}} well-established climatic, environmental, varietal, and behavioral constraints on maize agriculture and conclude that reconstructing prehistoric agricultural potential requires a more precise methodology that incorporates these factors...|$|R
5|$|By 1964 over 20,000 {{new homes}} had been built, {{transforming}} the dense overcrowded and unsanitary slums of the pre-war city into a low density, dispersed suburbia. Most {{of the city}} centre shops had been destroyed and those that remained were cleared to enable a zoned reconstruction according to his plan. In 1962 the modernist high rise of the Civic Centre was constructed, an architecturally significant example of <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century</b> civic slab-and-tower set piece. The Plymouth City Council allowed it to fall into disrepair but it was grade II listed in 2010 by English Heritage to prevent its demolition.|$|E
5|$|A modernist painter, Bellette was {{influential}} in <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century</b> Sydney art circles. She frequently painted scenes {{influenced by the}} Greek tragedies of Euripides and Sophocles and the epics of Homer. The only woman to have won the Sulman Prize more than once, Bellette claimed the accolade in 1942 with For Whom the Bell Tolls, and in 1944 with Iphigenia in Tauris. She helped found the Blake Prize for Religious Art, and was its inaugural judge. Bellette married artist and critic Paul Haefliger in 1935. The couple moved to Majorca in 1957; although she visited and exhibited in Australia thereafter, she did not return there to live, and became peripheral to the Australian art scene.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{relatively}} mild temperate climate with ample precipitation, the areas around Image Lake boast rich natural habitats with many species of plants, insects, rodents, and large mammals. Native Americans took advantage of these resources, and may have inhabited the area seasonally. However, human activity such as hunting, fishing, and mining, and recreational overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans. As a result, some areas experienced significant environmental degradation {{near the end of the}} nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, including the eradication of large predatory animals. Recreational overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic in the early to <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, one species of the wildebeest, Connochaetes albojubatus, was {{identified}} in eastern Africa. In 1914, two separate races of the wildebeest were introduced, namely Gorgon a. albojubatus ("Athi white-bearded wildebeest") and G. a. mearnsi ("Loita white-bearded wildebeest"). However, in 1939, the two were once again merged into a single race, Connochaetes taurinus albojubatus. In the <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century,</b> two separate forms were recognised, Gorgon taurinus hecki and G. t. albojubatus. Finally two distinct types of wildebeest – the blue and black wildebeest – were identified. The blue wildebeest was at first placed under a separate genus, Gorgon, while the black wildebeest belonged to the genus Connochaetes. Today they are united in the single genus Connochaetes: the black wildebeest being named (C. gnou) and the blue wildebeest, (C. taurinus).|$|E
5|$|In the <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century,</b> {{there were}} {{divisions}} in the Melbourne art scene, which became intertwined with the complex cultural politics of the Cold War era. In the late 1940s, there was a move against modernism in art, and tonalism came into favour. Partly {{as a reaction to}} this development, artist George Bell established an exhibiting group called the Melbourne Contemporary Artists in 1940. Bell was a former war artist and influential member of the Victorian artistic establishment, who after World War II was appointed to teach at the National Gallery of Victoria's painting school. Influenced by Bell, Stokes was among the artists for whom modernism was a strong influence, and who exhibited with the Melbourne Contemporary Artists. Other members of the group included Russell Drysdale and Sali Herman.|$|E
5|$|Lassie themes {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} boys and their dogs with the show helping to shape the viewer's understanding of <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century</b> American boyhood. Lassie {{was associated with the}} wholesome family values of its period but some parents' groups monitoring television content found cliffhanger plots showing children in danger too intense for very young viewers and objected to some of Timmy's actions which were believed to encourage children to disobey parents. However, Lassie was consistently depicted as caring, nurturing, and responsible with a commitment to family and community, often rescuing those in peril and righting wrongs. She was the perfect 'mother' within the American ideology of the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

50|$|The Maple Park Historic District in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin {{reflects}} {{the area that}} was part of the original plat of the settlement in 1837.

The earliest houses in the district reflect the Greek Revival and Italianate styles and were home to some of the town's earliest settlers. Following the Civil War, Lake Geneva became known as a retreat for wealthy citizens from Chicago, Illinois. During this period, stately houses were built in the Maple Park neighborhood.|$|R
5|$|Scientists {{initially}} {{hypothesized that}} acne represented {{a disease of}} the skin's hair follicle, and occurred due to blockage of the pore by sebum. During the 1880s, bacteria were observed by microscopy in skin samples affected by acne and were regarded as the causal agents of comedones, sebum production, and ultimately acne. During the <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century,</b> dermatologists realized that no single hypothesized factor (sebum, bacteria, or excess keratin) could completely explain the disease. This led to the current understanding that acne {{could be explained by}} a sequence of related events, beginning with blockage of the skin follicle by excessive dead skin cells, followed by bacterial invasion of the hair follicle pore, changes in sebum production, and inflammation.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} textual {{reference to}} the hoodening tradition comes from {{the first half of}} the eighteenth century. A number of scattered references to it appeared over the next century and a half, many of which considered it to be a declining tradition that had become extinct in many parts of Kent. Aware of this decline, in the early twentieth century the folklorist and historian Percy Maylam documented what survived of the tradition and traced its appearances in historical documents, publishing his findings as The Hooden Horse in 1909. Although deemed extinct at the time of the First World War, the custom was revived in an altered form during the <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century,</b> when the use of the hooden horse was incorporated into a number of modern Kentish folk traditions.|$|E
5|$|Two {{forms of}} juldarigi, from Gijisi (Dangjin) and Yeongsang, are {{recognised}} as Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea. The Yeongsan ceremony is held {{later in the}} year than elsewhere, having been moved from the lunar festival to March 1 in the <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century</b> (to commemorate the March 1st Movement). In 2009, a special ₩20000 coin was minted in South Korea commemorating the Yeongsan juldarigi. In Gijisi, where the sport has been practiced for at least 500 years, the traditional East/West divide is replaced with a division of teams into upriver and downriver. The centipede-like shape of the rope is said to resemble {{the way in which the}} villages of the region are arranged. Gijisi is also home to a museum devoted to the practice of juldarigi.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{conditions}} that promoted mobilization against established authority. The analysis of rural mobilization distinguishes from among longitudinal and immediate conditions, the mobilization process itself {{and the role of}} the state. The concept of articulation of modes of production examines the processes of rural transformation by following the changing nature of land ownership and patron-client relations. The evolving patterns of class opposition and alliance reflected directly the state of articulation of capitalist and pre-capitalist modes of production and the process of class formation in the southern Peruvian highlands over the course of the late eighteenth to the <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>centuries...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{other ethnic}} groups are the Mandingo (also known as Mandinka).

They predominate in the large towns, most notably Karina, in Bombali District in the north; Kabala and Falaba in Koinadugu District in the north; and Yengema, Kono District in the east of the country. Like the Fula, the Mandinka are virtually all Muslims. Sierra Leone's third president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, and Sierra Leone's first Vice-President Sorie Ibrahim Koroma were both ethnic Mandingo.|$|R
50|$|While {{their attempt}} to clear the title was {{ultimately}} dismissed, the RLDS Church began maintaining the temple {{on the basis of}} the court's opinion that it was the lawful successor of the original church. Although the 1880 case had no legal bearing, the church secured clear title to the temple through adverse possession by 1901. In dire need of repair from the late-nineteenth to <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>centuries,</b> without a restoration of the building as undertaken by RLDS Church caretakers it is unlikely the building would be standing today. The RLDS Church, which was renamed Community of Christ in 2001, remains the owner of the Kirtland Temple.|$|R
5|$|Gregory's work {{received}} little scholarly {{attention in the}} West until the <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century,</b> and he was historically treated as a minor figure in comparison to Basil the Great or Gregory of Nazianzus. As late as 1942, Hans Urs von Balthasar wrote that his work was virtually unknown. In {{part due to the}} scholarship of Balthasar and Jean Daniélou, by the 1950s Gregory became the subject of much serious theological research, with a critical edition of his work published (Gregorii Nysseni Opera), and the founding of the International Colloquium on Gregory of Nyssa. This attention has continued to the present day. Modern studies have mainly focused on Gregory's eschatology rather than his more dogmatic writings, and he has gained a reputation as an unconventional thinker whose thought arguably prefigures postmodernism. Major figures in contemporary research include Sarah Coakley, John Zizioulas and Robert Jenson.|$|E
5|$|In North America, the {{original}} Jefferson flock of Shetlands did not persist. Other importations {{were made at}} the beginning of the twentieth century most notably to Mrs. W.W. Burch of Coopersville, MI (wife of the Editor of the American Sheep Breeder at the time), and Mr. L.V. Harkness of the Walnut Hall (the same of Standardbred Horse fame). There is record of these flocks surviving until 1916, and also record of another flock in Illinois in 1917. By 1921, it was recorded that Shetlands could not be bought in the U.S. (The Sheep Breeder, 1921). It was not until the <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century</b> that Shetlands were imported into Canada, and then from Canada into the United States in the 1980s. Since then, a North American Shetland Sheep Registry has been established, and there are now thousands of the breed in the region.|$|E
5|$|The Philaletheis Society (often {{shortened}} to Philaletheis or just Phil {{and founded}} as The Philalethean Society) {{is a student}} theatre group at Vassar College {{in the town of}} Poughkeepsie, New York, and the school's oldest student organization. Founded in December 1865, Phil began as a college literary society and its first leader was college president John Howard Raymond. Control of the organization was swiftly handed to the students and the group split into three chapters, each with a distinct focus. The group maintained its literary focus until the 1890s, by which point dramatic productions had taken over in popularity. The tradition of producing four and later three plays per year continued into the <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>century,</b> but in 1958, the organization disbanded due to lack of interest. It was revived in 1975, first as an arm of student government and then as an independent student organization.|$|E
50|$|Only a {{small portion}} of Central Wharf exists today, with the {{majority}} of the site having been demolished in stages {{over the course of the}} late nineteenth and <b>mid-twentieth</b> <b>centuries.</b> The length of the pier was considerably reduced in ca. 1868 due to land reclamation undertaken for the construction of Atlantic Avenue, which ran through the middle of the wharf, and most of the warehouses were torn down in the 1950s-1970s to make way for several projects, including the building of the Central Artery and the New England Aquarium. The aquarium has since become a major feature on the remaining area of the wharf, having operated there since its opening in 1969.|$|R
