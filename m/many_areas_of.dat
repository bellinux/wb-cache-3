5|$|The Eye of Ra was {{involved}} in <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> ancient Egyptian religion, including in the cults of the many goddesses who are equated with it.

5|$|Although {{women in}} industrialised {{countries}} have narrowed {{the gender gap}} in life expectancy and now live longer than men, in <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes. Gender remains an important social determinant of health, since women's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, and family responsibilities. Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including health care, and the greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater adverse impact on health.|$|E

5|$|Danny {{is notable}} for its extreme rainfall, the tornadoes {{generated}} by it, {{and the destruction}} it produced on its path, causing a total of nine fatalities and $ (1997USD, $ USD) in damage. The storm dropped a record amount of rainfall for Alabama, as at least 36.71inches (932mm) fell on Dauphin Island. Flooding, power outages, and erosion occurred in <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the Gulf Coast, and rescues had to be executed from flooded roadways. Tornadoes generated by Danny on the East Coast caused {{a great amount of}} damage. Of the nine fatalities caused by Danny, one happened off the coast of Alabama, four occurred in Georgia, two occurred in South Carolina, and two occurred in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> {{mathematics}} and its inverse function {{is often referred}} to as the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential. Another example is the p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{immigration}} {{is also a}} factor in the state's population growth, causing the state's population to continue to grow as of the 2010 Census (particularly in Massachusetts gateway cities where costs of living are lower). 40% of foreign immigrants were from Central or South America, according to a 2005 Census Bureau study, with many of the remainder from Asia. Many residents who have settled in Greater Springfield claim Puerto Rican descent. <b>Many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> Massachusetts showed relatively stable population trends between 2000 and 2010. Exurban Boston and coastal areas grew the most rapidly, while Berkshire County in far Western Massachusetts and Barnstable County on Cape Cod were the only counties to lose population as of the 2010 Census.|$|E

5|$|Groundwater {{levels have}} been dropping, to varying degrees, in <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the city, {{due in part}} to an {{increase}} in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground. A city agency, the Boston Groundwater Trust, coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells. However, Boston's drinking water supply, from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs to the west, is {{one of the very few}} in the country so pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS is {{diagnosed}} via laboratory testing and then staged {{based on the}} presence of certain signs or symptoms. HIV screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force for all people 15years to 65years of age including all pregnant women. Additionally, testing is recommended for those at high risk, which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness. In <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the world, a third of HIV carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of the disease when AIDS or severe immunodeficiency has become apparent.|$|E
5|$|James Robert Cade (September 26, 1927 – November 27, 2007) was an American physician, {{university}} professor, {{research scientist}} and inventor.

Although Cade engaged in <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> medical research, he is most widely remembered {{as the leader of the}} research team that created the sports drink Gatorade.
