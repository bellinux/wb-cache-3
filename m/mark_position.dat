30|$|The {{improvement}} of EgoSimilar+ {{through the use}} of the two new ideas (adding biases, finding and promoting non-dominated potential friends) is very substantial, leading it to place existing friends on average at around the 29 % <b>mark</b> (<b>position</b> 83 / 285). This improves our confidence on the quality of friend recommendations that EgoSimilar can make. EgoSimilar+ also clearly excels against all other similarity computation methods for weights (w 1,w 2)[*]=[*](0.5, 0.5) and (w 1,w 2)[*]=[*](0.75, 0.25), however its improvement over EgoSimilar is not as large since the critical factor in its improvement is the addition of biases to compute unknown ratings for items, and in the above cases item similarity has a smaller weight than in the (w 1,w 2)[*]=[*](0.25, 0.75) case.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a new method of position detection for a mesh-backed printing screen with an alignment mark that is overlapped by mesh patterns. A circular hole is selected as an alignment mark {{so that at}} least a portion of its contour can be observed {{through the windows of}} the mesh wires. To recognize the true contour, the smallest circle enclosing binary patterns acquired with a transmitted illumination is detected. Then the <b>mark</b> <b>position</b> is calculated by approximating the recognized contour to a circle with the least square fitting. To speed up the procedure, a convex hull and the farthest-point Voronoi diagram is generated before the smallest enclosing circle detection.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} a Polarized Optical Orthogonal Code (Polarized-OOC) is {{proposed}} by exploiting the polarization {{property of the}} fiber and the chip’s polarization state. The polarized-OOC code is generated using the concept of <b>Mark</b> <b>Position</b> Difference (MPD) set. Polarized-OOC code cardinality is shown to be two {{times that of the}} conventional OOC which reflects {{an increase in the number}} of supported users. Furthermore, since the correlation properties of the constructed code are the same as that of conventional OOC, error rate performance is evaluated in the same way as in conventional OOC. Also, a simple procedure for fiber-induced polarization rotation compensation is introduced. We then use simulations to show that relative polarization axis misalignment between the desired user and interfering users leads to violation of the correlation properties of the proposed code. 126 Tarhuni, Elmusrati, and Korhonen 1...|$|E

Reverse-perspective stimuli were used to elicit a depth-inversion illusion, in which far points on the stimulus appear to be closer than near points and vice versa, with a 2 (Type of stimulus) [*]×[*] 2 (Fixation <b>mark</b> <b>position)</b> design. To study perspective, two types of stimuli were used: a version with painted linear perspective cues and a version with blank (unpainted) surfaces. To examine the role of convexity, two locations {{were used for the}} fixation mark: either in a locally convex or a locally concave part of each stimulus (painted and unpainted versions). Results indicated that the reverse-perspective illusion was stronger when the stimulus contained strong perspective cues and when observers fixated a locally concave region within the scene...|$|E

Therefore a review conceptual study has been carried out on the various surgical concepts of Sushruta Samhita.

40|$|Computer disk is unreadable. An {{automated}} camera {{calibration procedure}} was successfully developed to allow accurate measurements {{to be made}} from images obtained from camera-lens systems exhibiting geometric and lens distortion. The calibration procedure is based upon image analysis methods programmed in script using Mathworks MATLAB software. The process initially involved capturing an 512 x 512 pixel image of a calibration chart consisting of a regularly spaced two dimensional grid of circle shaped fiducial marks. Background leveling was used to correct intensity gradients due to non uniform illumination. A region of interest was determined for each fiducial mark in the image, by thresholding followed by an identification process. A grayscale Centroid Calculation Method was then used to accurately determine the center position of each fiducial mark. Two polynomial equations were fitted in the least squares sense to describe an inverse spatial transformation function that mapped fiducial <b>mark</b> <b>position</b> (xT,yT) in the image to the actual positions (x,y) in real world coordinates on the calibration chart. A second image of a calibration chart was obtained so that the overall calibration error could be assessed for the procedure. The effect of altering the degree of the fitted polynomial equation on the error was investigated. No significant reduction in error was achieved by increasing the order of the fitted polynomial equations above order 4. The effect of altering fiducial mark size on error was investigated. For the Fujinon TV lens being tested at a focal distance of 32 cm and a field size of approximately 18 cm square, an optimal fiducial mark diameter was determined to be 3 mm (8. 5 pixels). Increased calibration error was obtained for fiducial mark diameters both greater and less than this figure. The effects on calibration error of varying aperture were investigated. Greater calibration error observed at low aperture settings was attributed to primary lens aberration and also the possibility of systematic error in the Centroid Calculation Method due to spatial undersampling in the image. Increased diffraction resulting in loss of definition at the reduced aperture probably explains the increase in error that was observed at aperture setting, f 22. An optimum aperture setting of f 11 was determined, for this particular lens. The use of this camera calibration procedure has resulted in a large increase in accuracy for position determination or measurement from an image. When the non-linear effects of geometric or lens distortion are ignored, the maximum observed error was seen to be as high as 5. 10 pixels compared to the maximum error in a 4 th order calibrated image of 0. 77 pixels. Mean error was observed to decrease from 1. 25 to 0. 33 pixels in the calibrated case. The mean error obtained {{as a result of the}} calibration closely approached the estimated uncertainty present in the physical calibration chart. The computation time required for the calibration of an image of a control chart having 320 control points, including the calculation of a verification image, was found to be 6. 5 minutes on a Pentium 100 MHz computer. The advantage of the automated procedure is that it is accurate and fast, unlike manual methods that are tedious, time consuming and prone to error...|$|E
