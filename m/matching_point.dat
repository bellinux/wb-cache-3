30|$|Surface fitting is {{a method}} with high accuracy, low computation, and strong {{anti-noise}} performance, which has been widely used in various scenarios. Such as rock deformation measurement, electronic deformation measurement, and palmprint image correlation matching-based repeat location technology. The premise that the sub-pixel displacement can be successfully calculated by surface fitting method is that the whole pixel <b>matching</b> <b>point</b> of the template can be correctly searched in the whole pixel search stage, and once there is an error in the whole pixel <b>matching</b> <b>point</b> search, then the displacement distance from the sub-pixel measurement phase will be meaningless. Using different fitting functions to fit the correlation coefficient matrix will have a certain influence on the results. The commonly used fitting functions include quadratic function, cubic function, and Gao Si function. In this paper, Gao Si function is used for surface fitting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Registration of {{multi-modal}} retinal {{images is}} very significant to inte-grate information gained from different modalities for a reliable diagnosis of retinal diseases by ophthalmologists. However, accurate image registration is a challenging, we propose an algorithm for registration of summed-voxel projec-tion images (SVPIs) with color fundus photographs (CFPs) based on local patch matching. SVPIs are evenly split into 16 local image blocks for extracting <b>matching</b> <b>point</b> pairs by searching local maximization of the similarity function. These <b>matching</b> <b>point</b> pairs {{are used for}} a coarse registration and then a search region of feature matching points is redefined for a more accurate registration. The performance of our registration algorithm is tested {{on a series of}} datasets including 3 normal eyes and 20 eyes with age-related macular degeneration.

If the signal is controlled by software, the deviation of the signal on the y-axis will be excluded. In this way, the image migration feature retrieval is only calculated in the x direction, and the template also slides on a line, which will save a lot of time relatively, or the image migration feature retrieval steps can be followed to match frame by frame, and the result will be more accurate.|$|E
