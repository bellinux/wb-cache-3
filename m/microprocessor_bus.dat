40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we propose}} to reduce {{execution}} {{time and to}} gain predictability by making use of a concurrent hardware soft-ware scheme for memory hierarchies. Making use of memory hier-archies will allow reducing memory access time while concurrency will relax memory bandwidth resource constraint. The software part of the scheme makes a static analysis of the red time application and generates a 6 le containing special controller instructions. These instructions are generated and scheduled using artificial intelligence optimization techniques so to assure an optimal concurrent manage-ment scheme of the memory hierarchy. The hardware part is com-posed by specially designed memory Controllers which are connected to a dedicated bus which allows {{access to all the}} memory hierarchy levels.

40|$|The SoC design faces a {{gap between}} the {{production}} capabilities and time to market pressures. The design space, grows with the improvements in the production capabilities in terms of amount of time to design a system that utilizes those capabilities. On the other hand shorter product life cycles are forcing an aggressive reduction of the time-to-market. Fast simulation capabilities are required for coping with the immense design space that is to be explored; these are especially needed during early stages of the design. This need has pushed the development of transaction level models, which are abstract models that execute dramatically faster than synthesizable models.

It is especially problematic in modern computer mem-ory buses and high speed telecommunication devices, such as switches and routers operating at 10 Gb/s on its ports. It is believed that circuit board buses can be used up to about 20 GHz, {{but there is a}} problem with Intersymbol Inter-ference (ISI) causing distortion of transmitted symbols by multiple reflections. Actually, the circuit board bus behaves like a passive low pass filter with unknown (perhaps changing) transfer characteristic. The problem of ISI was solved some time ago in the telecommunication area. With use of adaptive equalizers it is possible to increase throughput of a long distance communication channel dramatically. But the <b>microprocessor</b> <b>bus</b> has certain differences from telecommunica-tion devices such as modems. First of all, the clock frequency on a bus is much higher than in modems. Secondly, a bus has a much more complex structure than a telecommunication channel. At the same time, we can’t use a lot of re-sources for bus maintaining.

The custom peripherals can be of literally any nature from I/O interfaces to Ethernet Media Access Controllers. The latter core, however, usually consumes {{a big part of}} a good sized FPGA. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the possibilities of interfacing an FPGA based Microblaze system to an off-chip Ethernet MAC/PHY. A solution which would consume a smaller part of the targeted FPGA, and thus giving room for other on-chip peripherals or enable the use of a smaller sized FPGA. To employ a smaller FPGA is desirable since it would reduce power consumption and device price. This work includes evaluation of different available Ethernet devices, decision of interface technology, implementation of the interface, testing and verification. Since the ISA interface still is a common interface to Ethernet MAC devices a bus bridge is implemented linking the internal On-Chip Peripheral Bus (OPB) with the ISA bus. Due to delivery delays of the selected Ethernet chip a small on-chip ISA peripheral was constructed to provide a tool for the testing and verification of the bus bridge.

40|$|It {{is likely}} that the demand for {{multiprocessor}} system-on-chip (MPSoC) with low power consumption and high reliability in the presence of soft errors will continue to increase. However, low power and reliable MPSoC design is challenging due to conflicting trade-off between power minimisation and reliability objectives. This thesis is concerned with the development and validation of techniques to facilitate effective design of low power and reliable MPSoCs. Special emphasis is placed upon system-level design techniques for MPSoCs with voltage scaling enabled processors highlighting the trade-offs between performance, power consumption and reliability. An important aspect in the system-level design is to validate reliability in the presence of soft errors through simulation technique. The first part of the thesis addresses the development of a SystemC fault injection simulator based on a novel fault injection technique. Using MPEG- 2 decoder and other examples, it is shown that the simulator benefits from minimum design intrusion and high fault representation. The simulator is used throughout the thesis to facilitate the study of reliability of MPSoC. On-chip communication architecture plays a vital role in determining the performance and reliability of MPSoCs. The second part of the thesis focuses on comparative study between two types of on-chip communication architectures: network-on-chip (NoC) and advanced <b>microprocessor</b> <b>bus</b> architecture (AMBA). The comparisons are carried out using real application traffic based on MPEG- 2 video decoder demonstrating the trade-off between performance and reliability. The third part of the thesis concentrates on low power and reliable system-level design techniques. Two new techniques are presented, which are capable of generating optimised designs in terms of low power consumption and reliability. The first technique demonstrates a power minimisation technique through appropriate voltage scaling of the MPSoC cores, such that real-time constraints are met and reliability is maintained at acceptable-level. The second technique deals with joint optimisation of power minimisation and reliability improvement for time-constrained MPSoCs. Extensive experiments are conducted for these two new techniques using different applications, including MPEG- 2 video decoder. It is shown that the proposed techniques give significant power reduction and reliability improvement compared to existing techniques. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

We performed detailed characterization of the power dissipation patterns {{of a variety of}} system components and used these results to build detailed power models, including a highly accurate, validated instruction-level power model of the XScale processor. We also proposed a scalable, efficient and validated methodology for incorporating fast, accurate power modeling capabilities into system description languages such as SystemC. This was validated against physical measurements of hardware power dissipation. • Modeling the behavior of non-digital SoC components within standard System Design Languages. We presented an approach for modeling the functionality, performance, power, and thermal behavior of a complex class of non-digital components — MEMS microhotplate-based gas sensors — within a SystemC design framework. The components modeled include both digital components (such as <b>microprocessors,</b> <b>busses</b> and memory) and MEMS devices comprising a gas sensor SoC. The first SystemC models of a MEMS-based SoC and the first SystemC models of MEMS thermal behavior were described. Techniques for significantly improving simulation speed were proposed, and their impact quantified. • Vertically Integrated Execution-Driven Power, Performance and Thermal Co-Simulation For SoCs. We adapted the above techniques and used numerical methods to model the system of differential equations that governs on-chip thermal diffusion. This allows a single high-speed simulation to span performance, power and thermal modeling of a design. It also allows feedback behaviors, such as the impact of temperature on power dissipation or performance, to be modeled seamlessly. We validated the thermal equation-solving engine on test layouts against detailed low-level tools, and illustrated the power of such a strategy by demonstrating a series of studies that designers can perform using such tools.

Among them, the lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery is widely-adopted because of its high energy density on both a gravimetric and volumetric basis. To achieve longer system run-time and smaller size, more and more system designers are focusing on improving a system’s power conversion efficiency with advanced circuit topologies through {{a better understanding of the}} battery characteristics. This paper first reviews the typical Li-Ion battery discharge characteristics and then discusses five commonly used DC-DC converters in portable power devices. Light load efficiency improvement, output voltage regulation accuracy, battery impedance impact on the system efficiency and system stability are also analyzed in detail. I...|$|R
50|$|The Runway bus is a {{front side}} bus {{developed}} by Hewlett-Packard {{for use by}} its PA-RISC microprocessor family. The Runway bus is a 64-bit wide, split transaction, time multiplexed address and data bus running at 120 MHz. This scheme was chosen by HP as they determined that a bus using separate address and data wires would have only delivered 20% more bandwidth for a 50% increase in pin count, which would have made <b>microprocessors</b> using the <b>bus</b> more expensive. The Runway bus was introduced {{with the release of}} the PA-7200 and was subsequently used by the PA-8000, PA-8200, PA-8500, PA-8600 and PA-8700 microprocessors. Early implementations of the bus used in the PA-7200, PA-8000 and PA-8200 had a theoretical bandwidth of 960 MB/s. Beginning with the PA-8500, the Runway bus was revised to transmit on both rising and falling edges of a 125 MHz clock signal, which increased its theoretical bandwidth to 2 GB/s. The Runway bus was succeeded with the introduction of the PA-8800, which used the Itanium 2 bus.|$|R
