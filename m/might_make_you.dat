2500|$|Copland's {{willingness}} to foster talent extended to critiquing scores in progress that {{were presented to}} him by his peers. Composer William Schuman writes, [...] "As a teacher, Aaron was extraordinary.... Copland would look at your music and try to understand what you were after [...] He didn't want to turn you into another Aaron Copland.... When he questioned something, it was in a manner that <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> want to question it yourself. Everything he said was helpful in making a younger composer realize the potential of a particular work. On the other hand, Aaron could be strongly critical." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a mixed review, Sean Fennessey of Spin {{felt that}} the album does not suit Rihanna's ballad-based {{strengths}} and found her voice too flat and unexpressive to convey the anger of the songs. Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal similarly said that her [...] "artistic aspirations are currently loftier than her abilities". Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club viewed the music as bloated and compared its lyrics negatively to [...] "excerpts from a therapy session". Alexis Petridis, writing in The Guardian, criticized its allusions to Chris Brown's assault of her {{and said that the}} album does not offer anything beyond [...] "the public's prurient interest in her private life." [...] Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice found the subtext uncomfortable and commented that the album's highlights, [...] "thrilling as they are, <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel even worse" [...] than the low points.|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} performance, PC Magazine {{described}} the Priv as having [...] " [...] like [...] that's been throttled down after some gaming", noting that its AnTuTu scores {{were lower than}} those of the Nexus 6P and Samsung Galaxy S6. It also noted that while it wasn't [...] "technically" [...] unresponsive, [...] "there are some complex animations and missed touch or typing inputs that <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel like it is". The Wall Street Journal felt that the Priv felt [...] "inexcusably slow" [...] at times, reporting instances of slow or unresponsive apps. The battery life was praised, with The Wall Street Journal remarking that it [...] "outran" [...] the Nexus 5X, 6P and iPhone 6S, while PC Magazine credited its aggressive suppression of background activity as improving its standby battery life, stating that it survived a weekend of use with 25% capacity still remaining. In contrast, The Verge and Ars Technica claimed they were unable to reach the device's advertised battery life. PC Magazine praised the Priv's call quality, noting that it had a clear microphone and [...] "delivers very loud maximum speakerphone and earpiece volume with zero distortion or wobble." [...] The Priv's rear-facing camera was criticized for having autofocus issues and for producing washed-out images with poor contrast and low-light performance.|$|E

My time was so occupied, verily I {{did not seem to}} have a moment. The fact is, these sorenesses are due to a strange, new {{religion}} to which I and my subjects have but recently become converted. And O that I <b>might</b> <b>make</b> <b>thee</b> also of the true faith! 'Tis a wondrous tale, my lord. Some two moons back there was brought to my Court by wandering pirates a captive of an uncouth race who dwell in the north. And this man has taught us----" ...|$|R

'Besides, O my Mansoul, thou seest what I have done, and how I {{have taken}} thee {{out of the}} hands of thine enemies: unto whom thou hadst deeply revolted from my Father, and by whom thou wast content to be possessed, and also to be destroyed. I came to thee first by my law, then by my gospel, to awaken thee, and show thee my glory.

The music video received three million hits on YouTube within a month of its posting.
