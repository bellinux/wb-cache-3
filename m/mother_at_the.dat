While Odd is at a restaurant, police come in and arrest the cook. At the shop where he normally buys his pipe tobacco, he learns that the owner has died. He decides to sell his boat, leading to misadventures when the buyer, who works at an airport, asks Odd to meet him there inside the secure zone. Odd goes to the local swimming pool, but his shoes were removed when the facility closed; as he is leaving, he finds a pair of red high-heeled boots and walks away in them.|$|E
5|$|At State {{funerals}} the heralds {{once again}} {{take their place}} {{at the front of}} the royal procession as it enters the place of worship. Historically during the procession of royal funerals (usually of the Sovereign) the heralds would carry a piece of armour, representing the various marks of chivalry. These included the helm and crest, spurs, gauntlet, target (shield of arms), sword and a literal 'coat of arms' (a heraldic surcoat). This procession of chivalry was an integral part of the heraldic royal funeral. One of the most solemn role for the heralds during a royal funeral is the reading of the full list of the styles and titles of the deceased. On 9 April 2002, Garter King of Arms Peter Gwynn-Jones read out the full styles and 437 titles of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen <b>Mother</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of her funeral service at Westminster Abbey.|$|E

5|$|I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a 1969 {{autobiography}} {{about the}} early years of American writer and poet Maya Angelou. The first in a seven-volume series, it is a coming-of-age story that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome racism and trauma. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a <b>mother</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 16. In the course of Caged Bird, Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an inferiority complex into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice.|$|E

5|$|Louis {{was born}} as Ludwig Alexander von Battenberg in Graz, Styria, {{the eldest son}} of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine by his morganatic {{marriage}} to Countess Julia von Hauke. Because of his morganatic parentage, Louis was denied his father's rank in the Grand Duchy of Hesse; and, from birth, his style of Illustrious Highness and title of Count of Battenberg instead derived from the rank given to his <b>mother</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of her marriage. On 26 December 1858, he automatically became His Serene Highness Prince Louis of Battenberg when his mother was elevated to Princess of Battenberg with the style of Serene Highness, by decree of her husband's brother, Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse.|$|E

5|$|Many {{designers}} {{were involved}} in the construction of memorials, but some became particularly well known for their work in this area. Many of the sculptors active on the memorials were established, Victorian-era individuals; the war had disrupted the training of a new generation, and many young sculptors had been killed. Some attempts were made to give preference to designers who had fought in the war, but this was far from universal. In British circles, Edwin Lutyens, Herbert Baker, Reginald Blomfield and Charles Holden formed the core of the established artists; these were joined by Charles Sargeant Jagger, Gilbert Ledward and Eric Gill from the younger generation. Pietro Porcelli was a particularly prolific Australian designer.

5|$|The Crown Jewels {{include two}} sceptres {{originally}} made for Mary of Modena, {{the wife of}} JamesII, in 1685: a gold sceptre with a cross known as the Queen Consort's Sceptre with Cross and another topped by a dove known as the Queen Consort's Ivory Rod with Dove, which, as the name suggests, is made of ivory. Unlike the sovereign's dove, this one has folded wings and is relatively small. It was last used by Queen Elizabeth, later known as the Queen <b>Mother,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> coronation of her husband GeorgeVI in 1937. For the coronation of MaryII, the wife and joint sovereign of WilliamIII, a more elaborate gold sceptre with dove was commissioned in 1689. It has not been used since, and went missing for several decades, only {{to be found in}} 1814 at the back of a cupboard in the Tower of London.|$|E

On 5August, 800 more children arrived from the concentration camp at Mlaka. The last group arrived from the nearby village of Gornja Reka on 14August with 150 children, all boys. In total, 3,136 children arrived at the camp up to 14August. According to the historian Dragoje LukiÄ, a total of 3,336 children passed through the camp during its existence, aged between one and fourteen years old. One survivor, DuÅ¡anka Å mitran, who had previously been held at one of the sub-camps of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex, stated that she was dragged away from her <b>mother</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sub-camp and they were packed tightly into railway wagons for the journey.

5|$|After her Carlisle victories, Ferrier {{began to}} receive offers of singing engagements. Her first {{appearance}} {{as a professional}} vocalist, in autumn 1937, was at a harvest festival celebration in the village church at Aspatria. She was paid one guinea. After winning the gold cup at the 1938 Workington Festival, Ferrier sang Ma Curly-Headed Babby in a concert at Workington Opera House. Cecil McGivern, producer of a BBC Northern radio variety show, was in the audience and was sufficiently impressed to book her for the next edition of his programme, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 23 February 1939. This broadcastâher first as a vocalistâattracted wide attention, and led to more radio work, though for Ferrier the event was overshadowed {{by the death of}} her <b>mother</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of February. At the 1939 Carlisle Festival, Ferrier sang Richard Strauss's song All Souls' Day, a performance which particularly impressed one of the adjudicators, J. E. Hutchinson, a music teacher with a considerable reputation. Ferrier became his pupil and, under his guidance, began to extend her repertoire to include works by Bach, Handel, Brahms and Elgar.|$|E
5|$|After {{her first}} year of {{graduate}} school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in Raymond Pearl's laboratory, where she worked with rats and Drosophila, to earn money for tuition. After false starts with pit vipers and squirrels, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the pronephros in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 Carson {{was forced to leave}} Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family. In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging <b>mother.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled Romance Under the Waters. The series of fifty-two seven minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and {{in the work of the}} bureauâa task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the Chesapeake Bay, based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|Like her two predecessors, Ranavalona {{concluded}} a political marriage with Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony. The young queen's role was largely ceremonial as nearly all important political decisions {{continued to be}} made by the much older and more experienced prime minister. Ranavalona was frequently called upon to deliver formal speeches (kabary) to the public on behalf of Rainilaiarivony and would make appearances to inaugurate new public buildings, such as a hospital at Isoavinandriana and a girls' school at Ambodin'Andohalo. Throughout her reign, Ranavalona's aunt, Ramisindrazana, acted as an adviser and exercised considerable influence at court. Ranavalona's older sister, Rasendranoro, whose son Rakatomena and daughter Razafinandriamanitra lived with their <b>mother</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Rova, was also a close companion. An American journalist who visited her palace reported that Ranavalona spent much of her leisure time flying kites or playing lotto, a parlor game, with her relatives and other ladies at court. She also enjoyed knitting, needlework and crocheting and would frequently bring her latest craft project to work on at cabinet meetings. She had a great love of fine garments and was the only Malagasy sovereign to import the majority of her clothing from Paris rather than London.|$|E
