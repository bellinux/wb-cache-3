However, something can still be said about the structural properties of the system, like controllability. The more complicated equations can be interpreted in terms of virtual steering wheels placed on the off-axle joints with steering angle which is a non-linear feedback from the original configuration state. Quite remarkably, the extra singularities of the system have an explanation in terms of these virtual steering wheels. This is also sufficient to assert that the general n-trailer problem can be embedded into the corresponding multisteering n-trailer system. The <b>multi-chained</b> form available for this last system can be recovered also for the general n-trailer if we replace the extra steering inputs with the aforementioned feedback loops...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Computer Engineering, İzmir, 2010 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 85 - 92) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishx, 71 leavesAlthough most systems {{used for}} computation are concurrent systems, classical theories of computation are generally involved in sequential formalisms. Thus, mathematical methods are developed for modeling and analyzing {{the behavior of}} concurrent and reactive systems. One of these formal methods is Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), which is a process algebra proposed by Hoare in the 1970 s. Broad theory of CSP captures different properties of processes by using different approaches within a unifying formalization. Many security protocols are modeled with CSP and successfully verified using model-checking or theorem proving techniques. Unlike other authentication protocols modeled using CSP, each of the Efficient <b>Multi-chained</b> Stream Signature (EMSS) protocol messages {{are linked to the}} previous messages, forming hash chains, which introduce difficulties into the modeling and verification. In this thesis the EMSS stream authentication protocol is modeled using CSP and its authentication properties are verified using model checking, which in turn calls for building an infinite state model of the protocol that is also successfully reduced into a finite state model...|$|R
40|$|Formal {{methods are}} a popular means to specify and verify {{security}} properties {{of a variety}} of communication protocols. In this article we take a step towards the use of team automata for the analysis of security aspects in such protocols. To this aim, we define an insecure communication scenario for team automata that is general enough to encompass various communication protocols. We then reformulate the Generalized Non-Deducibility on Compositions schema—originally introduced in the context of process algebrae—in terms of team automata. Based on the resulting team automata framework, we subsequently develop two analysis strategies {{that can be used to}} verify security properties of communication protocols. Indeed, the paper concludes with two case studies in which we show how our framework can be used to prove integrity and secrecy in two different settings: We show how integrity is guaranteed in a team automaton model of a particular instance of the Efficient <b>Multi-chained</b> Stream Signature protocol, a communication protocol for signing digital streams that provides some robustness against packet loss, and we show how secrecy is preserved when a member of a multicast group leaves the group in a particular run of the complementary variable approach to the N-Root/Leaf pairwise keys protocol...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{theoretical}} {{investigation of the}} physical adsorption of neutral comb-polymers with an adsorbing skeleton and non-adsorbing side-chains on a flat surface. Such polymers are particularly interesting as "dynamic coating" matrices for bio-separations, especially for DNA sequencing, capillary electrophoresis and lab-on-chips. Separation performances are increased by coating the inner surface of the capillaries with neutral polymers. This method allows to screen the surface charges, thus to prevent electro-osmosis flow and adhesion of charged macromolecules (e. g. proteins) on the capillary walls. We identify three adsorption regimes: a "mushroom" regime, in which the coating is formed by strongly adsorbed skeleton loops and the side-chains anchored on the skeleton are in a swollen state, a "brush" regime, characterized by a uniform <b>multi-chains</b> coating with an extended layer of non-adsorbing side-chains and a non-adsorbed regime. By {{using a combination of}} mean field and scaling approaches, we explicitly derive asymptotic forms for the monomer concentration profiles, for the adsorption free energy and for the thickness of the adsorbed layer {{as a function of the}} skeleton and side-chains sizes and of the adsorption parameters. Moreover, we obtain the scaling laws for the transitions between the different regimes. These predictions can be checked by performing experiments aimed at investigating polymer adsorption, such as Neutron or X-ray Reflectometry, Ellipsometry, Quartz Microbalance, or Surface Force Apparatus.

The conformal limit of these models is studied and it is shown that the low-lying excitations for the incommensurate phases are not independent, because they are governed by the same magnetic field (chemical potential for excitations). A scenario for the transition from one to two space dimensions for the exactly integrable <b>multi-chain</b> quantum spin models is proposed and it is shown that the incommensured phases in an external magnetic field disappear {{in the limit of}} an infinite number of the coupled spin chains.
