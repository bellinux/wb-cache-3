If you’re happy with your current iPad, there’s no reason to dump it just because there’s a shinier, newer one. (This {{is not to say}} that millions of people won’t do just that. I mean: shiny!) If you’ve invested in iPad accessories such as a dock or case, keep in <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> probably won’t be able to use them with the new iPad." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the other}} semi-final Maguire beat Lee 6–4 in an error-strewn match which lasted four hours. After winning {{the first two}} frames Maguire lost the next three, but [...] "kept his cool" [...] to seal the victory. Maguire said the match was a [...] "battle" [...] {{and that he was}} {{surprised}} at how badly his opponents had played in the tournament, while Lee said he [...] "just blew up" [...] and that, [...] "When you’re as poor as that you get into such a state of <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can’t think straight".|$|E

500|$|Davis {{was happy}} to have an episode of his own, but was puzzled {{at some of the}} contradictions in the script, such as having him assassinate John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but being {{concerned}} with something as minor as keeping the Buffalo Bills from winning the Super Bowl. Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope {{in the back of your}} <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E
500|$|Romeo Void {{formed at}} the San Francisco Art Institute in February 1979. Vocalist Debora Iyall {{occasionally}} visited the Bay Area to see Patti Smith perform. She {{decided to pursue}} an art education after reading a fortune cookie. [...] "It was in the late '70s at the Indochina Friendship Booth at the annual Fourth of July streetfair in Eureka, California," [...] she said. [...] "I got a fortune cookie that said 'Art is your fate, don't debate.' That next January, I was enrolled in an art school in San Francisco." [...] She began frequenting the Mabuhay Gardens, a popular nightclub, to see local alternative rock groups like The Nuns, the Mutants, Crime, and the Avengers. She also formed the Mummers and Poppers, a punk parody band that covered 1960s tunes with guitarist Peter Woods, Charles Hagan and drummer Jay Derrah, [...] Iyall was originally hesitant to perform because she was overweight: [...] "After seeing Patti Smith, I still had it in my <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had to be skinny to be up there , but after going to the Mabuhay [...] you just do whatever you want, be whoever you want, just make it happen." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] said Mrs. Lecks; [...] "there's somethin' I {{want to talk}} to you about. Mrs. Aleshine and me {{have made}} up our <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> ought to be hurried up a little about poppin' the {{question}} to Miss Ruth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your deed, {{in saving}} Colonel Houghton's life at what seemed the {{sacrifice}} of your own, had been a sore trial and a grief to all of us.

2500|$|Frumious: Combination of [...] "fuming" [...] and [...] "furious". In Hunting of the Snark Carroll comments, [...] "ake the {{two words}} 'fuming' and 'furious'. Make up your <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will say both words, but leave it {{unsettled}} which you will say first. Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts incline ever so little towards 'fuming', you will say 'fuming-furious'; if they turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards 'furious', you will say 'furious-fuming'; {{but if you have}} the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say 'frumious'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sessions {{focused the}} {{majority}} of his criticism on Kagan's treatment of the military while she was dean of Harvard Law School. During her tenure, Kagan reinstated the practice of requiring military recruiters to coordinate their activities through a campus veterans organization, rather than the school's Office of Career Services. Kagan argued that she was trying to comply with a law known as the Solomon Amendment, which barred federal funds from any college or university that did not grant military recruiters equal access to campus facilities. Sessions asserted that Kagan's action was a violation of the Solomon Amendment and that it amounted to [...] "demeaning and punishing the military". He also argued that her action showed a willingness to place her politics above the law, and questioned [...] "whether she had the intellectual honesty, the clarity of <b>mind,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would expect on the Supreme Court".|$|E
2500|$|Military law {{requires}} commanding officers {{and those in}} authority to demonstrate virtue, honor, patriotism, and subordination in all that they do. In the 1990s, the army officially adopted what {{have come to be}} known as [...] "The 7 Army Values", which are summarized with the acronym [...] "LDRSHIP". LDRSHIP stands for Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage. While this acronym is relatively new, the ideas it represents have been at the heart of military service for generations. Similarly, the motto [...] "Duty, honor, country" [...] is the standard of the U.S. military. Military brats are raised in a culture that stresses LDRSHIP, Duty, Honor, and Country. Their strict (outward) adherence to military values is what separates most from their civilian peers. Children of military personnel often mirror the values, ideals, and attitudes of their parents more than children of civilians. Marine General Peter Pace, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a 2006 interview, [...] "There's no way, in my <b>mind,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can be successful in the military and have a family unless that family does, in fact, appreciate your service to the country." [...] Pace also wrote in an April 2006 letter honoring the Month of the Military Child: [...] "You [...] are American patriots and role models for us all." ...|$|E

Now, for God's sake, dont let us have any row." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} in 1986 he said: [...] Real life honestly portrayed is sufficiently dramatic in itself.

6000|$|... "Well, no, sir," [...] {{the agent}} said, {{in a tone}} of some embarrassment. [...] "You see the tenants had made up their <b>minds</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> ought to come in a {{different}} sort of style, and so without asking me about it they ordered an open carriage to be here to meet you. I knew nothing about it until last night. The dog cart is here and will take up your luggage." ...|$|R
