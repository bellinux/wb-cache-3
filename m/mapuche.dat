Aloe vera hung backwards behind or near a door was thought to ward off vampiric beings in South American superstition. Aztec mythology described tales of the Cihuateteo, skeletal-faced spirits {{of those who died}} in childbirth who stole children and entered into sexual liaisons with the living, driving them mad.|$|E
5|$|Three deputies from Coquimbo, Santiago and Concepción {{organized}} a new government, and proposed San Martín as Supreme Director of Chile. He declined the offer and proposed O'Higgins in his stead: he {{recommended that the}} Supreme Director should be someone from Chile. San Martín would instead organize the navy to take the fight to Peru. He established a {{local chapter of the}} lodge of Rational Knights, named as Logia Lautaro, in reference to <b>mapuche</b> leader Lautaro.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the people}} from Pichilemu are Catholic, as of the 2002 census, 7,611 persons (83.44%), well above the {{national}} and regional average (69.96% and 79.08%, respectively); the evangelical population is considerably lower, at only 689 people (7.55%); 361 (3.96%) said they were Atheists or Agnostic individuals, while the remaining 460 (5.04%) are part of other religions. Based on information from the Casen survey, twenty-four persons living in Pichilemu declared themselves as Aymaras in 2006, and in 2009, 390 people said {{they were part of}} the <b>Mapuche</b> indigenous ethnic group; the survey revealed no one living in Pichilemu claimed to be either of the Atacameños or of the Rapa Nui indigenous peoples.|$|E
5|$|Orélie-Antoine {{felt that}} the {{indigenous}} peoples {{would be better served}} in negotiations with the surrounding powers by a European leader, and was accordingly elected by a group of <b>Mapuche</b> loncos (chieftains) to be their king. He made efforts to gain international recognition, and attempted to involve the French government in his project, but these efforts proved unsuccessful: the French consul concluded that Tounens was insane, and Araucania and Patagonia was never recognized by any country. The Chileans primarily ignored Orélie-Antoine and his kingdom, at least initially, and simply went on with the occupation of the Araucanía, a historical process which concluded in 1883 with Chile establishing control over the region. In the process, Orélie-Antoine was captured in 1862, and imprisoned in an insane asylum in Chile. After several fruitless attempts to return to his kingdom (thwarted by Chilean and Argentine authorities), Tounens died penniless in 1878 in Tourtoirac, France. The current pretender, Prince Antoine IV, lives in France. The previous pretender renounced his claims to the Patagonian throne, even though a few Mapuches continue to recognise the Araucanian monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The FMA IAe 33 Pulqui II (in the {{indigenous}} language <b>Mapuche,</b> Pulqúi: Arrow) was a jet fighter aircraft designed by Kurt Tank {{in the late}} 1940s in Argentina, under the Perón government, and built by the Fábrica Militar de Aviones (FMA). Embodying many of the design elements of the wartime Focke-Wulf Ta 183, an unrealized fighter project, the FMA envisioned the IAe 33 Pulqui II as a successor to the postwar Gloster Meteor F4 in service with the Fuerza Aérea Argentina. The Pulqui II's development was comparatively problematic and lengthy, {{with two of the}} four prototypes being lost in fatal crashes. Despite one of the prototypes being successfully tested in combat during the Revolución Libertadora, the political, economic and technical challenges faced by the project meant that the IAe 33 was unable to reach its full potential, and the Argentine government ultimately chose to purchase F-86 Sabres from the United States in lieu of continuing development of {{the indigenous}} fighter to production status.|$|E
25|$|According to the 2012 Census, 10% of the Chilean population, {{including}} the Rapa Nui (a Polynesian people) of Easter Island, was indigenous, although most show {{varying degrees of}} mixed heritage. Many are descendants of the <b>Mapuche,</b> and live in Santiago, Araucanía and the lake district. The <b>Mapuche</b> successfully fought off defeat in the first 300–350 years of Spanish rule during the Arauco War. Relations with the new Chilean Republic were good until the Chilean state decided to occupy their lands. During the Occupation of Araucanía the <b>Mapuche</b> surrendered to the country's army in the 1880s. Their land was opened to settlement by Chileans and Europeans. Conflict over <b>Mapuche</b> land rights continues to the present.|$|E
25|$|In December 2008, after protesters {{from the}} <b>Mapuche</b> {{community}} staged a roadblock, the Chubut Provincial Supreme Court suspended {{a lower court}} order evicting a <b>Mapuche</b> family from land they had occupied since 1940. The protesters expressed concern that Chubut Province would evict more indigenous families to provide concessions to mining companies.|$|E

25|$|Conquest {{took place}} gradually, and the Europeans {{suffered}} repeated setbacks. A massive <b>Mapuche</b> insurrection {{that began in}} 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death {{and the destruction of}} many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the <b>Mapuche</b> and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of slavery by the Spanish crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the <b>Mapuche</b> intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite royal prohibitions, relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference.|$|E
25|$|Foreign investors, {{including}} Italian multinational Benetton Group, Ted Turner, Joseph Lewis and the environmentalist Douglas Tompkins, own major land areas. This {{situation has}} caused several conflicts with local inhabitants and {{the governments of}} Chile and Argentina; for example the opposition by Douglas Tompkins to the planned route for Carretera Austral in Pumalín Park. A scandal is also brewing about two properties owned by Ted Turner: the estancia La Primavera, located inside Nahuel Huapi National Park; and the estancia Collón Cura. Benetton has faced criticism from <b>Mapuche</b> organizations, including <b>Mapuche</b> International Link, over its purchase of traditional <b>Mapuche</b> lands in Patagonia. The Curiñanco-Nahuelquir family was evicted from their land in 2002 following Benetton's claim to it, but the land was restored in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Cut off to {{the north}} by desert, to the south by the <b>Mapuche,</b> to the east by the Andes Mountains, and to the west by the ocean, Chile {{became one of the}} most centralized, {{homogeneous}} colonies in Spanish America. Serving as a sort of frontier garrison, the colony found itself with the mission of forestalling encroachment by both the <b>Mapuche</b> and Spain's European enemies, especially the British and the Dutch. Buccaneers and English adventurers menaced the colony in addition to the <b>Mapuche,</b> as was shown by Sir Francis Drake's 1578 raid on Valparaíso, the colony's principal port. Chile hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas, making it one of the most militarized of the Spanish possessions, as well as a drain on the treasury of the Viceroyalty of Peru.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, a French adventurer Orelie-Antoine de Tounens proclaimed himself {{king of the}} Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia of the <b>Mapuche.</b>|$|E

25|$|Polynesian {{contact with}} the prehispanic <b>Mapuche</b> culture in central-south Chile has been {{suggested}} because of apparently similar cultural traits, including words like toki (stone axes and adzes), hand clubs similar to the Māori wahaika, the sewn-plank canoe as used on Chiloe island, the curanto earth oven (Polynesian umu) common in southern Chile, fishing techniques such as stone wall enclosures, a hockey-like game, and other potential parallels. Some strong westerlies and El Niño wind blow directly from central-east Polynesia to the <b>Mapuche</b> region, between Concepcion and Chiloe. A direct connection from New Zealand is possible, sailing with the Roaring Forties. In 1834, some escapees from Tasmania arrived at Chiloe Island after sailing for 43 days.|$|E
25|$|Spain conquered and colonized Chile in the mid-16th century, {{replacing}} Inca rule {{in northern}} and central Chile, but failing {{to conquer the}} independent <b>Mapuche</b> who inhabited south-central Chile. After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818, Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic. In the 19th century, Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth, ending <b>Mapuche</b> resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific (1879–83) after defeating Peru and Bolivia. In the 1960s and 1970s the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil. This development culminated with the 1973 Chilean coup d'état that overthrew Salvador Allende's democratically elected left-wing government and instituted a 16-year-long right-wing military dictatorship that left more than 3,000 people dead or missing. The regime, headed by Augusto Pinochet, ended in 1990 after it lost a referendum in 1988 and was succeeded by a center-left coalition which ruled through four presidencies until 2010.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 {{a census}} took place, {{directly}} asking the public whether they considered themselves {{as part of}} any of the eight Chilean ethnic groups, {{regardless of whether or not}} they maintained their culture, traditions and language, and 4.6 percent of the population (692,192 people) fitted that description of indigenous peoples in Chile. Of that number, 87.3% declared themselves <b>Mapuche.</b> Most of the indigenous population shows varying degrees of mixed ancestry.|$|E
25|$|De Tounens {{returned}} to Araucanía where many <b>Mapuche</b> tribes were again preparing {{to fight the}} incursions of the Chilean Army during the occupation of Araucanía. In 1862 de Tounens proceeded to visit other tribes as well. However, his servant, Juan Bautista Rosales, contacted Chilean authorities who had de Tounens arrested. They put him on trial {{and were going to}} send him into an asylum when the French consulate intervened and he was deported to France.|$|E
25|$|A {{spin-off}} {{from increased}} tourism {{has been the}} buying of often enormous tracts of land by foreigners, often as a prestige purchase rather than for agriculture. Buyers have included Sylvester Stallone, Ted Turner and Christopher Lambert, and most notably Luciano Benetton, Patagonia's largest landowner. His Compañia de Tierras Sud has brought new techniques to the ailing sheep-rearing industry and sponsored museums and community facilities, but has been controversial particularly for its treatment of local <b>Mapuche</b> communities.|$|E
25|$|Music in Chile {{ranges from}} folkloric, popular and {{classical}} music. Its large geography generates different musical styles in the north, center {{and south of}} the country, including also Easter Island and <b>Mapuche</b> music. The national dance is the cueca. Another form of traditional Chilean song, though not a dance, is the tonada. Arising from music imported by the Spanish colonists, it is distinguished from the cueca by an intermediate melodic section and a more prominent melody.|$|E
25|$|Orélie-Antoine de Tounens {{was born}} May 12, 1825 in Chourgnac, Dordogne. He moved to Coquimbo in Chile in 1858 and {{spent two years}} in Valparaíso and Santiago, {{studying}} Spanish and forming social connections. Later he moved to Valdivia where he met two French merchants, Lachaise and Desfontaines. He explained his plans to them about founding a French colony in the Araucanía. 1860 he moved to Araucanía among the <b>Mapuche</b> who, at the time, were de jure and de facto an independent nation.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 16th century, Mapuche-speaking agriculturalists {{penetrated}} the western Andes and from there across into the eastern plains and down to the far south. Through confrontation and technological ability, they came to dominate the other peoples of the region {{in a short period of}} time, and are the principal indigenous community today. The <b>Mapuche</b> model of domination through technological superiority and armed confrontation was later repeated as Europeans implemented a succeeding but conceptually identical cycle, essentially replacing the position of the former dominators with a new, albeit predominately European class.|$|E
25|$|Rodeo is the country's {{national}} {{sport and}} is {{practiced in the}} more rural areas of the nation. A sport similar to hockey called chueca was played by the <b>Mapuche</b> people during the Spanish conquest. Skiing and snowboarding are practiced at ski centers located in the Central Andes, and in southern ski centers near to cities as Osorno, Puerto Varas, Temuco and Punta Arenas. surfing is popular at some coastal towns. Polo is professionally practiced within Chile, with the country achieving top prize in the 2008 and 2015 World Polo Championship.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} spanned {{from the}} Atlantic Ocean to the Andes, and had several sections of attack. Félix Aldao from the Mendoza Province attacked the <b>Mapuche</b> {{in the south}} of his province and in Neuquen. Ruiz Huidobro, under the command of Facundo Quiroga, faced the Ranqueles in San Luis and Córdoba. Rosas led the section in the Buenos Aires province. Although de Rosas organized the overall campaign, the primary commander in the field was Quiroga. It was expected Chile would contribute additional military support; however, the nation was unable to do so, due to a mutiny, and assassination attempts, against Diego Portales. De Rosas's command left Buenos Aires on March 22, 1833.|$|E
25|$|The lack {{of trained}} {{military}} {{was one of}} the most pressing difficulties of the revolutionary government in Buenos Aires. Besides the Patricios Regiment and other corps formed during the British invasions, the only troops with some experience were the Blandengues, lancers militia recruited to patrol the borders of the territories still controlled by indigenous people (<b>mapuche</b> and ranquel). Until 1812, with the arrival of veterans from the Napoleonic Wars, that would join as officers, the army was basically a militia. Most of the commanders were civilians or junior officers, put in charge more for their political leanings, status in society or charisma than for their military capacity.|$|E
25|$|In America {{some of the}} Native American tribes give reverence to the {{rattlesnake}} as {{grandfather and}} king of snakes {{who is able to}} give fair winds or cause tempest. Among the Hopi of Arizona the serpent figures largely in one of the dances. The rattlesnake was worshiped in the Natchez temple of the sun and the Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl was a feathered serpent-god. In many Meso-American cultures, the serpent was regarded as a portal between two worlds. The tribes of Peru are said to have adored great snakes in the pre-Inca days and in Chile the <b>Mapuche</b> made a serpent figure in their deluge beliefs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century, tourism became an ever more {{important}} part of Patagonia's economy. Originally a remote backpacking destination, the region has attracted increasing numbers of upmarket visitors, cruise passengers rounding Cape Horn or visiting Antarctica, and adventure and activity holiday-makers. Principal tourist attractions include the Perito Moreno glacier, the Valdés Peninsula, the Argentine Lake District and Ushuaia and Tierra del Fuego (the city is also a jumping off place for travel to Antarctica, bringing in still more visitors). Tourism has created new markets locally and for export for traditional crafts such as <b>Mapuche</b> handicrafts, guanaco textiles, and confectionery and preserves.|$|E
25|$|In 1833 Juan Manuel de Rosas in Buenos Aires Province {{and other}} {{military}} leaders in the Cuyo region coordinated offensives to try to exterminate the resistant indigenous tribes, but only Rosas' expedition achieved some success. By this time Chile had founded Punta Arenas in Magellan Strait in 1845, which threatened the Argentine claims in Patagonia. Later in 1861 Chile began the occupation of the Araucanía, which alarmed Argentine authorities because of its rival's growing influence in the zone. Chile had defeated the <b>Mapuche</b> in their central region. This indigenous tribe had strong language and cultural ties to the nomadic tribes {{on the east side}} of the Andes, with whom they share the same language.|$|E
25|$|From {{the period}} between early {{agricultural}} settlements {{and up to the}} late pre-Hispanic period, northern Chile was a region of Andean culture that was influenced by altiplano traditions spreading to the coastal valleys of the north, while southern regions were areas of <b>Mapuche</b> cultural activities. Throughout the colonial period following the conquest, and during the early Republican period, the country's culture was dominated by the Spanish. Other European influences, primarily English, French, and German began in the 19th century and have continued to this day. German migrants influenced the Bavarian style rural architecture and cuisine in the south of Chile in cities such as Valdivia, Frutillar, Puerto Varas, Osorno, Temuco, Puerto Octay, Llanquihue, Faja Maisan, Pitrufquén, Victoria, Pucón and Puerto Montt.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Mapuche</b> and Huilliche Indians of Chile {{cultivated}} {{the female}} strawberry species until 1551, when the Spanish came {{to conquer the}} land. In 1765, a European explorer recorded the cultivation of F. chiloensis, the Chilean strawberry. At first introduction to Europe, the plants grew vigorously but produced no fruit. It was discovered in 1766 that the female plants could only be pollinated by plants that produced large fruit: F. moschata, F. virginiana, and F. ananassa. This is when the Europeans became aware that plants {{had the ability to}} produce male-only or female-only flowers. As more large-fruit producing plants were cultivated the Chilean strawberry slowly decreased in population in Europe, except for around Brest where the Chilean strawberry thrived. The decline of the Chilean strawberry was caused by F. ananassa.|$|E
25|$|Stone tool {{evidence}} indicates humans sporadically frequented the Monte Verde valley area {{as long as}} 18,500 years ago. About 10,000 years ago, migrating Native Americans settled in fertile valleys and coastal areas of what is present-day Chile. Settlement sites from very early human habitation include Monte Verde, Cueva del Milodon and the Pali Aike Crater's lava tube. The Incas briefly extended their empire into what is now northern Chile, but the <b>Mapuche</b> (or Araucanians as they were known by the Spaniards) successfully resisted many attempts by the Inca Empire to subjugate them, despite their lack of state organization. They fought against the Sapa Inca Tupac Yupanqui and his army. The result of the bloody three-day confrontation known as the Battle of the Maule was that the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the Maule river.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the period}} of European colonization, Argentina was {{relatively}} sparsely populated by a wide number of diverse cultures with different social organizations, which {{can be divided into}} three main groups. The first group are basic hunters and food gatherers without development of pottery, such as the Selknam and Yaghan in the extreme south. The second group are advanced hunters and food gatherers which include the Puelche, Querandí and Serranos in the center-east; and the Tehuelche in the south—all of them conquered by the <b>Mapuche</b> spreading from Chile—and the Kom and Wichi in the north. The last group are farmers with pottery, like the Charrúa, Minuane and Guaraní in the northeast, with slash and burn semisedentary existence; the advanced Diaguita sedentary trading culture in the northwest, which was conquered by the Inca Empire around 1480; the Toconoté and Hênîa and Kâmîare in the country's center, and the Huarpe in the center-west, a culture that raised llama cattle and was strongly influenced by the Incas.|$|E
