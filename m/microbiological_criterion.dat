40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} value {{of each of the}} Duke {{criteria}} for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE). METHODS: Detailed review was done of charts of all cases discharged with the diagnosis of IE, and classification as 'definite', 'possible' and 'rejected' cases was made according to the Duke criteria. The diagnostic impact of each criterion was assessed by reclassifying each 'definite' case after subtraction of each individual criterion and by reclassifying each 'possible' and 'rejected' case after addition of each individual criterion. RESULTS: From 1983 to 1993, 179 cases were identified in the databases of two hospitals. When the Duke criteria were applied, 124 (6967 %) were classed as 'definite', 43 (2466 %) as 'possible' and 12 (763 %) as 'rejected' cases. Of the 67 pathologically proven cases, 52 (78610 %) were 'definite' cases when the criteria were applied before pathology. If the major <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> is subtracted, 53 % (69 %) of the 'definite' cases become 'possible' or 'rejected'. When the echocardiographic criterion is subtracted, 34 % (68 %) of the 'definite' cases become possible or rejected. Among minor criteria, fever and predisposition, contributing to the classification of respectively 31 % (68 %) and 27 % (68 %) of the 'definite' cases, were the most powerful. On the other hand, the minor <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> and immunologic phenomena were responsible for the classification of only 2 % (62 %) and 6 % (64 %) respectively, of the 'definite' cases. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the criterion examined, 47 - 98 % of the 'definite' cases of IE would remain 'definite' if this particular criterion were absent. The major <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> had the highest relative importance. In this retrospective study, in which only 32 (18 %) patients had a transesophageal echocardiogram, the echocardiogram contributed to 15 % (66 %) of the 'definite' cases according to the major criterion and to 19 % (66 %) according to the minor criterion. This study illustrates that the degree of certainty of the diagnosis of IE often depends on the presence/absence of only one criterion...|$|E

MethodsDetailed review was done of charts of all cases discharged with the diagnosis of IE, and classification as ‘definite’, ‘possible’ and ‘rejected’ cases was made according to the Duke criteria. The diagnostic impact of each criterion was assessed by reclassifying each ‘definite’ case after subtraction of each individual criterion and by reclassifying each ‘possible’ and ‘rejected’ case after addition of each individual criterion. ResultsFrom 1983 to 1993, 179 cases were identified in the databases of two hospitals. When the Duke criteria were applied, 124 (69 ± 7 %) were classed as ‘definite’, 43 (24 ± 6 %) as ‘possible’ and 12 (7 ± 3 %) as ‘rejected’ cases. Of the 67 pathologically proven cases, 52 (78 ± 10 %) were ‘definite’ cases when the criteria were applied before pathology. If the major <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> is subtracted, 53 % (± 9 %) of the ‘definite’ cases become ‘possible’ or ‘rejected’.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of postsurgical mediastinitis (PSM) among patients with sternal wound complication (SWC) after cardiac surgery is sometimes difficult, as fever, elevated C-reactive protein levels, and chest pain {{can be caused}} by a general inflammatory reaction to the operative trauma and/or sternal dehiscence without infection. The definitions of PSM usually used emphasize clinical signs and symptoms easily observed by the surgeon. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate whether the use of standardized multiple tissue sampling, optimal culturing methods, and strain typing, together with a <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> for infection, could identify more infected patients than clinical assessment alone. Patients reexplored due to SWC after cardiac artery bypass grafting (CABG) or heart valve replacement (HVR) with or without CABG performed at the Department for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery at the Uppsala University Hospital between 10 March 1998 and 9 September 2000 were investigated prospectively. Tissue samples were taken from the sternum or adjacent mediastinal tissue, preferably before the administration of antibiotics. Culturing was performed both directly (on agar plates) and using enrichment broth. Species identification was performed by standard methods, and strain typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A total of 41 cases with at least five tissue samples each were included in the study group. Of these patients, 32 were infected according to the <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> (i. e., the same strain was found in ≥ 50 % of the samples). Staphylococcus epidermidis was the primary pathogen in 38 % of the cases (12 / 32), S. aureus was the primary pathogen in 31 % (10 / 32), P. acnes was the primary pathogen in 25 % (8 / 32), and S. simulans and S. haemolyticus were the primary pathogens in 3 % (1 / 32) each. All cases of S. aureus infection and 86 % (12 / 14) of coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) infections were identified from primary cultures. All cases fulfilling the <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> for S. aureus infection were clinically diagnosed as cases of infection, but among the 14 cases fulfilling the criterion for microbiological {{diagnosis of}} CoNS infection, only 10 appeared to qualify clinically as cases of infection. Among the patients with sternal dehiscence in whom a microbiological diagnosis was established, 67 % (12 / 18) had a CoNS infection, compared to 14 % (2 / 14) of those without sternal dehiscence. The difference was statistically significant. PSM caused by S. aureus is readily identified by the surgeon, whereas 30 % of cases with CoNS infections may be misinterpreted as noninfected. Multiple sampling before administration of antibiotics, primary culturing on agar plates, species identification, strain typing, and susceptibility testing should be used to ensure a fast and microbiologically correct diagnosis which identifies the primary pathogen and infected patients among those with minor infective symptoms. The role of P. acnes as a possible cause of PSM needs further investigation. PSM caused by CoNS is significantly related to sternal dehiscence...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of water}} {{treatment}} plant sludge to restore degraded soils is customary agricultural practice, {{but it could be}} dangerous {{from the point of view}} of both health and the environment. A transient increase of either pathogenic or indicator microbial populations, whose persistence in time is variable and attributed to the characteristics of the soil (types of materials in the soil), any amendments (origin and treatments it has undergone) or the weather (humidity and temperature mainly), has often been detected in soils treated with this kind of waste.

40|$|Concerns about {{foodborne}} salmonellosis {{have led}} many countries to introduce microbiological criteria for certain food products. If such criteria are not well-grounded in science, {{they could be}} an unjustified obstacle to trade. Raw poultry products {{are an important part}} of the global food market. Import and export ambiguities and regulatory confusion resulting from different Salmonella requirements were the impetus for convening an international group of scientific experts from 16 countries to discuss the scientific and technical issues that affect the setting of a <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> for Salmonella contamination of raw chicken. A particular concern for the group was the use of criteria implying a zero tolerance for Salmonella and suggesting complete absence of the pathogen. The notion can be interpreted differently by various stakeholders and was considered inappropriate because there is neither an effective means of eliminating Salmonella from raw poultry nor any practical method for verifying its absence. Therefore, it may be more useful at present to set food safety metrics that involve reductions in hazard levels. Such terms as "zero tolerance" or "absence of a microbe" in relation to raw poultry should be avoided unless defined and explained by international agreement. Risk assessment provides a more meaningful approach than a zero tolerance philosophy, and new metrics, such as performance objectives that are linked to human health outcomes, should be utilized throughout the food chain to help define risk and identify ways to reduce adverse effects on public healt...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{prevalence}} of acquired resistance to streptogramins, macrolides, and lincosamides and the genetic background of this resistance {{was investigated in}} Enterococcus faecium strains isolated from food-producing animals and hospital patients 45 years after the ban of streptogramins as growth promoters. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D), virginiamycin M 1 (virgM 1), erythromycin (ery), tylosin (tyl), and lincomycin (lin) were determined by the agar dilution method for E. faecium isolates derived from pigs (80), broilers (45), and hospitalized patients (103). Resistance or susceptibility was interpreted using a <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> and breakpoints recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), if available. The isolates were also screened by PCR for erm(B), lnu(A), lnu(B), mef(A/E), vat(D), vat(E), vga(A), vga(B), and vgb(A) genes. Acquired resistance to Q/D, virgM 1, ery, tyl, and lin was detected in 34 %, 96 %, 46 %, 46 %, and 69 % of the porcine strains, respectively. For broiler strains this was 15 % (Q/D), 98 % (virgM 1), 69 % (ery), 71 % (tyl), and 89 % (lin) and for human strains 23 % (Q/D), 65 % (virgM 1), 54 % (ery), 52 % (tyl), and 60 % (lin). Strains showing cross-resistance against macrolides and lincosamides almost always carried the erm(B) gene. This gene was present in 64 % of the Q/D-resistant isolates. Only in two human and three broiler Q/D- and virgM 1 -resistant isolates, {{a combination of the}} erm(B) and vat(D) or vat(E) genes was found.

40|$|Abstract- Staphylococcal food {{poisoning}} {{is one of}} the most common foodborne diseases resulting from the ingestion of staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) preformed in foods by enterotoxigenic strains of coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), mainly Staphylococcus aureus. The presence of enterotoxigenic strains of coagulase-positive staphylococci in raw milk during the production process leads to the contamination of products and outbreaks of alimentary intoxication. The problem of Staphylococcus aureus in cheese remains significant on a global level. Domestic cheese contaminated with enterotoxigenic staphylococci can result in the formation of enterotoxin, which can produce foodborne illness when the product is ingested.

40|$|Quantitative {{microbiological}} risk assessment (QMRA) allows evaluating {{the public health}} impact of food safety targets to support the control of foodborne pathogens. We estimate the risk reduction of setting microbiological criteria (MCs) for Campylobacter on broiler meat in 25 European countries, applying quantitative data from the 2008 EU baseline survey. We demonstrate that risk based MCs can be derived without explicit consideration of Food Safety Objectives or Performance Objectives. Published QMRA models for the consumer phase and dose response provide a relation between Campylobacter concentration on skin samples and the attending probability of illness for the consumer. Probabilistic modelling is used to evaluate a set of potential MCs. We present the percentage of batches not complying with the potential criteria, {{in relation to the}} risk reduction attending totally efficient treatment of these batches. We find different risk estimates and different impacts of MCs in different countries, which offers a practical and flexible tool for risk managers to select the most appropriate MC by weighing the costs (i. e. non-compliant batches) and the benefits (i. e. reduction in public health risk). Our analyses show that the estimated percentage of batches not complying with the MC is better correlated with the risk estimate than surrogate risk measures like the flock prevalence or the arithmetic mean concentration of bacteria on carcasses, and would therefore be a good measure for the risk of Campylobacter on broiler meat in a particular country. Two uncertain parameters in the model are the ratio of within- and between-flock variances in concentrations, and the transition factor of skin sample concentrations to concentrations on the meat. Sensitivity analyses show that these parameters have a considerable effect on our results, but the impact of their uncertainty is small compared to that of the parameters defining the <b>Microbiological</b> <b>Criterion</b> and the concentration on the meat...|$|E
40|$|The {{present report}} aims to {{determine}} the currency of the present system for healthrelated control of frozen fishery products at border inspection posts, {{with regard to the}} pathogenic species of the genus Vibrio and more specifically, V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus. In view of the current scientific knowledge and risk assessment, the application of microbiological criteria at border inspection posts is justified as an additional and complementary control measure. With regard to V. cholerae specifically, it is recommended to apply a zero-tolerance criterion without distinguishing between serotypes. In case of serotypes other than O: 1 and O: 139, it is recommended to identify the products with the greatest risk for consumers and to adopt effective surveillance measures. With respect to V. parahaemolyticus, the application of a maximum limit of 102 cfu/g is considered adequate and the <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> and sampling plan established at border inspection posts for this species are adequate and sufficient. In catches from areas at risk, a special surveillance plan should be established as a preliminary step for the adoption of another kind of criterion. Similarly, it is recommended to extend the surveillance over fish and shellfish from areas at risk to V. vulnificus. In addition, it is recommended to keep certain caution with respect to the same areas (at risk) for any other species of Vibrio, particularly those considered here. Furthermore, it should be highlighted that the temperature at which fish and fish products are maintained is of critical importance in the control of potential outbreaks due to these micro-organisms.

40|$|Foodstuffs {{should not}} contain {{microorganisms}} or their toxins or metabolites in quantities suggesting an unacceptable risk for human health. The detection of food hazards in foods is performed by several tests that produce results {{dependent on the}} analytical method used: an analytical reference method, defined as standard, is associated with each <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> laid down in Regulation 2073 / 2005 /EC, but, analytical methods other than the reference ones, in particular more rapid methods, could be used. Combined screening methods performed by real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are currently validated as alternative methods according to the ISO 16140 : 2003 and certified by the Association Française de Normalisation. However, the positive results obtained with these alternative methods, the investigated molecular relations that resulted positive have to be confirmed with cultural methods using the same enrichment media in which the molecular screening was performed. Since {{it is necessary to}} assess if these testing schemes provide equivalent guarantees of food safety, the aim of this retrospective study is to analyse the data collected, from 2012 to 2014 by Emilia Romagna Region in the field of Piano Regionale Alimenti (Food Regional Plan) during official controls monitoring food samples of animal and other than animal origin. Records performed by combined methods of molecular screening of Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes and thermophilic Campylobacter and cultural confirmation results were gathered together and the results were compared in order to assess the sensitivity of the methods. A total of 10, 604 food samples were considered in this study: the comparison of the data revealed that the RT-PCR method detected Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, and thermophilic Campylobacter in 2. 18, 3. 85 and 3. 73 % of the samples, respectively, whereas by using cultural method these pathogens were isolated in 0. 43, 1. 57 and 1. 57 % of samples, respectively. In spite of the use of the same enrichment broth, the RT-PCR method disclosed a percentage of positive samples that was negative to cultural examination ranging between 20 and 43 %, with a PCR/culture ratio between 2. 37 to 5. 00.

40|$|CONTEXT: Rhodococcus equi (R. equi) is an {{important}} cause of bronchopneumonia in foals. Antimicrobial susceptibility data for equine R. equi isolates are still scarce. The goal of the current research {{was to determine the}} antimicrobial susceptibility of recent equine R. equi isolates. MAIN CONCLUSION: Acquired antimicrobial resistance towards macrolides in R. equi isolates from Belgian foals is not very prevalent. The presence of low level acquired resistance towards rifampicin might be clinically relevant and can be attributed to point mutations in the rpoB gene. APPROACH: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on twenty-three R. equi isolates with the agar dilution assay. using Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5 % sheep blood (rifampicin, the macrolides and tetracycline) or 5 % lysed horse blood (sulfisoxazole and trimethoprim). Plates were incubated at 35 °C for 20 - 24 hours in an aerobic atmosphere. Since no clinical breakpoints or wild type cut-off values are available for R. equi, acquired resistance was assumed when MIC values showed a bimodal or multimodal distribution or tailing. The two isolates showing acquired resistance towards rifampicin and three at random selected wild type isolates were used for PCR amplification and sequencing of the rpoB gene. RESULTS: The ranges of MIC values were similar to MIC ranges described earlier. The distribution of the MIC values for the macrolides, tetracycline, sulfisoxazole and trimethoprim showed a unimodal distribution. The distribution of the MIC values for rifampicin showed a trimodal distribution with two isolates (8. 7 %) showing low level acquired resistance. One isolate had an MIC value of 1 µg/ml and one isolate showed an MIC value of 8 µg/ml, while the MIC range of the wild type population was 0. 06 – 0. 25 µg/ml. The three wild type isolates showed identical rpoB sequences. The isolates showing acquired resistance contained point mutations in the rpoB gene when compared to the wild type isolates at the amino acids His 526 and Ser 531, respectively. The isolate with MIC 1 µg/ml showed a His 526 Asn mutation. The isolate with MIC 8 µg/ml showed a Ser 531 Leu mutation. INTERPRETATION: There was no acquired resistance towards the tested antimicrobial agents according to the <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion,</b> except for rifampicin. Considering that there are no veterinary clinical breakpoints for R. equi and that the therapeutic result is also strongly dependent on the stage of infection, the lack of acquired resistance does not guarantee a successful therapy. On the other hand, the presence of acquired resistance can indeed hamper the in vivo efficiency of the antimicrobial agent. Even though the current collection of isolates is relatively small, these results suggest that acquired antimicrobial resistance against macrolides is not very common in recent equine isolates obtained in Belgium. The presence of rifampicin resistance in more than 8 % of the isolates emphasizes the importance of the combination therapy (rifampicin + macrolide). Even though the clinical importance of low and high level resistance is currently not described, there are serious indications that at least high level resistance is clinically relevant. SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: The current results acknowledge that the combination therapy (rifampicin + macrolide) remains first choice antimicrobial therapy for treating rhodococcosis in horses in Belgium...|$|E
