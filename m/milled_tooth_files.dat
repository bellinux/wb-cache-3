5000|$|Modern {{commercial}} {{rolling cutter}} bits usually employ three cones {{to contain the}} cutting elements, although two cone or (rarely) four cone arrangements are sometimes seen. These bits mainly fall into two classes depending on the manufacture of the cutting elements or [...] "teeth". Steel-tooth bits have cones that have wedge-shaped <b>teeth</b> <b>milled</b> directly in the cone steel itself. Extremely hard tungsten carbide material is often applied to the surfaces of the teeth by a welding process to improve durability. Tungsten carbide insert (TCI) bits have shaped teeth of sintered tungsten carbide press-fit into drilled holes in the cones. Some types of steel-tooth bits also have TCI elements {{in addition to the}} <b>milled</b> <b>teeth.</b> The cones rotate on roller or journal bearings that are usually sealed from the hostile down-hole drilling fluid environment by different arrangements of o-ring or metal face seals. These bits usually also have pressure compensated grease lubrication systems for the bearings.|$|R
40|$|The elasmobranch fishes are a {{group of}} {{vertebrates}} that have evolved a multi-functional mouth that is involved in mating behavior. Sexually dimorphic changes have been observed, which include epidermal thickening in females and seasonal changes in male dentition. Male Atlantic stingray (Dasyatis sabina) dentition changes from molariform to pointed during the mating season, which allows them to better grasp the females to successfully mate. Pelagic stingrays (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) {{are in the same}} family (Dasyatidae) as Atlantic stingrays and are likely to undergo seasonal changes in dentition as well. However, pelagic stingrays possess pointed symphyseal teeth to aid in feeding on teleosts and squid. Therefore, it is unknown if pelagic stingrays also undergo seasonal changes in dentition to aid in mating. Pelagic stingray jaws were collected from commercial fisherman. Tissue was dissected from each jaw and the number of <b>teeth</b> in the <b>files</b> and rows was recorded. The tooth next to the symphyseal tooth in the second row of the upper jaw was extracted and photographed. Photographs were digitized and analyzed for shape with various software programs. Results show that sexual dimorphism in pelagic stingrays is seen between male and female teeth (P= 0. 01). There {{were no significant differences in}} males and females between mating and non-mating seasons (P= 0. 06, P= 0. 55). The number of tooth rows increased significantly according to disc width in upper jaws in both sexes. The number of tooth rows in the lower jaws of males also increased significantly. There is no significant difference in <b>tooth</b> <b>files</b> in upper or lower jaws in both sexes. However, number of <b>tooth</b> <b>files</b> are significantly different between males and females...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} limestone formation {{as well as the}} performance of different tri-cone bits in limestone in Ewekoro. Rock samples were collected from different layers of limestone encountered in the quarry during drilling operation. These samples were tested in the laboratory for uniaxial compressive strength and the tensile strength. Also, the chemical compositions of the samples were determined using the X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectrometer and the results were used in the determination of the Equivalent Quartz Content (EQC). The length of the insert buttons {{on the surface of the}} drill bits were measured using digital vernier calliper at regular intervals. In addition, the tooth and bearing wear rates as well as the penetration rate were determined on the field. The results of the uniaxial compressive strength varied from 86. 5 MPa (medium strength) to 112 MPa (high strength). The Equivalent Quartz Content (EQC) of the rock samples varied from 17. 37 % to 36. 676 % while the Rock Abrasivity Index (RAI) varied from 15. 03 to 43. 317. The results of the drilling variables showed that higher wear rate was experienced when <b>milled</b> <b>tooth</b> tri-cone bit was used for drilling than using insert tri-cone bit for drilling limestone formation, hence the tri-cone bits performed optimally well in all the formations except in glauconite (GLAB) where its performance was low. However, the economic analysis indicated that the insert tri-cone bit drilling cost per metre varied from N 660 /m to N 673 /m while the <b>milled</b> <b>tooth</b> tri-cone bit drilling cost per metre varied from N 684 /m to N 710 /m. This will act as a data base for selection of drill bits and drilling equipment in limestone quarries...|$|R

50|$|Several factors affect {{drill bit}} selection. Due {{to the high}} number of wells that have been drilled, {{information}} from an adjacent well is most often used to make the appropriate selection. Two different types of drill bits exist: fixed cutter and roller cone. A fixed cutter bit is one where there are no moving parts, but drilling occurs due to shearing, scraping or abrasion of the rock. Fixed cutter bits can be either polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) or grit hotpressed inserts (GHI) or natural diamond. Roller cone bits can be either tungsten carbide inserts (TCI) for harder formations or <b>milled</b> <b>tooth</b> (MT) for softer rock. The manufacturing process and composites used in each type of drill bit make them ideal for specific drilling situations. Additional enhancements can be made to any bit to increase the effectiveness for almost any drilling situation.|$|R

This design represented a significant improvement in drilling performance over the so-called [...] "fish tail" [...] scraper type bits commonly used in rotary drilling at the time, and over the next two decades, rotary drilling with rolling cutter bits largely replaced all other drilling methods in the oilfield. The significance of the Hughes Two-Cone Drill Bit was recognized on its 100th anniversary when it was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.|$|R

40|$|Bush-crickets (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) {{generate}} sound using tegminal stridulation. Signalling {{effectiveness is}} affected by the widely varying acoustic parameters of temporal pattern, frequency and spectral purity (tonality). During stridulation, frequency multiplication occurs as a scraper on one wing scrapes across a <b>file</b> of sclerotized <b>teeth</b> on the other. The frequency with which these toothâ€“scraper interactions occur, along with radiating wing cell resonant properties, dictates both frequency and tonality in the call. Bush-cricket species produce calls ranging from resonant, tonal calls through to non-resonant, broadband signals. The differences are believed to result from differences in <b>file</b> <b>tooth</b> arrangement and wing radiators, but a systematic test of the structural causes of broadband or tonal calls is lacking. Using phylogenetically controlled structural equation models, we show that parameters of <b>file</b> <b>tooth</b> density and <b>file</b> length are the best-fitting predictors of tonality across 40 bush-cricket species. Features of file morphology constrain the production of spectrally pure signals, but systematic distribution of teeth alone does not explain pure-tone sound production in this family...|$|R
