5|$|Tropical Storm Hazel was a weak East Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone that caused heavy damage in Mexico. The costliest storm of the 1965 Pacific hurricane season, it formed from a northward-moving disturbance that originated southeast of Socorro Island. After reaching tropical storm strength on the SaffirSimpson Hurricane Scale, the cyclone {{turned to the}} east-northeast. The storm made landfall near Mazatlán on September 26 and quickly transitioned an extra{{tropical cyclone}}. Although fairly weak, the system was responsible for causing heavy damage to the <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy.</b> Flooding in Mazatlán washed out many houses and submerged others in muddy water. At least six people died with damages totaling $10million (1965 USD) and possibly higher. The name Hazel was retired following this storm, likely due to the Atlantic storm of the same name.|$|E

Most municipalities neither received the necessary financial resources nor the technical assistance to fulfill their new responsibilities.

25|$|The {{collapse}} of the <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy</b> in 1982 hit VAM {{along with all the}} local auto industry. In February 1983, the Mexican government sold its share of VAM to Renault. The new owner was focused more on the Jeep vehicles along with VAM's dealer network and production facilities. Renault reduced production VAM's passenger car line so it would not compete with its own products. The remaining 1983 VAM cars existed mostly to use up the highest possible amount of existing inventories and to fulfill the previous agreements with sourcing companies. The 1983 Rally AMX is almost an exact copy of the 1982 model, specifically {{the second half of the}} model year production. The only differences between both are the presence of a rear ashtray design shared with the Gremlin and American (due to the loss of the console-mounted rear ashtray), a locally produced instrument cluster replacing the imported unit and the chromed squared door mirrors originally used on the Rally SST (minus the still optional controls).

25|$|After the Spanish Invasion and Conquest, European {{techniques}} and designs were introduced, nearly wiping out the native traditions.

Mexico has a number of well-known artisan ceramic traditions, most of which are in the center and south of the country. Examples are the Talavera of Puebla, the majolica of Guanajuato, the various wares of the Guadalajara area, and barro negro of Oaxaca.

2500|$|It has {{now been}} over 160 years since the U.S. took over land {{previously}} controlled by Mexico; however, the U.S. still remains in indirect control of the <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy.</b> Today, by playing such {{a large role in}} the economic factors of its neighboring country, the U.S. continues to show some current attributes of imperialism. Since January 1, 1994, Mexico and the United States (and Canada as well) have eliminated numerous tariffs on imports through the North American Free Trade Agreement. This agreement, despite its benefits for all countries involved, favors the United States. Originally, NAFTA eradicated tariffs on about one-half of U.S. imports from Mexico, and only approximately one-third of Mexican imports from the U.S. [...] After 10 years, NAFTA eliminated all tariffs between the U.S. and Mexico with the exception of some U.S. agricultural exports including grains, meat and some fruits. More recently, the <b>Mexican</b> <b>economy</b> has relied largely upon the U.S. demand for its exports in order to support itself.

40|$|A {{controversial}} {{issue in the}} US is how {{to reduce the number}} of illegal immigrants and what effect this would have on the US economy. To answer this question we set up a two-country model with search in labor markets and featuring legal and illegal immigrants among the low skilled. We calibrate it to the US and <b>Mexican</b> <b>economies</b> during the period 2000 - 2010. As immigrants, especially illegal ones, have a worse outside option than natives their wages are lower. Hence their presence reduces the labor cost of employers who, as a consequence, create more jobs per unemployed when there are more immigrants. Because of such effect our model shows that increasing deportation rates and tightening border control weakens the low-skilled labor markets, increasing unemployment of native low skilled. Legalization, instead decreases the unemployment rate of low-skilled natives and it increases income per native. (Copyright: Elsevier...|$|R

The theoretical analysis demonstrates that in the steady state, low levels of inequality are negatively correlated with high informality; conversely, high inequality exacerbates informality. This finding supports the hypothesis of an optimal level of inequality that minimizes the informal economy relative to the impact of other levels of inequality. However, for ordinary income distributions, changes in the level of inequality have only a slight effect on the informality rate. We calibrate the model using data on the U. S. and <b>Mexican</b> <b>economies</b> to estimate the level of inequality that minimizes the informality rate. The self-employment rate emerges as the most relevant determinant of the informality rate...|$|R
