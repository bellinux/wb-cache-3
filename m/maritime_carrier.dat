40|$|This {{assignment}} {{problem is}} investigated in several steps. First, a myopic deterministic version is studied in which travel time, service {{time and the}} demands are fixed. A new non-decreasing partitioning scheme to deal with time window constraints for this problem is developed. A feasible option for solving the dynamic assignment problem is to repeatedly apply this deterministic algorithm in a dynamic setting in a rolling horizon framework whenever new information is available. The deterministic algorithm provides a basis for further consideration of stochastic factors including queuing times, handling times and travel times under traffic congestion. Several stochastic models are proposed and discussed. The discussion indicates that direct adoption of stochastic models aimed at other problems involves great difficulty because of the complex nature of this problem. Therefore, approximation models are preferable. Further, by incorporating additional requirements of trailer repositioning, a more general problem of multi-layered resource allocation is defined. Multi resource allocation problems have wide practical implications in air, rail and <b>maritime</b> <b>carrier</b> fleet operations. The discussion of these models highlights a promising opportunity for future research. All the methods and ideas motivated by this specific assignment problem can be easily extended to other routing and scheduling problems. As part of this research, we further investigated some NP-hard problems that generally underlie such applications. A special case of TSP problem, titled "the TSP with separation requirement", is examined and a new formulation is presented. The formulation takes the TSP with precedence constraints and the time dependent TSP as special cases. Additionally, a new general cutting plane method is proposed. It applies, but is not limited to, integer programming problem with binary variables. We believe that this method has some advantages over its counterpart, Gomory's method. However, further effort is needed to test its performance...|$|E
40|$|The Atlantic Container Line, being a <b>maritime</b> <b>carrier</b> of goods, {{introduced}} a new transportation document, which needs some explanations and a juridical analysis. The new document consists of two seperate documents: in the port of loading the shipper of the goods receives a freight receipt, in which all particulars concerning the goods and its transport are duly given. The shipper has a choice: instead of such a freight receipt he may ask for a normal bill of lading. But the conditions of carriage are the same both according to the freight receipt as well as according to the bill of lading. There is only one major difference: the bill of lading may be delivered {{to the order of}} the shipper or to the bill of lading holder, whereas the freight receipt must bear the exact name of the consignee. In consequence the freight receipt is not a document which entitles its holder to dispose of the cargo. The freight receipt is delivered to the shipper and remains in his hands. The freight receipt is being drawn up by the carrier or his agent in the port of loading on a telex apparatus, which has a connection with the carrier's agent apparatus at the port of discharge. There, at the same time, a „notice of arrival" is being written by the telex receiver apparatus. This notice of arrival (of the cargo) is being delivered to the consignee, who with that document in hand may take delivery of the cargo. The whole terminology is a new one. Maritime law does not know a freight receipt (it knows merely a mate's receipt which has other functions) nor a notice of arrival of the cargo in form of a document of title. And therefore the legal status of these two documents, considered together as one document of transport, must be found. According to Polish civil law the two mentioned documents together may be identified with a freight bill, a document which is being met with in other branches of the transportation industry. The prefix „telex" should denote that the document is not transferred in its material form (as a piece of paper) but on„wires" with the aid of electronic apparatus. At the port of discharge the document is being drawn up once more. This facilitates enormously maritime trade if and when a bill of lading is not needed. And a bill of lading is not needed when the partners of the selling contract are in constant contact and have a full confidence that the contract will be fulfilled in the agreed manner and time. Such a situation may be found in relations between enterprises of socialist countries. Therefore the maritime telex freight bills could be successfully used in these countries.

40|$|E-services are a {{relatively}} new development in the maritime industry when companies have started to use internet in the contact with the customers. The minimum standard that has developed is to not only give the customer the ability to find the <b>maritime</b> <b>carrier’s</b> schedules online {{but also for the}} customer to be able to track the status of their container using a so called track and trace. These functions are commonly found on a carrier’s own website as well as through online shipping networks. These e-services are linked to the regular customer service that is provided by company’s employees through documentation and booking desks. This study is important as it gives us a deeper understanding of how customers are impacted on by the quality of customer service. This study evaluates the impact of provided services towards the customers by answering the following research questions:  How does the quality of customer service affect the shippers’ choice of carrier?  How would the configuration of e-services affect the customer’s choice of shipping carrier?  What should be considered in the carrier’s establishment of an e-strategy to reach the customers’ expectations of e-services? The study was performed using qualitative interviews with customers within the shipping business. The results of the study show that the quality of customer service has an impact on the choice of carrier but also on further business agreements. It is important for the customer to get a high level of service with emphasis on time of response, availability and correct information. The study has also shown that customers value the attitude of the <b>maritime</b> <b>carrier’s</b> customer service employees as it affects the relationship.

30|$|Structural optimization, {{especially}} topology optimization, {{is being}} used increasingly in aerospace vehicles, <b>maritime</b> <b>carriers,</b> wind turbine blades, and various mechanical equipment where high strength, high stiffness, and low weight are important. In such applications, the problem of selecting a suitable optimization model has been investigated for a long time. In the vast literature on structural optimization model, arguably the two most studied problems are stress-constrained weight minimization and material volume-constrained compliance minimization. Indeed, Cox (1965) succeeded to prove that results attained via compliance minimization model would be equivalent to Michell's truss (stress-constrained weight minimization result) in 1965.It has been shown {{a long time ago}} that these seemingly different problems possess equal optimal topologies (result), when the truss is subject to a single loading condition and the allowable stresses in tension and compression are equal (Dorn et al. 1964; Hemp 1973).

The main argument provided by companies is that this process is done to gain economies of scale and operational synergies. In order to test this argument an average cost function that depends on the number of operators in the industry, thus if there are strategic agreements or not among carriers, has been estimated and it has been found to decrease when strategic alliances are established. This means a better situation in terms of efficiency due to the concentration of the sector but it does not mean lower prices or an increase in the general level of welfare.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the competition among ports. In particular we study the relation between port characteristics and port market share of <b>maritime</b> traffic. <b>Maritime</b> <b>carriers</b> make two primary decisions that affect ports. In the long-term, they assign vessels to routes. In the short-term, they assign each shipment to a vessel and, with that vessel, a port. In this research, we assume that vessel schedules are fixed and model the assignment of shipments {{as a function of the}} attributes that describe each port. For a carrier, some assignments are simpler than other assignments. Each assignment should, however, take into account the same criteria. We begin by examining the scheduling of vessels for its effect on the assignment of shipments. We measure the impact of being a vessel's first or last port of call on a port's market share, and we discuss factors that might influence these schedules. We then examine the assignment to ports for exports of various commodity types as a function of geographic location (oceanic and inland distances), port characteristics (vessel capacity and port charges), and characteristics of vessel schedules (frequency and the order ofvisits). We use a multinomial choice model to analyze port choice. We find that the most significant factors are the geographic factors, which are beyond port control. The factors that ports can influence directly appear to be of far less significance. We also find that the choice processes vary with commodity type as well as carrier. The decisions are also found to differ between local and discretionary cargo. Our findings could affect decisions made by port managers as well as carriers or shippers. With the recognition of geographic advantages, port managers could focus marketing more effectively. Recognizing the impact of each carrier's schedules, they could suggest changes to carriers presently visiting the port or recruit new carriers to use present facilities more efficiently. Port managers could also evaluate more effectively investments designed to increase market share. Facilities or technologies could be incremented with a more accurate vision of future traffic levels at individual ports. ...|$|R
40|$|The current paper {{deals with}} a special case of the Network Design Problem (NDP) that arises when {{multiple}} authorities are controlling certain parts of a network and in particular when these are engaged into a deliberative environment, forming a competitive market for transportation services. This alteration departs significantly from the classical paradigm of the NDP extending the classical single leader-multiple followers Stackelberg game-theoretic formulation to its complete form of multiple leadersmultiple followers Competitive NDP (CNDP). In order to address the particular problem setup, a multilevel vector-optimization programming problem is formulated, which is tackled by a proposed novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) -based decentralized evolutionary optimization algorithm. The application of this framework is done over a freight network that is composed of multiple transportation means, and in particular over a complete transportation chain formed by shippers, <b>maritime</b> and land <b>carriers</b> and port authorities, where the latter are competing for profits. The market of maritime facilities is modeled as an nperson non-cooperative game among port authorities who control the attractiveness of their terminal facilities. By taking the above interdependencies into consideration, the estimation of the equilibrium point of the above formulation is made by creating a game-theoretic platform where Intelligent Agents (corresponding to port authorities) are evolving their strategies towards equilibrium points. Results from {{the application of the}} proposed framework into a realistic part of the East Mediterranean freight network are provided and discussed. © 2009 IFAC...|$|R
40|$|Maritime cargo was {{traditionally}} {{delivered to}} the waterfront. placed aboard ship by crane, and stowed item by item in a ship's hold by hand, a process which had been dependent on manual labor {{for as long as}} ships had carried cargo. In the 1960 s this system was threatened by the introduction of a process which packaged cargo into large steel containers at its place or origin, transported the loaded containers by specially designed trucks, trains, and ships, and delivered them to their destination without the items or cargo being touched by human hands. This new, mechanized system threatened the jobs of longshoremen on the docks, and required maritime carr!ers and port managers to accommodate to its special needs. This history describes the manner in which these groups struggled to create a policy to meet the challenges presented by the introduction or containerization into the California maritime industry. The International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union faced the threat posed by this new labor replacing technology, by abandoning its traditional opposition to mechanization and accepting the new technology on the waterfront. In the traditionally conservative <b>maritime</b> industry, most <b>carriers</b> either gave short shrift to containerization, or tried to superimpose it onto the existing cargo transportation methods, thus failing to realize the full benefits of the new technology. The Matson Navigation Company, however, after analyzing the new system with operations research methodology, made the full commitment containerization required. and became the pathfinder for the new technology in the California mari­time cargo transportation industry. The Port of San Francisco, however. did not make a full commitment to con­tainerization and failed to reap the benefits which it brought to other state and national ports. In Its efforts to meet the challenges posed by the new technology, the port was burdened with the heritage of an outdated system of state ownership with its tradition of conservative management. When port administrators attempted to create a policy to meet the challenges posed by this new cargo transportation system. there was disagreement and public outcry not only over the means to accomplish that goal, but also over the definition of the goal. More than a quarter or a century after Matson's first container ship sailed under the Golden Gate, the Port or San Francisco still struggles to create a viable policy {{to meet the demands of}} this now universally accepted maritime technology...|$|R
40|$|When {{goods are}} sold internationally, {{it is common}} that the seller {{receives}} the purchase price against documents. In many cases, the buyer {{does not have a}} chance to examine the goods before the seller obtains payment. Therefore, the buyer must rely on the accuracy of the information contained in the documents. The objective of the thesis is to discuss the risks that are related to the purchase price being paid against the documents. Furthermore, the thesis analyses what additional roles documents play in the contract of sale and contracts supplementing it. The main focus is on the bill of lading, which is a sea transportation document issued by the carrier, because it enables, for example, the goods to be sold during transit. A documentary credit is a commonly used method of payment. In order for the seller to obtain the purchase price, the seller must deliver conforming documents to the bank. This creates a documentary risk, meaning that there is a risk that documents provided by the seller might not be in accordance with the terms of the letter of credit. If this happens the bank must refuse payment. From the buyer’s perspective, there is a risk that the documents do not communicate accurately the status of the goods on loading. The description of the goods in the bill of lading is subject to the carrier’s obligation to check the quantity, quality, and condition of the goods. In practice, the carrier’s obligation to check is limited in particular when goods are containerised. Therefore, the information cannot be entirely reliable. Moreover, the carrier is not able to assess whether the goods are in accordance with the contract of sale because he is not an expert surveyor and not aware of the terms of the sale contract. According to the Finnish <b>Maritime</b> Code, the <b>carrier</b> is liable for inaccurate information in some situations which enhances the transferability of the document. The research illustrates that the system seeks to ensure that the documents are accurate. However, is not without gaps and thus, there is a risk that the seller obtains the payment even when the goods are not in accordance with the agreement between the seller and the buyer. Moreover, the system has not been constructed in a way which would easily detect the seller’s fraud. This is because the banks that examine the documents supplied by the seller adopt a formalistic approach which does not seek to assess the actual condition of the goods, rather {{it is based on the}} assumption that their description is sufficient. The bill of lading is also a tool needed in the delivery of the goods. Goods might arrive before the documents which certainly increases the likeliness of the carrier delivering the goods to the wrong party without complying with the rules on delivery as stipulated in the Finnish Maritime Code. The industry has developed arrangements to mitigate the risks related to delivery without a bill of lading which shows that the document is not able to meet the needs of today’s trade...|$|R
