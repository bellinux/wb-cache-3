5000|$|After The Spirit, {{perhaps the}} best drawn feature in the section was Powell's <b>Mr.</b> Mystic. <b>Eisner</b> created <b>Mr.</b> Mystic by {{retooling}} his Yarko the Great, which had been syndicated overseas. After running through Eisner's scripts, Powell wrote and drew the feature until he was drafted {{a couple of years}} later.

50|$|The first Jewish {{hospital}} in Philadelphia originated in {{a suggestion of}} Abraham Sulzberger, who insisted in 1864 that a hospital was an urgent necessity {{in the community and}} that steps should be taken at once to secure the funds necessary to establish one. The first officers were Alfred T. Jones (president), Isidore Binswanger (vice-president), Samuel Weil (treasurer), Mayer Sulzberger (secretary), Henry J. Hunt (corresponding secretary). The association was incorporated September 23, 1865. The first site of the hospital was at Fifty-sixth street and Haverford road. Within a decade the needs of the first hospital had outgrown its accommodations, and in 1873, during the presidency of Abraham S. Wolf, it removed to Old York road. In 1901 Meyer Guggenheim presented to the association $80,000 (today $) for the purpose of erecting a private auxiliary hospital. <b>Mrs.</b> Sarah <b>Eisner</b> has recently built a Home for Nurses. Among other buildings on the hospital grounds are the Home for Aged and Infirm Israelites, the Loeb Operating Building, the M. A. Loeb Dispensary, and the Lucien Moss Home for Incurables. The Jewish Hospital is one of the best-equipped and best-managed institutions in the United States. William B. Hackenburg succeeded Abraham S. Wolf as president in 1878, and has served in that capacity ever since. To them is due, in a great measure, the success of the hospital. The Jewish Maternity Association was founded November 3, 1873. In addition to the maternity hospital there is a training-school for nurses, of which Mrs. S. Belle Cohn is president.|$|R
