2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} the accident was an Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia (registration number N270AS), manufactured on November 30, 1990. It was equipped with two Pratt & Whitney PW-118 engines and Hamilton Standard 14RF-9 propellers. The airplane received its U.S. standard airworthiness certificate on December 20, 1990. The aircraft had accumulated about 1,000 flying hours prior to the accident. Only one deferred <b>maintenance</b> <b>item</b> was noted in the maintenance logs. This was for fuel leaking from the auxiliary power unit cowling. The circuit breaker for the APU had been pulled while spare parts could {{be made available to}} fix the cowling. [...] Because they were not required at the time, the aircraft did not have a Cockpit Voice Recorder or Flight Data Recorder.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} File Stores {{had four}} hard drives each. These hard drives were large, fast, expensive and crude, weighing {{about a hundred}} pounds (40 kg) with 128 tracks and one head per track as in a drum memory. They contained backups for software and for fixed data (translations) but were not used in call processing. These file stores, a high <b>maintenance</b> <b>item</b> with pneumatic valves and other mechanical parts, were replaced in the 1980s with the 1A Attached Processor System (1AAPS) using the 3B20D Computer {{to provide access to}} the [...] "1A File Store".

5000|$|The first-generation Hydramatic (not the {{controlled}} coupling version that succeeded it in 1956) {{did not have}} a separate park position as found in modern automatic transmissions. The driver had to shut off the engine and then place the transmission in reverse in order to lock the driveline to prevent the car from moving. Also, the original Hydramatic required periodic band adjustments as a routine <b>maintenance</b> <b>item</b> that later versions did not. Early 1940 model Oldsmobiles with Hydra-Matic Drive could be started with the transmission selector lever in any position. The car would then start to move, unless the transmission lever had been left in N, neutral.|$|E
50|$|Another {{variation}} is with flexible (layflat) tubing where the archimedean spiral {{acts as a}} peristaltic pump, which operates on much the same principle as a toothpaste tube. They have casings filled with lubricant to prevent abrasion of {{the exterior of the}} pump tube and to aid in the dissipation of heat, and use reinforced tubes, often called 'hoses'. This class of pump is often called a 'hose pumper'. Since there are no moving parts in contact with the fluid, peristaltic pumps are inexpensive to manufacture. Their lack of valves, seals and glands makes them comparatively inexpensive to maintain, and the hose or tube is a low-cost <b>maintenance</b> <b>item</b> compared to other pump types.|$|E

40|$|The general {{practice}} teaching {{clinic at the}} Chinese University of Hong Kong uses a microcomputerbased medical record system. To implement a uniform and up-to-date health maintenance programme, a set of protocols has been written {{for a list of}} health <b>maintenance</b> <b>items,</b> and the computer has been programmed to identify the items which should be carried out at each patient encounter. Over a period of 16 months, after the start of this programme, 99 % of the 1120 clinic patients had a minimum of two items performed. Of a selected sample of 203 patients 119 attended the clinic more than once in the same period and 47 % of these patients had all of the health <b>maintenance</b> <b>items</b> recommended for their age and sex group completed. Abnormal screening results led to action by the {{general practice}} team.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of high-speed railway in China, {{the problem of}} motor train set assignment and maintenance scheduling {{is becoming more and}} more important for transportation organization. This paper focuses on considering the special <b>maintenance</b> <b>items</b> of motor train set and mainly meets the two maintenance cycle limits on aspects of mileage and time for each item. And then, a 0 - 1 integer programming model for motor train set assignment and maintenance scheduling is proposed, which aims at maximizing the accumulated mileage before each maintenance and minimizing the number of motor train sets. Restrictions of the model include the matching relation between motor train sets and routes as well as that between motor train sets and <b>maintenance</b> <b>items</b> and <b>maintenance</b> capacity of motor train set depot. A heuristic solution strategy based on particle swarm optimization is also proposed to solve the model. In the end, a case study is designed based on the background of Beijing south depot in China, and the result indicates that the model and algorithm proposed in this paper could solve the problem of motor train set assignment and maintenance scheduling effectively...|$|R
5000|$|All roofs {{should be}} {{inspected}} semi-annually and after major storms. Particular {{attention should be}} paid to the flashings around all of the rooftop penetrations. The sharp bends at such places can open up and need to be sealed with plastic cement, mesh and a small mason's trowel. Additionally, repairs to lap seams in the base flashings should be made. 90% of all roof leaks and failure occur at the flashings. Another important <b>maintenance</b> <b>item,</b> often neglected, is to simply keep the roof drains free of debris. A clogged roof drain will cause water to pond, leading to increased [...] "dead load" [...] weight on building that may not be engineered to accommodate that weight. Additionally, ponding water on a roof can freeze. Often, water finds its way into a flashing seam and freezes, weakening the seam.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967 {{responsibility}} for {{the operation of the}} Commonwealth Institute was transferred to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs, and then in 1968 to the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (FCO). Various problems with the building had come to light since its completion, and in 1982 a total cost estimate of £312,000 was reported for recommended maintenance work, with the most important structural <b>maintenance</b> <b>item</b> being the waterproofing of the roof. Some work was approved, but the roof continued to leak, and by 1988 it was reported to the FCO that £700,000 was needed for the building to be structurally safe, with internal and essential modernisations being [...] "likely to cost £5m". Later that year the building was given a Grade II* listing with associated restrictions on any building works or development possibilities. In 1989 a further estimate of £10m was given for more extensive refurbishment. With a background of high maintenance costs, the activities continued, but with an increasing emphasis on revenue generation, and various proposals were explored for commercial development of the site.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} railway {{sleepers}} must account for irregularities {{of the train}} or the rails that generate dynamic loads. The sleepers could develop cracks during a train passage although not influential enough to disturb immediately the global track system. However, these cracks can {{pose a threat to}} the overall stiffness properties as they can propagate further under repeated loads induced by the train. Consequently they can cause fatigue, which is a structural failure at service condition. This will later constitute a major <b>maintenance</b> <b>item</b> if the problem is not properly addressed. It is intended that the application of highstrength concrete (HSC) with the inclusion of fibres in railway sleepers could reduce, delay or in certain conditions arrest the rate of crack growth. The design of sleeper was proven to comply in partial of the referenced Standards requirements. The fabrication works undertaken also proved that all procedures were followed satisfactorily and that the laboratory of the Faculty of Civil Engineering was able to handle the production. Structural tests carried out where loads were applied at rail seat showed that behaviour of HSFC sleepers had high flexural strength capacities due to the presence of fibres...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This article aims {{to provide}} {{details of the}} process {{involved}} in preparing a comprehensive maintenance audit of school buildings and facilities in a state government education department. Design/methodology/approach – This paper presents the framework and logistics of the survey or audit, which relied on integrating a property management system with a consistent approach {{to the definition of}} maintenance and its costing. The use of visual illustrations of maintenance categories is a feature of the process and this study. Findings – The work was completed in three months and drew upon the department’s two computerized property management and asset systems, the physical resource management system (PRMS) and the school asset management system (SAMS). The department adopted an IT-basedapproach that integrated the building element-based <b>maintenance</b> <b>items</b> with electronic plans and a standard costing approach using hand-held pen-activated computers {{under the control of the}} maintenance auditors. The process of conducting the maintenance audit has resulted in the mostcomprehensive review and updating of all the maintenance requirements in school buildings. It has provided real and accurate costing of this work on a fair, methodical and consistent basis. The size of the final costs in each maintenance category has allowed funding to be refined, targeted and focused on many key and important areas. Research limitations/implications – Whilst categories of different maintenance work are provided in broad terms, for confidentiality reasons the client organization would not permit the financial values of these categories to be published. Practical implications – Examples of the categorization and analysis of <b>maintenance</b> <b>items</b> are included to illustrate and demonstrate the method of approach. Details of the extensive auditing process described provide insights for any large organization with widespread facilities and property assets to adopt a similar approach. Originality/value – The process is an exemplar for an integrated property management and maintenance auditing system using IT and the practical skills of maintenance inspectors...|$|R
