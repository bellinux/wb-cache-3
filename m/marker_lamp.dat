Instead of the dual-reflector headlamps, a single-reflector design was used inboard of an amber combination turn signal, parking, and side <b>marker</b> <b>lamp</b> and reflector wrapping around the corner, and fog lamps smaller than the rest-of-world items were placed the corners of the bumper air duct.|$|E
5000|$|Aside from a longer, 5 year/50,000 mile warranty, Eldorado {{received}} {{very few}} changes for 1987. A price drop, to $23,740, {{did not raise}} sales any, as only 17,775 were made this year (21,342 for 1986). The standard suspension, with new taller 75 series (previously 70) tires and hydro-elastic engine mounts, was slightly retuned for a softer ride, while the optional ($155) Touring Suspension, with deflected-disc strut valves and 15" [...] alloy wheels, remained for those desiring a firmer ride. As part of a federal requirement to discourage [...] "chop-shop" [...] thieves, major body panels were etched with the VIN. Also new, a combination cashmere cloth with leather upholstery, and locking inertia seat belt reels for rear seat passengers, which allowed for child-seat installation in the outboard seating positions in back. The formal cabriolet roof was added this year. Available for $495 on the base Eldorado, it featured a padded covering over the rear half of the roof, and turned the rear side glass into smaller opera windows. One of Eldorado's most expensive singluar options was the Motorola cellular telephone mounted inside the locking center arm rest. Priced at $2,850, it had been reworked this year for easier operation, and featured a hidden microphone mounted between the sun visors for hands-free operation. Additionally, the telephone featured a clever radio mute control: activated when the telephone and radio were in use at the same time, it automatically decreased the rear speaker's audio volume, and over-rode the front music speakers {{to be used for}} the hands-free telephone. On an interesting note, the square <b>marker</b> <b>lamp,</b> located on the bumper extension molding just behind the rear wheel well on 1986 and '87 Eldorado models, would suddenly re-appear on the 1990 & '91 Seville (base models only) and Eldorado Touring Coupé.|$|E

Herein, we report the preparation of rod-shaped layer-by-layer (LbL) -assembled polymer hydrogel capsules with tunable aspect ratios (ARs). By templating spherical and rodlike silica particles, disulfide-stabilized poly(methacrylic acid) hydrogel capsules (PMA HCs) with different ARs (from 1 to 4) are generated. The influence of capsule AR on cellular internalization and intracellular fate was quantitatively investigated by flow cytometry, imaging flow cytometry, and fluorescence deconvolution microscopy. These experiments reveal that the cellular internalization kinetics of PMA HCs are dependent on the AR, with spherical capsules being internalized more rapidly and {{to a greater extent}} compared with rod-shaped capsules. In contrast, the capsules with different ARs are colocalized with the lysosomal <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1, suggesting that the lysosomal compartmentalization is independent of shape for these soft polymer capsules.

40|$|It {{is hard to}} find an area {{of biology}} in which {{autophagy}} is not involved. In fact, the topic extends beyond scientific research to stimulate intellectual exercise and entertainment-autophagy has found its way into a crossword puzzle (Klionsky, 2013). We have found yet another function of autophagy while searching for a better treatment for Pompe disease, a devastating metabolic myopathy resulting from excessive lysosomal glycogen storage. To relieve this glycogen burden, we stimulated lysosomal exocytosis through upregulation of transcription factor EB (TFEB). Overexpression of TFEB in Pompe muscle clears the cells of enlarged lysosomes, reduces glycogen levels, and alleviates autophagic buildup, the major secondary abnormality in Pompe disease. Unexpectedly, the process of exocytosis {{does not seem to be}} a purely lysosomal event; vesicles arranged along the plasma membrane are double-labeled with the lysosomal <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1 and the autophagosomal marker LC 3, indicating that TFEB induces the exocytosis of autolysosomes.

40|$|TLR 9 is a {{receptor}} for oligodeoxynucleotides {{that contain}} unmethylated CpG motifs (CpG). Because TLR 9 {{resides in the}} endoplasmic reticulum during the quiescence state, CpG binding to TLR 9 requires membrane trafficking, which includes the maturation of the CpG-containing endosome. In the present study, we examined the role of PIKfyve, a phosphatidylinositol 3 -phosphate 5 -kinase, in the regulation of TLR 9 signaling. The PIKfyve inhibitor YM 201636 inhibited co-localization of the CpG-containing endosome with LysoTracker, which stains acidic organelle, and with TLR 9. YM 201636 increased the co-localization of CpG with the early endosome marker EEA 1 but decreased co-localization with the late endosome <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1. Similar results were obtained in Raw 264. 7 cells containing shRNA that targets PIKfyve. CpG-mediated phosphorylation but not lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -mediated phosphorylation of IKK, p 38 MAPK, JNK and Stat 3 was severely impaired {{by the loss of}} PIKfyve function. CpG-mediated expression of cytokine mRNA was also decreased in the absence of PIKfyve. These findings demonstrate a novel role of PIKfyve in TLR 9 signaling...|$|E

Most of the information available on B. ovis and host cell interaction has been generated using murine macrophages or epithelial cell lines, but the interaction between B. ovis and primary ovine macrophages has not been studied. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the role of the B. ovis abcEDCBA-encoded ABC transporter and the virB operon-encoded Type IV Secretion System (T 4 SS) during intracellular survival of B. ovis in ovine peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages. ΔabcBA and ΔvirB 2 mutant strains were unable to survive in the intracellular environment when compared to the WT B. ovis at 48 hours post infection (hpi). In addition, these mutant strains cannot exclude the lysosomal <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1 from its vacuolar membrane, and their vacuoles do not acquire the endoplasmic reticulum marker calreticulin, which takes place in the WT B. ovis containing vacuole.

40|$|Although Bordetella {{pertussis}} {{has been}} observed to survive inside macrophages, its ability to resist or evade degradation in phagolysosomes has not been defined. We here investigated the trafficking of B. pertussis upon entry into human macrophages. During the first hours following phagocytosis, {{a high percentage of}} bacteria were destroyed within acidic compartments positive for the lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMP). However, roughly one-fourth of the bacteria taken up evade this initial killing event, remaining in nonacidic compartments. Forty-eight hours after infection, the number of intracellular bacteria per cell increased, suggesting that B. pertussis is capable of replicating in this type of compartment. Viable bacteria accumulated within phagosomal compartments positive for the early endosomal marker Rab 5 but not the late endosomal <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP.</b> Moreover, B. pertussis-containing phagosomes acquired exogenously added transferrin, indi-cating that intracellular bacteria have access to extracellular components and essential nutrients via the host cell recycling pathway. Overall, these results suggest that B. pertussis survives and eventually replicates in compartments with characteristics of early endosomes, potentially contributing to its extraordinary ability to persist within hosts and populations.

40|$|Huntington’s disease (HD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{characterized by}} progressive motor, cognitive and psychiatric deficits, associated with predominant loss of striatal neurons and is caused by polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein. Mutant huntingtin protein and its fragments are resistant to protein degradation and produce a blockade of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). In HD models, the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin aggravates protein accumulation and the inductor of autophagy, trehalose, diminishes it. We have investigated the effects of epoxomicin and trehalose in skin fibroblasts of control and HD patients. Untreated HD fibroblasts have increased the levels of ubiquitinized proteins {{and higher levels of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS), huntingtin and the autophagy <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 2 A. Baseline replication rates were higher in HD than in controls fibroblasts but that was reverted after 12 passages. Epoxomicin increases the activated caspase- 3, HSP 70, huntingtin, ubiquitinated proteins and ROS levels in both HD and controls. Treatment with trehalose counteracts the increase in ROS, ubiquitinated proteins, huntingtin and activated caspase- 3 levels induced by epoxomicin, and also increases the LC 3 levels more in HD fibroblast than controls.

40|$|This {{field study}} {{investigated}} the efficiency of color coding for peripheral identification of vehicle signals. Specifically, the study dealt with identification of stimuli as “yellow” or “red” when presented at intensities corresponding to typical turn signal <b>lamps</b> and side <b>marker</b> <b>lamps.</b> Turn signal lamps were studied both during bright, sunny conditions and at night, while side <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> were studied at night only. We used two different yellow stimuli and two different red stimuli. For each color category, one stimulus was relatively far from the contrasting color category while the other stimulus was relatively near. Four viewing angles were used: 0, 10, 20, and 30 degrees from visual fixation. A total of 28 subjects participated, ranging from 21 to 78 years old. Nighttime identification of colors was perfect at all viewing angles for stimuli representing turn signal lamps. On the other hand, there were strong effects of viewing angle for turn signals in the daytime and for side <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> at night. Although in these two conditions performance deteriorated for stimuli in both color categories, it did so more for the red stimuli. This {{finding is consistent with}} the previously reported finding that peripherally presented red stimuli often appear yellow. The present findings imply that coding signals yellow and red is not sufficient for their peripheral identification under the two most difficult conditions tested (turn signals during bright daytime and side <b>marker</b> <b>lamps</b> during nighttime). To the extent that peripheral discriminability is important in actual driving, efficient signaling should rely on other coding parameters (e. g., intensity, and flashing versus steady burning) ...|$|R

40|$|The innate {{immune system}} elicits {{the first wave of}} immune {{responses}} against pathogen infection. Its operational modes are complex and have yet to be defined. Here, we report the identification of an innate immune regulator termed TAPE (TBK 1 -associated protein in endolysosomes), previously known as CC 2 D 1 A/Freud- 1 /Aki- 1, which modulates the TLR 3 and TLR 4 pathways. We found that TAPE activated the TBK 1, NF-κB, and ERK pathways leading to IFN-β and inflammatory cytokine induction. TAPE was shown to colocalize with endosomal marker Rab 5 and lysosomal <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1 in mammalian cells, suggesting that TAPE resided in endolysosomes. Knockdown of TAPE selectively impaired the TLR 3 and endocytic TLR 4 pathways to IFN-β induction. Furthermore, TAPE interacted and synergized with Trif to activate IFN-β. TAPE knockdown failed to block Trif-mediated IFN-β induction, whereas Trif knockdown impaired the TLR 3 and TAPE cooperation on IFN-β induction, suggesting that TAPE acts upstream of Trif. Together, our data demonstrate a central role for TAPE in linking TLR 3 and TLR 4 to innate immune defenses at an early step...|$|E

Six to eight hours after ingestion of dead bacteria, degraded bacterial particles were observed in the cytoplasm and in vesicles positive for cathepsin D. These results indicate that live B.

40|$|Yersinia pestis is a facultative {{intracellular}} pathogen {{that causes}} the disease known as plague. During infection of macrophages Y. pestis actively evades the normal phagosomal maturation pathway to establish a replicative niche within the cell. However, the mecha-nisms used by Y. pestis to subvert killing by the macrophage are unknown. Host Rab GTPases are central mediators of vesicular trafficking and are commonly targeted by bacte-rial pathogens to alter phagosome maturation and killing by macrophages. Here we demon-strate {{for the first time}} that host Rab 1 b is required for Y. pestis to effectively evade killing by macrophages. We also show that Rab 1 b is specifically recruited to the Yersinia containing vacuole (YCV) and that Y. pestis is unable to subvert YCV acidification when Rab 1 b expres-sion is knocked down in macrophages. Furthermore, Rab 1 b knockdown also altered the fre-quency of association between the YCV with the lysosomal <b>marker</b> <b>Lamp</b> 1, suggesting that Rab 1 b recruitment to the YCV directly inhibits phagosome maturation.

40|$|AbstractGTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH), an {{oligomeric}} protein {{composed of}} 10 identical subunits, {{is required for}} the synthesis of neurotransmitters; mutations in GCH are associated with dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) and hyperphenylalaninemia. Mutated GCH proteins are unstable and prone to dominant-negative effect. We show herein that expression of the GCH mutant GCH- 201 E or the splicing variant GCH-II caused intracellular inclusion bodies. When Hsp 27 was expressed together with the GCH mutants, Hsp 27 expression decreased the formation of inclusion bodies by GCH (as assessed by immunofluorescence) and decreased the amount of insoluble GCH mutant proteins (as assessed by Western blot). Transfection of pcDNA-Hsp 27 -S 3 D, a phosphorylation-mimicry Hsp 27 mutant, was more effective at the mutated GCH proteins than transfection with pcDNA-Hsp 27, but okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, enhanced the effect of pcDNA-Hsp 27. Hsp 27 -S 3 D also abolished the dominant-negative action of GCH-II. The mutated GCH proteins interacted with the wild-type GCH protein; the inclusion bodies were positive for lysosomal <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1, soluble in 2 % SDS, and were not ubiquitinated. Phophorlyated Hsp 27 also decreased the inclusion body formation by the huntingtin polyglutamines.

40|$|Abstract Pompe {{disease is}} a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder (LSD) caused by mutations in the gene that encodes acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Recently, small molecule pharmacological chaperones {{have been shown to}} increase protein stability and cellular levels for mutant lysosomal enzymes and have emerged as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of LSDs. In this study, we characterized the pharmacological chaperone 1 -deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) on 76 different mutant forms of GAA identified in Pompe disease. DNJ significantly increased enzyme activity and protein levels for 16 different GAA mutants in patient-derived fibroblasts and in transiently transfected COS- 7 cells. Additionally, DNJ increased the processing of these GAA mutants to their mature lysosomal forms, suggesting facilitated trafficking through the secretory pathway. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies showed increased colocalization of GAA with the lysosomal <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 2 after incubation with DNJ, confirming increased lysosomal trafficking. Lastly, a GAA structural model was constructed based on the related eukaryotic glucosidase maltase-glucoamylase. The mutated residues identified in responsive forms of GAA are located throughout most of the structural domains, with half of these residues located in two short regions within the catalytic domain. Taken together, these data support further evaluation of DNJ as a potential treatment for Pompe disease in patients that express responsive forms of GAA...|$|E

The molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are still poorly understood. To identify new bacterial factors involved in these processes, a library of 1800 Brucella melitensis 16 M mini-Tn 5 catkm mutants was screened for intracellular survival and multiplication in HeLa cells and J 774 A. 1 macrophages. Thirteen mutants were identified as defective for their intracellular survival in both cell types.

The pathways underlying the removal of dead cells in homeostatic apoptosis have been extensively studied, but little is known regarding how cells that undergo apoptotic death during mycobacterial infection are removed. This study shows that macrophages induced to undergo apoptosis with mycobacteria cell wall proteins are engulfed by J- 774 A. 1 monocytic cells through the mannose receptor. This demonstration was achieved through assays in which phagocytosis was inhibited with a blocking anti-mannose receptor antibody and with mannose receptor competitor sugars. Moreover, elimination of the mannose receptor by a specific siRNA significantly diminished {{the expression of the}} mannose receptor and the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. As shown by immunofluorescence, engulfed apoptotic bodies are initially located in Rab 5 -positive phagosomes, which mature to express the phagolysosome <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1.

40|$|Abstract Background Epidermal {{growth factor}} {{receptor}} (EGFR) controls {{a wide range}} of cellular processes, and altered EGFR signaling contributes to human cancer. EGFR kinase domain mutants found in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are constitutively active, a trait critical for cell transformation through activation of downstream pathways. Endocytic trafficking of EGFR is a major regulatory mechanism as ligand-induced lysosomal degradation results in termination of signaling. While numerous studies have examined mutant EGFR signaling, the endocytic traffic of mutant EGFR within the NSCLC milieu remains less clear. Results This study shows that mutant EGFRs in NSCLC cell lines are constitutively endocytosed as shown by their colocalization with the early/recycling endosomal marker transferrin and the late endosomal/lysosomal <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1. Notably, mutant EGFRs, but not the wild-type EGFR, show a perinuclear accumulation and colocalization with recycling endosomal markers such as Rab 11 and EHD 1 upon treatment of cells with endocytic recycling inhibitor monensin, suggesting that mutant EGFRs preferentially traffic through the endocytic recycling compartments. Importantly, monensin treatment enhanced the mutant EGFR association and colocalization with Src, indicating that aberrant transit through the endocytic recycling compartment promotes mutant EGFR-Src association. Conclusion The findings presented in this study show that mutant EGFRs undergo aberrant traffic into the endocytic recycling compartment which allows mutant EGFRs to engage in a preferential interaction with Src, a critical partner for EGFR-mediated oncogenesis. </p...|$|E

Previous work showed that a B. ovis mutant lacking a species-specific ABC transporter (ΔabcBA) was attenuated in mice and was unable to survive in macrophages. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of this ABC transporter during intracellular survival of B. ovis. In HeLa cells, B. ovis WT was able to survive and replicate at later time point (48 hpi), whereas an ΔabcBA mutant was attenuated at 24 hpi. The reduced survival of the ΔabcBA mutant was associated with a decreased ability to exclude the lysosomal <b>marker</b> <b>LAMP</b> 1 from its vacuolar membrane, suggesting a failure to establish a replicative niche. The ΔabcBA mutant showed a reduced abundance of the Type IV secretion system (T 4 SS) proteins VirB 8 and VirB 11 in both rich and acid media, when compared to WT B. ovis. However, mRNA levels of virB 1, virB 8, hutC, and vjbR were similar in both strains.
