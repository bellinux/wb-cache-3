5|$|Wizard did not {{reappear}} as {{a four-year-old}} until October, when he defeated Derby winner Pope over {{one and a}} quarter <b>miles</b> <b>at</b> Newmarket. Pope had started the race as the 1/2 favourite. The following day, Wizard walked over for one-third of a subscription of 25 guineas each. These were his only two appearances in 1810.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, {{he participated}} in Operation Mount Hope III, during which U.S. forces {{recovered}} a crashed Soviet-made Mi-24 Hind attack helicopter in Chad. Company E of the 160th deployed to N'Djamena, Chad via C-5 Galaxy. Once in Chad the company flew two CH-47 Chinooks 490 nautical <b>miles</b> <b>at</b> night, {{without the use of}} navigational aids, to the crash site. Once at the crash site the crews harnessed the crashed Hind to a Chinook via sling-load. During the returning flight both Chinooks performed an air-to-air refuel with a C-130; and later endured a sandstorm before returning with the Hind.|$|E
5|$|Several governments {{maintain}} permanent manned research stations on the continent. The {{number of}} people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent and its nearby islands varies from about 1,000 in winter to about 5,000 in the summer, giving it a population density between 70 and 350 inhabitants per million square kilometres (180 and 900 per million square <b>miles)</b> <b>at</b> these times. Many of the stations are staffed year-round, the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment. An Orthodox church—Trinity Church, opened in 2004 at the Russian Bellingshausen Station—is manned year-round by one or two priests, who are similarly rotated every year.|$|E
50|$|Rupp, a Silver Olympic Medalist, {{set a new}} American {{record in}} the 5000-meter race hitting 13 minutes 1 second at the Boston University Multi-Team Meet. He {{negative}} split the race with: his first <b>mile</b> <b>at</b> 4 minutes and 14 seconds, the second <b>mile</b> <b>at</b> 4 minutes and 12 seconds, the third <b>mile</b> <b>at</b> 4 minutes and 4 seconds leaving his last 200-meters in 30 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|Mile run {{contests}} {{remain a}} key feature of many annual {{track and field}} meetings, with long-running series such as the Wanamaker <b>Mile</b> <b>at</b> the Millrose Games, Dream <b>Mile</b> <b>at</b> the Bislett Games, the British Emsley Carr Mile, and the Bowerman <b>Mile</b> <b>at</b> the Prefontaine Classic being among the most prominent. Aside from track races, mile races are also occasionally contested in cross country running and mile runs on the road include the Fifth Avenue Mile in New York City ...|$|R
50|$|The line climbed {{steadily}} from Newbury {{with some}} gentle falls also; the stiffest climb was from Newbury Fields to Speen, {{just over a}} <b>mile</b> <b>at</b> 1 in 75; and from East Garston to a summit just before Eastbury, about a <b>mile</b> <b>at</b> 1 in 100 average.|$|R
5|$|In autumn Lord Hastings, {{the owner}} of the 1885 Derby winner Melton issued a {{challenge}} to Jack Hammond for a £1,000 match race between his horse and St. Gatien, with Melton to receive nine pounds. The challenge was declined, as St. Gatien had already been heavily backed for the Cambridgeshire Handicap, a race in which he had been assigned 136 pounds and Hammond did not want to disrupt the horse's preparation. St. Gatien returned to the racecourse after a break of four months in Her Majesty's Plate over two <b>miles</b> <b>at</b> Newmarket on October 12. The race proved meaningless as a contest, his only opponent being a three-year-old filly called Jane who had finished runner-up in the 1000 Guineas. St. Gatien started at odds of 1/33 and won with predictable ease by twenty lengths.|$|E
5|$|On March 1, 1861, Davis {{appointed}} General P. G. T. Beauregard {{to command}} all Confederate {{troops in the}} vicinity of Charleston, South Carolina, where state officials prepared to take possession of Fort Sumter. Beauregard was to prepare his forces but await orders to attack the fort. Within the fort the issue was not of the niceties of geo-political posturing but of survival. They would be out of food on the 15th. The small Union crew had but half a dozen officers under Major Robert Anderson. Famously, this included the baseball folk hero Abner Doubleday. More improbable yet was a Union officer who had the name of Jefferson C. Davis. He would spend the war being taunted for his name but not his loyalty to the Northern cause. The newly installed President Lincoln, not wishing to initiate hostilities, informed South Carolina Governor Pickens that he was dispatching a small fleet of ships from the navy yard in New York to resupply but not re-enforce Fort Pickens in Florida and Fort Sumter. The US President did not inform CSA President Davis of this intended resupply of food and fuel. Jefferson Davis, for Lincoln, was the leader of an insurrection and so without legal standing in US affairs. To deal with him would be to give legitimacy to the rebellion. Holding to the belief that Sumter was the property of the sovereign United States was the reason for maintaining the garrison on the island fortress. He informed Gov. Pickens that the resupply mission would not land troops or munitions unless they were fired upon. As it turned out, just as the supply ships approached Charleston harbor, the bombardment would begin and the flotilla watched the spectacle from 10 <b>miles</b> <b>at</b> sea.|$|E

25|$|ACARS {{can send}} {{messages}} over VHF if a VHF ground station network {{exists in the}} current area of the aircraft. VHF communication is line-of-sight propagation and the typical range is up to 200 nautical <b>miles</b> <b>at</b> high altitudes.

25|$|The bluish {{color of}} water is a {{composite}} of several contributing agents. Prominent contributors include dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll. Mariners and other seafarers have reported that the ocean often emits a visible glow which extends for <b>miles</b> <b>at</b> night. In 2005, scientists announced {{that for the first}} time, they had obtained photographic evidence of this glow. It is most likely caused by bioluminescence.|$|E
