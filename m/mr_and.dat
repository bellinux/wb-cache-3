5|$|A logical {{extension}} of the humanist sans-serif concept is the font superfamily: a serif font and a matching humanist sans-serif with similar letterforms. Martin Majoor's FF Scala Sans is a popular example of this influenced by Gill's work, as are Charlotte Sans and Serif by Michael Gills for Letraset and <b>Mr</b> <b>and</b> Mrs Eaves by Zuzana Licko, {{which are based on}} Baskerville. Indeed, Monotype themselves released Joanna Sans in 2015, as a screen-optimised sans-serif font intended to complement (but not exactly match) Gill's serif design Joanna. It is intended for use at smaller sizes than Gill Sans.|$|E

5|$|Another critic has {{positively}} {{commented on}} McCloskey's use of page breaks as a pacing technique.

5|$|From the mid-1870s Busch's {{illustrations}} {{were printed}} using zincography. With this technique {{there was no}} longer any danger that a wood engraver could change the character of his drawings.

Busch's use of zincography began with <b>Mr.</b> <b>and</b> Mrs. Knopp.|$|E
