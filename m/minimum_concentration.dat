For comparison, the minimum threshold for optimal fish habitation is 5 milligrams per liter. In the aforementioned time period, the lowest concentration occurred in May 2010. The second-lowest concentration, approximately 7 milligrams per liter, occurred in June 2010. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the creek was nearly 17 milligrams per liter in January 2011 and February 2011.

25|$|Copper and its alloys {{demonstrated}} antimicrobial activities against multiple-antibiotic-resistant nosocomial {{bacteria and}} C. albicans {{isolated from the}} hospital, whereas stainless steel and PVC did not. Copper and its alloys showed a marked inhibitory effect (88–98%) on MTB despite the strain's drug resistance. The researchers concluded that the <b>minimum</b> <b>concentration</b> of copper {{to be an effective}} antimicrobial agent is >55% for yeasts and bacteria. Higher concentrations of copper were found to be necessary to inhibit MTB.|$|E
25|$|At high {{concentrations}} of cI, the dimers will also bind to operators OL1 and OL2 (which are over 2 kb downstream from the R operators). When cI dimers are bound to OL1, OL2, OR1, and OR2 a loop is induced in the DNA, allowing these dimers to bind together to form an octamer. This is a phenomenon called long-range cooperativity. Upon formation of the octamer, cI dimers may cooperatively bind to OL3 and OR3, repressing transcription of cI. This autonegative regulation ensures a stable <b>minimum</b> <b>concentration</b> of the repressor molecule and, should SOS signals arise, allows for more efficient prophage induction.|$|E

The <b>minimum</b> <b>concentration,</b> or partial pressure, of oxygen that can be tolerated is 16 kPa (0.16 bar). Below this, the astronaut is at risk of becoming unconscious and dying from hypoxia. In the vacuum of space, gas exchange in the lungs continues as normal but results in the removal of all gases, including oxygen, from the bloodstream. After 9 to 12 seconds, the deoxygenated blood reaches the brain, and it results in the loss of consciousness. Death would gradually follow after two minutes of exposure—though the absolute limits are uncertain.|$|E
500|$|When {{steel is}} {{immersed}} in water, adding a small concentration (55ppm) of potassium pertechnetate(VII) {{to the water}} protects the steel from corrosion, even if the temperature is raised to [...] For this reason, pertechnetate {{has been used as}} an anodic corrosion inhibitor for steel, although technetium's radioactivity poses problems that limit this application to self-contained systems. While (for example) [...] can also inhibit corrosion, it requires a concentration ten times as high. In one experiment, a specimen of carbon steel was kept in an aqueous solution of pertechnetate for 20years and was still uncorroded. The mechanism by which pertechnetate prevents corrosion is not well understood, but seems to involve the reversible formation of a thin surface layer (passivation). One theory holds that the pertechnetate reacts with the steel surface to form a layer of technetium dioxide which prevents further corrosion; the same effect explains how iron powder can be used to remove pertechnetate from water. (Activated carbon can also be used for the same purpose.) The effect disappears rapidly if the concentration of pertechnetate falls below the <b>minimum</b> <b>concentration</b> or if too high a concentration of other ions is added.|$|E
