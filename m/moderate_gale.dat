5|$|In {{the wake}} of Hurricane King moving northward through Florida, an area of low {{pressure}} developed into a tropical cyclone on October18 south of Louisiana. This storm was given the name Love and quickly strengthened, reaching hurricane status shortly thereafter. The storm initially moved westward across the Gulf of Mexico, but soon swung southward into the central portion of the Gulf on October19. Hurricane Love's maximum sustained winds are believed to have reached their peak intensity early on October 20. Throughout the hurricane's track, dry air infringed on the western side of the tropical cyclone's circulation, which produced unfavorable conditions for additional tropical cyclogenesis. On October20, the storm began curving northeastward towards the coast of western Florida; however, the dry air completely circled Love's center of circulation, drastically weakening the cyclone in the process. On October21, Love weakened to a tropical storm, and it struck the Big Bend region of Florida, north of Cedar Key. At the time, its winds were only of <b>moderate</b> <b>gale</b> force, and the storm degenerated into a trough of low pressure shortly thereafter. This combined with an approaching cold front to produce a powerful extratropical storm.|$|E
25|$|At 1655 on the 24th, in a <b>moderate</b> <b>gale,</b> Fortress C of 206 Squadron RAF from Benbecula, dropped six depth {{charges on}} {{the swirl of}} a diving U-boat. Fortress D found U-710 on the surface {{less than an hour}} later and sank it with depth charges as the U-boat {{attempted}} to fight back rather than submerge. U-710 was just 10 miles ahead of the convoy, though probably unaware of its proximity.|$|E
500|$|Widerøe Flight 839 was a {{scheduled}} flight from Værøy Airport to Bodø Airport operated with a de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter. The aircraft had registration LN-BNS and serial number 536, and {{was delivered to}} Widerøe on 27 April 1977. It was insured with Norsk Flyforsikringspool. The aircraft left Bodø Airport at 13:36 as Flight 838 to Røst Airport, where it landed at 14:04. It continued to Værøy as Flight 839, leaving Røst at 14:14. During this flight the crew received information that the wind at {{the east end of}} the runway was from 270°, varying from —a <b>moderate</b> <b>gale.</b> When the plane landed at 14:30, the tower had stated that the wind was from 270° and max [...] The crew commented on the wind after landing, and stated that the wind blew from all directions.

50|$|Moving ashore in Nicaragua a {{month after}} Tropical Storm Bret's passage, Gert caused {{excessive}} rainfall over already saturated regions. Despite striking the Atlantic coast, the storm produced the largest amounts of precipitation over northern and Pacific coastal areas. A maximum of 17.8 in (452 mm) fell at Corinto; other significant totals include 17.6 in (447 mm) at Chinandega and 17.5 in (444 mm) at León. The capital of Managua recorded 9.8 in (249 mm) of rain during the event. Sustained winds from the storm reached no more than 40 mph (65 km/h) upon landfall near Bluefields, though they downed trees and power lines and generated high waves of up to 12 feet (3.7 m) offshore. After weakening to a depression inland, Gert continued to produce <b>moderate</b> <b>gales</b> along its path through the country.|$|R
60|$|Roswell complied, {{and away}} the two schooners went, keeping quite near to each other, having smooth water, and still {{something}} of a <b>moderated</b> <b>gale,</b> in consequence of the proximity and weatherly position of the island. The course was towards a spot to leeward, where the largest opening appeared in the ice, and where it was hoped a passage to the northward would be found. The further the two vessels got from the land, the more they felt {{the power of the}} wind, and the greater was their rate of running. Daggett soon found that he could spare his consort a good deal of canvass, a consequence of his not being full, and he took in his topsail, though, running nearly before the wind, his spar would have stood even a more severe strain.|$|R

500|$|Kroonland sailed on {{her maiden}} voyage from New York to Antwerp on 28 June 1902. Kroonland {{remained}} on New York – Antwerp {{service for the}} next twelve years. In these early years of service, {{she was involved in}} two radio firsts. After the steering gear failed [...] west of Fastnet Rock during a <b>moderate</b> <b>gale</b> in early December 1903, the ship's crew was able to communicate their predicament via Marconi wireless system, becoming, according to one contemporary news account, the first ship in distress ever to use wireless. Kroonland put in at Queenstown, Ireland, for repairs, and transferred her passengers and freight to ships of the White Star Line, another IMM subsidiary. The other radio first came on 24 December 1906, when the ship's wireless operator heard—rather than the expected dots and dashes of morse code—the voice of a woman singing. The singing was followed by a recording of Handel's [...] "Largo", a poetry reading, and more music played from phonographs. The steamer was {{on the receiving end of}} what journalist and author Robert St. John called the [...] "first real broadcast of history", originated by early radio pioneer Reginald Fessenden from Brant Rock in Massachusetts.|$|E
60|$|During {{the next}} two days before a <b>moderate</b> <b>gale</b> the Scarrowmania {{shouldered}} her way westwards through the big, white-topped combers that rolled down upon her under a lowering sky. There were no luxurious, steam-propelled hotels in the Canadian trade at this time, and loaded deep with railway metal as she was, the vessel slopped in the green seas everywhere, and rolled her streaming sides out almost to her bilge. She shivered and rattled horribly when her single screw swung clear and the tri-compound engines ran away.|$|E
60|$|It may {{not have}} {{occurred}} to readers who are unacquainted with mechanics that the raising of ponderous stones to a great height {{is not an easy}} matter. As long as the lighthouse was low, cranes were easily raised on the rock, but when it became too high for the cranes to reach their heads {{up to the top of}} the tower, what was to be done? Block-tackles could not be fastened to the skies! Scaffolding in such a situation would not have survived a <b>moderate</b> <b>gale.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first {{identified in the}} Central Atlantic at 0600 UTC on November 3, with ships reporting <b>moderate</b> <b>gales</b> in its vicinity. Throughout its existence, the storm moved in an erratic path, generally to the north. Steadily intensifying, the {{tropical storm}} attained hurricane strength at 1800 UTC on November 6, as it began to move towards the northeast towards the Azores. The hurricane continued to intensify, attaining Category 2 intensity on November 8 {{and at the same}} time reaching its peak intensity with winds of 100 mph. After reaching peak intensity, a weakening trend began as the storm accelerated towards the northeast. Early on November 10, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, while still maintaining winds of hurricane force. The extratropical system continued to quickly move towards the northeast, until it coalesced with another extratropical cyclone on November 11.|$|R
50|$|As the {{calendar}} entered the new year, cyclogenesis occurred with a non-tropical frontal wave over the western North Atlantic Ocean {{due to a}} closed low forming in a mid-level trough, which eventually produced a low-pressure center at the surface by January 2. Ships recorded <b>moderate</b> <b>gales</b> up to 60 mi/h km/h {{in connection with the}} new surface low, which formed several hundred miles east-southeast of Bermuda. While initially lacking tropical attributes, the cyclone headed southeast for two days before curving southwestward. As it did so, the temperature of the system warmed in its lower levels, causing the cyclone to evolve into a more barotropic system. Late on January 4, the system shrunk in size and began developing an inner core; reanalysis determined that the system became a tropical storm at this time, though it would have likely been considered subtropical beginning in the early 1970s.|$|R
500|$|Further {{east in the}} Carolinas, {{five people}} were killed in the Piedmont region due to floods caused by the passing storm. Torrential {{rainfall}} in the area resulted in disruption of power, communications, and traffic. Precipitation in those two states peaked at 9in (230mm) in western North Carolina. In South Carolina, the heavy rainfall forced the issuance of flood warnings on the rising Santee River and its tributaries. The Broad and Congaree Rivers in South Carolina later set high water level records {{due in part to the}} saturated soils caused by the storm. The storm reached Virginia by August12, resulting in additional flooding. A weather station in Richmond, Virginia recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.53inHg). There, the James and Rivanna Rivers exceeded their respective flood stages, washing out peripheral crops. Offshore the Mid-Atlantic states, over 100 people were rescued after rough waves swept them away. <b>Moderate</b> <b>gales</b> associated with the storm were reported as far north as New York.|$|R
60|$|But {{there were}} exceptions. In the variables, {{if you wait}} long enough, {{something}} is bound to happen, and we were so plentifully stocked with food and water that we could afford to wait. On October 26, we actually made one hundred and three miles of easting, {{and we talked about}} it for days afterwards. Once we caught a <b>moderate</b> <b>gale</b> from the south, which blew itself out in eight hours, but it helped us to seventy-one miles of easting in that particular twenty-four hours. And then, just as it was expiring, the wind came straight out from the north (the directly opposite quarter), and fanned us along over another degree of easting.|$|E
60|$|The day {{dawned on}} a scene entirely {{different}} from that which had marked the tempestuous deformity of the night. The whole fury of the winds appear ed to have been expended in their precocious effort. From the <b>moderate</b> <b>gale,</b> to which they had fallen {{by the end of}} the middle watch, they further altered to a vacillating breeze; and, ere the sun had risen, the changeful air had subsided into a flat calm. The sea went down as suddenly as the power which had raised, it vanished; and, by the time the broad golden light of the sun was shed fairly and fully upon the unstable element, it lay unruffled and polished, though still gently heaving in swells so long and heavy as to resemble the placid respiration of a sleeping infant.|$|E
60|$|IT {{was blowing}} a <b>moderate</b> <b>gale,</b> and the “Aurania,” {{steaming}} {{at full speed}} into it, rolled viciously. A half‐moon shone out low down beneath wisps of whirling cloud, and the big black seas shook their frothing crests high aloft against the silvery light as they swept in long succession out of the night. The steamer met them with dipping forecastle from which the spray blew aft in clouds, lurched and hove her streaming bows high above the froth, rolled until one rail seemed level with the sea, and slid down into the hollow, out of which her head swung slowly up to meet the onslaught of the next. Bitter spray was flying everywhere, her decks ran water; {{but it was only}} between foremast and forecastle head she shipped it in cascades, and little groups of passengers stood where they could find shelter. They had finished their dinner with some difficulty, and because the vessel rolled so that it was not an easy task to keep one’s seat or footing had found their attempts to amuse themselves below a waste of effort.|$|E

50|$|At 1200 {{hours on}} 20 February 1918 Gallup, by then {{under the command}} of Ensign C. P. Berlin, USNRF, was {{anchored}} in the Harbor of Refuge at Lewes when a <b>moderate</b> northwest <b>gale</b> caused her to drag her anchor. The following morning, despite the fact that her engines were working at full power, Gallup ran aground, stern first, on the point of Cape Henlopen, Delaware, swinging around broadside to the beach. In response to her distress signals, United States Coast Guard crews from nearby lifesaving stations brought her complement ashore without loss of life. However, Gallup broke in two forward of her engine room and was declared a total loss.|$|R
60|$|Once {{the mental}} shock of moving {{unsupported}} {{through the air}} was over, his sensations ceased to be unpleasant, became very speedily pleasurable. He had been warned of air sickness. But he found the pulsating movement of the aeropile as it drove up the faint south-west breeze was very little {{in excess of the}} pitching of a boat head on to broad rollers in a <b>moderate</b> <b>gale,</b> and he was constitutionally a good sailor. And the keenness of the more rarefied air into which they ascended produced a sense of lightness and exhilaration. He looked up and saw the blue sky above fretted with cirrus clouds. His eye came cautiously down through the ribs and bars to a shining flight of white birds that hung in the lower sky. For a space he watched these. Then going lower and less apprehensively, he saw the slender figure of the Wind-Vane keeper's crow's nest shining golden in the sunlight and growing smaller every moment. As his eye fell with more confidence now, there came a blue line of hills, and then London, already to leeward, an intricate space of roofing. Its near edge came sharp and clear, and banished his last apprehensions in a shock of surprise. For the boundary of London was like a wall, like a cliff, a steep fall of three or four hundred feet, a frontage broken only by terraces here and there, a complex decorative facade.|$|E
60|$|With this Resolution, {{and under}} these Measures, we set Sail from the Island of St. Juan Fernando the 23d of September, (being the same there as our March is here) {{and keeping the}} Coast of Chili on Board, had good Weather for about a Fortnight, [Octob. 14.] till we came into the Latitude of 44 Degrees South; when finding the Wind come squally off the Shore from among the Mountains, we were oblig'd to keep farther out at Sea, where the Winds were less uncertain; and some Calms we met with, till about the Middle of October, [16.] when the Wind {{springing}} up at N. N. W. a pretty <b>moderate</b> <b>Gale,</b> we jogg'd S. E. and S. S. E. till we came into the Latitude of 55 Degrees; and the 16th of November, found our selves in 59 Degrees, the Weather exceeding cold and severe. But the Wind holding fair, we held in with the Land, and steering E. S. E. we held that Course till we thought ourselves entirely clear of the Land, and enter'd into the North Sea, or Atlantick Ocean; and then changing our Course, we steer'd N. and N. N. E. but the Wind blowing still at N. N. W. a pretty stiff Gale, we could make nothing of it till we made the Land in the Latitude of 52 Degrees; and when we came close under Shore, we found the Winds variable; so we made still N. under the Lee of the Shore, and made the Point of St. Julien the 13th of November, having been a Year and seven Days since we parted from thence on our Voyage Outwardbound.|$|E
6000|$|We {{sailed through}} the barren Archipelago, {{and into the}} narrow channel they {{sometimes}} call the Dardanelles and sometimes the Hellespont. This {{part of the country}} is rich in historic reminiscences, and poor as Sahara in every thing else. For instance, as we approached the Dardanelles, we coasted along the Plains of Troy and past the mouth of the Scamander; we saw where Troy had stood (in the distance,) and where it does not stand now--a city that perished when the world was young. The poor Trojans are all dead, now. They were born too late to see Noah's ark, and died too soon to see our menagerie. We saw where Agamemnon's fleets rendezvoused, and away inland a mountain which the map said was Mount Ida. Within the Hellespont we saw where the original first shoddy contract mentioned in history was carried out, and the [...] "parties of the second part" [...] gently rebuked by Xerxes. I speak of the famous bridge of boats which Xerxes ordered to be built over the narrowest part of the Hellespont (where it is only two or three miles wide.) A <b>moderate</b> <b>gale</b> destroyed the flimsy structure, and the King, thinking that to publicly rebuke the contractors might have a good effect on the next set, called them out before the army and had them beheaded. In the next ten minutes he let a new contract for the bridge. It has been observed by ancient writers that the second bridge was a very good bridge. Xerxes crossed his host of five millions of men on it, and {{if it had not been}} purposely destroyed, it would probably have been there yet. If our Government would rebuke some of our shoddy contractors occasionally, it might work much good. In the Hellespont we saw where Leander and Lord Byron swam across, the one to see her upon whom his soul's affections were fixed with a devotion that only death could impair, and the other merely for a flyer, as Jack says. We had two noted tombs near us, too. On one shore slept Ajax, and on the other Hecuba.|$|E
60|$|Of course Mr Cockran {{became very}} anxious about those {{he had left}} at home, for the storm had {{increased}} the danger of their position considerably. Happily, with the dawn the <b>gale</b> <b>moderated.</b> The improvement did not, indeed, render canoeing safe, for the white-crested waves of that temporary sea still lashed {{the shores of the}} new-made islet; but the case was urgent, therefore the clergyman launched his canoe, and, with Peegwish and the faithful Wildcat, steered for the station.|$|R
60|$|Three days did {{we remain}} on this island, while {{the wind and}} waves {{continued}} unceasingly to howl and lash around it, as if they wished, in their disappointment, to beat it down and swallow us up, island and all; but towards {{the close of the}} third day the <b>gale</b> <b>moderated,</b> and we ventured again to attempt the traverse. This time we succeeded, and in two hours passed Thunder Point, {{on the other side of}} which we encamped.|$|R

40|$|Mesoscale and {{microscale}} {{features of}} the turbulent winds over the ocean {{are related to the}} synoptic scale winds in terms of published spectral forms for the microscale, a mesoscale valley and published values of U*, VAR u', VAR v' and z/L, as defined in the text and as obtained for <b>moderate</b> to <b>gale</b> force winds. The frequencies involved correspond to periods longer than 1 hour and extend to the microscale, which starts at a period near 2 minutes, or so, and continues to the Kolmogorov inertial range. Nondimensional spectra that span both the mesoscale and the microscale are derived as a function of u, f(= n z/u) and z/L, where z is 10 meters, L is the Monin Obukov stability length and u is evaluated at 10 meters. For the same u, different values of z/L produce a range of values of u which in turn result in variations of the eddy structure of the mesoscale and microscale spectra. Both conventional anemometer averages and remotely sensed winds contain a random component of the mesoscale wind in their values. These components are differnces and not errors when winds are compared, and quantitative values for these differences are given. Ways to improve the measurement of the synoptic scale wind by transient ships, data buoys and scatterometers on future spacecraft are described. These ways are loner averaging times for ships and data buoys, depending on the synoptic conditions, and pooling spacecraft to form super observations. Design considerations for future remote sensing systems are given...|$|R
