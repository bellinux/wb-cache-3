This is an increasingly pressing problem for precision radial velocity (RV) spectrographs in the near-infrared (NIR) and optical that require both high stability of the observed line profiles and high signal to noise. Many of these spectrographs plan to use highly coherent emission line calibration sources like laser frequency combs and Fabry-Perot etalons to achieve precision sufficient to detect terrestrial mass planets. These high precision calibration sources often use single mode fibers or highly coherent sources.

40|$|A {{method to}} predict <b>modal</b> <b>noise</b> in short {{distance}} (30 m), high temporal bandwidth (hundreds of MHz) multimode optical links is proposed. In order to accommodate low cost, mechanical alignment, the link medium is modified from {{single mode fiber}} (used routinely in telecommunication systems) to multimode fiber. Modal dispersion in multimode fiber calls for a reduction in link length to preserve a relatively high temporal bandwidth. The source is a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL), which is well suited for the high packaging density, high temporal bandwidth, and low power dissipation requirements of short distance optical communication systems. Coherence properties of several different types of VCSELs are experimentally examined with constant and modulated injection current with a bandwidth typical of that used in data communications systems.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} limited <b>modal</b> and <b>noise</b> {{information}} on the Transformation Matrix Method is presented. This method detects structural damage and operates on the global stiffness matrix of a structure to condense on the primary degrees of freedom. The method {{is based on the}} fact that the transformation matrix for the damaged state can be initially estimated from the corresponding to the non damaged state, by using an iterative procedure. As data, the method is based on the condensed stiffness matrix of the structure that requires modal shapes and vibration frequencies identified from acceleration records. Initially, the localization of seismic instruments is defined. Afterwards, the acceleration records coming from the instrumented floors of the structure are obtained. From these, the dynamic characteristics of the structure are identified to reconstruct the condensed stiffness matrix. This matrix corresponds to the damaged state of the structure. Finally, using the adjusted condensed stiffness matrix with the dynamic characteristics of the structure and the analytically computed condensed stiffness matrix, the Transformation Matrix method locates damage in structural elements as the percentage of loss of stiffness. In this paper, the effect of ignoring all modal shapes and vibration frequencies in the damage detection of structures is studied.

In the first part, acoustical analyses were performed on modes of vibration of the housing of a transmission of a gear test rig developed by NASA. The modes of vibration of the transmission housing were measured using experimental modal analysis. The boundary element method (BEM) was {{used to calculate the}} sound pressure and sound intensity {{on the surface of the}} housing and the radiation efficiency of each mode. The radiation efficiency of each of the transmission housing modes was then compared to theoretical results for a finite baffled plate. In the second part, analytical and experimental validation of methods to predict structural vibration and radiated noise are presented. A rectangular box excited by a mechanical shaker was used as a vibrating structure. Combined finite element method (FEM) and boundary element method (BEM) models of the apparatus were used to predict the noise level radiated from the box. The FEM was used to predict the vibration, while the BEM was used to predict the sound intensity and total radiated sound power using surface vibration as the input data. Vibration predicted by the FEM model was validated by experimental <b>modal</b> analysis; <b>noise</b> predicted by the BEM was validated by measurements of sound intensity. Three types of results are presented for the total radiated sound power: sound power predicted by the BEM model using vibration data measured on the surface of the box; sound power predicted by the FEM/BEM model; and sound power measured by an acoustic intensity scan. In the third part, the structure used in part two was modified. A rib was attached to the top plate of the structure.

40|$|NIRPS (Near Infra-Red Planet Searcher) is an AO-assisted and fiber-fed {{spectrograph}} {{for high}} precision radial velocity measurements that will {{operate in the}} YJH-bands. While using an AO system in such instrument is generally considered to feed a single-mode fiber, NIRPS is following a different path by using a small multi-mode fiber (more specifically called "few-mode fiber"). This choice offers an excellent trade-off by allowing to design a compact cryogenic spectrograph, while maintaining a high coupling efficiency under bad seeing conditions and for faint stars. The main drawback resides {{in a much more}} important modal-noise, a problem that has to be tackled for allowing 1 m/s precision radial velocity measurements. We study the impact of using an AO system to couple light into few-mode fibers.

40|$|AbstractThe eigensystem {{realization}} algorithm (ERA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular methods in civil engineering applications for estimating the modal parameters, including complex-valued modal frequencies and modal vectors, of dynamic systems. In dealing with noisy measurement data, the ERA partitions the realized model into principal (signal) and perturbational (noise) portions so that the noise portion can be disregarded. During the separation of signal and noise, a critical issue is the determination for the dimensions of the block Hankel matrix which is built from noisy measurement data. We show that the signal and noise matrices can be better separated when the number of blockrows and number of block-columns of the corresponding block Hankel matrix are chosen to be close to each other. We introduce the concept of using the Frobenius norm (L 2 -norm) of the signal and noise matrices to quantify the signal to noise ratio in the global sense (involving multiple signals). We also propose a verification procedure to justify that the estimated <b>modal</b> parameters are <b>noise</b> insensitive and thus indeed associated with the true system. The procedure involves artificially injecting random noise into the measured signals (which are noisy signals) to create noisy-noisy signals, then comparing the identification results obtained respectively from the measured and noisynoisy signals. Using experimental data collected from a test plate, we demonstrate that if signal and noise portions have been properly separated while using the measured data, then the artificial noise would almost completely accumulate to the noise portion. Therefore, the modal estimation based on the signal portion only would remain the same by using either the measured or the noisy-noisy signals...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{requirements}} of short-distance digital communication links have increased considerably with the escalating demand for high speed and high density data links. The high aggregate bandwidth and channel density achievable by free-space optical interconnects (FSOIs) make them ideal replacement for electrical interconnection schemes. Optical interconnects potentially have low power consumption, and can facilitate {{the development of}} radically novel designs for VLSI architectures including heterogeneous multiprocessor systems, and highly parallel computing systems. Recent developments in the integration of Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) arrays and photodetector arrays with CMOS electronic circuitry have increased the practical potential of optical interconnects. However, VCSELs tend to operate in several transverse modes simultaneously, which will degrade the performance of FSOIs. Experimental investigation was performed to evaluate the operation characteristics and the intensity noise in VCSELs. The measurement results were later combined with optical simulations to analyse the effect of optical crosstalk in free-space optical interconnects. The VCSEL characterization included light-current-voltage relationships, relative intensity <b>noise,</b> <b>modal</b> spectral composition and modal beam profiles. The optical system simulation software (Code V) was used to simulate optical crosstalks in the FSOI system. Experimentally measured spectrally-resolved near-field images of VCSEL higher order modes were used as extended sources in the proposed simulation model. The simulation was performed {{using a combination of}} exact ray-tracing and the beam propagation method. A new type of crosstalk referred to as the stray-light crosstalk (SLC) was introduced. This type of crosstalk is caused by the overfill of the transmitter microlens by the VCSEL beam. It was discovered that part of the signal was imaged by the adjacent microlens to another channel, possibly far from the intended one. The simulation showed that the SLC is strongly dependent on the fill factor of the microlens, array pitch, and the channel density of the system. When comparing the diffraction-caused crosstalk (DCC) to SLC, an increase in the interconnection distance has little influence on the SLC. A simple behavioural model was developed which accurately approximates the crosstalk noise for a range of optical sources and interconnect configurations. The effect of transmitter and receiver array configurations on the performance of FSOIs was investigated. Our results demonstrate the importance of SLC in both square and hexagonal configuration. By changing the array lattice geometry from square to a hexagonal, we obtained an overall optical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement of 3 dB. The optical SNR is optimal for the hexagonal channel arrangement regardless of the transverse mode structure of the VCSEL beam was shown. Furthermore, the VCSEL drive current required for the best performance of the FSOI system was determined. The optimal focal length of the transmitter microlens array which maximises the SNR by minimising the combined effects of DCC and SLC was determined. Our results show that shorter focal length needs to be used for higher order modes to obtain optimal SNR in an FSOI system...|$|R

40|$|The signal {{quality of}} ﬁbre-coupled spectrographs can {{be limited by}} the {{inherent}} properties of the optical ﬁbre. This is especially the case for applications that require high signal-to-noise performance and high spectral resolution. Examples include metallicity and age of star clusters, as well as investigations of Lyman-alpha absorbers. Extra-solar planet research in particular encounters its limitations due to the non-repeatability of the ﬁbre response. Initially, a limited signal quality due to ﬁbres seems counter-intuitive, since {{one of the most}} remarkable advantages of ﬁbres is their signal stabilizing property, called image scrambling, which refers to the eﬀect that the ﬁbre output signal is largely insensitive to variations at the input side. However, the ﬁbre photometric and barycentre response is sub ject to external parameters like stress, seeing and guiding variations. State-of-the-art instrumentation has attained a level of sensitivity where these eﬀects will impact upon instrument performance, especially when advancing to a regime of spectral resolving powers where the quantized character of the standard optical ﬁbre can be resolved, which manifests itself in <b>modal</b> <b>noise.</b> Unprecedented eﬀort will be required in order to accomplish high resolving powers in the spectral and spatial domains with 40 m class telescopes. It is therefore essential to predict these ﬁbre-related measurement uncertainties so that the performance of current and future instruments can be optimized. This thesis starts out with a phenomenological description of the diﬀerent eﬀects that give rise to ﬁbre-related noise and its inﬂuence on the observables relevant to astrophysics, such as barycentre and photometric stability. Special emphasis is given to the photometric uncertainties related to <b>modal</b> <b>noise,</b> where ﬁrst a theoretical model is outlined which in later chapters will be sub ject to experimental investigations. Subsequently, the barycentre repeatability due to incomplete scrambling is the subject of detailed investigation. The remaining sources of noise are estimated using experimental data as well as simulations and put in contrast with the other eﬀects. Alongside the quantitative prediction of instrument instabilities, mitigation strategies will be presented and discussed. I conclude with a brief discussion of the impact of incomplete scrambling and <b>modal</b> <b>noise</b> on current instrumentation, the implications for future instrument pro jects as well as future work that will help to further understand and obviate the underlying mechanisms.

40|$|This letter {{describes}} a 30 -Gb/s bidirectional transparent optical transmission, over a 4. 4 -km multimode fiber (MMF) {{in combination with}} an indoor optical wireless (OW) link, which could provide limited mobility. Due to MMF's advantages, such as lower installation costs and easy maintenance, it is used as the access link. To enhance the MMFs bandwidth and provide the feasibility to use standard single-mode devices in the OW terminal (OWT), center launching and center detection techniques are both utilized. The stability of the indoor OW channel and the <b>modal</b> <b>noise</b> in MMF are investigated. Discrete multitone modulation with power and bit loading algorithms are applied to improve system's frequency utilization efficiency and robustness...|$|E
40|$|The authors report {{spurious}} free {{dynamic range}} measurements of 850 nm vertical cavity surface emitting lasers in short multimode links for radio frequency communication. For a 27 m fiber link, the dynamic range at optimal bias {{was greater than}} 95 dB-Hz{sup 2 / 3 } for modulation frequencies between 1 and 5. 5 GHz, which exceeds the requirements for antenna remoting in microcellular networks. In a free space link, they have measured the highest dynamic range in an 850 nm vertical cavity surface emitting laser of 113 dB-Hz{sup 2 / 3 } at 900 MHz. We have also investigated the effects of <b>modal</b> <b>noise</b> and differential mode delay on the dynamic range for longer lengths of fiber...|$|E
