25|$|The {{production}} of badges and emblems changed in 1956 to the rolled edge now in current use, thus eliminating the various colored backgrounds. The outside oval was then changed to red. With {{the introduction of}} the Improved Scouting Program in 1972 came an overhaul of many badges and emblems. The new stylized Eagle Scout badge with no text was a major change that proved to be unpopular. It appears that some Scouters commissioned reproductions of the 1956 badge for issue in place of the 1972 version. In 1975 the badge design partially reverted to the 1956 version. 1985 saw a reversion to the 1956 issue with some minor differences. The border and the eagle were done in silver <b>metalized</b> thread and the Be Prepared text was in blue. In 1986 the <b>metalized</b> eagle changed back to standard thread due to problems with wearing and the scroll and text were enlarged. The <b>metalized</b> border was changed to standard thread in 1989. Later variants increased the thread count of the white stripe to eliminate the visible background.|$|E
25|$|Nano-FTIR {{is based}} on s-SNOM, where the {{infrared}} beam from a light source is focused onto a sharp, typically <b>metalized</b> AFM tip and the backscattering is detected. The tip greatly enhances the illuminating IR light in the nanoscopic volume around its apex, creating a strong near field. A sample, brought into this near field, interacts with the tip electromagnetically and modifies the tip (back)scattering in the process. Thus by detecting tip scattering, one can obtain information about the sample.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrangement}} of plates and dielectric has many variations {{depending on the}} desired ratings of the capacitor. For small values of capacitance (microfarads and less), ceramic disks use metallic coatings, with wire leads bonded to the coating.

Larger value capacitors usually use a metal foil or metal film layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film to make the plates, and a dielectric film of impregnated paper or plasticthese are rolled up to save space. To reduce the series resistance and inductance for long plates, the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolled-up plates, not at the ends of the foil or <b>metalized</b> film strips that comprise the plates.|$|E

2500|$|In {{monopolar}} configuration {{the patient}} {{is attached to the}} dispersive electrode, a relatively large metal plate or a flexible <b>metalized</b> plastic pad which is connected to the RF generator or electrosurgical unit (ESU). The surgeon uses a pointed or blade shaped electrode called the [...] "active electrode" [...] to make contact with the tissue and exert a tissue effect...vaporization, and it's linear propagation called electrosurgical cutting, or the combination of desiccation and protein coagulation used to seal blood vessels for the purpose of Hemostasis. The electric current oscillates between the active electrode and the dispersive electrode with the entire patient interposed between the two. Since the concentration of the RF current reduces with distance from the active electrode the current density rapidly (quadratically) decreases. Since the rate of tissue heating is proportional to the square of current density, the heating occurs in a very localized region, only near the portion of the electrode, usually the tip, near to or in contact with the target tissue.|$|E

40|$|Autocatalytic {{electroless}} deposition, {{which is}} a conventional method to <b>metalize</b> nonmetallic substrates, requires catalyzation of substrates before deposition. For silicon (Si) substrates, obtaining adhesive metal films with conventional catalyzation pretreatment is difficult. In this study, we develop a new surface-activation process for the direct electroless deposition of adhesive metal films on Si substrates that consists of three steps: (1) metal nanoparticle formation by electroless displacement deposition; (2) Si nano-pore formation by metal-particle-assisted hydrofluoric acid etching; and (3) metal filling in nanopores and metal-film formation on the whole Si surface by autocatalytic electroless deposition. The metal nanorods in the Si act as catalytic nanoanchors to promote autocatalytic electroless metal deposition and improve the adhesion of the metal films on the Si substrates.

50|$|The tenth step is the {{prevention}} of further buildup via <b>metalizing</b> often called thermal spraying. Thermal spraying {{has been around for}} well over 100 years but is still widely known as the best preventative corrosion fighting technique in the world. Thermal spraying is also known for changing the surface of the metallic component and is common with rebuilt crankshafts. Thermal spraying involves protrusion of molten particles onto the heated metallic surface where is bonds and forms a smooth coating interwoven into the structure. There are many different types of thermal spray alloys that can be employed for re-manufactured crankshafts. Typically, boron alloys are used as they very dense, hard and are oxide free. They also prevent against abrasive materials that cause divots, scratches and cracks in addition to preventing surface erosion and corrosion. Thermal spray is an important step some machine shops employ, but not always performed in the industry.|$|R
