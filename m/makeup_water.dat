40|$|Injection of CO{sub 2 }-laden {{flue gas}} can {{decrease}} {{the potential for}} silica and calcite scale formation in cooling tower blowdown by lowering solution pH to decrease equilibrium calcite solubility and kinetic rates of silica polymerization. Flue gas injection might best inhibit scale formation in power plant cooling towers that use impaired <b>makeup</b> <b>waters</b> - for example, groundwaters that contain relatively high levels of calcium, alkalinity, and silica. Groundwaters brought to the surface for cooling will degas CO{sub 2 } and increase their pH by 1 - 2 units, possibly precipitating calcite in the process. Recarbonation with flue gas can lower the pHs of these fluids back to roughly their initial pH. Flue gas carbonation probably cannot lower pHs to much below pH 6 because the pHs of impaired waters, once outgassed at the surface, {{are likely to be}} relatively alkaline. Silica polymerization to form scale occurs most rapidly at pH {approx} 8. 3 at 25 C; polymerization is slower at higher and lower pH. pH 7 fluids containing {approx} 220 ppm SiO{sub 2 } require > 180 hours equilibration to begin forming scale whereas at pH 8. 3 scale formation is complete within 36 hours.

Wet FGDs represent a physicochemically extreme environment due to the high operating temperatures and total dissolved solids of fluids {{in the interior of}} the FGD units. Despite the potential importance of microbial activities in the performance and operation of FGD systems, the microbial communities associated with them have not been evaluated. Microbial communities associated with distinct process points of FGD systems at several coal fired electricity generation facilities were evaluated using culture-dependent and –independent approaches. Due to the high solute concentrations and temperatures in the FGD absorber units, culturable halothermophilic/tolerant bacteria were more abundant in samples collected from within the absorber units than in samples collected from the <b>makeup</b> <b>waters</b> that are used to replenish fluids inside the absorber units. Evaluation of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes recovered from scale deposits on the walls of absorber units revealed that the microbial communities associated with these deposits are primarily composed of thermophilic bacterial lineages.

50|$|Also, {{operators}} had {{to prepare}} an alternate injection line for each unit, as the RCIC can run indefinitely only {{while there is}} sufficient pressure and steam in the reactor to drive its turbine; once reactor pressure drops below a certain level, the RCIC shuts down automatically. The normal AC driven Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) were {{for the most part}} unavailable due to the loss of ultimate heat sink and damage to some of the electrical infrastructure. Operators prepared for this and set up an alternate injection line using a non-emergency system known as the <b>Makeup</b> <b>Water</b> Condensate System to maintain water level which was an accident mitigation method TEPCO put in place at all its nuclear plants. The system was started and stopped in all 4 units, including unit 3, as needed to maintain the water level. The RCICs in each unit later shut down due to low reactor pressure. Operators had to also use the MUWC and the <b>makeup</b> <b>water</b> purification and filtering (MUPF) system to try to cool the suppression pool and drywell in addition to the reactor to prevent the drywell pressure from getting too high. Operators were later able to restore the High Pressure Core Spray portion of the ECCS in unit 4 and switched emergency water injection for unit 4 from the MUWC system to the HPCS. While the water level was maintained in the three cores using emergency water injection, pressures in the containment vessel continued to rise due to lack of suppression pool cooling and the operators prepared to vent the containments making restoration of heat removal urgent. Unit 1 was prioritized as it had the highest drywell pressure.|$|E
5000|$|The RCIC system {{operates}} on high-pressure steam from the reactor itself, {{and thus is}} operable with no electric power other than battery power to operate the control valves. Those turn the RCIC on and off as necessary to maintain correct water levels in the reactor. (If run continuously, the RCIC would overfill the reactor and send water down its own steam supply line.) During a station blackout (where all off-site power is lost and the diesel generators fail) the RCIC system may be [...] "black started" [...] with no AC and manually activated. The RCIC system condenses its steam into the reactor suppression pool. The RCIC can make up this water loss, from either of two sources: a <b>makeup</b> <b>water</b> tank located outside containment, or the wetwell itself. RCIC is not designed to maintain reactor water level during a LOCA or other leak. Similar to HPCI, the RCIC turbine can be run in recirculation mode to remove steam from the reactor and help depressurize the reactor.|$|E
40|$|Reclaimed water {{belongs to}} one of <b>makeup</b> <b>waters</b> {{to be applied to}} {{agricultural}} production, which can not only reduce the quantity of wastewater effluent, but also reduce the quantity in demand of good-quality water, and is key element in utilization of limited water resources. Through field experimental method and taking drip irrigation, the regulation of reclaimed water drip irrigation on dynamic variation of nitrogen in soil was studied in this paper. The results indicate that compared to the contrast treatment, NH 4 + N content in the surface layer increased sharply in the initial period after reclaimed water drip irrigation, and then decreased significantly in the fifth day, and down to the level before irrigation on the ninth day, which was uniform between soil layers. NO 3 -N content under all the treatments presented the almost same trend in soil profile: NO 3 -N content increased with the soil depth, indicating an obvious tendency of NO 3 -N leaching down to lower layers. However, at the depth of 100 - 150 cm, NO 3 -N content began to decrease. When reclaimed water drip irrigation was used for cucumber planting, NO 3 -N content in different layers at the ending of the growing period increased by 38. 20 %, 44. 67 %, 34. 94 %, 30. 88 %, respectively, than that before planting.

5000|$|The {{high-pressure}} coolant {{injection system}} is {{the first line of}} defense in the emergency core cooling system. HPCI is designed to inject substantial quantities of water into the reactor while it is at high pressure so as to prevent the activation of the automatic depressurization, core spray, and low-pressure coolant injection systems. HPCI is powered by steam from the reactor, and takes approximately 10 seconds to spin up from an initiating signal, and can deliver approximately 19,000 L/min (5,000 US gal/min) to the core at any core pressure above 6.8 atm (690 kPa, 100 psi).

40|$|There is a {{projected}} water shortage {{problem in the}} electrical power industry {{by the end of}} this century. Dry and wet-dry cooling towers are going to be the solution of this problem. Our previous study on the combination of separate dry and wet cooling towers indicated that wet-dry cooling is an economical choice over all-dry cooling when some water is available but the supply is insufficient for an evaporative tower. An advanced wet-dry cooling tower concept was experimentally studied at MIT's Heat Transfer Laboratory and a computer model was developed for predicting the performance of this cooling concept. This study has determined the cost of the cross-flow type of this cooling concept in conjunction with steam electrical power plants. Aluminum is found to be economically preferable to galvanized steel as the cooling plate material. In our base case study using aluminum plates for a 1094 MWe nuclear plant at Middletown, the MIT advanced cooling concept is comparable to conventional wet-dry towers at <b>water</b> <b>makeups</b> larger than 45 % and is slightly more economical at makeup larger than 50 %. The incremental costs over the power production cost, 32. 3 mills/Kwhr, of zero condenser system are 14, 13 and 12 percent for makeups of 45, 60 and 55 percent, respectively. For an 800 MWe fossil plant at Moline, this cooling concept is more economical than conventional wet-dry towers at <b>water</b> <b>makeups</b> larger than 27 %. The incremental costs over 20. 8 mills/Kwhr of zero condenser system are 12. 2 and 10. 6 percent for makeups of 37 and 50 percent, respectively.
