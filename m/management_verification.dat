40|$|This {{reports on}} the results of a survey {{conducted}} on engineers involved in the acquisition of robotic systems from academic, government, and industrial sectors. Respondents indicated their perception of the importance and effectiveness of various types of engineering practices that were employed by these customers in support of their most recent robotic system acquisition. The survey focused on engineering practices from the areas of requirements development, technical <b>management,</b> <b>verification,</b> and validation. Examination of how the opinions and effectiveness of the engineers change over successive experiences give us an indication of what classes of engineering methods are currently being addressed or ignored during the education of the engineers. Ultimately, by examining the responses, we can conclude some areas of engineering that engineers still lack routinely effective methods to help them acquire the right robot to fulfill the organization's need...|$|E
40|$|Design {{automation}} {{over the}} years has taken many forms. Engineering projects of every description have been targeted by computer specialists as systems which might benefit from automation. Today, several major firms are marketing CAD/CAM systems in a big way. Electrical design workstations and mechanical part workstations and data bases have been most successful and these companies are continually refining and improving their systems looking towards the future. Though there are many consulting firms available to assist in the automation of an interested engineering organization, many project managers still resist the automation tide. This paper is an exploration of several areas which will need to be addressed {{in the years to come}} if automation is to be successfully applied to even the most complex of engineering undertakings. The exploration is facilitated through the elucidation of important structures which appear in engineering organizations. The hope is that through the understanding of these implicit structures, computational systems can be built which reflect these structures and thereby provide additional project coherence. The primary areas affected are <b>management,</b> <b>verification,</b> inter-module communication and integration. This work is continuing under the leadership of Dr. F. B. Thompson at the California Institute of Technology...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Distributed {{simulation}} {{requires a}} novel approach to exercise <b>management</b> and <b>Verification,</b> Validation and Accreditation (VV&A). With the introduction of (geographically) distributed simulations, exercise management consists of managing a multitude of simulators in a common scenario. This imposes new challenges with respect to managing the distributed responsibilities of the simulation. As with exercise management, distributed simulations impose new challenges on VV&A with respect to distributed responsibilities. NLR’s exercise management tool SmartFED (Scenario Manager for Real-Time Federation Directing) is designed to meet these new challenges. This paper provides insight into SmartFED’s concepts and practical experiences {{in the field of}} distributed real-time (training) simulations...|$|R
50|$|Health exchanges first {{emerged in}} the private sector in the early 1980s, and they used {{computer}} networking to integrate claims <b>management,</b> eligibility <b>verification,</b> and inter-carrier payments. These became popular in some regions as a way for small and medium-sized businesses to pool their purchasing power into larger groups, reducing cost. An additional advantage was the ability of small businesses to offer a range of plans to employees, allowing them to compete with larger corporations. The largest such exchange prior to the ACA is CaliforniaChoice, established in 1996. By 2000, CaliforniaChoice's membership included 140,000 individuals from 9000 business groups.|$|R

40|$|The Chemical Management System (CMS), {{currently}} under development at Hanford, {{was used as}} the ''test program'' for pilot testing the value added aspects of the Chemical Manufacturers Association's (CMA) <b>Management</b> Systems <b>Verification</b> (MSV) process. The MSV process, which was developed by CMA's member chemical companies specifically as a tool to assist in the continuous improvement of environment, safety and health (ESH) performance, represents a commercial sector ''best practice'' for evaluating ESH management systems. The primary purpose of Hanford's MSV Pilot was to evaluate the applicability and utility of the MSV process in the Department of Energy (DOE) environment. However, because the Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS) is the framework for ESH management at Hanford and at all DOE sites, the pilot specifically considered the MSV process {{in the context of a}} possible future adjunct to Integrated Safety <b>Management</b> System <b>Verification</b> (ISMSV) efforts at Hanford and elsewhere within the DOE complex. The pilot involved the conduct of two-hour interviews with four separate panels of individuals with functional responsibilities related to the CMS including the Department of Energy Richland Operations (DOE-RL), Fluor Daniel Hanford (FDH) and FDH's major subcontractors (MSCS). A semi-structured interview process was employed by the team of three ''verifiers'' who directed open-ended questions to the panels regarding the development, integration and effectiveness of management systems necessary to ensure the sustainability of the CMS effort. An ''MSV Pilot Effectiveness Survey'' also was completed by each panel participant immediately following the interview...|$|R
