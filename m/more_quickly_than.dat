40|$|The goal of {{the present}} {{experiments}} {{was to examine the}} accessibility of concepts embedded within text. J. A. Albrecht and E. J. O’Brien (1991) found that with narrative texts central concepts are <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> retrieved <b>than</b> peripheral concepts. In contrast, F. R. Yekovich and C. H. Walker (1986) found that when concepts are embedded within scripts, peripheral concepts are <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> retrieved <b>than</b> central concepts. Over 13 experiments, central concepts were generally <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> accessed <b>than</b> peripheral concepts. The only exception occurs when (a) script-based texts are used, (b) the number of mentions or elaboration of central and peripheral concepts is held constant, and (c) the measure of centrality is theme relatedness rather than degree of interconnectedness. Under those conditions, central concepts are more difficult to access than peripheral concepts...|$|R

Elven bodies eventually stop aging physically, while human bodies do not.|$|E

5|$|On 7 October 1964, Vulcan B.2 XM601 crashed during {{overshoot}} from an asymmetric power practice approach at Coningsby. The copilot had executed the asymmetric {{power approach}} with two engines producing thrust and two at idle. He was being checked by the Squadron Commander, who was {{unfamiliar with the}} aircraft. When he commenced the overshoot the copilot moved all the throttles to full power. The engines that had been producing power reached full power <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>than</b> the engines at idle and the resultant asymmetric thrust exceeded the available rudder authority, causing the aircraft to spin and crash.

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of calcium {{is that of}} a typical heavy alkaline earth metal. For example, calcium spontaneously reacts with water <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>than</b> magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air to form a mixture of calcium oxide and calcium nitride. When finely divided, it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride. In bulk, calcium is less reactive: it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air, but below 30% relative humidity it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature.|$|E

5|$|Water {{temperature}} {{affects the}} sea turtle's metabolic rate. Lethargy is induced at temperatures between 13 and 15°C (55 and 59°F).

However, younger loggerheads are more resistant to cold and do not become stunned until temperatures drop below 9°C. The loggerheads' migration helps to prevent instances of cold-stunning.

A loggerhead's body temperature increases in warmer waters <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>than</b> it decreases in colder water; their critical thermal maximum is currently unknown.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{working on}} the Midland Railway's main line, Barlow {{established}} that the replacement of sleepers was a larger {{part of the cost}} of track maintenance than the replacement of rails because the sleepers decayed <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>than</b> the rails wore-out and needed renewal more often. To remove the cost of providing and replacing sleepers, he developed and patented his own rail design in 1849. It had a wide flanged profile which could be laid directly on to track ballast without the need for sleepers, with just periodic tie-bars to maintain the correct gauge. Known as the Barlow rail, it was widely used, especially by the Great Western Railway.|$|E
5|$|According to Caltrain, the {{electrification}} {{project will}} bring multiple {{benefits to the}} corridor. Firstly, electric trains can accelerate and decelerate <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>than</b> the existing diesel locomotives, resulting in faster and more frequent service. They will also replace Caltrain's current diesel locomotives and passenger cars, {{a significant portion of}} which are nearing the end of their lives. Additionally, electric trainsets are quieter and produce less air pollution that diesel locomotives, and the use of electric trains will lower Caltrain's fuel costs while increasing passenger revenue, due to an expected increase in ridership. Once complete, Caltrain expects to annually reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 176,000 metric tons and increase daily ridership by 21% by 2040. Daily service may be restored to Atherton and Broadway stations. Caltrain plans to complete the project by the end of 2021.|$|E
