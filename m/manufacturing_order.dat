In manufacturing, jobs are scheduled through a factory to sequence {{them in the}} best order to meet due dates and reduce costs. In services, it is customers who are being scheduled. As a result, waiting time becomes much more critical. While <b>manufacturing</b> <b>orders</b> don't mind waiting in line or waiting in inventory, real customer's do mind. Some of the scheduling applications for services are: scheduling of patients to operating rooms in hospitals and scheduling students to classes. Many scheduling problems have been solved by using operations research methods to optimize the schedule.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Under the {{conditions}} of the mode of production drifting towards extensive collaboration mode, the process capacity oriented to machining factory should be analyzed and estimated, which is the essential precondition for factory to decide whether to accept a piece of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>order</b> form. Based on the situation, with the production quality checking and analysis focused, a kind of process capacity analysis and estimation was brought forward for the collaborational machining factory under the mode of quality control. The model based on quality driven for the process capacity estimation was provided to solve the critical problem. And the network service system of process capacity estimation was established, by making full use of quality function analysis (QFD), similar procedure query and rough set theory combined with the character parameters such as work-part size tolerance, surface roughness, manufacturing time, cost and etc. Furthermore, some key enabling technologies were instigated in detail, including quality control technology oriented low volume customization and process capacity analysis technology based on rough set (RS) theory...|$|E
