5|$|A general {{hospital}} {{is located in}} {{the eastern side of the}} city. Modern health care facilities exist only in Bangui but are poor, providing only minimal care. Wealthier citizens make use of private clinics. The risk of catching HIV in the city is reportedly high, and many truck drivers stopping in the city for sexual services pose a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> of spreading the disease to other parts of the country. The risk of catching malaria in Bangui and pygmy camps is also much higher than in the rest of the country.|$|E
5|$|Hypertension (HTN or HT), {{also known}} as high blood {{pressure}} (HBP), is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms. Long-term high blood pressure, however, is a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} {{are most often}} caused by physical trauma. Forces involved can be hyperflexion (forward movement of the head); hyperextension (backward movement); lateral stress (sideways movement); rotation (twisting of the head); compression (force along the axis of the spine downward from the head or upward from the pelvis); or distraction (pulling apart of the vertebrae). Traumatic SCI can result in contusion, compression, or stretch injury. It is a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> of many types of vertebral fracture. Pre-existing asymptomatic congenital anomalies can cause major neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis, to result from otherwise minor trauma.|$|E
40|$|The ageing of {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{population}} over the next 30 years means {{that there will be}} increased demand for products such as lifetime annuities to provide steady and reliable income streams to retirees. It has been known for some time that lifetime annuities bring significant risks to the issuer, but there has not been much research at the annuity portfolio level as to exactly what the <b>major</b> <b>risks</b> are, and how to manage them. This paper looks at pools of lifetime annuities, identifies the <b>major</b> <b>risks,</b> and then discusses the relative merits of alternative management techniques given the <b>major</b> <b>risks</b> are in the Knightian uncertain category. The paper concludes that lifetime annuities can be written, but the <b>major</b> <b>risks</b> require a national reinsurance approach to ensure sustainability...|$|R

5|$|Substance misuse, {{dependence}} and withdrawal {{are associated with}} self-harm. Benzodiazepine dependence as well as benzodiazepine withdrawal is associated with self-harming behaviour in young people. Alcohol is a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> factor for self-harm. A study which analysed self-harm presentations to emergency rooms in Northern Ireland found that alcohol was a major contributing factor and involved in 63.8% of self-harm presentations. A recent study in the relation between cannabis use and deliberate self-harm (DSH) in Norway and England found that, in general, cannabis use {{may not be a}} specific risk factor for DSH in young adolescents.|$|E
5|$|A {{small group}} of {{toddlers}} show a distressing way of reuniting after a separation. Called a disorganized/disoriented style, this reunion pattern can involve looking dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors that seem to imply fearfulness {{of the person who}} is being sought. Disorganized attachment has been considered a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> factor for child psychopathology, as it appears to interfere with regulation or tolerance of negative emotions and may thus foster aggressive behavior. Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research has demonstrated both within-the-child and environmental correlates of disorganized attachment.|$|E
5|$|Women {{experience}} many unique {{health issues}} related to reproduction and sexuality and these are responsible for {{a third of all}} health problems experienced by women during their reproductive years (aged 15–44), of which unsafe sex is a <b>major</b> <b>risk</b> factor, especially in developing countries. Reproductive health includes {{a wide range of issues}} including the health and function of structures and systems involved in reproduction, pregnancy, childbirth and child rearing, including antenatal and perinatal care. Global women's health has a much larger focus on reproductive health than that of developed countries alone, but also infectious diseases such as malaria in pregnancy and non-communicable diseases (NCD). Many of the issues that face women and girls in resource poor regions are relatively unknown in developed countries, such as female genital cutting, and further lack access to the appropriate diagnostic and clinical resources.|$|E
