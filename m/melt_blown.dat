50|$|Melt-blown {{nonwovens}} {{are produced}} by extruding melted polymer fibers through a spin net or die consisting of up to 40 holes per inch to form long thin fibers which are stretched and cooled by passing hot air over the fibers as they fall from the die. The resultant web is collected into rolls and subsequently converted to finished products. The extremely fine fibers (typically polypropylene) differ from other extrusions, particularly spun bond, in that they have low intrinsic strength but much smaller size offering key properties. Often <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> is added to spun bond to form SM or SMS webs, which are strong and offer the intrinsic benefits of fine fibers such as fine filtration, low pressure drop as used in face masks or filters and physical benefits such as acoustic insulation as used in dishwashers.

Melt blowing is a one-step process producing microfibers {{with an average}} fiber diameter (dav) of 1 – 5 μm. One application of <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> fibers is filter media of water-in-diesel engine fuel filtration. In {{order to meet the}} increasingly higher requirements on fuel cleanliness, enhancing the filter efficiency has been desired. One attractive strategy is applying nanofibers (dav < 1 μm). The other is modifying the fiber surface wetting properties, such as superhydrophobic. The goal of this work is to produce <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> nano-/micro-fibers with superhydrophilic and/or superhydrophobic surfaces for water-in-diesel filtration. In this thesis, we advanced the new technique of producing nanofibers from <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> fiber-in-fiber polymer blends by understanding the nanofiber formation and developing water-extractable nanofibers. Firstly, poly(styrene) (PS) /poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) and PS/poly(ethylene-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (ECTFE) binary blends were <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> followed by tetrahydrofuran (THF) extraction. The control extrusions demonstrated that the core nanofibers were primarily generated during the fiber blowing process. We speculate that both aerodynamic and fiber-fiber drag influence the nanofiber formation. Varying the minor phase volume fraction revealed the nanofiber breakup. We proposed that both the single-droplet-elongation and dumbbell-formation contribute to the formation of nanofibers. In addition, we hypothesize that the coalescence leads to the formation of non-uniform nano-/micro-fibers. Following the discussion on nanofiber formation, we showed nanofiber fabrication from water-extractable <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> fiber-in-fiber polymer blends containing a water-dispersible sulfopolyester (SP). This new method eliminates issues associated with organic solvents. Also, it provides another route to prepare multilayer nano-/micro-fiber composites. Surface wetting modifications of <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> PBT fibers were achieved by alkaline hydrolysis and subsequent fluorination. Application of alkaline hydrolysis generates sponge-like PBT fibers decorated with hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups, resulting in a superhydrophilic fiber mat surface. The subsequent fluorination creates a sticky-superhydrophobic surface. An alternative achieving enhanced or even superhydrophobic PBT fiber surfaces is incorporation of a random perfluorinated multiblock copolyester (PFCE). Adding only 5 wt% of PFCE into PBT leads to over 20 wt% of PFCE on PBT fiber surfaces. The blooming of fluorine and the overall mat roughness increased the water contact angle from about 128 ° to above 150 ° and lowered the fiber mat surface adhesion energy by 25 %. Finally, the appendices show some preliminary works on: 1) synthesis and characterizations of poly(L-lactide) and perfluoropolyether block copolymer; 2) the effects of alkaline hydrolysis on surface topography and mechanical properties of <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> PBT fiber mats; 3) compatibilized polyamide 6 and poly(ethene-co-tetrafluoroethene) (PETFE) blends, which, however, were not suitable for melt blowing due to high viscosity; 4) collection of individual <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> nanofibers...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> samples were {{produced}} from three hardness grades of ether based thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers (TPU). The fabrics were tested to investigate their structure-property relationship in a <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> process.

Tensile and elongation properties depended on die-to-collector distance (DCD), polymer hardness and fiber ODF.

It was demonstrated that recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can be <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> into nonwoven webs, but with poorer performance properties, due to the larger diameter of the fibers.

The webs produced with undried PET had smaller fiber diameter, higher tenacity in the machine direction and lower air permeability. The greater drop in intrinsic viscosity indicated that more hydrolytic degradation occurred during processing of the undried PET. The webs produced from blends of recycled-PET/PBT as well as recycled-PET/low IV-PET had smaller fiber diameter, lower air permeability and higher tenacity in machine direction than those of 100 % recycled PET webs.

40|$|Abstract. Melt blowing is {{a typical}} {{nonwoven}} process for producing superfine fibers. In this process, the high velocity hot air jets attenuate the polymer melt into superfine fibers. Therefore, the fiber diameter is strongly affected by the air flow field. Dual slot die {{is one of the}} widely used melt blowing dies. Hot air emits from the two slots symmetrically. What will happen to the polymer drawing if the air jets are unsymmetrical? In this paper, the unsymmetrical air flow field of the dual slot die in melt blowing process is simulated numerically. The distributions of air velocity and air temperature are obtained. The polymer drawing model is then solved with the aid of the simulation results of air velocity and air temperature. The diameter and transverse displacement of the threadline along the spinline is achieved. The result shows that the threadline diameter of unsymmetrical air flow field is larger than that of the symmetrical air flow field and the threadline tends to deflect because of the unsymmetrical air jets.

40|$|AIM—The {{goal was}} to compare the {{biological}} response of the corneal stroma with three porous materials: a <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> microfibre web of polybutylene:polypropylene (80 : 20); a polyester spun laced fabric (polyethylene terephthalate), and an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. Fifty per cent {{of each of the}} materials were modified using argon radio frequency.  METHODS—Discs (6  mm in diameter) were inserted into interlamellar stromal pockets and followed for a period of 12  weeks. Clinical evaluations were performed weekly. At 6  and 12  weeks, fibroplasia and the distribution of matrix proteins and growth factors (bFGF and TGF-β) were evaluated immunohistochemically. The characterisation of glycosaminoglycans was determined after selective extraction and digestion.  RESULTS—The response to the disc resembled that of a wound with a decrease in keratan sulphate and an increase in dermatan sulphate. Pretreatment of the discs reduced corneal oedema and neovascularisation. Heparan sulphate, not normally detected in the corneal stroma, was detected in the region immediately surrounding the disc and in the discs of some materials. The presence of glycosaminoglycans and collagens in the disc indicated that cells had migrated into the disc and deposited a complex matrix in all three materials. The collagen response was not surface specific. bFGF and TGF-β were detected in the region between the disc and the stroma in the polybutylene material and became diffuse with time.  CONCLUSION—Fibroplasia occurred most rapidly into the polyester discs but was accompanied by a large number of inflammatory cells. While the distribution of collagens was not altered by the material, the expression and distribution of growth factors was material dependent. bFGF was expressed transiently and occurred before that of TGF-β. It is predicted that the transient expression of growth factors mediates the regulation of matrix proteins.    Keywords: synthetic cornea; basic fibroblast growth factor; glycosaminoglycans; wound healing; corne...|$|E
30|$|Fibrous {{materials}} are well-known for large specific surface area, fast absorption rate, and excellent actual operability. Some researchers have reported {{a lot of}} fibrous materials {{which can be used}} as oil absorbents, for example, the fibers prepared via dry-wet spinning (Feng and Xiao 2006), gelation spinning (Xu and Xiao 2010), wet spinning (Zhao et al. 2011), melt spinning (Zhao et al. 2012), reactive extrusion-melt spinning (Ma et al. 2013), and graft modification (Li and Wei 2012). Due to good practicability and wide applicability, non-woven fabrics, such as <b>melt</b> <b>blown</b> polypropylene non-woven fabric (Zhao et al. 2013 a, b), are another important fibrous material which can be used as oil absorbent (Radetic et al. 2008). The above-mentioned fibrous materials involving the fibers and non-woven fabrics can absorb a large amount of oily organic liquids; however, since the fibrous {{materials are}} composed of thick fibers, they absorb organic liquids at a relatively slow rate, which has an adverse effect on their application. Electrospun fibrous materials are of great advantage to oil absorption rate for the reason that the diameter of electrospun fibers can reach nanometer level (Zhu et al. 2011). In recent years, some polymers, such as polyacrylonitrile (Su et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2014), poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (Tang et al. 2013), and cellulose acetate (Shang et al. 2012), have been electrospun into fibrous materials and used as oil absorbents to separate oil from water. Polystyrene, as a commonly solvent-soluble and thermoplastic polymer, has more excellent electrospinnability in comparison with other polymers, thus electrospun polystyrene fibrous material has been used widely as oil absorbent (Lin et al. 2012, 2013; Lee et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2012). However, polystyrene is a kind of rigid polymer, thus its electrospun fibrous material exhibits some disadvantages. First, some fibers can fall off the fibrous material due to weak cohesive force among fibers. Second, owning to low temperature brittleness, some fibers break at low temperature, and the fibrous material shows poor strength. Therefore, it is very necessary to improve the performance of electrospun polystyrene fibrous material. The previous work showed that electrospun poly (meth)acrylate fibers could adhere to each other to provide a strong cohesive force for fibrous material (Mo et al. 2014); additionally, poly (butyl acrylate) has good low temperature resistance because it has the properties similar to those of natural rubber. Thereby it was proposed that to copolymerize with butyl acrylate was an effective approach to supply electrospun polystyrene material with good cohesive force and flexibility. As a consequence, the shortages of electrospun polystyrene material could be remedied easily.|$|E
