40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the ecotoxicological effects of the herbicide Ustinex (active ingredients: Amitol and Diuron) and the insecticide E 605 (active ingredient: Parathion) in laboratory test systems, in microcosms and in the field. The microbial biomass of the soil as well as the abundance, biomass and the number of species of the earthworms and enchytraeids were chosen as parameters to quantify ecotoxicological effects. The comparison of the results derived from the three differently complex organizational levels showed that many of the measured effects in the <b>microsoms</b> and in the field were similar during the study period of four months; the results derived from the laboratory test systems, however, were significantly different. In particular it was striking that the effects on the Oligochaeta were more accentuated in the microcosms and in the field than under laboratory test conditions. Additionally the apparent photosynthesis of single levels from plants grown on microcosms was measured after application of the test substances. Dependent on the plant species investigated and the test substance applied the apparent photosynthesis changed after a few days of exposure indicating an effect on the primary production of the model ecosystem. In a further section of this report it was discussed whether the microcosm used in this study could be a useful tool to obtain ecologically relevant data when investigating the effects and fate of chemicals.

40|$|Abstract. Connexins, the {{proteins}} that form gap junction channels, are polytopic plasma membrane (PM) proteins that traverse the plasma membrane bilayer four times. The insertion of five different connexins into the membrane of the ER was studied by synthesizing connexins in translation-competent cell lysates supplemented with pancreatic ER-derived microsomes, and by expressing connexins in vivo in several eucaryotic cell types. In addition, the subcellular {{distribution of the}} connexins was determined. In vitro-synthesis {{in the presence of}} microsomes resulted in the signal recognition particle-dependent membrane insertion of the connexins. The membrane insertion of all connexins was accompanied by an efficient proteolytic processing that was dependent on the <b>microsom...</b>|$|E

Since the work of Claude (6) on the systematic fractionation of mammalian liver cells by differential centrifugation, much attention has been devoted in many laboratories {{to the study of the}} different fractions isolated by his method. In his early work, Claude demonstrated that most of the ribonucleic acid of the cytoplasm, up to 85 per cent, was associated with the microsome fraction, and he suggested that the microsome material was responsible for the basophilia of the ground substance of the cell (7), a view that has been confirmed by later work (1, 21, 18, 12, 22). A further step was made in our understanding of the origin and constitution of the microsome fraction by the use of the combined methods of differential centrifugation and electron microscopy, when it was shown, first, that the microsome elements represented portions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ergastoplasm), and, second, that the ribonucleic acid found in the microsome pellet was mostly concentrated in granules of small size, about 140 A in diameter, as described by Palade (17); these ribosome particles are found charac-teristically attached to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, and to the isolated <b>microsom...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of the trace elements in the etiology of gastro-intestinal diseases is likely to lead back to two reasons: Firstly to the protective effecting of the trace element containing proteins against the damage of cells by aggressive peroxides. Secondly to a rank of chain reactions with dysfunction of uncorrected expressed proteins. Investigations of cell lines which were incubated with the elements Cu, Mn, Se, Mo, and Zn have shown that some proteins were expressed, which are able to unfold their biological activity if they bind such elements. Additionally, it was also reported by other authors that metalloproteins and metalloid containing proteins {{are involved in the}} metabolisms of the tissues of the digestion tract. The experiments carried out in this thesis and the results obtained are devoted to the digestion tract, a system whose correct function is indispensable for the organism. For the realisation of the experiments concerning the thesis analytical, biochemical, molecular and immunochemical procedures were applied. By means of the INAA, ICP-MS, and AAS the contents of the trace elements As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Rb, Se, Ti, V, and Zn in rat tissues of the digestive tract were examined. A low significant value was observed regarding the total content of Fe by the influence of Se. For other elements a significant effect could not be observed. As a result, after the application of the different analytical methods it could be said that each method is suitable only for some elements. Nevertheless, the ICP-MS should be used at first, because the measurements can be carried out quickly and the results are obtainable very fast. In the case of very low amounts of the samples it is better to take the measurements by means of the INNA for quantitative analysis. By means of the INAA, the concentration and the distribution of the trace elements As, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Rb, Se and Zn were determined in the cell organelles (nuclei, mitichondria, <b>microsoms</b> and cytosol) of several tissues of the intestinal tract. It was proved that the Fe concentration showed significant differences in the microsomes of the tongue and stomach of the Se(-) und Se(+) animals. By the coupling of the laser ablation with the ICP-MS, the qualitative determination concerning the distribution of the elements As, Cd, Cu, Mo, Ni, and V in the subcellular fractions, also with extremely little contents, was very successful. The proteins in the cytosols, which were obtained of the tissues of the rats fed with different selenium concentrations {{as well as of the}} human colon cell-lines HT 29, were determined at first in the cytosols by the online-coupling of the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with the inductively coupling plasma-massenspectrometry. Afterwards, the elements inside the proteins were determined by mass spectrometry. The obtained chromatographic profiles of As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Se, Ti, V, and Zn indicate that the elements above are binding to proteins. This could not be found for Rb and Cs. By means of these results it is assumed that these elements are part of proteins which are still unknown. By the detection of trace elements containing proteins by means of SEC-ICP-MS it was found that the element Mo was bound to the proteins with the molecular mass of 7 kDa and 50 kDa, whereas in the cytosol of the human colon cell-lines the Mo was bound only to the protein with the molecular mass of 7 kDa. As a result of this outcome the cell-line HT 29 was incubated with Mo to find out if the element also binds to proteins with higher molecular masses than 7 kDa. Parallel to this investigation, experiments were carried out with the liver cytosol. The liver cells were fractionated. The proteins in the obtained cytosol were separated by SEC. The resulted protein fractions were analysed with regard to Mo by means of the AAS. In the proteins of the liver cytosol besides the 50 kDa-protein a further Mo containing protein with the molecular mass of 7 kDa was identified. Based of the obtained result the cell lines HT 29 was incubated with Mo to find out if Mo is able to bind to proteins with higher molecular masses. Parallel to this study the organ liver was used as a comparison tissue. By fractionation of the liver cells the cytosol was separated by means of SEC of the total fraction presence of Mo was checked by AAS analysis. In the protein mixture of the liver cytosol it could be detected the Mo-containing protein with the molecular mass of 7 kDa and besides of them the other Mo-containing protein with the molecular mass of 50 kDa was also detected. The analysis of the 7 kda protien by LC/ESI-MS/MS resulted the still unknown protein LOC 500475. The primary structure of this protein is predicted only by theoretical calculation of the amino acids. The identification of the selenoproteins in the homogenates of the gastrointestinal-tract was done by labelling the rats with 75 Se in vivo, separating the proteins by SDS-PAGE, and determining the selenium in the proteins by autoradiography. Thereby, labelled proteins in the homogenate of the (Se-) -rats were detected in the molecular mass range between 10 kDa and 70 kDa. These proteins were also found using the 2 D-electrophoresis distributed in the pI-range between 3. 5 and 9. 0 and molecular masses between 10 kDa and 80 kDa. For the analysis of the expressed proteins the appropriate computer program Melanie 6. 0 provided 35 differences of the expressed proteins in the tongue homogenates of the (Se+) - and (Se-) -rats. 9 of these proteins were expressed significantly higher in the Se(+) -homogenate than in the Se(-) -homogenate. In the homogenate of the stomach 20 differences were found. 12 of these proteinspots were expressed higher in the Se (+) -homogenate. The analysis of the small intestine provided 22 differences of the expressed proteins. 12 of them were expressed higher in the Se (+) -homogenate. In the colon homogenate of the (Se+) and (Se-) - rats 13 differences were observed. 6 of these protein spots were expressed stronger significant in the Se (+) -homogenate. The identification of the protein spots 1 – 3 in the (Se+) -homogenate of the tongue was reached by the MALDI-MS after tryptic digestion of the proteins and comparison of the obtained peptide masses with the theoretical data for peptide masses. Identified were the proteins UDP-Glucose- 6 dehydrogenase (1), Hydroxyl-Coenzym A dehydrogenase (2), and Ubiquitin C-terminale hydrolase isozym L 3 (3). Each of these proteins is involved in the metabolic processes of the gastro intestinal tract. In the stomach homogenate of the Se(+) - und Se(-) -rats the proteins Actin- 2, Prohibitin, cytokeratin 8 as well as the protein FLJ 20729 (Spot 1 - 4) were identified. The latter is up to now only known by in silico investigations. The detection of the metalloproteins as well as of the selenoproteins in the homogenate of the digestion tract was reached by the application of several immunochemical tests. The used antibodies provided positive signals for the proteins SOD, LOX, MT-I and MT-II, plasma GPx (GPx 3), and for the acid 15 kDa-Selenoprotein as well as the new discovered Cu-containing protein DPT. In this thesis with exception of SOD these proteins had been shown to be expressed in the gastro intestinal tract at the first time by means of immunochemical methods...|$|R
