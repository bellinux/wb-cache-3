In each show, Kilborn would conduct celebrity interviews, ending with a segment called [...] "Five Questions" [...] in which the guest was made to answer {{a series of questions}} that were typically a combination of obscure fact and subjective opinion. These are highlighted in a 1998 book titled The Daily Show: Five Questions, which contains transcripts of Kilborn's best interviews. Each episode concluded with a segment called [...] "Your Moment of Zen" [...] that showed random video clips of humorous and sometimes morbid interest such as visitors at a Chinese zoo feeding baby chickens to the alligators. Originally the show was recorded without a studio audience, featuring only the laughter of its own off-camera staff members.

50|$|When Deutsche Post of the GDR {{expanded}} automated {{mail processing}} in the 1980s, {{they did not}} use luminescent tagging, but used sideways illumination to identify {{the shadows of the}} stamp perforation in order to position mail items in cancelling and sorting machinery. Red light was used for this purpose, giving a good contrast to ordinary writing ink colours and enabling <b>machine</b> <b>reading</b> of postcodes. Some issues of Postal cards were printed entirely in orange to facilitate the latter process. However, the colours of the imprinted stamps was later changed to those of the usual definitives of the corresponding value, and simulated perforations were added around the stamp design to help locate the stamp position.|$|E
40|$|A self-reproduction via {{description}} {{is discussed in}} a network model of machines and description tapes. Tapes consist of bit strings, encoding function of machines. A tape is replicated when it is read by an adequate machine. Generally, a machine rewrites a tape without doing correct replication. The variation in a reproduced tape is taken as mutation. Since this mutation {{is caused by a}} machine's program, we call it active mutation. Which machine is translated from a given tape is dependent on what kind of a <b>machine</b> <b>reads</b> the tape. External noise is introduced in <b>machine's</b> <b>reading</b> process to make errors. A new reaction pathway is induced by external noise via machine's error action. We find that the induced pathways will be mimicked deterministically in an emerging core structure. This core structure will be remained stable after turning off external noise.

50|$|The {{identity}} page of {{the passport}} booklet has been moved {{to the front of}} the passport and is now printed on a plastic card. This allows easier <b>machine</b> <b>reading</b> of the passport, as the official has to spend less time finding the identity page in the passport. The top-right corner of the passport booklet contains the biometric chip, which contains a copy of the information contained on the identity page, and a facial scan of the holder. To prevent unauthorised parties remotely accessing the information stored in the RFID biometric chip, the machine readable zone of the identity page must be scanned to unlock it. This safeguard is known as Basic Access Control.|$|E

50|$|It {{uses the}} {{structural}} conventions {{of a normal}} programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than <b>machine</b> <b>reading.</b> Pseudocode typically omits details that are essential for machine understanding of the algorithm, such as variable declarations, system-specific code and some subroutines. The programming language is augmented with natural language description details, where convenient, or with compact mathematical notation. The purpose of using pseudocode {{is that it is}} easier for people to understand than conventional programming language code, and that it is an efficient and environment-independent description of the key principles of an algorithm. It is commonly used in textbooks and scientific publications that are documenting various algorithms, and also in planning of computer program development, for sketching out the structure of the program before the actual coding takes place.|$|E

50|$|In 2001, {{after the}} {{creation}} of a series of struggling inline hockey leagues --Roller Hockey International, Pro Beach Hockey, and Major League Roller Hockey—a longtime inline hockey rink owner, Charley Yoder, and his sons CJ and Jami, had an idea of a professional league for about three years. After RHI started for its second time; and its chances didn't look good, Charles Yoder thought 'There's gotta be a way for it to work'. His sons, CJ and Jami, played in RHI, PBH and MLRH, and every league they played in had a list of things they did wrong so Charley and his sons put it down on paper.

50|$|Big Mechanism - Big {{mechanisms}} are large, explanatory models of complicated systems in which interactions have important causal effects. Whilst {{the collection of}} big data is increasingly automated, the creation of big mechanisms remains a largely human effort, which is becoming made increasingly challenging, according to the fragmentation and distribution of knowledge. The ability to automate the construction of big mechanisms could {{have a major impact}} on scientific research. As one of a number of different projects that make up the big mechanism programme, funded by DARPA, the aim is to assemble an overarching big mechanism from the literature and prior experiments and to utilise this for the probabilistic interpretation of new patient panomics data. We will integrate <b>machine</b> <b>reading</b> of the cancer literature with probabilistic reasoning across cancer claims using specially-designed ontologies, computational modeling of cancer mechanisms (pathways), automated hypothesis generation to extend knowledge of the mechanisms and a 'Robot Scientist' that performs experiments to test the hypotheses. A repetitive cycle of text mining, modelling, experimental testing, and worldview updating is intended to lead to increased knowledge about cancer mechanisms.|$|E
