The film's spokesperson told IANS that most of the film would be shot in Kerala, at locations similar to the original, except for a few scenes.

Palpation of the ankle can determine the degree of swelling. Assessment includes {{a check of the}} popliteal, femoral, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses. The inguinal nodes may be enlarged.

25|$|In {{a motion}} made on December 15, 2006, defense {{attorneys}} {{argued that the}} DNA analysis report written by DSI and provided to them by Nifong's office was incomplete, because it omitted information showing {{that none of the}} genetic material from several men found on Mangum matched any DNA sample from the lacrosse team. Brian Meehan, the director of DSI who wrote the misleading report, testified that his lab did not try to withhold information, but acknowledged that the decision not to release the full report violated the lab's policies. Meehan testified that after discussions with Nifong, he decided to withhold the names of the persons excluded by the DNA testing (all 46 tested members of the lacrosse team), {{in order to protect the}} privacy of players not implicated in the case, despite the fact that two players (Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty) had already been indicted for rape <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> prior to the release date of the report.

25|$|The 2007 {{pet food}} recalls {{comprise}} the contamination and wide recall of many brands of {{cat and dog}} foods beginning in March 2007, and the ensuing developments involving the human food supply. The recalls in North America, Europe, and South Africa came in response to reports of renal failure in pets. Initially, the recalls {{were associated with the}} consumption of mostly wet pet foods made with wheat gluten from a single Chinese company. After <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> of complaints from consumers, the recall began voluntarily with the Canadian company Menu Foods on 16 March 2007, when a company test showed sickness and death in some of the test animals. Soon after, there were numerous media reports of animal deaths as a result of kidney failure. In the following weeks, several other companies who received the contaminated wheat gluten also voluntarily recalled dozens of pet food brands. One month after the initial recall, contaminated rice protein from a different source in China was also identified as being associated with kidney failure in pets in the United States, while contaminated corn gluten was associated with kidney failure with pets in South Africa. As a result of investigating the 2007 pet food recalls, a broader Chinese protein export contamination investigation unfolded, raising concerns about the safety of the human food supply.|$|E
25|$|When the Russians besieged the Chechen capital, {{thousands}} of civilians {{died from a}} week-long series of air raids and artillery bombardments in the heaviest bombing campaign in Europe since the destruction of Dresden. The initial assault on New Year's Eve 1995 ended in a major Russian defeat, resulting in heavy casualties and at first nearly a complete breakdown of morale in the Russian forces. The disaster {{claimed the lives of}} an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 Russian soldiers, mostly barely trained and disoriented conscripts; the heaviest losses were inflicted on the 131st 'Maikop' Motor Rifle Brigade, which was completely destroyed in the fighting near the central railway station. Despite the early Chechen defeat of the New Year's assault and the many further casualties that the Russians had sustained, Grozny was eventually conquered by Russian forces amidst bitter urban warfare. After armored assaults failed, the Russian military set out to take the city using air power and artillery. At the same time, the Russian military accused the Chechen fighters of using civilians as human shields by preventing them from leaving the capital as it came under continued bombardment. On 7 January 1995, Russian Major-General Viktor Vorobyov was killed by mortar fire, becoming the first on a long list of Russian generals to be killed in Chechnya. On 19 January, despite heavy casualties, Russian forces seized the ruins of the Chechen presidential palace, which had been heavily contested for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> as the Chechens finally abandoned their positions in the destroyed downtown area.

First a course of RICE (Rest, ice, compression, elevation) is typically coupled with NSAIDS (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) to help alleviate pain and swelling. When the swelling has subsided, individual exercises or physical therapy may be prescribed to strengthen muscles around the elbow joint to compensate for tearing in the UCL ligament.

40|$|Objective The study {{aimed to}} detail the {{lifestyle}} (physical activity and dietary habits) of Moroccan adolescents. Design Cross-sectional study {{undertaken in the}} framework of the ATLS (Arab Teens Lifestyle Study). Setting Physical activity and dietary habits were determined using a validated questionnaire in public secondary schools. Subjects A total of 669 adolescents aged 15 簭 19 繠years were randomly recruited from Kenitra, Morocco. Results Physical activity patterns and intensity differed between genders. As anticipated, male adolescents were <b>more</b> active <b>than</b> female adolescents across a typical week and engaged in more vigorous-intensity physical activity than female adolescents, who spent <b>more</b> time <b>than</b> male adolescents in moderate-intensity physical activity. Of particular concern was that one in five of the adolescents surveyed was inactive, with almost 45 % of the sample reporting television viewing for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 2 h/d and 38 % engaged in computer use for a similar period. From a dietary perspective, most adolescents reported that they do not take breakfast or consume milk and dairy products, fruits and vegetables on a daily basis. In contrast, most reported consumption of doughnuts, cakes, candy and chocolate <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> times per <b>week</b> and approximately 50 % consumed sugary drinks <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> times per <b>week.</b> Conclusions Based on a continuation of the self-reported lifestyle behaviours, adolescents in the present study are at risk of developing chronic diseases. Education programmes are urgently needed to assist in the promotion of a healthy lifestyle and reduce the likelihood of overweight and obesity and related health risks among young people.
