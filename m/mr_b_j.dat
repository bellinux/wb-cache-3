40|$|Investigations in {{the field}} of wood {{hydrolysis}} at the University of Tasmania were planned in a general way by Professor E. E. Kurth in 1940 - 41 and laboratory work was commenced in 1942 by B. J. Ralph B. Sc. and A. B. Wardrop M. Sc. They published a paper on the dilute acid autoclaving of e. obliqua in the April 1946 idition of the Journal of the Australian Chemical Institute. The investigations carried out since February 1944 are described in this paper. In 1944 M. H. R. Shipp B. Sc. and D. H. Foster B. Sc. continued the work on wood hydrolysis under the direction of <b>Mr.</b> <b>B.</b> <b>J</b> 4 Ralph.. Whereas previous experiments had been confined to an autoclave the hydrolytic process was now carried out in a percolator in which dilute acid was passed continuously through the wood. They made a preliminary investigation on the effect of the variables of temperature and time on the hydrolysis of a sample of e. obliqua. In 1945 Shipp and 0. G. Ingles B. Sc. modified the percolator, and under the direction of <b>Mr.</b> <b>B.</b> <b>J.</b> Ralph they performed experimental work on the investigation of the effect of temperature, strength of acid, time and rate of acid flow on the hydrolysis of e. obliqua. These results were interpreted by Foster and are presented in this paper. Foster returned to the work on wood hydrolysis in February 1946 after an absence of twelve months in the R. A. A. F. He investigated the hydrolysis of eleven different Tasmanian woods under the direction of Prof. E. E.

An extensive agro-climatic database for sub-Saharan Africa is being assembled at ILCA with the help of African governments and international organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Research results from a particular site can be expected to be applicable to other areas with similar AEZs and this will help to speed up the process of transferring research results from the research station to the farmer. According to ILCA, more precisely defined environmental conditions will enable increased use of computer modelling to predict pasture, forage and crop responses to the environment, thereby reducing the need for multi-location adaptation trials.

Number of runs 27 Running time 173 hours Liquid helium produced 364 liters Experiments serviced 116 Reduction of Cool-Down Time. The number of experiments serviced stimulated an effort to reduce the cool-down time. By using the auxiliary liquefying pot as a liquid air precooling line, in addition to the usual radiation shield line, the cool-down time was reduced to one hour.

40|$|Two large {{specimens}} of a hitherto unknown species of neotropical catfish {{have recently been}} found dead and washed ashore beneath the dike along the Westerscheldt near Biezelinge, Zeeland, at a mutual distance of approximately 300 meters. Both were in excellent condition and have been presented to the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie at Leiden by <b>Mr.</b> <b>B.</b> <b>J.</b> J. R. Walrecht. A superficial examination already disclosed {{the fact that the}} two specimens belong to the (sub) genus Selenaspis, a well known group of catfishes inhabiting the salt and brackish shores and estuaries of {{the northern part of the}} South American continent. Some of the species are known to spawn in fresh water. The present specimens must have been transported by ship. Whether they have been thrown overboard dead or alive remains uncertain though the first possibility seems more plausible. The damaged and fringed condition of the fins indicates a period of drifting along the shore, while the length of this period is limited by the still rather fresh condition, especially of the larger and first collected specimen. On the other hand, putrefaction seems to be slow in this group of fishes. On his request, Mr. Walrecht received the information that no recent shipment of South American aquarium fishes had arrived at the aquarium of the Antwerp Zoological Garden. An investigation of the stomachs of the two specimens gave the following results. In the larger specimen, no remains of food were found; in the second specimen, the stomach contained a considerable quantity of remains, viz., a part of a rib, possibly from a pig, measuring 1. 8 by 5 cm; several pieces of cartilage; numerous split peas; several small remains of plant...|$|E

40|$|State housing {{areas are}} an {{accepted}} and typical {{part of the}} New Zealand urban landscape. However, {{little research has been}} carried out on this topic and existing findings in the disciplines of geography, sociology, education and architecture are largely unrelated. The need for further and more intensive investigation has been stressed by Pool in his study of the areal groupings of the social characteristics of inhabitants of the Auckland urban area. Pool defined State housing areas as one of his ten 'social regions' and concluded that "State suburbs are unique and their character and problems require separate research". 1 Pool, 1959 (a), 115. This thesis aims to investigate the physical characteristics of a state housing suburb and the demographic and social characteristics of its residents. The hypothesis will be explored that within a suburb planned by the State, different policies on housing administration have led to different demographic patterns. The name 'Takaro' is applied loosely and inconsistently by residents in Palmerston North to a wide area {{to the west of the}} city. For the purposes of this thesis Takaro is defined as the part on the outskirts of the city that was planned as an entity by the Housing Division of the Ministry of Works, also including Monrad Street as a boundary (Figure 3). Takaro covers an area of 287 acres and contained in August 1969 an estimated 3, 368 people. It is a relatively new housing suburb, for the main period of building construction was between 1959 and 1966. The majority of houses are State-built (52 per cent) or State-financed group houses (22 per cent). The remaining private houses include a number built for the Department of Maori Affairs. This study consists of a survey and an analysis of findings and their implications. The basic research tool was an interview survey carried out in order to gain information related to the aims of the thesis. The nature of the survey and the methods used are detailed in Appendix A. The work is in three parts. The first establishes the legislative setting, in which the introduction of State housing in New Zealand, its growth and development are outlined. The second consists of the study of Takaro, its physical growth and structure, and of the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the residents and their patterns of community interaction. In the third part the implications of State policies are discussed upon the basis of research findings and suggestions are made for future policies. The author is grateful for the supervision and encouragement of Professor K. W. Thomson and Mr B. G. R. Saunders of the Geography Department, Massey University.
