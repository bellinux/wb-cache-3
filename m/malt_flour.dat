50|$|On {{the same}} day, another {{reduction}} of food took place: the workers received 500 grams of bread; employees and children, 300 grams; and dependants, 250 grams. Rations {{of meat and}} groats were also reduced, but the issue of sugar, confectionery and fats was increased instead. The army and the Baltic Fleet had some emergency rations, but these were not sufficient, and were used up in weeks. The flotilla of Lake Ladoga was not well equipped for war, and was almost destroyed in bombing by the German Luftwaffe. Several barges with grain were sunk in Lake Ladoga in September 1941 alone. A significant part of that grain, however, was later recovered from the water by divers. This grain was delivered to Leningrad at night, and was used for baking bread. When the city ran out of reserves of <b>malt</b> <b>flour,</b> other substitutes, such as finished cellulose and cotton-cake, were used. Oats meant for horses were also used, while the horses were fed wood leaves.|$|E
50|$|Kusel station owed its {{importance}} to freight transport, {{especially for the}} local industry and the Unteroffizier-Krüger Barracks. Sometimes it served troop trains to the neighbouring Baumholder military training area. In 1905, it received or dispatched a total of 35,495.11 tons of freight. The station mainly received bricks, limestone, <b>malt,</b> <b>flour,</b> iron and other fertilizers, cement, gypsum and lime. It shipped mainly wire and wire nails, cereal and beer. In 1920, a local freight train (Nahgüterzug) ran from Kaiserslautern to Kusel and another ran between Altenglan and Kusel. A through freight train (Durchgangsgüterzug) ran from Kaiserslautern to Kusel. After the Second World War, revenue declined steadily. Until the mid-1960s, the stations of Thallichtenberg and Pfeffelbach along the line to Türkismühle were served by a freight exchange train (Übergabegüterzug) from Kusel. In the 1990s, it was served only by a freight exchange train between Kaiserslautern-Einsiedlerhof station on the Mannheim-Saarbrücken line and Kusel. Now, the station has no freight operations and its freight tracks have been dismantled.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} of liquid smoke to food {{has grown to}} encompass {{a wide variety of}} methods employing thousands of commercial formulations worldwide. By far the widest use of liquid smoke is for the purpose of replacing direct smoking of food with onsite-generated smoke from wood. To impart the desired functional effects of smoke, liquid smoke preparations must be applied topically. In addition to flavor, reaction color, anti-microbial, and texture effects are the functionalities that can only be obtained by topical addition followed by thermal processing. Dipping products in diluted solutions or soaking them in brines containing liquid smoke followed by heating was done long before the modern industrial era using Wright’s liquid smoke and pyroligneous acid precursors. Allen patented a method of regenerating smoke using air atomization. It remains the leading technology for using condensed smoke products to treat processed meat, cheese, fish, and other foods in batch smokehouses. As the meat-processing industry has consolidated, continuous processes have evolved and direct applications of solutions of liquid smoke via showering or drenching systems installed on continuous lines have grown to be the largest type of application method. In North America there are more than thirty-five processed-meat plants utilizing bulk tanks to receive tankers of liquid smoke for topical application as an alternative to direct wood smoking. Also noteworthy is the method of topical application by impregnation of fibrous, laminated, and plastic casings. Meat products are subsequently stuffed into these casings and thermally processed. The use of natural condensed smoke preparations internally in food is another important means of imparting smoke flavor. It is used when other technical functions of smoke are not imperative to be expressed in a finished food. This can be done directly by adding into blenders with meat or other foods or injecting whole muscle meat. Incorporation into sauces such as barbeque or dry seasonings and compounding with other flavors are other important ways in which the flavors are used. Further utility of aqueous smoke solutions is gained by the use of more complex food-grade processing such as extraction into oil, spray drying using maltodextrin carriers, or plating onto foods and food ingredients such as <b>malt</b> <b>flour,</b> yeast, or salt.|$|E

Samples (n = 60) were sourced from commercial and experimental barley grain varieties and their corresponding malts. The fructan content in grain and <b>malt</b> <b>flour</b> was determined using the enzymatic kit from Megazyme (K-FRUC, Megazyme International Ireland). Samples were scanned in a MIR instrument using an ATR single bounce cell (Bruker Optics, Germany). The coefficients of determination in cross-validation (R 2) and the standard error of cross-validation (SECV) obtained for the prediction of the fructan content in the calibration set were 0. 76 and 0. 20 %, respectively. The residual predictive deviation (RPD = SD/SECV) value obtained was 2. 3, indicating that these calibrations can be used for qualitative determination of the fructan content (e. g. low, medium and high) in the set of samples analysed. This study showed that ATR-MIR spectroscopy might be used as approximate estimates of the true fructan concentration in barley and malt in order to rank samples (low, medium, high) in the context of a breeding program.

Pita breads were made from either 100 % baker's flour (control) or 50 % <b>malt</b> <b>flour,</b> whole-grain flour, or flour from barley grains pearled at 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % grain weight. Antioxidant capacity and vitamin E content of flours and pitas were determined by their ability to scavenge 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radicals and high performance liquid chromatography, respectively. The physical and sensory properties of the pitas were also assessed. All pitas made from either whole grain or pearled barley flour had a higher antioxidant capacity and most also had higher vitamin E content than standard pita. The antioxidant and vitamin E levels were reduced in pearled compared to whole grains, however the extent of that reduction varied among genotypes.

40|$|The supplementing {{of wheat}} flour with enzyme {{preparations}} containing amylases, proteinases and lipoxygenase {{has been widely}} adopted in mills and bakeries. While the three enzymes are present in sound wheat, they normally occur in levels insuf-ficient to produce optimal technological effects. In milling sound, mature wheat these enzyme are retained in low levels and the flour is fortified with controlled amounts of enzyme (R�� � 1975). Since wheat flour contains an adequate amount of native β-amylase, the supplementation of flour with amylase aims at an increase in α-amylase activity. Originally, <b>malted</b> barley <b>flour</b> was used to this aim, than it was replaced by <b>malted</b> wheat <b>flour</b> and recently by fungal α-amylase. <b>Malt</b> <b>flours</b> are relatively rich sources of mal-tose, minerals, soluble proteins, amylolytic and proteolytic enzymes, and flavour substances, which promote vigorous yeast activity, accelerate dough conditioning and contribute a distinctive flavour and aroma to the baked product (F����� 1985). The principal functional benefits of the malt addition include an increased gas production in the dough, an improved crust colour formation, a better crumb moisture retention, and an enhanced flavour development. Malt α-amylases acting on damaged starch gran-ules rectify the deficiency of fermentable sugar which is necessary for optimal yeast growth and gas production (P��� � et al. 1994).

40|$|The possibililty {{of using}} the simple {{technologies}} of malting and fermentation to modify endogenously the sorghum grain components, to alleviate the grittiness, dryness and high crumb firmness caused by the inclusion of sorghum flour in composite bread, was investigated. The most suitable grain and the optimal malting time for sorghum for bread¬making, were selected by malting five sorghum cultivars, up to 8 days, and evaluating them for the highest protein modification and lowest dry matter losses. On that basis, a 6 ¬days malt of Local White, a relatively high protein sorghum (10. 7 %), was selected. Sorghum <b>malt</b> <b>flour</b> potentially suitable for bread-making was produced by boiling the selected malt, rather than drying it at high temperatures, stewing or steaming. Boiling was most effective in inactivating the amylases and in increasing the pasting viscosity of sorghum malt. The bread made with boiled <b>malt</b> <b>flour</b> (30 %) had an improved crumb structure and water-holding capacity, a softer crumb and increased resistance to staling, compared to bread made with sorghum grain flour (30 %). Bread-making with reconstituted flours from flour and bran fractions of whole sorghum grain and whole boiled sorghum malt indicated that the bread improving effect of malting and boiling was due to dextrinization and gelatinization of starch, and to the increase of total and water-soluble pentosans, and crude fiber. Dextrinization and gelatinization of starch decreased the gelatinization temperature {{and the rate of}} starch retrogradation, thus decreasing the crumb firmness and firming rate of sorghum and wheat composite bread. However, high levels of gelatinized starch decreased dough strength and bread volume. The increase of total pentosans and crude fiber of sorghum malts, caused by germinating grains roots and shoots growth, and the increase of water-soluble pentosans, due to hydrolysis of the non-starch polyssacharides during malting, significantly increased flour and dough water-holding capacity. Thus, crumb structure was improved and crumb firmness and crumb-firming rate decreased. Treatment of sorghum flour with endo-(l- 4) -β-xylanase to determine whether endoxylanases could solubilize sorghum pentosans, increased the water-soluble pentosans slightly, indicating the potential of endoxylanases to improve the bread-making quality of sorghum flour. However, heating the endoxylanase treated flour to inactivate the enzyme, so as to determine its specific effect, gelatinized the starch and decreased the bread volume. A natural lactic acid fermentation of sorghum flour, followed by drying at 60 °C, decreased the pH of sorghum flour from 6. 2 to 3. 4 and slightly increased the gelatinized starch and the pasting viscosity of sorghum flour. Apparently, the low pH caused higher loaf volume and improved crumb structure and softness by suppressing the amylases and by increasing the viscosity of dough, and hence increasing its gas-holding capacity. Adding wet fermented sorghum flour directly to wheat flour (sourdough process), as an alternative to drying, further increased the volume and decreased the crumb firmness. Fermentation and drying also improved the protein digestibility of sorghum composite bread. Consumer panel members liked the bread made with boiled sorghum <b>malt</b> <b>flour</b> most, apparently because it was softer, more moist and had a fine malt flavor. They liked the bread made with fern 1 ented and dried sorghum flour less, apparently because it had a pronounced sour taste. Malting and fermentation can be successfully used to produce acceptable sorghum and wheat composite bread. Fermentation is probably the most suitable technology for poor developing countries because it is simple and effective. Steaming the malt and adding the endoxylanases directly when mixing the dough, to eliminate the flour drying step and to reduce starch gelatinization, should be looked at further.

The whole grains of a local rice variety (Oryza sativa L. subsp. indica var. Mottaikaruppan) were steeped in distilled water (12 h, 30 °C) and germinated for 3 days to obtain high content of soluble materials and amylase activity in bread making. The quality of bread was evaluated by considering the physical and sensorial parameters. When the wheat flour was substituted with <b>malted</b> rice <b>flour,</b> 35 % substitution level and the <b>malted</b> rice <b>flour</b> from 3 days of germination was the best according to the physical and sensory qualities of bread. The quality of bread was improved by the addition of 20 g of margarine, 20 g of baking powder and 20 g of yeast in 1 kg of flour.

Kernel heterogeneity can lead to brewhouse problems and a product with unpredictable nitrogen and fermentable sugar content. The variability between individual grains of important malting characteristics was measured in malt samples produced under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Various parameters (including germinative energy, germinative capacity, moisture content, β-glucanase activity, friability and homogeneity) were measured {{to ensure that the}} 5 d aerobic Optic malt, produced in Heriot-Watt university micromaltings, was viable and of commercial quality. The 5 d aerobic malt kernels produced at Simpsons Maltings in Berwick-Upon- Tweed were heavier than the micromalt. Commercially produced malt kernels had higher levels of fermentable sugars and soluble nitrogen than the micromalt despite lower α-amylase, β-amylase and ‘total’ limit dextrinase activity. Differences between the 5 d aerobic micromalt and the 5 d aerobic commercially produced malt are indicative of why micromalting cannot always be used as a model system for what is happening industrially and must be modelled on commercial practice. Subjecting 5 d aerobic micromalt to 24 h anaerobic incubation resulted in increased levels of fermentable sugars per l wort. 24 h anoxia also resulted in increased α-amylase and limit dextrinase activities. There are potential industrial applications for this anaerobic wort.

Six steps are considered for the analysis: (1) culture of barley, malting, grinding and transport to the brewery; (2) brewing of <b>malt</b> <b>flour</b> and water in two steps; (3) boiling wort; (4) guard of the beer at 4 °C during 25 days; (5) packaging in brown glass bottle of 33 cl with a crown cap chrome steel or in stainless steel keg of 20 l and then (6) washing of spent grain recovered after brewing. The functional unit is taken as the production of 1 litre of beer. Environmental impacts have been evaluated using the ReCiPe 2008 method with the endpoint hierarchist perspective. Four packaging scenarios are compared: single use bottle and keg, reused bottle (average 9. 2 times) and keg (average 53. 5 times). The results show that the most penalizing step is packaging, for single use scenarios, contributing to 86 % of the environmental impact for the keg and 72 % for the bottle. For the reuse scenarios, it’s the culture of barley which is the most penalizing step with contribution between 57 % and 70 %. The production of beer remains low with maximum 20 % of contribution.

40|$|Traditional Malawian diets are {{predominantly}} maize-based {{and have been}} associated with widespread inadequate intakes of several nutrients. In addition to maize, legumes are an important source of protein and other nutrients in diets of many people in developing countries. Soybeans have the highest protein content among legumes and when consumed together with cereals, a high quality protein is provided because cereals and legumes are complementary in terms of limiting amino acids. However, soybean utilization in Malawi is minimal due to limited knowledge in processing. In an effort to increase utilization and consumption of soybeans by all age groups in Malawi, solid-state fermented pastes of soybeans and soybean-maize blends were developed. The fermented pastes were to be used as relish and to serve as major sources of protein in maizebased diets. Spontaneous solid state fermentation of soybeans favors growth of Bacillus subtilis, a highly proteolytic organism that produces high amount of ammonia. High ammonia levels result in strong odor which some people find objectionable. On the other hand, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are weakly proteolytic and do not lead to accumulation of high levels of organoleptically unpleasant metabolic products.

The enzyme was produced constitutively when the microorganism was cultured in M 162 medium supplemented with either starch, cellobiose, carboxymethylcellulose, sucrose, glucose, galactose, Avicel, lactose, mannose or maltose as carbon sources. The Bacillus subtilis CHZ 1 was found to produce hydrolytic extracellular enzymes when cultured on a medium extracted from opaque beer brewery wastewater supplemented with defatted soya, spent yeast and <b>malt</b> <b>flour.</b> The medium from the food waste materials was named CWW medium. Elimination of one raw material component during CWW medium preparation revealed that all the components were essential for maximum enzyme production. The absence of spent yeast during CWW medium preparation greatly reduced the levels of enzyme production. In addition, the microorganism produced endoglucanase, amylase, polygalacturonase, xylanase and protease when cultured on CWW medium. All assayed enzymes reached high levels within 5 â€“ 10 h during fermentation at 40 ÂºC and pH maintained at 6. 0 in fermentor experiments. A cultivation temperature of 50 ÂºC resulted in a rapid drop in all the enzyme levels after 12 h of cultivation. High biomass and enzyme levels were obtained in fermentor cultivations compared to shake flask experiments. This showed that food wastes could be used to produce hydrolytic enzymes from B. subtilis CHZ 1. A proteolytic enzyme produced by a B. subtilis CHZ 1 was purified using ammonium sulphate precipitation, gel filtration and cationic exchange on S-Sepharose fast flow column chromatography. Production of the protease enzyme was higher when the Bacillus strain was cultured in a synthetic medium, M 162, supplemented with 0. 3...|$|E
50|$|Aarhus Mill {{was built}} {{at some point}} in the early Middle Age. The exact date is not known but it is {{mentioned}} for the first time in records from 1289 and later in 1581 when a new mill was built. The mill was built on the Aarhus river west of Aarhus and east of Brabrand Lake and was mainly used for <b>malt</b> and <b>flour</b> production. In the later Middle Age it became illegal to mill products privately and farmers were forced to use one of the official, royally recognized mills, including Århus Mill.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} effects of malting and fermentation methods on the amounts of sugars and proteins in food grade Macia and Red tannin sorghum flours. Measurements to determine the amounts of reducing sugars, soluble protein, and free amino acids, in sorghum flour samples were performed. Grain sorghum kernels (5. 2 kg) from each sorghum variety were cleaned and kernel hardness tested using Tangential Abrasive Decortication Device (TADD). Half of the kernels (2. 6 kg) were milled to get regular (Rg) flour samples and the other half (2. 6 kg) were malted and milled to get <b>malted</b> (mal). <b>flour</b> samples. About 300 g of both regular (Rg) and <b>malted</b> (mal) <b>flour</b> samples from both sorghum cultivars (in duplicate) were fermented, dried and milled again to get regular and fermented (Rgfe) and malted and fermented (malfe) flour samples. Extracts were prepared for all (8) flour samples by weighing about 0. 5 g of flour into centrifuge tubes, then 10 ml of water was added, vortexes 3 times, boiled for 15 min and then centrifuged at 5250 RCF for 10 min. The reducing sugars in the extracted material of the regular, fermented, <b>malted</b> and malted/fermented <b>flours</b> from both food grade white Macia and the red tannin sorghum samples were determined by the (DNS) colorimetric methods with glucose as the standard and the absorbance values were read at 540 mm (Miller, 1959). The quantitative measurement of free amino acids of the supernatant material from all flour samples from both the food grade white macia and red tannin sorghum samples were performed using the ninhydrin reaction (Plummer, 1978). The amounts of soluble proteins in the supernatant material were measured using the Lowry method (Lowry et al, 1951). Results showed an increase in reducing sugars, soluble proteins and free amino acids in the <b>malted</b> and fermented <b>flour</b> samples compared to the control or regular <b>flour</b> samples, respectively. <b>Malting</b> and fermentation resulted in increased amounts of reducing sugars, soluble proteins and free amino acids in both food grade Macia and Red tannins sorghum flour. Statistical analysis results showed a significant (p 0. 05) difference between the two sorghum varieties (Macia and Red sorghum). Malting and fermentation may be used to improve the nutritional quality of sorghum food products...|$|R
