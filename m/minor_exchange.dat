50|$|The {{exchange}} in chess {{refers to a}} situation in which one player loses a minor piece (i.e. a bishop or knight) but captures the opponent's rook. The side which wins the rook is said to have won the exchange, while the other player has lost the exchange, since the rook is usually more valuable. Alternatively, the side that has won the rook is up the exchange, and the other player is down the exchange. The opposing captures often happen on consecutive moves, although this is not strictly necessary. It is generally detrimental to lose the exchange, although occasionally one may find reason to purposely do so; the result is an exchange sacrifice (see below).

Our experiments with online chatroom conversations show good results in automatically classifying chatlines into various grooming stages. Such a deeper understanding and tracking of predatory behaviour is vital for building robust systems for detecting grooming conversations and potential predators on social media...|$|R

50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of 111, access to emergency services was complicated. For the quarter of New Zealand’s then 414,000 telephone subscribers that were still on manual exchanges, one would simply pick up the telephone and ask the answering operator for the police, ambulance, or fire service by name. However, the problem was on manual exchanges the calls were answered first-come-first-served, which meant on busy exchanges, emergency calls could be delayed. For automatic exchanges, one would need to look up the local police, ambulance or fire service’s telephone number in the telephone directory, know the number by heart, or dial the toll operator {{and ask them to}} place the call. The problem was that the numbers were different for each exchange, and again, {{there was no way to}} tell emergency calls apart from regular calls.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of financial centers focuses {{mainly on the}} competition between and changing roles of the major places. In the European context thus usually London, Paris, Frankfurt/Main and other national financial centers have become objects of investigation. The findings show that the recent reorganisation of financial centers in Europe under the conditions of widespread use of ICT {{with the possibility of}} remote access to exchanges, the development of innovative products on financial markets, and the advent of a single currency affects structures, organisation and specialization of the main actors within financial centers, i. e. banks and exchanges. The planned but failed merger between London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B 6 rse AG in Frankfurt/Main in 2000 has probably been one of the publicly most noticed aspects of this development. The proposed paper wants to put a focus on less prominent features of current restructuring, namely the roles and strategies of <b>minor</b> German <b>exchanges.</b> The main idea is, that - although financial services are characterized by a spread of "de-spatialized" forms of service production-, strategies of regional development based (at least partly) on endogenous resources can be supported by regional financial institutions. The argument will be presented in three steps: At first the importance of a regional exchange for regional development has to be discussed on a theoretical base. This part will draw upon notions and considerations of the "glocalization" literature which stresses the ambivalent relationship between processes of globalization and disembedding {{on the one hand and}} re-interpretation of different forms of proximity (including spatial proximity) on the other hand. A second - also rather theoretical - part will consider the possible comparative advantages of <b>minor</b> <b>exchanges</b> in the context of the prevailing concentration processes. This section will therefore focus on possible strategies, which combine the access to highly liquid and innovative exchanges and the special regional knowledge available at regional institutions. The chances and risks of different strategies (alliances with strong national and/or international partners vs. "niche production") have to be discussed. In the third section the empirical findings of the {{analysis of}} different <b>minor</b> German <b>exchanges</b> situated in metropolitan regions (Berlin, Hamburg, Munich) will be presented and assessed according to the arguments developed in the preceeding parts.

40|$|Protein-protein {{interactions}} are often mediated by flexible loops that experience conformational dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scales. NMR relaxation studies can map these dynamics. However, defining {{the network of}} inter-converting conformers that underlie the relaxation data remains generally challenging. Here, we combine NMR relaxation experiments with simulation to visualize networks of inter-converting conformers. We demonstrate our approach with the apo Pin 1 -WW domain, for which NMR has revealed conformational dynamics of a flexible loop in the millisecond range. We sample and cluster the free energy landscape using Markov State Models (MSM) with major and <b>minor</b> <b>exchange</b> states with high correlation with the NMR relaxation data and low NOE violations. These MSM are hierarchical ensembles of slowly interconverting, metastable macrostates and rapidly interconverting microstates. We found a low population state that consists primarily of holo-like conformations and is a "hub" visited by most pathways between macrostates. These results suggest that conformational equilibria between holo-like and alternative conformers pre-exist in the intrinsic dynamics of apo Pin 1 -WW. Analysis using MutInf, a mutual information method for quantifying correlated motions, reveals that WW dynamics not only {{play a role in}} substrate recognition, but also may help couple the substrate binding site on the WW domain to the one on the catalytic domain.

40|$|We {{present in}} this work the study of small 4 He N-Cs 2 (3 Σu) {{aggregates}} (2 ≥ N ≥ 30) through combined variational, diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC), and path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) calculations. The full surface is modeled as an addition of He-Cs 2 interactions and He-He potentials. Given the negligible strength and large range of the He-Cs 2 interaction {{as compared with the}} one for He-He, a propensity of the helium atoms to pack themselves together, leaving outside the molecular dopant is to be expected. DMC calculations determine the onset of helium gathering at N = 3. To analyze energetic and structural properties as a function of N, PIMC calculations with no bosonic exchange, i. e., Boltzmann statistics, at low temperatures are carried out. At T = 0. 1 K, although acceptable one-particle He-Cs 2 distributions are obtained, two-particle He-He distributions are not well described, indicating that the proper symmetry should be taken into account. PIMC distributions at T = 1 K already compare well with DMC ones and show <b>minor</b> <b>exchange</b> effects, although binding energies are still far from having converged {{in terms of the number}} of quantum beads. As N increases, the He-He PIMC pair correlation function shows a clear tendency to coincide with the experimental boson-liquid helium one at that temperature.

In this study, 195 novel isolates, obtained from seawater and major benthic organisms (rhodoliths and corals), were compared {{with a collection of}} 580 isolates previously characterized (available at www. taxvibrio. lncc. br). The isolates were distributed in 8 major habitat spectra according to AdaptML analysis on the basis of pyrH phylogenetic reconstruction and ecological information, such as isolation source (i. e., corals: Madracis decactis, Mussismilia braziliensis, M. hispida, Phyllogorgia dilatata, Scolymia wellsi; zoanthids: Palythoa caribaeorum, P. variabilis and Zoanthus solanderi; fireworm: Hermodice carunculata; rhodolith; water and sediment) and sampling site regions (SPSPA, AB and SS). Ecologically distinct groups were discerned through AdaptML, which finds phylogenetic groups that are significantly different in their spectra of habitat preferences. Some habitat spectra suggested ecological specialization, with habitat spectra 2, 3, and 4 corresponding to specialization on SPSPA, AB, and SS, respectively. This match between habitat and location may reflect a <b>minor</b> <b>exchange</b> of Vibrio populations between geographically isolated benthic systems. Moreover, we found several widespread Vibrio species predominantly from water column, and different populations of a single Vibrio species from H. carunculata in ecologically distinct groups (H- 1 and H- 8 respectively).

The ecological grouping observed suggests dispersal and connectivity between the benthic and pelagic systems in AB.

40|$|Tourmaline is {{the most}} {{abundant}} borosilicate in the Earth’s crust and the ratio of its two B isotopes (¹¹B/¹⁰B) helps to unravel the source and evolution of fluids during metamorphic, magmatic and hydrothermal processes. For example, tourmaline is a common accessory mineral in the metasedimentary Pfitsch Formation located in the Pfitscher Joch area in the western TauernWindow (Alps). Here, tourmaline crystals show successively decreasing B isotope ratios from their cores to their rims. In combination with whole rock B isotope data and a Rayleigh fractionation model it is shown that the B-isotope signatures in tourmaline are most easily explained by the internal redistribution of B from a B-rich precursor mineral (e. g. mica) to the tourmaline. The reliable interpretation of B isotope patterns in natural tourmaline requires knowledge about the B isotope fractionation between tourmaline and fluid (∆¹¹Btur-fluid). Up to date, experimental studies only considered tourmaline with B in trigonal coordination ([3]B), but many natural tourmalines incorporate excess B at the tetrahedrally coordinated T site ([4]B). In this study, ∆¹¹Btur-fluid values are determined {{as a function of}} [4]B-content in tourmaline based on tourmaline syntheses experiments at high pressures of 4. 0 GPa and temperatures of 700 °C using a piston-cylinder apparatus. Olenitic tourmaline rich in [4]B [∼ 2. 5 atoms per formula unit (pfu) ] has been synthesized in the system SiO₂-Al₂O₃-B₂O₃-NaCl-H₂O. Applying time dependent experiments it is shown that these form via a non-classical crystallization pathway involving jeremejevite as a precursor phase. Rossmanitic tourmaline with lower amounts of [4]B (∼ 0. 6 pfu) has been synthesized in the system Li₂O-SiO₂-Al₂O₃-B₂O₃-H₂O. The mechanism for the incorporation of B at the T site follows TSi- 1 VO- 1 TB 1 V(OH) 1 as the main and X - 1 TSi- 1 XNa 1 TB 1 as a <b>minor</b> <b>exchange</b> vector. Raman spectroscopy has been successfully applied for the chemical characterization of synthetic tourmaline, including the quantification of [4]B concentrations and the first-time detection of Li at the X site. To derive ∆¹¹Btur-fluid as a function of [4]B, B isotope ratios of the synthetic olenitic tourmaline have been determined by spatially resolved secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), whereas the B isotope ratios of coexisting fluids have been measured via multi-collector plasma source mass spectroscopy. Most accurate SIMS data were obtained using a natural olenite from the Koralpe as a novel reference material, pointing towards the need of matrix matched reference material for SIMS B-isotope analysis of tourmaline. The results showthat if 10 mol% of the total B occur in tetrahedral coordination, the ∆¹¹Btur-fluid is shifted by 0. 8 ± 0. 5 % at 700 °C towards more negative values. This corresponds to an intracrystalline fractionation of 8 ± 5 %, whereby ¹⁰B preferentially occupies the tetrahedral T site relative to the trigonal B site. Possibly, the effect of tetrahedral boron in tourmaline on the B-isotope fractionation is even greater at lower temperatures. Turmalin ist das häufigste Borosilikat der Erdkruste und das Verhältnis seiner zwei B Isotope (¹¹B/¹⁰B), gibt Auskunft über Quelle und Entwicklung von Fluiden während metamorpher, magmatischer und hydrothermaler Prozesse. Turmalin ist beispielsweise ein häufiges akzessorisches Mineral in der metasedimentären Pfitsch Formation im Pfitscher Joch Gebiet im westlichen Tauern-Fenster (Alpen). Turmalin zeigt hier kontinuierlich abnehmende B Isotopenverhältnisse vom Kern zum Rand. In Kombination mit der B Isotopie der Gesamtgesteine und eines Rayleigh Fraktionierungsmodells zeigt sich, dass diese Signatur am ehesten auf die interne Umverteilung von B, ausgehend von einem Vorläufermineral (z. B Glimmer) zu erklären ist. Die Interpretation von B Isotopenmustern in natürlichem Turmalin setzt voraus, dass die B Isotopenfraktionierung zwischen Turmalin und Fluid (∆¹¹Btur-fluid) bekannt ist. Bis heute berücksichtigen experimentelle Studien lediglich Turmalin mit B in trigonaler Koordination ([3]B), wobei aber natürliche Turmaline häufig überschüssiges Bor auf der Tetraederposition ([4]B) einbauen. In dieser Studie, werden ausgehend von Stempel-Zylinder Syntheseexperimenten unter hohem Druck (4. 0 GPa) und einer Temperatur von 700 °C,∆¹¹Btur-fluid Werte in Abhängigkeit des Gehalts an [4]B in Turmalin bestimmt. Olenitischer Turmalin reich an [4]B [(∼ 2. 5 Atome pro Formeleinheit (pfu) ] wurde im System SiO₂-Al₂O₃-B₂O₃-NaCl-H₂O synthetisiert. Zeitabhängige Experimente zeigen, dass dieser sich auf einem nicht-klassischen Kristallisationspfad bildet, der Jeremejevit als Vorläuferphase beinhaltet. Rossmanitischer Turmalin mit geringeren [4]B Gehalten (∼ 0. 6 pfu) wurde im System Li₂O-SiO₂-Al₂O₃-B₂O₃-H₂O synthetisiert. Der Mechanismus für den Einbau von B auf der Tetraederposition folgt TSi- 1 VO- 1 TB 1 V(OH) 1 als Haupt- und X - 1 TSi- 1 XNa 1 TB 1 als Nebenaustauschvektor. Raman-Spektroskopie wurde erfolgreich für die chemische Charakterisierung der synthetischen Turmaline verwendet, einschließlich der Quantifizierung von [4]B und dem erstmaligen Nachweis von Li auf der X Position. Um ∆¹¹Btur-fluid in Abhängigkeit des [4]B Gehalts zu bestimmen, wurden B Isotopenverhältnisse in den synthetischen olenitischen Turmalinen mittels ortsauflösender Sekundärionen-Massenspektroskopie (SIMS) und B Isotopenverhätnisse in koexistierenden Fluiden mittels Multikollektor- Argonplasma-Massenspektroskopie bestimmt. Die genauesten SIMS Daten wurden unter Verwendung eines natürlichen Olenits als Referenzmaterial bestimmt, was die Notwendigkeit matrixangepasster Referenzmaterialien im Zusammenhang mit SIMS B Isotopen-analysen von Turmalinen zeigt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass bei 10 mol% des Gesamtbors in tetraedrischer Koordination, die ∆¹¹Btur-fluid Werte bei 700 °C um 0. 8 ± 0. 5 % kleiner werden. Das entspricht einer intrakristallinen Fraktionierung von 8 ± 5 %, wobei das ¹⁰B Isotop die tetraedrische T Position gegenüber der trigonalen B Position bevorzugt.

Glass shards from approximately half of the ash layers studied were found to have uniform compositions which approach the precision of the microprobe chemical analyses, whereas the remainder are compositionally diverse (e. g., SiO 2, variations of 5 – 15 % among shards from the same ash layer) and appear to be the eruptive products of compositionally zoned magma chambers. Optical studies of glass shards confirm the absence of devitrification or the formation of pervasive secondary alteration products. By contrast, chemical studies suggest that the glass shards have experienced progressive hydration with possible <b>minor</b> ion <b>exchange</b> of K, Mg, Ca and Si. The hydration occurs rapidly and leads to a rather uniform water content of 4. 5 – 5 % after several hundred thousands of years exposure to seawater. Step-wise heating dehydration experiments, optical effects, and published'oxygen isotope studies indicate that the water of hydration is incorporated uniformly within the glass. Systematic chemical differences between electron microprobe analyses of glass shard interiors and corresponding bulk chemical study by atomic absorption lead us to postulate that glass shard margins have undergone a <b>minor</b> chemical <b>exchange</b> with major cations in seawater. They have gained 0. 10 – 0. 20 wt. % K 20, MgO, and CaO while losing a corresponding amount of Si 2 O. Although the glass shards from DSDP Site 192 are hydrated and may have experienced subtle, surficial ion exchange, we stress that they are the most chemically representative samples available of magmas that were explosively erupted from volcanic arcs...|$|R

Two square towers were built {{on the north side}} of the inner bailey in the late 12th century, possibly contemporaneously with Framlingham. The castle was protected using the castle-guard system, under which local lands were granted to <b>minor</b> lords in <b>exchange</b> for the contribution of knights and soldiers for the defence of the castle.|$|R
40|$|Consider {{a compact}} Riemannian {{manifold}} with boundary endowed with a magnetic field. A path taken by a particle of unit charge, mass, and energy is called a magnetic geodesic. It is shown that if everything is real-analytic, the topology, metric, and magnetic field are uniquely determined by the scattering relation of the magnetic geodesic flow, measured at the boundary. Conjugate points are allowed with <b>minor</b> restrictions. In <b>exchange</b> for the real-analytic assumption, prior results in boundary rigidity are greatly generalized...|$|R
