It has been shown that using welled diffusers on the top of T-shaped barriers makes a reactive barrier that shows better performance than that of any other used profile barriers compared with their equivalent absorbent barrier. The contribution of the top surface of reactive T-profile barriers to their efficiency in the shadow zone is discussed in this paper. The new multiple impedance discontinuity (NMID) method was used on a few <b>multi-welled</b> surfaces and the application of the findings on the diffuser T-profile barrier along with a descriptive theory of the welled surface effect was presented. An acceptable agreement between the result of the NMID model and BEM method for a few welled surfaces were found. The area-averaged impedance model was also used in the NMID model and it was found that this model can be a good performance indicator for a <b>multi-welled</b> surface. In order to explain the contribution of the top surface of a T-profile barrier, it is adequate to use the NMID model on a mixed ground equivalent to the top surface of the barrier where the source and receiver are located at near the ground where the separation of source and receiver is identical with the overall span of the cap.

30|$|It is envisioned {{that the}} {{calculated}} dew point from this model {{could be used}} in several applications. First, it can be employed as a form of quality control to ensure the sampling procedure takes fluid samples with down-hole pressure above the dew point pressure (for more accurate sampling). This can serve as a confirmation to the current operational procedure of establishing dew point (by pumping out until liquid appears and is sensed by the tool sensors). This is particularly useful in low condensate gas ratio fluids. Secondly, it provides a quick estimate of dew point pressure that can help in any further estimation of phase behavior of gas wells for reservoir and production engineering applications. Thirdly, in cases having extensive down-hole data for <b>multi-wells</b> in the same reservoir, the calculated dew point pressure can be used to quality control the down-hole data. In this application, the trend of the calculated dew point pressure will be checked to see whether it follows the expected increase with depth trend.

High-throughput experiments (such as imaging <b>multi-well</b> plates) of liquid samples can however provide valuable information. In this case, the parallel acquisition of thousands of spectra can be used to compare differences between samples, rather than the more common implementation of exploring spatial heterogeneity within a single sample.|$|E
50|$|Polystyrene resin is a {{versatile}} resin {{and it is}} quite useful in <b>multi-well,</b> automated peptide synthesis, due to its minimal swelling in dichloromethane. The initial support used by R. Bruce Merrifield was polysytrene cross-linked with 2% divinylbenzene. This support is {{sometimes referred to as}} the 'Merrifield resin.' This resin produces a hydrophobic bead that is solvated by a nonpolar solvent such as dichloromethane or dimethylformamide. Since then, new resins have been developed that have the advantages of chemical inertness, and enhanced swelling or rigidity (a property of mechanical strength). For instance, highly cross-linked (50%) polystyrene has been developed that possesses the features of increased mechanical stability, better filtration of reagents and solvents, and rapid reaction kinetics.|$|E

40|$|The {{problems}} of the intermediate-range atomic structure of glasses and of the mechanism for the glass transition are approached from the low-temperature end {{in terms of a}} scenario for the atomic organization that justifies the use of an extended tunneling model. The latter is crucial for the explanation of the magnetic and compositional effects discovered in non-metallic glasses in the Kelvin and milli-Kelvin temperature range. The model relies on the existence of <b>multi-welled</b> local potentials for the effective tunneling particles that are a manifestation of a non-homogeneous atomic structure deriving from the established dynamical heterogeneities that characterize the supercooled liquid state. It is shown that the extended tunneling model can successfully explain a range of experiments at low temperatures, but the proposed non-homogeneous atomic structure scenario is then tested in the light of available high resolution electron microscopy imaging of the structure of some glasses and on the behaviour near the transition.

40|$|We present here a gas {{deliverability}} {{computational model}} for single reservoir with multi wells. The questions {{of how long}} the gas delivery can be sustained and how to estimate the plateau time are discussed here. In order to answer such a question, in this case, a coupling method which consists of material balance method and gas flow equation method is developed by assuming no water influx in the reservoir. Given the rate and the minimum pressure of gas at the processing plant, the gas pressure at the wellhead and at the bottom hole can be obtained. From here, the estimation of the gas deliverability can be done. In this paper we obtain a computational method which gives direct computation for pressure drop from the processing plant to the wells, taking into account different well behavior. Here AOF technique is used for obtaining gas rate in each well. Further Tian & Adewumi correlation is applied for pressure drop model along vertical and horizontal pipes and Runge-Kutta method is chosen to compute the well head and bottom hole pressures in each well which then being used to estimate the plateau times. We obtain here direct computational scheme of gas deliverability from reservoir to processing plant for single reservoir with <b>multi-wells</b> properties.

30|$|The {{movement}} of groundwater depends considerably on the stratigraphical and structural {{units of the}} region. In hillslope terrains, the flow of groundwater inherits certain unique features that are seldom seen in horizontal strata. Most importantly, aquifers in hillslope regions are underlain by sloping impervious beds. In such cases, approximation of groundwater flow {{based on the assumption}} that the streamlines are nearly parallel to the sloping bed (Dupuit–Forchheimer assumption) yields more accurate results. Childs (1971) formulated the unsteady groundwater flow in skewed coordinate system (along and perpendicular to the sloping base) by a nonlinear Boussinesq equation. Chapman (1980) converted this approximation in rectangular coordinate system. Analytic solutions of linearized Boussinesq equation under varying hydrologic conditions are presented by a number of investigators (Brutsaert 1994; Verhoest and Troach 2000; Upadhyaya and Chauhan 2001; Bansal and Das 2009, 2011; Bansal 2012). Using finite Fourier transform, effects of localized recharge from single basin on the evolution of groundwater mound in downward sloping aquifers of rectangular shape were analyzed by Ram and Chauhan (1987), Singh et al. (1991) and Ramana et al. (1995). By considering varying hydraulic conductivities along x- and y-axes, Chang and Yeh (2007) analyzed two-dimensional transient groundwater flow in a sloping aquifer due to time-varying recharge from single recharge basin and extraction from <b>multi-wells.</b> Closed form analytic expressions for spatio-temporal variations in water head over semi-infinite sloping bed due to localized recharge is presented by Bansal and Das (2010) and Bansal (2013). The aforementioned studies highlight the importance of bed slope in the determination of transient profiles of phreatic surface; however, the results are either exceedingly complicated or suffer from slow convergence.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the possible use of soft contact lenses (CL) {{to improve the}} secretagogue role of diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap 4 A) promoting tear secretion. Methods: Two conventional hydrogel CL (Omafilcon A and Ocufilcon D) and two silicone hydrogel (SiH) CL (Comfilcon A and Balafilcon A) were used. Ap 4 A was loaded into the lenses by soaking in a 1 mM Ap 4 A solution during 12 h.

In vivo experiments were performed in New Zealand rabbits and both the dinucleotide release from SiH and tear secretion were measured by means of Schirmer strips and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Results: Ap 4 A in vitro release experiments in hydrogel CL presented a release time 50 (RT 50) of 3. 9 ± 0. 2 min and 3. 1 ± 0. 1 min for the non-ionic and the ionic CL, respectively.
