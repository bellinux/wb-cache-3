25|$|On August 23, 2008, former Hendrick Motorsports driver Casey Mears {{was signed}} {{to drive the}} 07 in 2009, with Bowyer moving to the fourth RCR car, the No. 33. Mears {{struggled}} in the new ride, however, and had to take on three crew chiefs during the season. <b>More</b> <b>troubling</b> {{was the fact that}} Jack Daniel's announced on September 21, 2009 that they would be leaving RCR {{at the end of the}} year, leaving the 07 without a sponsor. Childress decided to release Mears at the end of the year, and sell the 07's owners points to Furniture Row Racing.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, {{after the}} fall of the Eastern Bloc, the former East Germany became part of the Communities as part of a reunified Germany. A close fiscal {{integration}} with the introduction of the euro was not matched by institutional oversight making things <b>more</b> <b>troubling.</b> Attempts to solve the problems and to make the EU more efficient and coherent had limited success.With further enlargement planned to include the former communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, the Copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the EU were agreed upon in June 1993. The expansion of the EU introduced a new level of complexity and discord.|$|E
25|$|A {{study done}} by Harris (2002) tested these {{hypotheses}} among 210 individuals, 48 homosexual women, 50 homosexual men, 40 heterosexual women, and 49 heterosexual men. Results {{found that more}} heterosexual than homosexual individuals picked sexual infidelity as worse than emotional infidelity, with heterosexual men being the highest, and that when forced to choose, gay men overwhelmingly predicted emotional infidelity would be <b>more</b> <b>troubling</b> than sexual infidelity (Harris, 2002). These findings contradict Symons (1979) suggestion {{that there would be}} no gender difference in predicted responses to infidelity by sexual orientation; however more research in this area should be conducted. Blow and Bartlett (2005) suggest that even though sex outside of a homosexual relationship might be seen as more acceptable in some relationships, the consequences of infidelity do not occur without pain or jealousy.|$|E

25|$|There are {{anomalies}} for all paradigms, Kuhn maintained, {{that are}} brushed away as acceptable levels of error, or simply ignored and not dealt with (a principal argument Kuhn uses to reject Karl Popper's model of falsifiability {{as the key}} force involved in scientific change). Rather, according to Kuhn, anomalies have various levels of significance to the practitioners of science at the time. To {{put it in the}} context of early 20th century physics, some scientists found the problems with calculating Mercury's perihelion <b>more</b> <b>troubling</b> than the Michelson-Morley experiment results, and some the other way around. Kuhn's model of scientific change differs here, and in many places, from that of the logical positivists in that it puts an enhanced emphasis on the individual humans involved as scientists, rather than abstracting science into a purely logical or philosophical venture.|$|E
25|$|Intelligence {{summaries}} initially did {{not believe}} the INA to be a substantial force or have any purpose more than propaganda and espionage purposes. However, by the end of 1942, they had become aware of trained Indian espionage agents (of the INAs Special services group) who had infiltrated into India for the purpose of collecting intelligence, subversion of the army and the subversion of civilian loyalty. These information were derived to a large extent from some of the agents themselves who gave themselves up to the authorities after reaching India. However, the intelligence was also aware at this point of misinformation being spread about the INA itself by the agents who concealed their purpose and professed to pass on intelligence from local knowledge. <b>More</b> <b>troubling</b> for the military command were the activities of the INA agents in the battle fields of India's eastern frontier in Burma.|$|E
25|$|While Ferrari {{celebrated their}} dominance, the sport itself {{was seen by}} many to be in trouble. Two more privateers, Prost and Arrows, had closed their doors for good. Benetton was also no more, the team having been {{completely}} bought out by Renault and turned into their factory team. Even <b>more</b> <b>troubling</b> was the one team in seemingly no danger of disappearing: Ferrari. While Formula One was no stranger to teams monopolizing the winner's stand, Ferrari's actions throughout the 2002 season annoyed many; in particular the staged finishes of the Austrian Grand Prix and the US Grand Prix. It seemed to many {{that it was possible to}} take the dictum of 'win at all costs' too far. Ratings and attendance noticeably declined in the later half of 2002, a serious problem for a sport which was by far the most expensive (and, more importantly, most lucrative) in the world by this time. Also, a number of major manufacturers had joined Formula One since 2000 - there were now 8 manufacturers participating in some form in Formula One. Toyota, Ford/Jaguar and Renault had joined as full works teams, and Mercedes, Honda, BMW and Cosworth were all supplying engines to specific teams.|$|E

500|$|Critics had minor criticisms {{with the}} game's quality when {{comparing}} to its contemporaries.

[...] Ekholm was not pleased {{that he had to}} unfold a flimsy poster to identify the requested city. [...] His copy was falling apart after several identifications. [...] The game further frustrated him when it failed to acknowledge the correct key. [...] The provided hints were incorrect, a situation also experienced by the Lessers.

500|$|<b>More</b> <b>troubling</b> was {{the lack}} of legal {{guidance}} on presidential succession: as Garfield lingered near death, no one was sure who, if anyone, could exercise presidential authority. Also, after Conkling's resignation, the Senate had adjourned without electing a president pro tempore, who would normally follow Arthur in the succession. [...] Arthur was reluctant to be seen acting as president while Garfield lived, and for the next two months there was a void of authority in the executive office, with Garfield too weak to carry out his duties, and Arthur reluctant to assume them. Through the summer, Arthur refused to travel to Washington and was at his Lexington Avenue home when, on the night of September19, he learned that Garfield had died. [...] Judge John R. Brady of the New York Supreme Court administered the oath of office in Arthur's home at 2:15a.m. on September20. Later that day he took a train to Long Branch to pay his respects to Garfield and to leave a card of sympathy for his wife, afterwards returning to New York City. On the 21st, he returned to Long Branch to take part in Garfield's funeral, and then joined the funeral train to Washington. [...] Before leaving New York, he ensured the presidential line of succession by preparing and mailing to the White House a proclamation calling for a Senate special session. This step ensured that the Senate had legal authority to convene immediately and choose a Senate president pro tempore, who would be able to assume the presidency if Arthur died. Once in Washington he destroyed the mailed proclamation and issued a formal call for a special session.|$|E

Conflicts ensued, and in 1744 the Maryland legislature purchased {{the land from}} the area's Native Americans, observing they would settle [...] "for nothing less than Blood or Money." [...] This contract opened the area to official settlement. Germans, Swiss-Germans, and Scotch-Irish from Pennsylvania quickly colonized the area.

60|$|For {{the same}} uprush of fancy which {{had shown him}} with all the force of {{mathematical}} demonstration that life had no meaning, brought with it another idea; {{and that was why}} Cronshaw, he imagined, had given him the Persian rug. As the weaver elaborated his pattern for no end but the pleasure of his aesthetic sense, so might a man live his life, or if one was forced to believe that his actions were outside his choosing, so might a man look at his life, that it made a pattern. There was as little need to do this as there was use. It was merely something he did for his own pleasure. Out of the manifold events of his life, his deeds, his feelings, his thoughts, he might make a design, regular, elaborate, complicated, or beautiful; and though it might be no more than an illusion that he had the power of selection, though it might be no more than a fantastic legerdemain in which appearances were interwoven with moonbeams, that did not matter: it seemed, and so to him it was. In the vast warp of life (a river arising from no spring and flowing endlessly to no sea), with the background to his fancies that there was no meaning and that nothing was important, a man might get a personal satisfaction in selecting the various strands that worked out the pattern. There was one pattern, the most obvious, perfect, and beautiful, in which a man was born, grew to manhood, married, produced children, toiled for his bread, and died; but there were others, intricate and wonderful, in which happiness did not enter and in which success was not attempted; and in them might be discovered a <b>more</b> <b>troubling</b> grace. Some lives, and Hayward's was among them, the blind indifference of chance cut off while the design was still imperfect; and then the solace was comfortable that it did not matter; other lives, such as Cronshaw's, offered a pattern which was difficult to follow, the point of view had to be shifted and old standards had to be altered before one could understand that such a life was its own justification. Philip thought that in throwing over the desire for happiness he was casting aside the last of his illusions. His life had seemed horrible when it was measured by its happiness, but now he seemed to gather strength as he realised that it might be measured by something else. Happiness mattered as little as pain. They came in, both of them, as all the other details of his life came in, to the elaboration of the design. He seemed for an instant to stand above the accidents of his existence, and he felt that they could not affect him again as they had done before. Whatever happened to him now would be one more motive to add to the complexity of the pattern, and when the end approached he would rejoice in its completion. It would be a work of art, and it would be none the less beautiful because he alone knew of its existence, and with his death it would at once cease to be.|$|E
