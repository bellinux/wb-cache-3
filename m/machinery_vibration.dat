30|$|More generally, for an {{irregular}}-paced signal model such as Eq.  37 a, {{time warping}} as in Eq.  37 b affects the pacemaker’s rate and, as desired, can convert the irregular pulse-times of occurrence to regular pulse-angles (in {{the case of}} rotating machinery) of occurrence {θ_n}={ 2 π n+θ_∗}; but, Eq.  37 b also reveals that this time warping also affects the time scale of the individual paced pulses or bursts {q_n(t)}={q_n(ψ^- 1 (θ))}{q̃_n(θ)} and the warped pulses {q̃_n(θ)} are no longer identically distributed. Consequently, neither the irregular-paced signal nor the time-warped regular-paced signal are cyclostationary.

50|$|Condition {{monitoring}} (or, colloquially, CM) is {{the process}} of monitoring a parameter of condition in <b>machinery</b> (<b>vibration,</b> temperature etc.), in order to identify a significant change which is indicative of a developing fault. It is a major component of predictive maintenance. The use of condition monitoring allows maintenance to be scheduled, or other actions to be taken to prevent failure and avoid its consequences. Condition monitoring has a unique benefit in that conditions that would shorten normal lifespan can be addressed before they develop into a major failure. Condition monitoring techniques are normally used on rotating equipment and other machinery (pumps, electric motors, internal combustion engines, presses), while periodic inspection using non-destructive testing techniques and fit for service (FFS) evaluation are used for stationary plant equipment such as steam boilers, piping and heat exchangers.|$|E

Extensive experiments were conducted on Forward Curved Centrifugal Blower Test Rig at selected cutoff speeds for several combinations of combined horizontal and vertical parallel misalignment, combined parallel and angular misalignment, as well as for various unbalance conditions.

For the purpose of mitigating unwanted structural and/or <b>machinery</b> <b>vibrations,</b> the traditional MRE-based isolators have been generally proven effective because the MR effect can increase the stiffness when the magnetic field is strengthened. This study presents a novel MRE isolator that experienced reduced stiffness when the applied current was increased. This innovative work was accomplished by applying a hybrid magnet (electromagnet and permanent magnets) onto a multilayered MRE structure. To characterise this negative changing stiffness concept, a multilayered MRE isolator with a hybrid magnet was first designed, fabricated and then tested to measure its properties. An obvious reduction of the effective stiffness and natural frequency of the proposed MRE isolator occurred when the current was continuously adjusted. This device could also work as a conventional MRE isolator as its effective stiffness and natural frequency also increased when a negative current was applied. Further testing was carried out on a one-degree-of-freedom system to assess how effectively this device could isolate vibration. In this experiment, two cases were considered; in each case, the vibration of the primary system was obviously attenuated under ON-OFF control logic, thus demonstrating the feasibility of this novel design as an alternative adaptive vibration isolator...|$|R

Since piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) nanogenerators (NGs) were demonstrated for electric power conversion from mechanical energy in 2006 [4], they have been considered as a key technique for realizing the environment-friendly energy harvesting technology. As an external mechanical {{force is applied to}} vertically aligned ZnO nanowires or nanorods using an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip, the positive/negative potential is induced at the stretched/compressed side of ZnO, thus leading to a piezoelectric charge generation [5]. By utilizing this principle of piezoelectric ZnO NGs, over the last decades, there have been considerable efforts to improve the performance and efficiency of piezoelectric ZnO NGs in regard to various types/properties of ZnO nanostructures and surface contact of electrodes. The first one has been achieved by growing ZnO nanowires, nanorods, and nanobelts on the flexible polyethersulfone or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate via a chemical solution method [6, 7]. The other one was an alternative way in which zig-zag-shaped or network electrodes (consisting of patterned noble metals, carbon nanotubes, or graphene) were employed as a top electrode to efficiently bend the ZnO nanostructures for transmitting the external mechanical energy as well as possible [8, 9]. However, these kinds of top electrodes needed a somewhat sophisticated fabrication process for the preparation of patterned electrodes or synthesis of carbon-based nanomaterials.|$|R
