For a while, they offered a very personal service with Brian Souter doing the driving and Ann Gloag making up sandwiches and snacks for the passengers.|$|E

50|$|Motorhomes or campervans have to {{undertake}} an inspection and the vehicle has to meet certain criteria {{in order to}} become certified. Being self-contained requires having the equipment on board to remove any waste generated in a freedom camping designated area.

50|$|In 2008, Lifesure {{merged with}} another company called MCIA (<b>Motor</b> <b>Caravan</b> Insurance Agency) Limited.

Their focus had been on motor caravans in the UK, but also included insurance products such as park home insurance and travel insurance.|$|E
50|$|The Sherwood was {{an estate}} car {{conversion}} based around the Ford Cortina but {{using a new}} chassis. The rear roof section was detachable to make the car into a pick-up. More unusual was the Starcraft, a six-wheel <b>motor</b> <b>caravan</b> conversion for the Ford Cortina Mk III to V. A new steel chassis took the Cortina's mechanical components and on this was mounted a large body shell which included an overhanging section above the driver and passenger seats. The bonnet area was restyled but the centre section of the Cortina was retained including wiring, instruments and windscreen.|$|E
50|$|The {{speed limit}} is 70 mph (112km/h) on motorways, 70 mph (112km/h) on dual carriageways, 60 mph (96km/h) on single carriageways and 30 mph (48km/h) {{in areas with}} street {{lighting}} (restricted roads). These limits may be reduced by roadside signs and apply to cars, motorcycles, car-derived vans up to 2 tonnes maximum laden weight (MLW), and to motorhomes or <b>motor</b> <b>caravans</b> not more than 3.05 tonnes maximum unladen weight. Other classes of vehicles are subject to lower limits on some roads.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the true}} {{measure of the}} success of the {{movement}} that Alan Rogers started is to note how many of the things he called for in his original guide have now become reality. Mains electricity connections in <b>caravans</b> and <b>motor</b> <b>caravans,</b> marked pitches of a minimum size, hot water freely available in the amenity blocks, British style toilets on French campsites, the use of trees and bushes to mark pitches and an end to the practice of over-crowding of sites during the peak summer holiday times.|$|R
50|$|The laws {{state that}} {{visitors}} with caravans must {{be members of}} The Caravan Club, who are required to act responsibly and to observe the Country Code {{and no more than}} 5 caravans may be accommodated on the site at any one time. Caravans may not stay for more than 28 days per visit and must be occupied overnight. CLs are for recreational purposes and only touring <b>caravans,</b> <b>motor</b> <b>caravans</b> or trailer tents are permitted - tents are not permitted, other than attached caravan awnings, toilet tents or small pup tents; and permanently sited (static) caravans are not permitted on the same landholding.|$|R
50|$|On 13 November 2011, , a {{possible}} fourth {{member of the}} NSU, was arrested and brought the following day before a judge at Germany's Federal Court of Justice, who ordered him to be detained in custody. The German Attorney General's Office wanted Gerlach detained on suspicion of membership in a terrorist group. However the court's investigating judge only authorized Gerlach to be detained on suspicion of supporting a terrorist organization. The Attorney General of Germany also supposed that he had rented a <b>motor</b> <b>caravan</b> for the NSU, which they used {{for the murder of}} the policewoman and severe maiming of her colleague, in Heilbronn.|$|E
50|$|The Thames van {{was also}} {{instrumental}} {{in helping the}} motorised caravan or campervan to establish itself in a period when people were extending their horizons with regard to holidays and camping. The Ford Thames 15 cwt van formed an ideal base for a <b>motor</b> <b>caravan</b> because it could double as an ordinary vehicle during the week and be used for picnics or breaks away from home at weekends. Its roughly square shape lent itself well to conversion to a caravan, as many people had noticed {{when they saw the}} estate car and 12 seater bus versions.|$|E

However it was fitted up with a telephone installation, lavatory, linen lockers, etc and on show with a dinner table laid for six. A kitchen was in a separate compartment at the back.

50|$|In New Zealand <b>motor</b> camp, <b>caravan</b> park or holiday {{parks are}} the usual terms for {{overnight}} or long term vehicle based camping. As well powered caravan or campervan sites the parks usually offer tent sites and cabins, a rudimentary building with cooking {{and other facilities}} shared with other users.|$|R
5000|$|During {{its life}} the van {{underwent}} minor improvements under the metal. However, even in 1967 the vans were still shipped with synchromesh {{on the top}} three forward gears only. The engine lived in the driver's cabin between the two seats: the van was considered unusually noisy, even in the 1960s. A J4-based petrol-engined <b>motor</b> <b>caravan</b> was tested by Britain's Autocar magazine in 1967. It managed a maximum speed of 63 mph (101 km/h) and a time from 0-50 mph (80 km/h) of 20.2 seconds. [...] The vehicle as tested weighed 2910 lb and overall petrol consumption for the test came in at 22.7 mpgimp.|$|E

50|$|On 'closed' back models this {{flexibility}} for conversion was {{not considered}} necessary as customers buying an enclosed van type vehicle were unlikely to require access to the chassis {{in a similar fashion}} as 'open' back purchasers. More likely modification of the bodywork undertaken by 'closed' back purchasers would constitute removal of roof panels for elevating sections or the addition of windows {{as can be seen in}} many <b>motor</b> <b>caravan</b> conversions for example. As a result, it was decided that steel bodywork and cab sections could be welded directly to the chassis in places mainly for ease of construction and consequently adding additional stability to the chassis in a similar fashion to that of a coachbuilder converting an 'open' model. It should be stressed that this welded bodywork was not essential for maintaining acceptable levels of torsional chassis strength, the chassis design of the 'closed' back models should not be considered as 'unitary' for this reason. The correct definition in this case is a 'body reinforced separate chassis'.|$|E

50|$|The Mayor of London {{announced}} {{establishment of}} a low-emission zone which came into effect on 4 February 2008 covering almost all of Greater London - the largest such zone in the world. London currently has levels of air pollution among the worst in Europe and road transport related emissions account for around half of total emissions of PM10 and NOx in the capital. The Low Emission Zone will target emissions of these pollutants from older diesel-engined lorries, buses, coaches, vans, minibuses and other heavy vehicles that are derived from lorries and vans such as <b>motor</b> <b>caravans</b> and motorised horse boxes. There will be a phased introduction of the scheme from 4 February 2008 through to January 2012. Different vehicles will be affected over time and increasingly tougher emissions standards will apply.|$|R
