The Battle of Nashville {{was one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>stunning</b> victories achieved by the Union Army in the war. The formidable Army of Tennessee, the second largest Confederate force, was effectively destroyed as a fighting force. Hood's army entered Tennessee with over 30,000 men but left with 1520,000.|$|E
25|$|Burgundy wine has {{experienced}} much {{change over the}} past 75 years. Economic depression during the 1930s {{was followed by the}} devastation caused by World War II. After the War, the vignerons returned home to their unkempt vineyards. The soils and vines had suffered and were sorely in need of nurturing. The growers began to fertilize, bringing their vineyards back to health. Those who could afford it added potassium, a mineral fertilizer that contributes to vigorous growth. By the mid-1950s, the soils were balanced, yields were reasonably low and the vineyards produced some of the <b>most</b> <b>stunning</b> wines in the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|One of the <b>most</b> <b>stunning</b> finds {{of royal}} statues dating to his reign was made as {{recently}} as 1989 {{in the courtyard of}} Amenhotep III's colonnade of the Temple of Luxor where a cache of statues was found, including a -high pink quartzite statue of the king wearing the Double Crown found in near-perfect condition. It was mounted on a sled, and may have been a cult statue. The only damage it had sustained was that the name of the god Amun had been hacked out wherever it appeared in the pharaoh's cartouche, clearly done as part of the systematic effort to eliminate any mention of this god during the reign of his successor, Akhenaten.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his penchant}} for making big moves, Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren pulled off perhaps the <b>most</b> <b>stunning</b> move of his tenure, trading Mike Richards to the Los Angeles Kings for Brayden Schenn, Wayne Simmonds and a 2012 second-round draft pick; and Jeff Carter to Columbus for their 2011 first-round pick (with which the Flyers {{selected}} Sean Couturier), 2011 third-round pick (with which the Flyers selected Nick Cousins) and Jakub Voracek, all within the span of one hour on June 23. Later that same day, Holmgren addressed the Flyers' long-standing goaltending issues by signing the Phoenix Coyotes' Ilya Bryzgalov to a nine-year, $51million contract. On July 1, the Flyers signed Jaromir Jagr to a one-year contract, Maxime Talbot to a five-year contract and Andreas Lilja to a two-year contract. Additionally, Chris Pronger was named Flyers captain; however, 13 games into the 2011–12 season, he was lost {{for the remainder of}} the regular season and playoffs with severe post-concussion syndrome. Bryzgalov's play ranged from spectacular to sub-par, including being benched in favor of Sergei Bobrovsky for the Flyers' 3–2 loss to the New York Rangers in the 2012 Winter Classic, but also being named NHL First Star for the month of March. Twelve rookies suited up for the Flyers during the season, with the play of Couturier, Schenn and Matt Read standing out impressively.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to the polls, the UMP lost ground, but it {{maintained}} a workable majority. The Socialists unexpectedly gained seats. Their plea to voters {{to prevent an}} overwhelming UMP dominance of the legislature appears to have paid off, providing the Socialists {{with a measure of}} redemption from the election loss. UDF splinter groups, François Bayrou's MoDem and the New Centre, contested their first elections. MoDem won 4 seats (including Mayotte regionalist Abdoulatifou Aly), while the New Centre was able to form a parliamentary group, with 22 seats. It {{remains to be seen whether}} Bayrou's party, which polled the third highest vote (7.61% in round one), will develop into a major political force. Their result is an improvement on the UDF's result of 4.9% in 2002. The National Front (FN) polled its lowest vote since its splash onto the political scene in 1986. The FN lost more than 60% of its support base since 2002. Support for the Communist Party also declined, and they saw a loss of several seats, whilst several other left-wing parties won nine new seats. The Greens gained one new seat, despite a fall in their vote. One of the <b>most</b> <b>stunning</b> results was the surprise defeat of UMP party leader Alain Juppé by the Socialist Party candidate Michèle Delaunay. Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres was defeated as well losing to Socialist Party candidate Jean-Patrick Gille. The far right did not win any seats.|$|E

As no game had ever received such a high rating before, and as the commercial Commodore 64 scene was winding down in the mid-1990s, the awarding of 100% was seen as somewhat controversial. The game, titled Mayhem in Monsterland, was developed to exploit a multitude of programming tricks and quirks in the Commodore 64's hardware to the maximum. The impressive use of non-standard colors and scrolling resulted in perhaps the <b>most</b> graphically <b>stunning</b> game ever produced for the Commodore 64. The gameplay itself {{is similar to that}} of Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. and SEGA's Sonic the Hedgehog.|$|R
500|$|The tournament was uneventful for Collingwood and the English, {{as he and}} {{the team}} were soon left by the wayside after {{qualification}} into the Super Eight round. Unimpressive victories over Ireland [...] followed by a nervy 37-run seventh wicket stand with Paul Nixon to victory over Bangladesh along with a close 2-run loss to Sri Lanka [...] and heavy losses to Australia and South Africa meant elimination from the knockout stages, as Collingwood was only able to manage lower scores with limited successes with the white ball. He did, however, end up as the tournament's joint top fielder, grabbing eight catches along with Graeme Smith, and took what is arguably his <b>most</b> <b>stunning</b> catch, to dismiss Devon Smith off the bowling of Andrew Flintoff during the final Super Eight match versus the West Indies.|$|E
500|$|Buffy essayist Ian Shuttleworth {{writes that}} Amber Benson (Tara) has [...] "the sweetest singing voice {{of all the}} lead players", {{referring}} to [...] "Under Your Spell" [...] as [...] "heavenly and salacious"; author Nikki Stafford concurs, writing that Benson [...] "has the <b>most</b> <b>stunning</b> voice, showing a surprising range". Whedon acknowledged that the [...] "lyrical, heavenly quality" [...] of Benson's voice led him to assign her the episode's love song. Alyson Hannigan (Willow) was unwilling to sing much and her performance is [...] "apprehensive", according to Shuttleworth. He considers this an example of Tara's quieter strength coming {{out in front of}} Willow's showy demonstrations of powerful magic. Buffy studies scholar Rhonda Wilcox interprets Willow's diminished role representing the show's silence about Willow's descent into addiction and darkness {{through the rest of the}} season. Benson remarked that Tara's story arc is significant within the episode, starting out with ecstasy but soon recognizing the illusory circumstances surrounding her bliss and that [...] "life can't be perfect all the time".|$|E

A 1916 column in the American Journal of Numismatics contained the conclusion that [...] "the criticism often heard that 'there is nothing American about the coin except the inscription' is fully warranted." [...] Swiatek and Breen dismissed criticisms as [...] "numerous and mostly irrelevant, based on total misreading of the iconography. [...] with stupid claims that Pallas Athena meant nothing on a U.S. coin unless she could be identified with Liberty, and that Athena's owl would never mean anything to all of us". Vermeule deemed the $50 coins [...] "a tour de force, dated to be sure, but unusual enough in all respects to be worthy of what American numismatic art could achieve". Later Chief Engraver Elizabeth Jones felt that the $50 pieces were [...] "stylistically in step with the period [...] considerable artistic merits". Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth, in their book on U.S. gold coins, deemed the Panama–Pacific $50 pieces [...] "one of the <b>most</b> <b>stunning</b> issues ever produced by the U.S. government".|$|E
