5000|$|<b>Mail</b> <b>Storage</b> {{requires}} more stringent and diligent packing than standard moving, since the packages will {{be handled by}} shippers or a <b>mail</b> <b>storage</b> company's pickup/delivery service. For example, the thin walls of standard moving boxes cannot withstand the multiple transfers, stacking and other rigors of the shipping / mailing process. Further, failing to pack the boxes fully may result in boxes that [...] "cave in" [...] when other boxes are stacked on them. <b>Mail</b> <b>Storage</b> companies often request customers to use thick walled or reinforced shipping boxes, to reinforce the seams with heavy duty packing tape, and to pack boxes to their fullest (while not over-stuffing them). This advice applies to boxes provided by <b>Mail</b> <b>Storage</b> firms as well as boxes provided by the customer. Many <b>mail</b> <b>storage</b> companies charge re-boxing and handling fees for boxes that are poorly packed or damaged on arrival. In addition, insurance charges that were paid by customers may not apply for boxes that were damaged in transit.|$|R

40|$|The German {{government}} has determined a phase out of nuclear power. With {{respect to the}} management of spent fuel {{it was decided to}} terminate transports to reprocessing plants by 2005 and to set up interim <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> on power plant sites. This paper gives an overview of the German concept for spent fuel management focused on the new on-site interim storage concept and the applied interim <b>storage</b> <b>facilities.</b> Since {{the end of the year}} 1998, the utilities have applied for permission of on-site interim storage in 13 <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> and 5 <b>storage</b> areas; one application for the interim <b>storage</b> <b>facility</b> Stade was withdrawn due to the planned final shut down of Stade nuclear power plant in autumn 2003. In 2001 and 2002, 3 on-site storage areas and 2 on-site <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> for spent fuel were licensed by the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS). A main task in 2002 and 2003 has been the examination of the safety and security of the planned interim <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> and the verification of the licensing prerequisites. In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, BfS has also examined the attack with a big passenger airplane. Up to now, these aircraft crash analyses have been performed for three on-site interim storage facilities; the fundamental results will be presented. It is the objective of BfS to conclude the licensing procedures for the applied on-site interim <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> in 2003. With an assumed construction period for the storage buildings of about two years, the on-site interim <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> could then be available in the year 2005...|$|R
