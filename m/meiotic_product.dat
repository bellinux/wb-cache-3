5000|$|Typical of ciliates, T. thermophila differentiates its genome {{into two}} {{functionally}} distinct types of nuclei, each specifically {{used during the}} two different stages of the life cycle. [...] The diploid germline micronucleus is transcriptionally silent and only plays a role during sexual life stages. The germline nucleus contains 5 pairs of chromosomes which encode the heritable information passed down from one sexual generation to the next. During sexual conjugation, haploid micronuclear meiotic products from both parental cells fuse, leading {{to the creation of}} a new micro- and macronucleus in progeny cells. Sexual conjugation occurs when cells starved for at least 2hrs in a nutrient-depleted media encounter a cell of complementary mating type. After a brief period of co-stimulation (~1hr), starved cells begin to pair at their anterior ends to form a specialized region of membrane called the conjugation junction. [...] It is at this junctional zone that several hundred fusion pores form, allowing for the mutual exchange of protein, RNA and eventually a <b>meiotic</b> <b>product</b> of their micronucleus. This whole process takes about 12 hours at 30 °C, but even longer than this at cooler temperatures. The sequence of events during conjugation is outlined in the accompanying figure.|$|E
5000|$|As {{an example}} of the gene {{conversion}} phenomenon, consider genetic crosses of two N. crassa mutant strains defective in gene pan-2. This gene is necessary for the synthesis of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), and mutants defective in this gene can be experimentally identified by their requirement for pantothenic acid in their growth medium. The two pan-2 mutations B5 and B3 are located at different sites in the pan-2 gene, so that a cross of B5 ´ B3 yields wild-type recombinants at low frequency. [...] An analysis of 939 asci in which the genotypes of all meiotic products (ascospores) could be determined found 11 asci with an exceptional segregation pattern. These included six asci in which there was one wild-type <b>meiotic</b> <b>product</b> but no expected reciprocal double-mutant (B5B3) product. Furthermore, in three asci the ratio of meiotic products was 1B5:3B3, rather than in the expected 2:2 ratio. This study, as well as numerous additional studies in N. crassa and other fungi (reviewed by Whitehouse), led to an extensive characterization of gene conversion. It became clear from this work that gene conversion events arise when a molecular recombination event happens to occur near the genetic markers under study (e.g. pan-2 mutations in the above example). Thus studies of gene conversion allowed insight into the details of the molecular mechanism of recombination. Over the decades since the original observations of Mary Mitchell in 1955, a sequence of molecular models of recombination have been proposed based on both emerging genetic data from gene conversion studies and studies of the reaction capabilities of DNA. Current understanding of the molecular mechanism of recombination is discussed in the Wikipedia articles Gene conversion and Genetic recombination. An understanding of recombination is relevant to several fundamental biologic problems, such the role of recombination and recombinational repair in cancer (see BRCA1) and the adaptive function of meiosis (see Meiosis).|$|E

Comparing Ler and Col sequences uncovered 349, 171 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), 58, 085 small and 2315 large insertions/deletions (indels), with highly correlated genome-wide distributions of SNPs, and small indels.

Using mass spectrometry, we identify Gsc 2 p as a Smk 1 p-associated protein. Gsc 2 p is a 1, 3 -β-glucan synthase subunit involved in synthesizing an inner spore wall layer.

Although deposition of the two inner spore wall layers is normal in smk 1 mutants, deposition of the outer layers is aberrant. However, eliminating GSC 2 activity restores normal deposition of the third spore wall layer in smk 1 mutants, indicating that negative regulation of GSC 2 by SMK 1 is important for spore wall deposition.

40|$|SummaryAutomixis, {{the process}} whereby {{the fusion of}} <b>meiotic</b> <b>products</b> restores the diploid state of the egg, is a common mode of {{reproduction}} in plants but has also been described in invertebrate animals [1, 2]. In vertebrates, however, automixis has so far only been discussed as one of several explanations for isolated cases of facultative parthenogenesis [3, 4]. Analyzing oocyte formation in F 1 hybrids derived from Poecilia mexicana limantouri and P. latipinna crosses (the cross {{that led to the}} formation of the gynogenetic Poecilia formosa[5, 6]), we found molecular evidence for automictic oocyte production [7]. The mechanism involves the random fusion of <b>meiotic</b> <b>products</b> after the second meiotic division. The fertilization of diploid oocytes gives rise to fully viable triploid offspring. Although the automictic production of diploid oocytes as seen in these F 1 hybrids clearly represents a preadaptation to parthenogenetic reproduction [8], it is also a powerful intrinsic postzygotic isolation mechanism because the resulting next generation triploids were always sterile. The mechanism described here can explain facultative parthenogenesis [9], as well as varying ploidy levels reported in different animal groups [10].

During meiosis the micronucleus was reduced to 4 haploid nuclei, each with a iC amount of DNA; each <b>meiotic</b> <b>product</b> then replicated to 2 C, but only the nucleus next to the attachment membrane in each conjugant divided to form the two iC gametic nuclei.

40|$|In plants, each male <b>meiotic</b> <b>product</b> {{undergoes}} mitosis, {{and then}} one of the resulting cells divides again, yielding a three-celled pollen grain comprised of a vegetative cell and two sperm cells. Several genes have been found to act in this process, and DUO 1 (DUO POLLEN 1), a transcription factor, {{plays a key role in}} sperm cell formation by activating expression of several germline genes. But how DUO 1 itself is activated and how sperm cell formation is initiated remain unknown. To expand our understanding of sperm cell formation, we characterized an ARID (AT-Rich Interacting Domain) -containing protein, ARID 1, that is specifically required for sperm cell formation in Arabidopsis. ARID 1 localizes within nuclear bodies that are transiently present in the generative cell from which sperm cells arise, coincident with the timing of DUO 1 activation. An arid 1 mutant and antisense arid 1 plants had an increased incidence of pollen with only a single sperm-like cell and exhibited reduced fertility as well as reduced expression of DUO 1. In vitro and in vivo evidence showed that ARID 1 binds to the DUO 1 promoter. Lastly, we found that ARID 1 physically associates with histone deacetylase 8 and that histone acetylation, which in wild type is evident only in sperm, expanded to the vegetative cell nucleus in the arid 1 mutant.

40|$|Mitogen {{activated}} protein kinases (MAPKs) are signaling {{enzymes that}} control diverse processes in eukaryotic cells including proliferation, differentiation, and development. Many MAPKs are activated through well-studied canonical signaling pathways {{in which a}} MAPK kinase phosphorylates a T-X-Y motif in the activation loop of the MAPK. However, MAPKs can also be activated by non-canonical mechanisms. Smk 1 is a meiosis-specific MAPK in the yeast S. cerevisiae that controls spore wall morphogenesis. The Smk 1 pathway provides a model system to interrogate mechanisms of non-canonical MAPK signaling {{in the context of}} a developmental program. ^ Previous genetic studies identified CAK 1, AMA 1, IME 2 and SSP 2 as genes that regulate Smk 1. Cak 1 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) -activating kinase. Ama 1 is a meiosis-specific targeting factor of the APC/C E 3 ubiquitin ligase that controls exit from meiosis II (MII). Ime 2 is a meiosis-specific CDK-like kinase. Ssp 2 is a meiosis-specific protein required for spore morphogenesis, whose biochemical function has not previously been described. ^ In this thesis we provide evidence for a novel spatiotemporal regulatory mechanism in which Cak 1 phosphorylates Smk 1 on its activation-loop T (T 207) as the meiotic divisions are taking place. Smk 1 autophosphorylates its activation-loop Y (Y 209) as Ssp 2 binds Smk 1 at membranes that surround haploid products (prospore membranes; PSMs) during exit from meiosis II. Ssp 2 /Smk 1 complex formation is regulated through multiple mechanisms, preventing premature MAPK activity. First, although both SMK 1 and SSP 2 are transcriptionally induced as cells enter meiosis I (MI), SMK 1 mRNA is translated almost immediately, while SSP 2 mRNA is translationally repressed until Ime 2 triggers its derepression at MII. Next, Ssp 2 localizes to PSMs, but inhibitory phosphates prevent it from binding Smk 1. These phosphates are removed during meiotic exit, as PSMs close around each <b>meiotic</b> <b>product</b> in a step that requires Ama 1. Finally, dephosphorylated Ssp 2 binds Smk 1, inducing autophosphorylation, thus coupling meiotic exit to Smk 1 activation. We also show that RRM-like domains in the C-terminus of Ssp 2 bind Smk 1. Taken together, this work has defined novel mechanisms for spatiotemporally regulating the Smk 1 MAPK during meiotic development. ...|$|E

5000|$|In meiosis, DNA {{replication}} {{is followed}} by two rounds of cell division to produce four potential daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the original parent cell. The two meiotic divisions are known as Meiosis I and Meiosis II. Before meiosis begins, during S phase of the cell cycle, the DNA of each chromosome is replicated so that it consists of two identical sister chromatids, which remain held together through sister chromatid cohesion. This S-phase {{can be referred to}} as [...] "premeiotic S-phase" [...] or [...] "meiotic S-phase". Immediately following DNA replication, meiotic cells enter a prolonged G2-like stage known as meiotic prophase. During this time, homologous chromosomes pair with each other and undergo genetic recombination, a programmed process in which DNA is cut and then repaired, which allows them to exchange some of their genetic information. A subset of recombination events results in crossovers, which create physical links known as chiasmata (singular: chiasma, for the Greek letter Chi (X)) between the homologous chromosomes. In most organisms, these links are essential to direct each pair of homologous chromosomes to segregate away from each other during Meiosis I, resulting in two haploid cells that have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. During Meiosis II, the cohesion between sister chromatids is released and they segregate from one another, as during mitosis. In some cases all four of the <b>meiotic</b> <b>products</b> form gametes such as sperm, spores, or pollen.
