They asked that I release a statement expressing my admiration for Mr. Henley, along with my assistance pulling it off the web as much as possible. Shit's weird. Ain't this guy rich as fuck?

Evidently he liked the result, because right after that, Gary turned back a job he'd been holding onto - dialoguing a little story plotted by Al Hewetson - and Roy asked me to script it from scratch. That was seven-page [...] "Terror of the Pterodactyl" [...] by Syd Shores, and <b>my</b> first <b>credited</b> job.... Over the next six months, even as <b>my</b> <b>credited</b> stories began to appear, I continued to do uncredited collaborations - sometimes by design and sometimes at the last minute." ...|$|R

The report was immediately sent to the VMK staff for review, and any necessary actions were taken against that player's account. Players could also send [...] "emergency" [...] messages to staff without clicking the report button on another player. The main reason for this was if {{something was wrong with}} the game. (e.g.: [...] "I logged in the morning, and all <b>my</b> <b>credits</b> were gone.") Action would be taken against a player's account for sending false or unnecessary reports.
