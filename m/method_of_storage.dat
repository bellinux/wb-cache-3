40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Moisture {{loss from}} fresh fruits results in lost revenue to producers, storage/packing companies, distributors, and {{increased}} {{prices for the}} consumer. Improved <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> and handling are necessary to help prevent moisture loss and retard spoilage. A literature review was conducted to improve knowledge on past and current studies involving cooling and mass transfer rates in fresh fruits. Documentation of field harvesting and tours of storage/packing companies were conducted and <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> and handling described. Simulation of handling processes was performed and the results discussed. Experiments to determine cooling characteristics and mass transfer rates under various storage conditions were performed on several local varieties of fruit. Cooling rates are presented for several different geometries both as individual and bulk fruit. Mass transfer rates were analyzed and overall transpiration coefficients determined on a mass and area basis. Results are compared with other researchers and discussed. Conclusions were drawn and recommendations for future research presented...|$|R

50|$|Enjoying coffee {{made from}} freshly roasted beans {{is one of}} the major driving factors in the {{popularity}} of home roasting. Home roasting has the advantage of being able to roast smaller volumes of coffee to match consumption so that the roasted coffee is used before it goes stale. Depending on the bean's origin and the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> after roasting, generally whole bean coffee flavor is at its peak between seven and fourteen days after roasting, but some beans are best left even longer, up to 21 days. The flavor of ground coffee deteriorates even faster. Methods of extending freshness include refrigeration, freezing, vacuum packaging, and displacing oxygen in the container with an inert gas. Green coffee beans can be kept fresh for 1-3 years, depending upon storage conditions, and more particular home roasters reduce storage time to 8 or even 1.5 months.|$|E

50|$|Organic wastes can be {{destroyed}} by incineration at high temperatures; however, if the waste contains heavy metals or radioactive isotopes, these must be separated and stored, as they cannot {{be destroyed}}. The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> {{will seek to}} immobilize the toxic components of the waste, possibly through storage in sealed containers, inclusion in a stable medium such as glass or a cement mixture, or burial under an impermeable clay cap. Waste transporters and waste facilities may charge fees; consequently, improper methods of disposal {{may be used to}} avoid paying these fees. Where the handling of toxic waste is regulated, the improper disposal of toxic waste may be punishable by fines or prison terms. Burial sites for toxic waste and other contaminated brownfield land may eventually be used as greenspace or redeveloped for commercial or industrial use.|$|E
5000|$|Although Tephrosia vogelii is not {{consumed}} directly, {{it can be}} used {{to increase}} the yield of various crops. For example, leaf extracts of Tephrosia vogelii are used as chemical pesticides. Crops that have had this extract applied show significant decreases in insect and other pest activity. Therefore, crops can grow in areas that they could not before, if they are grown alongside Tephrosia vogelii. In fact, studies have shown a 46.2-52.2% decrease in grain damage. Grain damage was measured by the amount of kernels that were destroyed and also by the net weight loss of the crop. This number varies based on <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage,</b> type of insect measured, and type of stored grain. In one particular study, the extract killed 40% of the attacking insects after a 21-day period. This decrease is about what would be expected from most chemical pesticides.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} safety issues, another issue for {{considering}} using prelit trees is storage considerations.

There are different options that Christmas tree companies offer for pre-lit Christmas tree storage. Many of these allow for the user to store the tree in a box while others offer bags for storage. It is also important to consider the height of the tree for storage. Using the box that the Christmas tree came in {{is by far the most}} common option that is used for handling a Christmas tree. This is because the box will be perfectly built to where it will be easier to move the tree around and to keep it properly secured. In many cases oversized boxes will be used for storage primarily so that the tree will be able to be stored properly during shipping.|$|E

50|$|<b>Methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage,</b> if done incorrectly, {{can also}} damage papyri. The {{traditional}} method in papyrus storage was {{to place the}} papyri between two sheets of glass and then seal the edges with cloth tape. This threatens the papyrus inside since it allows the object to come into {{direct contact with the}} glass, which could cause heat and moisture to come into contact with the papyrus. This could make the papyrus stick to the glass. This could also damage the ink and the surface of the papyrus when the glass is removed. A grayish material, which has been identified as a composite of sodium chloride and traces of vegetable carbohydrates, was seen around the edges of some papyri. Other storage methods which use cellulose nitrate, paper backing, drumming techniques, hinges, adhesive mounts, dry mount systems and plexiglass which presses directly on the papyrus are not considered safe <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage.</b> The threats from these include introducing materials which could stain the artifact, degrading the object or placing pressure on the object. These effects are also not easily reversed.|$|R
5000|$|Once bought, the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> used {{depends on}} the type coffee purchased. Green beans store the best in cooled {{airtight}} containers, and can easily last in this state for a year without losing flavor. [...] Roasted whole beans are best stored in airtight containers out of the light. The best material choices for the container are ceramic, or opaque glass. Plastic and metal may alter {{the flavor of the}} coffee bean. [...] In addition, for the first week of storage, containers should be opened or vented by a relief valve to release the carbon dioxide gas that will be produced by the roasted beans to prevent the gas from changing the quality of the coffee. [...] Whole bean roasted coffee stored in this manner will last for about two weeks. The advisability of freezing roasted beans is controversial. [...] Those advocating freezing believe that the flavour can then last for one to two months. [...] If beans are frozen, leaving them frozen until brewing best preserves the flavour of the coffee. Frozen beans will grind the same as unfrozen beans, but refreezing beans alters the quality of the coffee. [...] Coffee grounds are stored in airtight ceramic or glass containers, like roasted beans. Due to increased total surface area of coffee grounds, the grounds go stale in days, rather than weeks. In addition, freezing has no effect in increasing the storage life of coffee grounds.|$|E
