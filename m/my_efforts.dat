But I determined that <b>my</b> <b>efforts</b> should never cease till these dear souls, for whom I had so great an interest, yielded to God. Several entire nights were spent by me in earnest prayer for those whom I had sought out and brought together for the purpose of laboring and praying with them.|$|E

500|$|The Manfred Symphony {{would cost}} Tchaikovsky more time, effort and soul-searching than {{anything}} else he would write, even the Pathetique Symphony. It also became the longest, most complex work he had written up to that point, and though it owes an obvious debt to Berlioz due to its program, Tchaikovsky {{was still able to}} make the theme of Manfred his own. Near the end of seven months of intensive effort, in late September 1885, he wrote Balakirev, [...] "Never in my life, believe me, have I labored so long and hard, and felt so drained by <b>my</b> <b>efforts.</b> The Symphony is written in four movements, as per your program, although—forgive me—as much as I wanted to, I {{have not been able to}} keep all the keys and modulations you suggested ... It is of course dedicated to you".|$|E
500|$|Practising {{throughout}} 1899 and 1900, Bosanquet {{began to}} use the googly in minor matches before using it in important cricket. His first use of the new delivery in first-class cricket came in the match against Leicestershire in 1900 in which he scored two centuries. In the second innings, Samuel Coe had scored 98 when Bosanquet, still known as a fast-bowler, bowled his off break; the ball bounced four times and the batsman was stumped (although, writing in 1925, Bosanquet recalled Coe had been bowled). Bosanquet later wrote that the wicket [...] "was rightly treated as a joke, and {{was the subject of}} ribald comment". Middlesex captains permitted him to try googlies if there was little pressure on, but he later wrote: [...] "Though I could claim some five or six wickets before the close of the season, <b>my</b> <b>efforts</b> produced far more laughter than dismay in the hearts of opposing batsmen". But Bosanquet persisted with the delivery and soon began to be noticed by influential cricketers who recognised the potential of the googly. Previously, some bowlers occasionally bowled unintended googlies, but were unable to control them. Although batsmen were accustomed to off break or leg break bowlers, it was an unprecedented problem to face a bowler who could bowl both types of delivery at will, disguising which one he bowled. Bosanquet persuaded teammates to remain silent as he wished to maintain the impression that his off break was an accident so that batsmen were not expecting it. He further tried to play down his successes: he feigned surprise, acting as if they were similarly accidental.|$|E
500|$|The Workmans' {{exploration}} of the Rose Glacier and the 45-mile-long (72km) Siachen Glacier in Baltistan around Masherbrum in 1911 and 1912 {{was the most important}} achievement of their careers because it was the widest and longest subpolar glacier in the world and at the time, the least explored and accessible glacier as well. For two months, the Workmans explored the 45-mile glacier, climbed several mountains, and mapped the area. They spent the entire time over , [...] the high point being Indira Col, which they summitted and named. On this expedition, one of their Italian guides fell into a crevasse and died; Fanny was lucky to escape. The others were badly shaken but decided to carry on. Fanny led them across the Sia La pass (...) near the head of the Siachen Glacier and through a previously unexplored region to the Kaberi Glacier. This exploration and the resulting book were among her greatest accomplishments. As she wrote in her book about the trip, Two Summers in the Ice-Wilds of Eastern Karakoram, she organized and led this expedition: [...] "Dr. Hunter Workman accompanied me, this time, in charge with me of commissariat and as photographer and glacialist, but I was the responsible leader of this expedition, and on <b>my</b> <b>efforts,</b> in a large measure, must depend {{the success or failure of}} it". At one 21,000-foot (6,400 m) plateau, Fanny unfurled a [...] "Votes for Women" [...] newspaper and her husband snapped an iconic picture. [...] They took trained Alpine guides and surveyors including Grant Peterkin and Surjan Singh, whose contributions ensured that, unlike numerous other maps the Workmans helped create, their map of the Siachen Glacier remained unchallenged for many years.|$|E
