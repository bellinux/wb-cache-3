40|$|Modern {{photoengraving}} {{methods can}} generate forged prints really similar to original ones. Till recently, {{in order to}} distinguish between these fakes and original prints, art historian specialized in art prints have been using only magnifiers (magnifying lenses). The aim {{of the present study}} was to set up a scientific method based on non-invasive techniques to find out differences between photoengraving reproducing etching of the century XVIII and original etching of the century XVII, and to document them. To this aim, several devices were tested: IR reflectography, Portable X-Ray Fluorescence Analyzers (XRF) and optical microscope. We aimed at analysing mainly the kind ink used and the lines. We chose not to analyse the kind of used paper, since for forged prints antique paper can be used as support. The IR response of the two kinds of print, was found to be not relevant. Ink components, as analysed by XRF were not to be distinguished between the ones used for photoenvravings and for the original prints. With the microscope, small areas showing lines were investigated with a 10 X enlargement. Obtained <b>macrophotographies</b> allowed to point out a lot of differences between the two prints. The main ones were: the thickness of the ink, which is greater on originals than on fakes, the kind of light reflection: on originals light is absorbed (ink is dull) while on fakes light is specularly reflected (ink is bright and it seems without consistence), moreover thin and continuous lines in original prints can result broken in forged prints. While the other investigation methods were considered not useful in this study case, microscope gave good results that are easy to achieve and to understand. It represents an easy way of investigation. Microscope can be considered helpful to support art historian during their investigation, and it provides a reliable and affordable way to document the differences between photoengravings and original prints...|$|R

50|$|When a {{polished}} flat sample reveals traces of its microstructure, it is normal {{to capture the}} image using <b>macrophotography.</b> More sophisticated microstructure examination involves higher powered instruments: optical microscopy, electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and so on, some involving preparation of the material sample (cutting, microtomy, polishing, etching, vapor-deposition etc.).

5000|$|An {{important}} aim of fractography is {{to establish}} and examine the origin of cracking, as examination at the origin may reveal the cause of crack initiation. Initial fractographic examination is commonly carried out on a macro scale utilising low power optical microscopy and oblique lighting techniques to identify the extent of cracking, possible modes and likely origins.

50|$|The stereo or {{stereoscopic}} or {{dissecting microscope}} is an optical microscope variant designed for low magnification observation of a sample, typically using light reflected {{from the surface}} of an object rather than transmitted through it. The instrument uses two separate optical paths with two objectives and eyepieces to provide slightly different viewing angles to the left and right eyes. This arrangement produces a three-dimensional visualization of the sample being examined.

By metering light in real time off the film plane the OM-2 was able to adjust exposure if light levels changed during exposure. By eliminating flash metering via a built-in photocell on a flash unit the OTF system was able to meter more accurately, and also significantly simplify multi-flash shooting as {{it was no longer}} necessary to calculate and factor-in exposure for multiple light sources.

50|$|Analysis of trace {{materials}} {{most often}} {{begins with a}} visual examination of the evidence usually involving <b>macrophotography.</b> This is then usually followed by microscopic analysis, of which {{a number of different}} types are available {{depending on the type of}} material to be analysed, such as a stereomicroscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM) or comparison microscope. SEM is especially useful because X-ray analysis can be conducted on selected areas of the sample, so is a form of microanalysis. It is useful where chemical residues can show unusual elements present which may indicate chemical attack of the product. A car accident caused by a diesel fuel leak, for example, showed traces of sulfur on the cracked tube indicative of attack by sulfuric acid from the battery.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variation}} of <b>macrophotography</b> involves using the scanner to produce stereoscopic or [...] "3D" [...] images of small objects. This {{is made possible}} because of the optical system of a typical scanner, which uses prisms to put the sensor at an optical distance from the glass of 3 to 4 feet, allowing a small sensor to cover the entire width of the bed, while keeping the bed physically shallow. This also gives better than expected depth of field, and introduces {{a certain amount of}} parallax when the same object appears at different positions on the bed. This allows the generation of stereo pairs, much like the [...] "shift" [...] technique where a single camera is shifted to produce right and left views of a still life scene.|$|E
5000|$|Monorail camera - This is {{the most}} common type of studio view camera, with front and rear {{standards}} mounted to a single rail that is fixed to a camera support. This design gives the greatest range of movements and flexibility, with both front and rear standards able to tilt, shift, rise, fall, and swing in similar proportion. These are generally made of metal with leather or synthetic bellows, and are difficult to pack for travel. Sinar and Toyo are popular manufacturers of monorail view camera systems. ARCA-Swiss produces monorail cameras for field use in addition to models for the more conventional studio applications. Many manufacturers also offer monorail extensions that move the front or rear standards farther away from each other to facilitate focusing on close objects (<b>macrophotography).</b>|$|E

The 45 mm and 85 mm “Micro” lenses offer close focus (0.5 {{magnification}}) for <b>macrophotography.</b> In 2016, Nikon added the PC NIKKOR 19mm f/4E ED extra wide angle view lens with a magnification factor of 0.18 and 25 cm focus distance. The PC-E lenses offer automatic aperture control with the Nikon D3, D300, and D700 cameras. With some earlier camera models, a PC-E lens operates like a regular Nikon PC (non-E) lens, with preset aperture control {{by means of a}} pushbutton; with other earlier models, no aperture control is provided, and the lens is not usable.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there had}} been {{speculation}} in the trade press over a future Super Rolleiflex for some time, {{it was not until}} 1966 that the SL66 finally appeared, SL being an abbreviation for single lens. It was a sophisticated system camera, a camera at the heart of an extensive range of interchangeable components. The SL66 had built-in bellows, as well as a pivoting front (lens) standard that could be tilted back and forth by 8°, thus allowing the region of sharpness to be manipulated according to the Scheimpflug principle. In addition, the lens could be mounted in reverse, thereby enabling <b>macrophotography</b> without additional equipment. With the normal lens reversed and the bellows extended by 50 mm, close-up photography with a magnification ratio of 1.5× was possible.

50|$|Thermoplastics, thermosets, and {{composites}} can {{be analyzed}} using FTIR and UV spectroscopy as well as NMR and ESEM. Failed samples can either be dissolved in a suitable solvent and examined directly (UV, IR and NMR sepctroscopy) or as a thin film cast from solvent or cut using microtomy from the solid product.

Fractured products can be examined using fractography, an especially useful method for all fractured components using <b>macrophotography</b> and optical microscopy. Although polymers usually possess quite different properties to metals and ceramics, they are just as susceptible to failure from mechanical overload, fatigue and stress corrosion cracking if products are poorly designed or manufactured. Many plastics are susceptible to attack by active chemicals like chlorine, present at low levels in potable water supplies, especially if the injection mouldings are faulty.|$|E
5000|$|... 1936: E. Leitz PLOOT (Germany): first reflex {{housing for}} 35 mm {{rangefinder}} cameras. For use with a Leica IIIa RF and the Leitz 20 cm f/4.5 Telyt or 40 cm f/5 Telyt long focus lenses (all Germany). Long focus (and telephoto) lenses have very shallow {{depth of field}} and the short baseline rangefinders built into RF cameras cannot triangulate the subject distance accurately enough for acceptably sharp focusing. SLRs do not suffer from this problem, because they are focused by directly assessing the sharpness of the lens image - the lens serves as its own rangefinder. Reflex housings converted RFs into very awkward SLRs by inserting a reflex mirror and focusing screen between the lens and camera. Some even had image reversing optics. They also solved the RF camera's parallax error problem in <b>macrophotography.</b> Eventually, real SLRs were recognized as the simpler solution and supplanted RFs in the 1960s. The last reflex housing for a film camera, the Leica Visoflex III (West Germany; for Leica M4 series RFs), was discontinued in 1984.|$|E
40|$|Fluorescence <b>macrophotography</b> {{was used}} for the {{evaluation}} of colloidal transport and deposition in silica sand and sandy soil packed columns. With the fluorescence <b>macrophotography</b> technique, the number of microspheres and its macroscopic distribution on a column cross section is derived from an image of the fluorescence intensity of the surface. Column experiments with varying flow velocity and input concentration of microspheres lead to conditions with high deposition or high breakthrough of the colloids. In comparison with established microscopic fluorescent techniques the presented novel methodology was found to deliver similar estimates of particle concentrations and similar detection limits. Moreover, unlike with fluorescent microscopic method, the fluorescent <b>macrophotography</b> technique provides valuable information about the spatial distribution of microspheres. The Sulforhodamine-B, a frequently applied organic dye to label the microspheres, limits the applicability of fluorescence <b>macrophotography</b> technique due to self-quenching effects which occur at high particle concentration. At high proximity of the fluorescent microspheres self-quenching effects led to underestimation of microsphere concentration as well as incorrect depth profiles. Very recent developed microspheres, labelled with rare-earth-ion-chelate-complexes overcome this limitation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V [...] All rights reserved...|$|E
