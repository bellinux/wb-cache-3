5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet <b>metal</b> <b>pans</b> as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|E

5000|$|An unblech, or K'Deira Blech (lit. [...] "pot blech", {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "water blech"), is also used to heat up pre-cooked food on the Sabbath, but utilizes different halakhic mechanisms from a standard blech. An unblech consists of a shallow <b>metal</b> <b>pan</b> filled with hot water and covered by another <b>metal</b> <b>pan,</b> and thus is akin to a pot of warm food for halakhic purposes. As such, it may be more flexible than a standard blech for halachic purposes. However, the temperature of an unblech is limited by the boiling point of water and is not as hot as a typical blech.|$|R

50|$|Salt pans are shallow open, often <b>metal,</b> <b>pans</b> used to {{evaporate}} brine {{for the production}} of salts. They are usually found close to the source of the salt. For example, pans used in the solar evaporation of salt from sea water are usually found on the coast, while those used to extract salt from solution-mined brine will be found near to the brine shaft. In this case, extra heat is often provided by lighting fires underneath.|$|E

From the 17th century, sadirons or sad irons (from Middle English [...] "sad" [...] meaning of [...] "solid", used in modern English through the 1800s) began to be used. They were thick slabs of cast iron, delta-shaped and with a handle, heated in a fire or on a stove. These were also called flat irons. A later design consisted of an iron box which could be filled with hot coals, {{which had to be}} periodically aerated by attaching a bellows. In Kerala in India, burning coconut shells were used instead of charcoal, as they have a similar heating capacity. This method is still in use as a backup device, since power outages are frequent. Other box irons had heated metal inserts instead of hot coals.|$|E

50|$|Two urns reside on {{the south}} side of the district, between Jackson Place and Madison Place. They each stand at 5 feet tall by 4 feet wide, and are made of bronze with granite bases. The sides of the urns are {{decorated}} with classical female figures. The urns were part of the original park plan as designed by Andrew Jackson Downing in 1852. They may have been designed by Downing, or his assistant Calvert Vaux. The urns were cast in a New York foundry at the orders of George M. Robeson, who was Secretary of the United States Navy at the time. The urns were originally placed on granite bases in the center of two small flower beds to the east and west sides of the Andrew Jackson statue. In 1879, they were fitted with <b>metal</b> <b>pans</b> which allowed them to be used as flower pots. The park was redesigned in 1936, and the urns were moved to their current location.|$|E

40|$|Research on the {{efficiency}} of silicone bakeware is limited. Manufacturers claim that silicone bakeware is nonstick, has easy product release and even heat distribution. This study attempted to replicate consumer baking conditions through a comparison of muffins baked in silicone pans to muffins baked in nonstick, anodized aluminum dark-colored <b>metal</b> <b>pans</b> (‘nonsilicone’). Using a consumer corn-muffin mix, structured baking procedures and controlled tests were performed, such as measures of the top surface browning, texture, water activity and heat transfer coefficient of the pans. The results of the tests indicated that silicone muffin pans did not produce a better product; rather, they were moister, had greater volume, with top-crust texture and color significantly less than muffins baked in nonsilicone muffin pans...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to determine whether the}} particle size of the starting collagen powder or the material of molds used during freeze-drying had effects on the scaffold pore structure. Collagen particles were separated by size prior to slurry making using a sieve with 1000 [mu]m openings, and scaffolds were made using both <b>metal</b> <b>pans</b> and polysulfone trays, two commonly used molds. The mean and variation of pore diameter and interconnectivity of freeze-dried scaffolds were compared to determine the relationship between particle size or mold material and the resulting pore diameter, for a specific same freeze-drying condition (viz., temperature). Knowing these relationships will permit a better control of pore size during fabrication, allowing researchers to design scaffolds with greater predictability and specificity. by Jenny K. Chan.

30|$|The {{formulation}} {{aimed for}} products {{that had an}} energy distribution of carbohydrate, protein, and fat at 60, 15 and 25  kcal/ 100  kcal, respectively. Their protein qualities should be comparable to requirements set in the latest WHO technical report (World Health Organization 2007). Energies from saturated fatty acid and free sugar were less than 8 % and 10 %, respectively (World Health Organization 2002 b). The carbohydrate sources should be low on the glycemic index. The product prototypes included: (i) flake snack, (ii) instant beverage, and (iii) instant soup. All ingredients, except for rice bran oil, sugar, and acesulfame K, were analyzed for protein, fat, carbohydratecontents and amino acid profile. As carbohydrate sources, rice flour, brown rice flour, and mung bean starch were cooked on electric double-sided flat <b>metal</b> <b>pans</b> in order to simulate cooking with a drum dryer, and then used in the in-vitro carbohydrate digestibility test. To combine data from the analyses and nutrient data base (Puwasatien et al. 1999), the formulation was performed by using the mass-balance equation.|$|E
5000|$|Boiler designs vary. Simple metal {{containers}} in {{the shape}} of a box or cylinder are common. A more efficient boiler can be made by using a <b>metal</b> <b>pan</b> whose top is a slightly concave diaphragm made out of a very thin, springy metal. Many pop pop boats have used a single tube of metal, which is formed into a coil in its center and left straight on both ends to form the exhausts. The coil in this version functions as the boiler.|$|R
5000|$|Around 1620, in England, Cornelius Drebbel made {{an early}} oar-powered submarine. To re-oxygenate the air inside it, he likely {{generated}} oxygen by heating saltpetre (potassium nitrate) in a <b>metal</b> <b>pan</b> to emit oxygen. Heating turns the saltpetre into potassium oxide or hydroxide, which absorbs carbon dioxide from the air.

25|$|It is {{possible}} for metal objects to be microwave-oven compatible, although experimentation by users is not encouraged. Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow <b>metal</b> <b>pan,</b> usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal wire racks {{can be part of}} the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior wall plates with perforating holes which allow light and air into the oven, and allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} gain recognition, there was a {{struggle}} for female artists to [...] "de-gender" [...] their work {{to compete in a}} historically male-dominated art world. If a work did not [...] "look" [...] like it was made by a woman, then the stigma associated with women would not cling on to the work itself, thus giving it its own integrity. For instance, In 1963 Yayoi Kusama created Oven-Pan- part of a larger collection of works she referred to as the “aggregation sculptures”. As with other works from that collection, Oven-Pan takes an object associated with women’s work- in this case a metal pan- and completely covers it with bulbous lumps of the same material. Here we see an early feminist example of female artists finding ways to break from the traditional role of women in society. Having the lumps made from the same color and material as the <b>metal</b> <b>pan</b> completely takes away the pan's functionality, and- in a metaphorical sense- its association with women. The protrusions remove the item’s gender by not only removing its function of being a <b>metal</b> <b>pan</b> women would use in the kitchen, but by also making it ugly. Before this era, common female work consisted of “pretty” and decorative things like landscapes and quilts whereas now the artwork has become bold- even rebellious.|$|R

The original producer/director, John Howard Davies, explains that he made Basil use a metal one and that he was responsible for most of the violence on the show, which he felt was essential to the type of comical farce they were creating. Later, when Sachs's clothes were treated to give off smoke after he escapes the burning kitchen in [...] "The Germans", the corrosive chemicals ate through them and gave Sachs severe burns.|$|R
