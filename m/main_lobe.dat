25|$|The product T.B {{gives the}} {{compression}} {{ratio of the}} system and it equates, approximately, to the improvement in signal to noise ratio of the <b>main</b> <b>lobe</b> of the compressed pulse relative to that of the original chirp.|$|E
2500|$|In {{parabolic}} antennas, {{virtually all}} the power radiated is concentrated in a narrow <b>main</b> <b>lobe</b> along the antenna's axis. [...] The residual power is radiated in sidelobes, usually much smaller, in other directions. [...] Because in parabolic antennas the reflector aperture is {{much larger than the}} wavelength, due to diffraction there are usually many narrow sidelobes, so the sidelobe pattern is complex. [...] There is also usually a backlobe, in the opposite direction to the <b>main</b> <b>lobe,</b> due to the spillover radiation from the feed antenna that misses the reflector.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{different}} concerns when the time-bandwidth product is small. [...] When [...] T×B {{is less than}} about 75, the windowing process is not altogether successful, especially when it is applied only within the compressor. [...] In such a situation, even though the close-in sidelobes are lowered by the anticipated amount, further away from the <b>main</b> <b>lobe</b> the sidelobes are found to increase in amplitude once more. [...] These sidelobes tend to reach a maximum at locations ±T/2 {{on each side of}} the <b>main</b> <b>lobe</b> of the compressed pulse and they are a consequence of the Fresnel ripples present on the frequency spectrum. [...] This topic is discussed in more detail later.|$|E
40|$|Without any {{relative}} moves or beam scanning, {{the novel}} Orbital-Angular-Momentum- (OAM-) based radar targets detection technique using uniform concentric circular arrays (UCCAs) shows the azimuthal estimation ability, which provides new perspective for radar system design. However, the main estimation method, that is, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), under this scheme suffers from low resolution. As a solution, this paper rebuilds the OAM-based radar targets detection model and introduces the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm {{to improve the}} resolution for detecting targets within the <b>main</b> <b>lobes.</b> The spatial smoothing technique is proposed to tackle the coherent problem brought by the proposed model. Analytical study and simulation demonstrate the superresolution estimation capacity the MUSIC algorithm can achieve for detecting targets within the <b>main</b> <b>lobes.</b> The performance of the MUSIC algorithm to detect targets not illuminated by the <b>main</b> <b>lobes</b> is further evaluated. Despite the fact that MUSIC algorithm loses the resolution advantage under this case, its estimation is more robust {{than that of the}} FFT method. Overall, the proposed MUSIC algorithm for the OAM-based radar system demonstrates the superresolution ability for detecting targets within the <b>main</b> <b>lobes</b> and good robustness for targets out of the <b>main</b> <b>lobes...</b>|$|R

2500|$|For {{very large}} Doppler values (up to 10% of system bandwidth), time sidelobes {{are found to}} increase. [...] In these cases Doppler {{tolerance}} can be improved by introducing small frequency extensions onto the spectra of the compressed pulses. [...] The penalty for doing this is, either, an increase in <b>main</b> <b>lobe</b> width, or an increase in bandwidth requirements.|$|E
2500|$|As can be seen, at high {{values of}} TB, the plots match the sinc {{characteristic}} closely, but at low values, significant differences can be seen. [...] As already stated, these degradations in the waveforms, at low TB values, are because the spectral characteristics {{are no longer}} truly rectangular. [...] In all cases, the close-in sidelobe levels are consistently high, at about -13.5nbsp&dB relative to the <b>main</b> <b>lobe.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{sidelobe}} {{level has}} been much reduced, there are some undesirable consequences of the weighting process. [...] Firstly, there is an overall loss of gain, with the peak amplitude of the <b>main</b> <b>lobe</b> reduced by about 5.4dB and, secondly, the half-power beam width of the main pulse has increased by nearly 50%. [...] In, say, a radar system, these effects would cause loss of range and reduced range resolution, respectively.|$|E

Carr’s material is rather well preserved, with one calyx clearly showing division into two <b>main</b> <b>lobes,</b> and another having two <b>main</b> <b>lobes</b> with apical tears.

2500|$|In general, {{the more}} the {{sidelobe}} levels are lowered, the broader the <b>main</b> <b>lobe</b> will become. [...] However, the various windowing functions do perform differently from one other, with some giving main lobes which are unnecessarily broad for the sidelobe levels achieved. [...] The most efficient function is the Dolph-Chebyshev window (see Window functions) as this gives the narrowest pulse at a given sidelobe level. [...] A selection of the better performing windowing functions are shown in the graph of Beamwidth × Bandwidth as sidelobe level.|$|E
2500|$|Consider {{first the}} {{compressed}} pulse when TB = 250, which {{is shown in}} the left-hand figure below. [...] For this result no weighting has been applied to the transmit pulse, but the full Hamming weighting has been applied in the compressor. [...] As can be seen, the close-in sidelobe levels are consistent with the Hamming weighting (-42dB), but further out, the sidelobe levels rise to a peak value of -45dB at T/2 each side of the <b>main</b> <b>lobe.</b> [...] In the right-hand figure, where TB =25, the problems with the far-out sidelobes are much more serious.
