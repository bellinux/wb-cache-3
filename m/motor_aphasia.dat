40|$|Background: Factors {{affecting}} {{the quality of}} life (QOL) may be different between young and old stroke patients. However, these issues have not yet been properly investigated. Methods: We identified 170 young-onset stroke patients (onset between 15 and 45 years of age) who were admitted to the Asan Medical Center. Three hundred and forty follow-up period matched, old-onset stroke patients (onset> 45 years of age) were chosen as a control group. A follow-up interview was performed 1 ~ 5 years after the onset of stroke in 96 young patients and 160 old patients. With the use of standardized questionnaire, we assessed physical disabilities, activity of daily living (Barthel Index Score, modified Rankin scale), the presence of depression (using DSM IV criteria and Beck Depression Inventory) and socio-economic/job status. The QOL was assessed using the Stroke Specific QOL developed by Williams et al. Results: The QOL scores were significantly higher in young patients than in old ones. Univariate analysis showed that factors related to low QOL included unemployment, <b>motor</b> impairment, <b>aphasia,</b> dysarthria, dysaphagia and severe modified Rankin score in young patients while poor economic status, unemployment, supratentorial (vs. infratentorial) stroke, anterior (vs. posterior) circulation stroke, the presence of diabetes mellitus, <b>motor</b> impairment, <b>aphasia,</b> dysarthria, dysphagia, visual field defect, severe modified Rankin score, the presence of post-stroke seizures and depression were related to the low QOL in old patients.

40|$|In {{a patient}} with a {{unilateral}} embolic infarct in the left posterior thalamo-subthalamic paramedian artery territory, neuropathological studies showed involvement of the intralaminar, dorsomedial, and internal part of the ventral posterior nuclei of the thalamus, of the rostral part of the mesencephalic reticular formation, and of the posterior commissure. The patient showed upgaze palsy for voluntary saccades, smooth pursuit and vestibulo-ocular movements, sustained downgaze, right-sided motor hemineglect and facio-brachial hypaesthesia, <b>motor</b> transcortical <b>aphasia</b> and anterograde amnesia. This case confirms that unilateral destruction of the posterior commissure, rostral interstitial nucleus of the MLF and interstitial nucleus of Cajal produces a non-dissociated upgaze palsy.

Aims: This single case study set out to describe the effect of a 30 mg dose of bromocriptine on the behaviour, cognition and linguistic skills of a person with aphasia post-cerebrovascular accident. Methods & Procedures: The participant received speech and language therapy alone and combined with the drug. Four testing points were made {{to examine the effects of}} bromocriptine: (1) at baseline before the drug was administered, (2) once the drug reached 30 mg dosage, (3) after the combined speech and language therapy and drug regime and (4) after drug and therapy withdrawal. Outcomes & Results: The participant responded on all behavioural measures to the use of bromocriptine. The combined use of speech and language therapy with bromocriptine provided clear improvements in the participant?s overall behaviours and specifically in her verbal output.

40|$|Background: Patients with {{an acute}} ischemic stroke rated as mild, {{and for this}} reason not {{submitted}} to thrombolysis, have an unfavorable outcome in a non-negligible proportion. Whether selective presentation features help identify those at risk of bad outcome, and whether it could be recommended to treat only patients with such features, is poorly elucidated. We report our experience based on retrospective evaluation of a consecutive series of patients scoring 6 or less on baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), some of whom received thrombolysis. Methods: From the prospective Careggi Hospital Stroke Registry, Florence, Italy, we selected a series of patients who fulfilled the following criteria: (1) screening for treatment within 3 hours of symptom onset; (2) mild symptoms, defined as a score of 6 or less on NIHSS, with or without rapid improvement; (3) no other reason for exclusion from thrombolysis; (4) no previous disability; and (5) admission to the stroke unit.

40|$|Background and objective. Proportional {{recovery}} of upper-extremity <b>motor</b> function and <b>aphasia</b> after stroke may suggest common mechanisms for spontaneous neurobiological recovery. This study aimed to investigate if the proportional recovery rule {{also applies to}} visuospatial neglect (VSN) in right-hemispheric first-ever ischemic stroke patients and explored the possible common underlying mechanisms. Methods. Patients with upper-limb paresis and VSN were included. Recovery defined as the change in Letter Cancellation Test (LCT) score at ∼ 8 days and 6 months poststroke. Potential recovery defined as LCTmax-LCTinitial = 20 â' LCTinitial. Hierarchical clustering separated fitters and nonfitters of the prediction rule. A cutoff value on LCTmax-LCTinitial was determined. The change in LCT and Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity was expressed {{as a percentage of}} the total possible score to investigate the communality of proportional recovery. Results. Out of 90 patients, 80 displayed proportional {{recovery of}} VSN (ie, "fitters," 0. 97; 95 % CI = 0. 82 - 1. 12). All patients who did not follow the prediction rule for VSN (ie, "nonfitters") had ≥ 15 missing O's at baseline and failed to show proportional recovery of the upper limb. Conclusions. This study shows that the proportional recovery rule also applies to patients with VSN poststroke. Patients who fail to show proportional recovery of VSN are the same patients who fail to show proportional recovery of the upper limb. These findings support the idea of common intrahemispheric mechanisms underlying spontaneous neurobiological recovery in the first months poststroke. Future studies should investigate the prognostic clinical and neurobiological markers of these subgroups...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{attempted}} to correlate neurologic changes in awake patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) under cervical block anesthesia (CBA) with electroencephalography (EEG) and measurement of carotid artery stump pressure (SP). MethodsContinuous EEG and SP monitoring was measured prospectively in 314 consecutive patients undergoing CEA between April 1, 2003, and July 30, 2006, under CBA. Indications for CEA were asymptomatic 70 % to 99 % {{internal carotid artery}} stenosis in 242 (77. 1 %), transient ischemic attacks (including transient monocular blindness) in 45 (14. 3 %), and prior stroke in 27 (8. 6 %). Mean common carotid artery pressure before clamping, mean SP after carotid clamping, and intraarterial pressure were continuously monitored in all patients. An indwelling shunt was placed when neurologic events (contralateral <b>motor</b> weakness, <b>aphasia,</b> loss of consciousness, or seizures) occurred, regardless of SP or EEG changes. ResultsShunt placement was necessary because of neurologic changes in 10 % (32 / 314) of all CEAs performed under CBA. Only 3 patients (1. 4 %) of 216 required shunt placement if SP was 50 mm Hg or more, vs 29 (29. 6 %) of 98 if SP was less than 50 mm Hg (P <. 00001; sensitivity, 29. 8 %; specificity, 98. 6 %). In patients with SP of 40 mm Hg or more, 7 (2. 6 %) of 270 required shunt placement, vs 25 (56. 8 %) of 44 if SP was less than 40 mm Hg (P <. 00001; sensitivity, 56. 8 %; specificity, 97. 4 %). Ischemic EEG changes were observed in 19 (59. 4 %) of 32 patients (false-negative rate, 40. 6 %) requiring shunt placement under CBA. Three patients had false-positive EEG results and did not require shunt placement (false-positive rate, 1. 0 %). The perioperative stroke/death rate was 4 (1. 2 %) in 314. All strokes occurred after surgery and were unrelated to cerebral ischemia or lack of shunt placement. ConclusionsTen percent of patients required a shunt placement during CEA under CBA. Shunt placement was necessary in 56. 8 % of patients with SP less than 40 mm Hg. EEG identified cerebral ischemia in only 59. 4 % of patients needing shunt placement, with a false-positive rate of 1. 0 % and a false-negative rate of 40. 6 %.

50|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of transcortical <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia</b> are typically recognized first by a neurologist after a stroke or a type of brain injury. If TMoA is suspected, the neurologist will refer the individual to a speech-language pathologist (SLP) to complete a comprehensive evaluation of the patient. A comprehensive evaluation most often includes the use of standardized and/or nonstandardized tests to evaluate the individual's overall communication and language skills. These tests will look for the patient's ability to speak, listen, read, write, understand and use their language, as well as the ability to swallow. During the evaluation, the SLP will determine the individual's strengths and deficits in communication and the impact of the deficits on the person's quality of life. This comprehensive evaluation will help professionals to determine the proper diagnosis for the individual. The key characteristic for the diagnosis of TMoA is the patient's ability to repeat. The ability to easily repeat speech is a leading factor when differentiating TMoA from other diagnoses of aphasia. Likely, when an individual's repetition is spared after a stroke or brain injury, a professional will diagnose the patient with transcortical <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia.</b>|$|E
40|$|Models {{of normal}} word {{production}} are well specified {{about the effects}} of frequency of linguistic stimuli on lexical access, but are less clear regarding the same effects on later stages of word production, particularly word articulation. In aphasia, this lack of specificity of down-stream frequency effects is even more noticeable because there is relatively limited amount of data on the time course of frequency effects for this population. This study begins to fill this gap by comparing the effects of variation of word frequency (lexical, whole word) and bigram frequency (sub-lexical, within word) on word production abilities in ten normal speakers and eight mild–moderate individuals with aphasia. In an immediate repetition paradigm, participants repeated single monosyllabic words in which word frequency (high or low) was crossed with bigram frequency (high or low). Indices for mapping the time course for these effects included reaction time (RT) for linguistic processing and motor preparation, and word duration (WD) for speech motor performance (word articulation time). The results indicated that individuals with aphasia had significantly longer RT and WD compared to normal speakers. RT showed a significant main effect only for word frequency (i. e., high-frequency words had shorter RT). WD showed significant main effects of word and bigram frequency; however, contrary to our expectations, high-frequency items had longer WD. Further investigation of WD revealed that independent of the influence of word and bigram frequency, vowel type (tense or lax) had the expected effect on WD. Moreover, individuals with aphasia differed from control speakers in their ability to implement tense vowel duration, even though they could produce an appropriate distinction between tense and lax vowels. The results highlight the importance of using temporal measures to identify subtle deficits in linguistic and speech <b>motor</b> processing in <b>aphasia,</b> the crucial role of phonetic characteristics of stimuli set in studying speech production and the need for the language production models to account more explicitly for word articulation...|$|R

The evidence-based analysis included only studies based on repeated tDCS sessions with sham tDCS control procedure; 25 patients or more having received active treatment was required for Class I, while a lower number of 10 - 24 patients was accepted for Class II studies. Current evidence does not allow making any recommendation of Level A (definite efficacy) for any indication. Level B recommendation (probable efficacy) is proposed for: (i) anodal tDCS of the left primary motor cortex (M 1) (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in fibromyalgia; (ii) anodal tDCS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in major depressive episode without drug resistance; (iii) anodal tDCS of the right DLPFC (with left DLPFC cathode) in addiction/craving. Level C recommendation (possible efficacy) is proposed for anodal tDCS of the left M 1 (or contralateral to pain side, with right orbitofrontal cathode) in chronic lower limb neuropathic pain secondary to spinal cord lesion. Conversely, Level B recommendation (probable inefficacy) is conferred on the absence of clinical effects of: (i) anodal tDCS of the left temporal cortex (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in tinnitus; (ii) anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in drug-resistant major depressive episode. It remains to be clarified whether the probable or possible therapeutic effects of tDCS are clinically meaningful and how to optimally perform tDCS in a therapeutic setting. In addition, the easy management and low cost of tDCS devices allow at home use by the patient, but this might raise ethical and legal concerns with regard to potential misuse or overuse. We must be careful to avoid inappropriate applications of this technique by ensuring rigorous training of the professionals and education of the patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The arcuate {{fasciculus}} (AF) is a {{key component}} for language repetition Neuroimaging evidence indicates a gender-dimorphic architecture of this white matter tract. Strong left lateralization of the direct segment of the AF is m∼ore frequent in men (85 %), while mild lateralization or symmetrical bilateral ∼ representation (60 %) is more prevalent amongst women. Therefore, most men {{do not have a}} well-developed right AF. This predicts that men with aphasia and left hemisphere damage will have less capacity than aphasic women to compensate repetition deficits and, consequently, aphasias associated to repetition deficits (e. g conduction aphasia – CA) will be more prevalent in men. While this assumption is intuitively appealing, it has not been empirically tested up to now. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published cases of CA and transcortical aphasia (TA) was performed. Adult patients with first-ever unilateral cerebrovascular event and no prior history of neurological or psychiatric disease were included in the database. The men: women proportion of CA and TA was calculated from the database, and compared with the men:women proportion of stroke prevalence. The group of patients with aphasias showing relatively preserved repetition (transcortical <b>motor</b> and sensory <b>aphasias)</b> was used as control. Patients with mixed transcortical aphasia were excluded because repetition is not fully preserved. Results: Two hundred fifty three publications were included, gathering 799 cases of CA and TA. Males accounted for 74 % (n = 375) of CA subjects (n = 507), while among TA (n= 249, mixed TA excluded) men represented 62 % (n= 154) of subjects. Compared with 59 % of male prevalence in stroke, men were overrepresented amongst CA (p< 0. 0001, 95 % CI 68. 91 to 76. 82) in comparison with the control group (TA with exclusion of mixed TA, p= 0. 2848, 95 % CI 55. 50 to 67. 91). Discussion:Chronic repetition deficits are more prevalent in men than in women. This finding has important implications for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of aphasia in men, since verbal repetition is a major resource in language therapy. References: Catani M et al.

50|$|Watershed {{areas are}} found in the brain, where areas are perfused by both the {{anterior}} and middle cerebral arteries, and in the intestines, where areas are perfused by both the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries (i.e., splenic flexure). Additionally, the sigmoid colon and rectum form a watershed zone with blood supply from inferior mesenteric, pudendal and iliac circulations. Hypoperfusion in watershed areas can lead to mural and mucosal infarction in the case of ischemic bowel disease. When watershed stroke occurs in the brain, it produces unique focal neurologic symptoms that aid clinicians in diagnosis and localization. For example, a cerebral watershed area is situated in the dorsal prefrontal cortex; when it is affected on the left side, this can lead to transcortical <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{this rare}} type of aphasia, Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and the arcuate {{fasciculus}} are intact but the watershed region around them is damaged. This damage isolates these areas {{from the rest}} of the brain. The most frequent etiology of mixed transcortical aphasia is stenosis (narrowing) of the internal carotid artery. Mixed transcortical aphasia can also occur after cerebral hypoxia, cerebral swelling, and any stroke that affects the cerebral artery. Often lesions that cause mixed transcortical aphasia affect both the anterior and posterior perisylvian border zones. Some times the type of aphasia can be determined just by knowing the lesion location. In order for a patient to be diagnosed with mixed transcortical aphasia all other forms of transcortical must be ruled out. Using WAB or the BDAE can rule out global aphasia if the ability to repeat is present. If verbal fluency is depressed transcortical aphasia gets ruled out and if auditory processing and comprehension is weak then it cannot be transcortical <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia.</b>|$|E

Eighty-three patients-continent, independent in feeding and mental function within normal limits, with impaired motor capacity and/or dysphasia 5 - 7 days after acute stroke-were included in a randomized controlled trial; 41 were allocated to early supported discharge and continued rehabilitation at home (HRG) and 40 to routine rehabilitation (RRG).

Follow-up of patient outcome 3, 6 and 12 months after stroke included mortality, <b>motor</b> capacity, <b>aphasia,</b> activities of daily living, social activities, perceived dysfunction and self-reported falls. Patient satisfaction with health care was assessed at 3 months after stroke. Resource use over 12 months included inpatient hospital care, outpatient health care, use of health-related services in the municipality, informal care, and cost of health care. Observations, semi-structured interviews and documents were used to explore differences in the behavior of therapists and patients during rehabilitation sessions at home and in the hospital, as well as to describe the content and implementation of the intervention program. Support and continuity of rehabilitation throughout the levels of care-from the stroke unit to the patient's home-were provided by a multidisciplinary outreach team, from which one therapist was selected as case manager. The early supported discharge was aimed to coincide with the attainment of independence in toileting. The intervention program entailed an individualized rehabilitation program-varying in duration (mean= 14 weeks, range 4 - 29 after hospital discharge), frequency of home visits (mean 12 visits, range 3 - 3 1) and content- based on the patient's needs, and planned and carried out in partnership between the patient and the therapist. Face-to-face contact with the patient, which constituted 54 % of the total of 1093 h of the home rehabilitation program, was spent in dialogue and training. Self-directed training was performed an average of 1 1 / 2 h a day per patient. The intervention included counseling and guiding the spouse when needed. In the RRG 20 patients were discharged from the stroke unit to their homes and 18 were transferred to departments of geriatrics or rehabilitation, where they had at least 1142 contacts with members of the rehabilitation staff. The home of the patient was found to provide an environment more amenable than the hospital for a stroke rehabilitation session whose aim was promoting active patient participation and shared responsibility for the rehabilitation process. There were 2 losses and 1 death in the HRG, and 3 deaths but no losses in the RRG. At 1 year after stroke 77 patients- 39 in the HRG and 38 in the RRG-were followed-up. There was no difference in patient outcome. By multiple regression analysis intervention was suggested to {{have a significant effect on}} independence in activities of daily living. At 3 months patient satisfaction in the HRG was, with regard to participation in planning the rehabilitation, significantly better than in the RRG (P= 0. 021) and at least as good in all other domains. During the first year after stroke a significant difference in inpatient hospital care, initial and recurrent, was observed, with means of 18 (HRG) vs. 33 days (RRG) (P= 0. 002); while there was no difference in resource use of outpatient health care, home help service from the municipality or informal care. In Stockholm Sweden, early supported discharge with continued rehabilitation at home proved no less beneficial than routine rehabilitation for patients with moderate neurological impairments after stroke. The average cost of health care for 5 patients in the HRG during I year was similar to that for 4 patients in the RRG...|$|R
50|$|Transcortical <b>motor</b> <b>aphasia</b> (TMoA), {{also known}} as commissural {{dysphasia}} and white matter dysphasia, results from damage, typically due to cerebrovascular accident (CVA), in the anterior superior frontal lobe of the language-dominant hemisphere. The left hemisphere usually performs language functions, although left-handed individuals {{have been shown to}} perform language functions with both their right and left hemispheres. Damage in the watershed region does not directly damage the areas of the brain involved in language production or comprehension; instead, the damage isolates these areas {{from the rest of the}} brain. Due to damage in areas of the frontal lobe, executive functions related to language use are often affected in individuals with TMoA. Relevant executive functions include activating language responses and controlling syntax (grammar) and narrative discourse, which can lead to difficulties forming complex sentences, choosing which words to use appropriately, and initiating speech in conversation. The extent of brain damage will impact how much language functioning is impaired (i.e. damage deep to the frontal lobe and/or damage across multiple regions will greatly impair language). Right hemiparesis, which is right-sided paralysis, may occur along with TMoA if the lesion in the anterior frontal lobe is large enough and extends into the posterior frontal lobe. There are also other forms of aphasias that are a result of TMoA. Adynamic aphasia is one example; it is a form of TMoA characterized by sparse speech. Adynamic aphasia has normal spontaneous speech due to the fact that when new concepts are introduced by external stimuli, spontaneous speech improves. This is a result of executive functioning in the frontal lobe.|$|E
