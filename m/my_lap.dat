Bakshi recalled, [...] "All my friends were black, everyone we did business with was black, the school across the street was black. It was segregated, so everything was black.

500|$|Completing the field, Kazuki Nakajima was 16th, Nelson Piquet Jr. 17th, Rubens Barrichello 18th, whilst the Force Indias of Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella {{brought up}} {{the rear of the}} grid in 19th and 20th positions. Piquet later complained that he was blocked during his first-session run by Vettel: [...] "During <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> Vettel was in front of me, which {{unsettled}} me a little, although the FIA felt that he did not impede me." [...] Kovalainen was, however, penalized by the stewards and fined €5,000 for using a refuelling system during qualifying which had not been approved by the FIA.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written by Jason Wade, who {{originally}} finished the song {{in a hotel room}} after he visited a friend in Nashville who needed a kidney transplant. It was produced by John Fields and Scott Faircloff. In an interview with Alternative Addiction, Wade said, [...] "Broken is the song that moves me the most.

He had an anger in him that was unbelievable. The number of meals I've had thrown on the floor or in <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b> He'd pick up the tablecloth and just pull it off the table, and all the food would go flying. He had tantrums, a lot.

2500|$|Boyd's {{production}} garnered {{much attention}} at the time because of his interpolations and additions to the text. Most notably, Boyd introduced a new character into the trilogy. Called The Keeper, the character never speaks, but upon the death of each major character, the Keeper (played by Edward Clayton in 2000, and by Anthony Bunsee in 2006/2007), wearing all red, would walk onto stage and approach the body. The actor playing the body would then stand up and allow himself to be led off-stage by the figure. The production was also particularly noted for its realistic violence. According to Robert Gore-Langton of the Daily Express, in his review of the original 2000 production, [...] "blood from a severed arm sprayed over <b>my</b> <b>lap.</b> A human liver slopped to the floor by my feet. An eyeball scudded past, then a tongue." ...|$|E

It fell into the hopper, where they had a dozen or more translators and stenographers with nothing else to do. They picked up Trotsky's document, translated it and distributed it to the heads of the delegations {{and the members of the}} program commission. So, lo and behold, it was laid in <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> translated into English! Maurice Spector, a delegate from the Canadian Party, and in somewhat the same frame of mind as myself, was also on the program commission and he got a copy. We let the caucus meetings and the Congress sessions go to the devil while we read and studied this document. Then I knew what I had to do and so did he. Our doubts had been resolved... We made a compact there and then — Spector and I — that we would come back home and begin a struggle under the banner of Trotskyism." ...|$|E

Additionally, during Jack Cade's rebellion, the ghosts of Gloucester, Winchester and Suffolk all appear as rebels, and in a much lauded piece of double casting, Clayton and Bunsee also played Dick the Butcher in their respective performances.

It’s actually a pretty hard thing to do to keep going over 100 kilometres on country roads. Neither of my opponents had a car and they didn’t want to chase after me on one of those velocipedes. A journalist from our circle of friends suggested cycling in a velodrome which is actually just as tiring, especially for someone who is not used to it. But I agreed. A few days later, one morning at ten, I began <b>my</b> <b>laps</b> in the Vélodrome d’Hiver. An hour went by and then another.
