[...] Five other members were cleared of having violated rules, but were also required to repay their trips. [...] Rangel disagreed with the committee's finding, saying: Because they were <b>my</b> <b>staff</b> members who knew, one of whom has been discharged, [...] that I should have known.

General Eichelberger, MacArthur's Chief of Staff, wrote that [...] "In Washington I had read General MacArthur’s estimates of his two infantry divisions, and these reports and our own inspections had convinced <b>my</b> <b>staff</b> and me that the American troops were in no sense ready for jungle warfare."

Both on the stump and in Obama's political ad, [...] "Seven", the gaffe was used to portray McCain as somebody unable to relate to the concerns of ordinary Americans. This out-of-touch image was further cultivated when, on September 15, the day of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, at a morning rally in Jacksonville, Florida, McCain declared that [...] "the fundamentals of our economy are strong," [...] despite what he described as [...] "tremendous turmoil in our financial markets and Wall Street."

2500|$|At first, the Arras {{offensive}} {{went well}} with the Third Army breaking through the German lines and advancing three and half miles in one day. In {{a letter to his}} wife on 10 April 1917, Allenby wrote: [...] "I had a very big success yesterday. I won all along the line; killed a host of Boche and took over 7, 500 prisoners...We have, at last, brought off what I been working on all winter. <b>My</b> <b>staff</b> has been splendid". There were weeks of heavy fighting during 3rd Army's offensive at the Battle of Arras in the Spring of the 1917, where an initial breakthrough had deteriorated into trench-fighting positional warfare—once more with heavy casualties to 3rd Army's units involved. Allenby lost the confidence of his Commander-in-chief, Haig. He was promoted to full General on 3 June 1917, but he was replaced at the head of 3rd Army on 9 June 1917 and returned to England.|$|E
