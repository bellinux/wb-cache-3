40|$|General {{biochemistry}} detection on paper-based microanalytical devices (PADs) uses pipette titration. However, such {{an approach}} is extremely time-consuming for large-scale detection processes. Furthermore, while automated methods are available for increasing the efficiency of large-scale PAD production, the related equipment is very expensive. Accordingly, this study proposes a low-cost method for PAD <b>manufacture,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the reagent is applied using a modified inkjet printer. The optimal reaction times {{for the detection of}} aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are shown to be 6 and 7 min, respectively, given AST and ALT concentrations in the range of 5. 4 to 91. 2 U/L (R 2 = 0. 9932) and 5. 38 to 86. 1 U/L (R 2 = 0. 9944). The experimental results obtained using the proposed PADs for the concentration detection of AST and ALT in real human blood serum samples are found to be in good agreement with those obtained using a traditional spectrophotometric detection method by National Cheng Kung University hospital...|$|E

40|$|Propionibacterium freudenreichii {{is used as}} a {{ripening}} {{culture in}} Swiss cheese <b>manufacture,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it is involved in the formation of flavour and opening. The concentrations of flavour compounds produced by P. freudenreichii proved highly strain-dependant. Whether this phenotypic biodiversity is related to high molecular diversity is unknown. The aim of this work was to develop a Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme to study the molecular diversity and the population structure of P. freudenreichii. Internal fragments of seven genes – rpoB, adk, pf 1637, recA, pf 169, fumC, gtf – were amplified by PCR and sequenced for 113 strains from different origins. Allele types and sequence types (STs) were assigned according to MLST standards and phylogenetic analyses were performed. Forty-six distinct STs were resolved. Twenty-nine STs were unique (i. e. displayed by only one strain). The number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in allelic sequences ranged from 3 (gtf) to 15 (pf 1637). Most of the SNPs were synonymous. The sequences seemed to evolve by interlocus recombination rather than by intralocus recombination. No bond between STs and the strains origins was detected. Thirty-seven STs were assembled in one clonal complex (CC 1) with ST- 31 as ancestral founder. CC 1 represented the core of the population with 92 % of the strains. This work results {{in the design of the}} first MLST scheme for a Propionibacterium species. It is useful to study P. freudenreichii molecular diversity. The MLST results will next be related to the ability of strains to produce flavour compounds...|$|E

Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} find a new way to process it in order to get more useful result. One of efforts to process piece of coconut shells is making a piece of coconut shells process system to make charcoal from piece of coconut shells so be able to increase quality of it. Charcoal manufacture is the source of traditional biomassa energy in which it has more characteristics than natural firewood. Before making charcoal, it is necessary to hold a research and study books in which both try to prove whether the mean from kiln metal be able to make charcoal from piece of coconut shells. The purpose of research is to make modification carbonizing mean with kiln metal type based on the plan, in which the mean designed is the mean be able to produce 25 kg of charcoal from piece of coconut shells. Besides, it is also carefully examine probably modification of mean design to get higher charcoal rendemen and faster carbonization time with using three, six, and nine air entering holes. So, hopely on the research be able to get more quality fuel than pure substance not processed yet by kiln metal. We can determine value of burn from quality of used fuel. The fuel has good quality will produce the number of high heat, and also on the contrary. The farer object is kiln metal mean can be used to charcoal fuel production commercially in home industry and be able to made reference on later research about probably benefit of wood waste as source of energy non oil and natural gas...|$|E
40|$|Natural pozzolans {{are defined}} as either raw (volcanic material, limestone) or {{calcined}} natural materials (burnt shale, calcined kaolinite) with pozzolanic properties. Historically, {{they are among the}} oldest materials that have been used in combination with lime for construction purposes. For example, Santorin earth is a natural pozzolan from a volcanic eruption around 1500 BCE on an island of the same name in Greece. Over the last decades, research into cement matrices has been changing direction, owing to deeper environmental concerns over the impact of the cement industry and its consequences for climate change. Global environmental policies are increasingly strict, prioritizing the re-use rather than the disposal of industrial wastes. In this context, {{one of the biggest challenges}} is the search for strategies that promote the industrial rotation of high volumes of wastes in their productive cycles. The main purpose of this research is to widen the existing knowledge base on the behavior of new mineral pozzolans of high added value in the cement sector, lending special attention to paper sludge wastes generated in the process of paper <b>manufacture,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> recycled paper is used as a raw material. The results to date show that, once thermally activated (in the range of 650 – 700 °C), paper sludge turns out to be an alternative source of recycled metakaolin. This product is characterized by its high pozzolanic activity and improved performance with regard to the benefits of certain binary cements. The possibility of incorporating this industrial waste in cements along with other already standard pozzolans focuses, as mentioned, on the notable increase in the production of these types of cements. This is due, at present, to the extensive constructive applications for type-II cements (single additive) and to their lower economic and energetic costs that also makes them more suitable in times of economic crisis. In the present paper, the influence that pozzolan blends (activated paper sludge and fly ash) have on the reaction kinetics of ternary blended cements (6 and 21...|$|E
