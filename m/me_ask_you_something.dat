6000|$|... "But {{that was}} only for the moment. I could see nothing but her face--so sad, so wistful. But let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> Did you, the night after our walk on the drive in the moonlight--did you dream of me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{will tell}} you {{everything}} {{that has happened to}} me," [...] said Mr. Burke, [...] "and it won't take long; but first let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> Mrs. Cliff?" [...] and as he spoke he quietly rose and shut the parlor door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Courtledge," [...] he said, [...] "I {{think that}} you will allow <b>me</b> to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> without {{thinking}} <b>me</b> impertinent. You know that my wife and I have taken some interest in Prince Albert. It is on his account, is it not, that you look so gloomy to-night, as though you had an execution in front of you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{raised the}} girl by main force from her knees, {{and put her}} back in the chair. They both waited a little in silence. Keeping her hand on Louisa's shoulder, Magdalen seated herself again, and looked with unutterable {{bitterness}} of sorrow into the dying fire. [...] "Oh," [...] she thought, [...] "what happy women {{there are in the}} world! Wives who love their husbands! Mothers who are not ashamed to own their children! Are you quieter?" [...] she asked, gently addressing Louisa once more. [...] "Can you answer <b>me,</b> if I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> else? Where is the child?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question...: {{the first}} time you fucked her, was she any good? Yeah? Now let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> another question: how do you think she got that way? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Apart from this, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> else, Mr. Courage. Supposing {{the plot}} should succeed. How {{do you think}} it will be with us at the French Court? You know more about these things than we do. Shall we be {{accepted}} as the original holders of these titles would have been? Do you think that we shall have trouble with the French aristocrats?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{held out}} his hand to Uncle Ben. [...] "Let me congratulate you," [...] he said heartily, [...] "and forgive me if your story really sounded so {{wonderful}} I couldn't quite grasp it. Now let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> more. Have you had any reason for keeping this a secret, other than your fear of confessing that you violated a few bigoted and idiotic mining rules--which, after all, are binding only upon sentiment--and which your success has proved to be utterly impractical?" ...|$|E
40|$|Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> [...] . Why in Colombia, {{for five}} centuries, {{the cycle of}} {{violence}} has never been interrupted? Why injustice has seized the land and the neglect of these souls? Why Colombia, not Switzerland or Canada? And forgive me for these questions probably banal and unoriginal: it is that I am Italian and my country seems to suffer from the same disease. So let's see if a joint reflection and critical enough, we can propose some concrete answers to our existential concerns...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{wonder why}} I begged you to come. I wanted to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> <b>You</b> said I was ignorant. That is true. And what can I do but ask you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{have told}} <b>you</b> <b>something</b> very interesting," [...] she said, [...] "and in return I {{am going to}} <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> <b>You</b> quarrelled with her, did you not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Professor {{cleared his}} throat a couple of times, as though about to speak, and finally said, [...] "May I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lily,' I said, 'I would <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> After {{all that}} has been, will you still take me for your husband, unworthy as I am?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> the {{question}} <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> {{a few minutes}} ago," [...] her companion begged. [...] "Were you born in America--or England?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Highness," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, turning pale; [...] "let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to {{consider}} the importance of your life, not only to your friends, but to the public interest. 'If not to-night,' said this madman; but supposing that to-night some irreparable disaster were to overtake your Highness's person, what, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> what would be my despair, and what the concern and disaster of a great nation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I was richer, Miss Newson; {{and your}} {{stepfather}} {{had not been}} offended, I would <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> in a short time--yes, I would <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to-night. But that's not for me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Professor {{spoke up}} like a man," [...] she agreed, [...] "but, Laura, I want to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> Did <b>you</b> notice his servant--that man Craig?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} do that. I {{am going to}} <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> for your own good. You must leave off writing those letters to the English newspapers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Corporal, may I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something?</b> Do <b>you</b> {{plan to do}} {{this the}} rest of your life, sit out in the sun on a flat rock? Nothing else?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--everything! Well, well, well!" [...] But {{he pulled}} himself together; he began again to eat. [...] "I came back to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> That's what I came back for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Brave {{and generous}} friend, will <b>you</b> let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one last question? I am very ignorant, and it {{troubles}} me--just a little." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They're worth {{a bushel}} of diamonds--when you cook 'em. But let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something--is your old dad as fierce as Uncle Dan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Woodburn {{advanced}} {{and put her}} hand on her father's shoulder. [...] "Look heah, papa! Mr. Fulkerson wants to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> and he wants me to do it fo' him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Brother,' said Wegg, {{when this}} happy {{understanding}} was established, 'I {{should like to}} <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> <b>You</b> remember the night when I first looked in here, and found you floating your powerful mind in tea?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I don't think it's funny at all,' said Sam. 'But jes let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one thing: what's {{the name}} of the toll-gate woman?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very good,' pursued Mr Crummles, 'then we'll {{call that}} settled. Now, I want to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> else. There's a little--what shall I call it?--a little {{canvassing}} {{takes place on}} these occasions.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not yet; I wish to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> first. Arthur says he {{will come}} down {{as soon as he}} gets my reply. And--I should like Captain Horton to come with him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Plowman the State: Now, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question, ma'am. Do {{you have}} any {{religious}} beliefs or personal beliefs against the death penalty? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{when you}} come down to-morrow night, don't call out! Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a parting question. What made you cry, 'Halloa! Below there!' to-night?" ...|$|R
60|$|In conclusion, Sir, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> not {{to force}} on me this {{continued}} correspondence by daily attacks. It is a trouble and a nuisance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] he murmured. [...] "And now, having reached {{just this}} stage in our conversation, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> this. You read the newspapers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is beyond}} all measure charming of you," [...] Guillot declared, [...] "but let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a little question. Is it peace or war?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one," [...] {{chimed in}} the Girton Girl. [...] "Would a {{bricklayer}} hesitate any longer between a duchess and a scullery- maid?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see that}} I should {{come here with}} proofs," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Well, they are easy enough to collect. You shall have them. But before I go, Lord Arranmore, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> if you know who I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl nodded shortly. [...] "It's not my business," [...] she said. [...] "I am {{glad you}} came. I wanted to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> Who {{is this man}} Rowan who killed my uncle?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] said Mr. Skimpole, {{standing}} {{with his back to}} the fire after giving up the sketch when it was half finished, [...] "I should like to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> without offence." ...|$|R
