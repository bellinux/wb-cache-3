25|$|Claire {{lives with}} Agnes and Tobias {{and appears to}} have no means of support except for them. Her main role in life {{seems to be to}} annoy and embarrass her sister. She is {{everything}} that Agnes dislikes. Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias that he {{would be better off if}} he killed Agnes, Julia, and herself, that she will never know whether she wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> as if Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that she has never been able to reach. And instead of trying to reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a diametrically opposed manner.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of the drumming style implemented in recording the album is its adherence to human timing, as the tracks were mostly programmed mechanically during recording, therefore resulting in the album's intentional sloppiness. In a later interview, Questlove discussed the intention and purpose of including imperfection in the album's sound, stating [...] "we wanted to play as perfectly as we could, but then deliberately insert the little glitch that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> messed up. The idea was to sound disciplined, but with a total human feel." ...|$|E
500|$|Jason Scott of Blogcritics {{called it}} a [...] "gem" [...] and wrote that [...] "Lovato's pain runs so deep that this soul-baring song feels like a punch in the gut". Both Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu and Rick Florino of Artistdirect {{considered}} it a stand-out track of Unbroken, while [...] Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic ranked it at number 28 on his list of the best songs of 2011, writing, [...] "It's a moody waltz-time ballad whose cello-driven sense of atmosphere places it closer to something Coldplay might have done, although the phrasing <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like she's been getting into '60s soul, her vocal cracking just enough to say, 'I'm feeling this'." [...] Masley also considered it the second best song by Lovato, just behind [...] "Skyscraper".|$|E

500|$|The North Jersey Media Group {{gave the}} DVD 2.5starts out of five, saying that Madonna {{felt to be}} [...] "overly" [...] {{attached}} to her contemporary songs than her classic releases. They added [...] "that plodding through overlong arrangements of inconsequential songs— from the annoyingly vocoder-treated 'Revolver' early to the throwaway dance cut 'Celebration' at the end— will leave listeners wondering why so many substantial hits were given only a nod, if anything at all." [...] A review by Kevin Taft in online website [...] "Edge on the Net" [...] was overall negative. Taft noticed that Madonna's vocals were altered and mixed {{so much that it}} sounded disembodied and did not match the singer's lips. He was [...] "shocked" [...] to find that the audio CDs also contained the badly mixed songs. The reviewer explained that [...] "The choice to have the backing track turned down so low doesn't help much either. In fact, it <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> as if Madonna is on a cabaret stage with a five-piece band... For the six months it took Madge to edit her concert, one would wish she got her vocals to match her lips." [...] However, Taft commended the overall show and the technical brilliance accompanying it.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on {{the rock}} album {{tried to focus on}} [...] "general themes that {{everyone}} can get their hands on", while the acoustic had introspective lyrics that are [...] "vulnerable and revealing", with things Grohl [...] "wouldn't say out loud, wouldn't even admit to myself." [...] Grohl declared that [...] "when you're writing songs that have a sort of anthemic quality, you can't really go lighthearted and sing about bullshit. You have to dig into a deeper place to find the words", and that [...] "I don't know what it is about, this album, that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> more heartfelt or deeper or more emotional, but when I listen to it, it really is." [...] These include [...] "Friend of a Friend", a song which Grohl wrote in the 1990s about himself and his former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain during the time they shared an apartment together in 1990, and [...] "Still", talking about a suicide Grohl saw when he was ten in Virginia, by a boy who jumped on the train tracks. Much of the album's theme and content, including the title, came after Grohl spent time on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. [...] "We'd pull in to small towns, and thousands of people would come to be rescued by this man", said Grohl. [...] "It's not a political record, but what I saw inspired me." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Karofsky's newly revealed sexual orientation, {{other aspects of}} his personality have been explored. In [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", when the football team is forced {{to spend a week}} working with the glee club that Karofsky and other members have been bullying, the [...] "softer side" [...] of his personality is seen, especially when he's performing with the club. After the club's director surprises him with a compliment on his performing, Karofsky is the one who suggests that the team perform an extra musical number for the halftime show they are preparing for, though he comes up with a rationale that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like a necessity to keep up their social status rather than something he particularly wants to do. Adler said, [...] "I feel like that it did make him happy and, obviously, he has some natural abilities that Mr. Schuester was able to spot. I don't think he's ever allowed himself to do that ever in his life, to dance or learn a song, especially to do that in public. ...Doing that was such an obstacle to overcome." [...] In [...] "Furt" [...] and [...] "Born This Way", it is revealed that he had been kind, a cub scout, and an [...] "A" [...] student. However, his behavior had changed for the worse in the former episode before returning to the good in the latter. Although the anti-bullying club formed by Karofsky and Santana in [...] "Born This Way" [...] is created with ulterior motives in mind, Karofsky subsequently makes a tearful apology to Kurt in [...] "Prom Queen", and then insists that Kurt wait for his safety escort after the next class period.|$|E

2500|$|Later in January 2006, Senator Norm Coleman's {{chief of}} staff, Erich Mische, {{verified}} that Coleman's staffers had edited his page [...] "to correct inaccuracies and delete information." [...] Mische stated: [...] "What's to stop someone from writing in that Norm Coleman was 7 feet 10 inches, with green hair and one eye smack dab {{in the middle}} of his head? That's about as silly as this gets ... When you put 'edia' in there, it <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> as if this is a benign, objective piece of information." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Baby's in Black" [...] is {{performed}} at a 6/8 time signature with a moderate tempo that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like 3/4 (waltz-time). AMG described the song as [...] "a love lament for a grieving girl that was perhaps more morose {{than any previous}} Beatles' song." [...] Musicologist Alan W. Pollack notes that the song is relatively complex in format, with a refrain, bridge, and a guitar solo. He describes the song as having [...] "mishmash" [...] of stylistic elements—among them, [...] "bluesy" [...] chords and country music-inspired vocals.|$|E
2500|$|The show {{features}} a laugh track, something Ullman was hesitant about using. [...] "That's a very BBC thing to do. I hate {{things like that}} on a show. But when we played it, it kind of worked. It <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like you're connecting with people. Comedy has gotten a bit cold lately, and neurotic and depressed. This is a nice BBC One family show. It's not too arch or bleak." [...] All laughter is genuine and was captured via live screenings before a studio audience at BBC Radio Theatre.|$|E

2500|$|Era Extraña is {{significantly}} influenced by psychedelic pop, shoegaze and new wave. Clash reviewer Nick Levine described the album as a loud indietronica record and [...] "chillwave that's not actually that, well, chilled", joking that the album's genre should be marked as [...] "drillwave". Its instrumentation is cluttered with unsteady synth arrangements, {{as well as}} stray sounds of rocket-ship noises, phone conversations, laser sounds and visceral samples of video games, but the music still manages to be tight. As Drowned in Sound reviewer Robert Cooke explained, the retro video game samples were used as [...] "incidental noise, or miniature musical experiments", and the record also included the [...] "sparkling synths and wide-eyed wonder" [...] of M83's more pop-sounding material that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like [...] "a soundtrack for an Eighties teen movie about surfers from space" [...] rather than just [...] "Nintendo-sponsored masturbation". Spin reviewer Nick Murray also compared some of the songs to M83, describing other tracks as [...] "one Martin Rushent assist away from being genuine synth-pop hits".|$|E

At the age of 15, she is seemingly killed by Elfman in his berserk full-body takeover form. However, Lisanna is actually transported to Edolas and becomes incognito as a member of Edolas's version of Fairy Tail after being mistaken for her own deceased counterpart. Two years later, she is forced to return to Earth-land when Mystogan reverses Anima's effects, and reunites with her own siblings. She goes on {{to take part in the}} S-Class qualification trial as Juvia Lockser's partner. Lisanna worked as a waitress when the guild disbanded before it reformed.

2500|$|In a mixed review, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani {{wrote that}} [...] "Kelly's songwriting skills leave {{much to be}} desired; for every hook-driven 'You Knock Me Out' there's a 'Showdown,' an asinine, interlude-filled insult to songwriters everywhere". Q wrote that [...] "as ever, [...] songs veer between the nigglingly {{infectious}} and cliched slush." [...] Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot viewed that [...] "the subtext for this one <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like musical spin control, a public-relations manifesto {{as much as an}} R album. [...] There are a few moments when the disconnect between Kelly's lyrics and his sordid legal troubles becomes disturbing, no more so than when he refers to himself as the 'pied piper of R' in 'Step in the Name of Love,' a reference to the fairy-tale figure who enticed a village full of children away from their parents". Dan Leroy of Yahoo! Music's felt that [...] "Kelly’s hot-blooded horniness {{is an integral part of}} his persona; he can hardly back away from the risque R that’s made him what he is, despite the underage sex scandal that dogs him". On Kelly's performance, Leroy concluded by writing: ...|$|E

Look here; I'll tell you if you like, but I'm afraid it involves an introduction. You've got to understand one of the tricks of the modern mind, a tendency that most people obey without noticing it. In the village or suburb outside there's an inn with the sign of St. George and the Dragon. Now suppose I went about telling everybody that this was only a corruption of King George and the Dragoon. Scores of people would believe it, without any inquiry, from a vague feeling that it's probable because it's prosaic. It turns something romantic and legendary into something recent and ordinary. And that somehow <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> rational, though it is unsupported by reason. Of course some people would have the sense to remember having seen St. George in old Italian pictures and French romances, but a good many wouldn't think about it at all. They would just swallow the skepticism because it was skepticism. Modern intelligence won't accept anything on authority. But it will accept anything without authority. That's exactly what has happened here.|$|E
