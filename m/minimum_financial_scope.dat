Secondly, we measure the absolute and relative household poverty impact of instituting a universal income grant, set at different monthly values. Finally, a brief costing exercise of such a grant is undertaken. The <b>minimum</b> <b>financial</b> contribution simulations are very useful insights into the scale and nature of the poverty challenge in South Africa. The universal income grant numbers testify to the importance of balancing the undoubted need for poverty alleviation as against the pressure on the fiscus. Such interventions are likely to induce.

40|$|The German Federal States {{have little}} impact on their budget. Both, {{revenues}} and ex-penditures, are basically determined by federal and European law. For a long time, this situation has been causing increasing debts. Today, public debts are again a top issue. The planned federal “debt brake” includes a gradual reduction and an interdiction of structural debts as from 2020. In a short perspective, this means an additional financial limitation to the public budgets. With regard to the described situation, the main question of this paper is: Do the German states actually have <b>financial</b> <b>scope</b> to realize {{the implementation of the}} planned “debt brake”? The analyses show that the <b>financial</b> <b>scope</b> for reducing their structural debts is particularly small in the five Federal States benefitting from additional transfers as from 2010.

30|$|However, {{the premise}} of a low {{willingness}} to pay was not only based on a lack of social pressure. With the final abolishment of funeral allowances in 2004, consumers had to pay {{the full cost of}} funerals. Accordingly, the funeral homes expected a further decline in willingness to pay because “if someone else pays, you don’t look at the money” (Expert 13), but consumers supposedly did once the financial aid disappeared.

Along with the path-dependent dynamics described above, this development indicates that the organizations had entirely forfeited their scope of action and did not perceive any strategic alternatives (Koch 2008, 2011).|$|R
