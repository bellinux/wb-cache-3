Two yeast lysis methods (<b>mechanical</b> <b>lysis</b> and sonication) were tested and optimized to produce a riboflavin-rich yeast lysate. The reactors were operated at 25 ºC for 48 hours, evaluating the effect of external carbon source (glucose) and RM (from residual yeast lysate and commercial yeast extract) addition. The results showed that color removal efficiencies for the batch reactors fed with commercial yeast extract reached 90 %, whereas those fed with discharged yeast lysate reached 80 % (sonication) and 73 % (<b>mechanical</b> <b>lysis).</b> These values were statistically higher when compared to reactors operating without RM (48 to 66 %), demonstrating that yeast extract enhances azo dye degradation in anaerobic conditions and that the residual yeast is a cheap and alternative source of carbon and of the RM riboflavin...|$|E
40|$|The {{release of}} 32 P-labeled {{bacterial}} phospholipid from a smooth Escherichia coli by serum components depends on complement activated by antibody. Phospholipid release in excess antibody {{tends to be}} proportional to the concentration of complement as does the release of other cellular constituents. Phospholipids are not simply stripped off during cell lysis. Whereas 94 % of the total phospholipid freed from E. coli by <b>mechanical</b> <b>lysis</b> sediments at centrifugal forces sufficient to sediment molecules of 106 molecular weight, similar centrifugation sediments only 50 % of the phospholipid released by antibody-complement. In fact, after <b>mechanical</b> <b>lysis</b> more than 50 % of the phospholipid sediments at velocities sufficient to bring down cell envelopes. Although {{the bulk of the}} bacterial phospholipid is located in the cell envelopes, isolated 32 P-labeled cell envelopes and phenol-extracted lipopolysaccharide fails to release phospholipids in the presence of antibody-complement. Moreover, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, which like antibody-complement causes loss of cellular selective permeability and prepares E. coli cell walls for the action of lysozyme, releases only small amounts of phospholipid from E. coli and these are sedimentable. The most likely mechanism of phospholipid release caused by antibody-complement appears to be the activation directly or indirectly of an enzyme which is present only in the intact cells...|$|E

Although these approaches are superior to traditional culture-based methods, they introduce bias at the experimental and bioinformatics levels. We assessed {{the diversity of the}} human salivary microbiome by pyrosequencing of the 16 S rDNA V 1 - 3 amplicons using metagenomic DNA extracted by two different protocols: a simple proteinase K digestion without a subsequent DNA clean-up step, and a bead-beating <b>mechanical</b> <b>lysis</b> protocol followed by column DNA purification. A high degree of congruence was found between the two extraction methods, most notably in regard to the microbial community composition. The results showed that for a given bioinformatics pipeline, all the taxa with an average proportion > 0. 12 % in samples processed using one extraction method were also detected in samples extracted using the other method. The same taxa tended to be abundant and frequent for both extraction methods. The relative abundance of sequence reads assigned to the phyla Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, TM 7, Synergistetes, and Tenericutes was significantly higher in the mechanically-treated samples than in the enzymatically-treated samples, whereas the phylum Firmicutes showed the opposite pattern.

After <b>mechanical</b> cell <b>lysis,</b> ribosomes are separated by centrifugation steps, avoiding massive humic acid contamination and RNA degradation. The protocol accommodates the complex composition of soils by blocking adsorbing surfaces and humic acids with polyvinylpyrrolidone and bovine serum albumin. A usual RNA extraction step yields rRNA accessible for hybridization or reverse transcription-PCR. Hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes was used for group-specific yield comparison. By using a probe hybridizing to the 16 S rRNA of the bacterial kingdom, total bacterial rRNA yield {{was estimated to be}} in the range of 0. 2 microgram per g for different soils. Group-specific probes did not indicate a selectivity of the isolation procedure and differentiated the compositions of different soil microbial communities. The sequence diversity of the isolated RNA population was also revealed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of reverse transcription-PCR amplification products by using a region of the 16 S rRNA as a target. The pattern obtained by this analysis differed from a similar one resulting from the separation of amplification products of community DNA preparations. This different view of the community composition is attributable to the correlation of ribosome numbers to the metabolic activity of bacteria in the habitat under observation...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of cell handling and storage on cell integrity and (1) H high resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) NMR spectra. Three different cell types have been considered (lung tumoral, amniocytes, and MG- 63 osteosarcoma cells) in order for sample-dependent effects to be identified. Cell integrity of fresh cells and cells frozen in cryopreservative solution was approximately 70 - 80 %, with the former showing higher membrane degradation, probably enzymatic, as indicated by increased phosphocholine (PC) and/or glycerophosphocholine (GPC). Unprotected freezing (either gradual or snap-freezing) was found to lyse cells completely, similar to <b>mechanical</b> cell <b>lysis.</b> Besides enhanced metabolites visibility, lysed cells showed a different lipid profile compared to intact cells, with increased choline, PC, and GPC and decreased phosphatidylcholine (PTC). Cell lysis has, therefore, a significant effect on cell lipid composition, making handling reproducibility an important issue in lipid analysis. Sample spinning was found to disrupt 5 - 25 % of cells, depending on cell type, and HRMAS was shown to be preferable to solution-state NMR of suspensions or supernatant, giving enhanced information on lipids and comparable resolution for smaller metabolites. Relaxation- and diffusion-edited NMR experiments gave limited information on intact cells, compared to lysed cells. The (1) H HRMAS spectra of the three cell types are compared and discussed...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{characterization}} of a novel platform for <b>mechanical</b> cell <b>lysis</b> {{of even the most}} difficult to lyse cell types on a micro or nanoscale (maximum 70 μL total volume). The system incorporates a machined plastic circular disk assembly, magnetic field actuated microfluidics, centrifugal cells and tissue homogenizer and centrifugation system. The mechanism of tissue disruption of this novel cell homogenization apparatus derives from the relative motion of ferromagnetic metal disks and grinding matrices in a liquid medium within individual chambers of the disk in the presence of an oscillating magnetic field. The oscillation of the ferromagnetic disks or blades produces mechanical impaction and shear forces capable of disrupting cells within the chamber both by direct action of the blade and by the motion of the surrounding lysis matrix, and by motion induced vortexing of buffer fluid. Glass beads or other grinding media are integrated into each lysis chamber within the disk to enhance the transfer of energy from the oscillating metal blade to the cells. The system also achieves the centrifugal elimination of solids from each liquid sample and allows the elution of clarified supernatants via siphoning into a collection chamber fabricated into the plastic disk assembly.

In contrast, {{little is known about}} the direct effect of heparins on the nanostructure of fibrin fibers, even though this nanostructure plays a major role in the <b>mechanical</b> strength and <b>lysis</b> of clots. This lack of reliable data can be correlated with the lack of a nonintrusive, quantitative method to determine this structure. We recently developed such a method that allows the simultaneous determination of the average fiber radius and the protein content using spectrometric data. In this study, we assessed the nanostructure of fibrin in a system composed of human thrombin and fibrinogen. METHODS AND RESULTS: We provide quantitative evidence showing that both unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin directly alter the nanostructure of fibrin fibers independent of their other actions on the coagulation cascade; as expected, the pentasaccharide fondaparinux has no effect.

40|$|Many {{protocols}} {{to extract}} DNA directly from soil samples {{have been developed}} in recent years. We employed two extraction methods which differed in the method of lysis and compared these methods with respect to yield, purity and degree of shearing. The main focus was on the specific isolation of DNA from different microorganisms, especially DNA from actinomycetes, as these cells {{are very difficult to}} lyse in contrast to non-actinomycetes. Thus, we used both methods to isolate DNA from Pseudomonas (Entcheva et al. 2001), Arthrobacter and Rhodococcus (Borneman et al. 1996) and from soil spiked with the respective microorganisms. Both methods rendered high DNA yields with a low degree of shearing but differed in the type of cells that were lysed.

Streptomyces scabiei, S. acidiscabies, S. avermitilis, S. coelicolor and S. melanosporofaciens were grown both in the presence and absence of suberin. In all species tested, the presence of the plant polymer induced the production of aerial hyphae and enhanced resistance to <b>mechanical</b> <b>lysis.</b> The presence of suberin in liquid minimal medium also induced the synthesis of typical secondary metabolites in S. scabiei and S. acidiscabies (thaxtomin A), S. coelicolor (actinorhodin) and S. melanosporofaciens (geldanamycin). In S. scabiei, the presence of suberin modified the fatty acid composition of the bacterial membrane, which translated into higher membrane fluidity. Moreover, suberin also induced thickening of the bacterial cell wall. The present data indicate that suberin hastens cellular differentiation and triggers the onset of secondary metabolism in the genus Streptomyces...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the influence of three soil DNA extraction procedures, namely the International Organization for Standardization (ISO- 11063, GnS-GII and modified ISO procedure (ISOm), on the taxonomic diversity and composition of soil bacterial and fungal communities. The efficacy of each soil DNA extraction method was assessed on five soils, differing in their physico-chemical characteristics and land use. A meta-barcoded pyrosequencing approach targeting 16 S and 18 S rRNA genes was applied to characterize soil microbial communities. We first observed that the GnS-GII introduced some heterogeneity in bacterial composition between replicates. Then, although no major difference was observed between extraction procedures for soil bacterial diversity, we saw that the number of fungal genera could be underestimated by the ISO- 11063. In particular, this procedure underestimated the detection in several soils of the genera Cryptococcus, Pseudallescheria, Hypocrea and Plectosphaerella, which are of ecological interest. Based on these results, we recommend using the ISOm method for studies focusing on both the bacterial and fungal communities. Indeed, the ISOm procedure provides a better evaluation of bacterial and fungal communities and is limited to the modification of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>lysis</b> step of the existing ISO- 11063 standard...|$|E
40|$|This project {{concentrated}} {{on the use of}} the commercially available Phaffia rhodozyma NCYC 874 as an astaxanthin source. The purpose of this research was to investigate the optimum conditions for a batch fermentation of the yeast. Cell growth and astaxanthin production by the yeast using two different media was investigated, as previous work has highlighted major differences in the growth and efficiency of astaxanthin production in various media. This research was also concerned with the effect of carbon concentration on pigment levels. Consumption of the nitrogen source by the yeast was also investigated with regard to biomass and pigment production. The parent strain (NCYC 874) of Phaffia rhodozyma and a mutant strain of the yeast (NRRL-Y- 18734), were both cultivated in a laboratory scale 2 litre fermenter to compare biomass and astaxanthin yields and the utilisation of the carbon and nitrogen sources. Three different approaches were used to extract astaxanthin from the yeast cells, <b>mechanical</b> breakage, acid <b>lysis</b> and enzyme treatment. Phaffia rhodozyma NCYC 874 produced a higher yield of astaxanthin in the Mineral Salts medium than in the Yeast Malt Broth, which is the commercial medium used for culturing the yeast. Higher astaxanthin yields were obtained using a 1...|$|R
40|$|Decrease in {{microbial}} {{contacts in}} affluent societies {{is considered to}} lie behind the rise in allergic and other chronic inflammatory diseases during the last decades. Indeed, deviations in the intestinal microbiota composition and diversity {{have been associated with}} several diseases, such as atopic eczema. However, there is no consensus yet on what would constitute a beneficial or harmful microbiota. The aim of this thesis was to study the microbiota development in healthy infants and to characterize intestinal microbiota signatures associated with disease status and severity in infants with atopic eczema. The methodological aim was to compare and optimize methods for DNA extraction from fecal samples to be used in high-throughput microbiota analyses. It was confirmed that the most critical step in successful microbial DNA extraction from fecal samples is the <b>mechanical</b> cell <b>lysis</b> procedure. Based on this finding, an efficient semi-automated extraction process was developed that can be scaled for use in high-throughput platforms such as phylogenetic microarray used in this series of studies. By analyzing a longitudinal motherchild cohort for 3 years it was observed that the microbiota development is a gradual process, where some bacterial groups reach the degree of adult-type pattern earlier than others. During the breast-feeding period, the microbiota appeared to be relatively simple, while major diversification was found to start during the weaning process. By the age of 3 years, the child’s microbiota composition started to resemble that of an adult, but the bacterial diversity has still not reached the full diversity, indicating that the microbiota maturation extends beyond this age. In addition, at three years of age, the child’s microbiota was more similar to mother’s microbiota than to microbiota of nonrelated women. In infants with atopic eczema, a high total microbiota diversity and abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria was found to correlate with mild symptoms at 6 months. At 18 months, infants with mild eczema had significantly higher microbiota diversity and aberrant microbiota composition when compared to healthy controls at the same age. In conclusion, the comprehensive phylogenetic microarray analysis of early life microbiota shows the synergetic effect of vertical transmission and shared environment on the intestinal microbiota development. By the age of three years, the compositional development of intestinal microbiota is close to adult level, but the microbiota diversification continues beyond this age. In addition, specific microbiota signatures are associated with the existence and severity of atopic eczema and intestinal microbiota seems to have a role in alleviating the symptoms of this disease...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—Determinants of {{successful}} recanalization likely differ for Merci thrombectomy and intra-arterial pharmacological fibrinolysis interventions. Although {{the amount of}} thrombotic material to be digested is an important consideration for chemical <b>lysis,</b> <b>mechanical</b> debulking may be more greatly influenced by other target lesion characteristics. Methods—In consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with Merci thrombectomy for middle cerebral artery M 1 occlusions, we analyzed the influence on recanalization success and clinical outcome of target thrombus size (length) and shape (curvature and branching) on pretreatment T 2 * gradient echo MRI. Results—Among 65 patients, pretreatment MRI showed susceptibility vessel signs in 45 (69 %). Thrombus length averaged 13. 03 mm (range, 5. 56 – 34. 91) and irregular shape (curvature or branching) was present in 17 of 45 (38 %). Presence and length of susceptibility vessel signs did not predict recanalization or good clinical outcome. Substantial recanalization (Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction 2 b or 3) and good clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 2) were more frequent with regular than irregular susceptibility vessel signs shape (57 % versus 18 %, P 0. 013; 39 % versus 6 %, P 0. 017). On multiple regression analysis, the only independent predictor of substantial recanalization was irregular susceptibility vessel signs (OR, 0. 16; 95 % CI, 0. 04 – 0. 69; P 0. 014); and leading predictors of good clinical outcome were baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (OR, 1. 20; 95 % CI, 1. 03 – 1. 40; P 0. 019) and irregular susceptibility vessel signs (OR, 9. 36; 95 % CI, 0. 98 – 89. 4; P 0. 052). Conclusions—Extension of thrombus into middle cerebral artery division branches and curving shape of the middle cerebral artery stem, but not thrombus length, decrease technical and clinical success of Merci thrombectomy in M 1 occlusions...|$|R
