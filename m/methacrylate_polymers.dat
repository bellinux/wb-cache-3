The polymer structures have been characterized using NMR spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography, and their thermal properties determined using differential scanning calorimetry. The polymers have been evaluated for their performance as electron-beam resists, both lithographically {{and in terms of}} their erosion rates in oxygen plasma processing; for these purposes, the performance of poly(methyl methacrylate) was used as a reference. Positive-working behaviour was observed for all the polymers with non-silylated ester functions, the lithographic sensitivities varying in the order butyl > ethyl > methyl approximately propyl > phenyl >> benzyl, and oxygen plasma etch rates being of the order of 2000 angstrom min- 1. With the possible exception of poly(trimethylsilylmethyl methacrylate), the incorporation of trimethylsilyl groups in the alkyl ester functions is found to reduce significantly the lithographic sensitivities of the resists, and for the trimethylsilyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl polymers, a dominant negative-working behaviour pattern is revealed through judicious choice of developing solvents. In contrast, positive-working behaviour is maintained for the trimethylsilylaryl <b>methacrylate</b> <b>polymers.</b> The sensitivities of these are greater than those of the parent non-silylated polyesters, markedly so {{in the case of the}} benzyl polymer.

30|$|Viscosity index (VI) {{improvers}} {{are long}} chain, high-molecular weight polymers that function by causing the relative viscosity {{of an oil}} to increase more at high temperatures than at low temperatures.
