40|$|The {{introduction}} of {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation (HSCT) has significantly improved the life-span of Hurler patients (<b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>I-H,</b> MPS I-H). Yet, the musculoskeletal manifestations seem largely unresponsive to HSCT. In order to facilitate evidence based management, {{the aim of the}} current study was to give a systematic overview of the orthopaedic complications and motor functioning of Hurler's patients after HSCT. A systematic review was conducted of the medical literature published from January 1981 to June 2010. Two reviewers independently assessed all eligible citations, as identified from the Pubmed and Embase databases. A pre-developed data extraction form was used to systematically collect information on the prevalence of radiological and clinical signs, and on the orthopaedic treatments and outcomes. A total of 32 studies, including 399 patient reports were identified. The most frequent musculoskeletal abnormalities were odontoid hypoplasia (72 %), thoracolumbar kyphosis (81 %), genu valgum (70 %), hip dysplasia (90 %) and carpal tunnel syndrome (63 %), which were often treated surgically during the first decade of life. The overall complication rate of surgical interventions was 13. 5 %. Motor functioning was further hampered due to reduced joint mobility, hand dexterity, motor development and longitudinal growth. Stem cell transplantation does not halt the progression of a large range of disabling musculoskeletal abnormalities in Hurler's disease. Although prospective data on the quantification, progression and treatment of these deformities were very limited, early surgical intervention is often advocated. Prospective data collection will be mandatory to achieve better evidence on the effect of treatment strategies...|$|E
40|$|Hurler's {{syndrome}} SUMMARY The {{occurrence of}} the Hurler syn-drome and acute myelogenous leukaemia in a 2 year-old girl is described. This represents the first published report of the concurrence of these two diseases. In this report we describe a patient with mucopoly-saccharidosis type I (Hurler's syndrome) (Bach et al., 1972; Stevenson et al., 1976), in whom acute myelogenous leukaemia developed. The {{occurrence of the}}se two rare diseases in the same person has not been previously documented. Case report A 6 -month-old white girl was referred to the Univer-sity of Minnesota Health Sciences Center in Septem-ber 1974 because of a heart murmur. Past medical history showed that the mother's pregnancy and delivery and the patient's newborn period were uncomplicated. At 1 month of age the child was treated for otitis media and at 3 months of age had an episode of severe diarrhoea which required admission to hospital. At 5 months, she developed persistent oral thrush and a urinary tract infection which was suc-cessfully treated with antibiotics. The patient's heart murmur {{was thought to be}} caused by a small ventri-cular septal defect which did not require immediate intervention. At the age of 11 months, the patient was admitted to the University of Minnesota Hospitals in acute renal failure caused by persistent diarrhoea and dehy-dration. Physical examination showed facial dys-morphia resembling that of the Hurler syndrome, an umbilical hernia, and hepatomegaly. Radiological examination disclosed the bony changes character-istic of dysostosis multiplex. Blood counts, including a leucocyte differential count, were normal. Exa-mination of blood smears showed cytoplasmic inclusions in approximately 20 % of the lymphocytes. These inclusions were usually coarse, sharply delineated, and surrounded by small clear haloes. They stained darkly with Wright's-Giemsa stain and were metachromatic when stained with toluidine blue. Urinary total acid mucopolysaccharide was 10. 6 mg/ 24 hr (normal: 0 - 6 mg/ 24 hr). Urinary excretion of dermatan sulphate was 6. 6 mg/ 24 hr (normal: 0 to 1. 0 mg/ 24 hr) and excretion of heparan sulphate was 1. 5 mg/ 24 hr (normal: 0 to 1. 5 mg/ 24 hr).

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder caused by deficiency of α-L-iduronidase and {{characterized by a}} progressive course with multisystem involvement. Clinically, <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I is classified into two forms: severe (Hurler syndrome), which presents in infancy and is characterized by rapid progressive neurological involvement and attenuated (Hurler/Scheie and Scheie syndromes), which presents with slower progression and absent to mild nervous system involvement. The specific treatment for attenuated <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I consists of enzyme-replacement therapy with laronidase (human recombinant α-L-iduronidase, Aldurazyme). We present here the clinical and laboratory results in an 12 -year-old patient affected by the attenuated form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I treated by enzyme-replacement therapy {{from the age of}} 5 months, compared with his 17 year old affected sister, who started therapy at 5 years of age. CASE PRESENTATION: Clinical evaluation of these siblings shows that initiation of therapy prior of the onset of clinically detectable disease resulted in considerable improvement in outcome in the young sibling. After 12 years of enzyme-replacement therapy, facial appearance, linear growth rate, and liver and spleen volumes were normal; moreover, the degree of joint disease, vertebral, and cardiac valvular involvement were only minimal compared with those of his sister. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that early diagnosis and early initiation of enzyme-replacement therapy substantially modify the natural history of the attenuated form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I...|$|R

40|$|<b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>Type</b> I is a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{with varying}} degrees of phenotypic severity caused by mutations in IDUA. Over 200 disease-causing variants in IDUA have been reported. We describe the profile of disease-causing variants in 291 individuals with <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>Type</b> I for whom IDUA sequencing was performed, focussing on the UK subset of the cohort. A total of 63 variants were identified, of which 20 were novel, and the functional significance of the novel variants is explored. The severe form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>Type</b> I is treated with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, known to have improved outcomes with earlier age at treatment. Developing genotype-phenotype relationships would therefore have considerable clinical utility, especially {{in the light of the}} development of newborn screening programs for <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>Type</b> I. Associations between genotype and phenotype are examined in this cohort, particularly in the context of the profile of variants identified in UK individuals.

40|$|Cardiovascular disease, a {{progressive}} manifestation of α-L-iduronidase deficiency or <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I, continues in patients both untreated and treated with {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation or intravenous enzyme replacement. Few {{studies have examined the}} effects of α-L-iduronidase deficiency and subsequent glycosaminoglycan storage upon arterial gene expression to understand the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Gene expression in carotid artery, ascending, and descending aortas from four non-tolerized, non-enzyme treated 19 month-old <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I dogs was compared with expression in corresponding vascular segments from three normal, age-matched dogs. Data were analyzed using R and whole genome network correlation analysis, a bias-free method of categorizing expression level and significance into discrete modules. Genes were further categorized based on module-trait relationships. Expression of clusterin, a protein implicated in other etiologies of cardiovascular disease, was assessed in canine and murine <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I aortas via Western blot and in situ immunohistochemistry. Gene families with more than two-fold, significant increased expression involved lysosomal function, proteasome function, and immune regulation. Significantly downregulated genes were related to cellular adhesion, cytoskeletal elements, and calcium regulation. Clusterin gene overexpression (9 -fold) and protein overexpression (1. 3 to 1. 62 -fold) was confirmed and located specifically in arterial plaques of mucopolysaccharidosis-affected dogs and mice. Overexpression of lysosomal and proteasomal-related genes are expected responses to cellular stress induced by lysosomal storage in <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I.

40|$|<b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> IIIA is a {{neurodegenerative}} lysosomal storage disorder {{characterized by}} progressive loss of learned skills, sleep disturbance and behavioural problems. Absent or greatly reduced activity of sulphamidase, a lysosomal protein, results in intracellular accumulation of heparan sulphate. Subsequent neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration typify this and many other lysosomal storage disorders. We propose that intra-cerebrospinal fluid protein delivery represents a potential therapeutic avenue for treatment of this and other neurodegenerative conditions; however, technical restraints restrict examination of its use prior to adulthood in mice. We have used a naturally-occurring <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> IIIA mouse model to determine the effectiveness of combining intravenous protein replacement (1 mg/kg) from birth to 6 weeks of age with intra-cerebrospinal fluid sulphamidase delivery (100 μg, fortnightly from 6 weeks) on behaviour, the level of heparan sulphate-oligosaccharide storage and other neuropathology. Mice receiving combination treatment exhibited similar clinical improvement and reduction in heparan sulphate storage to those only receiving intra-cerebrospinal fluid enzyme. Reductions in micro- and astrogliosis and delayed development of ubiquitin-positive lesions were seen in both groups. A third group of intravenous-only treated mice did not exhibit clinical or neuropathological improvements.
