40|$|For {{the first}} time, the {{interaction}} of chlorides of the three-valent phosphorus with threehydrates of niobo- and tantalocene has been studied. It has been shown, that this interaction flows by two mechanisms: of introduction and radical. The conception of isomery dihydridephosphid-hydridphosphine <b>metalocene</b> has been formulated, the factors, determining the formation of these isomers, have been revealed. Developed have been the convenient methods of synthesis of the chlorphosphine, hydridphosphine, diphosphide and diohosphine derivatives of the niobocene and isomeric derivatives of the tantalocene derivatives. The first niobiumrhodium bimetallic complex has been synthesized, its catalytic activity in {{the reaction of the}} hydrosililating of olefines has been studiedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} radical bulk {{polymerization}} of styrene. Recent knowledges about mono- and multifunctional initiators of radical polymerization and coordination polymerization of styrene with <b>metalocene</b> initiators {{are summarized in}} theoretical part. Experimental part of diploma thesis is focused on relationship between polymerization conditions and conversion, molecular mass and distribution of molecular mass. Experiments carried out with monofunctional initiators (dibenzoylperoxide, dilauroylperoxide, tert-butylperbenzoate) and with bifunctional initiators (Luperox 101 and Luperox 256). Polymerizations took place at temperatures from 80 to 134 °C, reaction time was from 1 to 24 hours, and pressure was 100 and 500 kPa. Conversion of monomer was determined by gravimetry and infrared spectroscopy. Molecular mass and indexes of polydisperzity were measured by gel permeation chromatography in solutions of polystyrene with tetrahydrofurane at temperature 23 °C...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Metal catalyzed polymerizations are chain {{reactions}} necessitating {{a constant}} valence of the metal. In contrast to that metal catalyzed polycondensations are step growth reactions involving {{a change of}} the valence of the metal. Tuning of the reaction by structural variations of the metal catalyst are demonstrated with the Pd-catalyzed vinyl polymerization of norbornene, the alternating copolymerization of ethylene with carbon monoxide and the Heck reaction as examples. One and two electron processes can be involved in metal catalyzed polycondensations. The oxidative polymerization of 2, 6 -dimethylphenol, the Heck reactions as well the Ni-catalyzed synthesis of polyphenylenes are discussed. m-Metal catalyzed reactions are of indispensable importance in the value adding chain of chemical technology. In the area of macromolecular chemistry metal catalyzed polymerizations are of basic importance to produce commodity polymers. The elaboration of <b>metalocene</b> catalysts is causing a strong push in the development (1). Metal catalysis is also of importance in the synthesis of monomers and in potycondensation {{as well as in}} polyaddition. Metal catalyzed polymerization reactions are chain reactions and necessitate to keep the valence of the metal constant. According to this definition redox polymerizations are not included as metal catalyzed polymerizations; the metal is not participating in the chain growth reaction. Polycondensations and polyadditions feasible by metal catalysis are chain reactions involving a change of the valence of the metal. These reactions are predominantly two electron processes Pd(0) = = Pd(ll), Rh(l) Rh(lll), Ru(0) = = Ru(ll). One electron processes are prevailing in oxidation reactions (Cu(l) Metal-catalyzed Polymerizations Chain reaction with constant valence of the meta...|$|E
