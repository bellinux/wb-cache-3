50|$|This four-horse mill {{is based}} on a central, vertical, heavy, 10 ft high, oak axle, with its base {{pivoting}} on an iron framework set {{in the middle of the}} gin gang floor. Its top end pivots under the mill's own tie beam (if it didn't, it would fall over) but the tie beam cannot rest on the pivot, or the mill would not turn. The main axle supports around its top end the main, 6 ft-diameter, horizontal gear wheel, with the teeth on the top surface. The <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft,</b> a massive oak pole, is girthed at one end by a secondary gear wheel which lies on the main gear wheel, thus turning the <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> on its long axis. The <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> runs from the main gear wheel through a hole in the threshing barn wall and in the barn it powers the threshing machine and other machines via further cogwheels and belts. Such a machine would create great torque stresses, and if it were ever to work again it would require re-engineering to ensure smooth and safe running, and beams which are seasoned and not cracked.|$|E

5000|$|... 1899: Employed as {{operating}} {{engineer at}} Gamlestadens Textile Industry in Göteborg {{where he worked}} many years {{to find a solution}} to the problems with frequent break downs in the ball bearings for the <b>main</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shafts.</b> This was caused by the ground conditions with lots of clay that the factory was built on and the shaft bearing supports moved some fractions of millimeters from time to time, hardly measurable, inducing enormous extra forces in the [...] "stiff" [...] bearings that was available at that time. Wingqvist spent more and more time on the development of bearings in general, collecting all sorts of technical achievements and new ideas that was presented continuously on the ball bearing concepts around Europe. In particular he carefully studied the report presented in 1902 by professor Richard Stribeck working at the Institute of Technology in Dresden, Germany, where he had compared ball bearings versus plain bearings from a scientific point of view. Wingqvist soon realized that the ball bearing techniques had a future and that there was room for innovations. On his initiative a small workshop was set up within the premises of Gamlestadens factory where they could carry out tests with different designs and steel materials. In 1906 he was granted a patent for a Single-row self-aligning ball bearing (Swedish patent reg. No. 24160) but this type of bearing had the disadvantage that it could not stand very much axial loads. His work continued in order to find the solution for a self-aligning bearing that also could carry some axial loads.|$|R

Substitution of composite material over the conventional steel material for <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> has increasing the advantages of design due to its high specific stiffness and strength. <b>Drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is the <b>main</b> component of <b>drive</b> system of an automobile. Use of conventional steel for manufacturing of <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> has many disadvantages such as low specific stiffness and strength. Conventional <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is made up into two parts to increase its fundamental natural bending frequency.

Many methods are available at present for the design optimization of structural systems and these methods based on mathematical programming techniques involving gradient search and direct search. These methods assume that the design variables are continuous. But in practical structural engineering optimization, almost all the design variables are discrete. This {{is due to the}} availability of components in standard sizes and constraints due to construction and manufacturing practices.

40|$|Final design {{details of}} a {{helicopter}} transmission that is powered by GE twin T 700 engines each rated at 1800 hp are presented. It is demonstrated that in comparison with conventional helicopter transmission arrangements the split torque design offers: weight reduction of 15 %; reduction in drive train losses of 9 %; and improved reliability resulting from redundant drive paths between the two engines and the main shaft. The transmission fits within the NASA LeRC 3000 hp Test Stand and accepts the existing positions for engine inputs, <b>main</b> <b>shaft,</b> connecting <b>drive</b> <b>shafts,</b> and the cradle attachment points. One necessary change to the test stand involved gear trains of different ratio in the tail drive gearbox. Progressive uprating of engine input power from 3600 to 4500 hp twin engine rating is allowed for in the design. In this way the test transmission will provide a base for several years of analytical, research, and component development effort targeted at improving the performance and reliability of helicopter transmission...|$|R

50|$|The mill was {{positioned}} {{close to the}} banks of Moonda-Waamba Creek to procure water for the boiler.
