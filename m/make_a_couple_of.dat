500|$|McCay {{pioneered the}} [...] "McCay Split System" [...] of animation, in which major poses or {{positions}} were drawn {{first and the}} intervening frames drawn after. [...] This relieved tedium and improved {{the timing of the}} film's actions. [...] McCay was open about the techniques that he developed, and refused to patent his system, reportedly saying, [...] "Any idiot that wants to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> thousand drawings for a hundred feet of film is welcome to join the club." [...] During production of Gertie, he showed the details to a visitor who claimed to be writing an article about animation. The visitor was animator John Randolph Bray, who sued McCay in 1914 after taking advantage of McCay's lapse to patent many of the techniques, including the use of registration marks, tracing paper, and the Mutoscope action viewer, and the cycling of drawings to create repetitive action. [...] The suit was unsuccessful, and there is evidence that McCay may have countersued—he received royalty payments from Bray for licensing the techniques.|$|E
500|$|The {{writers were}} new to screenwriting, so their film {{treatment}} ran to 110-pages; the average was 15 pages. Reitman and Simmons pitched it to various Hollywood studios. Simmons met with Ned Tanen, {{an executive at}} Universal Studios. He was encouraged by younger executives Sean Daniel and Thom Mount who were more receptive to the Lampoon type of humor; Mount had discovered the [...] "Seven Fires" [...] film treatment as Tanen's assistant, while investigating projects left by a fired studio executive. Tanen hated the idea. Ramis remembers, [...] "We went further than I think Universal expected or wanted. I think they were shocked and appalled. Chris' fraternity had virtually been a vomiting cult. And {{we had a lot}} of scenes that were almost orgies of vomit... We didn't back off anything". As the writers created more drafts of the screenplay (nine in total), the studio gradually became more receptive to the project, especially Mount, who championed it. The studio green-lighted the film and set the budget at a modest $3 million. Simmons remembers, [...] "They just figured, 'Screw it, it's a silly little movie, and we’ll <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> bucks if we're lucky—let them do whatever they want.' ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{been drawn}} to face Gillingham {{in the first round}} of the League Cup, the club's manager, Paul Sturrock, planned to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> changes to the team that faced Crystal Palace on the opening day of the new season, with youngster Joe Mason {{included}} in the squad. Two first-half goals were enough to take the hosts into the second round. Simeon Jackson put Gillingham ahead after 42 minutes and Andy Barcham scored a second just before the half-time break. Argyle reduced the deficit four minutes into the second-half when Luke Summerfield from a direct free kick, but they couldn't find an equaliser. The visitors should have forced extra time but Jamie Mackie spurned a chance when he pulled his shot wide with only the goalkeeper to beat. The defeat extended Sturrock's unfortunate run in the League Cup as a manager, having won just once in nine attempts. [...] "I must have the worst record of all managers in cup competitions, it's unbelievable," [...] he said. [...] "One or two of my defenders didn't defend properly tonight. It's not proper to name people but there were some glaring attempts to clear the ball and that's where we had problems." ...|$|E

500|$|The move {{paid off}} as Phil Esposito scored for Canada after just 30 seconds of play, {{knocking}} a puck {{out of the}} air behind the Soviets' goaltender Vladislav Tretiak. But even after a few minutes, Sinden felt the Soviets were coming on and having no difficulty getting through Canada's defence. Henderson scored after six minutes to give Canada a two-goal lead on a face-off win by Clarke, the only advantage that Team Canada had, in Sinden's estimation. To Canadian spectators and the media, the second goal gave the appearance that the pre-series predictions of a rout had been proven correct. But the Soviets got over any awe of the NHLers and scored two goals to tie the score {{before the end of the}} first period. Yevgeni Zimin scored on a pass from behind the net, and Vladimir Petrov scored a short-handed goal on a Soviet two-on-one break, with Petrov potting the rebound. According to Sinden, the Canadian players had lost their poise, [...] "running all over the ice" [...] to establish their hitting game, while the Soviets used an unexpected tactic, that of the long pass, to break a man out of their defensive zone. The Canadian defence was also dropping to the ice to block shots, while the Soviets only skated around the defence to get a good shot. Although Tretiak had given up the two Canada goals on the first two shots, he recovered later in the period to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> critical saves off Esposito at point-blank range. According to Esposito, [...] "at Christmas time, it would have been 4–0 for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fokker's first {{interest}} in flight stemmed from Wilbur Wright's exhibition flights in France {{in the summer}} and fall of 1908. In 1910, aged 20, Fokker was sent by his father to Germany to receive training as an automobile mechanic at Bingen Technical school, but his interest was in flying, so he transferred to the Erste deutsche Automobil-Fachschule in Mainz. That same year Fokker built his first aircraft [...] "de Spin" [...] ("the Spider"), which was destroyed by his business partner who flew it into a tree. He gained his flying certificate in his second [...] "Spin" [...] aircraft, which shortly thereafter was also destroyed by the same business partner, prompting Fokker to end their cooperation. In his own country, he became a celebrity by flying around the tower of the Grote or St.-Bavokerk in Haarlem on 1 September 1911, with the third version of the [...] "Spin".

50|$|The {{source of}} the Alster is a small bog pool in the Timhagen Brook near Henstedt-Ulzburg, {{approximately}} 25 km north of Hamburg. The small brook <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> curves before entering Hamburg territory at Duvenstedt und Wohldorf-Ohlstedt. At that point, the Alster has passed <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> smaller locks and has been passed by 15 bridges. From here on, Hamburgers use the river for water sports, especially for canoe and kayak trips on the river, or hikes along its shores. At Wellingsbüttel, the Alster runs past Wellingsbüttel Manor. At Ohlsdorf the Alster reaches a weir, approximately {{at the height of}} the former Fuhlsbüttel Lock, the last water level regulation before reaching the inner city. From Fuhlsbüttel downstream, the Alster's course, has been straightened on several locations, with old and new river beds occasionally forming parallel canal beds. Between city limits and the inner city's first lake − the Außenalster − the river is crossed by 42 bridges.|$|R

40|$|This book offers both a {{theoretical}} and empirical discussion of the psychology of ethics and care in a global world. Theoretically, the book seeks to problematize the concept of globalization, ethics and care by discussing how global-local linkages may be constructed in various ways and produce {{a number of different}} ethical results depending on context. The book <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> major contributions. First, it demonstrates how globalization, multiculturalism and group conflict must be reconceptualized from an ethical perspective if we are to appreciate and understand the extent to which people are likely to act on behalf of others in a global world. Second, it advances ethical ideas that provide new political and moral vocabularies that allow us to imagine social alternatives. The political psychology of real or perceived violence in a global world calls for new approaches to understanding collective experience. The book takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding how political, economic, social and psychological forces interact and are mutually reinforced in a global context...|$|R

Several men were going out, but the authorities were particular and refused everyone who had not had a hospital appointment. Someone suggested that, if the war went on, in a while they would be glad to take anyone who was qualified; but the general opinion was that it would be over in a month. Now that Roberts was there things would get all right in no time. This was Macalister's opinion too, and he had told Philip that they must watch their chance and buy just before peace was declared.
