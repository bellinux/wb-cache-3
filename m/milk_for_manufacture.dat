40|$|Aflatoxins are a {{group of}} {{naturally}} occurring toxins, which are secondary metabolites of some Aspergillus spp. When lactating animals ingest aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) contaminated feedstuffs, aflatoxin M 1 (AFM 1) may be excreted to milk. Thus, AFM 1 represents a potential hazardous to humans via consumption of milk and milk products. AFM 1 is less mutagenic and carcinogenic than AFB 1 but it exhibits high genotoxic activity. The maximum admissible level of this mycotoxin in raw milk, heat-treated milk and <b>milk</b> <b>for</b> <b>manufacture</b> of milkbased products was set at 0. 05 μg/Kg by the EC. In cheese production, high amount of a by product – cheese whey – products is obtained. Cheese represents about 10 % of the initial mass of milk. This cheese whey may be further processed when whey is to be turned into more valuable products than animal feed or whey powder. One way {{is the use of}} ultra filtration, yielding a protein rich fraction (retentate) and a lactose rich fraction (permeate). Since whey proteins have a number of useful nutritional and functional properties, whey proteins {{can be used in a}} wide range of commercial products such as food additives or may be fractionated into individual whey proteins. The aim of this work was to study the distribution of aflatoxin M 1 through the retentate and permeate when whey ultra filtration is carried out. To perform this study, cheese whey was spiked with AFM 1 at a level of 0. 1 μg l- 1. Under the used experimental conditions it was found that AFM 1 has a higher affinity for the rich protein fraction (retentate). These data will be presented and discussed...|$|E

In addition to its technological importance, {{a growing body of}} scientific evidence shows that strains belonging to the L. helveticus species have health-promoting properties. In this review, we synthesize the results of numerous primary literature papers concerning the ability of L. helveticus strains to positively influence human health. Several in vitro studies showed that L. helveticus possesses many common probiotic properties, such as the ability to survive gastrointestinal transit, adhere to epithelial cells and antagonize pathogens. In vivo studies in murine models showed that L. helveticus could prevent gastrointestinal infections, enhance protection against pathogens, modulate host immune responses, and affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Interventional studies and clinical trials have also demonstrated a number of health-promoting properties of L. helveticus. Finally, several studies suggested that specific enzymatic activities of L. helveticus could indirectly benefit the human host by enhancing the bioavailability of nutrients, removing allergens and other undesired molecules from food, and producing bioactive peptides through the digestion of food proteins. In conclusion, this review demonstrates that in light of the scientific literature presented, L. helveticus can be included among the bacterial species that are generally considered to be probiotic...|$|R

Standardized <b>milk</b> <b>for</b> yogurt <b>manufacture</b> was prepared, and calcium was added or removed from the system. Calcium was added as Ca {{in the form of}} CaCl (up to 13. 6 mM) or nonionic calcium as Gadocal-K (calcium potassium citrate; up to 49. 8 mM). Calcium was removed by chelating with sodium citrate (up to 16 mM) or by cation exchange with Amberlite IR- 120 plus (sodium form) resin (up to 10 g/L). Calcium chloride and sodium citrate were added either before or after heat treatment of milk, and nonionic calcium was added before heat treatment.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} fluorescence-labeled immunosorbent assay {{and qualitative}} on-site column tests were {{developed for the}} determination of aflatoxin M 1 in milk products. The use of liposomes loaded with quantum dots as a label significantly increased the assay sensitivity by encapsulating multiple quantum dots in a single liposome and, therefore, amplifying the analytical signal. Two different techniques were compared to obtain aflatoxin-protein conjugates, used for further coupling with the liposomes. The influence of nonspecific interactions of the liposome-labeled conjugates obtained with the surface of microtiter plates and column cartridges was evaluated and discussed. The limit of detection for fluorescence-labeled immunosorbent assay was 0. 014 mu g kg(- 1).

40|$|Cow 2 ̆ 7 s milk is principally {{made up of}} lactose, fat {{and protein}} {{together}} with minerals and vitamins. However, the prima compositional factor determining the processing quality of <b>milk</b> <b>for</b> the <b>manufacture</b> of cheese is the protein content. Milk with a high protein concentration, particularly casein content, gives a high yield of cheese, has good processability and produces good quality cheese. The higher the ratio of casein to whey proteins the more suitable is the <b>milk</b> <b>for</b> cheddar cheese. Fat content is also important but {{should be in the}} appropriate ratio to casein; the casein:fat ratio is generally between 0. 64 and 0. 72. The protein level in milk and its suitability for cheddar cheesemaking are affected by production factors such as stage of lactation, feed quality, herd health and environmental conditions. High-quality feed is the most important determinant of high protein milk. However, mastitis and environmental factors such as heat stress have negative effects. The effect of season appears to be small after the quality and availability of feed and climatic effects are taken into account. There is conflicting evidence {{of the relationship between the}} content of individual caseins and the suitability of <b>milk</b> <b>for</b> cheddar cheesemaking. However, evidence seems to be reasonably strong for a positive effect of κ-casein on micellar casein stability and superior cheesemaking properties. There is also a strong evidence for the effects of some genetic variants of milk proteins on cheddar cheesemaking. Milks containing the variants β-lactoglobulin BB and κ-casein BB, alone or in combination, have been shown to be superior to milks containing the corresponding AA or AB variants. The reason for this is not clear, but it is thought to be related to the differences in protein structure, increased ratio of κ-casein to other caseins and increased casein:whey protein ratio in these milks. Both positive and negative correlations between the contents of various minerals and salts, and the processability of <b>milk</b> <b>for</b> cheddar cheesemaking have also been reported.

The International Agency for the Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified it in group 2 B, thus possibly carcinogenic for humans. Their maximum limit in raw milk, heat-treated <b>milk</b> and <b>milk</b> <b>for</b> the <b>manufacture</b> of milk-based products, has been set by the Regulation (EC) 1881 of 2006 to 50 ng/kg. AFM 1 resists to the most common treatments of food industry and persists in processed product. Its occurrence has been registered throughout the whole dairy supply chain, including yogurts and cheeses, and it represents a serious risk for humans and animals. The development of mild, green and efficient methods for AFM 1 degradation is an actual and crucial topic. Aflatoxins degradation is difficult to achieve since they must not affect the organoleptic and nutritional qualities of food. In this work we evaluated the activity of a fungal laccase from Pleurotus eryngii for the degradation of AFM 1 in buffer solution and in skimmed UHT milk. We also analyzed the effects on the protein pattern of milk in order to evaluate its application {{for the improvement of}} the safety of milk based products. AFM 1 degradation in sodium acetate buffer (pH 6. 5 1 mM at 25 °C) was nearly 50 % after one hour and complete after 72 h.

Analysis of 6, 007 individual animal milks showed that only 1. 98 % of animals had the K-casein BB phenotype. No statistically significant associations (P AB>BB while the rate of curd firming and curd firmness values were such that K-casein AA<AB<BB (Chapters 2 & 5). The moisture adjusted Cheddar and Mozzarella cheese yields for AA and BB variant milks were 92. 5 and 100. 1, and 91. 5 and 102. 5 kg cheese/ 1000 kg milk, respectively. The moisture and protein adjusted Mozzarella cheese yields for K-casein AA, AB and BB variants were 90. 2, 93. 2 and 95. 2 kg cheese/ 1000 kg milk, respectively (Chapters 2 & 5). Cheddar cheeses made from K-casein BB variant milk had significantly higher (P< 0. 05) free amino acid levels after 270 days ripening than K-casein AA cheeses. Rheometric analysis during a 270 day ripening period showed that K-casein BB Cheddar cheeses were significantly softer (P< 0. 05) at 90 and 180 days and had a lower fracture stress at day 180 than AA variant cheeses. K-Casein variant had no significant effect on the sensory characteristics of Cheddar cheese (Chapter 3 & 4). Furthermore, K-casein variant had no significant effect on the proteolysis (nitrogen soluble at pH 4. 60 and nitrogen soluble in 5 % phosphotungstic acid), rheological (hardness) or functional characteristics (melt, flow and stretch) of Mozzarella (Chapter 5). Given the above results, it was concluded that K-casein BB variant milk resulted in improved rennet coagulation properties and higher yields of Cheddar and Mozzarella cheese while having no detrimental effects on cheese quality. Furthermore, increasing the frequency of the B variant of K-casein in Irish Holstein Friesian dairy herds should be beneficial in the production of <b>milk</b> <b>for</b> the <b>manufacture</b> of Cheddar and Mozzarella cheese...|$|R
40|$|What is {{the ideal}} <b>milk</b> {{composition}} <b>for</b> cheese <b>manufacture?</b> How close is Wisconsin milk to that ideal, {{and how does it}} compare with milk from other leading dairy states? What can Wisconsin’s dairy farmers and cheese processors do to ensure that milk produced in the state improves the state’s cheese industry from farm to wholesale product? These questions are addressed in this report, which supports Rethinking Dairyland leaflet No. 7. WHAT COMPOSITION AND QUALITY OF MILK DO CHEESE PROCESSORS NEED? The ideal <b>milk</b> <b>for</b> making a whole milk cheese, e. g. Cheddar, would contain 14 - 15 percent total solids and have a casein-to-fat ratio of about 0. 7. This would typically be milk with about 4. 2 percent fat and about 3. 6 percent true protein. Few, if any, cows produce milk of this composition. So cheese makers standardize their milk using a variety of processes. Fat content may be reduced through cream separation. Solids content may be increased through vacuum pasteurization or by adding additional nonfat milk solids to the raw milk in the form of condensed skim milk, nonfat dry milk or ultrafiltered milk concentrate. Basically, the two main ingredients of milk that a cheese maker needs are casein and fat. The amount of fat {{that can be used in}} a cheese make procedure is limited by the amount of casein present to hold the fat in a stable system. Thus, the casein to fat ratio is a critical one determining the cheese making potential of a milk supply. The final composition of a cheese will dictate what amount of casein and fat are required to make that cheese. Ideal casein to fat ratios (based on recommendations from the WI Center for Dairy Research) for some varieties of cheese are shown in Table 1. ...|$|R
