40|$|Measurement and {{variation}} {{control of}} geometrical Key Characteristics (KCs), such as flatness and gap of joint faces, coaxiality of cabin sections, is the crucial issue in large components assembly from the aerospace industry. Aiming to control geometrical KCs and {{to attain the}} best fit of posture, an optimization algorithm based on KCs for large components assembly is proposed. This approach regards the posture best fit, which is a key activity in Measurement Aided Assembly (MAA), as a two-phase optimal problem. In the first phase, the global measurement coordinate system of digital model and shop floor is unified with minimum error based on singular value decomposition, and the current posture of components being assembly is optimally solved in terms of minimum variation of all reference points.

40|$|The {{observation}} that a starchless mutant (TC 7) of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. is gravitropic (T. Caspar and B. G. Pickard, 1989, Planta 177, 185 - 197) {{raises questions about}} the hypothesis that starch and amyloplasts play a role in gravity perception. We compared the kinetics of gravitropism in this starchless mutant and the wild-type (WT). Wild-type roots are more responsive to gravity than TC 7 roots as judged by several parameters: (1) Vertically grown TC 7 roots were not as oriented with respect to the gravity vector as WT roots. (2) In the time course of curvature after gravistimulation, curvature in TC 7 roots was delayed and reduced compared to WT roots. (3) TC 7 roots curved less than WT roots following a single, short (induction) period of gravistimulation, and WT, but not TC 7, roots curved in response to a 1 -min period of horizontal exposure. (4) Wild-type roots curved much more than TC 7 roots in response to intermittent stimulation (repeated short periods of horizontal exposure); WT roots curved in response to 10 s of stimulation or less, but TC 7 roots required 2 min of stimulation to produce a curvature. The growth rates were equal for both genotypes. We conclude that WT roots are more sensitive to gravity than TC 7 roots. Starch is not required for gravity perception in TC 7 roots, but is necessary for full sensitivity; thus it is likely that amyloplasts function as statoliths in WT Arabidopsis roots. Furthermore, since centrifugation studies using low gravitational forces indicated that starchless plastids are relatively dense and are the most <b>movable</b> <b>component</b> in TC 7 columella cells, the starchless plastids may also function as statoliths...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the optomechanical properties of an optical cavity containing, as a mirror, a multilayer membrane composed of tris(8 -hydroxyquinoline) aluminium (Alq 3), silver and silicon nitride. Alq 3 is an organic semi-conductor compound which shows photoluminescence at 500 nm with absorption peaked at 405 nm. These properties, {{together with the}} relative ease with which it can be prepared in thin ﬁlms, are the reasons why it is already being used in applications such as OLEDs and photovoltaic cells. Alq 3 may also prove useful in optomechanics thanks to, for instance, cooling due to forces photo-induced by interaction between electron-hole pairs and mechanical vibrational modes. The typical experimental setup in optomechanics consists of an optical cavity {{where one of the}} end-mirrors can move as an oscillator. Forces are exerted on the oscillator by the light in a resonator-like conﬁguration. This forces may have diﬀerent origins, for example radiation pressure, due to momentum exchange in collisions between photons and the oscillator, and photothermal deformation, due to heating by light absorption. The consequent mechanical response shifts the optical resonance frequency of the resonator, altering the intensity of the intra-cavity ﬁeld and thus the forces. This way, a coupling between light ﬁeld in the resonator and mechanical motion is established. The light-induced forces respond to a displacement of the <b>movable</b> <b>component</b> with a time lag, given by the ﬁnite lifetime of photons inside the resonator for the radiation pressure and diﬀusion time of heat in the oscillator for the photothermal force. In a linearised dynamics regime, this retardation enables cooling/heating of the mechanical modes of motion as extraction/insertion of work by the light ﬁeld. Moreover, non-linear dynamical eﬀects arise when the mechanical modes are heated, of which multistability and auto-oscillations are some examples. In our experiment, the multilayer membrane is clamped but able to bend and vibrate according to vibrational modes due to its geometry and boundary conditions. An eﬀective temperature for each mode is identiﬁed with the amount of its associated thermal energy. Cooling or heating is thus experienced as a decrease or increase of this energy. We produced software simulations of our system driven by two diﬀerent wave- lengths, one inside and one outside the absorption spectrum of Alq 3. This allows to compute the absorption in each layer and to simulate how it varies due to changes in the membrane’s layered structure. We then show how cooling is induced on two vibrational modes of the membrane through photothermal forces mediated by light absorption in the Alq 3 at its absorption wavelength and Ag outside the absorption spectrum. Moreover, we made preliminary investigations on the non-linear dynamics arising by photothermal-induced heating, which yield instabilities depending on the initial conditions of laser power and detuning from resonance...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} we’ve {{encountered}} new attention regarding musealizzazione on site of archaeological heritage, in Italy {{as well as}} at international level. A wide array of technical meetings and conferences have brought the matter to attention worldwide. We are in need of a definition for the main subject of this issue, in order to acknowledge the area involved by this research. Archaeology and musealizzazione disciplines have points in common regarding protection and enhancement of assets. An archaeological site is intrinsically a three dimensional portion of space in which we can notice a wide variety of physical transformations due both to nature and mankind, with the result of a place where space and time are built in as one. Usually an archaeological site undergoes two different stages, conservation and musealizzazione, being divided in movable and non <b>movable</b> <b>components.</b> The first ones are typically assigned to conservation in environments not directly referring to the site, guaranteeing an high level of conservation and enhancement. Non <b>movable</b> <b>components</b> remain in place where they have been found, creating a portion of ground called “site”. Separation of these components usually distorts the completeness of finding on a large scale, as well as comprehension of an archaeological site both historically and anthropologically. Musealizzazione on site is therefore necessary in order to protect assets and return them to the community. Involvement of different professional figures must emerge in every aspect of enhancement of an archaeological asset, but mainly during the process from excavation through enhancement. This procedure can be associated to the process intending to realize an asset in other fields. From this similarity rises an identification that shall be called “archaeological process”. “ The Archaeological process” is the procedure that an archaeological area performs from its finding to its enhancement, representing throughout musealizzazione on site the whole process of enhancement of movable and non movable assets, including practices (excavation, analysis, cataloguing, restoration) performed to make them usable and perceptible by the community. “The Archaeological process” surely needs continuous technological innovation regarding protection and communication of findings, not only about materials used in the process but also about different communication aspects of findings and of site itself...|$|R
