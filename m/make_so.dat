500|$|Some of James's biographers {{conclude}} that Esmé Stewart (later Duke of Lennox), Robert Carr (later Earl of Somerset), and George Villiers (later Duke of Buckingham) were his lovers. Sir John Oglander observed that he [...] "never yet saw any fond husband <b>make</b> <b>so</b> much or so great dalliance over his beautiful spouse as I have seen King James over his favourites, especially the Duke of Buckingham" [...] whom the King would, recalled Sir Edward Peyton, [...] "tumble and kiss as a mistress."

500|$|Later in 1994, Dunst co-starred in {{the drama}} film Little Women {{opposite}} Winona Ryder and Claire Danes. The film received favorable reviews. Critic Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film was the greatest adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel {{of the same name}} and remarked on Dunst's performance, [...] "The perfect contrast to take-charge Jo comes from Kirsten Dunst's scene-stealing Amy, whose vanity and twinkling mischief <b>make</b> <b>so</b> much more sense coming from an 11-year-old vixen than they did from grown-up Joan Bennett in 1933.

500|$|Campbell {{continued}} to publish technological sf alongside the soft science fiction. [...] One example was Cleve Cartmill's [...] "Deadline", {{a story about}} the development of the atomic bomb. [...] It appeared in 1944, when the Manhattan Project was still not known to the public; Cartmill used his background in atomic physics to assemble a plausible story that had strong similarities to the real-world secret research program. [...] Military Intelligence agents called on Campbell to investigate, and were satisfied when he explained how Cartmill had been able to <b>make</b> <b>so</b> many accurate guesses. [...] In the words of science fiction critic John Clute, [...] "Cartmill's prediction made sf fans enormously proud", as some considered the story proof that science fiction could be predictive of the future.|$|E
500|$|The {{rebuilding}} {{caused a}} certain amount of controversy among footplate crews, with some maintaining that one could not <b>make</b> <b>so</b> many changes and have a reliable locomotive {{at the end of the}} process. The class suffered on the South Western section from the expectation that they were an improved version of the N15 [...] "King Arthur" [...] class. Once this misconception was overcome, the class came into their own on the Basingstoke services, where their ability to accelerate well was put to good use. [...] However, the rebuilds gained a reputation for roughriding and relatively poor efficiency when compared to the N15s, and were dissimilar in performance to the original L class locomotives, making them unpopular with crews. [...] Because of this, the class was used on secondary duties, crosscountry and interregional trains around Basingstoke rather than the heavy London to Exeter expresses for which they were intended.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} {{were created by}} Sony Pictures Imageworks, who collaborated with Bryan Singer on Superman Returns. The VFX company's two key goals were to {{accurately}} portray von Stauffenberg's injuries {{and to create a}} 1943 period look to Berlin. With many explosions and stunts seen in the film performed practically, the majority of the 800 computer-generated effects shots were used to portray von Stauffenberg's injuries. A digital version of Cruise's hand was designed, and VFX employees rotoscoped the hand in every movement it could <b>make</b> <b>so</b> the missing fingers were erased in the process. With many close-ups of von Stauffenberg's hand with missing fingers, the injuries were textured to look like actual scars, particularly based on surgical procedures from 1943. Cruise asked for advice on how to best move his hands so visual effects would be easier to apply, but some challenges, such as von Stauffenberg getting dressed on his own, were inescapable. According to VFX supervisor Richard R. Hoover, [...] "We know from historical accounts that von Stauffenberg didn't stick {{his hands in his pockets}} to try and hide his injuries." ...|$|E
500|$|Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: Cheek to Cheek Live! {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Kathryn Shattuck of The New York Times {{said that is}} difficult to recognize Lady Gaga [...] "out of her usual get-ups: the meat dresses, seashell bikinis, towering stilettos and skyscraper hair" [...] and praised Bennett's vocals [...] "his voice still strong at 88, take on the Great American Songbook and prove again that the classics can bridge many divides." [...] Soraya Nadia McDonald of The Washington Post wrote [...] "It's become practically cliché to note what an odd couple they <b>make,</b> <b>so</b> we'll just remind you they're actually both divine live performers and they've got great chemistry." [...] Jeff Pfeiffer from Channel Guide said that although Bennett and Gaga [...] "engage in some playfulness and camaraderie which is generally fun, though Lady Gaga may be trying too hard at times". He added that [...] "The artists and the terrific orchestra are in fine form, and though the editing between numbers seemed a bit rapid on occasion, the production and directing is effective to capture the performances".|$|E
500|$|Chang of Variety {{commented that}} it [...] "plays like The Karate Kid with a pro-literacy agenda, pushing {{all the right}} {{emotional}} buttons yet hitting quite a few wrong ones in the process." [...] The Evening Chronicles review said it [...] "conceals few narrative surprises" [...] but contended that [...] "when [...] does finally defy our expectations, it's to ensure his spellers learn a valuable lesson about integrity." [...] Turan of the Los Angeles Times criticized that the film [...] "telegraphs its plot"; however, he praised it as [...] "genuinely sweet and determinedly inspirational." [...] PopMatterss Cynthia Fuchs stated it is formulaic as it has some [...] "conventions that <b>make</b> <b>so</b> many other genre films feel stale," [...] but that it [...] "torques them slightly", emphasizing the [...] "intellectual activities" [...] Akeelah gets involved with. Furthermore, the film was described as [...] "derivatively entertaining in a feel-good sort of way" [...] by Rick Groen in an article for The Globe and Mail. Ingman of The Austin Chronicle {{described it as a}} typical sports film and felt it was heavy-handed at times. However, she praised it for its thems and called the film a [...] "houghtful, engaging," [...] one and said it has [...] "cross-gender appeal". Morris of The Boston Globe argued, [...] "If Akeelah and the Bee is a generic, well-oiled commercial contraption, it is the first to credibly dramatize the plight of a truly gifted, poor black child." [...] Morris added, [...] "Obviously, it's emotional propaganda. But it's just the kind of propaganda our children need." ...|$|E

500|$|During the {{presentation}} of evidence against her, Mary broke down and pointed accusingly at Walsingham saying, [...] "all {{of this is the}} work of Monsieur de Walsingham for my destruction", to which he replied, [...] "God is my witness that as a private person I have done nothing unworthy of an honest man, and as Secretary of State, nothing unbefitting my duty." [...] Mary was found guilty and the warrant for her execution was drafted, but Elizabeth hesitated to sign it, despite pressure from Walsingham. Walsingham wrote to Paulet urging him to find [...] "some way to shorten the life" [...] of Mary to relieve Elizabeth of the burden, to which Paulet replied indignantly, [...] "God forbid that I should <b>make</b> <b>so</b> foul a shipwreck of my conscience, or leave so great a blot to my poor posterity, to shed blood without law or warrant." [...] Walsingham made arrangements for Mary's execution; Elizabeth signed the warrant on 1 February 1587 and entrusted it to William Davison, who had been appointed as junior Secretary of State in late September 1586. Davison passed the warrant to Cecil and a privy council convened by Cecil without Elizabeth's knowledge agreed to carry out the sentence as soon as was practical. Within a week, Mary was beheaded. On hearing of the execution, Elizabeth claimed not to have sanctioned the action and that she had not meant Davison to part with the warrant. Davison was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Walsingham's share of Elizabeth's displeasure was small because he was absent from court, at home ill, in the weeks just before and after the execution. Davison was eventually released in October 1588, on the orders of Cecil and Walsingham.|$|E

2500|$|In making Stagecoach, Ford faced entrenched {{industry}} prejudice {{about the}} now-hackneyed genre which, ironically, {{he had helped}} to <b>make</b> <b>so</b> popular.

As a result, Ford shopped the project around Hollywood for almost a year, offering it unsuccessfully to both Joseph Kennedy and David O. Selznick before finally linking with Walter Wanger, an independent producer working through United Artists.|$|E
2500|$|The {{coordination}} of the ringers requires {{a different approach}} than other ensembles. All the ringers read from a score. This score {{is similar to a}} piano score, but with an additional convention: The C above middle C and all notes below are always written in the bass clef, and the D above middle C and all notes above are always written in the treble clef. (This formatting is not always the convention for solo and small-ensemble music.)

2500|$|The {{contents}} of the First Folio were compiled by Heminges and Condell; {{the members of the}} Stationers Company who published the book were the booksellers Edward Blount and the father/son team of William and Isaac Jaggard. William Jaggard has seemed an odd choice by the King's Men because he had published the questionable collection The Passionate Pilgrim as Shakespeare's, and in 1619 had printed new editions of 10 Shakespearean quartos to which he did not have clear rights, some with false dates and title pages (the False Folio affair). Indeed, his contemporary Thomas Heywood, whose poetry Jaggard had pirated and misattributed to Shakespeare, specifically reports that Shakespeare was [...] "much offended with M.

Now Then was the first album for former Tom Robinson band's drummer Dolphin Taylor. In the face of low sales and concert attendances, they broke up in 1983, when Burns said: [...] "Our last LP Now Then was to my mind the best album we have made.
