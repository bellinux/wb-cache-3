40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of <b>microwave</b> coagulation <b>therapy</b> for metastatic liver cancer, nine cases of colorectal cancer and one case of duodenal cancer ware studied. Hepatectomy was not done in all cases. <b>Microwave</b> coagulation <b>therapy</b> was done with sonographically guide percutaneous insertion of a needle-electrode (P-MCT). Treated metastatic liver nodules were under 3 cm in diameter. Primary lesions were treated by radical excision. P-MCT was repeated 5 to 6 times to treat one nodule. Six of 10 patients had metachronous liver metastasis. Liver tumors were detected at 4 -to 8 -month intervals. Whenever a nodule was detected, P-MCT was performed. In 3 of 6 patients {{there were no signs}} of recurrence after 12 to 42 months of follow up, including no elevation in CEA levels. Achieving a recurrence-free state in 3 patients with metachronous metastatic liver cancers was the best indication of P-MCT.

All patients were alive without recurrence of hepatic tumor but with high CEA levels. One patient was found to have a lung metastasis 18 months after primary operation.

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Microwave</b> Resonance <b>Therapy</b> (MRT) {{is a novel}} medical treatment, which {{represents}} a synthesis of the ancient Chinese traditional knowledge in medicine (acupuncture) and recent breakthroughs in biophysics. Affecting the appropriate acupuncture points by the generation of high frequency microwaves (52 - 78 GHz), remarkable clinical results of the treatment are being achieved. In this paper the quantum-like macroscopic biophysical bases of the MRT are elaborated too, offering a new insight in the mechanisms of the assembling gap junction hemichannels upon the internal microwave (MW) electromagnetic field spatio-temporal maximums at the temporary position of the acupuncture system, and hence the very biophysical nature of the temporary psychosomatic health or disease. Such a picture also supports the EM/ionic "optical" ultralowfrequency modulated MW quantum holographic neural network-like function of the acupuncture system (similar to complex-valued oscillatory holographic Hopfield-like neural networks), and its essential relation to consciousness, as strongly suggested from biophysical modeling of altered states of consciousness.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{surgical}} procedure for symptomatic {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} is transurethral resection of the prostate. However, this procedure has complications, including bleeding, erectile dysfunction, and retrograde ejaculation. Alternative therapies have been developed {{with the aim of}} reducing the level of complications while maintaining efficacy. These include <b>microwave</b> <b>therapy,</b> transurethral needle ablation, and a range of laser procedures. Recently, photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) was introduced using the GreenLight 60 -W laser (American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA) and later the 80 -W laser, which is the predominant device used in PVP trials. The latest evolution is the GreenLight HPS 120 -W laser (532 nm), which produces not only rapid vaporization of prostate tissue but also an acceptable rate of complications. Here we present a review of complications associated with surgical therapies for benign prostatic hyperplasia including data on the initial use of the GreenLight HPS 120 -W system. Recommendations are provided on how the low complication rates achieved with PVP can be reduced even further through modification of the operating procedure. (c) 2008 European Association of Urology.

40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} <b>microwave</b> thermal <b>therapies</b> {{are being}} developed {{for the treatment of}} small renal cell carcinomas (RCC, d< 3 cm). This study assessed the thermal history and corresponding tissue injury patterns resulting from microwave treatment of the porcine renal cortex. Three groups of kidneys were evaluated: (1) in vitro treated, (2) in vivo with 2 -h post-treatment perfusion (acute) and (3) in vivo with 7 -day post-treatment perfusion (chronic). The kidneys were treated with an interstitial water-cooled microwave probe (Urologix, Plymouth, MN) that created a lesion centered in the renal cortex (50 W for 10 min). The thermal histories were recorded at 0. 5 cm radial intervals from the probe axis for correlation with the histologic cellular and vascular injury. The kidneys showed a reproducible 2 cm chronic lesion with distinct histologic injury zones identified. The thermal histories at the edge of these zones were found using Lagrangian interpolation. The threshold thermal histories for microvascular injury and stasis appeared to be lower than that for renal epithelial cell injury. The Arrhenius kinetic injury models were fit to the thermal histories and injury data to determine the kinetic parameters (i. e. activation energy and frequency factor) for the thermal injury processes. The resultant activation energies are consistent in magnitude with those for thermally induced protein denaturation. A 3 -D finite element thermal model based on the Pennes bioheat equation was developed and solved using ANSYS (V 7. 0). The real geometry of the kidneys studied and temperature dependent thermal properties were used in this model. The specific absorption rate (SAR) of the microwave probe required for the thermal modelling was experimentally determined. The results from the thermal modelling suggest that the complicated change of local renal blood perfusion with temperature and time during <b>microwave</b> thermal <b>therapy</b> can be predicted, although a first order kinetic model may be insufficient to capture blood flow changes. The local blood perfusion was found to be a complicated function of temperature and time. A non-linear model based on the degree of vascular stasis was introduced to predict the blood perfusion. In conclusion, interstitial <b>microwave</b> thermal <b>therapy</b> in the normal porcine kidney results in predictable thermal and tissue injury behaviour. Future work in human kidney tissue will be necessary to confirm the clinical significance of these results...|$|R
