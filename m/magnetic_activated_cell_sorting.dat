40|$|The well {{documented}} source for adult multipotent stem cells is spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) of mammalian testis. It is foundation of spermatogenesis in the testis throughout adult life by balancing self-renewal and differentiation. SSCs isolation from mammalian testis {{is difficult because}} of their scarcity {{and the lack of}} well characterized cell surface markers. Thus, the isolation of SSCs is of great interest for exploration of spermatogonial physiology and therapeutic approaches for fertility preservation. CD 9 is a surface marker expressed in mouse and rat male germline stem cells. In this study, CD 9 positive SSCs were successfully isolated from the goat testis using enzymatic digestion followed by three step purification: Differential plating, Percoll discontinuous density gradient followed by <b>Magnetic</b> <b>activated</b> <b>cell</b> <b>sorting</b> (MACS). Percoll discontinuous density gradient showed significant differences in the percentage of CD 9 + SSCs across individual fraction. The fraction 36 % and 40 % gave the highest percentage of CD 9 + SSCs i. e. 82 % ± 1. 2 and 9. 2 % ± 1. 3 respectively. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>activated</b> <b>cell</b> <b>sorting</b> of CD 9 + cells in the magnetic fraction of goat testes was in the range of 15 % - 18 % which is upto threefolds. CD 9 + SSCs were further recovered with appreciable efficiency after immunomagnetic isolation by using various bead: cells ratio in which 4 : 1 ratio gave the highest yield of 69. 06 × 105 with 18 % of CD 9 + SSCs. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>activated</b> <b>cell</b> <b>sorting</b> using anti-CD 9 antibodies provides an efficient and fast approach as compared to conventional approaches such as differential plating and percoll discontinuous density gradient for enrichment strategy for spermatogonial stem cells from goat testes for undertaking research on basic and applied reproductive biology...|$|E

40|$|Host Defense Peptides (HDPs) are small, {{cationic}} and amphipathic molecules with inherent antimicrobial and immunomodular function. However {{their effects}} on blood-derived T cells is unknown and {{is the focus of}} this investigation. In this thesis, porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptide (BMAP) - 27, BMAP- 28, Indolicidin (Indol), or HH 2 in the presence and absence of Concanavalin A (ConA). It was observed that BMAP- 27, BMAP- 28, and Indol inhibited ConA-stimulated porcine PBMC proliferation. To ensure that the observed effect on cell proliferation was not simply due to a physical interaction between the peptide and ConA, addition of peptide and ConA was staggered. Porcine CD 4 +/CD 8 + T cells were isolated from blood using <b>magnetic</b> <b>activating</b> <b>cell</b> <b>sorting</b> (MACS) and it was determined that BMAP- 27 and BMAP- 28 inhibited ConA-stimulated T cell proliferation. They did not promote T cell necrosis, but approximately 40 % of the <b>activated</b> T <b>cells</b> undergoes apoptosis in the presence of BMAP- 27 and BMAP- 28. The remaining 60 % of the T cells consumed very little ATP and showed an increase in expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen- 4 (CTLA- 4), indicating the induction of T cell anergy. The addition of exogenous IL- 2 decreased the surface expression of CTLA- 4 in ConA- activated CD 4 + T cells and induced renewed CD 4 +/CD 8 + T cell proliferation, an indicator that these cells underwent activation-induced anergy. Thus, we submit that BMAP- 27 and BMAP- 28 {{may play a role in}} returning the <b>activated</b> T <b>cell</b> population to a homeostatic state through induction of peripheral tolerance mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|A {{bacterial}} display methodology {{was developed}} for N- and C-terminal display and demonstrated to enable rapid screening of very large peptide libraries with high precision and efficiency. To overcome limitations of insertional fusion display libraries, a new scaffold was developed through circular permutation of the Escherichia coli outer membrane protein OmpX that presents both N and C termini on the external cell surface. Circularly permuted OmpX (CPX) display was directly compared to insertional fusion display by screening comparable peptide libraries in each format using <b>magnetic</b> and fluorescence <b>activated</b> <b>cell</b> <b>sorting.</b> CPX display enabled in situ measurement of dissociation rate constants with improved accuracy and, consequently, improved affinity discrimination during screening and ranking of isolated clones. Using streptavidin as a model target, bacterial display yielded the well-characterized HPQ/M motif obtained previously using several alternative peptide display systems, as well as three additional motifs (LI/V CQNVCY, CGWMYF/YxEC, ERCWYVMHWPCNA). Using CPX display, a very high affinity streptavidin-binding peptide was isolated having a dissociation rate constant koff = 0. 002 sec- 1 even after grafting to the C terminus of an unrelated protein. Comparison of individual clones obtained from insertional fusion and terminal fusion libraries suggests that the N-terminal display yields sequences with greater diversity, affinity, and modularity. CPX bacterial display thus provides a highly effective method for screening peptide libraries to rapidly generate ligands with high affinity and specificity...|$|R

METHODS: Dental pulp and periodontal ligament were obtained from normal human impacted third molars. The tissues were digested in collagenase/dispase to generate single cell suspensions. Cells were cultured in alpha-MEM supplemented with 20 % fetal bovine serum, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 microM l-ascorbate- 2 -phosphate. <b>Magnetic</b> and fluorescence <b>activated</b> <b>cell</b> <b>sorting</b> were employed to characterize the phenotype of freshly isolated and ex vivo expanded cell populations. The developmental potential of cultured cells was assessed following co-transplantation with hydroxyapetite/tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) particles into immunocompromised mice for 8 weeks. RESULTS: MSC were identified in adult human dental pulp (dental pulp stem cells, DPSC), human primary teeth (stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth, SHED), and periodontal ligament (periodontal ligament stem cells, PDLSC) by their capacity to generate clongenic cell clusters in culture. Ex vivo expanded DPSC, SHED, and PDLSC populations expressed a heterogeneous assortment of makers associated with MSC, dentin, bone, smooth muscle, neural tissue, and endothelium. PDLSC were also found to express the tendon specific marker, Scleraxis. Xenogeneic transplants containing HA/TCP with either DPSC or SHED generated donor-derived dentin-pulp-like tissues with distinct odontoblast layers lining the mineralized dentin-matrix. In parallel studies, PDLSC generated cementum-like structures associated with PDL-like connective tissue when transplanted with HA/TCP into immunocompromised mice. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data revealed the presence of distinct MSC populations associated with dental structures with the potential of stem cells to regenerate living human dental tissues in vivo.
