5|$|After {{his term}} began in 2001, Cheney was {{occasionally}} {{asked if he}} was interested in the Republican nomination for the 2008 elections. However, he always <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> he wished to retire upon the expiration of his term and he did not run in the 2008 presidential primaries. The Republicans nominated Arizona Senator John McCain.|$|E
5|$|As a Justice, Black {{held the}} view that the Court should {{literally}} enforce constitutional guarantees, especially the First Amendment free speech clause. He was often labeled an ‘activist’ because of his willingness to review legislation that arguably violated constitutional provisions. Black <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> literalism was necessary to cabin judicial power.|$|E
5|$|During Bush's second term, a {{controversy}} arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys. The White House <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, {{along with other}} {{senior members of the}} Justice Department. The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege. Bush <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal.|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} {{material}} composition {{is one of}} the most hotly debated topics in contemporary ontology. Some ontologists <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> there are no composite material objects at all. Some <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> organisms are the only composite material objects. Others <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> for any material objects, there is something composed of them. A closely related debate concern...|$|R
50|$|One {{thing that}} clearly distinguishes Kantian deontologism from divine command deontology is <b>that</b> Kantianism <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> man, as a {{rational}} being, makes the moral law universal. Whereas, divine command <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> God makes the moral law universal.|$|R
5000|$|While some <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> Christ merely {{descended into}} the [...] "limbo of the fathers", others, notably theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar (inspired by the visions of Adrienne von Speyr), <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> {{it was more}} than this and that the descent {{involved}} suffering by Jesus. [...] Some <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> this is a matter on which differences and theological speculation are permissible without transgressing the limits of orthodoxy. However, Balthasar's point here has been forcefully condemned by conservative Catholic outlets.|$|R
5|$|Filming {{finished}} on December 12, 2006 in Molokai, and {{the first}} assembly cut was three hours. Twenty minutes were removed, not including end credits, though producer Jerry Bruckheimer <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> the long running time was {{needed to make the}} final battle work in terms of build-up.|$|E
5|$|In Giessen, Forester Ritter {{was arrested}} {{because he said}} the war would last another three years. Two years ago R. was assassinated because he <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> the war would last two years.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, little reliable evidence about {{the kingdom of the}} East Angles has survived. The historian Barbara Yorke has <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> {{this is due to the}} destruction of the kingdom's monasteries and the disappearance of both of the East Anglian sees, which were caused by Viking raids and later settlement.|$|E
25|$|There {{exists a}} wide range of {{philosophical}} views on humans' obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of ethical altruism <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is ethical egoism, which <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism, which <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants.|$|R
25|$|The {{essential}} {{difference is}} in what determines {{whether or not}} an action is the right action. Act utilitarianism <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> an action is right if it maximizes utility; rule utilitarianism <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> an action is right if it conforms to a rule that maximizes utility.|$|R
5000|$|The scholar K. Paul Johnson <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "Masters" [...] that Madame Blavatsky {{wrote about}} and {{produced}} letters from were actually idealizations {{of people who}} were her mentors. In an article in the New York Times, Paul Zweig <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Elsie and Frances {{admitted}} that the photographs were faked, using cardboard cutouts of fairies copied from a popular children's book of the time, but Frances <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> the fifth and final photograph was genuine. The photographs {{and two of the}} cameras used are on display in the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, England.|$|E
5|$|Jean Buridan (1300–1358) also {{rejected}} {{the notion that}} this motion-generating property, which he named impetus, dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by {{the resistance of the}} air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. He also <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of momentum. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other peripatetic views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.|$|E
5|$|One {{conservation}} specialist welcomed {{this proposal}} {{as it would}} make captive breeding programmes and future rewilding of zoo-born tigers easier. One geneticist was sceptical of this study and <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> the currently recognised nine subspecies can be distinguished genetically.|$|E
50|$|Many authors <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> the pre-tribulation rapture {{doctrine}} {{originated in}} the eighteenth century, with the Puritan preachers Increase and Cotton Mather, and was then popularized in the 1830s by John Darby. Others, including Grant Jeffrey, <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> an earlier document called Ephraem or Pseudo-Ephraem already supported a pre-tribulation rapture.|$|R

5|$|Since the {{national}} park's creation, debates have arisen on its {{management and the}} impacts on {{the population of the}} upland. Inhabitants of the area criticized management for not respecting their history and traditions, and cited farming activities banned on several occasions. Park officials <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> every activity was possible under certain conditions.|$|E
5|$|Sir Edward Guildford died in 1534 {{before he}} could draw up his last will. Since his son Richard had predeceased him, Guildford's nephew, John Guildford, claimed the inheritance. The Dudleys <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> Guildford's {{daughter}} Jane was the natural heir. They finally won the resulting court case {{with the assistance of}} Thomas Cromwell.|$|E
5|$|Some {{witnesses}} <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> the killer's {{claim to}} be John A. Covington was telling. They said that both Sharp and Beauchamp had been acquainted with John W. Covington, and that Beauchamp often mistakenly called him John A. Covington. Other witnesses told of threats they had heard Beauchamp make against Sharp.|$|E
40|$|Transhumanism <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> {{technology}} will allow humans to de - velop beyond all known limits. This essay <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> this entails both an epistemology and an anthropology that are inherently inconsistent. As an allegedly experience based ideology employing oncepts traditionally {{reserved for the}} divine and the metaphysical, transhumanism therefore does not make sense...|$|R
5000|$|Indeterminists do {{not have}} to deny that causes exist. Instead, they can <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> the only causes that exist are of a type that do not {{constrain}} the future to a single course; for instance, they can <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> only necessary and not sufficient causes exist. The necessary/sufficient distinction works as follows: ...|$|R

5|$|The {{tactical}} {{assessment of}} both sides was radically different. Bomber Command believed the attack was a failure {{as a result of}} poor formation flying and leadership. It was also <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> better beam defensive armament and self-sealing fuel tanks were needed. These tactical considerations might, they believed, still salvage the day-bomber concept.|$|E
5|$|A weak wave in the ITCZ {{organized}} into Tropical Depression Ten-E on August 30. It headed west-northwest and quickly intensified into {{a tropical storm}} and eventually, a hurricane. Hernan then began rapidly deepening, reaching Category5 intensity on September 1. It <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> intensity for 12hours before tracking over cooler waters. The storm weakened steadily, with wind shear contributing to its deterioration. Hernan then degenerated into a remnant low on September 6. The low turned to the southwest and dissipated three days later.|$|E
5|$|According to the Earps' {{version of}} events, {{the fight was}} in self-defense because the Cowboys, armed in {{violation}} of local ordinance, aggressively threatened the lawmen and defied a lawful order to hand over their weapons. The Cowboys <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> they raised their hands, offering no resistance, and were shot in cold blood by the Earps. Sorting out who {{was telling the truth}} was difficult and remains so.|$|E

50|$|Those {{scholars}} who maintain the Illyrian origin of Albanians <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> the indigenous Illyrian tribes dwelling in South Illyria went {{up into the}} mountains when Slavs occupied the lowlands, while another version of this hypothesis <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the Albanians are the descendants of Illyrian tribes located between Dalmatia and the Danube, who spilled south.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{contend that}} Sabina {{took over the}} {{contract}} on her father's job at Strasbourg after the master builder died {{and brought it to}} completion. Others <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> she merely assisted her father. Still others <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> Sabina completed the cathedral by herself, aided by [...] "magic," [...] when other stonemasons refused to work with her.|$|R
5|$|Activist groups {{interpreted}} {{his comments}} as warnings to President George W. Bush {{about the implications}} of nominating Supreme Court justices who were opposed to the Roe v. Wade decision. Specter <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> his comments were a prediction, not a warning. He met with many conservative Republican senators, and based on assurances he gave them, he was recommended for the Judiciary Committee's chairmanship in late 2004. He officially assumed that position when the 109th Congress convened on January 4, 2005.|$|E
5|$|After he {{posted a}} 3–2 {{record and a}} 5.45 ERA in seven starts, Hughes {{was moved to the}} bullpen when Wang {{returned}} to the rotation in early June. Hughes pitched well, becoming the primary setup man to Mariano Rivera in July due to injuries to Brian Bruney and Dámaso Marte. Despite his success as a reliever, Cashman <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> Hughes would be a starter over the long-term.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Evans {{moved the}} Klan's {{national}} headquarters to Washington, D.C., where {{the murder of}} Simmon's lawyer had received less publicity. To Evans' consternation, Stephenson also formed a women's auxiliary group. Evans and Stephenson subsequently exchanged allegations of sexual impropriety. Police charged Stephenson with the kidnapping, {{rape and murder of}} a young woman; he <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> the charges were orchestrated by Evans. After a sensational trial, Stephenson was convicted of second degree murder and given a life sentence; the publicity about the leader's behavior caused thousands of members to abandon the Klan.|$|E
