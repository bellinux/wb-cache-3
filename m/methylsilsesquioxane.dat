Electrical characterization using C-V and I-t measurements during bias temperature stress (BTS) were used to understand the effect of evaporated and sputtered Al on MSQ. The results show that MOSC with evaporated aluminium has lower breakdown voltage and has poor reliability as compared to structures with sputtered aluminium. The high temperature required for evaporation compared to sputtering process caused these, which cause defects at the aluminium/MSQ interface.

40|$|International audienceDespite their {{apparent}} simple preparation by sol-gel process, silsesquioxanes based {{materials are}} quite complex and rich systems. Accordingly, {{a clear understanding}} of their elaboration chemistry and its relations to process and properties are important matter. In the particular case of thin film preparation, vitrification must be controlled to ensure high throughput and reliability. Using <b>methylsilsesquioxane</b> based films as a relevant model and a combination of IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and solution 29 Si NMR, a meaningful description of the film structure was obtained. Furthermore, vitrification, observed by dynamic mechanical analysis, was shown to depend strongly on the amounts of cages and extended structures present in the films. More interestingly, the proportion of these species can be tuned through a careful control of the elaboration chemistry. On one hand, long aging and high dilution yield a larger amount of cages, which results in a delay of the vitrification. On the other hand, pH appears as the convenient parameter to finely adjust the time span during which high quality films can be prepared from the sols, while preserving the film composition and final properties...|$|E

The FTIR results showed that all chemistries reacted with silanol groups {{on the surface of}} the pores producing covalent Si-O-Si bonds. Self-condensation between the alkylsilanols with chain lengths above four carbon atoms produced a physisorbed residue, which was partially removed after rinsing with pure scCO 2. The hydrophobicity of the blanket p-MSQ surface was recovered, while the initial dielectric constant of 2. 4 for the blanket p-MSQ surface was restored after treatment. With an increase in the length of the alkyl chain, the contact angle increased from 84 ° to 108 ° and the dielectric constant measured on metal-insulator-semiconductor capacitors was approximately constant in the range 2. 4 ± 0. 05.

In the present study, we have systematically investigated {{the effects of the}} molecular structure of triblock copolymer-type nonionic surfactants PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO (PEO and PPO denote poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(propylene oxide) units, respectively) on the properties of the resultant MSQ aerogels. Macroscopic phase separation of hydrophobic MSQ networks from polar solvent occurs when no surfactant is employed, which results in macroporous opaque aerogels. In contrast, a co-presence of appropriate surfactant effectively suppresses the phase separation and yields transparent aerogels after supercritical drying. By employing various surfactants having different molecular weight and PO/EO ratio, the mechanism of suppression of phase separation or pore formation is discussed in detail. In situ 1 H NMR suggests that the PO units of surfactant interact with the hydrophobic MSQ network enriched with methyl groups and make the MSQ network hydrophilic by extending EO chains toward the aqueous solvent in the late phase of gelation, until which hydrogen bonding dominates between the Si-OH groups of polymerizing MSQ and the ether oxygens of the EO unit.

Obtaining a low-k dielectric value {{is critical for}} the IC industry in order to cope time delay and cross talking issues. These materials exhibit attractive dielectric value, but there are problems replacing conventional SiO 2, because of their chemical, mechanical and electrical instability after plasma processing. Several techniques have been suggested to mitigate process damage but supercritical silylation offers a rapid single repair step solution to this problem. Different ash and etch damaged samples were employed in this study to optimize an effective method to repair the low-k dielectric material and seal the surface pores via supercritical fluid processing with various trialkylchlorosilanes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contact angle, capacitance- voltage measurements, and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, dynamic secondary ion mass spectroscopy (DSIMS), characterized the films.

40|$|As {{compared}} to silicon oxide, porous low-k dielectric materials {{are more susceptible}} to molecular contaminants. As the device feature size decreases, control of molecular contaminants in porous low-k dielectric films and in UHP gas delivery systems becomes increasingly more challenging. Moisture was selected as the principal model contaminant in this research because the moisture impurity retained in the dielectric films not only increases the effective dielectric constant (k) value of the films but also degrades the reliability of the device. Dry-down of moisture contaminated UHP systems takes days to weeks, which significantly decreases the process throughput. In this research, the fundamental interaction mechanisms of moisture with spin-on porous <b>methylsilsesquioxane</b> (p-MSQ) and Black Diamond IIx (BDIIx) dielectric films were investigated through isothermal challenge-purge processes at different exposure environments. Mass spectrometers (APIMS and EIMS), and cavity ring-down spectroscopy were used to detect moisture concentration in the gas phase. The moisture concentration in the thin films was directly analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) micrographs were used to evaluate how patterning processes change the films. Moisture solubility, impact of temperature and gas flow rate on moisture removal, and dynamics of moisture uptake and removal in the films were determined by experimental study. Two process models were developed. The first one is capable of predicting the dynamic aspects of moisture adsorption and desorption in the films, and the second one is used to predict dry-down of moisture-contaminated gas delivery systems. The parameters in the models, such as moisture solubility and diffusivity in the films and rate constants of adsorption and desorption {{on the surface of the}} electro-polished stainless steel tube, were extracted through fitting these models to the experimental data. The models can be used to optimize key operating conditions such as purge temperature, purge gas purity, and purge gas flow rate. The models are also valuable tools for developing efficient contamination control strategies and process recipes for contamination removal in porous low-k dielectric films and for minimizing the gas usage in gas delivery systems...|$|E

Single molecule spectroscopy is used to probe the chemical interaction between single dye molecule and porous silica matrix. Bulk fluorescence spectroscopy is used to investigate the properties of gradient film. In Chapter one, the applications of single molecule spectroscopic methods to sol-gel silica materials are reviewed, which covers {{a subset of the}} recent literature in this area and provided salient examples of the new information that can be obtained by single molecule studies. In Chapter two, both the sample preparation and experiment setup are covered. In Chapter three, the {{preparation of}} mesoporous silica film is presented. Single molecule spectroscopy is used to probe the mass transport and molecule-matrix interactions in mesoporous thin-film systems. Three different dyes of varying size, charge, and hydrophilicity are used. Silica films with/without surfactant or containing different kind surfactant are studied. The results provide new information on mass transport through the films, evidence of reversible surface adsorption, and quantitative information on variations in these phenomena with film hydration.

40|$|Ultra low-k {{dielectric}} {{films are}} expected to widely replace SiO 2 as the interlayer dielectric for the next-generation microelectronic devices. A challenge facing the integration of these dielectrics in manufacturing is their interactions with gaseous contaminants, such as moisture and isopropanol, and the resulting change in their properties. Moisture retained in the film not only has detrimental effect on the k value of the film but also causes reliability and adhesion problems due to gradual outgassing. The physical and chemical interactions of moisture with porous spin-on and chemical vapor deposited (CVD) dielectrics are investigated using temperature- and concentration-programmed exposure and purge sequence together with trace moisture analysis, using atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry. The model compounds {{in this study are}} porous <b>Methylsilsesquioxane</b> and Black Diamond II films, deposited and treated under typical manufacturing conditions. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) studies showed that etching and ashing processes resulted in the formation of two layers, a damaged layer and non-damaged layer, which significantly changed moisture interaction properties. Moisture sorption and desorption studies showed that as compared to SiO 2 these films not only have a higher uptake capacity but also a slower and more activated moisture removal process. This could be a significant problem in successful integration of these films in IC manufacturing process. A process model was developed that provided information on the mechanism and kinetics of moisture uptake and release in thin porous films. The model elucidated the effect of film properties on the contamination uptake as well as outgassing. The model is a valuable tool for designing an optimum process for contamination control and removal in porous films. Another concern in IC manufacturing is the outgassing of impurities of electropolished stainless steel (EPSS) surfaces used in UHP gas distribution system. Moisture interaction with EPSS surface is studied in sub ppb range. A fundamental model was developed to study the mechanism and kinetics of moisture uptake and release from EPSS.

40|$|RC (resistance x capacitance) time {{constant}} delay, cross-talk noise, and power dissipation of the interconnect structure become limiting factors {{for the performance}} of integrated circuits (IC) as device feature sizes continue to scale down. To address these problems, copper has replaced aluminum for interconnects in leading edge microelectronic devices to satisfy the demand for better performance. Low-k and porous low-k dielectrics are introduced to further reduce the RC delay of interconnects and improve signal transmission. The conventional wet and dry processing approaches, however, face problems with highly porous structures and changes in dielectric constant k due to absorption of chemicals. Supercritical CO₂ (scCO₂) is especially useful for processing porous low-k films since it has solvating properties that are comparable to liquids but mass transfer characteristics comparable to gases and no surface tension. In this work, the removal of copper from silicon surface as well as viable processes for drying, repair and capping of porous <b>methylsilsesquioxane</b> (p-MSQ) films using precursors dissolved in scCO₂ were demonstrated. Copper was etched from a silicon surface using the chelator hexafluoroacetylacetone (hfacH) dissolved in scCO₂ at 40 - 60 °C and 100 - 250 atm. The Cu(II) shells were removed selectively to the Cu(I) ₂O cores by processing with pure scCO₂ and rapidly releasing the system pressure (300 atm/min). Mechanical failure of the Cu(II) O and Cu(II) Cl₂ when CO₂ in stress corrosion cracks quickly expanded delaminated these layers, leaving only Cu(I) ₂O on the surface. Etching of both Cu(II) and Cu(I) was achieved when oxidized samples were processed in scCO₂ containing approximately 120 ppm of hfacH for 2 min. The effect of adding 5 - 7 vol% cosolvents and 0. 5 - 1 vol% Si-bearing precursors to scCO₂ to dry, repair, and cap blanket ashed p-MSQ films (JSR LKD 5109) at 160 - 300 atm and 45 - 60 °C for a 2 min soak was investigated. The drying experimental results showed that all the aliphatic C 1 -C 6 alcohols and acetic acid removed H-bonded silanol (SiO-H) groups but that n-propanol and n-butanol were the most effective and had the lowest vapor pressure at 25 °C of the cosolvents studied. Repair and capping results showed that methylsilyl (–O-Si-CH₃) moieties were deposited on the surface by reaction with both isolated/geminal silanol (SiO-H) and H-bonded silanol (SiO-H) groups. As-received ashed p-MSQ had a contact angle of less than 10 ° and a dielectric constant of 3. 5 ± 0. 1. After processing in a mixture containing 7 % n-propanol and scCO₂, the contact angle was 15 ° and the dielectric constant decreased to 3. 2 ± 0. 1. The hydrophobicity of the p-MSQ film was recovered after Si-bearing precursors treatments as shown by contact angles > 80 °. The dielectric constant of ashed p-MSQ was completely or partially restored after treatments. The bi- or tri-functionality of the molecules with more reactive head groups produced intermolecular linking, and Ti chemical vapor deposition (CVD) showed that the pores of MSQ were capped after bi- or tri-functionality of the molecule processes...|$|E
