But she did not do it--perhaps from the inherent awkwardness of such a topic at this idle time. She confined herself simply to the above-mentioned business-like request, and when the party had walked a few steps together they separated, with <b>mutual</b> <b>promises</b> to meet again.|$|E
60|$|Sidney wished much to {{accompany}} him to the palace, if his presence could be any aid or protection, but on consideration {{it was decided that}} his being at the Louvre was likely to attract notice to Ribaumont's delaying there. The two young men therefore shook hands and parted, as youths who trusted that they had begun a lifelong friendship, with <b>mutual</b> <b>promises</b> to write to one another--the one, the adventures of his flight; the other, the astonishment it would excite.

50|$|A {{marriage}} {{proposal is}} an event where one person in a relationship asks for the other's hand in marriage. If accepted, it marks the initiation of engagement, a <b>mutual</b> <b>promise</b> of later marriage. It often has a ritual quality.|$|R
60|$|It was Lucy Ellen {{that had}} first {{proposed}} their <b>mutual</b> <b>promise,</b> but Cecily had grasped at it eagerly.

60|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>promises</b> were interchanged {{between him}} and his master, Stephen on his knees; the indentures were signed, for Quipsome Hal could with much ado produce an {{autograph}} signature, though his penmanship went no further, and the occasion was celebrated by a great dinner of the whole craft at the Armourers' Hall, to which the principal craftsmen who had been apprentices, such as Tibble Steelman and Kit Smallbones, were invited, sitting at a lower table, while the masters had the higher one on the dais, and a third was reserved for the apprentices after they should have waited on their masters--in fact it was an imitation of the orders of chivalry, knights, squires, and pages, and the gradation of rank was as strictly observed as by the nobility. Giles, considering the feast to be entirely in his honour, though the transfer of his indentures had been made at Salisbury, endeavoured to come out in some of his bravery, but was admonished that such presumption might be punished, the first time, at his master's discretion, the second time, by a whipping at the Hall of his Company, and the third time by six months being added to the term of his apprenticeship.|$|E
60|$|The {{enumeration}} of {{all these}} particulars--interrupted, as it constantly was, by unavailing lamentations {{on one side and}} by useless self-reproaches on the other--occupied much more time than either mother or son had imagined. It was not till the clock in Mr. Blyth's hall struck, that Mrs. Thorpe discovered how much longer her absence from home had lasted than she had intended it should on leaving Baregrove Square. She rose directly, in great trepidation--took a hurried leave of Valentine, who was loitering about his front garden--sent the kindest messages she could think of to the ladies above stairs--and departed at once for home. Zack escorted her to the entrance of the square; and, on taking leave, showed the sincerity of his contrition in a very unexpected and desperate manner, by actually offering to return home then and there with his mother, if she wished it! Mrs. Thorpe's heart yearned to take him at his word, but she remembered the doctor's orders and the critical condition of her husband's health; and forced herself to confess to Zack that the favorable time for his return had not yet arrived. After this--with <b>mutual</b> <b>promises</b> to communicate again soon through Valentine--they parted very sadly, just at the entrance of Baregrove Square: Mrs. Thorpe hurrying nervously to her own door, Zack returning gloomily to Mr. Blyth's house.|$|E
60|$|Some {{time after}} this, they came again {{to know if}} he had talked with me. He told them he had; that he found me not so averse to an {{accommodation}} as some of my friends were, who resented the disgrace offered me, and set me on; that they blowed the coals in secret, prompting me to revenge, or do myself justice, as they called it; so that he could not tell what to say to it; he told them he would do his endeavour to persuade me, but he {{ought to be able to}} tell me what proposal they made. They pretended they could not make any proposal, because it might be made use of against them; and he told them, that by the same rule he could not make any offers, for that might be pleaded in abatement of what damages a jury might be inclined to give. However, after some discourse and <b>mutual</b> <b>promises</b> that no advantage should be taken on either side, by what was transacted then or at any other of those meetings, they came to a kind of a treaty; but so remote, and so wide from one another, that nothing could be expected from it; for my attorney demanded #500 and charges, and they offered #50 without charges; so they broke off, and the mercer proposed to have a meeting with me myself; and my attorney agreed to that very readily.|$|E

50|$|The {{reasoning}} {{is that a}} party should not be held to a contract {{that they were not}} even aware existed. A <b>mutual</b> <b>promise</b> between friends over simple personal matters should not be a situation where legal remedies are to be used.

60|$|The {{palace of}} Lord Montfort {{was in the}} most {{distinguished}} quarter of the city, and situate {{in the midst of}} vast gardens full of walls of laurel, arches of ilex, and fountains of lions. They arrived at twilight, and the shadowy hour lent even additional space to the huge halls and galleries. Yet in the suite of rooms intended for Mr. Temple and his daughter, every source of comfort seemed to have been collected. The marble floors were covered with Indian mats and carpets, the windows were well secured from the air which might have proved fatal to an invalid, while every species of chair and couch, and sofa, courted the languid or capricious form of Miss Temple, and she was even favoured with an English stove, and guarded by an Indian screen. The apartments were supplied with every book which it could have been supposed might amuse her; there were guitars of the city and of Florence, and even an English piano; a library of the choicest music; and all the materials of art. The air of elegance and cheerful comfort that pervaded these apartments, so unusual in this land, the bright blaze of the fire, evert the pleasant wax-lights, all combined to deprive the moment of that feeling of gloom and exhaustion which attends an arrival at a strange place at a late hour, and Henrietta looked around her, and almost fancied she was once more at Ducie. Lord Montfort introduced his fellow-travellers to their apartments, presented to them the servant who was to assume the management of their little household, and then reminding them of their <b>mutual</b> <b>promises</b> that they were to be entirely their own masters, and not trouble themselves about him any more than if they were at Pisa, he shook them both by the hand, and bade them good-night.|$|E

50|$|Agni and yajna play {{a central}} role in Hindu weddings.

The wedding ritual of Panigrahana, for example, is the 'holding the hand' ritual as a symbol of their impending marital union, and the groom announcing his acceptance of responsibility to four deities: Bhaga signifying wealth, Aryama signifying heavens/milky way, Savita signifying radiance/new beginning, and Purandhi signifying wisdom. The groom faces west, while the bride sits in front of him with her face to the east, he holds her hand while the Rig vedic mantra is recited in the presence of fire.|$|E

5000|$|In its {{traditional}} form, consideration is expressed as {{the requirement that}} in order for parties to be able to enforce a promise, they must have given something for it (quid pro quo): something must be given or promised in exchange or return for the promise. A contract must be [...] "met with" [...] or [...] "supported by" [...] consideration to be enforceable; also, only a person who has provided consideration can enforce a contract. In other words, if an arrangement consists of a promise which is not supported by consideration, then the arrangement is not a legally enforceable contract. <b>Mutual</b> <b>promises</b> constitute consideration for each other.

50|$|The {{discovery}} of gold around Pierce and Orofino in 1861 drew thousands of prospectors into the Clearwater River area of present-day north central Idaho, east of Lewiston. With {{all the best}} ground claimed, many newcomers began to look elsewhere.In late summer 1861, a party of men headed south toward a local divide between the Clearwater River drainage and the Salmon River watershed. At that time, much of that area was still part of the Nez Perce Indian Reservation. (A new treaty in June 1863 reset the reservation boundary.) Perhaps because of Indian protests, the party split at some point. A smaller band of five {{made their way into}} a high mountain basin about thirty miles (50 km) south of today's Grangeville. There, they found very rich placer gold along most of the nearby streams in August 1861. Despite <b>mutual</b> <b>promises</b> to keep the find quiet when they returned to Elk City for supplies, word quickly got out.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, The Vanguard Press {{issued the}} L'Engle novel Prelude (LC 68-56600). The indicia page notes the book's provenance: [...] "This {{book has been}} {{especially}} adapted for young people by the author from {{the first part of}} her novel, The Small Rain." [...] Dedicated to L'Engle's father, Charles Wadsworth Camp (as is The Small Rain), Prelude covers the events of Katherine's life until Justin leaves the boarding school. The ending of Prelude is slightly more upbeat than the corresponding text in The Small Rain, with <b>mutual</b> <b>promises</b> that they will see each other again. By contrast, the same scene in The Small Rain ends with the words, [...] "She...sat there until she saw Justin leave the studio, carrying the music he hadn't already packed, walking happily, he head held high and proud, out of her life." [...] Another major difference is that Prelude omits Justin's drunken advances toward the still-underage Katherine in Paris, shortly before she returns to school without him. The scene in which Miss Valentine interrogates Katherine and Sarah about their friendship (which does not directly mention homosexuality) is left intact.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} team {{formation}} {{can serve as}} an implicit commitment device to overcome problems of self-control. In a situation where individuals have present-biased preferences, any effort that is costly today but rewarded at some later point in time is too low {{from the perspective of}} an individual's long-run self. If agents interact repeatedly and can monitor each other, a relational contract involving teamwork can help to improve an agent's performance. The <b>mutual</b> <b>promise</b> to work harder is credible because the team breaks up after an agent has not kept this promise - which leads to individual (under-) production in the future and reduces an agent's future utility. This holds even though the standard free-rider problem is present and teamwork renders no technological benefits. Moreover, we show that even if teamwork does render technological benefits, the performance of a team of present-biased agents can actually be better than the performance of a team of time-consistent agents...|$|R
60|$|Previously to {{separating}} from my {{new friend}} Dr. Reasono, however, I took him aside, {{and stated that}} I had an acquaintance in the hotel, a person of singular philosophy, after the human fashion, and a great traveller; and that I desired permission to let him into the secret of our intended lecture on the monikin economy, and to bring him with me as an auditor. To this request, No. 22,817, brown-study color, or Dr. Reasono, gave a very cordial assent; hinting delicately, at the same time, his expectation that this new auditor, who, of course, was no other than Captain Noah Poke, would not deem it disparaging to his manhood, to consult the sensibilities of the ladies, by appearing in the garments of that only decent and respectable tailor and draper, nature.

50|$|Violation by {{the host}} of the duties of {{hospitality}} was likely to provoke the wrath of the gods; but it does not appear that anything beyond this religious sanction existed to guard the rights of a traveler. Similar customs seem to have existed among the Italian peoples. Amongst the Romans, private hospitality, which had existed from the earliest times, was more accurately and legally defined than amongst the Greeks, the tie between host and guest being almost as strong as that between patron and client. It was of the nature of a contract, entered into by <b>mutual</b> <b>promise,</b> the clasping of hands, and exchange of an agreement in writing (tabula hospitalis) or of a token (tessera or symbolum), and was rendered hereditary by the division of the tessera. The advantages thus obtained by the guest were, the right of hospitality when traveling and, above all, the protection of his host (representing him as his patron) in a court of law. The contract was sacred and inviolable, undertaken in the name of Jupiter Hospitalis, and could only be dissolved by a formal act.|$|R
5000|$|Consideration in English law {{is one of}} {{the four}} main {{building}} blocks of a contract. Consideration can be anything of value (such as an item or service), which each party to a legally binding contract must agree to exchange if the contract is to be valid. If only one party offers consideration, the agreement is not legally a binding contract. In its traditional form, expressed as the requirement that in order for parties to be able to enforce a promise, they must have given something for it (quid pro quo): something must be given or promised in exchange or return for the promise. A contract must be [...] "met with" [...] or [...] "supported by" [...] consideration to be enforceable; also, only a person who has provided consideration can enforce a contract.

Regarding the Bacchanalia, it was resolved to give the following directions to those who are in alliance with us: No one of them is to possess a place where the festivals of Bacchus are celebrated; if there are any who claim that it is necessary for them to have such a place, they are to come to Rome to the praetor urbanus, and the senate is to decide on those matters, when their claims have been heard, provided that not less than 100 senators are present when the affair is discussed. No man is to be a Bacchantian, neither a Roman citizen, nor one of the Latin name, nor any of our allies unless they come to the praetor urbanus, and he in accordance with the opinion of the senate expressed when not less than 100 senators are present at the discussion, shall have given leave.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{consider}} {{the structure and}} procedures of the English law courts of the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean periods, with reference to three of Shakespeare's plays: The Merchant of Venice, Measure for Measure and The Winter's Tale. These plays, while not replicating in realistic detail the juridical processes of the early modern legal system, provide an imaginary, hybrid version of immanent institutional configurations in English jurisprudence. Through the dramatic device of the trial scene, Shakespeare offers an informed critique of existing practices and ideologies in three distinct but related areas of law. The trial scene in The Merchant of Venice, {{far from being the}} paean to Equity that many commentators have described, engages both with the elevation of conscience in late Elizabethan contract law and the symbolically-charged <b>mutual</b> <b>promise</b> in commercial arrangements. The offstage trial of Claudio in Measure for Measure and the spectacular trial scene {{at the end of the}} play raise highly topical issues of the relevance of religious belief to the initiation and resolution of the criminal trial. Finally, the trial for adultery and High Treason of Hermione in The Winter's Tale raises significant constitutional issues concerning the imposition of the King's Imperium and the subsequent diminution in the jurisdictional power of the courts of common law. Drawing these themes together is the burgeoning matter of the institutional relationship between the autonomous subject of law and an increasingly centralised, expansive state...|$|R

40|$|Although studies {{reveal that}} {{acquiring}} knowledge {{about a new}} workplace during organizational socialization leads to better integration, the pathway through which this occurs is not well understood. Previous research has explored the psychological contract as an outcome of socialization. This study explores its role within the socialization process. A total of 161 organizational newcomers undertook surveys at months one and three of tenure, with data used to test a model within which four psychological contract dimensions mediate the relationship between knowledge acquisition and employee outcomes. At month one, organizational and employee promise strength mediated the relationship between knowledge and outcomes. At month three, organizational and employee promise fulfilment mediated this relationship. Findings confirm {{the role of the}} psychological contract in the socialization process and suggest that effective integration requires extensive knowledge provision and active employee knowledge acquisition.
