However, the director states that more needs to be done to conserve the site, especially its fragile murals, and to balance the needs of tourists against the need to conserve the site in general. Each year since 1992, the number of visitors to the site increases which now stands at 653,000 annually.|$|E
25|$|The {{rebuilding}} of the exterior in 1882–1883 (south elevation) and 1896 (east elevation), {{prompted by the}} demolition of buildings adjacent to {{the south side of}} the chapel to allow North Street to be widened, involved replacing the stucco with red brick, enlarging the pediment and giving the new south elevation a similar appearance. It is neither as tall nor as long as the east side (facing Prince's Place), and has no pediment, but was otherwise very similar until the alterations of 1995 changed the entrance area and added more glass to <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the interior visible from the street. The most significant feature of Arthur Blomfield's work on the exterior was the tall, red-brick clock tower. This has some flintwork and a hipped slate roof. The tower has four clock faces, each in a terracotta insert.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, {{three years}} after his {{departure}} and one hour after he left, the Doctor returned to the Greenpeace rally. With Sam collected, the pair spent a great period wandering together, facing dozens of adventures. During their travels, Sam and the Doctor became aware of a great War, looming {{in the future of}} Gallifrey – a war between the Time Lords and an as-yet-unidentified Enemy, with dramatic and disturbing consequences. While exploring the subject, the Doctor discovered that his Sam was not the original Samantha Jones; rather, her biodata had been manipulated by an outside agency with the intent to mould her into a prosaic distraction for him (Alien Bodies). Ultimately this plan proved a failure, as Sam developed into a much more strongly-willed companion than intended; at one point she spent three years avoiding the Doctor, so as to cope with a crush she had developed on him, but managed to survive and make a good life for herself in the future until she rejoined the Doctor as she could <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a difference with him.|$|E
500|$|House of Pain spent 10 days {{working on}} [...] "Gangstas iz Genocide". Alba {{digitally}} photographed images of buildings near the Marcy Houses in Brooklyn, New York.

The artists also improvised {{the use of a}} hand grenade. When Lee saw how violent the sequence was, he improvised the line [...] "Kill Dat Nigga!" [...] as a subtitle. The entire sequence was rendered out to play onscreen in full frame. The original running time of the animated sequence was 60 seconds. Lee cut it to 30 seconds, feeling that a shorter length would <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an impact. Upon Inside Mans theatrical release, he regretted the video game sequence in the film, saying, [...] "The sad thing is somebody is probably gonna make a game out of it and take that as inspiration." ...|$|E

He was {{named in the}} first-team squad for the 2000–01 season, when Northampton were in the Second Division {{following}} their promotion. He made his debut {{at the age of}} 17 as a half-time substitute in a 2–0 home defeat to Port Vale on 26 April 2001 and his first start came in a 3–0 home defeat to Walsall on 5 May, finishing the season with three appearances. He signed his first professional contract with the club on 9 April 2002. He scored his first goal for the club with a [...] "spectacular" [...] long-range volley on 84 minutes in a 4–1 win against Wycombe Wanderers. This season, 2001–02, Carruthers was able to <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an impact, playing in 14 matches and scoring 1 goal. He received the first yellow card of his career in a 2–2 away draw with Cambridge United in the FA Cup second round on 7 December 2002.

500|$|In June 2015, it was {{revealed}} that the season would include the Secret Warriors team by introducing Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name. The episode [...] "Emancipation" [...] is set in the aftermath of Civil War, and deals with how the Secret Warriors and other Inhumans are affected by the Sokovia Accords, with some members of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team feeling [...] "Inhumans should be registered and [...] who feel that's a first step to them being sequestered, imprisoned, exterminated." [...] Wen noted that [...] "The connection is there, but it’s also very tenuous at this point, because S.H.I.E.L.D. has become so isolated with what’s going on with the Avengers and them not knowing still that Coulson is alive." [...] On how the themes of Civil War allowed the series to <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a philosophical tie-in than with previous films, Whedon stated that [...] "we do have people across the globe who have powers on our show and there would be varying reactions to that. A lot of fear, some excitement, some people wanting to use it for good, some people wanting to use it for evil. So, a lot of those same themes [...] will be addressed on our show." [...] Bennet added, [...] "we've been dealing with the bigger issues of Civil War on a smaller, more personal scale for a while now. It's been building.

500|$|Bill Shankly began {{managing}} Liverpool in 1959, and it {{was under}} him that the team first competed in European competition in 1964–65, qualifying for the European Cup by winning the First Division championship the previous season. The club's first opponents were Knattspyrnufélag Reykjavíkur of Iceland, who they played in the preliminary round. Liverpool won 11–1 on aggregate. The next round, against Belgian club Anderlecht, {{was the first time}} in Liverpool's history that they wore their now common all-red strip. The decision was made to change from red shirts, white shorts and socks by Shankly, who wanted his players to <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a psychological impact on opponents. They beat Anderlecht and progressed to the semi-finals, where they met Italian team Internazionale. Before the first leg at Anfield, Shankly asked two injured players to parade the FA Cup, which Liverpool had won the previous week, to intimidate the Italians. The team won the match 3–1, but Inter won the second leg 3–0, securing a 4–3 aggregate victory. The second leg was controversial; Shankly described it as [...] "a war". He felt that the referee, Jose Maria Ortiz de Mendibel, had shown bias towards Internazionale, and the Liverpool players felt cheated by his decisions. The club's 1964–65 FA Cup victory ensured qualification for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup the following season, and in that competition, they reached their first European final. Borussia Dortmund, Liverpool's opponents, employed counter-attacking tactics that had paid dividends in previous rounds and did so again, with the West Germans beating Liverpool 2–1 after extra time.|$|E

500|$|Construction began of {{defensive}} positions along the Dnieper, but Hitler refused requests to pull back, insisting that Kharkov be held. With reinforcements trickling in, Manstein waged {{a series of}} counterattacks and armoured battles near Bohodukhiv and Okhtyrka between 13 and 17 August, which resulted in heavy casualties as they ran into prepared Soviet lines. On 20 August he informed the OKH that his forces in the Donets river area were holding a too-wide front with insufficient numbers, and {{that he needed to}} either withdraw to the Dnieper River or receive reinforcements. Continuous pressure from the Soviet forces had separated Army Group Centre from Army Group South and severely threatened Manstein's northern flank. When the Red Army threw their main reserves behind a drive to retake Kharkov on 21–22 August, Manstein took advantage of this to close the gap between the 4th Panzer and 8th Armies and reestablish a defensive line. Hitler finally allowed Manstein to withdraw back across the Dnieper on 15 September. During the withdrawal, Manstein ordered scorched earth actions to be taken in a zone [...] from the river, and later faced charges at his war crimes trial for issuing this order. Soviet losses in July and August included over 1.6 million casualties, 10,000 tanks and self-propelled artillery pieces, and 4,200 aircraft. German losses, while only one-tenth that of the Soviet losses, were much more difficult to sustain, as there were no further reserves of men and materiel to draw on. In a series of four meetings that September, Manstein tried unsuccessfully to convince Hitler to reorganise the high command and let his generals <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the military decisions.|$|E
