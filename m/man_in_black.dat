5|$|In {{order to}} stop the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> from leaving the island, Richard {{suggests}} that they destroy the Ajira plane. After Ilana is killed while holding dynamites, Frank goes to the Black Rock with the group {{in order to get}} more dynamite. However, Hurley blows up the ship in order to prevent anymore risks; destroying all the dynamite supplies. After Hurley tells of his plan to talk to the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> and Richard goes with his plan to destroy the plane, Frank joins Hurley, along with Jack, and Sun.

Sayid sacrifices himself and runs off with the C4 {{as far away from}} the others as he could until it explodes. The {{explosion}} causes the submarine to sink, and Frank is knocked out after a door hits him. Frank revives and makes it {{to the surface of the}} water. He is found by Richard and Miles as they head for Hydra Island to blow up the Ajira plane. Frank convinces them to steal the plane and let him fly it. After much repair work and picking up Kate, Claire, and Sawyer, the plane takes off and heads for home.|$|E

The series was developed to capitalise on the popularity of The X-Files and Mission: Impossible. The influence of The X-Files in particular {{can be seen in}} the subject of government conspiracies and the involvement of mysterious <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>black.</b> The <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> Light very closely resemble the <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> that act as hosts of the similarly X-Files-inspired Vector 13.|$|R

[...] Another central figure in a UFO legend, Albert Bender supposedly was silenced by menacing <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> <b>in</b> 1953 because he had discovered the answer to the UFO mystery. Bender maintained that the <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> were secret government agents tasked with suppressing evidence of UFOs. The ufologist John Keel {{claimed to have}} had encounters with <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> and referred to them as [...] "demonic supernaturals" [...] with [...] "dark skin and/or “exotic” facial features". According to the ufologist Jerome Clark, reports of <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> represent [...] "experiences" [...] that [...] "don’t seem to have occurred in the world of consensus reality".|$|R

25|$|In {{popular culture}} and UFO {{conspiracy}} theories, <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> (MIB) are supposed <b>men</b> dressed <b>in</b> <b>black</b> suits who claim to be government agents who harass or threaten UFO witnesses to keep them quiet about what they have seen. It is sometimes implied {{that they may be}} aliens themselves. The term is also frequently used to describe mysterious men working for unknown organizations, as well as various branches of government allegedly designed to protect secrets or perform other strange activities. The term is generic, used for any unusual, threatening or strangely behaved individual whose appearance on the scene can be linked in some fashion with a UFO sighting. Several alleged encounters with the <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> have been reported by UFO researchers and enthusiasts.|$|R

When they get there Miles hears the screams of Ben's daughter Alex, buried there. They get the C4 but when they come out they are confronted by Widmore and his geologist Zoe. Widmore says he needs a hiding place because the monster was coming. Ben reluctantly says he can hide in his secret room. When The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> comes Richard says he can talk to it, claiming all he wants is for Richard to join him. Ben goes with him but Miles; saying he is sticking to surviving, decides to leave them and run back into the jungle.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} {{a vision of the}} player's {{character}} wielding a blade of light to strike down a masked <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> robes. The vision is a dream the player has while on a carriage ride to their chosen starting city—Gridania, Ul'dah, or Limsa Lominsa. Players returning from the original release appear in a forest in a pillar of light—Louisoix's final spell to save their lives from the devastation at Carteneau. Through undertaking various odd jobs, the player character ingratiates him or herself with the local Adventurer's Guild and earns comparisons with the fabled Warriors of Light, brave adventurers who participated in the Battle of Carteneau whose identities have been mysteriously erased from the memories of all who knew them. A pattern emerges amid these quests involving a series of attacks by masked men, as well {{as a member of the}} Scions of the Seventh Dawn who claims to know the origin of the player's visions. The adventurer meets the leader of this secret society, Minfilia, who reveals that the visions are a manifestation of the Echo and mark the player as a chosen representative of Hydaelyn, the Mothercrystal.|$|E
25|$|Inside the {{pedestal}} of the statue, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black,</b> {{who has taken}} the form of Locke, sends Ben to get Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell). Richard, however, refuses to go inside and instead shows Locke's body to Ben. Bram (Brad William Henke) and his team from Flight 316 enter the statue with Ben. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> transforms into the Smoke Monster and easily kills Bram and his men, but spares Ben. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> then tells Ben what Locke's final thoughts were, and explains that his own true goal is to return home. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> finds this ironic because Locke wanted desperately to stay and live on the island. Outside, Richard sees the fireworks from the temple. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> then confronts Richard, who realizes who the man is, but the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> quickly knocks him out and announces that he is disappointed in the Others as he carries Richard into the jungle.|$|E

25|$|On {{the way to}} {{the heart}} of the Island, Jack's group {{encounters}} the Man in Black's group. Jack tells the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> that he is going to kill him, and together with Desmond, they travel {{to the heart of the}} Island. Jack believes that Desmond can kill the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> because he thinks Jacob brought him back not as bait but as a weapon. Desmond tells Jack that destroying the island and killing the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> do not matter because he is going down to the heart of the island and leaving for another place. Jack and the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> lower Desmond down to the heart of the island and he reaches a chamber, leading to a glowing pool with an elongated stone at its center. Immune to the pool's electromagnetic energy, Desmond manages to remove the giant stone stopper in the center of the pool. However, the light goes out and the pool dries up, setting about the destruction of the island which the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> predicted. A result of Desmond's act is an unforeseen side-effect of making the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> mortal again. During a prolonged fight, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> stabs Jack in the same spot where his appendix was taken out and almost kills him when Kate shoots the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> in the back, allowing Jack to kick him off the cliff to his death. The island continues to crumble and Jack realizes that he has to restore the light of the heart of the Island. He tells Kate to get Claire Littleton (Emilie De Ravin) on the plane and leave the island in case he fails. The two profess their love for each other and Kate leaves with Sawyer while Hurley and Ben follow Jack back to the pool.|$|E
