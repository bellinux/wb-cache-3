5|$|Because {{language}} {{emerged in}} the early prehistory of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and {{it is believed that}} no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like.</b> And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.|$|E

A flint arrowhead found nearby, {{and the lack of}} querns for grinding cereals, hint at some dependency on goods from outside the area (flint is not local to Dartmoor).

James' autobiographical Beyond a Boundary, the Trinidadian writer {{writes about}} his visits {{as a young}} man to his friend Learie Constantine, at that time living in Nelson while playing as a {{professional}} for the town Lancashire League team. He gives a vivid sense of what it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> for a young West Indian to arrive in the wet and strange East Lancashire. He also describes how his subsequent education at university in Paris is helped by a local baker, and how his gradual politicisation is given a boost by meetings with local socialists, concerned with the harsh treatment and conditions suffered by the local working class millworkers. Although an extreme example, the meetings between other professional cricketers from the British Empire, and the mainly working-class amateurs of the Lancashire League, must have resulted in many other instances of mutual support and understanding.|$|E

500|$|This {{method of}} {{recording}} caused conflicts to arise. Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote of Spector's obsessive techniques: [...] "Phil {{would sit in}} the control room and would listen through the headphones to Marky hit one note on the drum, hour after hour, after hour, after hour." [...] During the recording of [...] "Rock 'n' Roll High School", Johnny was forced by Spector to repeat his part hundreds of times {{over the course of several}} hours. Sire Records owner Seymour Stein relates: [...] "To Johnny, this <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> the Chinese water torture." [...] "I understood [...] attitude," [...] said Marky. [...] "He was from The Bronx, I was from Brooklyn. We got along very well and had a nice rapport… But he had his way of working that was very slow, and the Ramones had their way of working which was very fast. So that would sometimes irk everybody, and led to animosity with Johnny and Dee Dee." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} the {{inspiration}} for the film, saying: [...] "I have always loved cars. In one vein, I have Disney blood, and in the other, there's motor oil. The notion of combining these two great passions in my life—cars and animation—was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis." ...|$|E

[...] He was {{impressed}} with the [...] "lively and fascinating sense of local culture" [...] that dominated the film. Kline, who gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, was mainly concerned with the film's [...] "rather clumsy" [...] direction and screenwriting. Maseko directed with [...] "energy and verve," [...] though his [...] "struggles to capture the human drama" [...] led to the impression that Drum was [...] "a clunky TV movie, with awkward camera angles, wonky editing and clumsy sound recording." [...] Filardi was guilty of a dialogue which [...] "echoes with cliches, while contrived plotting put characters into situations that may be true, but they feel corny and movie-like." [...] Kline also criticised the wide variety of political issues that characterised the film, though added that [...] "maybe this helps us begin to understand what life <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> under such an oppressive government." ...|$|E

2500|$|Author Anthony Trollope, who {{travelled}} {{extensively in}} Australia in the 1870s and wrote about each State, said that rich landowners of Victoria erect European country houses [...] "with {{the addition of}} a wide verandah". Glenormiston was one of the homesteads where life at the time continued [...] "not only pleasantly, but ... with grace." [...] Trollope's observation was that at this time, life in the Western District <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> [...] "English country life in the eighteenth century" [...] when the roads were bad, there was great plenty but not luxury, the men were fond of sport, the women stayed at home and looking after the house was done by the mistress and her daughters or the master and his sons rather than by domestics or servants as in England at the time. Trollope commented that [...] "horses are cheap and servants are dear in Victoria." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{question}} that melodies repeated in each strophe, in the modern manner, were not sung at either the earlier or the later periods of psalm-singing; since no such thing as regular strophes occurred in Hebrew poetry. In fact, in the earlier times there were no strophes at all; and although they are found later, they are by no means so regular as in modern poetry. Melody, therefore, must then have had comparatively great freedom and elasticity and <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> the Oriental melody of today. As Niebuhr points out, the melodies are earnest and simple, and the singers must make every word intelligible. A comparison has often been made with the eight notes of the Gregorian chant or with the Oriental psalmody introduced into the church of Milan by Ambrosius: the latter, however, was certainly developed under the influence of Grecian music, although in origin it may have had some connection with the ancient synagogal psalm-singing, as Delitzsch claims that it was ("Psalmen," [...] 3d ed., p.27).|$|E

2500|$|Tatiana {{did have}} her {{concerns}} about the storyline. She {{did not want the}} show to do a gay stereotype. Riegel voiced the same concerns earlier on about the character; she clarified that she asked the show's writers and producers to make the character three-dimensional and not [...] "so heavily centered" [...] on the character's sexual orientation. Having grown up close to an out lesbian sister, who [...] "came out" [...] in her early 20s, Riegel was familiar with how Bianca should be if stereotypes were to be avoided. At the time of Tatiana's [...] "coming-out" [...] process, Riegel and brother Sam were children. Tatiana relayed that being gay was not an issue and that she could not remember having had a conversation with them about it at that age. By the time Riegel and Sam were old enough to know what being gay meant, they had grown to love Tatiana's girlfriend and the family was closer than before. Riegel having acquired the role of Bianca led her and Tatiana to discuss certain specifics of the character. Riegel's mindset was centered on what it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> for Tatiana to grow up as gay. She said that she had never heard Tatiana's whole coming-out story before and that it was nice to talk about.|$|E
2500|$|The Braves {{returned}} to Atlanta, and on April 8, 1974, {{a crowd of}} 53,775 people showed up for the game—a Braves attendance record. The game was also broadcast nationally on NBC. In the fourth inning, Aaron hit home run number 715 off Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Al Downing. Although Dodgers outfielder Bill Buckner nearly went over the outfield wall trying to catch it, the ball landed in the Braves' bullpen, where relief pitcher Tom House caught it. While cannons were fired in celebration, two college students [...] sprinted onto the field and jogged alongside Aaron for part of his circuit around the bases, temporarily startling him. A very youthful Craig Sager actually interviewed Aaron between third and home for a television station, WXLT (now WWSB-Channel 40) in Sarasota. As the fans cheered wildly, Aaron's parents ran onto the field as well. Braves announcer Milo Hamilton, calling the game on WSB radio, described the scene as Aaron broke the record: [...] "Henry Aaron, {{in the second inning}} walked and scored. He's sittin' on 714. Here's the pitch by Downing. Swinging. There's a drive into left-center field. That ball is gonna be-eee... Outta here! It's gone! It's 715! There's a new home run champion of all time, and it's Henry Aaron! The fireworks are going. Henry Aaron is coming around third. His teammates are at home plate. And listen to this crowd!" [...] Meanwhile, Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully addressed the racial tension— or apparent lack thereof— in his call of the home run: [...] "What a marvelous moment for baseball; what a marvelous moment for Atlanta and the state of Georgia; what a marvelous moment for the country and the world. A black man is getting a standing ovation in the Deep South for breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol. And it is a great moment for all of us, and particularly for Henry Aaron. ...And {{for the first time in}} a long time, that poker face in Aaron shows the tremendous strain and relief of what it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> to live with for the past several months." [...] On October 2, 1974, Aaron hit his 733rd and final home run as a Braves player. Thirty days later, after Aaron decided not to retire, the Braves traded him to the Milwaukee Brewers for Roger Alexander and Dave May. The trade re-united Aaron with former teammate Del Crandall, who was now managing the Brewers. On May 1, 1975, Aaron broke baseball's all-time RBI record, previously held by Ruth with 2,213. That year, he also played in his last and 24th All-Star Game (25th All-Star Game selection); he lined out to Dave Concepción as a pinch-hitter in the second inning. This All-Star Game, like the first one he played in 1955, was before a home crowd at Milwaukee County Stadium.|$|E
