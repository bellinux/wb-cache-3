But financial globalization {{can also lead to}} large benefits, particularly {{to the development of the}} financial system. The net effect of financial globalization is likely positive, with risks being <b>more</b> prevalent <b>right</b> <b>after</b> countries liberalize. In the long run, large potential gains are expected. So far, only some countries, sectors, and firms have taken advantage of globalization. As financial systems turn global, governments lose policy instruments, so there is an increasing need for international financial policy coordination...|$|R

Teoretical introduction is dedicated to analysing possible neurophysiological mechanisms which could be applied in rehabilitation with using of Kinect such as biofeedback, repetitive movements, complex paterns of movements. Training response was tested on the pilote sample of two patients: one with right-handed spastic hemiparesis after hemorragic stroke, the other with kvadruparesis, disability of low to medium-size of both superior limbs, <b>more</b> severe <b>right,</b> <b>after</b> craniocerebral trauma with multiple contuses of brain. Training was applied in series of six training days during several weeks.

He came out {{aggressive}} {{in the second round}} and forced Musashi to the ropes before landing an illegal blow to the groin area of Musashi. The referee stopped the fight at that point when Musashi's corner threw in the towel because they originally felt like their fighter could no longer continue. Wang walked out of the ring eventually, and went to the back after he was given the victory. However, in an even more bazar turn of events, the initial throwing in of the towel was discounted and they decided that the fight between Musashi and Wan Qiang should continue. Therefore, taking away the announcement that Wang was victorious. At this point Wang was already in the back and out of the ring, and when he found out about the overturned decision, decided not to come back out and fight, and so they gave Musashi the victory, which gave him the right to fight Fujimoto in the final round. As if the night could not get any <b>more</b> interesting, <b>right</b> <b>after</b> Musashi was given the victory he was determined to be unfit to fight (condition wise, because of the inadvertent blow) and Wang Qiang who had won, and then lost, and now seemingly won again, got the chance to fight Fujimoto in the finals.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It {{remains unknown}} whether {{and when the}} hosting of mega-sport events {{increases}} {{quality of life of}} host city residents. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the changes in quality of life of host city residents over the course of hosting a mega-sport event until three months after the event, depending on residents’ perception of the atmosphere during the event. Methods The study was conducted in Rio de Janeiro, one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in soccer. Participants were recruited from a Brazilian market research agency’s panel and surveyed online. The WHOQOL-BREF was used to measure quality of life of residents of Rio de Janeiro (n[*]=[*] 281) in three waves in the context of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Perceived atmosphere at the event was measured via an established scale. Piecewise latent growth models were used to analyze individual changes in the four domains of quality of life per se and depending on perceived atmosphere. Results There was no change in quality of life with respect to physical, social, psychological, and environmental health for all participants during the course of the event. However, residents who perceived a positive atmosphere rated the social and environmental domains of quality of life <b>more</b> positively <b>right</b> <b>after</b> the end (vs. at the beginning) of the World Cup. This increase sustained until three months after the event. Physical health (particularly at high levels of perceived atmosphere) and psychological health decreased from <b>right</b> <b>after</b> the event until three months after. Conclusions There was no positive effect of the hosting of the mega-sport event on the four quality of life domains of the panel members (who were residents of a city hosting a mega-sport event) per se. The individual changes in quality of life vary by perception of atmosphere and by domain of quality of life...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{reviewed}} the cases of vascular crossed aphasia reported in the literature, in order to check whether deep lesions are really overrepresented in crossed aphasia with respect to standard aphasia. The comparison with a large sample of standard left-hemisphere-damaged aphasics revealed a significantly higher incidence of purely deep lesions in crossed aphasics than in standard aphasics. The overrepresentation of deep lesions in crossed aphasia appears to be contingent on the co-occurrence of aphasia and Unilateral Neglect after right-hemisphere lesion. This suggests an interaction between language and attentional mechanisms in the case of reversed language lateralisation: the overcrowding of these functions in the right hemisphere could make language <b>more</b> vulnerable <b>after</b> <b>right</b> deep lesions...|$|R
40|$|A largely {{substantiated}} view in {{the domain}} of working memory is that the maintenance of serial order is achieved by generating associations of each item with an independent representation of its position, so-called position markers. Recent studies reported that the ordinal position of an item in verbal working memory interacts with spatial processing. This suggests that position markers might be spatial in nature. However, these interactions were so far observed in tasks implying a clear binary categorization of space (i. e., with left and right responses or targets). Such binary categorizations leave room for alternative interpretations, such as congruency between non-spatial categorical codes for ordinal position (e. g., begin and end) and spatial categorical codes for response (e. g., left and right). Here we discard this interpretation by providing evidence that this interaction can also be observed in a task that draws upon a continuous processing of space, the line bisection task. Specifically, bisections are modulated by ordinal position in verbal working memory, with lines bisected <b>more</b> towards the <b>right</b> <b>after</b> retrieving items from the end compared {{to the beginning of the}} memorized sequence. This supports the idea that position markers are intrinsically spatial in nature...|$|R

He took command of the Vlaamse Militanten Orde (VMO) in the 1971 after it had been disbanded by founder Bob Maes and turned it towards a <b>more</b> extreme <b>right</b> path. <b>After</b> the VMO was outlawed in 1984 he became {{associated}} with the Vlaams Blok, {{as well as the}} Odal Group, which presented itself as the successor to the VMO. As VMO leader Eriksson had been brought to trial in 1981 on charges of leading a private army but, although initially found guilty, he was acquitted by the Antwerp court of appeal in June 1982. The VMO itself continued in defiance of the ban although Eriksson's leadership came to an end in 1985 when Jan Eggermont took over. Eriksson had come to attention in 1973 by going to Austria and digging up the remains of Belgian collaborator Cyriel Verschaeve, which he then reburied in Alveringem. He later claimed to have done the same with the remains of Staf De Clercq and Anton Mussert.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to test whether descriptive norms, or cognitions about typical beliefs, values, and behaviors of one’s group, can explain cultural influence in the domains of blame attribution and harm perception. In Study 1, using participants from the United States and South Korea, the authors find that individuals with lower (vs. higher) collectivistic descriptive norms ascribed more blame after more intentional acts and less blame after less intentional acts. In the second study, using American and South Korean participants, the authors find that individuals with lower (vs. higher) collectivistic descriptive norms perceived <b>more</b> harm <b>after</b> <b>right</b> violations and less harm after duty violations. Collectivistic personal attitudes did not predict the expected differences in attribution of blame or perception of harm. The descriptive norm account of cultural influence provides an alternative to the currently dominant personal attitude paradigm...|$|R

40|$|The study, {{which was}} guided by Prof. dr J. b. Rijsman as {{promotor}} and by Dr. Y. T. Tal as co- promotor, was a comparative interventional study {{that was designed to}} evaluate the effectiveness of different teaching & educational strategies of risk management and patient's safety in medicine. Eventually, 136 doctors from different medical professions and different seniority participated in the study and were randomly divided to three different groups. One group (53 participants) had a one hour lecture on the subject and another group (54 participants) had a one hour workshop training session dealing with the same content. The third group (29 participants) had a courseware learning session. All participants had to fill questionnaires, before the intervention, <b>right</b> <b>after</b> the learning session, two weeks after intervention and after three months. Demographic and personal professional data was collected. Questionnaires were designed and validated to collect information about the knowledge of participants, satisfaction from the learning session, willing to learn more on the subject and the attitudes towards risk management and patient's safety at the different points of time in each group of learners. Main results of the study showed that instruction by all three strategies was meaningful and effective, nevertheless there were differences of learning preferences – anesthesiologists preferred E- learning (and lectures as second choice), surgeons preferred E learning by far while pediatricians preferred it slightly more than other learning methods. Internists preferred lectures and gynecologists were indifferent in comparing the three learning strategies. Senior doctors showed statistically significant preference of workshops comparing to junior doctors that only slightly preferred workshops. E learners gained <b>more</b> knowledge <b>right</b> <b>after</b> the learning session but this faded quickly and after two weeks and three months the workshop group showed more knowledge and steady performance. The workshop group seemed to have gained more awareness to the importance of adverse event reporting and scored a bit higher almost in all aspects – though the difference was not always significant. The main conclusion of the study was that Instructional interventions might be best if tailored to the learning styles of specific groups of doctors. This is due to differences according to medical discipline and seniority in ratings of the various interventions. As this is the first attempt to deal with educational strategies effectiveness in medical risk management and patient's safety the researchers stated that they look forward for further studies of this subject...|$|R

50|$|Despite David's reputation, he was <b>more</b> {{fiercely}} criticized <b>right</b> <b>after</b> {{his death}} {{than at any}} point during his life. His style came under the most serious criticism for being static, rigid, and uniform throughout all his work. David's art was also attacked for being cold and lacking warmth. David, however, made his career precisely by challenging {{what he saw as}} the earlier rigidity and conformity of the French Royal Academy's approach to art. David's later works also reflect his growth {{in the development of the}} Empire style, notable for its dynamism and warm colors. It is likely that much of the criticism of David following his death came from David's opponents; during his lifetime David made a great many enemies with his competitive and arrogant personality as well as his role in the Terror. David sent many people to the guillotine and personally signed the death warrants for King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. One significant episode in David's political career that earned him a great deal of contempt was the execution of Emilie Chalgrin. A fellow painter Carle Vernet had approached David, who was on the Committee of Public Safety, requesting him to intervene on behalf of his sister, Chalgrin. She had been accused of crimes against the Republic, most notably possessing stolen items. David refused to intervene in her favor, and she was executed. Vernet blamed David for her death, and the episode followed him for the rest of his life and after.|$|R
