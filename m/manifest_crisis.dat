40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{contemporary}} crisis of neoliberal political economy, the politics of austerity has reasserted the liberal utility of the state as the political authority of market freedom. This article argues that economy has no independent existence, and that instead, economy is a political practice. It examines the political economy of Adam Smith and the German ordoliberal tradition to decipher the character of the political in political economy and its transformation from Smith's liberal theory into neoliberal theology. Ordoliberalism emerged in the late 1920 s at a time of a <b>manifest</b> <b>crisis</b> of political economy, and its argument was fundamental {{for the development of the}} neoliberal conception that free economy is matter of strong state authority. The conclusion argues with Marx that the state is the concentrated force of free economy...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 47 - 49) Little {{attention has}} been paid to the relationship of play and other social phenomena. Play theories have generally been concerned with psychological or physiological conditions of play. This philosophical inquiry focuses on play relative to social crises and morale. First, an attempt was made to discover a logical relationship of play to other well-known human needs. Second, selected play theories were reviewed to disclose a tension-release phenomenon which occurs as part of play. When an abundance of energy is accumulated, this energy tends to overflow, causing play to <b>manifest.</b> <b>Crisis</b> was defined as an upset in an already steady state. During crisis, a coping mechanism is set in motion that seeks to restore the previous level of equilibrium. Oftentimes, an even higher level is reached. Crisis as exemplified by the Second World War was seen to be a triggering mechanism, releasing the abundance of energy (or play) the individual might possess. Morale, an important need during crises was reviewed. By definition, it was determined that morale increases the amount of potential energy in the individual. Conversely, poor morale results in a lowering of potential energy and helps to explain degradation of the human spirit during crisis. In view of the demonstrated search for recreation, it was concluded that crisis, as demonstrated by the case of the Second World War, evokes a need to recreate (structured play). This may be due to the fact that people are seeking an escape route from an otherwise difficult situation. It may be that recreation needs are just greater under crisis conditions.

We are running the risk of accepting that neo-liberalism, with the corresponding totalization of the market, is the only possible alternative.

In this context, we can also understand the degradation of the politics that, within the given frame, offers itself as mere art of the possible. In order {{to carry out a}} critical assessment of the situation, we propose an itinerary through the thought of F. J.

Rather than make Marx irrelevant, however, the absence of global struggles for truly radical change make his early engagement with the role of philosophy more important than ever. This engagement suggests a conception of philosophy as a uniquely practical discipline distinguished from empirical science by its unique capacity to synthesise values from the facts of life. The article examines the development of this conception of philosophy in Marx’s early work and concludes with the outlines for a new critical philosophy capable of generating a new set of universal values necessary to motivate anti-capitalist struggles today...|$|R

Methods: In October 2013, the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America appointed a Task Force to develop treatment {{guidance for}} MG, and a panel of 15 international experts was convened. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology was used to develop consensus guidance statements. Definitions were developed for goals of treatment, minimal manifestations, remission, ocular MG, impending crisis, crisis, and refractory MG. An in-person panel meeting then determined 7 treatment topics to be addressed. Initial guidance statements were developed from literature summaries. Three rounds of anonymous e-mail votes were used to attain consensus on guidance statements modified on the basis of panel input. Results: Guidance statements were developed for symptomatic and immunosuppressive treatments, IV immunoglobulin and plasma exchange, management of impending and <b>manifest</b> myasthenic <b>crisis,</b> thymectomy, juvenile MG, MG associated with antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase, and MG in pregnancy.
