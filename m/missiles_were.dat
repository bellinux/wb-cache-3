5|$|On August 29, 2007, six AGM-129 ACM cruise missiles, each {{loaded with}} a W80-1 {{variable}} yield nuclear warhead, were mistakenly loaded onto a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52H heavy bomber at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and transported to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The nuclear warheads in the <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> {{supposed to have}} been removed before the <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> taken from their storage bunker. The missiles with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing, and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were not protected by the various mandatory security precautions for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between Serbs and Croats spread to eastern Slavonia in early 1991. On 1 April, Serb villagers around Vukovar and other towns in eastern Slavonia began to erect barricades across main roads. The White Eagles, a Serbian paramilitary {{group led by}} Vojislav Šešelj, moved into the Serb-populated village of Borovo Selo just north of Vukovar. In mid-April 1991, Armbrust shoulder-launched anti-tank <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> fired at Borovo Selo. According to one version of the event, <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> fired at agricultural machinery that served as barricades. According to a second version, three <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> fired at houses inhabited by Serbs. There were no casualties, but the attack aggravated and deepened ethnic tensions. On 2 May, Serb paramilitaries ambushed two Croatian police buses in the centre of Borovo Selo, killing 12 policemen and injuring 22 more. Three Serbs were also killed. The Battle of Borovo Selo represented the worst act of violence between the country's Serbs and Croats since the Second World War. It enraged many Croatians {{and led to a}} surge of ethnic violence across Slavonia.|$|E
50|$|The Surya <b>missile</b> <b>is</b> an {{intercontinental}} ballistic <b>missile</b> speculated to <b>be</b> {{in development}} by India. As the <b>missile</b> <b>is</b> {{yet to be}} developed, the specifications of the <b>missile</b> <b>are</b> not known and the entire program continues to remain highly secretive.|$|R
50|$|The <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> {{successfully}} tested without {{control and}} guidance systems on 9 May to 12 May 2003. The <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> again successfully tested on 25 March 2007. On 27 March, vertical {{launch of the}} <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> carried out, suggesting {{the use of the}} missile as a long-range surface-to-air missile for the Indian Navy to arm its destroyers and frigates and for the Indian Air Force. The ground testing of the Astra <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> successful. The <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> successfully tested on 13 September 2008.|$|R
25|$|The Trident <b>missile</b> <b>is</b> a submarine-launched {{ballistic}} missile (SLBM) equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV). Originally developed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Corporation, the <b>missile</b> <b>is</b> armed with thermonuclear warheads and is launched from nuclear-powered {{ballistic missile}} submarines (SSBNs). Trident <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> carried by fourteen US Navy s, with US warheads, and four Royal Navy s, with British warheads. The <b>missile</b> <b>is</b> {{named after the}} mythological trident of Neptune.|$|R
5|$|On August 20, 1985, Israel sent 96 American-made TOW {{missiles}} to Iran through an arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar. Subsequently, on September 14, 1985, 408 more TOW <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> delivered. On September 15, 1985, following the second delivery, Reverend Benjamin Weir {{was released by}} his captors, the Islamic Jihad Organization.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, heat-seeking <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> {{developed}} {{that had a}} range greater than the visual acuity of pilots. Aircraft camouflage now had two major threats {{that it was not}} able to fully defeat—radar and infrared detection. Camouflage accordingly became less important. However, by the 1980s, aircraft such as the ground attack A-10 Thunderbolt (Warthog) were painted in camouflage schemes that included both disruptive ground coloration and automimicry (deceptive self-imitation), {{in the form of a}} false canopy on the underside.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} quarter of the 20th century heavy {{industry}} was replaced by service-based activities including data processing, call centres, hi-tech electronics and IT companies. The town retains some traditional industries employing people in paper-manufacturing, packaging, textiles, transportation, steel foundries and building materials. <b>Missiles</b> <b>were</b> produced at the British Aerospace (BAe) factory in Lostock, now closed. The Reebok brand's European headquarters are located at the Reebok Stadium. Bolton is also the home of the family bakery, Warburtons, established in 1876 on Blackburn Road. On 13 February 2003, Bolton was granted Fairtrade Town status.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>missile</b> item <b>is</b> {{indicated}} {{with a large}} [...] "M." [...] Homing <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> fired {{two at a time}} in {{the forward}} direction, and will change course to pursue enemies. The newly-added anti-ground missile (Scatter Bomb <b>missile)</b> <b>is</b> fired downwards, and explodes upon contact with the ground. Only one type of <b>missile</b> can <b>be</b> equipped at one time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} AT-2A (3M11 Falanga) <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> problematic - one Russian source {{describes the}} missile as [...] "notable for its complexity and low reliability". Also, the <b>missile's</b> range <b>was</b> {{felt to be}} inadequate. An improved version of the <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> developed: the AT-2B (9M17 Skorpion). Externally, the <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> very similar; however, the AT-2B range is increased to 3.5 km. The standard production version was the 9M17M Skorpion-M, which entered service in 1968.|$|R
5000|$|The MIM-104C PAC-2 <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} Patriot <b>missile</b> that <b>was</b> {{optimized}} for ballistic missile engagements. The GEM series of <b>missiles</b> (MIM-104D/E) <b>are</b> further refinements of the PAC-2 missile. The PAC-3 <b>missile</b> <b>is</b> a new interceptor, featuring a Ka band active radar seeker, employing [...] "hit-to-kill" [...] interception (in contrast to previous interceptors' method of exploding {{in the vicinity}} of the target, destroying it with shrapnel), and several other enhancements which dramatically increase its lethality against ballistic missiles. The specific information for these different kinds of <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> discussed in the [...] "Variants" [...] section.|$|R
5|$|On 23 October 1962, President Kennedy {{ordered a}} naval {{quarantine}} of Cuba {{in response to}} the presence of Soviet missiles on the soil of that island nation. Yancey sortied in support of the American operations in the Caribbean, and remained on station until the <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> removed and tensions were relaxed. Over the next few years, Yancey made regular deployments to the Mediterranean to take part in joint exercises with NATO forces.|$|E
5|$|The <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> {{launched}} {{three days}} after Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Nike-X plans, Sprint {{was the primary}} weapon and thus {{was considered to be}} an extremely high-priority development. To speed development, a sub-scale version of Sprint known as Squirt was tested from Launch Complex 37 at White Sands, the former Nike Ajax/Hercules test area. A total of five Squirts were fired between 6 November 1964 and 1965. The first Sprint Propulsion Test Vehicle (PTV) was launched from another area at the same complex on 17 November 1965, only 25 months after the final design was signed off. Sprint testing pre-dated construction of an MSR, and the <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> initially guided by Zeus TTR and MTR radars. Testing continued under Safeguard, with a total of 42 test flights at White Sands and another 34 at Kwajalein.|$|E
50|$|The Zeus <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> enhanced, and {{the shorter}} range Sprint <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> {{added to the}} Nike defense system, then called Nike-X. The system {{included}} large powerful radars and a computer complex.|$|R
50|$|In early 2012, during Velayete-90 wargames, a Noor <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> {{tested with}} {{improvements}} in electronic systems, a more jam-resistant radar and better target acquisition algorithms. A Qader <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> also {{tested in the}} wargame.|$|R
50|$|A land-attack missile(LAM) is a naval surface-to-surface <b>missile</b> that <b>is</b> {{capable of}} {{effectively}} attacking targets ashore, unlike specialized anti-ship <b>missiles,</b> which <b>are</b> optimized for striking other ships. Some dual-role <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> suitable for both missions.|$|R
5|$|On 1 May, {{the first}} mission was {{conducted}} by a single Vulcan (XM607) that flew over Port Stanley and dropped its bombs on the airfield concentrating on the single runway, with one direct hit, making it unsuitable for fighter aircraft. The Vulcan's mission was quickly followed up by strikes against anti-air installations, flown by British Aerospace Sea Harriers from nearby Royal Navy carriers. Three Vulcan missions were flown against the airfield, a further two missions in which <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> launched against radar installations; an additional two missions were cancelled. At the time, these missions held {{the record for the}} world's longest-distance raids. The ECM systems on board the Vulcans proved to be effective at jamming Argentine radars; while a Vulcan was within the theatre, other British aircraft in the vicinity had a greatly reduced chance of coming under effective fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage to}} the citadel, {{especially}} to its northern and western walls, was only repaired in 1407. In 1414, governor of Damascus Nawruz al-Hafizi, sought refuge in the citadel against the army of Sultan Al-Mu'ayyad Shaykh. The citadel was bombarded by trebuchet and cannon. The siege ended when a treaty of surrender was signed. In 1461, the southwest tower collapsed in a fire when <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> fired from it to force the rebellious governor of Damascus to leave the city. This tower and four others were rebuilt in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, indicating that the repairs of 1407 had been carried out in haste.|$|E
5|$|The nose cone, which {{contained}} the ordnance that would impact the target, would {{separate from the}} rocket booster. This made the rocket lighter as only the nose cone and its ordnance {{had to be able}} to survive re-entry, rather than the rocket. The unique innovations of the Hiroc missiles, such as the gimballed engines, and the internally supported frame, would go on to inspire the Atlas rockets. Several things changed however, such as the aluminum used for the missiles skin of the Hiroc, was switched out for stainless steel in the Atlas, because stainless steel had a higher melting point. The engines of the Atlas <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> also much stronger, generating a total of 150,000 pounds-force (667,000 Newtons), compared to the Hiroc's total of 8,000 pounds-force (35,585 Newtons).|$|E
50|$|Both <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> torpedo-tube launched, with a solid-fuel {{rocket engine}} to power them above the surface. Both <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> dual-role; {{they can be}} armed with either a 400 mm anti-submarine torpedo or a nuclear depth charge.|$|R
50|$|The missile has a Granit type engine. It can be {{operated}} on new Yasen-class submarine, {{and can be}} loaded on ships. Coastal versions of the anti-ship <b>missile</b> <b>are</b> under development. The <b>missile</b> <b>is</b> developed at NPO Mashinostroyeniya.|$|R

5|$|Between 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm {{approximately}} 800 prisoners had surrendered, and {{arrangements were}} made {{for them to be}} transferred to other prisons. At 8:00 pm Governor O'Friel agreed that prison officers should enter E wing, and at 8:05 pm approximately ten Control & Restraint (C) units each consisting of twelve prison officers entered the wing. By 8:10 pm all four landings of E wing had been secured, and one C unit progressed to the Centre where they fought with rioting prisoners. This was reported to Governor O'Friel, who instructed the officers not to move beyond E wing. Scaffolding poles and other <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> thrown at the C teams from the roof area above the fourth landing in E wing, and when prisoners broke onto the wing the C teams withdrew at 0:22 am on 2 April, leaving prisoners in control of the wing. Up to 1,100 of the 1,647 prisoners were involved in the rioting, {{and by the end of}} the first day 700 had surrendered and been transferred to other prisons along with 400 prisoners who were not involved in the rioting. Between 200 and 350 prisoners occupied the rooftop of the main prison during the night.|$|E
5|$|Brodie {{was named}} as York's Players' Player of the Year for the season, {{as well as}} being awarded the Keith Walwyn Golden Boot, having scored 32 goals at that point. York {{finished}} fifth in the Conference Premier, and Brodie was the division's joint top scorer alongside Matt Tubbs with 26 goals. He scored the winning goal on 89 minutes to give York a 1–0 home victory against Luton in the play-off semi-final first leg. He played in the 1–0 away victory in the second leg, meaning York won the tie 2–0 on aggregate. After the match, Brodie was hit by a coin, with the squad being forced {{into the back of a}} stand after <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> thrown at them by a section of Luton fans. He started in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 16 May 2010, in which York lost 3–1 to Oxford. He finished 2009–10 with 51 appearances and 34 goals, making him York's highest goalscorer in a season since Bottom scored 39 in 1954–55. York entered negotiations over a new contract with Brodie after the end of the season. At the Football Conference's Annual Presentation Dinner, he was named the Conference Premier Player of the Year and a member of the Team of the Year.|$|E
5|$|In the event, {{the biggest}} threat Gibraltar faced in the 20th century came from the air. The only action seen by Gibraltar's coastal defences during the First World War {{occurred}} in August 1917 when the 6-inch gun at Devil's Gap Battery engaged and sank a German U-boat travelling on the surface. The Second World War presented a much greater challenge to Gibraltar's defences {{as a result of}} the development of long-range bomber aircraft. Numerous anti-aircraft positions were established across Gibraltar, many of them built on top of existing fortifications and equipped with 40mm and 3.7-inch anti-aircraft guns. By March 1941 there were twenty-eight 3.7-inch guns and twenty-two (and eventually forty-eight) Bofors guns, plus two pom-pom guns. Numerous searchlights were installed – by 1942 there were twenty-four located around Gibraltar – and rocket projectors, an early though rather ineffectual form of anti-aircraft <b>missiles,</b> <b>were</b> also brought in. Bunkers and pillboxes were built to guard against amphibious landings, especially on the eastern side of the Rock, and anti-tank guns, ditches and obstacles were installed facing the isthmus to guard against a land attack.|$|E
50|$|Anti-ship <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> guided <b>missiles</b> that <b>are</b> {{designed}} for use against ships and large boats. Most anti-ship <b>missiles</b> <b>are</b> of the sea skimming variety, and many {{use a combination of}} inertial guidance and active radar homing. A good number of other anti-ship missiles use infrared homing to follow the heat that is emitted by a ship; it is also possible for anti-ship <b>missiles</b> to <b>be</b> guided by radio command all the way.|$|R
5000|$|When {{launched}} the <b>missile</b> <b>is</b> propelled from the launch tube at around 72 {{meters per second}} by a gas generator {{at the rear of}} the launch tube. Once the <b>missile</b> <b>is</b> clear of the launch tube the sustainer motor engages and accelerates the missile to a speed of 250 meters per second. Once the <b>missile</b> <b>is</b> about 400 meters from the launcher, the sustainer motor cuts out and the missile continues in free flight.|$|R
50|$|On 26 June, the United States {{conducted}} {{its third}} ABM {{test of the}} month, when a THAAD <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> used to intercept a Threat Representative Ballistic <b>Missile.</b> The TRBM <b>was</b> launched from a C-17 Globemaster III aircraft, flying over the Pacific Ocean, at 02:16 UTC. A THAAD <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> launched from the Kwajalein Missile Range at 02:22, and the <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> successfully intercepted, during the stage at which the mock warhead separated from the missile. The THAAD did not leave the atmosphere, however the target did.|$|R
5|$|The RAAF squadrons {{remained}} at Butterworth {{as part of}} Australia's contribution to the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve. Eight Sabres, along with their pilots and ground crew, were detached from No.77 Squadron in May 1962 to re-form No.79 Squadron at Ubon, Thailand. The Sabres were flown to Thailand via Singapore to give the appearance {{that they were not}} drawn from the Strategic Reserve, thus preserving Malaysia's neutrality. Personnel and equipment from Nos.3 and 77Squadrons continued to rotate through No.79 Squadron on a regular basis. The Butterworth-based Sabres, armed with Sidewinder <b>missiles,</b> <b>were</b> responsible for regional air defence during the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia from July 1963 until August 1966, though no combat took place. From 26October until 27November 1965, a detachment of six Sabres from No.77 Squadron was based at Labuan to conduct combat patrols over the Indonesian–Malaysian border on Borneo. Following the disbandment of No.78 Wing in November 1967, No.77 Squadron became an independently operating unit under the command of Headquarters RAAF Butterworth.|$|E
5|$|The RAF {{activated}} 20 squadrons between September 1958 and December 1959 {{to operate}} the 120 Thor missiles. They were located at 20 old wartime airfields so that {{the government did not}} have to purchase the land. Each missile was supplied with its own Mark 49 warhead, a variant of the Mark 28 with a thinner and lighter casing. While the Thor missile bases were manned by the RAF, the warheads were supplied under Project E. Each one had a USAF authorisation officer. The missiles used a dual key system, one of which was held by the authorisation officer. Occasionally a missile would be chosen for test firing, for which the missile and its RAF crew would be flown to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Twelve test firings were conducted between 6 October 1959 and 12 June 1962. Under the original agreement, the USAF paid the cost of maintenance for the missiles for five years. After a debate over costs and benefits, the Air Council decided on 31 May 1962 that Project Emily should be terminated by the end of 1963. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963. The <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> returned to the United States.|$|E
5|$|The RAF {{high command}} never warmed to missiles, and always ranked them {{secondary}} to the V-bomber force. The missile bases were separate {{from the rest of}} the RAF and its personnel considered outside the mainstream. Project Emily gave the RAF considerable experience in missile operations, but the cancellation of Blue Streak on 2 February 1960 in favour of Skybolt, an air-launched ballistic missile, rendered this expertise of dubious value. Given the amount of time and money spent on Thor, consideration was given to extending the deployment. Responding to the arguments made for and against Blue Streak, there were proposals for improving Thor. If the <b>missiles</b> <b>were</b> already fuelled, then they could be launched in as little as 60 seconds, but they could only remain fuelled for two hours, after which components froze from contact with the liquid oxygen. The missiles then needed six hours to thaw out. It was impractical to base them underground, but being above ground made them very vulnerable to a nuclear attack. Yet the twenty Thor missiles squadrons were equivalent to seven and a half squadrons of V-bombers. Without them, there would be just fourteen V-bombers on quick alert.|$|E
50|$|The SRAM II (Short-Range Attack <b>Missile)</b> <b>was</b> {{a nuclear}} air-to-surface missile {{intended}} {{as a replacement for}} the AGM-69 SRAM, but it was cancelled by President George H.W. Bush for geopolitical reasons just as the first flight-test <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> delivered.|$|R
5000|$|R-39UTTH [...] "Bark", NATO {{reporting}} name SS-NX-28, was a Russian submarine-launched ballistic <b>missile.</b> The <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> an {{upgraded version}} of the R-39 <b>missile</b> that <b>was</b> designed for the Typhoon class. The new <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> to be carried by the new Russian nuclear submarines of the Borei class. The third test launch of a prototype R-39M on 25 November 1998 resulted in a catastrophic failure of the SLBM's booster. The missile exploded roughly 200 meters after take-off from its ground-based launch facility. Having failed its first three test firings the project was ordered abandoned by the Russian Security Council. The <b>missile</b> <b>was</b> later replaced by the Bulava and Layner missile systems.|$|R
