5|$|As {{part of its}} {{campaign}} against shipping, around each full moon from late January 1945 XXBomber Command conducted minelaying missions. On the night of 25/26January, 41 B-29s from the 444th and 468th Bombardment Groups laid six minefields in the approaches to Singapore. On the same night other B-29s laid <b>mines</b> off Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay {{as part of the}} largest single aerial minelaying effort in the Pacific up to that time. On the night of 27/28February, twelve B-29s were dispatched to lay <b>mines</b> in the Straits of Johor near Singapore. Ten of these aircraft successfully deployed 55 <b>mines</b> in the target area, and another aircraft mined Penang. During the next full moon period on the night of 28/29March, 22 B-29s laid <b>mines</b> near Singapore. No aircraft were lost during these missions.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after the {{publication}} of Maximinus's first edict, perhaps in 307, Maximinus changed the penalty for transgressions. Instead of receiving the death penalty, Christians would now be mutilated and condemned to labor in state-owned <b>mines.</b> Since Egyptian <b>mines</b> were overstaffed, mostly due to the influx of Christian prisoners, Egyptian penitents were increasingly sent to the copper <b>mines</b> at Phaeno in Palestine and Cilicia in Asia Minor. At Diocaesarea (Tzippori, Israel) in the spring of 308, 97 Christian confessors were received by Firmilianus from the porphyry <b>mines</b> in the Thebaid. Firmilianus cut the tendons on their left feet, blinded their right eyes, and sent them to the <b>mines</b> of Palestine. On another occasion, 130 others received the same punishment. Some were sent to Phaeno, and some to Cilicia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Cornish mining {{industry}} went into decline, public opposition to the use of female and child labour in <b>mines</b> was rising. The Metalliferous <b>Mines</b> Regulation Act 1872 brought the <b>mines</b> of Cornwall under the provisions of the <b>Mines</b> Act 1842, which had previously applied only to coal <b>mines,</b> limiting the use of child labour in the <b>mines</b> and thus increasing costs. The Act prohibited women from working underground, which the bal maidens did not do, but it also forbade any child under ten from working in any mine, even on the surface. The passing of the Factory and Workshop Act 1878 drastically limited the use of female and child labour. The employment of children under 10 was banned outright, the maximum working hours for children aged 10–14 were drastically restricted, and women were banned from working over 56 hours per week. The sudden loss of cheap child labourers made the already weakened mining industries of Cornwall and West Devon even less profitable, and more than half the <b>mines</b> in the area went out of business in the following decade. Some bal maidens continued to work in surviving <b>mines</b> and in tin-streaming, but instability in the metal markets made what remained of the mining industries increasingly unviable. In the 1880s William Ewart Gladstone's Liberal government tried to ban female labour from <b>mines</b> altogether; although the Bill was defeated, the number of bal maidens continued to fall. At the 1891 census the number of working bal maidens had fallen to around half its 1850s–60s peak. By 1895 only 23 <b>mines</b> remained operational compared to 307 in 1873, and in 1901 Devon Great Consols, the last significant copper mine in Devon and Cornwall, closed. Electrification and the introduction of Frue Vanners at the surviving <b>mines</b> replaced most of the jobs still done by women, and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 very few bal maidens remained in employment. With wartime shortages of raw materials and many younger men in the armed forces, some bal maidens were temporarily rehired to dress potash ore at a re-opened mine at St Austell, and to re-dress the existing spoil heaps of defunct <b>mines</b> for wolfram and arsenic.|$|E

5|$|The {{other major}} {{factors in the}} decline of coal {{were related to the}} massive {{under-investment}} in Rhondda <b>mines</b> over the past decades. Most of the <b>mines</b> in the valleys were sunk between the 1850s and 1880s, which, as a consequence, meant they were far smaller than most modern <b>mines.</b> The Rhondda <b>mines</b> were in comparison antiquated, with methods of ventilation, coal-preparation and power supply all of a poor standard. In 1945 the British coal industry cut 72 per cent of their output mechanically, whereas in South Wales the figure was just 22 per cent. The only way to ensure the financial survival of the <b>mines</b> in the valleys was massive investment from the NCB, but the 'Plan for Coal' paper drawn up in 1950 was overly optimistic in the future demand for coal, which was drastically reduced following an industrial recession in 1956 and an increased availability of oil.|$|E
5|$|The {{pulling power}} of the Trait du Nord made it popular for use during the Industrial Revolution of the late 19th century in heavy industry, {{including}} mining. In <b>mines,</b> steam engines and internal combustion engines {{could not be used}} due to the possibility of a gas explosion. The first horses were used in the <b>mines</b> in 1821 and the Trait du Nord quickly became a favorite for hauling carts in the <b>mines</b> and operating the pulleys used to lift coal to the surface. Breeders worked to adapt the breed to mining requirements, and the breed became larger as more power was needed to pull heavier loads. Good horses were able to pull , usually around twelve cars worth, along a railway. As early as 1920, the usage of horses in <b>mines</b> began to decline as electric locomotives came into use, and in 1969 the last horse was removed from the <b>mines.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} after the strike, the world's silver market dropped, causing the {{foreclosure}} {{of many of the}} <b>mines.</b> To compensate for the drop in prices, the mines' stockholders reduced the wages of the miners. Instead of striking again, the miners accepted this. In addition, the miners inadvertently dug below the water table, and the mine shafts began filling with water faster than it could be pumped out. By 1884, most of the <b>mines</b> were idle or closed; the last was officially closed in 1891, although lessees of the <b>mines</b> continued to operate them past that year. Many merchants went bankrupt and left town. The Silver Reef <b>mines</b> produced about $8million worth of silver ore. Between 1891 and 1901, another $250,000 worth was mined. Several people attempted to restart mining operations in 1898, 1909, 1916, and 1950, but none of these attempts were successful. After Silver Reef's <b>mines</b> were closed, many of the buildings were purchased for their lumber and building stone.
