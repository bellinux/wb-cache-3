50|$|<b>Macrocheilia</b> is a {{condition}} of permanent swelling of the lip that results from greatly distended lymphatic spaces. This causes an abnormal largeness of the lips. This is sometimes seen in leprosy patients.|$|E
40|$|Two- {{patients}} had Melkersson-Rosenthalâ€² syndrome. One {{of them had}} all the 3 components of the syndrome-facial paralysis, plicated tongue and <b>macrocheilia,</b> while the other had only 2 components-macrocheilia and plicated tongue. Oral antihistamine therapy for 3 weeks was ineffective in. both cases. But appreciable clinical response occurred after clofazimine therapy in both cases...|$|E
40|$|Oral leprosy, a granulomatous {{disease is}} {{classified}} under the term oro-facial granulomatosis which comprises {{a group of}} diseases characterized by noncaseating granulomas affecting the soft tissues of the oral and maxillofacial region. The most common clinical presentation of oro-facial granulomatous conditions is persistent swelling of one or both lips. Due to its rare incidence and clinical findings overlapping with other granulomatous conditions such as sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, and cheilitis granulomatosa; it is practically difficult for a dental surgeon to easily diagnose this condition. This study presents a case of leprosy causing <b>macrocheilia</b> as the only clinical presentation and diagnosed initially as Miescher's cheilitis based on exclusion criteria...|$|E
40|$|<b>Macrocheilia</b> is a {{challenging}} {{problem with a}} variety of underlying causes that are both local and systemic, and granulomatous causes underlie the majority of cases. In this study, we report on a 31 -year old man who presented with a chronic lower lip enlargement and a nodular submental erythematous lesion. He was otherwise clinically healthy. Laboratory test results were within the normal limit except for a positive anti-double stranded DNA test result. A diagnosis of cutaneous lupus erythematosus was {{made on the basis of}} histopathology and direct immunofluorescence. The lesions resolved dramatically after treatment with hydroxychloroquine. Lupus erythematosus should be considered when examining patients who present with chronic lip swelling...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{clinical}} case of Melkersson-Rosenthal (M-R) syndrome associated with Down syndrome. No {{evidence of this}} association is described in the literature. We also present a technique for the <b>macrocheilia</b> treatment of lower lip caused by M-R syndrome in a patient with Down syndrome. This patient during pediatric age had many events of facial nerve paralysis and edematous episodes of lower lip with unknown etiology. This technique {{is based on a}} wedge full thickness central excision of the lower lip and on a transversal lozenge excision in the vermilion portion with orbicular muscle to reverse the chin-labial corner. The results are an agreeable aspect of the lip and physiological digestive and phonetic processes. The technique is safe and simple and the aesthetic functional result is very good. In our case, the postoperative complication is caused by an insufficient collaboration of the patient and it is solved in three weeks...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pendred {{syndrome}} is a rare, inherited, autosomal recessive disorder with an iodine organification defect of thyroxin {{produced by the}} thyroid gland. Its clinical features include sensorineural hearing loss, classically congenital and prelingual, and goiter. Methods: This is the first case report of Pendred syndrome in the dental literature with oral findings that include localized extensive attachment loss involving mandibular incisor teeth and idiopathic hypercementosis involving multiple teeth {{in addition to other}} oral manifestations, suggesting hypothyroidism-like macroglossia and <b>macrocheilia.</b> Furthermore, serum alkaline phosphatase along with inorganic calcium and phosphate levels were also elevated. Peripheral neutrophil function test suggested a defective function of neutrophils. Results: Management of the case included augmenting thyroxin supplementation, in consultation with an endocrinologist, and extraction of hopeless mandibular central incisors followed by placement of immediate transitional dentures. Conclusion: A comprehensive medical history and systemic and laboratory evaluations should be considered a prerequisite to identify, manage, and report such rare conditions in routine clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|Erythema multiforme is an {{uncommon}} acute inflammatory disorder caused {{by exposure to}} microbes or drugs. Erythema multiforme minor typically affects only one mucosa and {{can be associated with}} symmetrical target skin lesions on the extremities. The disease usually occurs in patients in their 3 rd and 4 th decade of life, but can also affect children and adolescents. Alendronate sodium has been approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, but is associated with adverse events. This study reports and discusses a case of erythema multiforme minor. In addition, a literature search of articles published in PubMed-Medline was performed. The case was a 96 -year-old woman who had taken alendronate. Intraoral clinical examination demonstrated hypersalivation and <b>macrocheilia</b> of the lower lip, associated with an ill-defined ulcer with erythematous borders measuring 20 mm in greatest diameter and covered with serofibrinous exudates. The aging of the population in developed and developing countries has increased the use of alendronate sodium to prevent osteoporosis and clinicians should be aware of possible oral adverse events associated with this drug...|$|E
40|$|Cosmetic lip augmentation, {{regardless}} of the filling agent, is nowadays {{one of the most}} requested aesthetic procedures. Liquid silicone injections were used in the past, but after reports of severe late complications their use has been discontinued, ending with a permanent ban in most western countries. In this report we describe clinical presentation, diagnostic pathways and surgical reconstruction of six patients presenting with <b>macrocheilia</b> due to previous liquid silicone augmentation. Patients showed chronic inflammation of the lower third of the face, lip eversion, various degrees of asymmetry and functional impairment of the lips. All patients underwent preoperative soft tissue High Frequency Ultrasound (HFUS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the of the face to obtain evidence of the filler material and to ascertain its diffusion within the soft tissues of the perioral region. Conservative surgery was carried out to remove foreign material and to restore symmetric aesthetically pleasing lips. Histology confirmed the siliconoma diagnosis. HFUS and RMI allowed to clearly identify the silicone within the soft tissues. The conservative surgery restored the harmonious relationship between the lips, with an improvement in lip functionality at long term follow-up. Healing was complete and uneventful in all of the patients...|$|E
