25|$|The {{other major}} {{sticking}} point, which is reportedly causing concern at government level, {{is that the}} majority of people going to Potsdamer Platz are visitors to the city, implying that the original vision of the development as a linking element attracting Berliners themselves, and Berliners {{from both sides of the}} former divide, has not really materialised. There are criticisms that the development does not sit easily with or connect with its surroundings, and as a result Berliners have had difficulty accepting it as theirs (despite the fact that the choice of Hilmer & Sattler's masterplan was partly because it was the only one to address the way the development juxtaposed with the Cultural Forum immediately to the west, although the Cultural Forum has itself faced similar criticisms of its own). Another, more psychological factor that has played a part here is that a long-standing mutual distrust or antipathy felt between former East Berliners and West Berliners (Ossis and Wessis according to the well-known slang terms), is still very much in evidence in the city and elsewhere in Germany, and bold civil engineering projects and architectural statements are not going to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> by themselves.

In her opinion the main weakness {{of the film is}} the belief that the leaders of G8 can do anything to actually handle poverty.: The Girl in the Café had one unforgivable and entirely avoidable flaw: oversimplification. Presenting a complex issue in such a one-dimensional way is not only patronising, it also devalues the message. Michael Moore-ism has its place in this world, but not on the BBC, and not at the taxpayer's expense.... It is deeply wrong that 30,000 children should die each day because of poverty.

In proportion to the relief she felt, Mrs. Milray protested her irreconcilable grief; but when the simpler Mrs. Atwell proposed her going and reasoning with Clementina, she said, No, no; better let her alone, if she felt as she did; and perhaps after all she was right.|$|R

Once she calms down, they spend some time on the rooftop patio rehearsing lines from Anna's next film. She also apologizes for the previous incident, telling Will her boyfriend simply showed up out of the blue and the relationship had broken down long before then. When she sees a poster of the Marc Chagall painting La Mariée on his kitchen wall, Anna tells Will that [...] "it feels like how love should be". That night, Anna goes to him and they have sex. The next morning, the press (inadvertently tipped off by Spike) besiege Will's house and get pictures of both him and Anna half-dressed. While packing to leave, a furious Anna accuses Will of exploiting the situation for his own benefit and declares that she regrets their time together, because the press will <b>make</b> sure <b>it</b> never <b>goes</b> <b>away.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Bo' Selecta! was {{broadcast}} on Channel 4 {{and ran for}} three series between 2002 and 2004, spawning several spin-offs. Francis played central character Avid Merrion, a dangerously insane stalker, who is obsessed with celebrities and tracks them down. The show consists of sketches involving various celebrities, portrayed by Francis in a latex mask. The most popular sketches involve entertainers such as Elton John, David Blaine, Kelly Osbourne, Michael Jackson, Mel B and central character Craig David. Avid Merrion would appear in his own sketches placed throughout each episode. Another recurring character on the show played by Francis is [...] "the Bear", a perverted teddy bear who interviews (real, as opposed to portrayed) celebrity guests, where he will make them read a bedtime story to him. Each story starts off {{the same way and}} ends with the celebrity (usually female) performing a sexual act, causing the Bear to have an erection (at which point he would shout [...] "Christine Hamilton!

The BBC also reported that former Daily Mirror crime correspondent Jeff Edwards, who stated he was told by a detective in the 1980s that an investigation into paedophiles was closed on the orders of a senior politician, had recently been contacted by the police. He told the BBC: [...] "I think this was a cynical cover up. There was no doubt in their minds the way they would deal with this was simply to expunge it from the record.

Johnny eventually meets Charlie and proposes to work with him, but first Charlie disagrees because his acquaintance seems a clever, witty trickster and for his simple taste. In the end, however, the two combine to sabotage the gangsters' plots with gleeful fisticuffs in the ensuing melee. Amongst this backdrop, Charlie, in despair, finds out he is the illegitimate brother of Johnny during an escapade of his father - still alive unbeknownst to Charlie - who pretends to be blind in order to collect a pension.
