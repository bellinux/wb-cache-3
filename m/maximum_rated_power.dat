50|$|For a given power supply, {{efficiency}} varies {{depending on}} how much power is being delivered. Supplies are typically most efficient at between half and three quarters load, much less efficient at low load, and somewhat less efficient at maximum load. Older ATX power supplies were typically 60% to 75% efficient. To qualify for 80 Plus, a power supply must achieve at least 80% efficiency at three specified loads (20%, 50% and 100% of <b>maximum</b> <b>rated</b> <b>power).</b> However, 80 Plus supplies may still be less than 80% efficient at lower loads. For instance, an 80 Plus, 520 watt supply could still be 70% or less efficient at 60 watts (a typical idle power for a desktop computer). Thus it is still important to select a supply with capacity appropriate to the device being powered.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the two earlier engines, {{which could}} use either a Roots blower or a {{turbocharger}}, the 710 engine is offered only with turbocharging. The turbocharger (a combination turbo-compressor system) follows EMD's innovative design {{that uses a}} gear train and over-running clutch to drive the compressor rotor. This system acts as a centrifugal blower, during low engine speed, when exhaust gas temperature (and, correspondingly, heat energy) alone is insufficient to drive the turbine. At higher engine speeds, increased exhaust gas temperature is sufficient to drive the turbine, the clutch disengages, and acts as a true centrifugal turbocharger. The turbo-compressor can revert to compressor mode momentarily during demands for large increases in engine output power. While more expensive to maintain than Roots blowers, the turbocharger significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions, while improving high-altitude performance. Additionally, EMD's turbo-compressor can provide a 50 percent increase in maximum rated horsepower over Roots-blown engines for the same engine displacement. But, unlike the earlier 645 and 567, which offered both Roots-blown and turbocharging, EMD's turbo-compressor {{is an integral part}} of all 710 models, therefore this 50 percent increase is already incorporated into the <b>maximum</b> <b>rated</b> <b>power</b> of all 710 models. The putative horsepower of an otherwise equivalent displacement, but Roots-blown (i.e., [...] "supercharged") 710, may be approximated by multiplying the turbocharged horsepower by 0.67.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Radio signals {{typically}} {{are subject to}} very large transmission losses and distortions due to nonlinearities that might be added by the limited dynamic range of power amplifiers [1], [2].

40|$|Evapotranspiration cools {{the land}} surface by {{consuming}} a large {{fraction of the}} net radiative energy at the surface. In forested regions, trees actively control the rate of transpiration by modulating stomatal conductance in response to environmental conditions, and species with different stomatal dynamics can affect the atmosphere in distinct ways. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter estimation with direct, tree-level measurements of water use, we show that Douglas-firs (Pseudotsuga menziesii), a common evergreen needleleaf tree species in the Northern California Coast Range, decrease their transpiration sharply in the summer dry season {{in response to a}} dry root zone; and in contrast, broadleaf evergreen tree species, especially Pacific madrones (Arbutus menziesii), transpire maximally in the summer dry season because their transpiration is much less sensitive to a dry root zone and increases continually in response to increasing atmospheric evaporative demand. We scale up these tree-level observations to construct a bottom-up estimate of regional transpiration, and we use these regional estimates along with atmospheric models, one simple and one comprehensive, to quantify the potential impact of species transpiration differences on regional summertime climate. The atmospheric models suggest that these species differences in transpiration could affect the well-mixed atmospheric boundary layer temperature and humidity by 1 - 1. 5 degrees C and 1 g/kg, respectively, and near-surface temperature and humidity by 1. 5 - 2. 5 degrees C and 2 - 3 g/kg, respectively. We further investigate the sensitivity of California climate to evapotranspiration by estimating the sensitivity of wind energy forecasts at a California wind farm to regional-scale perturbations in soil moisture using a regional atmospheric model. These tests show that forecasts at this particular farm are most sensitive to soil moisture in the Central Valley, and that changes in soil moisture on the order of previously-demonstrated errors in atmospheric reanalyses lead to wind energy forecast errors of 1 - 3 m/s, which can translate to differences in forecasted wind energy of 15 - 40 % of a wind farm’s <b>maximum</b> <b>rated</b> <b>power...</b>|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been great {{technology}} improvement in wireless communication systems. Novel transceiver architectures and circuits have enabled faster data transfer rate over larger area while burning even less power. CMOS technology, by its unique advantages in cost and integration, has enabled an unprecedented level of integration in modern low-cost, small form-factor and low-power wireless devices. The two aspects above put together has made our phones, mp 3 players, etc., smarter and smaller, and most importantly, has made our lives more pleasant. There have been great efforts contributed to integrating the whole transceiver into one single silicon die. However, Radio Frequency (RF) Power Amplifiers (PAs) are still among those few remaining modules {{that have yet to}} be successfully integrated. The reduced supply voltage, high on-chip passive loss, and the low breakdown voltage of the thin gate oxide CMOS devices are among the most difficult challenges, which have forced high output power CMOS PAs to operate under large-current and low-impedance levels, where they are vulnerable to parasitic losses. On the other hand, efficiency is a big concern in PA designs. Due to the inevitable power back-off in modern communication systems, it is of great importance to improve the efficiency of a PA when it does not work at its <b>maximum</b> <b>rated</b> <b>power.</b> This work targets two major issues: power combining and average efficiency enhancement. By utilizing on-chip transformer networks and adaptive load techniques, we observe improved efficiency over a wide input range in our proposed PA prototype. And to the author's knowledge, the prototype has the most efficiency recovery points among today's reported fully integrated CMOS PAs. The proposed PA is designed in a 0. 18 -um CMOS technology with 1. 8 -V supply voltage. The obtained linear output power and power gain are 22 -dBm and 8. 5 -dB, respectively, with Power Added Efficiency (PAE) of 12 % at 2. 4 -GHz.
