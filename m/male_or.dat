40|$|Based on a {{model of}} {{employee}} personal gender self-categorization, we examine the relationships between prejudicial attitudes and experiences of aggression in a male-dominated workplace.

Additionally, {{we found that the}} more anger experienced by employees who self-categorize either as <b>males</b> <b>or</b> females, the stronger their female prejudicial attitudes. In contrast, we found that contempt was negatively associated with female prejudicial attitudes; that is, the more contempt experienced by employees who self-categorize either as <b>males</b> <b>or</b> females, the weaker their female prejudicial attitudes...|$|R

Many species have separate sexes, the whole colony being either <b>male</b> <b>or</b> female, but others are hermaphroditic, with individual polyps having {{both male and female}} gonads. Some species brood their eggs but in most species, sexual reproduction results in the production of a free-swimming planula larva that eventually settles on the seabed to undergo metamorphosis into a polyp. In colonial species, this initial polyp then repeatedly divides asexually, to give rise to the entire colony.|$|E

Once a bird lands close to its partner, the male bends towards the female and wipes its bill. The male then sings with movements of the body. The female invites mounting with tail quivering.|$|E
