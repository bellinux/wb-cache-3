However, enhancing vegetable farmers to reach markets and actively engage in the markets is a key challenge influencing vegetable production in Swaziland. The perishable nature of vegetables necessitates effective <b>marketing</b> <b>channels.</b> The aim of this paper was to investigate factors affecting farmers’ choice of <b>marketing</b> <b>channels</b> using survey data gathered during the 2011 production season. Data were collected from 100 randomly selected vegetable farmers. Descriptive and multinomial logistic regression analyses were used. The results indicated that age of the farmer, quantity of baby corn produced and level of education were significant predictors of the choice to sell vegetables to NAMBoard <b>market</b> <b>channel</b> instead of selling to other-wholesale <b>market</b> <b>channel.</b> The age of the farmer, distance from production area to market, membership in farmer organization and marketing agreement were significant determinants of the choice to use non-wholesale <b>market</b> <b>channel</b> over other-wholesale <b>market</b> <b>channel.</b> It is therefore important to promote collective action as an institutional vehicle for linking farmers to agribusiness supply chains.
