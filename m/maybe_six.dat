500|$|In January 2013, Joss Whedon {{deflected}} {{any direct}} influences from other series, {{such as the}} efforts of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in The X-Files, and explained that while the show would involve people with powers and the spectacle of science-fiction storytelling, it would focus on [...] "the peripheral people...the people {{on the edges of}} the grand adventures." [...] As the series began to introduce more powered individuals, Bell noted that audiences [...] "seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that." [...] Jed Whedon stated that the series would continue to emphasize the general public's response to powered people, saying, [...] "The dynamic in the world has changed. There was one person with powers, and then by The Avengers there were <b>maybe</b> <b>six</b> total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that." ...|$|E
500|$|Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter met in 1987 while {{attending}} the Lycée Carnot, a secondary school in Paris. The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with {{others from the}} school. This {{eventually led to the}} formation of a guitar-based group called Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz was brought on board after the two sought an additional guitarist. The trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition. Stereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom. Bangalter felt that [...] "The rock n' roll thing we did was pretty average, I think. It was so brief, <b>maybe</b> <b>six</b> months, four songs and two gigs and that was it." [...] A negative review in Melody Maker by Dave Jennings subsequently dubbed the music [...] "a [...] punky thrash." [...] Instead of dismissing the review, they found it amusing. As Homem-Christo stated, [...] "We struggled so long to find [...] Darlin', and this happened so quickly." [...] Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix. Bangalter and Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesisers.|$|E

[...] was one that they wanted to answer in the fourth season. Tancharoen called the Inhumans [...] "a permanent part of our universe now", with Whedon adding, [...] "we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explore the metaphors of {{what it is like to}} be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] With the Inhumans film being removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, the series had [...] "a little more freedom" [...] and were [...] "able to do a little bit more" [...] with the species, including the potential of introducing some of the [...] "classic" [...] Inhumans, though the series would focus less on Inhumans than the third season which saw [...] "a real significant Inhuman agenda story". It was not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. On the evolution of S.H.I.E.L.D. to featuring so many powered characters, Whedon said [...] "the dynamic in the world has changed. There was one person with powers, and then by The Avengers there were <b>maybe</b> <b>six</b> total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that." ...|$|E

Duterte told reporters that he wanted [...] "a little extension of <b>maybe</b> another <b>six</b> months" [...] in the Drug War, as {{there were so many}} drug offenders and criminals that he [...] "cannot kill them all".On the following day, a convicted bank robber and two former prison officials testified that they had paid bribes to de Lima.

2500|$|GameSpy's Brian Altano and Brian Miggels named its ending {{as one of}} {{the worst}} ever, criticizing it for showing Bowser crying. Fellow GameSpy editor Mike Drucker called it [...] "half-assed." [...] GamesRadar commented that those who like this game may like , which they gave a {{negative}} review to. They later suggested that it was an unpopular game, commenting that [...] "five, <b>maybe</b> <b>six</b> people played the NES version of Mario's Time Machine". ABC Good Game called it [...] "awful", and was [...] "way too complicated for any school-aged youngster to understand." [...] Nintendo of Canada included a sealed copy of the NES version as part of a charity auction along with several other sealed NES games. In the book Video Games: A Guide for Savvy Parents, author David Sheff found the educational elements good, but criticized the gameplay. Andy Slaven, author of the book Video Game Bible, 1985-2002, accused the game of ripping off Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?, also noting that though it is not a bad game, it is not a good educational one.|$|E
2500|$|Often {{referred}} to with the accompanying parenthetical title [...] "(Krishna, Where Are You?)", [...] "I Am Missing You" [...] {{is a love}} song dedicated to the Hindu god Krishna. In the choruses, Shankar's words mourn the apparent absence of Krishna from his life, but in the repeated verses he acknowledges: [...] "Though I can't see you / I hear your flute all the while." [...] The latter line reflects {{the importance of the}} flute – or bansuri – in the Hindu tradition, since it is the musical instrument most commonly associated with the deity. In his second autobiography, Raga Mala (1997), Shankar describes the words as [...] "a simple lyric that just gushed out of me when I was travelling on a plane". Speaking to journalist Graham Reid in 1998, Shankar recalled: [...] "I think we were travelling somewhere in the States … it was very short, <b>maybe</b> <b>six</b> or eight lines. It came very spontaneously with the tune and I noted it down." [...] In addition to the lyrics being in English rather than Hindi or Bengali, the latter being Shankar's first language, the song's melody follows Western convention, with distinct chord changes instead of the single-chord, monodic drone common to Indian music.|$|E
