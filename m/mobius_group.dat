25|$|Since ℤ ⊂ ℝ ⊂ ℂ, the {{automorphism}} group PGL(2, R) {{lies between}} the modular group PGL(2, Z) and the <b>Möbius</b> <b>group</b> PGL(2, C).|$|E
25|$|In summary, {{the action}} of the {{restricted}} Lorentz group SO+(1,3) agrees with that of the <b>Möbius</b> <b>group</b> PSL(2,C). This motivates the following definition. In dimension n≥2, the <b>Möbius</b> <b>group</b> Möb(n) is the group of all orientation-preserving conformal isometries of the round sphere S'n to itself. By realizing the conformal sphere as the space of future-pointing rays of the null cone in the Minkowski space R1,n+1, there is an isomorphism of Möb(n) with the restricted Lorentz group SO+(1,n+1) of Lorentz transformations with positive determinant, preserving the direction of time.|$|E

25|$|The Möbius transformations are the {{projective}} {{transformations of}} the complex projective line.

25|$|In physics, the {{identity}} {{component of the}} Lorentz group acts on the celestial sphere {{in the same way}} that the <b>Möbius</b> <b>group</b> acts on the Riemann sphere. In fact, these two groups are isomorphic. An observer who accelerates to relativistic velocities will see the pattern of constellations as seen near the Earth continuously transform according to infinitesimal Möbius transformations. This observation is often taken as the starting point of twistor theory.|$|E
25|$|These {{groups also}} have a direct {{physical}} interpretation: As pointed out by Harry Bateman, the Lie sphere transformations are identical with the spherical wave transformations that leave the form of Maxwell's equations invariant. In addition, Élie Cartan, Henri Poincaré and Wilhelm Blaschke {{pointed out that the}} Laguerre group is simply isomorphic to the Lorentz group of special relativity (see Laguerre group isomorphic to Lorentz group). Eventually, there is also an isomorphism between the <b>Möbius</b> <b>group</b> and the Lorentz group (see Möbius group#Lorentz transformation).|$|E
25|$|An {{isomorphism}} of the <b>Möbius</b> <b>group</b> {{with the}} Lorentz group was noted by several authors: Based on previous work of Felix Klein (1893, 1897) on automorphic functions related to hyperbolic geometry and Möbius geometry, Gustav Herglotz (1909) showed that hyperbolic motions (i.e. isometric automorphisms of a hyperbolic space) transforming the unit sphere into itself correspond to Lorentz transformations, by which Herglotz {{was able to}} classify the one-parameter Lorentz transformations into loxodromic, elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic groups.

40|$|AbstractThe {{introduction}} of the gyration notion into nonassociative algebra, hyperbolic geometry, and relatively physics is motivated in this article {{by the emergence of}} the gyrogroup notion in the theory of the <b>Möbius</b> transformation <b>group</b> of the complex open unit disc. It suggests the prefix “gyro” that we use to emphasize analogies. Thus, for instance, gyrogroups are classified into gyrocommutative and nongyrocommutative gyrogroups in full analogy with the classification of groups into commutative and noncommutative groups. The road from the Thomas precession of the special theory of relativity to the Thomas gyration as well as the resulting new theory is presented in the author's book: Beyond the Einstein Addition Law and its Gyroscopic Thomas Precession: The Theory of Gyrogroups and Gyrovector Spaces [1]. The main result of this article is a theorem that allows the validity of some gyration identities to be extended from gyrocommutative gyrogroups into gyrogroups that need not be gyrocommutative. To {{set the stage for the}} main result, the <b>Möbius</b> disc-transformation <b>group</b> is studied in a novel way that suggests the notion of the gyrogroup and its gyrations...|$|R
50|$|From 2003 to 2007, the <b>Mobius</b> Artists <b>Group</b> was itinerant.

While there was some benefit in discovering different places for the development of artwork, the hunt for space and negotiation of terms precluded long-term planning efforts.|$|R
25|$|Another {{example is}} {{obtained}} by replacing the planes, as model surfaces, by spheres, which are homogeneous under the <b>Möbius</b> <b>group</b> of conformal transformations. There {{is no longer}} a unique sphere tangent to a smooth surface S at each point, since the radius of the sphere is undetermined. This can be fixed by supposing that the sphere has the same mean curvature as S at the point of contact. Such spheres can again be rolled along curves on S, and this equips S with another type of Cartan connection called a conformal connection.|$|E
