2500|$|The {{story of}} de Molay's brave {{defiance}} of his inquisitors has been incorporated {{in various forms}} into Masonic lore; most notably {{in the form of}} a youth group for young men aged 12 to 21, sponsored by Freemasonry, and named after the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar. DeMolay International, also known as [...] "The Order of DeMolay," [...] was founded in Kansas City in 1919 by Freemason Frank S. Land. Similar to what happens in Freemasonry, new members are ceremoniously initiated using [...] "degrees" [...] that are part of the Order's secret ritual, authored, in the case of the Order of DeMolay's ritual, by Frank A. Marshall at founder Land's request in 1919. The first, and less dramatic, of the two degrees is called [...] "the Initiatory Degree", wherein initiates are escorted around the meeting room and instructed in the precepts and Seven Cardinal Virtues of the Order. The second of the two degrees, known as [...] "the DeMolay Degree," [...] which, along with the Initiatory Degree, <b>members</b> <b>and</b> <b>observers</b> are sworn to keep secret, dramatically recreates the trial, [...] "before a Commission in its Council Chamber," [...] of the historic characters named in the ritual as [...] "Jacques DeMolay and his three preceptors, Geoffroi de Charney, Godfrey de Goneville, and Hughes de Peralde." [...] The DeMolay Degree, in which players dress in robes and other period costume, and appear on a dimly-lit stage whereupon they dramatically deliver memorized lines prescribed in the ritual, is described therein as depicting [...] "the tragic climax in the career of Jacques DeMolay, the hero and martyr who is the exemplar of our Order." [...] The stage instructions include that [...] "he foremost point to be remembered is to portray Jacques DeMolay as the hero and to select an interpretation for the DeMolay Degree which will enhance the lessons of fidelity and toleration." [...] The drama concludes with the commission condemning the four to life imprisonment; however, according to the ritual, [...] "so incensed was the king at the noble defiance and defense of DeMolay and Geoffroi de Charney that he overrode the Commission’s verdict and hurried DeMolay and de Charney to the stake on an island near the Cathedral, where they were barbarously burned." ...|$|E
