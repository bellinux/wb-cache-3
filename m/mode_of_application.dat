50|$|A new, {{effective}} and economical concept in pheromone delivery using a flowable formulation to create long lasting monolithic pheromone dispensers {{has been brought}} to the market in the past decade. These novel SPLAT pheromone mating disruption formulations can provide effective season long suppression effect (e.g., depending on the target pest a single application of SPLAT controls the target pest for a complete reproductive cycle, or for the entire season) and can be manually or mechanically applied. Although mechanical dispersal techniques require specialized off-the-shelf application technology and/or equipment, once the application system is made to work it allows protection of extensive areas using pheromones, one of the most benign and effective pest management techniques available today. A benefit of SPLAT is that the dollop anchors where it lands, avoiding unwanted drift of the formulation once applied in the field, and, depending on the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>application,</b> the cured dollops are retrievable.|$|E

40|$|Background: Tungiasis (sand flea disease) {{is caused}} by the {{penetration}} of female sand fleas (Tunga penetrans, Siphonaptera) into the skin. It belongs to the neglected tropical diseases and is prevalent in South America, the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa. Tungiasis predominantly affects marginalized populations and resource-poor communities in both urban and rural areas. In the endemic areas, patients {{do not have access to}} an effective and safe treatment. A proof-of-principle study in rural Kenya has shown that the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> a two-component dimeticone (NYDA®) which is a mixture of two low viscosity silicone oils caused almost 80 % of the embedded sand fleas to lose their viability within 7 days. Methods: In this study we compared the efficacy <b>of</b> two distinct <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> NYDA®; one targeted application to the area where the parasite protrudes through the skin and one comprehensive application to the whole foot. Results: Independent <b>of</b> the two <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>application,</b> the dimeticone caused more than 95 % of embedded sand fleas to lose all signs of viability within 7 days. The targeted application killed embedded sand fleas more rapidly compared to when the whole foot was covered. The proportion of viable lesions at day two were 7. 0 versus 23. 4 % (p < 0. 01) and at day five 3. 9 versus 12. 5 % (p < 0. 02).

This in vitro study evaluated the efficacy <b>of</b> two <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> (double <b>application</b> or placement <b>of</b> a hydrophobic resin coating) for the reduction of microleakage, using three different one-step self-etch adhesives (AdheSE One VivaPen, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein; Xeno V, Dentsply De Trey, Konstanz, Germany; OptiBond All-In-One, Kerr Italia S. r. l, Scafati, Italy). Materials and methods: We prepared Class V cavities with the occlusal margin in enamel and gingival margin in dentin on both buccal and lingual surfaces of 108 human molar teeth. Cavities were divided into nine groups according to the combination <b>of</b> adhesives and <b>application</b> <b>modes</b> used (n =  24). For applying adhesives, we followed three types of procedures: (1)  according to the manufacturers’ directions; (2) using a double-application method; and (3) with the additional placement of a hydrophobic resin layer after following the manufacturers’ directions. We restored the cavities with a composite resin. After thermocycling (500 cycles at 5 °C/ 55 °C) and immersion in 0. 5 % basic fuchsin, we sectioned the teeth and evaluated them for microleakage using a stereo microscope (20 ×). Enamel and dentin margins were scored separately, and we analyzed the data using Kruskal–Wallis, Bonferroni-corrected Mann–Whitney U, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Results: <b>Application</b> <b>of</b> a hydrophobic resin over the cured Xeno V adhesive decreased the amount of microleakage at the enamel margins, compared with the application according to the manufacturer’s instructions (P =  0. 005). Both application modes decreased the amount of microleakage at the dentin margins with AdheSE One VivaPen adhesive, compared with application according to the manufacturer’s instructions (P <  0. 001). With the OptiBond All-In-One adhesive, {{no significant difference between}} application modes was observed. Conclusion: Alternative <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> did not adversely affect the sealing ability of one-step self-etch adhesives. Depending on the type <b>of</b> adhesive, alternative <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> may contribute to low microleakage values...|$|R
