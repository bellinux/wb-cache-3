40|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> {{often lead}} to {{temporary}} increases in vessel traffic, which, {{in addition to the}} construction activity itself, contribute to underwater ambient noise in the affected area and increase the risk of vessel collision for marine mammals. Using a 3 yr data set of cliff-based observations, we investigated whether the presence/absence of minke whales, bottlenose dolphins and grey seals varied with the overall number and type of vessels present during the construction of an underwater gas pipeline through a bay on the northwest coast of Ireland. Results from binary generalised estimation equations showed a positive relationship between the presence of bottlenose dolphins and the overall number of boats, as well as the number of construction vessels. However, the presence of the 2 taxa with higher hearing sensitivity at low frequencies—minke whales and grey seals—was negatively correlated with the total number of boats and the number of utility vessels (as well as the number of fishing boats in the case of minke whales). While bottlenose dolphins may have been attracted to either the vessels per se or high prey concentrations coinciding with construction activities, both minke whales and grey seals appear to have been displaced by high levels of vessel traffic, most likely due to noise disturbance. Careful consideration of mitigation measures, especially for taxa with low-frequency hearing, is therefore essential in the planning phase of offshore construction activities, which should also take local circumstances into account...|$|E
40|$|The {{western waters}} of Hong Kong {{have long been}} {{subjected}} to pollution from the Pearl River flow, local discharges and contaminated sediment disposal facilities. An increasing number of major coastal development projects including the Hong Kong – Zhuhai – Macao Bridge, has posed a threat and further deteriorated the already poor water quality in the area. The cumulative water quality impact arisen from many concurrent developments is significant and {{beyond the scope of}} project-specific environmental impact assessment (EIA) and environmental monitoring and audit (EM&A). In order to provide a comprehensive picture of how the individual developments combined to affect western waters, this study reviewed the recent and future development studies and identified 18 major development projects which could affect water quality in western waters over a 20 -year period (2005 - 2024). A computer tool making use of Delft 3 D model was developed to input the collected data for assessing the cumulative water quality impact of on-going projects and predicting the impact of those in the pipeline. Three timeframes were chosen for this study: baseline condition (2005 - 2008), recent projects (2009 - 2015) and future projects (2016 - 2024). The baseline water quality before the intensive developments took place in the western waters was analyzed. The characteristics of the western body were found to have high concentrations of suspended solids (SS) and total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) with moderate dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. For the three recent projects under the Hong Kong – Zhuhai – Macao Bridge mega project, large sediment plumes were generated and frequently exceeded SS limits, resulting in a substantial decline in water quality. For future works to be carried out in 2016 - 2024, combined impacts from six reclamation projects and a dumping facility for contaminated mud were determined by the water quality model. During the construction phase, SS and other parameters were projected to be greatly elevated and the extent of sediment plume was immense when all projects are going at the same time. Thus, proper phasing of <b>marine</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> is recommended to minimise the cumulative water quality impact to avoid the adverse impact on human and marine life. During the operation phase of the projects, SS will largely return to normal but TIN will rise further and DO will decrease due to increase in population and activities. A more holistic and strategic planning, reducing pollutants from new projects as well as existing pollution sources, is therefore essential for improving the water quality of western waters. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|E
40|$|Brief {{introduction}} to the problem Risk management {{is one of the}} important management strategies that lead the success of major construction projects. Managing risks has become {{an important part of the}} management activities in construction industry. In Hong Kong, <b>marine</b> <b>construction</b> forms a major part of the construction business. In fact, it is appeared that <b>marine</b> <b>construction</b> exposes to serious risks in comparing to other types of <b>construction</b> <b>work,</b> which contributes the potential loss to both clients and contractors. There is a need for systematic risk management approaches that can help contractors for reducing and controlling risks thus to effectively improve project management. This paper focuses on contractor parties who <b>work</b> on <b>marine</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work,</b> and aims to identify critical risks and risk response techniques in managing marine projects. Questionnaire survey and structured interviews are conducted. It is found that “underwater conditions are different from tender assumptions” is the most common risk factor encountered in marine projects, “unavailability of materials, plant and labour” is the most impact to the project if risk is encountered. The most effective risk response technique to tickle risks encountered is “refer to previous experience”. Recommendations for improving risk management are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{decades have}} {{witnessed}} considerable {{developments in the}} field of integrated numerical models used for simulating dynamic processes in coastal areas, that can now provide quantitative support to decision makers for questions such as erosion and coastal vulnerability. Improvements in various theoretical formulations and an on-going increase in computing power (alongside the growing availability of long-term observations and numerical output from meteorological and sea-state models) allow the implementation of high-resolution and long-term applications. However, the efficient use of these numerical tools is a function of their capacity to describe a variety of physical processes that are ‘integrated’ amongst themselves correctly. Indeed, from the air-sea interface to the turbulent mixing of water masses and the water-sediment interaction, integrated numerical modelling has to face a series of scientific and practical challenges still open. Examples include the non-linear interaction of waves and currents, the problem of turbulence, the modelling of resuspension and sediment-transport processes, the role of longperiod waves in generating beach and dune erosion. Dealing with these using numerical models is necessary for a variety of reasons, from protecting the coast to search-and-rescue activities and support for <b>marine</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> of all types...|$|R
