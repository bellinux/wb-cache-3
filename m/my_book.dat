She was again interviewed by Diane Sawyer a few days before publication.|$|E
5|$|I wish {{to state}} that <b>my</b> <b>book,</b> Vier Jahre unter Kannibalen, {{contains}} a number of misrepresentations regarding my journeys in New Guinea. The book in question is a scientific report in part only; it is primarily a fictional account of my experiences in New Guinea and owes its origin to the unusual circumstances prevailing in Germany {{at the time of}} my return. Some of the journeys I had actually undertaken are not described at all; on the other hand it contains passages that do not correspond with the facts.|$|E
25|$|In this fourth Edition I {{have made}} no {{alterations}} of any kind. I now, however, find myself at liberty to acknowledge my very great obligations to Mr. HENRY HOP of Amsterdam. To that Gentleman I owe the most distinct, as well as liberal information, concerning a very interesting and important subject, the Bank of Amsterdam; of which no printed account had ever appeared to me satisfactory, or even intelligible. The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of <b>my</b> <b>Book.</b>|$|E

25|$|I will {{no longer}} {{participate}} in this transparent ploy to gather media attention for Finkelstein and his publisher. I answer all of his charges fully in Chapter 16 of my forthcoming book The Case For Peace, {{to be published by}} Wiley in August. <b>My</b> <b>book</b> deals with important and current issues, such as the prospects for peace in the immediate future. Finkelstein's deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and Palestinians are trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books. As far as I'm concerned, the public controversy is over and I will comment no further on the false charges leveled by Finkelstein and the UCP. Let them henceforth pay for their own publicity, instead of trying to get it on the cheap by launching phony attacks against me.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} <b>my</b> <b>book,</b> {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

500|$|Kaufman's wife Rose {{wrote the}} screenplay's first draft. It took her {{several years to}} complete; she found {{adapting}} the entire novel difficult. Some of the characters and stories from the novel were either changed or given retroactive continuity. Despite the differences, Richard Price approved of Kaufman's adaptation, saying, [...] "I love that picture. It's not <b>my</b> <b>book,</b> and I don't care. The spirit is right, and the way Phil Kaufman directed it showed me another {{way of looking at}} my own book." ...|$|E
500|$|When Wellington and the Tories {{fell from}} power in November 1830, Arbuthnot lost {{interest}} in her diary, writing: [...] "I shall write very seldom now, I dare say, in <b>my</b> <b>book,</b> for, except the Duke, none of the public men interest me." [...] Her account of the break-up of the Tory party is a thoroughly partisan narration, accurate as to happenings outside the Tory inner circle, but on a broader scale and not so completely political as that of Henry Hobhouse.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{titles of}} Masereel's first two wordless novels allude to religious works: 25 Images of a Man's Passion to the Passion of Christ, and <b>My</b> <b>Book</b> of Hours to the mediaeval devotional book of hours. [...] These religious books made {{frequent use of}} allegory, also prominent in Masereel's works—though Masereel replaces the religious archetypes of mediaeval morality plays with those from socialist ideology. [...] The book derives some of its visual vocabulary—framing, sequencing, and viewpoints—from silent film. [...] Thomas Mann named the book his favourite film.|$|E

500|$|During {{the first}} years of marriage, they experimented with {{automatic}} writing; she contacted a variety of spirits and guides they called [...] "Instructors" [...] while in a trance. The spirits communicated a complex and esoteric system of philosophy and history, which the couple developed into an exposition using geometrical shapes: phases, cones, and gyres. Yeats devoted much time to preparing this material for publication as A Vision (1925). In 1924, he wrote to his publisher T. Werner Laurie admitting: [...] "I dare say I delude myself in thinking this book <b>my</b> <b>book</b> of books".|$|E

[...] Bushman wrote in 2007 that Brodie had [...] "shaped {{the view of the}} Prophet for half a century. Nothing we have written has challenged her domination.
