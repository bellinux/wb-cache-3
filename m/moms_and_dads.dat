5000|$|Along with Exodus and Testament, Overkill {{has been}} the subject of which thrash metal band should be {{included}} in an expanded [...] "Big Four".

When thrash metal became harder in the '90s with grunge music, we never had a question about if we would stop doing it and go work for our <b>moms</b> <b>and</b> <b>dads</b> or something. We just needed to make it happen. We weren't going to let grunge stop us. And if it did, we'd just go back to the underground. I liked it there anyway!" [...] Commenting on the fact that Overkill never became part of the [...] "Big Four", Ellsworth stated, [...] "When it comes to being selected and not selected, that's a simple accounting issue. When you talk numbers, numbers make the world go around, numbers put food on your table, and numbers put the 'Big Four' in arenas. And they sell enough records to do that. For me, it's not a concern. To even be asked the question from you is quite a compliment with regard to, let's say, our longevity or tenacity doing what we like doing. But this is quite simply an accounting issue. He who sells the most gets the pole positions." ...|$|E
