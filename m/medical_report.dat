An army <b>medical</b> <b>report</b> from 23 November 1918 {{noted that he}} had gunshot wounds in the left shoulder, back, and left leg, and had suffered gas poisoning. The report stated that his general health was 'good' but that he complained of coughing upon exertion. It recognised that Sing's disability {{were the result of}} service, was permanent, and recommended that he be discharged as permanently unfit for service. Following his departure from the army, he briefly turned his hand to sheep farming, but the land he was given was of poor quality. He then worked as a gold miner.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> {{do not use}} {{standardized}} terminology {{and often}} bring insufficient information for statistical processing and medical decision making. Objectives of the paper are to propose a method for measuring diversity in <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> written in any language, to compare diversities in narrative and structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and to map attributes and terms to selected classification systems. Methods A new method based on a general concept of f-diversity is proposed for measuring diversity of <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> in any language. The method is based on categorized attributes recorded in narrative or structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and on international classification systems. Values of categories are expressed by terms. Using SNOMED CT and ICD 10 we are mapping attributes and terms to predefined codes. We use f-diversities of Gini-Simpson and Number of Categories types to compare diversities of narrative and structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports.</b> The comparison is based on attributes selected from the Minimal Data Model for Cardiology (MDMC). Results We compared diversities of 110 Czech narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and 1119 Czech structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports.</b> Selected categorized attributes of MDMC had mostly different numbers of categories and used different terms in narrative and structured reports. We found more than 60 % of MDMC attributes in SNOMED CT. We showed that attributes in narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> had greater diversity than the same attributes in structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports.</b> Further, we replaced each value of category (term) used for attributes in narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> by the closest term and the category used in MDMC for structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports.</b> We found that relative Gini-Simpson diversities in structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> were significantly smaller than those in narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> except the "Allergy" attribute. Conclusions Terminology in narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> is not standardized. Therefore {{it is nearly impossible}} to map values of attributes (terms) to codes of known classification systems. A high diversity in narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> terminology leads to more difficult computer processing than in structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and some information may be lost during this process. Setting a standardized terminology would help healthcare providers to have complete and easily accessible information about patients that would result in better healthcare. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the dissertation thesis has been the information-lexical analysis of Czech <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and the usability of international classification systems in the Czech healthcare environment. The analysis of <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> {{has been based on}} the attributes of the Minimal Data Model for Cardiology (MDMC). Narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> from the ADAMEK software application have been used. For the thesis SNOMED CT and ICD- 10 classification systems have been used. There has been compared how well attributes of MDMC are recorded in narrative and structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports.</b> The language analysis of the Czech narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> has been made. A new application for measuring diversity in <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> written in any language is proposed. The application is based on the general concepts of diversities derived from f-diversity, relative f- diversity, self f-diversity and marginal f-diversity. The thesis has {{come to the conclusion that}} using a free text in <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> is not consistent and not standardized. The standardized terminology would bring benefits to physicians, patients, administrators, software developers and payers and it would help healthcare providers as it could provide complete and easily accessible information that belongs to the process of [...] ...|$|R
5|$|On 19 August 2002, the Palestinian {{newspaper}} al-Ayyam {{reported that}} Abu Nidal had died three days earlier of multiple gunshot wounds {{at his home}} in Baghdad, a house the newspaper said was owned by the Mukhabarat, the Iraqi secret service. Two days later Iraq's chief of intelligence, Taher Jalil Habbush, handed out photographs of Abu Nidal's body to journalists, along with a <b>medical</b> <b>report</b> that said he had died after a bullet entered his mouth and exited through his skull. Habbush said Iraqi officials had arrived at Abu Nidal's home to arrest him on suspicion of conspiring with foreign governments. After saying he needed a change of clothes, he went into his bedroom and shot himself in the mouth, according to Habbush. He died eight hours later in hospital.|$|E

In the last two decades, Berrios has reported case studies in 1990 and 1991 along with Keshavan et al. in 1992. Berrios concluded that confirmed diagnoses of deafness, ear disease, brain disease, advanced age and drug use are all important factors in the development of musical hallucinations. After analyzing 46 cases, Berrios found a female predominance of 80% in women over the age of 60.

This documentation must happen in a timely manner and encompass each and every form of treatment the patient receives, as well as other necessary information, such as the patient’s case history, diagnoses, findings, treatment results, therapies and their effects, surgical interventions and their effects, as well as informed consents. The information must include virtually everything that is of functional importance for the actual, but also for future treatment. This documentation must also include the <b>medical</b> <b>report</b> and must be archived by the attending physician for at least 10 years. The law clearly states that these records are not only memory aids for the physicians, but also should be kept for the patient and must be presented on request.|$|E

The majority opinion was authored by Justice Antonin Scalia and joined by Justices Ginsburg, Kennedy, Sotomayor, and Kagan. [...] It first held that [...] "video games qualify for First Amendment protection": Justice Scalia then affirmed that, while states may pass laws to block obscene material from minors as previously decided in the 1968 Ginsberg v. New York case, [...] "speech about violence is not obscene," [...] and California's statute was unlawful. The decision pointed to fairy tales like those of the Brothers Grimm, which are regularly given to children to read, [...] "contain no shortage of gore" [...] that are also present in video games. The decision further compared video games to classical works like The Divine Comedy, stating that [...] "Even if we can see in them nothing of any possible value to society, they are as much entitled to the protection of free speech as the best of literature." [...] Scalia's decision also stated that the current self-moderated industry standards like the ESRB are operated effectively to regulate the sale of more mature games to minors, and that [...] "filling the remaining modest gap in concerned-parents' control can hardly be a compelling state interest" [...] requiring a law to enforce. [...] The Court's decision also determined that from the evidence, there was no [...] "compelling" [...] link between violent video games and its effects on children. The decision cited one <b>medical</b> <b>report</b> that asserted that cartoons like Looney Tunes generate the same effects in children as in games like Sonic the Hedgehog or imagery of guns.|$|E
