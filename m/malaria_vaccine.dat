5|$|Malaria {{vaccines}} {{have been}} an elusive goal of research. The first promising studies demonstrating {{the potential for a}} <b>malaria</b> <b>vaccine</b> were performed in 1967 by immunizing mice with live, radiation-attenuated sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites. Since the 1970s, there has been a considerable effort to develop similar vaccination strategies for humans. The first vaccine, called RTS,S, was approved by European regulators in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Between 1937 and 1938, Bishop {{studied the}} effects of various factors, {{including}} different substances in blood and different temperatures, on the feeding behaviour of the chicken malaria (Plasmodium gallinaceum) vector, Aedes aegypti. She also examined factors that contributed to Plasmodium reproduction. This work {{became the basis for}} subsequent ongoing research into a <b>malaria</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Her subsequent work was spurred by the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, she investigated alternative chemotherapies for malaria. Her research aided the British war effort because the most prevalent antimalarial, quinine, was difficult to obtain due to the Japanese occupation of the Dutch West Indies. From 1947 to 1964, she {{was in charge of the}} Institute's Chemotherapy Research Institute, associated with the Medical Research Council.|$|E

25|$|RTS,S is {{the only}} {{candidate}} as <b>malaria</b> <b>vaccine</b> to have gone through clinical trials.

25|$|During the 1970s, WHO {{had dropped}} its {{commitment}} to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained {{a strong commitment to}} malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. As of 2012 WHO was to report, as to whether RTS,S/AS01, were a viable <b>malaria</b> <b>vaccine.</b> For the time being, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and insecticide sprays are used {{to prevent the spread of}} malaria, as are antimalarial drugs – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children.|$|E
500|$|Remembered {{well for}} his turns of phrase and his puns, Wanderone once wrote, [...] "If you {{happened}} to drive from Mobile to Dowell [...] with a carload of pool hustlers, {{you would get}} bit so hard and so often that you would need a <b>malaria</b> <b>vaccine</b> and a new bankroll as well", a reference {{not only to the}} area's notorious mosquitos but also the predatory nature of hustlers. Wanderone is remembered for saying on his way out a pool room door, [...] "Boys, the only difference between me and everybody else is that everybody else drives around in a Volkswagen, and Minnesota Fats drives around in a Duesenberg." [...] Wanderone would go virtually anywhere to help promote the game, and he was a crowd-pleaser.|$|E

40|$|Infection of mice with sporozoites of Plasmodium berghei or Plasmodium yoelii {{has been}} used {{extensively}} to evaluate liver-stage protection by candidate preerythrocytic <b>malaria</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Unfortunately, repeated success of such vaccines in mice has not translated readily to effective <b>malaria</b> <b>vaccines</b> in humans. Thus, mice may be used better as models to dissect basic parameters required for immunity to Plasmodium-infection than as preclinical vaccine models. In turn, this basic information may aid in the rational design of <b>malaria</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Here, we describe a model of circumsporozoite-specific memory CD 8 T cell generation that protects mice against multiple P. berghei sporozoite challenges for at least 19 months. Using this model we defined a threshold frequency of memory CD 8 T cells in the blood that predicts long-term sterilizing immunity against liver-stage infection. Importantly, the number of Plasmodium-specific memory CD 8 T cells required for immunity greatly exceeds the number required for resistance to other pathogens. In addition, this model allowed us to identify readily individual immunized mice that exceed or fall below the protective threshold before infection, information that should greatly facilitate studies to dissect basic mechanisms of protective CD 8 T cell memory against liver-stage Plasmodium infection. Furthermore, the extremely large threshold in memory CD 8 T cell frequencies required for long-term protection in mice may {{have important implications for}} development of effective <b>malaria</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
500|$|Several notable {{attempts}} {{are being}} made to eliminate the parasite from sections of the world, or to eradicate it worldwide. In 2006, the organization Malaria No More set a public goal of eliminating malaria from Africa by 2015, and the organization plans to dissolve if that goal is accomplished. [...] Several malaria vaccines are in clinical trials, which are intended to provide protection for children in endemic areas and reduce the speed of transmission of the disease. , The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has distributed 230 million insecticide-treated nets intended to stop mosquito-borne transmission of malaria. The U.S.-based Clinton Foundation has worked to manage demand and stabilize prices in the artemisinin market. [...] Other efforts, such as the Malaria Atlas Project, focus on analysing climate and weather information required to accurately predict the spread of malaria based {{on the availability of}} habitat of malaria-carrying parasites. The Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) was formed in 2012, [...] "to provide strategic advice and technical input to WHO on all aspects of malaria control and elimination". [...] In November 2013, WHO and the <b>malaria</b> <b>vaccine</b> funders group set a goal to develop vaccines designed to interrupt malaria transmission with the long-term goal of malaria eradication.|$|E

40|$|Pre-erythrocytic <b>malaria</b> <b>vaccines,</b> {{including}} those based on whole-parasite approaches, have shown protective efficacy in animal and human studies. However few pre-erythocytic antigens {{other than the}} immunodominant circumsporozoite protein (CSP) have been studied in depth {{with the goal of}} developing potent subunit <b>malaria</b> <b>vaccines</b> that are suited for use in endemic areas. Here we describe a novel technique to identify pre-erythrocytic malaria antigens that contribute to protection elicited by whole-parasite vaccination in the mouse model. Our approach combines immunization with genetically attenuated parasites and challenge with DNA plasmids encoding for potential protective pre-erythrocytic malaria antigens as luciferase fusions by hydrodynamic tail vein injection. After optimizing the technique, we first showed that immunization with Pyfabb/f-, a P. yoelii genetically attenuated parasite, induces killing of CSP-presenting hepatocytes. Depletion of CD 8 + but not CD 4 + T cells diminished the killing of CSP-expressing hepatocytes, indicating that killing is CD 8 + T cell-dependent. Finally we showed that the use of heterologous prime/boost immunization strategies that use genetically attenuated parasites and DNA vaccines enabled the characterization of a novel pre-erythrocytic antigen, Tmp 21, as a contributor to Pyfabb/f- induced protection. This technique will be valuable for identification of potentially protective liver stage antigens and has the potential to contribute to the understanding of immunity elicited by whole parasite vaccination, as well as the development of effective subunit <b>malaria</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
