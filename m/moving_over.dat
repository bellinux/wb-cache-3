5|$|On July26, the typhoon turned {{towards the}} {{northwest}} and weakened somewhat. Late the next day, Judy struck {{the southern coast}} of Kyushu before <b>moving</b> <b>over</b> the Korea Strait. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of the island caused the storm to degenerate. Less than a day after <b>moving</b> <b>over</b> Kyushu, the system weakened to a tropical storm and soon made landfall in South Korea, roughly 205km (125mi) west of Pusan. Once onshore, rapid weakening took place with Judy being downgraded to a tropical depression within 12hours. The remnants of Judy were last noted on July29 over the Sea of Japan.|$|E
5|$|Adolph was {{the first}} {{depression}} of the season, forming on May 25; it became a hurricane three days later. After rapidly intensifying, Adolph became the most powerful storm in terms of maximum sustained winds this season, along with Hurricane Juliette.

5|$|Tropical Storm Thelma, {{known in}} the Philippines as Tropical Storm Uring, {{was one of the}} deadliest {{tropical}} cyclones in Philippine history, killing at least 5,081people. Forming out of a tropical disturbance on November1, 1991, several hundred kilometers north-northeast of Palau, the depression that would become Thelma tracked generally westward. After turning southwestward in response to a cold front, the system intensified into a tropical storm on November4 as it approached the Philippines. Hours before <b>moving</b> <b>over</b> the Visayas, Thelma attained its peak intensity with estimated ten-minute sustained winds of 75km/h (45mph) and a barometric pressure of 992mbar (hPa; 29.29inHg). Despite <b>moving</b> <b>over</b> land, the system weakened only slightly, emerging over the South China Sea on November6 while retaining gale-force winds. Thelma ultimately succumbed to wind shear and degraded to a tropical depression. On November8, the depression made landfall in Southern Vietnam before dissipating hours later.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm developed east of Nicaragua on May25, executing a counterclockwise loop over Central America. After weakening over land, Alice re-intensified over the western Caribbean, <b>moving</b> <b>over</b> western Cuba on May 21 with winds of 50mph (80km/h). On June1, it entered the Gulf of Mexico, and later executed another loop off the northwest coast of Cuba. Alice quickly weakened {{due to a}} cold front, and advisories were discontinued by June3. While near Cuba, Alice produced drought-breaking rainfall that caused flooding and several unofficial drowning deaths.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{north of}} Taiwan, Rananim made {{landfall}} at peak intensity around 1300UTC on August12, near Wenling in Zhejiang province in China. The China Meteorological Administration {{reported that the}} typhoon was the strongest to hit Zhejiang since Typhoon Sally in 1956. <b>Moving</b> <b>over</b> land, the typhoon quickly weakened to tropical storm status as it turned toward the west. Early on August13, the JMA downgraded Rananim to a tropical depression and issued the last warning; by that time, the circulation was over Jiangxi. The depression lasted another two days before dissipating over northwest Hunan.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>moving</b> <b>over</b> warm waters, Elida {{began to}} weaken because it began an eyewall {{replacement}} cycle. When the cycle ended, the cyclone was over cooler water and unsteadily weakened. Elida fell to {{a tropical storm}} on July 27, then degenerated into a remnant low {{and turned to the}} northeast. The remnant dissipated over the open ocean about 535mi (861km) west of Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 27, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} below tropical storm status and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while <b>moving</b> <b>over</b> cooler waters. The system dissipated shortly after over open waters. Although the storm remained over {{water for the}} duration of its existence, the outer reaches of the system brought rain and light winds to Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas. In Jacksonville, Florida, the storm produced 0.47 in (11.9 mm) of rain on August 25. Between August 26 and 27, Cape Hatteras received 2.06 in (52.3 mm) of rain from the storm.|$|E

5|$|In May and June 1953, {{an unusually}} {{long-lasting}} upper-level low persisted across Mexico and Central America. On May 25, a weak warm-core surface circulation developed east of Nicaragua. It {{moved around the}} upper-level low, bringing it to the northwest and later looping to the south through Honduras and Central America. The system weakened over land, but it re-intensified over the western Caribbean Sea, <b>moving</b> <b>over</b> western Cuba as a 50mph (80km/h) tropical storm on May 31. Advisories for Alice did not begin until June 1, when the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Ski wax {{enhances the}} ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is <b>moving</b> <b>over</b> the snow.|$|E

5|$|Slight {{weakening}} {{took place}} after <b>moving</b> <b>over</b> western Cuba; however, once over the Gulf of Mexico, the storm steadily regained its strength. By September19, the system re-attained the equivalent intensity of a Category2 hurricane and the forward motion increased. Early that morning, the storm further intensified to attain its peak winds of 120mph (195km/h), {{equivalent to a}} mid-range Category3 cyclone. By the afternoon of September19, reports from the Louisiana and Mississippi coastline indicated that the outer bands of the hurricane were producing scattered rainfall.|$|E

5|$|A {{disturbance}} possibly {{associated with}} a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on October 22. It strengthened into a tropical storm that same day and a hurricane on October 23. The next day, Kenna became the third Category5 hurricane of the season. A trough over Mexico recurved the hurricane, and it started accelerating towards Mexico. Despite <b>moving</b> <b>over</b> waters that were still warm, wind shear weakened the system to a minimal Category4 {{by the time of}} its landfall over Mexico late on October 25. Mountainous terrain rapidly weakened Kenna, and the system dissipated early on October 26.|$|E

5|$|A {{few hours}} {{prior to its}} development, outer rainbands from the {{depression}} began <b>moving</b> <b>over</b> portions of the Texas coast. Heavy rainfall from intense thunderstorms caused minor flooding as they crossed the coastline during the subsequent days; precipitation in the state peaked at 14.13inches (358.9mm) at East Bay Bayou, the highest recorded rainfall total {{in association with the}} hurricane. Sustained winds peaked at 69mph (112km/h) with gusts to 85mph (137km/h) at Sea Rim State Park; the National Weather Service estimates gusts exceeded 90mph (145km/h) in southwestern Jefferson County and extreme southeastern Chambers County. In the Golden Pass Ship Channel, an unofficial report of a 115mph (185km/h) wind gust was relayed to the National Hurricane Center. Upon moving ashore, Humberto produced a minor storm surge in the state, peaking at 2.86feet (0.87m) at Rollover Pass; the combination of surge and waves resulted in light beach erosion.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed in the northern Bay of Bengal on June 6 and developed into a depression the next day as it drifted to the north, <b>moving</b> <b>over</b> south of the Ganges Delta. The depression reversed its course overland, reemerging into the Bay of Bengal on June 8. Once over water, the depression intensified into a cyclonic storm {{on the morning of}} June 9. The cyclone's motion shifted to the northwest and it made a second landfall near Balasore in northern Orissa that night. The cyclone quickly weakened to a deep depression overland and tracked to the west over central India, where it degenerated into a broad area of {{low pressure}} on June 11.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa behind Hurricane Luis on August 31. Strong outflow from Luis prevented development of the wave, and it continued westward until crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 12. Convection increased as it moved through the Gulf of Tehuantepec, and the cloud pattern organized sufficiently to warrant Dvorak classifications for the system on September 15. Based on the development of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Eleven-E on September 16 while located around 290miles (465km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Due to the tropical depression <b>moving</b> <b>over</b> an area of warm water temperatures with favorable upper level outflow, the National Hurricane Center forecast the tropical depression to slowly intensify to 70mph (110km/h) winds within 72hours the forecast early on September 16.|$|E
