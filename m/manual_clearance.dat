AIMS Oesophageal clearance in endoscopy-negative heartburn was assessed to detect differences in bolus clearance time among patients sub-grouped according to impedance-pH findings. METHODS In 118 consecutive endoscopy-negative heartburn patients impedance-pH monitoring was performed off-therapy. Acid exposure time, number of refluxes, baseline impedance, post-reflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave index and both automated and <b>manual</b> bolus <b>clearance</b> time were calculated. Patients were sub-grouped into pH/impedance positive (abnormal acid exposure and/or number of refluxes) and pH/impedance negative (normal acid exposure {{and number of}} refluxes), the former further subdivided {{on the basis of}} abnormal/normal acid exposure time (pH+/-) and abnormal/normal number of refluxes (impedance+/-). RESULTS Poor correlation (r= 0. 35) between automated and <b>manual</b> bolus <b>clearance</b> time was found. <b>Manual</b> bolus <b>clearance</b> time progressively decreased from pH+/impedance+ (42. 6 s), pH+/impedance- (27. 1 s), pH-/impedance+ (17. 8 s) to pH-/impedance- (10. 8 s).

50|$|HALO has {{established}} a program in the West Bank funded by the US Department of State and the Dutch Government to conduct minefield survey, mine clearance and mine risk education. HALO will work {{under the auspices of}} the Israeli National Mine Action Authority (INMAA) and will also report to the Palestinian Mine Action Centre (PMAC). A systematic survey of the West Bank’s minefields conducted by HALO in the first half of 2012 has provided an accurate, up-to-date assessment of the extent of the mines problem that exists there. Survey will allow prioritization of the clearance of minefields with the highest impact on the local population. In 2013, HALO intends to recruit and train local manual deminers and mechanical plant operators to clear the minefields. HALO will use armored mechanical equipment where necessary to support the clearance of land unsuited to <b>manual</b> <b>clearance</b> techniques. HALO intends to use its extensive network of community and NGO contacts in the West Bank as the framework for an MRE program running in conjunction with clearance operations.|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy ofthe University of LutonThe best {{way of dealing with}} the restoration of chalk grassland encroached by scrub is unclear and the subject of many debates. The traditional method is to clear the scrub primarily by manual methods of cutting the scrub and after clearance the land is left to regenerate naturally. More recently the development of using livestock to browse and gradually reduce the scrub is thought to be an alternative. However the effectiveness of either of these methods (<b>Manual</b> <b>clearance</b> or Livestock browsing) is questioned by many and some believe that once scrub has encroached, the soils beneath this will become too enriched to be able to support a chalk grassland flora. This thesis aimed to provide a better understanding by undertaking a five year investigative trial of the two restoration methods and comparing and examining the ability of these to successfully restore a chalk grassland habitat. To undertake this both methods were trailed on scrub invaded chalk grassland and changes in vascular plants and invertebrates were monitored throughout trial period. Areas of nonintervention scrub were also included to act as controls. Successful restoration was assessed by comparing the results from the trials with measurable vascular plant restoration targets that were identified and set from known chalk grasslands in favourable condition. Soil fertility within the trial area was also examined to determine if the soils were considered to fertile to support a chalk grassland flora and costs and practicalities of using ether method were recorded throughout enabling these to be taken into account. The results showed that differences in both the species richness and composition of vascular plants and spider and beetles invertebrate species occurred. Soil fertility was found to suitable to support chalk grassland plants and vascular plants species were identified as moving away from those associated with scrub into those associated with chalk grasslands. It was observed however that on the areas trailed using <b>Manual</b> <b>clearance,</b> an initial flush of ruderal species occurred after clearance, it was therefore concluded that for <b>Manual</b> <b>clearance</b> to be successful continued restoration management is required if these species are to be controlled. It was also observed that the areas trailed using <b>Manual</b> <b>clearance</b> were moving towards successful restoration quicker those trailed using Livestock browsing thus indicating that the rate of change is more gradual using Livestock browsing. This rate of change was also found to occur within the invertebrate beetles and spider communities. Species richness within the spider communities however decreased on the areas manually cleared. Costs of using the restoration methods showed that the use of Livestock browsing was five times more costly that using <b>Manual</b> <b>clearance.</b> However it was found that majority of Livestock browsing costs incurred through welfare and husbandry of the stock. Restoration using <b>Manual</b> <b>clearance</b> also involved using livestock once scrub had been cleared however the costs of these were born by a local grazier and thus did not show as a cost of restoration. It was concluded that if a grazier is not found then these costs would be incurred. Overall it is concluded that both Livestock browsing and <b>Manual</b> <b>clearance</b> have the ability to successfully restore a chalk grassland community but that this must be viewed as a long term objective. Restoration management is critical to continue after clearance until restoration targets have been met...|$|E

40|$|Millions of antipersonnel landmines {{are left}} in the ground after past war conicts across many countries. Being {{functional}} for more than 50 years they provide a lot of humanitarian and economical problems long after the conict is _nished. Cleaning the existing mine_elds, called humanitarian demining, is {{required in order to}} return the large areas of the land to normal use and save the local civilians from the danger. Currently, the only fully trustable solution for this problem is the <b>manual</b> <b>clearance</b> which is itself a very dangerous and slow procedure. Automation of the humanitarian demining may change the situation providing a faster approach which eliminates the participation of humans on the mine_eld. This work {{is a part of the}} e_ort toward the development of such approach. Automation of the humanitarian demining meets a lot of technical problems which currently do not have e_ective solutions. This work covers the ones related to the automatic detection of antipersonnel landmines assisted by a mobile scanning platform which carries the landmine detection sensors. The landmine detection approach developed in this work assumes the employing of several nonselective sensors most widely used for landmine detection which include metal detectors, infrared sensors, and ground penetrating radar. The approach has a multi-stage structure and is based on feature-level sensor fusion strategy. This process is understood as a step-by-step reduction of the false alarm rate depending on the quality of the available sensor data. During the _rst stage the sensor data are processed in order to distinguish all objects suspected to be landmines against the background. For this purpose a novel online algorithm was developed. It allows to detect the object during the robot movement and is hardly sensitive to the quality of the sensor data. The consequent stages are performed in order to recognize the landmines among the detected suspicious objects. A number of new classi_cation features were developed in order to perform this recognition. Based on the feature analysis a concept of selective training specially suited for the landmine recognition task was developed. This technique allows to account for the high overlapping of the classes and multimodal distributions of the classi_cation features. Finally, a concept of dominant class was introduced in order to provide high levels of detection rates even in case of poorly separated classes. Being specially designed for the speci_cs of landmine detection the proposed algorithms allow to improve the results. In order to assist the gathering of the sensor data, the problems related to the effective sensor data gathering,path planning and localization of the platform are also addressed. The developed solutions are implemented on the previously created pneumatic scanning platform acting as a prototype demining robot. A number of practical solutions improving the platform localization were developed. The positioning of the robot is based on its odometry, compass and a novel vision system which are combined together by means of a Kalman _lter. The vision system employees a simple CCD camera and is guided by a novel algorithm for the detection and association of natural landmarks found on the ground surface. Finally, considering the landmine detection problem in the scale of mine_eld the problem of the _eld exploration is addressed. Assuming a general case in which the mine_eld may be populated with some obstacles in unknown positions an algorithm for online unknown area coverage was developed. The algorithm guarantees regularity of the robot path necessary for the mapping of sensor data and the safety of the robot by planning its path only inside already covered area. The developed algorithms were implemented in a form of control software for the real platform. Testing of the proposed ideas in simulation and in real conditions (on a test mine_eld) provided promising results showing the perspective of the developed concepts. Based on the experimental results the recommendations for future work are formulated. The automatic landmine detection task raises a number of challenging problems which have connections to other areas of robotics, pattern recognition and control. In this regards the development of the methods proposed in this work was considered in a more broad sense. Thus, the results of this work can be used in the adjacent _elds of robotics: automatic subsurface sensing with online reaction to the found target, pattern recognition in case of poorly distinguished classes, and online unknown area coverage required for cleaning, grass cutting, agriculture, etc. Tese de doutoramento em Engenharia Electrotécnica (Instrumentação e Controlo) apresentada à Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade de Coimbr...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} novel approach to virtual assembly that combines dynamic modeling with geometric constraint-based modeling to support low <b>clearance</b> <b>manual</b> assembly of CAD models.

Results that demonstrate the method give the user the ability to assemble parts without requiring extensive CAD preprocessing and without over constraining the user to arrive at predetermined final part orientations.

In this paper two silvopastoral treatments were evaluated over four sites from Chancaní and Los Medanitos, Pocho Department, Córdoba (Argentina); they were evaluated by applying <b>manual</b> selective <b>clearance</b> and closures (CD), comparing them with nearby sites without clearance and closure (CSD) and controls (T). Type and amount of forageable biomass, sprouts and trees were evaluated to define the baseline. Soil (0 - 15 cm) was sampled and the variables organic carbon (Corg), total nitrogen (Nt), C/N relation and nitrogen of nitrates (N-NO 3) were determined. A design of divided parcels was applied and, with the obtained data, a variance analysis was made, comparing between treatments. The results (three years of evaluation) showed higher forage productivity values in CD compared to CSD and T. The closure effect was evidenced also in the indicator species ratio and in the sprouting increment. In CD and CSD changes were evidenced in the pasture quality, rising the proportion of desirable species compared to Intermediate and undesirable species. Besides, the percentage of bare soil was reduced compared to T. Forestry regeneration increased in the deforested sites (CD), compared to CSD+T. The Corg, Nt y C/N analyzed variables did not show important variations depending on treatments and years. It is shown that in CD sites there is a rise (although not significant) in soil N-NO 3 values by the second year after the clearance was applied...|$|R

In order to assess the relative contribution of ET to parasite clearance in severe malaria, all patients receiving ET as an adjunct treatment to parenteral quinine or to artesunate were compared with patients treated with parenteral treatment with quinine or artesunate but who did not receive ET. ET was executed using a standardized manual isovolumetric exchange protocol. All patients in the Rotterdam Malaria Cohort treated for severe P. falciparum malaria at the Institute for Tropical Diseases of the Harbour Hospital between 1999 and 2011 were included in this retrospective follow-up study. Both a two-stage approach and a log-linear mixed model approach were used to estimate parasite clearance times (PCTs) in patients with imported malaria. Severe malaria was defined according to WHO criteria. A total of 87 patients with severe malaria was included; 61 received intravenous quinine, whereas 26 patients received intravenous artesunate. Thirty-nine patients received ET as an adjunct treatment to either quinine (n = 23) or artesunate (n = 16). Data from 84 of 87 patients were suitable for estimation of parasite clearance rates. PCTs were significantly shorter after administration of artesunate as compared with quinine.
