500|$|In June 1837 Chopin visited London incognito in {{the company}} of the piano {{manufacturer}} Camille Pleyel where he played at a musical soirée at the house of English piano maker James Broadwood. On his return to Paris, his association with Sand began in earnest, {{and by the end of}} June 1838 they had become lovers. Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me... I have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if I were a proud person I should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away..." [...] The two spent a miserable winter on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of Chopin and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover Félicien Mallefille. After discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional Catholic people of Majorca became inhospitable, making accommodation difficult to find. This compelled the group to take lodgings in a former Carthusian monastery in Valldemossa, which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather.|$|E

And I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> {{feel a little}} presumptuous to shoot for that. But that's the goal, like a hockey goal. I figure I've got a choice ... not of the outcome but of the objective. And my objective is that one performance." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was the Liberal Party that wooed Sauvé into politics, {{asking her}} to run as a {{candidate}} in the Montreal riding of Ahuntsic during the 1972 federal election. Though she found campaigning arduous, saying: [...] "I felt uneasy {{for the first time}} in my life when I was campaigning... I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> had qualms about it myself", Sauvé won, becoming one of five female MPs. She was subsequently both sworn into the Queen's Privy Council and appointed as Minister of State for Science and Technology in the Cabinet chaired by Pierre Trudeau, thus becoming the first woman from Quebec to become a minister of the Crown and the sole female in that Cabinet. Sauvé ran again in the election two years later, re-winning Ahuntsic, and was given the environment portfolio until 1975, when she was appointed Minister of Communications.|$|E

2500|$|I learned quite a {{lot from}} him, I <b>must</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> learned that {{you have got to}} work at it. You have to rehearse. When I came back and I got the band (Earth) back together, I made sure that {{everybody}} was up {{early in the morning and}} rehearsing. I used to go and pick them up. I was the only one at the time that could drive. I used to have to drive the bloody van and get them up at quarter to nine every morning; which was, believe me, early for us then. I said to them, [...] "This is how we have got to do it because this is how Jethro Tull did it." [...] They had a schedule and they knew that they were going to work from this time till that time. I tried that with our band and we got into doing it. It worked. Instead of just strolling in at any hour, it made it more like we were saying, [...] "Let’s do it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The duo had not {{expected}} to star in a film at this point of their careers, with Mitchell stating that [...] "it probably came much earlier than {{we thought we would}} do a film. [...] It landed very fortuitously on our doormat." [...] At first, Mitchell and Webb were not considered for the roles of Harry and Karl, but O'Connor changed his mind [...] "it became clear they could do these parts really well. [...] And we thought, well, wouldn't it be great to do our first movie with people we know, because we really admire and enjoy working with them". Unlike most other Mitchell and Webb projects, Olivia Colman does not have a main part in the film. O'Connor explained that [...] "Olivia was part of the development and did some read-throughs with us. [...] I guess our feeling was that because of the relationship between [...] and Olivia in Peep Show, to have taken that same relationship, {{it would have been a}} really weird thing for the audience. [...] I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> think she'd have been great in the part, she was great in the read-throughs, I just thought we couldn't have done that." [...] Mitchell admitted, the day before the film's release, that he [...] "really got into" [...] his role as Harry.|$|E

[...] "I really <b>must</b> <b>say,</b> Rover, <b>I</b> don't {{know what to make}} of it. Do you suspect anyone in particular of having taken it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas! that <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>say</b> it. <b>I</b> {{believe my}} son to be that basest of creatures, a fortune-hunter. How did he get that money left to him by another woman?" ...|$|R
