5|$|Based on its composition, it {{is assumed}} that the magma at Licancabur formed from the partial melting of the oceanic crust subducted at the Peru-Chile Trench after metamorphosis. This magma melted part of the mantle wedge above the subducting plate, <b>mixing</b> with the melt products. Further {{contamination}} by crustal Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite-like rocks from the Archean, crystal fractionation and magma <b>mixing</b> further up in the crust then yielded the Licancabur magmas. The younger lavas may have formed from the <b>mixing</b> of dacite with the magmas forming the older lavas. Some inclusions in Licancabur rocks seem to be from wall rocks of the magma chamber.|$|E

25|$|Vertical air <b>mixing</b> {{was invented}} by Erik Uppstu. His idea is to turn {{traditional}} vertical <b>mixing</b> to horizontal <b>mixing.</b> Closely spaced jets will form a flat plane. In traditional boilers this plane has been formed by secondary air. By placing the planes to 2/3 or 3/4 arrangement improved <b>mixing</b> results. Vertical air has a potential to reduce NOx as staging air helps in decreasing emissions. In vertical air <b>mixing,</b> primary air supply is arranged conventionally. Rest of the air ports are placed on interlacing 2/3 or 3/4 arrangement.|$|E

25|$|Separate paste <b>mixing</b> {{has shown}} that the <b>mixing</b> of cement and water into a paste before {{combining}} these materials with aggregates can increase the compressive strength of the resulting concrete. The paste is generally mixed in a high-speed, shear-type mixer at a w/cm (water to cement ratio) of 0.30 to 0.45 by mass. The cement paste premix may include admixtures such as accelerators or retarders, superplasticizers, pigments, or silica fume. The premixed paste is then blended with aggregates and any remaining batch water and final <b>mixing</b> is completed in conventional concrete <b>mixing</b> equipment.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{irreversible}} processes {{that result in}} an increase of the entropy. See: Entropy production. One of them is <b>mixing</b> {{of two or more}} different substances, occasioned by bringing them together by removing a wall that separates them, keeping the temperature and pressure constant. The <b>mixing</b> is accompanied by the entropy of <b>mixing.</b> In the important case of <b>mixing</b> of ideal gases, the combined system does not change its internal energy by work or heat transfer; the entropy increase is then entirely due to the spreading of the different substances into their new common volume.|$|E
25|$|The vacuum {{ultraviolet}} (VUV) band (100–200nm) can {{be generated}} by non-linear 4 wave <b>mixing</b> in gases by sum or difference frequency <b>mixing</b> of 2 or more longer wavelength lasers. The generation is generally done in gasses (e.g. krypton, hydrogen which are two-photon resonant near 193nm) or metal vapors (e.g. magnesium). By making one of the lasers tunable, the VUV can be tuned. If one of the lasers is resonant with a transition in the gas or vapor then the VUV production is intensified. However, resonances also generate wavelength dispersion, and thus the phase matching can limit the tunable range of the 4 wave <b>mixing.</b> Difference frequency <b>mixing</b> (lambda1 + lambda2 − lambda3) has an advantage over sum frequency <b>mixing</b> because the phase matching can provide greater tuning. In particular, difference frequency <b>mixing</b> two photons of an ArF (193nm) excimer laser with a tunable visible or near IR laser in hydrogen or krypton provides resonantly enhanced tunable VUV covering from 100nm to 200nm. Practically, the lack of suitable gas/vapor cell window materials above the lithium fluoride cut-off wavelength limit the tuning range to longer than about 110nm. Tunable VUV wavelengths down to 75 nm was achieved using window-free configurations.|$|E

The <b>mixed</b> adjacency matrix generalizes both the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph and the skew-adjacency matrix of a digraph.
