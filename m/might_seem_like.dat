25|$|To decide {{exactly where}} a new topic or thought begins within a biblical text {{involves}} {{a degree of}} subjectivity {{on the part of}} the reader. This subjective element may help explain differences amongst the various masoretic codices in some details of the section divisions (though their degree of conformity is high). It may also explain why certain verses which <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> introductions to a new topic lack a section division, or why such divisions sometimes appear in places where no new topic seems indicated. For this reason, the parashah divisions may at times contribute to biblical exegesis.|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "With arrangements that crest and {{fall to the}} point where a road map would have helped, the overlong (16-song) album is often unwieldy and could have benefited from judicious trimming." [...] Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "it <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> nothing more than heavy metal, but a closer listen reveals that Soundgarden haven't tempered their ambitions at all." [...] The reviewer for Melody Maker said that [...] "their roots don't matter now. All I care for now is the immediacy of their pop moments." [...] Critic Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention of one star, describing it as [...] "brutal depression simplified" [...] and highlighted by the songs [...] "Ty Cobb" [...] and [...] "Applebite", while Jason Josephes from Pitchfork Media called it a [...] "double shot of grunge, no foam but plenty of caffeine." ...|$|E

The British journalist Mark Urban wrote: [...] "To those looking at Gordon's actions now, the thanks of companies trading in opium or of a government that killed millions in its suppression of rebellion <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> the most poisonous endorsements.
