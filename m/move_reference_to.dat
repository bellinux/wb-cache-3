40|$|Measurements {{of actual}} {{supercomputer}} cache performance {{has not been}} previously undertaken. PFC-Sim is a program-driven event tracing facility that can simulate data cache performance of very long programs. PFC-Sim simulates cache concurrently with program execution, allowing very long traces to be used. Programs with traces in excess of 4 billion entries {{have been used to}} measure the performance of various cache structures. PFC-Sim was used to measure the cache performance of array references in a benchmark set of supercomputer applications, RiCEPS. Data cache hit ratios varied on average between 70 % for a 16 K cache and 91 % for a 256 K cache. Programs with very large working sets generate poor cache performance even with large caches. The hit ratios of individual <b>references</b> are measured <b>to</b> either 0 % or 100 %. By locating the references that miss, attempts to improve memory performance can focus on references where improvement is possible. The compiler can estimate the number of loop iterations which can execute without filling the cache, the overflow iteration. The overflow iteration combined with the dependence graph can be used to determine at each reference whether execution will result in hits or misses. Program transformation can be used to improve cache performance by reordering computation <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>references</b> <b>to</b> the same memory location closer together, thereby eliminating cache misses. Using the overflow iteration, the compiler can often do this transformation automatically. Standard blocking transformations cannot be used on many loop nests that contain transformation preventing dependences. Wavefront blocking allows any loop nest to be blocked, when the components of dependence vectors are bounded. When the cache misses cannot be eliminated, software prefetching can overlap the miss delays with computation. Software prefetching uses a special instruction to preload values into the cache. A cache load resembles a register load in structure, but does not block computation and only moves the address into cache where a later register load will be required. The compiler can inform the cache (on average) over 100 cycles before a load is required. Cache misses can be serviced in parallel with computation...|$|R
40|$|Questions {{about the}} nature of the {{relationship}} between language and extralinguistic cognition are old, but only recently has a new view emerged that allows for the systematic investigation of claims about linguistic structure, based on how it is understood or utilized outside of the language system. Our paper represents a case study for this interaction in the domain of event semantics. We adopt a transparency thesis about the relationship between linguistic structure and extralinguistic cognition, investigating whether different lexico-syntactic structures can differentially recruit the visual causal percept. A prominent analysis of causative verbs like <b>move</b> suggests <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> two distinct events and a causal relationship between them, whereas non-causative verbs like push do not so refer. In our study, we present English speakers with simple scenes that either do or do not support the perception of a causal link, and manipulate (between subjects) a one-sentence instruction for the evaluation of the scene. Preliminary results suggest that competent speakers of English are more likely to judge causative constructions than non-causative constructions as true of a scene where causal features are present in the scene. Implications for a new approach to the investigation of linguistic meanings and future directions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{reference procedure}} requires the Court of Justice {{to interpret the}} Treaty and national courts to apply that interpretation to the facts. However, often the Court gives such specific interpretations {{that the role of}} the national court is rendered trivial. This paper argues that two problems result. First, ‘which court decides’ is a question of competence allocation. A court with a quasi-constitutional nature has an obligation to respect this, even if it means self-denial. By crossing the line between functions the Court undermines its own status as neutral arbiter, and threatens the integrity of a Community where courts have an unusually powerful role. Second, infantilising national courts is bad for the effectiveness of Community law. Good regulation relies on them fully integrating that law into their practice, which the Court’s micro-management does not allow. The argument against this, the need for uniformity, is suggested to be short-term and self-defeating. Finally the paper looks for explanations of the Court’s approach in the civil and common law traditions of the Member States, before considering possibilities for competition between Court systems, and for a <b>move</b> from <b>references</b> <b>to</b> appeals. competences; European law; preliminary rulings; European Court of Justice; centralisation/decentralisation; national autonomy...|$|R

40|$|In {{drawing on}} recent {{advances}} in international and comparative political economy, this paper argues that diverging paths of institutional development among emerging market democracies are driven by the Transnational Integration Regimes (TIRs), in which a country is embedded. TIRs are more than trade agreements, aid projects, or harmonization systems and {{should be viewed as}} development programs. To date, research on the role of international factors shaping local instit- utional development has done little <b>to</b> <b>move</b> beyond <b>references</b> <b>to</b> markets and hegemonic hier- archies as the main mechanisms of change, compliance, and commitment. This work is largely based on a depoliticized view of institutional change, and overlooks the growing literature on the evolution of regulative capitalism and the diverse patterns of transnationalizing the modern state. By integrating this latter work into our analysis, we show how TIRs differ less in terms of their incentives and largess and more in terms of their emphasis on building institutional ca- pacities and ability to merge monitoring and learning at both the national and supranational levels.

The distinction between the exercise paradigm and landscapes of investigation is combined with a distinction between three different types of reference which might provide mathematical concepts and classroom activities with meaning: <b>references</b> <b>to</b> mathematics; <b>references</b> <b>to</b> a semi-reality; and <b>references</b> <b>to</b> a real-life situation. The six possible learning milieus are illustrated by examples.

Serving a mobile user automati-cally by sensing his/her locations in an indoor environment is {{considered as a}} challenge. However, indoor localization cannot be carried out effectively using the Global Posi-tioning System (GPS). In recent years, the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in locating a mobile object in an indoor environment has become popular.

40|$|A {{total of}} 57 {{standard}} specimens are prepared from 31 oriented core samples drilled from the Thung-Yai redbed of Upper Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous age. All specimens are characterized magnetically. Results show that distributions {{of the magnetic}} susceptibility (73. 5 - 144. 7 SI), natural remanent magnetization (3. 19 - 13. 59 mA/m) and Kenigsberger ratio (0. 96 - 3. 65) of the specimens {{are similar to those}} of the Khorat redbeds. Low anisotropy degree Pj of 1 - 7 % indicates a low degree of deformation in the Thung-Yai redbed. Distribution of the principal axes of susceptibility indicates an imbrication of the minimum axes (K 3) toward the West which is interpreted as the palaeo-current direction during deposition of sediments. There are probably gravitational and hydrodynamic forces of flowing water that affect the Thung-Yai redbed at the time of deposition. Analyses of magnetic data and fluorescent X-ray images indicate that magnetite and haematite are the predominant magnetic minerals in the Thung-Yai redbed. This shows a non-marine environment during sedimentation. Remanent magnetization derived from a high temperature range of 530 - 630 C directed at Dec/Inc = 32. 6 / 18. 8 is considered to be primary remanent magnetization and its pole position is at Plat/Plon = 57. 8 N/ 184. 6 E.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} project examines {{patterns of}} stance in essays written by high- and low-performing students in two upper-level undergraduate courses, one in political {{theory and the}} other in economics. It employs methods of linguistic discourse analysis, drawing largely on Appraisal Theory (a subset of Systemic Functional Linguistics), in combination with methods from corpus linguistics and theoretical insights from rhetorical genre studies. It examines how recurring patterns of stance in students' essays correspond to the goals and assessment criteria for writing in the courses, as revealed through interviews with the instructors and analysis of selected course material. Through this robust set of analytic approaches, the study aims to make explicit patterns of stance in student writing that correlate with high- and low-graded essays and with the disciplinary contexts. The broader aim is to render explicit patterns of interpersonal meanings constructed in students' texts that construe such abstract qualities as critical reasoning, complexity and nuance in argumentation, and control of the discourse—features identified by the instructors as valued in student writing. The study contributes to the field of composition and rhetoric by pinpointing discursive resources that enable some student writers to construct more discipline-congruent styles of argumentation than others. Specific findings show that, while the two essay assignments require different ways of using language to construct valued stances, the high-performing writers in both contexts more consistently construct a "novice academic" stance while the low-performing writers more consistently construct a "student" stance. The former is marked by the rhetorical qualities of contrastiveness, dialogic control, critical distance, and discoursal alignment, or assimilation of the disciplinary discourse. In contrast, the “student” stance is marked by frequent personalizing <b>moves,</b> repeated <b>references</b> <b>to</b> the classroom discourse, and comparatively infrequent use of discursive resources that construe the rhetorical qualities listed above. These findings have implications for instruction in writing in the disciplines (WID) contexts, specifically in terms of how instructors can refine their metalanguage about writing for discussing stance with students explicitly and in detail...|$|R
