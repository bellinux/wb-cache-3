We present {{a new way to}} combine <b>message</b> <b>modifications,</b> or auxiliary differentials, with the boomerang attack. We show that under some conditions, we can combine three independent paths instead of two for the classical boomerang attack. Our main result is obtained by applying this technique to round-reduced Skein- 256, for which we show a distinguisher on the keyed permutation with complexity only 2 57, and a distinguisher on the compression function with complexity 2 114.

40|$|Abstract. At Crypto 2007, Joux and Peyrin {{showed that}} the boomerang attack, a {{classical}} tool in block cipher cryptanalysis, can also be very useful when analyzing hash functions. They applied their new theoretical results to SHA- 1 and provided new improvements for the cryptanalysis of this algorithm. In this paper, we concentrate {{on the case of}} SHA- 0. First, we show that the previous perturbation vectors used in all known attacks are not optimal and we provide a new 2 -block one. The problem of the possible existence of <b>message</b> <b>modifications</b> for this vector is tackled by the utilization of auxiliary differentials from the boomerang attack, relatively simple to use. Finally, we are able to produce the best collision attack against SHA- 0 so far, with a measured complexity of 2 33, 6 hash function calls. Finding one collision for SHA- 0 takes us approximatively one hour of computation on an average PC. Key words: hash functions, SHA- 0, boomerang attack...|$|R

Submarine modification is an extension of the multi-message modification used in collision attacks on the MD-family.

In the case of parallel client-server algorithms, the LoPC analysis provides a simple and accurate calculation of the optimal allocation of nodes between clients and servers. The LoPC estimates for these applications are shown to be accurate when compared against event driven simulation and against a sparse matrix computation on the MIT Alewife multiprocessor. ...|$|R

We define a class of functions that closely model tampering of communication by adversaries who can eavesdrop on a constant fraction of the transmitted codeword, and use this information to select a vector of tampering functions that will be applied to a second constant fraction of codeword components (possibly overlapping with the first set). We derive rate bounds for non-malleable codes for this function class and give two modular constructions.

The second construction uses a new approach that results in an explicit construction of non-malleable codes.
