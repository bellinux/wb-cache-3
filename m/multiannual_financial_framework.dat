Prevails the view that, as in other areas, in the economy and the economic policy, there is also too much talk, promises, bureaucracy and distancing from the values/achievements of the Union, especially at a time when Europe was „a role model“ and Eu­ropeans were among “the happiest in the world“.

In the current <b>multiannual</b> <b>financial</b> exercise there are 7 SOP, plus the agriculture program. The absorption level of European funds for the current financial period - 2007 - 2013 - is low for several reasons: lack of strategic vision for programming development, poor quality of projects, excessive bureaucracy, lack of optimization of financial flows etc. For the upcoming 2014 - 2020 financial programming period, Romanian authorities and the European Commission will improve the absorption of EU funds.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to shed light on the main financial elements related to the last enlargement of the European Union (EU), which is the largest in its history. In their methodological assessment and analysis the authors identify the main financial impacts, in terms of trade flows, and also expenditures and contributions to the EU budget, while they make estimations for financing needs of main EU policies in the light of the next <b>financial</b> <b>framework.</b> Negotiations of the next <b>financial</b> <b>framework</b> for the EU, are going to be difficult, especially with ten new Member States joining in 2004. The authors are of the opinion that the financial pressures and also the need to sufficiently finance EU policies constitute the main factors which will determine the functions of the EU financial system in future. Enlargement poses also a severe challenge for EU structural and cohesion policies, the implications of which should be considered in designing the actions of the new <b>financial</b> <b>framework</b> from 2007 onwards...|$|R
50|$|The UK rebate (or UK correction) is a {{financial}} mechanism {{that reduces the}} United Kingdom's contribution to the EU budget in effect since 1985. It is a complex calculation which equates to approximately 66% of the UK's net contribution - the amount paid by the UK into the EU budget less EU expenditure in the UK. Based on a net contribution of €12.1 billion (£9.8 billion) in 2014, the UK Treasury estimates the 2015 rebate amounted to €6.2 billion (£4.9 billion), reducing the ultimate UK contribution for the 2015 budget to €16.6 billion (£12.9 billion). Although the rebate is not set in the EU treaties, it is negotiated {{as part of the}} <b>Multiannual</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Framework</b> (MFF) every seven years and must be unanimously agreed.|$|E

However this £50 billion bill includes the United Kingdom's annual EU contribution (approximately £13 billion annually) for the two years from 2020 and 2021 as agreed in the <b>Multiannual</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Framework</b> (MFF).
