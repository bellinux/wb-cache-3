During the race the Chief Track <b>Marshal's</b> role is running the radio “network” and communication with all other track <b>marshals</b> as “net control”.|$|R

50|$|Previously München-Laim <b>marshalling</b> yard (Rangierbahnhöfe) was {{along with}} Munich East <b>marshalling</b> yard one of Munich’s two <b>marshalling</b> yards.

As Deutsche Bahn required additional storage space for Intercity-Express trains, parts of the old rail yard were rebuilt and modernised. The trains enter these storage sidings via a connecting track from the Munich Hauptbahnhof depot.|$|R
5|$|Virgil Earp {{had served}} {{for three years}} during the Civil War and had also been {{involved}} in a police shooting in Prescott, Arizona Territory.

5|$|Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp (March 19, 1848– January 13, 1929) was an American Old West gambler, {{a deputy}} sheriff in Pima County, and deputy town <b>marshal</b> in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, {{who took part}} in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, during which lawmen killed three outlaw cowboys. He is often mistakenly {{regarded}} as the central figure in the shootout in Tombstone, although his brother Virgil was Tombstone city <b>marshal</b> and deputy U.S. <b>marshal</b> that day, and had far more experience as a sheriff, constable, <b>marshal,</b> and soldier in combat.|$|E

5|$|Wyatt outlived his brothers, {{and due to}} {{the fame}} Wyatt gained from Lake's {{biography}} and later adaptations of it, he is often mistakenly viewed as the central character and hero of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. In fact, Virgil Earp, as Deputy U.S. <b>Marshal</b> and Tombstone City <b>Marshal,</b> actually held the legal authority in Tombstone {{the day of the}} shootout. Virgil had considerably more experience with weapons and combat as a Union soldier in the Civil War, and in law enforcement as a sheriff, constable, and <b>marshal</b> than did Wyatt. As city <b>marshal,</b> Virgil made the decision to enforce a city ordinance prohibiting carrying weapons in town and to disarm the Cowboys. Wyatt was only a temporary assistant <b>marshal</b> to his brother.|$|E
5|$|A sejm {{began with}} a solemn mass, a {{verification}} of deputies mandates, and election of the <b>Marshal</b> of the Sejm (also known as the Speaker). (The position of the <b>Marshal</b> of the Sejm (and sejmik) {{who presided over the}} proceedings and was elected from the body of deputies evolved in the 17th century.) Next, the kanclerz (chancellor) declared the king's intentions to both chambers, who would then debate separately till the ending ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|After {{his brother}} Virgil was maimed in an ambush and Morgan was assassinated by hidden assailants, the men {{suspected}} of involvement were provided alibis by fellow Cowboys and released without trial. Wyatt {{and his brother}} Warren {{set out on a}} vendetta ride to locate and kill those they felt were responsible. Wyatt has been portrayed in a number of films and books as a fearless Western hero. He is often viewed as the central character and hero of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, at least in part because {{he was the only one}} who was not wounded or killed. In fact, his brother, Tombstone <b>Marshal</b> and Deputy U.S. <b>Marshal</b> Virgil Earp had considerably more experience with weapons and combat as a Union soldier in the Civil War, and in law enforcement as a sheriff, constable, and <b>marshal.</b> As city <b>marshal,</b> Virgil made the decision to disarm the Cowboys in Tombstone and requested Wyatt's assistance. But because Wyatt outlived Virgil and due to a creative biography, Wyatt Earp: Frontier <b>Marshal</b> published two years after Wyatt's death, Wyatt became famous and the subject of various movies, television shows, biographies and works of fiction.|$|E

By 1968, the New York City Civil Court Act's Article 16 made city <b>marshals</b> officers of the Civil Court of New York City, which allowed Appellate Divisions for the First and Second Judicial Departments of the court to supervise the <b>marshals.</b> While they were still appointed by the mayor of New York City, the Judicial Court could supervise and remove the appointed <b>marshals</b> from office.|$|R

Their presence on campus provoked riots at the university, but the <b>marshals</b> stood their ground, and Meredith registered. <b>Marshals</b> provided continuous protection to Meredith during his first year at Ole Miss, and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy later proudly displayed a deputy <b>marshal's</b> dented helmet in his office. U.S. <b>Marshals</b> also protected black schoolchildren integrating public schools in the South.

An ongoing conflict between Jones (now promoted air vice <b>marshal)</b> and Bostock led to moves in April 1943 {{to bring in}} an officer senior to both men to head the RAAF in a unified command structure, and Drummond was once more approached by the Australian Government. Drummond had indicated that {{he was happy to}} serve in Australia but the Air Ministry again refused to release him, having selected him for a posting to the Air Council as Air Member for Training.|$|E
