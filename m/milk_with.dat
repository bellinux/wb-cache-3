Many people still drink the traditional drink chaach (traditional Butter <b>milk)</b> <b>with</b> meals. On festive occasions, usually 'tava' (flat pan for roti) is considered inauspicious, and instead fried foods are consumed. A typical festive thali consists of Puri, Kachauri, sabji, pulav, papad, raita, salad and desserts (such as sewai or Kheer).|$|E

5|$|Many Jews observe kashrut partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or by not {{drinking}} <b>milk</b> <b>with</b> a meat dish. Some keep kosher at {{home but}} will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one {{analysis of the}} specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were Jewish. A sizable non-Jewish {{segment of the population}} views kosher certification as an indication of wholesomeness. Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the kosher-pareve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives. However, since kosher-pareve foods may contain honey, eggs, or fish, strict vegetarians cannot rely on the certification.|$|E
40|$|To test {{a system}} <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> flow-controlled pulsation, milk flow was {{recorded}} in 29 Holstein cows during machine milking. The three different treatments were routine milking (including a pre-stimulation of 50 - 70 s), <b>milking</b> <b>with</b> a minimum of teat preparation and <b>milking</b> <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> flow-controlled b-phase, i. e. with a gradually elongated b-phase of the pulsation cycle <b>with</b> increasing <b>milk</b> flow rate and shortening again during decreasing milk flow. For data evaluation the herd was divided into three groups based on the peak flow rate at routine milking (group 1 : 4 · 5 kg/min). Compared <b>with</b> routine <b>milking,</b> <b>milking</b> <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> flow-controlled b-phase caused a significant elevation of the peak flow rate and the duration of incline lasted longer especially in cows with a peak flow rate of > 3 · 2 kg/min in routine <b>milking.</b> In <b>milking</b> <b>with</b> a minimum of teat preparation the duration of incline lasted longer compared with the two other treatments. Bimodality of milk flow, i. e. delayed milk ejection {{at the start of}} milking, was most frequent at <b>milking</b> <b>with</b> a minimum of teat preparation. No significant differences between routine <b>milking</b> and <b>milking</b> <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> flow-controlled b-phase were detected for all other milking characteristics. In summary, <b>milking</b> <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> flow-controlled b-phase changes the course of milk removal, however mainly in cows with high peak flow rate...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} tension of teatcup liners on teat end {{condition}} {{and quantity of}} keratin in the teat canal was investigated. Liner tension was increased by using longer teatcup shells. The first experiment used six Holstein cows in early lactation Left quarters were <b>milked</b> <b>with</b> liners under medium or normal tension by using Conewango liners in 142 mm shells. Right quarters were <b>milked</b> <b>with</b> liners under high tension by mounting the liners in teatcup shells 149 mm in length. By day 16 test end condition and sensitivity to manipulation were worsened by thrice daily milking when liners were under a higher tension. Two subsequent experiments each used 12 different Holstein cows. These cows were in mid lactation and were milked tn ice daily for 10 or 30 d. Left quarters were <b>milked</b> <b>with</b> liners under high tension Right quarters were <b>milked</b> <b>with</b> liners under low tension by using teatcup shells 126 mm in length. The quantity of keratin removed during milking was not influenced by liner tension. however, the quantity of keratin {{at the end of}} the experiments was increased 10 - 20 % in teats that were milked using liners under a higher tension.

5|$|Most mysticetes reside at the poles. So, {{to prevent}} the unborn calf from dying of frostbite, they migrate to calving/mating grounds. They will then stay there for {{a matter of months}} until the calf has {{developed}} enough blubber to survive the bitter temperatures of the poles. Until then, the calves will feed on the mother's fatty <b>milk.</b> <b>With</b> the exception of the humpback whale, it is largely unknown when whales migrate. Most will travel from the Arctic or Antarctic into the tropics to mate, calve, and raise during the winter and spring; they will migrate back to the poles in the warmer summer months so the calf can continue growing while the mother can continue eating, as they fast in the breeding grounds. One exception to this is the southern right whale, which migrates to Patagonia and western New Zealand to calve; both are well out of the tropic zone.|$|E

40|$|Twenty-four Holstein cows, {{producing}} {{at least}} 21 kg of milk/d, {{were used in}} two replicate experiments {{to determine the effect}} of presence or absence of pulsation on loss of teat canal keratin during machine milking. Left quarters were milked without pulsation and right quarters were <b>milked</b> <b>with</b> pulsation. On d 0 and 10, keratin was collected from one left and from one right teat canal of each cow prior to milking and from the remaining two teat canals after milking. Milk was collected for assessment of SCC and bacteriological status on d 0 and approximately every 3 d until d 18. Quantity of keratin recovered before milking on d 10 did not differ between teats <b>milked</b> <b>with</b> or without pulsation, but loss of keratin because of milking was greater from teats <b>milked</b> <b>with</b> pulsation. By d 7, 30 % (12 of 43) of quarters milked without pulsation had become infected, but no (0 of 47) quarters <b>milked</b> <b>with</b> pulsation were infected. By d 14 to 16, new infections had increased to 68 % (28 of 41) of quarters milked without pulsation and 2 % (1 of 43) in quarters <b>milked</b> <b>with</b> pulsation; mean SCC in pulsationless quarters increased sevenfold relative to pulsation quarters. Protein and water content of keratin did not differ because of treatment, and changes in lipid composition were minor.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{the nature of the}} inhibition of milk secretion during a long milking interval, goats were treated in three possible ways: (i) milked twice daily at 08. 00 h and 16. 00 h or (ii) milked thrice daily at 00. 00 h, 08. 00 h and 16. 00 h, or (iii) milked thrice daily at 00. 00 h, 08. 00 h and 16. 00 h, but at 00. 00 h the milk removed was replaced with an equal volume of isosmotic sucrose solution. The latter treatment was carried out in order to subject the gland to a degree of physical distension equivalent to that on treatment (i). On either thrice-daily milking or thrice-daily <b>milking</b> <b>with</b> sucrose replacement, <b>milk</b> secretion rate over the 16. 00 - 08. 00 h period was significantly higher (by about 10 % in both cases) than on twice-daily milking. Secretion rates of lactose, milk protein, citrate and calcium during the 00. 00 - 08. 00 h period were similar on either thrice-daily milking or thrice-daily <b>milking</b> <b>with</b> sucrose replacement; the secretion rate of fat was significantly higher on thrice-daily <b>milking</b> <b>with</b> sucrose replacement. Secretion rates of Na+, K+ and Cl- were significantly higher on thrice-daily <b>milking</b> <b>with</b> sucrose replacement. In the case of Na+, the increased Na+ secretion rate was sufficient to create a normal Na+ concentration in the milk/sucrose mixture removed at the next milking. In the cases of K+ and Cl-, their secretion rates were not sufficient to restore their concentrations to normal by the next milking. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
