On May 4, Sheinberg sent Tiger a <b>mailgram</b> demanding that they send their game in for further approval. Universal reviewed it and decided that King Kong was too similar to Donkey Kong. On May 8, Steinberg revoked Tiger's license, but Tiger president O. R. Rissman refused to give in and challenged Universal's claim that it owned the King Kong name.|$|E

50|$|NCPAC's {{first major}} target was Democratic Senator Dick Clark of Iowa in the {{election}} of 1978. Three weeks before the November 1978 election, incumbent Clark had a 30 percentage-point lead in campaign polls, but he lost to Republican Roger Jepsen, 52 to 48 percent. Clark's defeat was attributed to intense anti-Clark campaigning conducted by direct mail, <b>mailgrams,</b> and leaflet distribution during the final weeks of the campaign, attacking Clark for his positions on abortion, gun control, and the Panama Canal Treaty. NCPAC took credit for Clark's defeat and was encouraged to expand its efforts in the 1980 election.|$|R
50|$|Westar 1 {{was used}} by Western Union for its own {{internal}} communications, such as for sending telegrams and <b>mailgrams</b> to Western Union bureaus and U.S. post offices respectively. It also was utilized by outside customers such as PBS, NPR and the Mutual Broadcasting System, using it for sending television and radio programming via satellite to their local affiliate stations throughout the 1970s and '80s. Westar 1 was also used {{for a short time}} by HBO for its nationwide debut using satellite distribution to cable companies in 1975 (HBO later moved to RCA's competing satellite, Satcom 1, in February 1976).|$|R
40|$|Em face da inexistência de dados sobre esquema de trabalho em turnos em empresas de Botucatu, solicitaram-se delas informações sobre ramo de atividade, número de funcionários e esquema de trabalho. Às que registraram tal ocorrência, enviou-se um questionário visando à caracterização da forma de organização da jornada de trabalho. Das 66 empresas participantes da pesquisa, 14 referiram a existência de trabalho em turnos, englobando 6. 541 funcionários, de um total de 9. 502, sendo 2. 346 de setores da produção. Nesses setores, os sistemas contínuo alternado e descontínuo permanente predominaram. em oito empresas os sistemas eram alternados, cinco delas com esquemas apresentando freqüência de revezamento de seis ou mais dias. São descritas outras formas de organização encontradas. Conclui-se que, com o quadro descrito, torna-se possível estudar as relações entre trabalho em turnos, saúde e vida social dos trabalhadores. In view of {{the lack}} of {{information}} on shift-work schedules and working organization in companies located in Botucatu, São Paulo State, we obtained initial information on areas of economic activity, number of workers, and work schedules from companis by using facsimiles and <b>mailgrams</b> afler receiving a list of companies from the directory of the CIESP. To those who confirmed the use of work in shifts, a questionnaire with instructions was sent in order to characterize how work was organized. There were 42 manufacturing industries among 66 companies responding to the study. Fourteen companies reported occurrence of work in shifts, including 6, 541 workers out of 9, 502 in the 66 companies. There were 2, 346 workers with shift schedules on production divisions in the companies reporting the existence of shift systems. Eight companies had been using rotating shift systems, of which 5 reported rotation schemes with 6 or more consecutive night shifts. Two companies notified shift schedules with counter-clockwise direction of rotation including 684 workers in production divisions. There were systems with single and multiple shifts lasting from 5 to 8 hours and many work schedules even with the same length and same number of shifts. This information will allow us to evaluate the relationship between shift work, health, and the social life of shift workers...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>Mailgram</b> {{is a type}} of telegraphic message {{which is}} {{transmitted}} electronically from the sender to a post office and then printed and delivered to the recipient via postal means.|$|E
5000|$|The {{advantage}} of Mailgrams over postal mail was speed and verifiability of transmission; they were {{widely used in}} official notifications and legal transactions. Their advantage over full-rate telegrams was lower cost while still maintaining {{the look and feel}} of an important Western Union Telegram. The <b>Mailgram</b> quickly became a widely used medium for business-to-consumer communications.|$|E
50|$|Western Union {{became the}} first American {{telecommunications}} corporation to maintain its own fleet of geosynchronous communications satellites, starting in 1974. The fleet of satellites, called Westar, carried communications within the Western Union company for telegram and <b>mailgram</b> message data to Western Union bureaus nationwide. It also handled traffic for its Telex and TWX (Telex II) services. The Westar satellites' transponders were also leased by other companies for relaying video, voice, data, and facsimile (fax) transmissions.|$|E
50|$|A related {{innovation}} {{that came from}} AUTODIN was Western Union's computer based EasyLink service. This system allowed {{for one of the}} first marketable email systems for non-government users. In addition, the system allowed the same message to be sent simultaneously to multiple recipients via email, fax, <b>mailgram,</b> or telex services as well as allowing messages to be sent from the integrated formats. With the service, users could also perform research utilizing its InfoLink application. EasyLink Services International Corporation is now a separate company.|$|E

In this way, a single message could be sent to multiple distant Telex and TWX machines as well as delivering the same message to non-Telex and non-TWX subscribers via Western Union <b>Mailgram.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Telex {{served as}} the forerunner of modern fax, email, and texting - both {{technically}} and stylistically.

40|$|Interfaces, 21, pp. 26 - 38 (1989 Koopman Award winner). The {{ability to}} rapidly {{mobilize}} the Marine Corps {{in times of}} crisis is a cornerstone of United States defense strategy. To mobilize rapidly, the marines need an efficient system for assigning officers to mobilization billets. The system we designed and built is based on a network optimization algorithm that works in conjunction with carefully designed and scrupulously maintained Marine Corps data bases. It takes less than 10 minutes based on a 386 -based personal computer to complete a mobilization involving 40, 000 officers and 27, 000 billets and to produce output suitable for generating orders to report via <b>MAILGRAM.</b> Prior to our work, the Marine Corps had a mainframe-based system that took two to four days to complete a mobilization.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The ability to rapidly mobilize the Marine Corps {{in times of}} crisis is a cornerstone of United States defense strategy. We present a network- optimization based system which, in conjunction with carefully designed and scrupulously maintained manpower databases, assigns Marine officers to mobilization billets. The system is installed on a 386 -based personal computer, and takes less than 10 minutes to complete a mobilization involving as many as 40, 000 officers (i. e. all available active-duty, reserve and retired Marine officers) and 27, 000 billets. The small amount of PC computing time that the system spends on this very large assignment problem includes the production of output suitable for generating orders-to-report via <b>MAILGRAM.</b> Prior to our work, the only tool the Marine Corps had to help with mobilization assignment was a mainframe-based system which takes two to four days to complete a mobilization. The new system is not only much faster, but it also produces significantly better assignments than the old system with respect to all measures of effectiveness considered.
