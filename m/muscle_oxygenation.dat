RESULTS: <b>Muscle</b> microvascular <b>oxygenation</b> was reduced in SS patients compared to the SC and AA groups and this reduction {{was not related to}} hemorhelogical abnormalities. No difference was observed between the three groups for oxygen consumption and vasomotion activity.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationships}} among <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> level measured by a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), blood lactate concentraion (La) and substrate utilization durling a prolonged 60 -min steady-state exercise below the anaerobic threshold (AT). Ten healthy adult subjects (3 males and 7 females) completed an orientation trial, a miximal exercise test, and a submaximal exercise for 60 min. The oxygenated hemoglobin and myoglobin saturation (<b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> level) measured by NIRS was recorded cintinuously throughout the tests. The probe was located on the vastus lateralis muscle, At 30 min after exercise, the calbration of NIRS was performed by the cuff occlusion at 260 mmHg for 10 min. The relative change in <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> level was estimated by regarding <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> level in the resting condition as 0 % and that obtained during thigh occlusion as - 100 %. Oxygen consumption (VO 2), carbon dioxide production (VCO 2), minute ventilation (VE), respiratory exchange raito (RER), heart rate (HR) and La were measured at rest and during exercise. <b>Muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> level decreased immediately after the onset of exercise and gradually increased from - 24. 2 ± 10. 8 % at 5 min to - 3. 3 ± 11. 8 % at 60 min.

40|$|Sympathetically evoked {{vasoconstriction}} is modulated by {{skeletal muscle}} contraction, but the underlying events are incompletely understood. During contraction, intramuscular oxygenation decreases with increasing exercise intensity. We therefore hypothesized that tissue hypoxia plays {{a crucial role}} in the attenuation of sympathetic vasoconstriction in contracting skeletal muscle. In 19 subjects, near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure decreases in <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> (ΔtHbO 2 +MbO 2) as an estimate of the vasoconstrictor response to reflex sympathetic activation with lower body negative pressure (LBNP) in the microcirculation of resting and contracting forearm muscles. Oxygen delivery to the muscles was reduced by decreasing (a) arterial O 2 content by breathing 10 % O 2, or (b) muscle perfusion by applying forearm positive pressure (FPP, + 40 mmHg). In resting forearm, reflex sympathetic activation decreased <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> by 11 ± 1 %. Handgrip alone at 5 and 20 % of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) decreased <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> by 4 ± 1 and 28 ± 4 %, respectively. When superimposed on handgrip, LBNP-induced decreases in <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> were preserved during handgrip at 5 % MVC, but were abolished during handgrip at 20 % MVC. Oral administration of aspirin (1 g) did not restore the latter response. When the decrease in forearm <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> elicited by handgrip at 20 % MVC was mimicked by either (a) systemic hypoxia plus 5 % handgrip (ΔtHbO 2 +MbO 2, − 32 ± 3 %), or (b) hypoperfusion of resting muscle by FPP (ΔtHbO 2 +MbO 2, − 26 ± 6 %), LBNP-induced decreases in <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> were greatly attenuated. These data suggest that local tissue hypoxia is involved in the metabolic attenuation of sympathetic vasoconstriction in the microcirculation of exercising human skeletal muscle.

Six healthy subjects repeated 30 bouts of intermittent cycle exercise with a work: recovery ratio of 15 s: 10 s. The exercise workloads were 90 % and 100 % of maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max). Changes in oxygenation in the vastus later-alis muscle were monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). <b>Muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> levels showed the pattern of that the decrease during every work period and the increase during recovery. From the onset of exercise at each workload, <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> levels declined and then reached the minimum during the 2 nd work period. However there was no difference between the two intensities. After the 25 th pedalling a dynamic steady state for <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> level was observed.

In 12 subjects (18 – 35 years old), oscillatory neck pressure (NP, + 40 mmHg) was applied at 0. 1 Hz (i. e. 5 s on, 5 s off) for 5 min to determine the degree of CBR control over heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure (ABP), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), femoral blood velocity and skeletal <b>muscle</b> tissue <b>oxygenation</b> at rest and during 7 W dynamic knee-extension exercise. Skeletal <b>muscle</b> tissue <b>oxygenation</b> measurements of both the exercising and nonexercising leg were evaluated. Fast Fourier transformation was performed on 5 min segments to calculate spectral power of the R–R interval (RRI), ABP, MSNA, femoral blood velocity and tissue oxygenation time series, and the low-frequency (LF, 0. 085 – 0. 115 Hz) power spectra were compared to evaluate the degree of CBR-mediated entrainment for each variable. At rest, sinusoidal NP significantly increased LF spectral power of RRI, ABP, MSNA and femoral blood velocity. During exercise, sinusoidal NP provoked a similar increase in spectral power for RRI and MSNA, while CBR-mediated changes in ABP and femoral blood velocity were attenuated compared to rest. Changes in spectral power of skeletal <b>muscle</b> tissue <b>oxygenation</b> during sinusoidal NP were similar between the exercising and nonexercising leg at rest. However, during exercise the changes in skeletal <b>muscle</b> tissue <b>oxygenation</b> power were significantly less in the exercising leg, while changes in the nonexercising leg were similar to rest. We have demonstrated simultaneous entrainment of all CBR end-organ measurements, ranging from cardiac chronotropic effects to alterations {{at the level of}} the skeletal muscle microcirculation. Moreover, we have identified a significant and specific attenuation of end-organ responsiveness to CBR-mediated sympathoexcitation in the vasculature of the exercising muscle.

40|$|Metabolic {{products}} of skeletal muscle contraction activate metaboreceptor muscle afferents that reflexively increase sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) targeted to both resting and exercising skeletal muscle.

The major new finding is that the ability of reflex-sympathetic activation to decrease <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> is abolished when the muscle is exercised at an intensity > 10 % of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). During high intensity handgrip, (45 % MVC), contraction-induced decreases in <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> remained stable despite progressive metaboreceptor-mediated reflex increases in SNA.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Anatomy and PhysiologyDavid C. PooleThe overall {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to better}} understand the mechanisms determining skeletal muscle oxygen delivery-utilization matching in health and disease. Emphasis is directed toward the role of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability in modulating <b>muscle</b> microvascular <b>oxygenation</b> (PO 2 mv; the sole driving force for blood-myocyte oxygen flux) during transitions in metabolic demand. The first investigation of this dissertation (Chapter 2) demonstrates that alterations in NO bioavailability {{have a major impact on}} skeletal muscle PO 2 mv kinetics following both the onset and cessation of contractions. Specifically, increased NO levels (via the NO donor sodium nitroprusside; SNP) elevates whereas reduced NO levels (non-specific NOS inhibition with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester; L-NAME) diminishes muscle PO 2 mv at the onset and during recovery from contractions in the spinotrapezius muscle of healthy young rats. Consistent with these results, inhibition of the neuronal NO synthase isoform (S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline; SMTC; Chapter 3) reveals alterations in NO-mediated regulation of skeletal muscle PO 2 mv with advanced age that likely contribute to exercise intolerance in this population. In Chapter 4 we observed that pronounced oxidative stress is implicated in these pathological responses seen in aged and diseased states. Transient elevations in the oxidant hydrogen peroxide to levels seen in the early stages of senescence and cardiovascular diseases promote detrimental effects on skeletal muscle contractile function (i. e., augmented oxygen cost of force production). Chapter 5 demonstrates that endurance exercise training improves skeletal <b>muscle</b> microvascular <b>oxygenation</b> (i. e., greater PO 2 mv and slower PO 2 mv kinetics) across the metabolic transient partly via enhanced NO-mediated function in healthy young individuals. These data carry important clinical implications given that exercise training may ameliorate NO-mediated function, <b>muscle</b> microvascular <b>oxygenation</b> deficits and consequently exercise intolerance in aged and diseased populations. In conclusion, alterations in NO bioavailability have a major impact on the dynamic balance between skeletal muscle oxygen delivery and utilization (i. e., PO 2 mv kinetics) in health and disease. While advanced age or the predations of disease impair considerably skeletal <b>muscle</b> microvascular <b>oxygenation,</b> exercise training-induced adaptations on the oxygen transport system constitute a non-pharmacological therapeutic intervention potentially capable of mitigating these microcirculatory deficits...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the reproducibility of grip force and <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> kinetics with a decrease of the gripping force during maximal repeated rhythmic grip (RRG). Subjects were 10 males, aged 20 - 26 years (height 173. 9 ± 17. 3 cm, body weight 71. 5 ± 11. 2 kg). Each subject performed maximal repeated rhythmic grip as a target value with a target frequency of 30 grips mm for 6 mm. The trialto-trial reproducibility of Oxygenated haemoglobin (Oxy-Hb), Deoxy~enated haemoglobin (Deoxy-Hb), Total haemoglobin (Total Hb) and grip force during the RRG (6 min) was very high (rxy= 0. 919 - 0. 966) and the decreasing pattern of the force-time curve was consistent. The cross correlation coefficients of the grip force (rxy= 0. 985) and <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> kinetics (Total Hb: 0. 996, Oxy-Hb: 0. 992, DeoxyHb: 0. 995) in the pre-inflection phase (marked force decreasing phase) were very high, while these coefficients in the post-inflection phase (almost steady state phase) were low as compared with those in the pre-inflection phase. The trialto-trial reliabilities of any parameter regarding grip were fair or high (lCC= 0. 686 - 0. 927). The changing points of <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> kinetics appeared before reaching an almost steady state, which showed a high reliability and they were considered to reflect the shift of physiological mechanisms.

It has also been reported that hypoxia augments activity on electromyography (EMG) during exercise (Amann et al. 2006, 2007; Taylor et al. 1997; Katayama et al. 2006, 2010). Katayama et al. (2010) conducted a study using two types of isometric quadriceps exercise, which were either sustained or intermittent exercise, under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Consequently, both muscle deoxygenation and EMG responses were exaggerated during intermittent isometric exercise under hypoxic compared with normoxic conditions, whereas {{there were no differences}} between conditions for either <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> or EMG during sustained exercise. Therefore, it is thought that hypoxia-induced muscle deoxygenation may affect the rate of accumulation of muscle metabolites, such as lactate and inorganic phosphate (Pi) (Hogan et al. 1999; Richardson et al. 1998), which leads to increased motor unit recruitment (Amann and Calbet 2008). On the other hand, Woorons et al. (2010) reported that exercise under VH conditions elicits lower <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> compared to that during exercise with normal breathing (NB). We also observed decreased <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> levels during exercise under VH conditions in our preliminary experiments.

METHODS: Twelve trained male cyclists [age: 31 ± 7 year (mean ± SD) ] performed 15 km time-trial cycling (TT) and steady-state submaximal cycling (50, 100, and 150 W) in normoxia and hypoxia (11 % inspired O 2) following 3 -day oral supplementation with either placebo or sodium nitrate (0. 1 mmol/kg/day). We measured TT time-to-completion, <b>muscle</b> tissue <b>oxygenation</b> during TT and systolic right ventricle to right atrium pressure gradient (RV-RA gradient: index of PAP) during steady state cycling. RESULTS: During steady state exercise, hypoxia elevated RV-RA gradient (p > 0. 05), while oral nitrate supplementation did not alter RV-RA gradient (p > 0. 05). During 15 km TT, hypoxia lowered <b>muscle</b> tissue <b>oxygenation</b> (p 0. 05).

For the left leg, no difference was found between skating modes in <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation.</b> Respectively, two (ST= 5. 8 ± 2. 0; LT= 4. 2 ± 1. 5) and four hours (ST= 4. 6 ± 1. 9; LT= 3. 1 ± 1. 6) after the time-trials, {{a higher rate of}} perceived exertion was found for ST. Based on our results, ST seems more physiologically demanding, and longer periods of recovery are needed after training compared to LT. Technical aspects unique to the exercise mode seem to impact on oxygenation, affecting processes related to the regulation of exercise intensity such as fatigue and recovery...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine whether ischemia, which reduces oxygenation in the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscle, causes a reduction in muscle force production. In eight subjects, <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> (TO 2) of the right ECR was measured noninvasively and continuously using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) while muscle twitch force was elicited by transcutaneous electrical stimulation (1 Hz, 0. 1 ms). Baseline measurements of blood volume, <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> and twitch force were recorded continuously, then a tourniquet on the upper arm was inflated to one of five different pressure levels: 20, 40, 60 mm Hg (randomized order) and diastolic (69 +/- 9. 8 mm Hg) and systolic (106 +/- 12. 8 mm Hg) blood pressures. Each pressure level was maintained for 3 - 5 min, and was followed by a recovery period sufficient to allow measurements to return to baseline. For each respective tourniquet pressure level, mean TO 2 decreased from resting baseline (100 % TO 2) to 99 +/- 1. 2 % (SEM), 96 +/- 1. 9 %, 93 +/- 2. 8 %, 90 +/- 2. 5 %, and 86 +/- 2. 7 %, and mean twitch force decreased from resting baseline (100 % force) to 99 +/- 0. 7 % (SEM), 96 +/- 2. 7 %, 93 +/- 3. 1 %, 88 +/- 3. 2 %, and 86 +/- 2. 6 %. <b>Muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> and twitch force at 60 mm Hg tourniquet compression and above were significantly lower (P < 0. 05) than baseline value. Reduced twitch force was correlated in a dose-dependent manner with reduced <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> (r = 0. 78, P < 0. 001). Although the correlation does not prove causation, the results indicate that ischemia leading to a 7 % or greater reduction in <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> causes decreased muscle force production in the forearm extensor muscle. Thus, ischemia associated with a modest decline in TO 2 causes muscle fatigue...|$|E

40|$|We {{assessed}} respiratory <b>muscles</b> <b>oxygenation</b> responses {{during a}} ramp exercise to exhaustion and further explored {{their relationship with}} the non-linear increase of VO 2 (VO 2 excess) observed above the gas-exchange threshold. Ten male cyclists completed a ramp exercise to exhaustion on an electromagnetically braked cycle-ergometer with a rate of increment of 30 Wmin(- 1) with continuous monitoring of expired gases (breath-by-breath) and oxygenation status of intercostal muscles. Maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure measurements were taken at rest and at exhaustion. The VO 2 excess represents the difference between VO 2 max observed and VO 2 max expected using linear equation between the VO 2 and the intensity before gas-exchange threshold. The deoxyhemoglobin remained unchanged until 60 % of maximal aerobic power (MAP) and thereafter increased significantly by 37 ± 18 % and 40 ± 22 % at 80 % and 100 % of MAP, respectively. Additionally, the amplitude of deoxyhemoglobin increase between 60 and 100 % of MAP positively correlated with the VO 2 excess (r= 0. 69, p< 0. 05). Compared to exercise start, the oxygen tissue saturation index decreased from 80 % of MAP (- 4. 8 ± 3. 2 %, p< 0. 05) onwards. At exhaustion, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures declined by 7. 8 ± 16 % and 12. 6 ± 10 % (both p< 0. 05), respectively. In summary, our results suggest a significant contribution of respiratory muscles to the VO 2 excess phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of duration of low-load repetitive work on intramuscular lactate, pyruvate, glutamate and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), and oxygen saturation in the trapezius muscle. Twenty healthy females were studied during baseline rest, during low-load repetitive work for either 30 (REP 30) or 60 min (REP 60) and 60 min recovery. Intramuscular microdialysate (IMMD) samples were obtained, and local <b>muscle</b> tissue <b>oxygenation</b> (%StO(2)) assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Subjects rated their perceived exertion (Borg CR- 10 scale) and capillary blood was sampled for lactate analysis. The results showed a significant increase in IMMD lactate in response to both REP 30 and REP 60 (P < 0. 05 and P < 0. 01, respectively) and glutamate (P < 0. 0001), but no progressive increase with increasing work duration. Both IMMD pyruvate and lactate tended to be significantly increased during the recovery period. No corresponding increase in blood lactate was found. Local muscle %StO(2) did not change significantly in response to work and was not correlated to the IMMD lactate concentration. The ratings of perceived exertion increased in response to work, and remained increased after recovery for REP 60. In conclusion, the results of this study show significantly increased IMMD lactate and, glutamate concentrations in the trapezius muscle of healthy females in response to low-load work, but no progressive increase with increased work duration. Further, they do not indicate that the increased IMMD lactate concentration was caused by a locally decreased or insufficient <b>muscle</b> tissue <b>oxygenation...</b>|$|R
30|$|Maintenance {{of power}} output during high-intensity {{intermittent}} exercise {{is thought to}} be limited by depletion of phosphocreatine (PCr) stores (Gaitanos et al. 1993). An accelerated drop in accessory respiratory <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> was related to an attenuated fall in leg <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> in heavy exercise (Legrand et al. 2007). Thus, the high oxygen requirement of respiratory muscle may lead to limited oxygen use by locomotor muscles (Legrand et al. 2007). Additionally, respiratory muscle fatigue appears to result from increased respiratory muscle work combined with competition with the locomotor muscles of the limbs for blood flow (Romer and Polkey 2008). Previous studies (Lin et al. 2007; Tong and Fu 2006; Volianitis et al. 2001) have suggested that improved performance following IM warm-up is partly attributable to enhanced IM function. Improved IM function might delay IM fatigue, thus influencing the supply and delivery of oxygen to working locomotor muscles. Indeed, high-intensity intermittent cycling exercise performance was related to changes in locomotor <b>muscle</b> <b>oxygenation</b> (Ohya et al. 2013). As PCr resynthesis depends on oxygen availability (Harris et al. 1976; Haseler et al. 1999), inhibition of IM fatigue might contribute to maintenance of performance during high-intensity intermittent sprint exercise.|$|E

40|$|Background: The use of {{wavelengths}} of the near-infrared region by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) {{has been studied}} for several applications in vascular disease. This systematic review aims to explore the clinical relevance of monitoring <b>muscle</b> tissue <b>oxygenation</b> in vascular disease with NIRS. Methods: A systematic search in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane databases was performed to identify clinical NIRS studies, published until April 2015, involving <b>muscle</b> tissue <b>oxygenation</b> in vascular disease. Results: After screening 183 manuscripts, 38 studies (n = 2010) were included. Studies concerned peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (twelve studies, n = 848), compartment syndrome of lower extremities (seven studies, n = 205), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (six studies, n = 429), buttock and lower extremity ischaemia in abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (six studies, n = 139), free flap failure (five studies, n = 354), and spinal cord ischaemia in thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair (two studies, n = 35). Nine studies compared NIRS with gold standards and provided cut-off values. Four studies regarding chronic compartment syndrome and DVT determined higher sensitivity (78 %- 97 %) than specificity (56 %- 76 %). Two studies regarding PAD and buttock claudication determined higher specificity (87 %- 95 %) than sensitivity (33 %- 88 %). Three studies regarding free flap failure determined sensitivity and specificity of 100 %. Conclusion: We found sufficient evidence to use NIRS in clinical setting for assessment of chronic compartment syndrome of lower extremities, and as surveillance tool for detection of free flap failure. So far, clinical relevance of routine use of NIRS in other vascular applications is less clear. Cut-off values to discriminate are not yet unanimous and better validation has to be awaited for...|$|R
