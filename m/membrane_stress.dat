Little is known about how these vesicles aid virulence but it has been speculated that they may contribute by secreting toxins and help in the evasion of the immune system. Recent studies showed that VrrA expression is activated by the alternative stress sigma factor, sigma E; unlike other strains of bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella, it does not require the Hfq protein to regulate the sigma factor. It was also shown that VrrA transcription increases on exposure to UV light and that over expression of VrrA resulted in an increase in outer membrane vesicles secreted.

40|$|Design of {{components}} against incremental deformation or “ratcheting ” under cyclic loading conditions is addressed in Article NB- 3200 of Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The ratcheting rules, {{based on the}} Bree diagram, relate primary stress and secondary stress ranges that are calculated elastically and aim to approximate elastic-plastic material behaviors under cyclic loading. The Bree diagram was developed for cases with through-thickness thermal bending and constant primary <b>membrane</b> <b>stress.</b> It {{does not account for}} high thermal <b>membrane</b> <b>stress</b> that can occur near gross structural or thermal discontinuities. Cyclic thermal <b>membrane</b> <b>stress</b> combined with sustained stress can lead to ratcheting that is not accounted for in the current design rules. This paper discusses the validation of proposed criteria for evaluating thermal stress ratcheting under high thermal <b>membrane</b> <b>stress</b> using an elastic analysis. These proposed criteria are confirmed by an analysis of a nozzle that is attached by a partial penetration weld to a vessel head and subjected to severe thermal cycling. Linearized stresses from an elastic analysis under pressure and thermal loadings typical for a nuclear power plant are compared to limits in NB- 3200 for thermal stress ratcheting. Additionally, an elastic-perfectly plastic analysis is used to evaluate if the component will shakedown. This analysis demonstrates that the proposed rules prevent ratcheting of a typical geometry with typical operating loads in a nuclear plant. The current thermal stress ratcheting rules evaluated on an elastic basis are enhanced to cover cases with high thermal <b>membrane</b> <b>stress</b> while not removing conservatism.

Nanopod production is driven by OMV formation, and in Delftia acidovorans Cs 1 - 4 growth on phenanthrene induces OMV/nanopod formation. While OMV production {{has been associated with}} many functions, particularly with pathogens, linkage to biodegradation has been limited to a <b>membrane</b> <b>stress</b> response to lipophilic compounds. The objectives of this study were to determine: 1.) Whether induction of nanopod formation was linked to phenanthrene metabolism or a non-specific <b>membrane</b> <b>stress</b> response, and 2.) The relative importance of OMV/nanopod formation vs. formation of the S-layer alone to phenanthrene utilization. <b>Membrane</b> <b>stress</b> response was investigated by quantifying nanopod formation following exposure to compounds that exceeded phenanthrene in membrane stress-inducing potential. Naphthalene did not induce nanopod formation, and toluene was a weak inducer compared to phenanthrene (two- vs. six-fold increase, respectively).

Impacts on phenanthrene biodegradation of OMV/nanopod production vs. S-layer formation were assessed with D. acidovorans Cs 1 - 4 mutants deficient in S-layer formation or OMV/nanopod production.

Blocking of trafficking disrupts normal membrane dynamics and causes <b>membrane</b> <b>stress.</b> Two similar proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Myr 1 and Smy 2, each containing a polyproline-binding GYF domain, were discovered in separate screens for dosage suppressors of trafficking mutations. The functions of GYF domain proteins are poorly described despite its determined structure and a number of known polyproline peptide ligands. We predicted, using computational analysis, associations between mRNA decay factors and both Myr 1 and Smy 2, and further demonstrated that they localize to sites of mRNA degradation upon stress, in a GYF domain dependent manner. Ypt 6 is a small GTPase that regulates vesicle docking at the late Golgi in budding yeast. Myr 1 was found as a novel suppressor during the screening of a genomic library in a null ypt 6 mutant. Myr 1 additionally was capable of rescuing the temperature sensitive growth of a Ric 1 deficient strain. Importantly, Ric 1 is an activator of Ypt 6 and is synthetic lethal with Myr 1. Biochemical characterization of the Myr 1 protein revealed a limited solubility and an ability to bind cellular membranes, likely relevant to the rescue of trafficking mutants. We further assayed the affinity of Myr 1 domains to liposomes of distinct composition. Preference for negatively charged lipids suggested possible electrostatic interactions with polybasic clusters within C-terminal regions of Myr 1. In contrast, the N-terminus with the GYF domain was found to be capable of self-association. <b>Membrane</b> <b>stress</b> caused by a lipid-bilayer perturbing drug resulted in induced formation of mRNA processing bodies.

40|$|<b>Membrane</b> <b>stresses</b> act along thin bodies {{which are}} {{relatively}} well lubricated on both surfaces. They operate in ice sheets because {{the bottom is}} either sliding, or is much less viscous than the top owing to stress and heat softening of the basal ice. Ice streams flow over very well lubricated beds, and are restrained at their sides. The ideal of the perfectly slippery bed is considered in this paper, and the propagation of mechanical effects along an ice stream considered by applying spatially varying horizontal body forces. Propagation distances depend sensitively on the rheological index, and can be very large for ice-type rheologies. A new analytical solution for ice-shelf profiles and grounded tractionless stream profiles is presented, which show blow up of the profile in a finite distance upstream at locations where the flux is non-zero. This is a feature of an earlier analytical solution for a floating shelf. The length scale of decay of <b>membrane</b> <b>stresses</b> from the grounding line is investigated through scale analysis. In ice sheets, such effects decay over distances of several tens of kilometres, creating a vertical boundary layer between sheet flow and shelf flow, where <b>membrane</b> <b>stresses</b> adjust. Bounded, physically reasonable steady surface profiles only exist conditionally in this boundary layer. Where bounded steady profiles exist, adjacent profile equilibria for the whole ice sheet corresponding to different grounded areas occur (neutral equilibrium). If no solution in the boundary layer can exist, the ice-sheet profile must change. The conditions for existence can be written {{in terms of whether}} the basal rate factor (sliding or internal deformation) is too large to permit a steady solution. The critical value depends extremely sensitively on ice velocity and the back stress applied at the grounding line. High ice velocity and high stress both favour the existence of solutions and stability. Changes in these parameters can cause the steady solution existence criterion to be traversed, and the ice-sheet dynamics to change. A finite difference model which represents both neutral equilibrium and the dynamical transition is presented, and preliminary investigations into its numerical sensitivity are carried out. Evidence for the existence of a long wavelength instability is presented through the solution of a numerical eigenproblem, which will hamper predictability. ...|$|R
