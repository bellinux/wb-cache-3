25|$|As Honda {{entered into}} {{automobile}} manufacturing {{in the late}} 1960s, where Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan had been making cars since before WWII, it appears that Honda instilled a sense of doing things a little differently than its Japanese competitors. Its mainstay products, like the Accord and Civic (with the exception of its USA-market 1993–97 Passport {{which was part of}} a vehicle exchange program with Isuzu (part of the Subaru-Isuzu joint venture)), have always employed front-wheel-drive powertrain implementation, which is currently a long held Honda tradition. Honda also installed new technologies into their products, first as optional equipment, then later standard, like anti lock brakes, speed sensitive power steering, and <b>multi-port</b> fuel injection in the early 1980s. This desire {{to be the first to}} try new approaches is evident with the creation of the first Japanese luxury chain Acura, and was also evident with the all aluminum, mid-engined sports car, the Honda NSX, which also introduced variable valve timing technology, Honda calls VTEC.|$|E

40|$|<b>Multi-ported</b> RAMs are {{essential}} for high-performance parallel computation systems. VLIW and vector processors, CGRAs, DSPs, CMPs and other processing systems often rely upon <b>multi-ported</b> memories for parallel access, hence higher performance. Although memories {{with a large number}} of read and write ports are important, their high implementation cost means they are used sparingly in designs. As a result, FPGA vendors only provide dual-ported block RAMs to handle the majority of usage patterns. In this paper, a novel and modular approach is proposed to construct <b>multi-ported</b> memories out of basic dual-ported RAM blocks. Like other <b>multi-ported</b> RAM designs, each write port uses a different RAM bank and each read port uses bank replication. The main contribution of this work is an optimization that merges the previous live-value-table (LVT) and XOR approaches into a common design that uses a generalized...|$|R
