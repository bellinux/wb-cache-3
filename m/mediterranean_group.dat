40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of an intervention aimed to increase adherence to a Mediterranean diet. DESIGN: A 12 -month assessment of a randomized primary prevention trial. SUBJECTS/SETTINGS: One thousand five hundred fifty-one asymptomatic persons aged 55 to 80 years, with diabetes or &gt; or = 3 cardiovascular risk factors. INTERVENTION: Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} a control <b>group</b> or two <b>Mediterranean</b> diet <b>groups.</b> Those allocated to the two <b>Mediterranean</b> diet <b>groups</b> received individual motivational interviews every 3 months to negotiate nutrition goals, and group educational sessions on a quarterly basis. One <b>Mediterranean</b> diet <b>group</b> received free virgin olive oil (1 L/week), the other received free mixed nuts (30 g/day). Participants in the control group received verbal instructions and a leaflet recommending the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III dietary guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in food and nutrient intake after 12 months. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Paired t tests (for within-group changes) and analysis of variance (for between-group changes) were conducted. RESULTS: Participants allocated to both Mediterranean diets increased their intake of virgin olive oil, nuts, vegetables, legumes, and fruits (P&lt; 0. 05 for all within- and between-group differences). Participants in all three groups decreased their intake of meat and pastries, cakes, and sweets (P&lt; 0. 05 for all).

50|$|In 862 {{two groups}} of Vikings—one the larger of two fleets {{recently}} {{forced out of the}} Seine by Charles the Bald, the other a fleet returning from a Mediterranean expedition—converged on Brittany, where one (the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>group)</b> was hired by the Breton duke Salomon to ravage the Loire valley. Robert the Strong, Margrave of Neustria, captured twelve of their ships, killing all on board save a few who fled. He then opened negotiations with the former Seine Vikings, and hired them against Salomon for 6,000 pounds of silver. The purpose of this was doubtless to prevent them from entering the service of Salomon. Probably Robert had to collect a large amount in taxes to finance what was effectively a non-tributary Danegeld designed to keep the Vikings out of Neustria. The treaty between the Franks and the Vikings did not last more than a year: in 863 Salomon made peace and the Vikings, deprived of an enemy, ravaged Neustria.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background We have {{previously}} reported that rheumatoid arthritis patients, who adopted a modified Cretan Mediterranean diet, obtained {{a reduction in}} disease activity and an improvement in physical function and vitality. This shift in diet is {{likely to result in}} an altered intake of fatty acids. Therefore, the objective {{of the present study was}} to examine the dietary intake of fatty acids, as well as the fatty acid profile in serum phospholipids, during the dietary intervention study presented earlier. Results From baseline to the end of the study, changes in the reported consumption of various food groups were observed in the <b>Mediterranean</b> diet <b>group.</b> The change in diet resulted in a number of differences between the <b>Mediterranean</b> diet <b>group</b> and the control diet group regarding the fatty acid intake. For instance, a lower ratio of n- 6 to n- 3 fatty acids was observed in the <b>Mediterranean</b> diet <b>group,</b> both assessed by diet history interviews (dietary intake) and measured in serum phospholipids. Moreover, the patients in the <b>Mediterranean</b> diet <b>group</b> that showed a moderate or better clinical improvement during the study (diet responders), had a higher reported intake of n- 3 fatty acids and a lower ratio of n- 6 to n- 3 fatty acids compared to the patients with minor or no improvement. Also the fatty acid profile in serum phospholipids differed in part between the diet responders and the diet non-responders. Conclusion The changes in the fatty acid profile, indicated both by dietary assessments and through fatty acids in s-phospholipids may, at least in part, explain the beneficial effects of the Cretan Mediterranean diet that we have presented earlier. </p...|$|R

Other species living along the island's coast include mantas and smaller cetaceans such as dolphins and Risso's dolphins.
