5|$|Tchaikovsky's {{analysis}} {{of each of}} The Five was unsparing. While {{at least some of}} his observations may seem distorted and prejudiced, he also mentions some details which ring clear and true. His diagnosis of Rimsky-Korsakov's creative crisis is very accurate. He also calls Mussorgsky the most gifted musically of the Five, though Tchaikovsky could not appreciate the forms Mussorgsky's originality took. Nonetheless, he badly underestimates Borodin's technique and gives Balakirev far less than his full due—all the <b>more</b> <b>telling</b> in light of Balakirev's help in conceiving and shaping Romeo and Juliet.|$|E

500|$|On 11 November, he {{returned}} to Maer and proposed to Emma, once <b>more</b> <b>telling</b> her his ideas. She accepted, then in exchanges of loving letters she showed how she valued his openness in sharing their differences, also expressing her strong Unitarian beliefs and concerns that his honest doubts might separate them in the afterlife. While he was house-hunting in London, bouts of illness continued and Emma wrote urging him to get some rest, almost prophetically remarking [...] "So don't be ill any more my dear Charley till I can be with you to nurse you." [...] He found what they called [...] "Macaw Cottage" [...] (because of its gaudy interiors) in Gower Street, then moved his [...] "museum" [...] in over Christmas.

500|$|Elsewhere in the museum, {{they stole}} five Degas {{drawings}} and an eagle finial. The finial {{lay at the}} top of a Napoleonic flag, which they attempted to unscrew from the wall, but failed. Manet's Chez Tortoni was also stolen from its location in the Blue Room. Motion detector records show that the only footsteps detected in the Blue Room that night were at 12:27a.m. and again at 12:53a.m. These times match to when Abath said he passed through on patrol. The frame for the painting was found on security chief Lyle W. Grindle's chair near the front desk. The thieves made two trips to their car with artwork during the theft, which lasted 81 minutes. Before leaving, they visited the guards once <b>more,</b> <b>telling</b> them [...] "You’ll be hearing from us in about a year," [...] although they were never heard from again.

500|$|Francis, affectionately called [...] "Franky" [...] by his parents, was {{described}} as a [...] "precocious, curious and special" [...] child by Franklin, [...] "a golden child, his smiles brighter, his babblings <b>more</b> <b>telling</b> and his tricks more magical than all the other infants in the colonies combined" [...] by historian of medicine Howard Markel and as [...] "a most engaging child, of singular beauty and wonderful knowingness" [...] by biographer James Parton. [...] Given that Franklin considered Francis to be a [...] "healthy child who thrived from the start," [...] and [...] "very clever," [...] he advertised for a tutor for his two sons in December 1734. By all accounts, Francis was doted on by his parents; his portrait was painted while he was still a baby. [...] By 1734, Franklin's business as a writer, publisher and founder of the Library Company of Philadelphia was going well enough {{that he was able to}} build a house for his family of four, at 318 Market Street.|$|E

[...] In the Third Olynthiac {{and in the}} Third Philippic, Demosthenes characterised Philip as a [...] "barbarian", one of {{the various}} abusive terms applied by the orator to the king of Macedon.* D. M. MacDowell, Demosthenes the Orator, ch. 13; I. Worthington, Alexander the Great, 21. According to Konstantinos Tsatsos and Douglas M. MacDowell, Demosthenes {{regarded}} as Greeks only those who had reached the cultural standards of south Greece {{and he did not}} take into consideration ethnological criteria.* K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 258. His contempt for Philip is forcefully expressed in the Third Philippic 31 in these terms: [...] "...he is not only no Greek, nor related to the Greeks, but not even a barbarian from any place that can be named with honour, but a pestilent knave from Macedonia, whence it was never yet possible to buy a decent slave."

500|$|Brown's trial {{came before}} the Supreme Court in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The {{presiding}} judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week. The weakness of the case was {{directly related to the}} provisions of the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the oath, but the Act allowed unsworn testimony to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could weigh the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even <b>more</b> <b>telling</b> was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an [...] "uncivilised person or persons" [...] was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence. A week later, the judge remained unconvinced about the strength of the prosecution, but given [...] "great suspicion rested on the case", he gave the prosecution a further extension of time, and released Brown on bail of ₤500.|$|E
500|$|<b>More</b> <b>telling</b> was a communique sent on 7 November 1944 by the OSS, Secret Intelligence Branch in Bari, Italy which {{apparently}} acknowledged that Wallenberg was acting as an unofficial liaison between the OSS and the Hungarian Independence Movement (MFM), an underground anti-Nazi resistance organization. The OSS message notes Wallenberg's contacts with Geza Soos, a high-ranking MFM leader and further explains that Soos [...] "may only be contacted" [...] through the Swedish legation in Budapest, which was Wallenberg's workplace and {{also served as}} the operational center for his attempts to aid the Hungarian Jews. The same message's assertion that Wallenberg [...] "will know if he (Soos) is not in Budapest" [...] is also curious, in that by November 1944 Soos was in hiding and knowledge of his whereabouts would only have been available to individuals closely involved with the MFM. This conclusion is given further weight by additional evidence suggesting that communications from the MFM to US intelligence were transmitted first to Stockholm and then relayed to Washington via Iver C. Olsen, the American OSS operative who initially recruited Wallenberg to go to Budapest in June 1944.|$|E

500|$|Though Hemmings did {{not think}} of his work as a biography, Richard L. Hopkins (Comparative Education Review) said it {{essentially}} was strongest as one. Hopkins wrote in 1976 that Hemmings's book was the best biography of Neill available at the time, and called it [...] "comprehensive", [...] "objective", and [...] "sympathetically thoughtful". In comparison, Neill's autobiography [...] "rambles" [...] and Skidelsky's biography [...] "preens" [...] over [...] "small insights", while Hemmings unpacks larger issues to contextualize [...] "a complex man in a complex world". Reflecting on these three biographies of Neill, Hopkins added that Hemmings's book would interest [...] "comparative educators" [...] most, as that it addressed the two points readers would find most interesting about Neill: the role of his history on his ideas, and the role of his ideas in the outside world. Still, Hopkins thought many readers would find the work [...] "too long and detailed". Hopkins himself found Hemmings's book [...] "a struggle to work through", though more complete compared to Neill's [...] "easy", [...] "stream-of-consciousness" [...] prose. Leonard W. Cowie (British Journal of Educational Studies) said that Fifty Years was written with [...] "great competence" [...] and would be both [...] "interesting and essential" [...] for those interested in understanding Neill. [...] recommended the [...] "excellent volume" [...] for [...] "all readership levels", and considered it <b>more</b> <b>telling</b> than Neill's own autobiography. Shelley Neiderbach (Library Journal) agreed that Hemmings's [...] "admiring ... historical biography" [...] remained [...] "clear, cool, and evenhanded". [...] Sarah Curtis (The Times Literary Supplement) wrote in 1972 that Hemmings's account of Neill was [...] "the most lucid, dispassionate yet sympathetic" [...] published. No system, she wrote, has reconciled the needs for individual freedom and societal regulation.|$|E
2500|$|U. S. Air Force {{historian}} Stanley Falk wrote, [...] "The Papuan {{campaign was}} one of the costliest Allied victories of the Pacific war in terms of casualties per troops committed." [...] Of the 9,825 men of the 32nd Division who entered combat, the division suffered 2,520 battle casualties, including 586 killed in action. <b>More</b> <b>telling</b> was the huge number who were casualties due to illness: 7,125 (66%, with 2,952 requiring hospitalization), and 100 more died from other causes. The total casualty count of 9,956 exceeded the division's entire battle strength.|$|E
2500|$|Activist Warren Farrell {{has written}} of {{his views on}} how men are uniquely marginalized {{in what he calls}} their [...] "disposability", {{the manner in which the}} most {{dangerous}} occupations, notably soldiering and mining, were historically performed exclusively by men and remain so today. In his book, The Myth of Male Power, Farrell argues that patriarchal societies do not make rules to benefit men at the expense of women. Farrell contends that nothing is <b>more</b> <b>telling</b> about who has benefited from [...] "men's rules" [...] than life expectancy, which is lower in males, and suicide rates, which are higher in males.|$|E

2500|$|The biggest such operation, [...] "Operation Junction City" [...] in 1967 for example, {{involving}} some 22 US battalions and 4 ARVN counterparts, {{and supported}} by massive air and artillery firepower, only yielded an average of approximately 33 enemy dead per day, over its 2 months. Such losses were manageable by an opponent that could put {{tens of thousands of}} staunch fighters in the field, and reinforce them with more every day. Even <b>more</b> <b>telling,</b> such massive sweeps failed to cripple their targets and deliver the big battles sought by the Americans. The option of initiating contact was still largely in the hands of Communist units, and their tactics lured powerful US forces away from populated areas, their key base until late in the war.|$|E
2500|$|Samuel Dexter was {{a staunch}} abolitionist, {{and it is}} nearly certain that Gordon Hall was {{a stop on the}} Underground Railroad. [...] There is some {{evidence}} that Millisent Dexter employed a string of Black servants, all of whom were recent arrivals to the village and none of whom stayed for any length of time. [...] In oral histories, Samuel Dexter and his sons were identified as conductors on the Underground Railroad. [...] <b>More</b> <b>telling,</b> it has been documented that Gordon Hall once contained a secret room in the basement, accessible through a trap door on the south porch and from concealed openings in crawlspaces under the other porches. [...] Although the trap door was removed during remodeling and the [...] "secret" [...] room had doors cut to it, the passages to the crawl space remain in the house.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{surviving}} anecdote from Hephaestion’s youth comes {{courtesy of}} the Alexander Romance. According to this tale, “...one day when Alexander was 15 years old [...] sailing with Hephaestion, his friend, he easily reached Pisa [...] and {{he went off to}} stroll with Hephaestion.” That Alexander’s exact age is given provides another clue to Hephaestion’s upbringing because at fifteen Alexander and his companions were at Mieza studying under Aristotle. Hephaestion has never been named among those who attended the lectures at Mieza, but his close friendship with Alexander at that age suggests strongly that he was numbered among them. <b>More</b> <b>telling</b> is Hephaestion’s name being found in a catalogue of Aristotle’s correspondences. The letters themselves no longer exist, but for them to have found their way into an official catalogue, their content must have been of some significance. It implies that Hephaestion received a good education and shows that Aristotle was impressed enough by his pupil to send letters throughout Alexander's expanding empire to converse with him.|$|E

2500|$|However, even <b>more</b> <b>telling</b> {{than the}} {{difference}} between the details of the proposed marriages is the contrast between the two names; Bonfield in True Tragedy and Bonville in 3 Henry VI. Bonfield is never mentioned in the chronicles, and there is no known historical personage of that name. Bonville on the other hand is mentioned numerous times by both Hall and Holinshed, and is a known historical figure. However, there is a minor character named Bonfield in the Robert Greene play George a Greene, the Pinner of Wakefield (1587–1590), where {{he is a member of}} a group of staunch opponents of Edward III. George a Greene was published in quarto in 1599, and the title page states that it was performed by Sussex's Men. In 1594, Sussex's Men had performed Titus Andronicus, which, according to the title page of the 1594 quarto, was also performed by Strange's Men (i.e. Derby's Men) and Pembroke's Men. Furthermore, according to the title page of the 1595 octavo of True Tragedy, it was performed by Pembroke's Men. As such, Pembroke's Men performed both True Tragedy and Titus Andronicus, whereas Sussex's Men performed both George a Greene and Titus Andronicus, thus creating a link between True Tragedy and George a Greene, and perhaps suggesting that either Sussex's Men could have performed True Tragedy or Pembroke's Men could have performed George a Greene, or both. Taken together, the name of Bonfield [...] "in two historically unrelated texts performed by companies that shared scripts and personnel indicates that the name is a non-authorial interpolation by players." [...] That this could be the case is further supported by the fact that reported texts often use material from other plays. For example, The Contention uses material from Christopher Marlowe's The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus (c1592), Edward II (c1593) and even a line from 3 Henry VI; [...] "If our King Henry had shook hands with death" [...] (1.4.103).|$|E
