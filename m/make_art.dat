Clean up events may be organized in which participants will sometimes comb an area in a line {{to ensure that no}} litter is missed. In North America, Adopt a Highway programs are popular, in which companies and organizations commit to cleaning stretches of road. In Kiwayu, a Kenyan island, some of the collected litter (flip-flops) is used to <b>make</b> <b>art,</b> which is then sold.|$|E
25|$|Art {{therapy has}} been used in a variety of {{traumatic}} experiences, including disaster relief and crisis intervention. Art therapists have worked with children, adolescents and adults after natural and manmade disasters, encouraging them to <b>make</b> <b>art</b> in response to their experiences. Some suggested strategies for working with victims of disaster include: assessing for distress or post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), normalizing feelings, modeling coping skills, promoting relaxation skills, establishing a social support network, and increasing a sense of security and stability.|$|E
25|$|Many sculptors seek {{new ways}} and {{materials}} to <b>make</b> <b>art.</b> One of Pablo Picasso's most famous sculptures included bicycle parts. Alexander Calder and other modernists made spectacular use of painted steel. Since the 1960s, acrylics and other plastics {{have been used}} as well. Andy Goldsworthy makes his unusually ephemeral sculptures from almost entirely natural materials in natural settings. Some sculpture, such as ice sculpture, sand sculpture, and gas sculpture, is deliberately short-lived. Recent sculptors have used stained glass, tools, machine parts, hardware and consumer packaging to fashion their works. Sculptors sometimes use found objects, and Chinese scholar's rocks have been appreciated for many centuries.|$|E

25|$|Though {{her family}} objected to her {{becoming}} a professional artist, Cassatt began studying painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia {{at the early}} age of 15. Part of her parents' concern may have been Cassatt's exposure to feminist ideas and the bohemian behavior {{of some of the}} male students. Although about 20 percent of the students were female, most viewed art as a socially valuable skill; few of them were determined, as Cassatt was, to <b>make</b> <b>art</b> their career. She continued her studies from 1861 through 1865, the duration of the American Civil War. Among her fellow students was Thomas Eakins, later the controversial director of the Academy.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} is also cultural. The movement aims {{to bring a}} new look on Syria by focusing on its cultural diversity and richness, beyond ubiquitous images of despair. According to Leila Shahid for La Marseilleise, Syria is a great cultural nation, a pluricultural leader of artistic creation. Journalist Alain Laurens commented that the Syrian cultural caravan’s involvement makes the public forget during the performance about all the bombings in Aleppo and Damascus and {{make room for a}} humane and fraternal communion. It is a way of showing that the Syrian cultural scene and its artists is alive and thriving. Finally, the road trip allows the Cultural Caravan to <b>make</b> <b>art</b> and culture come to the people, therefore going upstream of artistic and cultural centralisation. Most of the time, the exhibition is set up outside, making it accessible to a greater number.|$|E
25|$|Mariano's first {{experience}} with art was at fours years old with his cousin, teaching him how to draw simple shapes. He and his brother, Jonathan Ching who would also grow up to become an artist, would spend their time to draw instead of playing outside. He was greatly influenced by the anime Mazinger Z and Voltes V which was widely popular during his youth. They would significantly affect his future works. Reaching his high school years, his parents reminded him to think carefully about his life career. They {{said there is no}} money in art and should consider medicine or engineering as career and to <b>make</b> <b>art</b> as a hobby. But despite his parents' constant reminder, Mariano still pursued the road of becoming an artist. He enrolled to a lot of art workshops to hone his skills. One of the workshops that he attended became the turn point of his life. At the art workshop which is headed by Elemer Borogan and Gina Morales, the art style of the paintings has touched him and made him to decide to switch from his fourth year engineering major to painting major in University of the Philippines. During his years in University of the Philippines, he co-founded the art group Surrounded by Water. There, he found his future wife, Yasmin Sison which {{is also a member of}} Surrounded by Water. Mariano Ching, at that time, was still new at the art scene and he has not garnered any recognition yet.|$|E

500|$|After the Chinese Civil War, Peking opera {{became a}} focal point of {{identity}} for both involved parties. When the Communist Party of China {{came to power in}} Mainland China in 1949, the newly formed government moved to bring art into line with Communist ideology, and [...] "to <b>make</b> <b>art</b> and literature a component of the whole revolutionary machine". To this end, dramatic works without Communist themes were considered subversive, and were ultimately banned during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976).|$|E

500|$|Writing for MTV, Tamar Anitai {{found the}} video [...] "highly conceptual" [...] {{and noted that}} beyond the [...] "hypnagogic imagery" [...] and [...] "expensive gallery pieces", the {{underlying}} meaning of the short film seems to be [...] "finding the beauty in the bizarre" [...] and the [...] "tension of power dynamics". She felt that Leto created a [...] "surreal visual fantasia" [...] and interpreted the colored chalk fight {{near the end of}} the video as a [...] "call to <b>make</b> <b>art,</b> not war". James Montgomery of MTV wrote that although [...] "every frame is like a photograph [...] they are all intrinsically linked". He felt that when combined, the singular images form a [...] "powerfully cohesive unit", explaining that [...] "they tell a story, convey emotions (lust, loss, sadness, desire, anger, etc) without speaking a word". Chad Childers from Loudwire commented that the meaning of the video is left open to the viewer's interpretation.|$|E

[...] In 2014, Fox spoke at TEDxBrighton, and was nominated for the alumnus award at the University of Brighton, where they were a Master of Arts student. Fox completed a Master's degree in Sequential Design and Illustration in 2015.

[...] Kim Ki-youngAlthough a critically acclaimed, financially successful independent filmmaker, Kim was not immune from governmental pressure. He filmed Ban Geum-ryeon in 1975, but it was banned at the time, and not released until 1981, with 40 minutes of footage censored. The government also coerced Kim into making an anti-Communist propaganda film. The resulting film, Love of Blood Relations (1976), transcended the bounds of propaganda by portraying the communist agent as one of Kim's typical femme fatale characters. Kim later commented, [...] "North or south, capitalist or communist, ideology is far less interesting to me than the things that divide the sexes." ...|$|E

Later, she took the concept of ArtRave and created ArtRave: The Artpop Ball tour. After abruptly cancelling the North American leg of her previous Born This Way Ball (2012–13) tour due to a major hip injury, the tour began with its first leg in the United States on May 4, 2014, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. ArtRave: The Artpop Ball had the singer visiting cities where she canceled tour dates in order to undergo the surgery, as well as playing new cities. Gaga explained to The Independent: [...] "When I'm onstage with the Artpop Ball, {{the point of the}} show is to take what was the mess of my life and <b>make</b> <b>art</b> of it – to raise the spirit of artistic dreams and creativity and take all the things I was feeling in pain about, and rage... I take a much more meditative approach to the performance. I've got wide-open ears. The ArtRave has routines, and there's a performance-art aspect that has been designed." [...] Prior {{to the beginning of the}} tour, Gaga headlined six shows (March 28, 30, 31 and April 2, 4, and 6) at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, New York, and these shows were the final performances at the venue. A seventh show was also added for April 7 and officially closed the venue.|$|E
