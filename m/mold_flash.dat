50|$|Molding flash can {{be caused}} from old or worn mold {{cavities}} that no longer fit tightly together. Other times, {{the complexity of the}} part requires so many mating pieces with such precise geometries that {{it is almost impossible to}} create a perfect fit on every impression. Most often, the type of material being molded, and its attendant viscosity in its liquid form, is the primary factor that leads to the creation of the unwanted <b>mold</b> <b>flash.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Punching in {{plastics}} fabrication usually {{refers to}} the removal of scrap plastic from the desired article. For example, in extrusion blow molding {{it is common to}} use punching dies to remove tails, <b>molding</b> <b>flash</b> (scrap plastic) and handle slugs from bottles or other molded containers.|$|R
50|$|After being cast, {{the parts}} are {{carefully}} {{removed from the}} <b>molds.</b> <b>Flashing,</b> the excess metal around the molded figure, is carefully removed and the parts are then prepared for either painting or chrome plating. The windows are vac-u-formed. Tires are made of a special rubber compound and all parts are readied for assembly. The models are assembled by hand and any additional painting such as tail lights or chrome features is done.|$|R
50|$|Flash, {{also known}} as flashing, is excess {{material}} attached to a molded, forged, or cast product, which must usually be removed. This is typically caused by leakage of the material between the two surfaces of a mold (beginning along the parting line) or between the base material and the mold (in the case of overmolding). <b>Molding</b> <b>flash</b> is seen when the optimized parameter on cull height is not calibrated. Proper design of mold parting surfaces can reduce or eliminate flash.|$|R
50|$|At {{one point}} an elegant porch {{wrapped around the}} entire length of the mansion, but this was removed for safety reasons. The porch {{contains}} a wooden plank floor with sandstone pillars. Today the only part still standing is the porch covering the carriage entrance. The porch is supported by four Ionic columns with an entablature and dentil <b>molding.</b> <b>Flashing</b> can still be seen running along the walls where the porch was once attached. The entrance is framed by a fan light and side lights with a large white solid wood door.|$|R
5000|$|Vivian Sobchack {{commented that}} Flesh Gordon is [...] "a skin flick hilariously <b>molded</b> around the <b>Flash</b> Gordon serials, and fully and lovingly aware of genre {{conventions}} from special effects to dialogue".|$|R
5000|$|Three {{types of}} molds used are the flash plunger-type, {{straight}} plunger-type, and the [...] "landed" [...] plunger-type <b>molds.</b> The <b>flash</b> type <b>mold</b> {{must have an}} accurate charge of plastic and produces a horizontal flash (excess material protruding from the mold). The straight plunger-type mold allows for some inaccuracy in the charge of plastic and produces a vertical flash. The landed plunger type mold must have an accurate charge of plastic, and no flash is produced. Further details are explained in Ref 3.|$|R
