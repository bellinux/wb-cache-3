40|$|Part 1. The {{solid state}} {{decarboxylation}} of the diammonium salt of moxalactam hydrate was studied. During degradation, this compound lost water {{followed by the}} simultaneous loss of ammonia and carbon dioxide. The proposed mechanism is postulated to involve a carbanion intermediate. ^ The solid state decarboxylation of several phenylpropanedioic acid model compounds was also studied.

This temperature was shown to increase as the electron donating ability of the group in the (alpha) -position or in the 42 ̆ 7 -position of the phenyl ring increased. Also, the half salts were shown to be more stable than the free acid. The solvent of crystalization was shown {{to play an important role}} in the degradation of the <b>monosodium</b> <b>salt</b> of 2 -phenylpropanedioic acid. ^ The desolvation of the 0. 5 benzene solvate of 42 ̆ 7 -hydroxy- 2 -phenylpropanedioic acid was studied using DSC. Benzene was shown to be held very loosely in the solvent tunnel. ^ Part II. The crystal structure of the cefaclor dihydrate was determined. The two water molecules were held differently in the crystal lattice. This dihydrate desolvated readily under low relative humidities to form the monohydrate which had a different diffraction pattern. The monohydrate desolvated with no major differences in the powder pattern. The solid state (2 ̆ 713) C NMR and the IR-spectra of the dihydrate and monohydrate were very similar. ^ The crystal structure of cefazolin pentahydrate was determined by X-ray crystallography. This structure was solved originally in a monoclinic space group (P 2 (, 1), Z = 4) and the packing of the molecules was shown to be identical with that reported by Van Meersche for the sodium chloride monohydrate of cefazolin. The water and sodium atoms of the Van Meersche structure were reassigned and the correct assignments are reported. The different forms of cefazolin (monohydrate, sesquihydrate, pentahydrate and amorphous) were analyzed and differentiated by TGA, DSC, x-ray powder diffraction, IR and (2 ̆ 713) C solid state NMR. ...|$|E

40|$|Umami taste (corresponds to savory in English) is {{elicited}} by L-glutamate, typically as its Na <b>salt</b> (<b>monosodium</b> glutamate: MSG), {{and is one}} of five basic taste {{qualities that}} {{plays a key role in}} intake of amino acids. A particular property of umami is the synergistic potentiation of glutamate by purine nucleotide monophosphates (IMP, GMP). A heterodimer of a G protein coupled receptor, TAS 1 R 1 and TAS 1 R 3, is proposed to function as its receptor. However, little is known about genetic variation of TAS 1 R 1 and TAS 1 R 3 and its potential links with individual differences in umami sensitivity. Here we investigated the association between recognition thresholds for umami substances and genetic variations in human TAS 1 R 1 and TAS 1 R 3, and the functions of TAS 1 R 1 /TAS 1 R 3 variants using a heterologous expression system. Our study demonstrated that the TAS 1 R 1 - 372 T creates a more sensitive umami receptor than - 372 A, while TAS 1 R 3 - 757 C creates a less sensitive one than - 757 R for MSG and MSG plus IMP, and showed a strong correlation between the recognition thresholds and in vitro dose - response relationships.
