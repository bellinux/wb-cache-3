5|$|The role of stay-at-home dad may be {{difficult}} for men who feel as though they had no option. It is hard for these men to adapt from being a financial provider in the family to being a homemaker. Men who willingly choose to become a stay-at-home dad are much <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> their role in the family.|$|E

25|$|David R. Hekman {{and colleagues}} {{found that men}} receive {{significantly}} higher customer satisfaction scores than equally well-performing women. Customers who viewed videos featuring a female and a male actor {{playing the role of}} an employee helping a customer were 19% <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the male employee's performance and also were <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the store's cleanliness and appearance although the actors performed identically, read the same script, and were in exactly the same location with identical camera angles and lighting. In a second study, they found that male doctors were rated as more approachable and competent than equally well performing female doctors. They interpret their findings to suggest that customer ratings tend to be inconsistent with objective indicators of performance and should not be uncritically used to determine pay and promotion opportunities. They contend that customer biases have potential adverse effects on female employees' careers.|$|E
25|$|Prospective {{memory is}} {{required}} to remember when to take oral contraceptive pills. A study performed by Matter and Meier (2008) showed that women who self-reported higher prospective memory ability were <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> oral contraceptive use and experienced lower stress levels. Having better memory makes {{it is easier for}} these women to remind themselves to take their contraceptives at the required time of the day.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies suggest}} people with secure {{attachment}} styles have longer-lasting relationships. This may be {{partly due to}} commitment. People with secure attachment styles tend to express more commitment to their relationships. People with secure attachment styles {{also tend to be}} <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> their relationships, which may encourage them to stay in their relationships longer. However, secure attachment styles are by no means a guarantee of long-lasting relationships.|$|E

25|$|These {{professionals}} typically conceptualize, create, consult, and supervise. As a result, {{upper middle}} class employees enjoy great autonomy {{in the work place}} and are <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> their careers than non-professional middle class individuals. In terms of financial wealth income, the professional middle class fits in the top third, but seldom reach the top 5% of American society. According to sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert, James Henslin, Joseph Hickey, and William Thompson, the {{upper middle class}} constitutes 15% of the population.|$|E
25|$|Working-class Americans {{as well as}} many {{of those}} in the middle class may also face {{occupation}} alienation. In contrast to upper-middle-class professionals who are mostly hired to conceptualize, supervise and share their thoughts, many Americans enjoy only little autonomy or creative latitude in the workplace. As a result, white collar professionals tend to be significantly <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> their work. More recently those {{in the center of the}} income strata, who may still identify as middle class, have faced increasing economic insecurity, supporting the idea of a working-class majority.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate {{government}} decided {{to attempt a}} strategic reversal in the West by sending Bragg reinforcements from Virginia—Lt. Gen. James Longstreet with two divisions from his First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia—in addition to the reinforcements from Mississippi. Chickamauga was the first large scale Confederate movement of troops from one theater to another {{with the aim of}} achieving a period of numerical superiority and gaining decisive results. Bragg was now <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the resources provided, and looked to strike the Union Army as soon as he achieved the strength he needed.|$|E

25|$|His last commercially {{available}} project, Papa Woody, {{was released in}} 1996 under the name Ether Bunny, although it was basically a solo effort. Serving as his personal tribute to the cartoon and jazz music, Vahnke claims to have been <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> his work on Papa Woody than on any Vampire Rodents album. A collaboration with Athan Maroulis called Alchemia, later renamed Obsidian, was planned for release in 1997 but never came into fruition. The overall project {{was described as a}} SBC and LTG approach to The Blue Nile with string orchestra. Also, a completely instrumental Vampire Rodent album was completed the same year, but like the Alcemia/Obsidian project was shelved indefinitely.|$|E
500|$|The {{third part}} of Who's Your City? {{examines}} {{the role of}} [...] "where someone lives" [...] as a factor of happiness.

[...] In addition, renters are slightly <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> their living arrangements than home owners, and people are generally satisfied with where they live.|$|E

Black was also <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the vocals on this album. Several of the songs on The Hard Way, including [...] "Burn One Down", were initially reported to be Black's responses to his situation with Ham. [...] Co writer Nicholas refuted the rumors, maintaining that most of those songs were written in the late 1980s.|$|E

40|$|This study {{responds}} {{to calls for}} research on work-family aspects in entrepreneurship research. Our study examined the role of work-family conflict and enhancement on small business owners’ (SBOs) wellbeing. We found work-family has negative direct effect on mental health, job and family satisfactions. Furthermore, we found that under high level of work-family conflict condition, SBOs who perceive a greater level of work-family enhancement would feel <b>more</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>with</b> their life, job as well as family aspects. Interestingly, under high level of conflict, even SBOs perceive greater level of enhancement, it would not lessen {{the negative impact of}} the conflict on their mental health. These results suggest that once psychological health is harmed by work-family conflict, its negative consequences remain unchanged...|$|R
500|$|David has no {{obligation}} {{to share with the}} Finley & Figg partners the proceeds of this case, which was his own initiative. However, his sense of loyalty prevents him from leaving an ailing firm and ailing fellows in the lurch. David returns to the office and tells Oscar and Wally of his settlement. He offers to pay the debts left from the Krayoxx fiasco, amounting to $200,000 and pays off the mortgage on the firm's office building, gives the loyal secretary Rochelle a $100,000 bonus and splits the remaining $1.2 million evenly with them (a far more generous settlement than they planned to give him, had the Krayoxx money come in). In return, the three of them are to sign a 12-month contract to enter an equal partnership and will no longer be an ambulance-chasing firm. A bit embarrassed, Oscar and Wally agree to the new contract. However, the two of them can't really function under these new terms, and later that year the partnership falls apart. Finley begins spending less time in the office and eventually retires a happy man, having recently remarried and being much <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> his new wife, while Figg packs up and moves to Alaska. [...] Zinc opens his own product liability practice, David E. Zinc, Attorney-at-Law and hires Rochelle as his new secretary. Soon winning two further lead poisoning cases, he seems well embarked on a professionally and financially satisfying career.|$|E

2500|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{individuals}} in high quality relationships, in which partners feel attached and committed to each other, should evidence more motivation to provide responsive support to their partner. Indeed, one’s own sense of relationship satisfaction [...] and relationship interdependence (the {{degree to which the}} caregiver feels close and committed to the partner) are positively related to the amount of support one provides. For example, daily diary studies of caregiving have observed that individuals tend to provide more support to their partners on days they feel <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> their relationships (however, a reverse interpretation – that caregiving increases relationship satisfaction – is also possible). In addition, caregivers who are <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> their relationships report more altruistic motives for providing support.|$|E
