25|$|A {{collaboration}} {{is like a}} good conversation, Nicola came to <b>my</b> <b>studio</b> {{a couple of times}} and I went to hers; we initially chatted about her music, the forthcoming album and how this related to her vision for the shoes. I went away and started designing my response to this. After our first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, I knew it would be interesting and fun to work together.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, Blue Horse {{became friends}} with the noted artist Elbridge Ayer (E.A.) Burbank while he was visiting the Pine Ridge Agency. Burbank painted sitting portraits of the {{greatest}} Native American leaders, including Geronimo, Sitting Bull, Red Cloud and Chief Joseph. Burbank painted more than 1200 portraits of Native Americans from 125 tribes. At the time, Blue Horse was eighty {{years of age and}} rode each day on his horse to pose for Burbank, who he called “Son of the Shadow-Maker.” Burbank was also an historian and his fond recollections illuminate Blue Horse. “Hardly a day passed without Blue Horse coming to <b>my</b> <b>studio</b> to visit me. He would sit down and smoke a little, short, strong pipe and gossip with the other Indians present; all the time he was talking he would be fanning himself with the wing of a turkey. His face usually was painted red, and he wore all the Indian clothes he had, with a single feather on his head. He was a thorough Indian, and extremely kind-hearted. His principal object in life was to try to make others happy around him.” Burbank recorded his stories of Blue Horse.|$|E
500|$|The {{limitations}} of devising the album's musical direction {{on a tour}} bus forced Reznor to work differently from usual. Reznor said, [...] "I didn't have guitars around {{because it was too}} much hassle... It was another creative limitation... If I were in <b>my</b> <b>studio,</b> I would have done things the way I normally do them. But not having the ability to do that forced me into trying some things that were fun to do." ...|$|E

Reminiscent of Chase's en plein air paintings, the dark background contrasts with the enigmatic, illuminated woman. <b>My</b> <b>Studio</b> (1891)—which depicts her father in an room with [...] "elaborately patterned textiles", antique and oriental furnishings, and flowers—is [...] "the most impressive" [...] of her works at the Fitchburg Art Museum.

500|$|Petrucci {{has called}} Portnoy's {{departure}} {{one of the}} hardest things Dream Theater have had to face, and speaking of when he first heard the news, Jordan Rudess recounted, [...] "You know, just to give you an idea of how deep this was to lose him, how difficult it was... after we got off the phone with him... I literally sat on the steps of <b>my</b> <b>studio</b> and cried. This is a guy who's a friend of mine, who we all love and admire. We didn't want to see it come crashing down." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{misconception}} circulated at {{the time}} that the painting had been inspired by Swinburne's poem. In a letter to a newspaper, Whistler refuted this, while still showing his respect for Swinburne's work; [...] "those lines" [...] he wrote [...] "were only written, in <b>my</b> <b>studio,</b> after the picture was painted. And the writing of them was a rare and graceful tribute from the poet to the painter – a noble recognition of work by the production of a nobler one." [...] Swinburne repaid the compliment: [...] "...whatever merit my song may have, it is not so complete in beauty, in tenderness and significance, in exquisite execution and delicate strength, as Whistler's picture..." ...|$|E

500|$|After Carey {{finished}} {{writing and}} producing the track alongside Williams, Dogg added his rap verse, and added some ulterior beats and components. Before taking the still-uncompleted song to the studio, Dogg described {{the song and}} beat [...] "The beat was just sick and it was bangin'. I was like, 'All right, give me that, M.C.' I took [...] down to <b>my</b> <b>studio</b> and flipped my style to it." [...] After slightly altering the song, as well as adding his verses, Dogg met with Carey once again for her approval on the song, [...] "When I played [...] for her, she was like, 'Oh, I love it!'

500|$|Within {{the day of}} the song's release, via World Wide Web, listeners, {{unaware of}} the song's background, drew {{comparisons}} of the song to Sa-Fire's [...] "I Never Heard." [...] Soon after, media outlets The New York Times and TMZ.com informed Anka of the similarities between the songs. In response, Anka told the New York Times, that [...] "This Is It" [...] was [...] "exactly the same song" [...] as [...] "I Never Heard" [...] and only the titles were different. He also stated that he was planning on taking legal action against Jackson's estate. Soon afterwards, Jackson's estate acknowledged that Anka was a co-writer on the song and agreed that Anka would receive 50 percent of the publishing rights from it. Anka said the estate [...] "did the right thing," [...] and that he felt that he did not think [...] "that anybody tried to do the wrong thing [...] " [...] and it was [...] "an honest mistake." [...] Anka further stated [...] "They realize it's a mistake, they realize it's my song, they realize it's my production of his vocal in <b>my</b> <b>studio</b> and I am getting 50 percent of the whole project, actually, which is fair." ...|$|E

The {{painting}} {{was inspired by a}} scene Courbet witnessed on the roadside. He later explained to Champfleury and the writer Francis Wey: [...] "It is not often that one encounters so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting.

Nick recorded his new record at <b>my</b> <b>studio,</b> and then he was going to drop off some records and he said, 'Hey, need anyone to sing backup?' And I was like, 'Actually, yeah, come on in.'

Chmerkovskiy said he chose New Jersey because there was a plethora of dance studios that he disliked already established in Brooklyn. The studio relocated a few times until it ended up in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. He said in 2011 of choosing a New Jersey location, [...] "I didn't want to open a studio that would become just one of the studios in the area.

2500|$|... 1863 was {{to alter}} the course of Alma-Tadema's {{personal}} and professional life: on 3 January his invalid mother died, and on 24 September he was married, in Antwerp City Hall, to Marie-Pauline Gressin Dumoulin, the daughter of Eugène Gressin Dumoulin, a French journalist living near Brussels. Nothing is known of their meeting and little of Pauline herself, as Alma-Tadema never spoke about her after her death in 1869. Her image appears {{in a number of}} oils, though he painted her portrait only three times, the most notable appearing in <b>My</b> <b>studio</b> (1867). The couple had three children. Their eldest and only son lived only a few months dying of smallpox. Their two daughters, Laurence (1864–1940) and Anna (1867–1943), both had artistic leanings: the former in literature, the latter in art. Neither would marry.|$|E
