5|$|A {{superphylum}} – TACK – {{has been}} proposed that includes the Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Korarchaeota.

5|$|Improvement of {{neurological}} function usually occurs {{for two or}} {{more years}} after the trauma. For many years {{it was believed that}} recovery was fastest during the first six months, but {{there is no evidence to}} support this. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> services commonly being withdrawn after this period, rather than any physiological limitation to further progress. Children recover better in the immediate time frame and improve for longer periods.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about sivaladapid ecology. Gingerich and Sahni {{suggested}} that Indraloris was probably arboreal and {{that it may have}} been more frugivorous (eating fruit) than Sivaladapis, which they interpreted as a folivore (leaf-eater). Flynn and Morgan interpreted I.kamlialensis as a mixed feeder. The Late Miocene extinction of Indian sivaladapids <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> a decline in forest cover in Asia and to competition by immigrating colobine monkeys.|$|E
5|$|Many {{psychological}} mechanisms {{have been}} implicated {{in the development and}} maintenance of schizophrenia. Cognitive biases have been identified in those with the diagnosis or those at risk, especially when under stress or in confusing situations. Some cognitive features may reflect global neurocognitive deficits such as memory loss, while others <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> particular issues and experiences.|$|E

5|$|Other cell-death {{mechanisms}} include proteasomal and lysosomal system dysfunction {{and reduced}} mitochondrial activity.

5|$|Pentastomida is {{an enigmatic}} group of parasites that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> maxillopod crustaceans. One species, Porocephalus crotali, is {{known from the}} marsh rice rat.

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{begins its}} breeding season {{later in the}} year than any other finch and later than any other native North American bird, besides occasionally the sedge wren. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the abundance of seeds in the late summer months, as seeds represent the majority of their diet.|$|E

5|$|The English {{proper name}} Sun {{developed}} from Old English sunne and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> south. Cognates to English sun appear in other Germanic languages, including Old Frisian sunne, sonne, Old Saxon sunna, Middle Dutch sonne, modern Dutch zon, Old High German sunna, modern German Sonne, Old Norse sunna, and Gothic sunnō. All Germanic terms for the Sun stem from Proto-Germanic *sunnōn.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{legend of}} the jackalope, upon which the Wyoming taxidermists were building, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> similar stories in other cultures and other historical times. Researchers suggest {{that at least some}} of the tales of horned hares were inspired by sightings of rabbits infected with the Shope papilloma virus. It causes horn- and antler-like tumors to grow in various places on a rabbit's head and body.|$|E
5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the species}} is widely {{regarded}} as sexually monomorphic, males have been suggested to grow more quickly, and in some naturally occurring strains, males are noted to possess dark blotches on the base of their dorsal fins. The species reaches sexual maturity around one year of age, and continues to reproduce for 9–10 years. Frequency and timing of spawning <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the occurrence of rain. A. ocellatus fish are biparental substrate spawners, though detailed information regarding their reproduction in the wild is scarce.|$|E
5|$|Cannabis {{can be a}} {{contributory}} {{factor in}} schizophrenia, potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk. The increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual or <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> preexisting psychopathology. Early exposure is strongly {{associated with an increased}} risk. The size of the increased risk is not clear, but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis. Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased risk of chronic psychoses.|$|E
5|$|Cross-linguistically, the-ma suffix <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> a coverbial suffix in Jaminjung, a {{language}} in which coverb roots occur without any aspect markers, but are then suffixed with -mayan, which marks continuous aspect. This coverb suffix bears {{a striking resemblance to}} the sum of the Wagiman -ma suffix and the continuous aspect suffix -yan, which always occur in tandem on coverbs. Together, -ma and -yan perform the same semantic function as Jaminjung -mayan. Precisely what the relationship holds between these suffixes; whether one language borrowed from the other, or whether each language inherited them from earlier languages, is not at all clear.|$|E

5|$|Incapillo {{is part of}} a {{volcanic}} system active between 3.5 and 2mya that includes Ojos del Salado and Nevado Tres Cruces. It was the last volcanic centre formed in the region; subsequently, the shallowing of the subducting slab prevented volcanism east and south of it. Another volcanic trend considers Incapillo as part of a northeastsouthwest trend with Cerro Galan and Cerro Blanco. This trend <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> delamination of the lower crust. Also, these centres are located between two domains of different rigidity, an Ordovician sedimentary domain of low rigidity and a higher rigidity basement.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Glaser, a local {{technician}} {{armed with}} a FLIR device, joins Fazekas, Mulder, and Scully on {{a search for the}} creature. They soon spot two creatures on the FLIR which travel in separate directions, causing the four to split up. Fazekas is attacked and disappears. Mulder deduces from this that the creatures <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the Mothman of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. After a brief encounter with the creatures, Glaser takes off running and is swiftly killed by a creature. Mulder is grabbed by the other creature, though it releases him after Scully manages to wound it with her firearm.|$|E
5|$|The Spinozistic {{conception}} of a conatus was a historical precursor to modern theories of autopoiesis in biological systems. In systems theory and the sciences in general, {{the concept of a}} conatus <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the phenomenon of emergence, whereby complex systems may spontaneously form from multiple simpler structures. The self-regulating and self-maintaining properties of biological and even social systems may thus be considered modern versions of Spinoza's conatus principle; however, the scope of the idea is definitely narrower today without the religious implications of the earlier variety.|$|E
