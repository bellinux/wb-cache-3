25|$|Asphalt {{was used}} {{starting}} in the 1960s as an hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds. Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alpha-emitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in France, Belgium and Japan, but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues (risks of fire, as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan) and long-term stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations. One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation {{because of the presence}} of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis. A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a semi-permeable membrane. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised <b>medium-level</b> <b>waste.</b> When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as selenium, technetium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded anions. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging.|$|E

40|$|This article compares {{different}} strategies for handling low- and <b>medium-level</b> nuclear <b>waste</b> {{buried in a}} retired potassium mine in Germany (Asse II) that faces significant risk of uncontrollable brine intrusion and, hence, long-term groundwater contamination. We survey the policy process {{that has resulted in}} the identification of three possible so-called decommissioning options: complete backfilling, relocation of the waste to deeper levels in the mine, and retrieval. The selection of a decommissioning strategy must compare expected investment costs with expected social damage costs (economic, environmental, and health damage costs) caused by flooding and subsequent groundwater contamination. We apply a cost minimization approach that accounts for the uncertainty regarding the stability of the rock formation and the risk of an uncontrollable brine intrusion. Since economic and health impacts stretch out into the far future, we examine the impact of different discounting methods and rates. Due to parameter uncertainty, we conduct a sensitivity analysis concerning key assumptions. We find that retrieval, the currently preferred option by policymakers, has the lowest expected social damage costs for low discount rates. However, this advantage is overcompensated by higher expected investment costs. Considering all costs, backfilling is the best option for all discounting scenarios considered...|$|R

Between 1967 and 1978 low-level and intermediate-level radioactive waste were emplaced in 13 chambers in the Asse II mine. Two chambers are located in the middle part and ten in the southern flank of the mine at depths from 725 m to 750 m below surface. Between 1972 and 1977, exclusively <b>medium-level</b> radioactive <b>waste</b> was emplaced in a chamber on the 511 m level. Research was stopped in 1995; between 1995 and 2004 cavities were filled with salt.After media reports in 2008 about brine contaminated with radioactive caesium-137, plutonium and strontium, politicians accused the operator, Helmholtz Zentrum München - German Research Center for Environmental Health, of not having informed the inspecting authorities. On 8 September 2008, the responsible ministers of Lower Saxony and the German government replaced the operator with Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz - the Federal Office for Radiation Protection. In 2009, Greenpeace published a letter of the Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz to the German Bundesumweltministerium from 1996 in which the former had warned the latter that there is the risk of severe radioactive contamination if the mine runs full of water and that further investigation is urgently needed.|$|R

40|$|Radioactive {{contamination}} {{is generally}} {{considered one of the}} most dangerous pollutants on living organisms, which suffer without feeling it here lies the danger state. Radioactive material caused general disorder in the outside and inside of the cell. This means that this caused disorder in the biological system of the living cell. Pollution is caused by the exposure to contaminated air or water due to leak of one of those materials. Isotopes are one of the major pollutants in Iraq. Accordingly, the radioactive waste can be divided into three important classes. The first category is the low-level waste can be eliminated by mixing with broken glass powder and packaged in metal. The second class is the <b>medium-level</b> <b>waste</b> which can be eliminated by storing in metal buried in the wells in a deep saline where its radiation vanishes after a long period of time, and the third is the high-level waste which can be eliminated by storing them in metal cans covered by lead and stored in very deep wells.

40|$|Various U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) low and <b>medium-level</b> {{radioactive}} <b>waste</b> sites contain {{mixtures of}} heavy metals, radionuclides and assorted organic materials. In addition, {{there are numerous}} sites {{around the world that}} are contaminated with a mixture of organic and inorganic contaminants. In most sites, over time, water infiltrates the wastes, and releases metals, radionuclides and other contaminants causing transport into the surrounding environment. We investigated the role of fermentative microorganisms in such sites that may control metal, radionuclide and organics migration from source zones. The project was initiated based on the following overarching hypothesis: Metals, radionuclides and other contaminants can be mobilized by infiltration of water into waste storage sites. Microbial communities of lignocellulose degrading and fermenting microorganisms present in the subsurface of contaminated DOE sites can significantly impact migration by directly reducing and immobilizing metals and radionuclides while degrading complex organic matter to low molecular weight organic compounds. These low molecular weight organic acids and alcohols can increase metal and radionuclide mobility by chelation (i. e., certain organic acids) or decrease mobility by stimulating respiratory metal reducing microorganisms. We demonstrated that fermentative organisms capable of affecting the fate of Cr 6 +, U 6 + and trinitrotoluene can be isolated from organic-rich low level waste sites as well as from less organic rich subsurface environments. The mechanisms, pathways and extent of contaminant transformation depend on a variety of factors related to the type of organisms present, the aqueous chemistry as well as the geochemistry and mineralogy. This work provides observations and quantitative data across multiple scales that identify and predict the coupled effects of fermentative carbon and electron flow on the transport of radionuclides, heavy metals and organic contaminants in the subsurface; a primary concern of the DOE Environmental Remediation Science Division (ERSD) and Subsurface Geochemical Research (SBR) Program...|$|R
40|$|Clays {{and clay}} stones {{comprise}} about 50 % of all sediments and sedimentary rocks on earth. However, {{due to their}} very small grain-sizes (usually less than 2 μm in diameter) {{as well as the}} sensitivity of many clay minerals towards water, their direct microstructural characterization is still challenging. The Boom Clay and the Ypresian clays are the two reference materials for research on the long-term disposal of high- and <b>medium-level,</b> long-lived radioactive <b>waste</b> in a deep geological formation in Belgium (Van Marcke et al., 2005; ONDRAF/NIRAS, 2013 a; Verhoef and Schroeder, 2011; Verhoef et al., 2011). Therefore, the detailed characterization of their pore space is indispensable to gain a full understanding of the relevant processes, governing the transport of radionuclides in these materials (i. e. diffusion, adsorption and migration of radionuclides as well as fluid flow). In the present study, research was carried out on representative samples of the Boom Clay at Mol- 1 (Mol-Dessel research site, Belgium; Zeelmaekers, 2011 sample series, chapters 4, 5 and 7) and the Ypresian clays at Kallo- 1 (Belgium, chapters 6 and 7), covering end members with regard to mineralogical compositions and grain-size distributions. Recent progress in ion-beam milling tools has revolutionized the microstructural analysis of fine-grained geomaterials. To characterize the microstructure and pore space in Boom Clay and the Ypresian clays, down to the nm-scale resolution in 2 D and in 3 D, in the present study, focused- (FIB) and broad-ion-beam (BIB) milling were combined with high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray μ-CT and Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). Direct insights to pore space morphologies in 2 D were obtained by BIB-milling in combination with high resolution SEM (chapters 4, 6 and 7), whereas a combination of FIB serial cross-sectioning with simultaneous SEM-imaging, X-ray μ-CT and pore network extraction modeling (PNE; Dong and Blunt, 2009) delivered insight to pore space morphologies and the connectivity of the pore space in 3 D (chapter 5). MIP was used to relate direct microstructural observations within limited areas or volumes of investigation to bulk sample porosity measurements (chapter 4). Moreover, Wood’s metal injection in combination with cooled BIB-milling and high resolution SEM-imaging was used to analyze the connectivity of the pore space and visualize the impact of high pressure liquid metal injection on the porosity and microstructures of fine-grained, argillaceous geomaterials (chapter 7). Results show characteristic pore morphologies and total observed 2 D porosities within different mineral phases of the Boom Clay (chapter 4). These are similar for samples of different mineralogical composition and grain-size distribution and irrespective of the depth of origin of the samples. Largest pores were found to occur preferentially at the boundaries between clay-matrix and non-clay mineral (NCM) – mostly quartz – grains and their sizes seem to depend {{on the size of the}} adjacent NCM-grains. Therefore, total BIB-SEM observed porosities are suggested to depend significantly on a sample’s mineralogical composition and grain-size distribution. The overall distribution of porosity within a sample can be modeled based on the distribution of different mineral phases within the sample and the grain-size distribution of the material. In fine-grained, clay-rich (> 50 dry wt. -% clay minerals) Boom Clay the intra-clay matrix porosity contributes to the major fraction of the total porosity and moreover, controls the overall connectivity of the pore space. In more coarse-grained, non-clay mineral-rich (> 50 dry wt. -% non-clay minerals) samples on the contrary, larger inter-aggregate pores account for the major fraction of the total resolved porosity and also significantly contribute to the overall pore space connectivity. Once these larger inter-aggregate pores are directly connected to each other, this might increase the permeability of the material to a large extent. In general it was distinguished between two different porosity and pore space connectivity regimes: (1) a highly connected pore space within the clay-matrix with pore throats mostly below 100 nm in diameter and (2) larger inter-aggregate pores at the boundaries between clay-matrix and non-clay mineral grains with pore throats > 1 μm in diameter, but with a significantly lower interconnectivity at the scales of observation of FIB-SEM, BIB-SEM and X-ray μ-CT. Pore-size distribution analyses in 2 D and 3 D reveal power-law distributions of pore-sizes in Boom Clay over about 6 orders of magnitude, hinting towards scale invariance and self-similarity of the pore space characteristics and towards the possibility of up-scaling of our nm- to μm-scale observations to much larger scale characteristics of the formation (chapters 4 and 5). 2 D BIB-SEM is essential to bridge the gap in observational scales between 3 D X-ray μ-CT and FIB-SEM tomography and moreover, to select suitable spots for FIB-SEM porosity analyses (chapter 5). Comparing the results of porosity analyses on the Boom Clay and the Ypresian clays shows similar microstructures and pore space morphologies within the clay-matrix of the fine-grained, clay-rich samples, whereas in more coarse-grained, NCM-rich Ypresian clay samples, significantly different pore space morphologies were observed (chapters 4 and 6). Porosity distributions in the Ypresian clays seem to be bi-modal, whereas in the Boom Clay unimodal porosity distributions were observed. Results of Wood’s metal injection substantiate the high connectivity of the pore space in Boom Clay and the Ypresian clays (chapter 7). In the future, BIB-SEM observed porosities, pore morphologies, pore-size distributions and information on the pore space connectivity should be used to model bulk sample physical properties, such as permeability, diffusivity and electrical resistivity as well as single and multi-phase fluid flow and the migration of radionuclides in the analyzed materials...|$|R
