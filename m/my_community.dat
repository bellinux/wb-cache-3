500|$|On the {{recommendation}} of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired {{out of law school}} as an assistant district attorney under New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau starting in 1979. [...] She said at the time that she did so with conflicted emotions: [...] "There was a tremendous amount of pressure from <b>my</b> <b>community,</b> from the third world community, at Yale. They could not understand why I was taking this job. I'm not sure I've ever resolved that problem." [...] It was a time of crisis-level crime rates and drug problems in New York, Morgenthau's staff was overburdened with cases, and like other rookie prosecutors, Sotomayor was initially fearful of appearing before judges in court. [...] Working in the trial division, she handled heavy caseloads as she prosecuted everything from shoplifting and prostitution to robberies, assaults, and murders. She also worked on cases involving police brutality. She was not afraid to venture into tough neighborhoods or endure squalid conditions in order to interview witnesses. [...] In the courtroom, she was effective at cross examination and at simplifying a case in ways to which a jury could relate. [...] In 1983 in her highest profile case she helped convict the [...] "Tarzan Murderer" [...] (who acrobatically entered apartments, robbed them, and shot residents for no reason). [...] She felt lower-level crimes were largely products of socioeconomic environment and poverty, but she had a different attitude about serious felonies: [...] "No matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous." [...] Hispanic-on-Hispanic crime was of particular concern to her: [...] "The saddest crimes for me were the ones that my own people committed against each other." [...] In general, she showed a passion for bringing law and order to the streets of New York, displaying special zeal in pursuing child pornography cases, unusual for the time. [...] She worked 15-hour days and gained a reputation for being driven and for her preparedness and fairness. [...] One of her job evaluations labelled her a [...] "potential superstar". Morgenthau later described her as [...] "smart, hard-working, [...] a lot of common sense," [...] and as a [...] "fearless and effective prosecutor." [...] She stayed a typical length of time in the post and had a common reaction to the job: [...] "After a while, you forget there are decent, law-abiding people in life." ...|$|E
50|$|In October 2002, {{the governments}} set aside 580 km² (224 mi²) {{for the use}} of the native peoples, the Khomani San and <b>Mier</b> <b>communities.</b> This was divided between 277.69 km² of San Heritage Land and 301.34 km² of Mier Heritage Land. The South African National Parks (SANParks) manages the land under contract. The {{settlement}} agreement also provided for the communities to receive funds for the specific purpose of constructing a tourism facility. The lodge was named !Xaus Lodge (meaning 'heart' in the local language) and is managed commercially on behalf of the ‡Khomani San and <b>Mier</b> <b>communities</b> by Transfrontier Parks Destinations.|$|R
40|$|The {{restitution}} of land to the Khomani San "bushmen" and <b>Mier</b> "agricultural" <b>communities</b> in May 2002 {{marked a}} significant shift in conservation in the Kgalagadi area in South Africa. The Khomani San and <b>Mier</b> <b>communities</b> were awarded land {{inside and outside the}} Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. Given that the Khomani San interact more with nature, biodiversity conservation will only benefit from the land restitution in this case if the Khomani San are good environmental stewards. Therefore, this paper uses the contingent valuation method to investigate the values assigned to biodiversity conserved under the various forms of land tenure arrangements by the Khomani San in the Kgalagadi area and compares them to similar valuations by the adjacent <b>Mier</b> <b>community.</b> The proposed conservation programme sought to plant as many native trees, shrubs and grasslands as required to reduce biodiversity loss by 10 % in terms of the quantities of each of the selected major species of the area. Despite the fact that the conservation programme has both winners and losers when implemented under any of the three land tenure arrangements considered, the findings suggest that the Khomani San, whose attitudes towards modern conservation have not been evaluated until now, and the adjacent <b>Mier</b> <b>community</b> generally attach a significant economic value to biodiversity in their area. The net economic value for conserving biodiversity under the various forms of land tenure arrangements by the Khomani San ranged from R 928 to R 4 672 relative to the <b>Mier</b> <b>community’s</b> range of R 25 600 to R 64 000. However, for both communities, in order for all members of the local communities to support biodiversity conservation unconditionally, mechanisms for fair distribution of the associated costs and benefits should be put in place. biodiversity, contingent valuation, Khomani San, Kgalagadi, land restitution...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} {{motivated}} by the following musings of a hypothetical planner: If only I {{could find a way}} to monitor reliably, frequently, and inexpensively what was tran-spiring in <b>my</b> <b>community’s</b> neighborhoods!

But what indicator gives me an accu-rate, annually updated barometer of a wide range of neighborhood demographic, social, economic, and housing characteristics? Can I afford to collect the data to operationalize such a robust indicator? Acknowledging the validity and importance of these musings, we aim in this article to provide the answers. Accordingly, our approach will be unabashedly practical and empirical, not theoretical. Development of quantitative social indicators has been the subject of serious schol...|$|R

40|$|Being {{part of the}} semi-arid, {{southern}} Kalahari, the Mier {{area has}} a complex and sensitive ecosystem, with a low carrying capacity. Factors, such as population growth, uneconomical farm units and restricted communal areas, have resulted in serious degradation of the natural resource base. Due to their strong agricultural history, the <b>Mier</b> <b>community</b> is generally still perceived as being agriculturally inclined, which easily leads to an overall main objective, namely "to stabilising the <b>Mier</b> <b>community</b> in their agricultural environment". Development and assistance initiatives mostly focus on the natural resource base. The majority of the <b>Mier</b> <b>community,</b> however, has undergone an evolutionary process which has changed their attitudes to agriculture. In {{order to determine the}} current role of agriculture, this study aims to identify the livelihood strategies of the <b>Mier</b> <b>community</b> in the dynamic sphere of conditions and trends, livelihood resources as well as institutional and organisational structures. The main socio-economic results are as follows: (a) forty-two percent of the total economically active age (EAA) group is unemployed, with the highest rate under EAA persons younger than 30, i. e. 58 %; (b) households diversify in {{one or more of the}} following livelihood sustaining activities: (i) casual labour (49 %), (ii) government allowances (50 %), (iii) livestock agriculture (46 %), (iv) permanent work (28 %), (v) migrancy (33 %), (vi) fruit/vegetable/pasture production for own consumption (28 %), (vii) support through private transfers (21 %), and (viii) small scale trading activities (11 %); (c) households perceive the following as their most important livelihood strategies: government allowances for 43 % of all households, permanent work for 21 %, casual labour for 16 % and livestock for only 10 % of all households. The following results from this study indicate that the role of agriculture is declining. (a) Fifty-four percent of the community do not own livestock. (b) Only 39 % of people who are not full time involved in agriculture, are very interested in farming, 19 % are fairly interested and 42 % are not interested. Only 4 % of the grade 10 - 12 pupils are very interested, 42 % fairly interested and 54 % not interested in agriculture. (c) None of the communal farmers regard their livestock as their main livelihood strategy. For them, livestock mainly playa supplementary role, supplying milk and sometimes meat. (d) For every 55 persons who perceive a lack of land as the major problem of the Mier area, 100 persons believe that it is rather a lack of employment opportunities. It is concluded that the image of the <b>Mier</b> <b>community</b> as being a farming community should change to a community looking urgently for alternative livelihood opportunities. Support through agricultural assistance would only benefit a limited part of the community and it would exclude many of the poorest households.
