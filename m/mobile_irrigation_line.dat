40|$|Large <b>mobile</b> <b>irrigation</b> {{machines}} {{are becoming a}} common sight in Australian broadacre irrigation, replacing traditional surface methods. These machines give the potential of irrigating large areas with high efficiency and with a uniformity of above 80 % when designed correctly. A major component of the large <b>mobile</b> <b>irrigation</b> machine is the sprinkler application package commissioned with the machine. Pressure regulators are becoming a common {{part of the package}} when large <b>mobile</b> <b>irrigation</b> {{machines are}} commissioned. Pressure regulators are installed upstream of the nozzle and provide a constant output pressure regardless of the input pressure into the pressure regulator. The device acts as a variable headloss. Input pressure changes are a common occurrence on large <b>mobile</b> <b>irrigation</b> machines and typically are from topographic changes as the machines travel through the field. The application rate is directly influenced by the output pressure from the pressure regulator, thus this shows the importance of accurately understanding to performance of the pressure regulator. Reviewing previous literature it was known that the methodology development was a crucial part in understanding the pressure regulator performance. The development of a solid robust methodology was the primary objective of this dissertation. Eight stages of testing occurred each with incremental changes to develop the methodology for testing. The way the testing was undertaking proved to influence the results of the test. A statistical analysis in terms of an ANOVA and sample size calculations was undertaken on a limited set of data. It was found the for the 16 pressure regulators tested the means were not equal. 88 pressure regulators were found to be tested to understand manufacturing variation based on the normal model. The methodology by which the test was carried out was found to influence the outcome of the pressure regulator. Each result needs to be interpreted with reference to the methodology. Much more testing is needed to fully understand the pressure regulators performance and how they function on large <b>mobile</b> <b>irrigation</b> machines. ...|$|R

40|$|Large <b>mobile</b> <b>irrigation</b> {{machines}} are self-propelled sprinkler irrigation systems which farmers are rapidly adopting {{due to the}} high precision of the irrigation application. Although it is highly desirable that control systems be used with such machines to both optimise the irrigation water volume applied to field crops and optimise water use efficiency, there are difficulties in applying classical control techniques. These are caused principally by the very slow speed of crop growth-response and stress-response dynamics; but in addition characteristics of the plant and infield sensors which are poorly known and provide only sparse, low-quality data for feedback control. This paper outlines the operation of large <b>mobile</b> <b>irrigation</b> machines, analyses the limitations {{in the application of}} classical control approaches for their optimal use, and describes the methods that have been used to implement whole-system control via alternative (adaptive) approaches. These involve accommodation of sparse and unreliable input data and the application and evaluation of a range of irrigation volumes on different sub-areas of the field as on-the-go local system identification...|$|R

At low wind speed (0. 44 m/s, 1. 4 ft/s), application rates decreased linearly from 50 mm/hr (2 in/hr) for positions closest to the <b>irrigation</b> <b>line</b> to zero at 4 m (12 ft) from the <b>irrigation</b> <b>line.</b> Application rates at positions farthest from the <b>irrigation</b> <b>line</b> were affected by wind speeds as low as 1 m/s (3. 3 ft/s).

Our results indicate strong variation of soil moisture as affected by season and irrigation.

This summer a drip irrigation system was installed along with fog capturing fences to supply water to native plants transplanted near the erosion control structures. As the project has grown, more irrigation {{has been added to}} increase the area available for transplanting. This irrigation system varies in elevation, slope, and diameter and lengths of <b>irrigation</b> <b>lines.</b> Because this project is experimentally monitored, it is important that all the transplants obtain the same amount of water. To check the efficiency of this system, the flow rates of 1. 9 L/hr rated pressure-compensating emitters along ¾” diameter polyethylene irrigation tubing were checked. Flow rates were relatively consistent at 1. 53 L/hr, 1. 60 L/hr and 1. 59 L/hr for 1 / 3, 2 / 3 and the whole system turned on, respectively. Although one might expect the addition of more <b>irrigation</b> <b>line</b> and emitters to decrease water pressure and thus the flow rate of individual emitters, the flow rates of emitters were found to be unaffected, indicating the effectiveness of the pressure-compensation. However, the flow rates of emitters were consistently lower than their 1. 9 L/hr rating. In conclusion, the irrigation system is currently providing equal water to each of the transplants, but at a rate lower than expected...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissipation}} of pendimethalin {{was investigated}} in soils of cotton fields in Thessaly, central Greece, {{for a period of}} two years. The fields were irrigated either with sprinkler or with sprinkler for the first two irrigations plus drip {{for the rest of the}} experimental period. Pendimethalin was applied at rates of 1. 1, 1. 32, and 0. 96 kg a. i. /ha in a clay loam soil at Rizomylos, a clay soil at Kypseli, and a sandy clay loam soil at Karditsa, respectively. Residues were determined with capillary GC-NPD after ethyl acetate extraction. Recovery of pendimethalin from spiked soils was 82 - 101 % with a repeatability of 2 - 7 %, and the limit of quantification was near 0. 04 mg/kg. At 150 days after application (DAA) pendimethalin residues found in the soils were 10 - 18 % of the initial measured concentrations. For the drip-irrigated fields, dissipation of pendimethalin varied within the field between the non-irrigated and the irrigated soil regions, indicating a more rapid loss in the irrigated part of the soil. Residues in the wet region (along the drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>line)</b> at 150 DAA were about 75 and 60 % of those measured in the dry region (off the <b>irrigation</b> <b>line)</b> of the soil at the Kypseli field for the 1996 and 1997 season, respectively.

Both trickle and level-basin irrigation methods, when properly managed and operated, achieved high cotton yields and water use efficiencies on a low water holding capacity soil in 1985. A maximum lint yield of 1906 kg/ha (3. 8 bales/ac) was achieved for the DPL- 90 variety with a single trickle <b>irrigation</b> <b>line</b> per every two rows irrigated daily on the narrow row spacing; however, the new DPL- 775 was best overall.

The narrow-row spacing (30 inch between rows) outyielded the conventional spacing (40 inch between rows) by 15 %, partly because of a higher plant populations.

These beds can be a flat bed which simply means {{the surface of the}} plastic mulch is level with the inter-row soil surface. Machines that form raised beds create a plastic surface higher than the inter-row soil surface.
