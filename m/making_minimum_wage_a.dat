40|$|Anti-sweatshop campaigns {{increased}} {{dramatically in the}} 1990 s. These campaigns took dif-ferent forms: direct pressure to change legislation in developing countries, pressure on firms, newspaper campaigns, and grassroots organizing. Activists targeted multinational firms in the textiles, footwear, and apparel sectors and helped spread consumer boycotts throughout college campuses. Yet there has been almost no academic research that analyzes precisely how these anti-sweatshop campaigns affected the workers {{they were designed to}} assist. This paper examines the impact of anti-sweatshop activism on labor market outcomes in Indonesia. Indonesia makes an ideal case study because it was the focus of campaigns introduced in the 1990 s to improve conditions for workers. The pressure took several forms. The United States threatened to withdraw special tariff privileges for Indonesian exports if Indonesia failed to address human rights issues. The Indonesian government responded by <b>making</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> increases <b>a</b> central component of its labor market policies in the 1990 s. 1 The nominal <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> qua-drupled and its real value more than doubled between 1989 and 1996. 2 Indonesia was also the target of consumer awareness campaigns waged against such companies as Nike, Adidas, and Reebok. As a result of activist pressure, these firms were induced to sign codes of conduct pledging to raise wages and improve working conditions in factories producing their products. We identify the impact of anti-sweatshop campaigns on wages through two approaches. First, we compare wage growth in textile, footwear, and apparel (TFA) plants relative to wage growth in the rest of manufacturing. We restrict the treatment group to foreign-owned or exporting TF...|$|R
50|$|In early April, the Clinton {{campaign}} had problems arising from Clinton's {{use of a}} story of health insurance coverage, an Ohio hospital, and a patient's death. Based upon a story Clinton had heard from a Meigs County sheriff's deputy in Pomeroy, Ohio in February, but had not had fact-checked, Clinton described a woman from rural Ohio who was <b>making</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> at <b>a</b> local pizza shop, was uninsured, and became pregnant. As told, there were complications with the pregnancy and the woman was denied treatment at a local hospital because she couldn't afford a $100 payment; she later {{was taken to the}} hospital by ambulance and lost the baby; she was then taken by helicopter to a Columbus hospital where she died of complications. Clinton used the story through April 4 in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Officials at O'Bleness Memorial Hospital in Athens, Ohio, said the woman did have insurance and had not been turned away; they expressed frustration that Clinton's campaign never called to verify the story, and asked that Clinton stop telling it. In fact, the woman had been earlier denied treatment at a private clinic because she owed them several thousand dollars from unpaid previous visits, and so thought she could not go to the clinic again once she became pregnant, even though she now had insurance. Thus she did not seek medical care until she was already in an emergency situation. On April 6, the Clinton campaign indicated it would drop use of the story. On April 11, Paul Krugman wrote a column in the New York Times saying the essential point about the poor state of health care in the United States was lost in the media storm about this episode and that Clinton's point about a pregnant woman who died after being turned away was essentially correct.|$|R

40|$|Often an {{increase}} in the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> is accompanied by a reduction in the capital tax. This paper analyzes the effects of interactions between the <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> and the capital tax in the general equilibrium framework. The analysis is conducted in an inter-temporal search model in which firms post <b>wages.</b> <b>A</b> (binding) <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> provides <b>a</b> lower support for the distribution of wages. The paper finds that the interaction of these two policy instruments significantly modify labor market outcomes and welfare cost. In the presence of <b>a</b> binding <b>minimum</b> <b>wage,</b> <b>a</b> decrease in the capital tax leads to <b>an</b> increase in <b>wage</b> dispersion. In contrast, when it is not binding, a lower capital tax may reduce the dispersion in <b>wages.</b> <b>A</b> binding <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> magnifies the positive effects of a lower capital tax on labor supply, employment, and output. It also enhances the welfare cost of capital tax.
