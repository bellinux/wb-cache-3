40|$|In this paper, author {{tries to}} analyze complex {{character}} {{of the relation between}} law and morality in contemporary law philosophy. There are three approaches to the issue of relation between law and morality: natural law theory (identity thesis), positivist (separation thesis) and Anglo-American analytical jurisprudence (polarity thesis). The identity thesis-law and <b>morality</b> <b>are</b> basically identical, although basic principles of <b>morality</b> <b>are</b> subordinated to the positive legal rules; the separation thesis-law and <b>morality</b> <b>are</b> quite different system of norms: positive legal rules are completely deprived of any moral content; Polarity thesis - law and <b>morality</b> <b>are</b> different systems of norms which complement to each other. The polarity thesis is exemplified in theories of Herbert Hart and Ronald Dworkin's. At the logical level, polarity thesis overcomes and specifically synthesizes abstract character and reductionism of identity and separation thesis. At the socio-historical level, the polarity thesis is result of historical development of legal and political institutions...|$|R

5|$|The {{argument}} from <b>morality</b> <b>is</b> {{an argument for}} the existence of God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} <b>morality</b> <b>is</b> noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that <b>morality</b> <b>is</b> the objective law of reason: just as objective physical laws necessitate physical actions (apples fall {{down because of}} gravity, for example), objective rational laws necessitate rational actions. He thus {{believed that}} a perfectly rational being must also be perfectly moral because a perfectly rational being subjectively finds it necessary {{to do what is}} rationally necessary. Because humans are not perfectly rational (they partly act by instinct), Kant believed that humans must conform their subjective will with objective rational laws, which he called conformity obligation. Kant argued that the objective law of reason is a priori, existing externally from rational being. Just as physical laws exist prior to physical beings, rational laws (morality) exist prior to rational beings. Therefore, according to Kant, rational <b>morality</b> <b>is</b> universal and cannot change depending on circumstance.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} philosophers, {{including}} Elizabeth Anscombe , Jean Bethke Elshtain , Servais Pinckaers, Iris Murdoch, and the Catholic Encyclopedia, have all {{suggested that the}} Kantian conception of ethics rooted in autonomy is contradictory in its dual contention that humans are co-legislators of morality and that <b>morality</b> <b>is</b> a priori. They argue that if something is universally a priori (i.e., existing unchangingly prior to experience), then it cannot also be in part dependent upon humans, who have not always existed. On the other hand, if humans truly do legislate morality, then they are not bound by it objectively, because they are always free to change it.|$|E
5|$|Related to the {{argument}} from <b>morality</b> <b>is</b> {{the argument}} from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth-century cardinal John Henry Newman. Newman proposed that the conscience, as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of the human experience of morality because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God must exist.|$|E

When leaving the confrontation with Baxter, he questions his use of his medical knowledge, {{even though it was}} in self-defense, and with genuine Hippocratic feeling. While shopping for his fish supper, he cites scientific research that shows greater consciousness in fish, and wonders whether he should stop eating them. As a sign of his rationalism, he appreciates the brutality of Saddam Hussein's rule as described by the Iraqi professor whom Perowne treated, at the same time taking seriously his children's concerns about the war.|$|E

5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} under Article 15(4) of the Constitution {{restrictions}} {{on the right of}} freedom of religion could be imposed only if public order, public health or <b>morality</b> <b>is</b> affected, and section 24(1)(a) of the SA provides for registered organizations to be dissolved only if they threaten public peace, welfare or good order. The appellants therefore submitted that {{there had to be a}} clear and immediate danger to public order before freedom of religion can be circumscribed. Since the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses posed no such threat, the deregistration order was unconstitutional and ultra vires the SA.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{level of}} moral reasoning {{is typical of}} adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of moral development. Conventional <b>morality</b> <b>is</b> characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E
5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard and affect the player's chosen morality. <b>Morality</b> <b>is</b> measured by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points allow the player to develop talents that affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game.|$|E

500|$|Many {{arguments}} from <b>morality</b> <b>are</b> based on moral normativity, {{which suggests that}} objective moral truths exist and require God's existence to give them authority. Often, they consider that <b>morality</b> seems to <b>be</b> binding – obligations are seen to convey {{more than just a}} preference, but imply that the obligation will stand, regardless of other factors or interests. For <b>morality</b> to <b>be</b> binding, God must exist. In its most general form, the argument from moral normativity is: ...|$|R
5|$|In Stage four (authority {{and social}} order {{obedience}} driven), {{it is important}} to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where <b>morality</b> <b>is</b> still predominantly dictated by an outside force.|$|E
5|$|Many {{critics have}} {{challenged}} the second premise of this argument, {{by offering a}} biological and sociological account {{of the development of}} human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of <b>morality</b> <b>is</b> a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.|$|E
5|$|<b>Morality</b> <b>is</b> {{measured}} by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points affect {{the availability of}} new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game. For example, the game features some missions to gain the loyalty of the squad. What the player does during one of these missions will determine whether they gain the loyalty of a squad member, which in turn will unlock a special power and also help in the final battle. Endings range from the entire team surviving to the entire team being killed, Shepard included, and everything in between. Upon completing the game, a New Game Plus option is unlocked, allowing players to replay the game using the same character with which they finished it.|$|E

5|$|Some {{arguments}} from moral order suggest that <b>morality</b> <b>is</b> based on rationality {{and that this}} can only be the case {{if there is a}} moral order in the universe. The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the universe, so God must exist. Alternative {{arguments from}} moral order have proposed that {{we have an obligation to}} attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists. A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God must exist.|$|E
5|$|Various {{forms of}} divine command theory have been {{presented}} by philosophers including William of Ockham, St Augustine, Duns Scotus, and John Calvin. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of God and that <b>morality</b> <b>is</b> determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's command is {{the only reason that}} a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason. The theory asserts that good actions are morally good {{as a result of their}} being commanded by God, and many religious believers subscribe to some form of divine command theory. Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what is morally right is what God desires.|$|E
5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human <b>morality</b> <b>is</b> developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E
