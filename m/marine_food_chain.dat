5|$|Shark populations began declining. Since {{they are}} predators {{near the top}} of the <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain,</b> an {{umbrella}} species, playing an important role in maintaining ocean ecosystems, this could have serious adverse environmental consequences for marine fisheries. Campaigns began in many nations to prohibit or greatly curtail finning in both territorial and international waters and work toward international agreements on the practice. In the U.S., President Bill Clinton signed the Shark Finning Prohibition Act (SFPA) into law in 2000 shortly before leaving office. It amended the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the primary statute regulating fisheries in the U.S.'s Exclusive Economic Zone up to 200 nautical miles offshore, to prohibit finning in U.S. territorial waters by any vessels, and the possession of fins by a U.S.-flagged vessel in international waters or the landing of any fins at a U.S. port without corresponding carcasses amounting to at least 20 times the weight of the fins. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) was charged with promulgating and implementing regulations to enforce the act.|$|E
25|$|In recent decades, {{overfishing}} {{has left}} many fisheries unproductive, disturbing <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain</b> dynamics and costing {{jobs in the}} fishing industry. Herring, cod and plaice fisheries may soon face the same plight as mackerel fishing, which ceased in the 1970s due to overfishing.|$|E
25|$|Serious {{environmental}} {{threats from}} plastic {{have been suggested}} {{in the light of}} the increasing presence of microplastics in the <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain</b> along with many highly toxic chemical pollutants that accumulate in plastics. They also accumulate in larger fragmented pieces of plastic called nurdles. In the 1960s the latter were observed in the guts of seabirds, and since then have been found in increasing concentration. In 2009, it was estimated that 10% of modern waste was plastics, although estimates vary according to region. Meanwhile, 50-80% of debris in marine areas is plastic.|$|E
30|$|Tributyltin {{is one of}} the {{important}} and wide-spread persistent organic contaminants that accumulate in the <b>food</b> <b>chain.</b> It is suspected to cause endocrine-disrupting effects in mammals, due in part to its possible transfer through <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chains</b> and to the consumption of contaminated seafood.|$|R
5|$|In bays {{where they}} occur in very high numbers, {{predation}} by ctenophores may control {{the populations of}} small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton (planktonic plants), which are {{a vital part of}} <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chains.</b>|$|R
50|$|The various {{sorts of}} algae play {{significant}} roles in aquatic ecology. Microscopic forms that live {{suspended in the}} water column (phytoplankton) provide the food base for most <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chains.</b> In very high densities (algal blooms), these algae may discolor the water and outcompete, poison, or asphyxiate other life forms.|$|R
25|$|Steller {{sea lions}} are skilled and {{opportunistic}} marine predators, feeding {{on a wide}} range of fish and cephalopod species. Important diet components include walleye pollock, Atka mackerel, halibut, herring, capelin, flatfish Pacific cod, rockfish, sculpins, and cephalopods. They seem to prefer schooling fish and remain primarily between intertidal zones and continental shelves. They are also known to enter estuarine environments and feed on some brackishwater fish such as sturgeon. Very occasionally, they have been known to prey on northern fur seals, harbor seals, and sea otter pups. They are near the top of the <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain,</b> but are susceptible to predation by killer whales and great white sharks.|$|E
500|$|The IUCN {{lists the}} California sea lion as Least Concern due to [...] "its large and {{increasing}} population size." [...] The estimated population is 238,000–241,000 for the U.S. or Pacific Temperate stock, 75,000–85,000 for the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and 31,393 {{for the population}} in the Gulf of California. Off the Pacific coast of the United States, sea lions are so numerous that they are close to carrying capacity, while the Gulf of California population declined by 20% by 2008. Sea lions may be killed when in conflict with fishermen, by poaching, and by entanglements in man-made garbage. They are also threatened by pollutants like DDT and PCB which accumulate in the <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Another {{issue is}} that {{removing}} marine debris from our oceans can potentially cause more harm than good. Cleaning up micro-plastics could also accidentally take out plankton, which are the main lower level food group for the <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain</b> and {{over half of the}} photosynthesis on earth.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} trace element bioavailability and potential transfer into <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chains</b> in human impacted {{areas of the}} Fildes Peninsula (King George Island, South Shetland Islands Archipelago), element levels (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) were determined in water, sediments, phytoplankton, and in diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin (Bacillariophyceae) cells immobilised in alginate and exposed to water and sediments, from the Bellingshausen Dome (reference site) and Ardley Cove (human impacted area), during January 2014. High element concentrations in exposed P. tricornutum indicated element mobilisation from sediments into the water. Levels in exposed cells reflected the sediment element content pattern, comparable {{to those found in}} phytoplankton, supporting phytoplankton as an important path of trace element entry into <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chains.</b> This study clearly shows immobilised P. tricornutum as good proxy of phytoplankton concerning element accumulation efficiency, and an effective tool to monitor trace element contamination in polar coastal ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{recognition of the}} quantitative importance of metal accumulation from dietary pathways in different <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> webs. With a simple kinetic model requiring measurements of metal assimilation efficiency (AE), metal efflux rate and ingestion activity of the relevant animals, {{it is possible to}} predict the transfer (and potential biomagnification) of metals along diverse <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chains.</b> In this paper, <b>food</b> <b>chain</b> transfer in different <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chains</b> (planktonic and benthic) is reviewed, and any potential biomagnification of metals is predicted using the simple kinetic equation. It is well recognized that metal concentrations in animals are probably not related to the trophic level in the <b>food</b> <b>chain,</b> but some metals (Hg and Zn) may potentially be influenced by the numbers of trophic interactions involved. Depending on these different trophic interactions, the potential biomagnification of metals is influenced by metal assimilation or metal efflux rate or both. Metals may potentially be biomagnified in benthic food chains; principally, in those with gastropods as top predators, as they can efficiently sequester dietary metals. The biodiminution of metals (concentration decreases at a higher trophic level) in the classical <b>marine</b> planktonic <b>food</b> <b>chain</b> (phytoplankton to copepods to fish) is largely the result of the effective efflux of metals by the copepods and the very low assimilation of metals by marine fish. Although many past studies have considered the physico-chemical properties of metals in prey in controlling <b>food</b> <b>chain</b> transfer, it is suggested that the physiological and biochemical processes in the herbivore or predator should be emphasized in future studies. Also, the complicated metal-handling strategies found in different marine organisms clearly need to be appreciated...|$|R
2500|$|Because Prince William Sound {{contained}} many rocky coves {{where the}} oil collected, {{the decision was}} made to displace it with high-pressure hot water. However, this also displaced and destroyed the microbial populations on the shoreline; many of these organisms (e.g. plankton) are the basis of the coastal <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chain,</b> and others (e.g. certain bacteria and fungi) are capable of facilitating the biodegradation of oil. [...] At the time, both scientific advice and public pressure was to clean everything, but since then, a much greater understanding of natural and facilitated remediation processes has developed, due somewhat in part to the opportunity presented for study by the Exxon Valdez spill. Despite the extensive cleanup attempts, less than ten percent of the oil was recovered and a study conducted by NOAA determined that as of early 2007 more than [...] of oil remain in the sandy soil of the contaminated shoreline, declining at a rate of less than 4% per year.|$|E

40|$|Subcellular metal {{distribution}} {{may play}} an important role in the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of metals in <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chains.</b> In the present study, we preexposed the green mussel Perna viridis to Ag and Cd and quantified their trophic transfer efficiencies to two predators (whelks [Thais clavigera] and fish [Terapon jarbua]). For the mussels, more Ag was distributed in the metal-rich granule (MRG) fraction following Ag exposure, and more Cd was distributed in the metallothionein-like protein following Cd exposure. In addition, Cd was mainly bound with the proteins having a molecular size of approximately 20 kDa. After being fed with metal-exposed mussels, the assimilation efficiencies of Ag decreased significantly (from 77 to 29 - 60 % in whelks and from 9 to 2 % in fish) with an increasing percentage of Ag deposited in the MRG fraction of the prey. In contrast, the assimilation efficiencies of Cd remained comparable (81 - 85 % in whelks and 6 - 8 % in fish), because its partitioning in the soluble fraction of different treatments of the prey was similar. The efflux of Ag and Cd in the two predators was comparable after feeding on preexposed mussel prey. Our results imply that the subcellular distribution of metals in prey may affect the dietary assimilation of metals in predators, but such influence is clearly metal-specific. The present study may lead to a better understanding of metal trophic transfer in different <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chains...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{a review}} article, J. David Archibald and David E. Fastovsky {{discussed}} a scenario combining three major postulated causes: volcanism, marine regression, and extraterrestrial impact. In this scenario, terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by the changes in, and loss of, habitats. Dinosaurs, {{as the largest}} vertebrates, were the first affected by environmental changes, and their diversity declined. At the same time, particulate materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of the globe. Then, an impact event occurred, causing collapses in photosynthesis-based <b>food</b> <b>chains,</b> both in the already-stressed terrestrial <b>food</b> <b>chains</b> and in the <b>marine</b> <b>food</b> <b>chains.</b> The major difference between this hypothesis and the single-cause hypotheses is that its proponents view the suggested single causes as, either not sufficient in strength to cause the extinctions or, not likely to produce the taxonomic pattern of the extinction. Recent work at Seymour Island, Antarctica showed two separate extinction events near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, with one correlating to Deccan Trap volcanism and one correlated with the Chicxulub impact.|$|R
