5|$|In May 1958, Britain had {{informed}} that US {{that it would}} be willing to join a testing <b>moratorium</b> on 31 October 1958, by which point it would have finished its hydrogen-bomb testing, conditional on the US providing Britain with nuclear information following amendment of the McMahon Act. The US Congress approved amendments permitting greater collaboration in late June. Following Soviet assent on 30 August 1958 to the one-year <b>moratorium,</b> the three countries conducted a series of tests in September and October. At least 54 tests were conducted by the US and 14 by the Soviet Union in this period. On 31 October 1958 the three countries initiated test-ban negotiations (the Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Tests) and agreed to a temporary <b>moratorium</b> (the Soviet Union joined the <b>moratorium</b> shortly after this date). The <b>moratorium</b> would last for close to three years.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} whales are still subject to direct hunting, despite the 1986 <b>moratorium</b> ban on whaling set {{under the terms}} of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). There are only two nations {{remaining}} which sanction commercial whaling: Norway, where several hundred common minke whales are harvested each year; and Iceland, where quotas of 150 fin whales and 100 minke whales per year are set. Japan also harvests several hundred Antarctic and North Pacific minke whales each year, ostensibly for scientific research in accordance with the <b>moratorium.</b> However, the illegal trade of whale and dolphin meat is a significant market in Japan and some countries.|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} post-conflict history {{education}} moratoria: the temporary suspension of history education or its recent history segment, including its textbooks, {{with the aim}} of aligning it to the goals of a transition to peace and democracy. I present fifteen cases arranged under four types: <b>moratoria</b> after the defeat of the Axis powers in international war (the successor states of Nazi Germany, Anschluss Austria, Fascist Italy, and Imperialist Japan), <b>moratoria</b> after the implosion of communist regimes (USSR, Moldova, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina), <b>moratoria</b> after genocides (Cambodia, Rwanda, and Guatemala), and <b>moratoria</b> after racial, ethnic and religious conflicts (South Africa, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Iraq). The analytical part starts with the basic question of whether the period of recent violence should be taught at all: I argue that this is a state duty, any suspension of which cannot but be temporary. After a brief exploration of the distribution over time of the <b>moratoria,</b> I discuss the <b>moratoria</b> brokers (the executive and legislative branches of government) as well as the pressures from below (civil society) and above (international intervention). Seven types of reasons typically used to justify <b>moratoria</b> are then weighed: politics, didactics, legacy, practice, safety, reconciliation and the passage of time. Next, the crucial question is tackled of how long <b>moratoria</b> lasted and how long they ought to last: I argue that wholesale <b>moratoria</b> should last no longer than five years and that meanwhile sound interim materials should be prepared. By way of conclusion, the relationship between <b>moratoria,</b> forgetting and democracy is explored. Truly democratic <b>moratoria</b> are part of mediation-induced, not censorship-induced strategies of social forgetting. Five conditions decide this: a legal framework, an explicit and short time span, a public debate, the effective preparation of new materials, and unimpeded academic historical research. They help define under which regime of restrictions post-conflict history education <b>moratoria</b> are justified in a democratic society...|$|R
40|$|Many U. S. states imposed {{temporary}} <b>moratoria</b> on {{farm and}} nonfarm residential mortgage fore-closures during the Great Depression. This {{article describes the}} conditions that led some states to impose these <b>moratoria</b> and other mortgage relief during the Depression and discusses the economic effects. <b>Moratoria</b> were more common in states with large farm populations (as a percentage of total state population) and high farm mortgage foreclosure rates, although nonfarm mortgage distress appears to help explain why a few states with relatively low farm foreclosure rates also imposed <b>moratoria.</b> The <b>moratoria</b> reduced farm foreclosure rates in the short run, but they also appear to have reduced the supply of loans and made credit more expensive for subsequent borrowers. The evidence from the Great Depression demonstrates how government actions to reduce foreclosures can impose costs that should be weighed against potential benefits.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{presence of}} bright, new condominium development in America’s cities {{is changing the}} composition and appearance of these urban landscapes. Long-time local residents in gentrifying areas are confronted daily with the impacts of development, and are searching for tools to preserve their communities and keep them affordable. One response has been proposed <b>moratoria</b> on condominium construction. This approach aims to stop the influx of more affluent individuals into urban neighborhoods by preventing the construction of higher-end condominiums. This Note examines the validity of such <b>moratoria</b> on condominium construction as an exercise of the police power. Through a comparison to rent control ordinances and condominium conversion <b>moratoria,</b> it argues that valid condominium construction <b>moratoria</b> can be implemented to address social and economic concerns. The Note concludes, however, that valid construction <b>moratoria</b> are not always the most appropriate or effective growth management tool to address a gentrifying community’s needs...|$|R

5|$|Croatia held an {{independence}} {{referendum on}} 19 May 1991, following the Croatian parliamentary elections of 1990 {{and the rise}} of ethnic tensions that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia. With 83 percent turnout, voters approved the referendum, with 93 percent in favor of independence. Subsequently, Croatia declared independence and the dissolution of its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991, but it introduced a three-month <b>moratorium</b> on the decision when urged to do so by the European Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe through the Brioni Agreement. The war in Croatia escalated during the <b>moratorium,</b> and on 8 October 1991, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. In 1992, the countries of the European Economic Community granted Croatia diplomatic recognition and Croatia was admitted to the United Nations.|$|E

5|$|Electricity {{generated}} in Switzerland is 56% from hydroelectricity and 39% from nuclear power, {{resulting in a}} nearly CO2-free electricity-generating network. On 18 May 2003, two anti-nuclear initiatives were turned down: <b>Moratorium</b> Plus, aimed at forbidding the building of new nuclear power plants (41.6% supported and 58.4% opposed), and Electricity Without Nuclear (33.7% supported and 66.3% opposed) after a previous <b>moratorium</b> expired in 2000. However, {{as a reaction to}} the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the Swiss government announced in 2011 that it plans to end its use of nuclear energy in the next 2 or 3 decades. In November 2016, Swiss voters rejected a proposal by the Green Party to accelerate the phaseout of nuclear power (45.8% supported and 54.2% opposed).

5|$|On 22 August 1958, Eisenhower {{announced}} a <b>moratorium</b> on nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958. This {{did not mean}} an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline, which the Soviets did not meet, conducting tests on 1 and 3 November. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies {{such as the use}} of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride were successfully tested in the Pendant and Burgee tests, allowing a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices.

40|$|In 2007, the Australian {{states of}} Victoria and New South Wales held reviews of their <b>moratoriums</b> on the {{commercial}} release {{of genetically modified}} (GM) food crops.

This proposition is informed by: their formation within a policy context of pro-GM development, which saw 'stacked' pro-GM review panels, narrow terms of reference, and outcomes favouring a narrow coalition of agbiotechnology interests; the critical literature on public inquiries; and other evidences that suggest the underlying purpose of the public inquiries was to reach the inescapable conclusion that the <b>moratoriums</b> should be changed.
