40|$|Uncertainty {{about the}} cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> has led to {{research}} being conducted to understand the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> within the Australian construction industry. This has involved reviewing work done in Australia and overseas as well as exploring the efforts within the construction industry to collect cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> information. While there is currently awareness of the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> and that efforts {{should be taken to}} minimise this cost, there is little precise understanding of it in terms of value or how it happens. This paper explores the barriers to understanding the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering.</b> Throughout the worldwide construction industry tendering is acknowledged to be complicated, adding considerable cost to construction. Efforts to understand the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> are confounded by issues that are both visible and invisible to formal accounting of the construction process. This paper intends to demonstrate the problems and their causes. Anecdotes are derived from the literature, observations of construction purchases, and interview data to demonstrate the barriers to understanding the cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering.</b> This is augmented by corresponding observations of other major purchases. Problems and causes are described in terms of these anecdotes. Because of the diverse activities undertaken by constructors and limitations of accounting categories, expenses associated with tendering are difficult to capture and quantify. These problems are explained through examples. Even in those cases where there are genuine intentions to capture costs <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> there is a failure to do so. It appears that implementation difficulties are so insurmountable that either people do not bother or management redirects effort from collecting cost <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> data. It is also shown that the expense <b>of</b> <b>tendering</b> and uncertainty <b>of</b> outcomes leads tenderers to engage in concealed behaviour to reduce the uncertainty and cost associated with tendering. That is, collusion. For this reason especially, it is concluded that tendering and associated costs need to be understood in greater detail...|$|R

The next step was to conduct a questionnaire survey to ascertain the extent to which ethical behaviour in tendering is supported and practised in Australia. This showed that most companies support the use codes <b>of</b> <b>tendering,</b> defend the right <b>of</b> withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>tenders,</b> disapprove <b>of</b> bid shopping, cover pricing and union involvement in the tendering process, support the principals' right to know what is included in a tender and the self-regulation <b>of</b> the <b>tendering</b> codes. In addition, most companies have developed, and follow, idiosyncratic ethical guidelines that are independent of, and often contrary to, the nationally prescribed codes. The major conclusion is that a more empirical approach to the development of future ethical prescriptions in the field is needed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tendering</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the stages}} in {{construction}} procurement that requires extensive information and documents exchange. However, tender documents {{are not always}} clear in practice. The {{aim of this study}} was to ascertain the clarity and adequacy <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> documents used in practice. Access was negotiated into two UK construction firms and the whole tender process for two projects was shadowed for 6 - 7 weeks in each firm using an ethnographic approach. A significant amount <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> queries, amendments and addenda were recorded. This showed that quality <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> documentation is still a problem in construction despite the existence of standards like Co-ordinated Project Information (1987) and British Standard 1192 (1984 and 1990) that are meant to help in producing clear and consistent project information. Poor quality tender documents are a source of inaccurate estimates, claims and disputes on contracts. Six recommendations are presented to help in improving the quality <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> documentation. Further research is needed into the recommendations to help improve the quality <b>of</b> <b>tender</b> documents, perhaps in conjunction with an industry-wide investigation into the level of incorporation of CPI principles in practice...|$|R
