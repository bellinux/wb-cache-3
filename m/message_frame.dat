However, <b>message</b> <b>frames</b> about environmental regulations are often misleading, potentially reinforcing misinformation and misperceptions among the voting public. This may translate into a net shift {{in the level of}} public support for or opposition against environmental policies and regulations. With this paper, I attempt to answer the following policy question: how does <b>message</b> <b>framing</b> affect public opinion about environmental regulations? I first analyze a sample of polling data from the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research’s iPOLL Databank to: 1) identify the most commonly used environmental <b>message</b> <b>frames</b> over the past decade (2004 - 2014), and 2) determine how these frames affect survey results.

I find that <b>message</b> <b>frames</b> emphasizing environmental regulations’ benefits to public health and economic growth generate more pro-environmental responses than frames that simply stress the need for environmental protection. Environmental groups who engage in future policymaking and advocacy efforts can use these findings to inform more effective <b>message</b> <b>framing</b> strategies that may prompt the public to express greater support for environmental regulations and environmental issues in general...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} thesis is to test {{two types of}} persuasive message {{strategies}} including narrative message type and <b>message</b> <b>frame</b> in health context and to investigate the potential interplay of those strategies when health message contain multiple persuasive strategies that combine various categories (e. g., gain-framed narrative message or loss-framed statistical evidence). In fact, the combination of strategies seems likely to intensify or diminish the effect of health message on persuasion. The results are congruent with the transportation theory. Narrative message produces higher transportation experience into the message than statistical evidence, and higher transportation yields positive attitude and intention toward skin cancer detection behaviors than low transportation. Moreover, the results also indicate that loss frame elicits no effect on attitude and intention toward skin cancer detection behaviors compared to gain frame. The findings support the meta-analyses of <b>message</b> <b>frame</b> literature, arguing that loss frame is only effective in promoting breast cancer detection behavior but not for other detection behaviors such as HIV test and blood test.

40|$|Existing {{literature}} on consumer behavior {{has argued that}} an individual’s regulatory orientation interacts with <b>message</b> <b>framing.</b> If there is a match between regulatory orientation (promotion versus prevention) and <b>message</b> <b>framing,</b> this results in positive attitudes toward a given advertisement. Conversely, {{if there is a}} mismatch, the effect is opposite, i. e., attitudes toward that advertisement are less positive and less favorable. This research extends the term of compatibility by examining how regulatory focus moderates the impact of two aspects of <b>message</b> <b>framing</b> (attribute framing and risky choice framing) on customer perceptions. It also examines whether regulatory fit is created when there are interactions between individuals’ regulatory orientation and <b>message</b> <b>framing</b> and how the fit changes customer perceptions about a message. Specifically, this dissertation provides answers to the following questions: (1) does regulatory fit take place when regulatory focus is compatible with two aspects of <b>message</b> <b>framing</b> (attribute and risky choice) ?; (2) does regulatory fit take place when one aspect of <b>message</b> <b>framing</b> (attribute) is compatible with the other (risky choice) ?; and (3) how do customer perceptions change if customers experience regulatory fit? The results show that the effects of utilitarian attributes and national brands are dominating and that both promotion- and prevention-oriented customers have higher perceptions of these attributes and brands. The findings of this study have both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, this study should enhance our understanding of regulatory focus theory.

The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the role of the emotions of fear and hope in mediating the influence of emotion-framed PSAs. This study explored the relative effectiveness of a fear-framed video message and a hope-framed video message at influencing people’s attitudes toward genetic cancer screening and in persuading individuals at increased risk for cancer to talk to their doctors about genetic cancer screening. This study examined three different models of mediation: a model testing the mediation of framing effect on behavioral intent by attitude, a model testing the mediation of framing effect on attitude by both fear and hope, and a model testing the mediation of framing effect on behavioral intent by fear and hope. Overall, the fear-framed and hope-framed PSAs did not differ from a control group in terms of attitude toward genetic cancer screening, but both PSAs lead to greater intent to discuss genetic cancer screening with a health care provider (compared to the control group). <b>Message</b> <b>frame</b> had no significant indirect effect on behavioral intent through attitude toward genetic cancer screening.

40|$|Abstract.

The beginning position of each <b>message</b> <b>frame</b> can be estimated accurately, and the beginning messages are constant or can be estimated, thus the coherent integration time can exceed one navigation bit, which can improve the Doppler frequency estimated accuracy. At the fixed position of the frame, the tracking channel only tracks the pseudo-code phase, and does not track the carrier frequency and phase. This algorithm can keep stable tracking for weak signals with 28 dBHz carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N 0), while using only 2 % of the power required by the computation associated with the traditional tracking...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Two {{new medium}} access {{protocols}} for ring type local area networks, CTR (Concurrent Token Ring) protocol and DRUID (Destination Removal withoUt Intermediate node Delay) ring protocol, are proposed, designed and analyzed. A destination partial removal technique is designed {{and used in}} these two protocols to support concurrent message transmission and minimize loop latency. CTR protocol is the first protocol using the destination partial removal technique. In this network, a source node captures a Token and transmits a message which loops around the ring to its destination. The <b>message</b> <b>frame</b> is truncated and configured by the destination node into a Conditional Token which is allowed to circulate back to the source node for final destruction. The Conditional Token, informs "downstream" nodes of busy data paths and allows them to establish concurrent message transmission if the resources they need are free. In a DRUID ring network, a node may initiate message transmission if its output link is free. Every node will relay each incoming message immediately if it is idle when the message arrives. At the same time, the node also receives and buffers all the incoming messages. Upon decoding the destination address, the destination node will truncate the <b>message</b> <b>frame</b> to form a cut frame by eliminating the information field from its output data stream. This cut frame will continue to circulate around the ring until it arrives at a busy node where it is buffered, identified and destroyed. The <b>message</b> <b>frame</b> will be completely removed by the destination node if it is busy when the message arrives. The protocol supports high concurrency while the loop latency is minimized. Programs {{have been developed to}} simulate these two protocols. Their results are compared with Token Ring protocol and Register Insertion Ring protocol.

Participants then answered a level of behavioral expectancy (i. e., how likely or unlikely they are to engage in this behavior) and an explanation of cognitive evaluation in the form of a qualitative question (why the provided message was persuasive or not).
