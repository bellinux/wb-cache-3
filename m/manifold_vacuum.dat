Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E

The E-stick was also available in conjunction with an overdrive unit.

50|$|Early wipers {{were often}} {{driven by a}} vacuum motor powered by <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum.</b> This had the {{drawback}} that <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> varies depending on throttle position, and is almost non-existent under wide-open throttle, when the wipers would slow down or even stop.

5000|$|The PCV valve is a {{variable}} orifice {{that controls the}} flow of crankcase fumes, admixed with fresh air admitted to the crankcase by the breather, into the intake tract. With no <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> a restrictor—generally a cone or ball—is held by a light spring in a position exposing the full size of the valve's orifice to the intake manifold. With the engine running, the restrictor is drawn towards the orifice by <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> restricting the opening proportionate {{to the level of}} engine vacuum vs. spring tension. At idle, <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> is high, but a large amount of extra air would amount to a vacuum leak, causing the engine to run too lean and/or too fast. So at high <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> the PCV valve allows only a low flow rate. This is in accordance with the low volume of crankcase fumes generated at low engine speeds. At higher engine speeds, with less <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> the PCV valve permits a greater flow rate {{to keep up with the}} greater volume of crankcase fumes; because of the higher engine speed, a greater amount of [...] "extra" [...] air via the PCV system can be tolerated without upsetting the engine's running. At full throttle, very little <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> is present, so there is little flow through the PCV valve. However, this is the condition under which the maximum volume of crankcase gas is present. Most of it escapes under its own pressure via the crankcase breather, flowing into the engine's intake tract via the air cleaner.|$|E

50|$|Vacuum {{is often}} used to drive {{auxiliary}} systems on the vehicle. Vacuum-assist brake servos, for example, use atmospheric pressure pressing against the engine <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> to increase pressure on the brakes.

50|$|Suppose {{the vacuum}} is the <b>vacuum</b> <b>manifold</b> Σ. Then, for finite energies, {{as we move}} along each {{direction}} towards spatial infinity, the state along the path approaches a point on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>manifold</b> Σ.

He considered an N=1 theory in 4-dimensions with global supersymmetry. N=1 means that the fermionic components of the supersymmetry algebra can be assembled into a single Majorana supercharge. The only scalars in such a theory are the complex scalars of the chiral superfields. He found that the <b>vacuum</b> <b>manifold</b> of allowed <b>vacuum</b> expectation values for these scalars is not only complex but also a Kähler manifold.|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} quasi-Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes, which play {{prominent}} roles in high energy physics {{but have been}} elusive experimentally, can be realized with atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. The quasi-NG modes emerge when the symmetry of a ground state is larger {{than that of the}} Hamiltonian. When they appear, the conventional <b>vacuum</b> <b>manifold</b> should be enlarged. Consequently topological defects that are stable within the conventional <b>vacuum</b> <b>manifold</b> become unstable and decay by emitting the quasi-NG modes. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, we show that the topological defects are stabilized by quantum fluctuations that make the quasi-NG modes massive, thereby suppressing their emission.
