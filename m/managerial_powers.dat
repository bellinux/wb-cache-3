40|$|This article {{analyzes}} whether managerial judging reforms {{introduced to}} expedite procedure at the International Criminal Tribunal {{for the former}} Yugoslavia (ICTY) achieved their goal. Using survival analysis, the paper tests {{the hypothesis that the}} higher the number of reforms a case was subjected to, the shorter the pretrial and trial phase of that case should be. Our six models for pretrial and trial reveal that in all pretrial and trial models the number of reforms is significantly correlated with longer pretrial and trial. The article explains that reforms made process longer rather than shorter because ICTY judges did not use their <b>managerial</b> <b>powers</b> or used them deficiently, and prosecution and defense managed to neutralize the implementation of the reforms. To explain judges’ behavior, the paper articulates an unnoticed challenge for managerial judging—the court is likely to have limited information about the case that may lead judges to restrict use of their <b>managerial</b> <b>powers</b> to avoid making inefficient or unfair decisions. In addition, ICTY did not have an implementation plan to encourage judges to change their behavior. The paper also explains the incentives that prosecution and defense had to neutralize the reforms...|$|E

Our findings are largely consistent with predictions from the optimal contracting literature. The size of the plan is negatively related to Tobin’s Q and firm size and is positively related to proxies for monitoring costs, which also influence the probability of launching premium ESOPs. However, our results also show that the premium (out-of-the-moneyness) is negatively related to prior stock returns and cash flow to assets, which may indicate higher <b>managerial</b> <b>powers,</b> leading to more in-the-money options, in well-performing firms. Finally, we also report a positive relationship between the premium and the length of the vesting period, indicating an effort to keep the incentives for management from falling over time...|$|E

The study is about every day police patrol work, both emergency patrol and community beat policing. We have systematically observed what police officers {{do when they}} are out on patrol, and explored how contextual factors can explain ‘why’ police officers do what they do.

These lead us {{to the conclusion that}} in Norway community beat policing is not successfully implemented. The study points to the need for professional leadership in preference to management oriented to resource allocation. The study indicates that if the police want to move from an old fashioned reactive style of policing towards community policing or problem oriented policing, they have {{to do more than just}} ask emergency patrol officers to also fulfil the role of community beat officer. However, it is not enough to appoint some officers as community beat officers.

A comparison between the recommendations of the Main Report and the proposals of the Scottish Joint Negotiating Committee for Teaching Staff in School Education accepted by the EIS indicates some success on the part of teachers. A number of anomalies in the Main Report over salaries were eliminated, (eg. ensuring a 10 % safety net, introducing a common scale and maximum salary structure and increased rewards for teachers {{at the top of the}} salary scale), and at least a deferment of the moves towards increased <b>managerial</b> <b>powers</b> for teachers.

40|$|By using general {{estimation}} equations (GEE) on {{a sample}} of the biggest firms on Oslo Stock Exchange, the <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> hypothesis is tested in a Norwegian context. The sample spans over 5 years and consist of 112 complete observations. One of the measures of <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> is using social network theory where the extent of the CEO's social network is represented by measures of the degree of connections through board positions. These measures are called centrality measures. The focus of the thesis is to evaluate whether there is a significant positive relationship between centrality and executive compensation, and whether there is a significant relationship between <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> and executive compensation. Only one of the centrality measures is found to be significantly, but the variable is negatively correlated with pay, and there is a concern that the variable capture a different effect than it was supposed to. Hence, there is not enough evidence to support that there is a positive relationship between connectedness and executive pay. Furthermore, some of proxies for <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> were found to be significant, while others were not. Hence, the conclusion is that the influence of <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> may be important and should be taken into account when explaining executive pay and designing compensation packages. However, the theory should be used as a supplement to existing models like agency theory, as the <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> hypothesis can t fully explain all aspects of executive compensation.

It is first described the “internal” fragmentation of the enterprise through subcontracting and outsourcing, a process that has given a new importance to the issue of how to identify the employer; it is then examined the “external” fragmentation of the enterprise, due to the enlargement of the market to a transnational dimension, that has increasingly given the employer the power to choose the law which will rule the employment relation. The essay describes also how labour law has tackled the breaking down of employer’s contractual liability and the new immunities granted to employers in the exercise of his or her <b>managerial</b> <b>powers</b> and prerogatives as a consequence. The new legal protection techniques are of a relational kind, i. e. they govern relations where rights and duties of the parties are not entirely defined a priori and they do so by adopting functional criteria of allocation of employer’ liability among different economic entities and by striking the balance between different interests through the application of the general clauses and of the principles of equality and reasonableness.

40|$|This article, {{part of a}} {{symposium}} marking the fortieth anniversary of the United States District Court for the Central District of California, first surveys the (very considerable) extent to which changes in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure over {{the past quarter century}} have expanded and legitimized the pretrial <b>managerial</b> <b>powers</b> of federal trial-court judges. It then turns to an issue sometimes touched on in prior literature [...] whether the move toward greater managerialism departs from the “adversarial” model of the judge as passive referee and makes us more like supposedly “inquisitorial” civil-law systems. To the extent that civil-law judges generally exercise considerable initiative and control in shaping the course of civil proceedings (which they appear to do in some civil-law systems but less so or very little in others), greater managerialism in America does seem to bring about a significant degree of convergence. And greater promotion of settlement and alternative dispute resolution by American managerial judges also appears to bring us closer to practice in at least some prominent civil-law systems. But a defining feature of systems that truly deserve the label “inquisitorial” is judicial primacy in fact-gathering, found in some [...] but again, not all [...] civil-law systems. On this measure American managerialism largely does not put the judge in that role, so that statements appearing to see our managerialism as converging with “inquisitorial” systems are correct {{only to the extent that}} our practices may be becoming somewhat more like the non-inquisitorial aspects of civil-law judging. Nor should the label “inquisitorial” obscure the very considerable extent of party control that exists in civil-law as well as “adversarial” common-law systems. And, of course, much American pretrial managerialism is about discovery, of which civil-law systems (and other common-law ones as well) have considerably less than we do. The convergence effected by greater American pretrial managerialism thus is significant, but in limited respects, and needs to be addressed with precision. In particular, comparisons should avoid implying that we are yet in any major way moving toward the model of judge as truly “inquisitorial” investigator with lead responsibility for ferreting out the facts relevant to the parties’ dispute...|$|E
40|$|Most {{democratic}} societies {{expect their}} schools {{to play an}} important role in helping citizens to develop a set of attitudes, values, beliefs and knowledge that are conducive to the maintenance of democratic institutions. There is no important task for a nation other than developing an informed and responsible democratic citizenry through education. Therefore, it is imperative that educators, policymakers, and members of civil society should concern themselves with streamlining democratic issues in the educational programs in the primary schools for the advancement of democratic institutions and governance. Internal demands for democracy and the rule of law combined with the externally driven democratization and good governance projects has left some African states to experience a transition from one-party system of governance, military rule or civilian dictatorships to various forms of political pluralism systems of government. Yet schools, the very institutions expected to prepare students for democracy have not been given adequate attention for playing a central role in the mission of preparing young citizens for democracy. The purpose of this study is to determine how primary schools in South Sudan promote practices of democracy. In that regard, this study sought to answer the following research questions: 1) What are the education policies of the Government of South Sudan on the promotion of democracy in primary schools? 2) What are the pupils and teachers perception of democracy? 3) How do primary school organizational structures contribute to the practices of democracy? The empirical part of the thesis was based on a fieldwork study of three primary schools in South Sudan. A qualitative research approach was used and in all twenty participants consisting of pupils, teachers, head teachers and government officials were interviewed. Observation of activities in the schools was also done together with a study of documents as source of information. The following theoretical concepts informed the conduct and execution of this research study: democracy, citizen participation and socialization. The following major findings featured out in this study: There are policies for fostering democratic values and behaviours in primary schools of South Sudan. These policies include, inter alia, a South Sudan education policy for inculcating democratic values and practices in learners by encouraging participatory learning, development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The study has also revealed a South Sudan education policy for the involvement of local community through SMC (School Management Committee) and PTA (Parents and Teachers Associations) as the school governing bodies with <b>managerial</b> <b>powers</b> over financial management; disciplinary management; co-curricula activities management; teacher and learner welfare management. Other roles include overseeing mobilization of resources by the community. There is also a South Sudan government education policy that requires prefect systems to be formed in a democratic manner at every public primary school as pupils’ representative for establishing formal channels of communication between learners and the school administration. The findings further indicate that both pupils and teachers’ perception of democracy is that they view democracy as a way of governing society. In general, their understanding of democracy is that democracy is a method. It is has to do with participation in voting or election and institutions of the school such as the prefects, the school management committees and the parents and teachers association. Moreover, their concept of democracy includes knowledge on the government, democratic systems, legislative power, and the structure of parliament. In that regard and in my own point of view, their concept of democracy is that it is not a way of life or process but rather it is a way of governing.

By questioning the underlying assumptions of the optimal contracting approach, we propose our <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> hypothesis and peer benchmarking hypotheses in the particular UK context, leading to the first level and the second level integrated compensation models to be set in our study. Drawing on the <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> approach, we combine <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> with the traditional optimal contracting model to test the impact of <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> {{on the level of}} executive pay. For this purpose, we construct a set of <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> indexes combining corporate governance attributes via PCA technique to measure the degree of influence that top executives can exert over the board in the pay negotiation process in the UK context. We find that after controlling for firm characteristics, the level of executive pay is not significantly related to the degree of <b>managerial</b> <b>power.</b> Grounded on prospect theory, we further investigate the widespread use of peer benchmarking in pay setting process from a behavioural perspective by incorporating the behavioural elements in terms of the cognitive biases of framing and loss aversion into our first level integrated compensation model. We find that after controlling for <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> and firm characteristics, the change in pay is positively related to the pay anomaly adjusting towards peer pay benchmarks, and underpaid CEOs and executives receive higher pay increases in the following year. More importantly, we also find that after controlling for <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> and firm characteristics, in terms of all CEO pay changes and executive cash pay changes, there is a significant asymmetric pay adjustment between underpaid executives and overpaid executives in the sense that underpaid executives receive significant pay increases in the following year, while overpaid executives only receive insignificant pay decreases in the following year, leading to an upward ratcheting of top executive pay levels overtime. A critical insight generated from our results is that the use of peer benchmarking is strongly driven by the behavioural factors, leading to a systematic increase in top executive pay overtime. Firstly identifying the behavioural motives behind the widely use of peer benchmarking in top executive pay setting in advanced market, we therefore reach the conclusion that the behavioural factors {{play a key role in}} the determination of executive compensation. Further discussion reveals that after controlling for <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> and firm characteristics, the use of peer benchmarking has a significantly negative moderating effect on the pay-performance relation of CEO total pay, indicating that the irrational pay decision behaviour weakens the pay-performance sensitivity of executive compensation.

40|$|Japanese {{corporations}} and American and European corporations take different approaches {{when it comes}} to business in China in general : (i) American corporations are concentrated in the music, motion picture, and software industries, so they have a particular interest in solving copyright infringement problems; (ii) American and European corporations have started to actively use China as a base for research and development; and (iii) many American corporations have clear China-specific technological strategies.

Various aspects also differentiate Japanese corporations and American and European corporations in terms of the measures they take to combat counterfeit products : (i) American and European corporations show a similar trend as Japanese corporations toward taking administrative enforcement measures or civil proceedings, but a trend toward using criminal proceedings is emerging among American and European corporations; (ii) in American and European corporations, internal employees often prepare warning letters, conduct research, and collect evidence; (iii) the budget of American and European corporations for measures to combat counterfeit products is far greater than that of Japanese corporations; (iv) American and European corporations are active in exchanging information with and collecting information from governments; and (v) American corporations emphasize using estimated amounts of damages and quantifying the effectiveness of their measures to combat counterfeit products. Two key points stand out as being essential when considering measures to combat leakages of technology and infringements of trade secrets : (A) that good personnel management is effective as a measure for combating the leakage of technology and the infringement of trade secrets; and (B) that good information management is essential for preventing technology leakages and trade secret infringements. Many differences are evident between Japanese corporations and American and European corporations with respect to these measures : (i) American and European corporations are more active than Japanese corporations in willfully transferring technology to China; (ii) Japanese corporations are considerably less popular in China than American and European corporations; (iii) American and European corporations are more progressive in terms of assigning <b>managerial</b> <b>powers</b> to Chinese management personnel; (iv) the level of compensation offered at Japanese corporations in China is considerably lower than that offered at American and European corporations in China; (v) American and European corporations in China engage in corporate PR in many different ways, but Japanese corporations in China do not do enough; (vi) American and European corporations employ various initiatives to increase the motivation of Chinese personnel; and (vii) Regulations at American and European corporations provide severe punishment for personnel who divulge secrets.

Findings reveal that CEOs of acquiring firms receive signifi-cantly higher compensation in the year of completing M&As and one year after.

It is also found that the incentive alignment and <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> approach are not mutually exclusive and they both can have some degrees of explaining the variation of CEO compensation following mergers. We find a positive correlation between CEO com-pensation and firm performance, and some measures of CEO’s effort and skill in completing the deal. However, we observe that CEOs of bidding firms have significantly lower bonus and total compensation if there is any entrenchment in the CEO governance process (i. e.

S. executive compensation: U. S. executive compensation practices are failing, and systemic reform is needed. This review summarizes the book in some detail and offers some counter-arguments. The book's thesis is that executive compensation practices are bad for shareholders (not "optimal") because they are the product of "managerial <b>power.</b> " <b>Managerial</b> <b>power</b> arises because boards of directors at public companies are not independent of executives. Weak compensation committees thus do little to protect the firm in its pay negotiations with the CEO, leading to levels of executive pay that are both inappropriately high and have inappropriately low levels of incentives. The authors offer a four part analysis of CEO pay. First, they describe and critique optimal contracting theory, which posits that executive compensation arrangements are designed to benefit shareholders. Second, they explain <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> theory, in part through an in-depth analysis of current executive compensation practices. They assert the <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> theory provides a superior explanation of current practices to the optimal contracting perspective. They also draw the strong implication that if <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> exists, it means that something is wrong with the contracting process. Third, they claim that CEO compensation does not vary sufficiently with firm performance. They conclude with policy recommendations for changing compensation plans and improving corporate governance, for example by requiring that directors be more independent. We agree that it is useful to consider the effect of <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> on compensation, but we disagree with their interpretation of the consequences of this power. It is true that contract structures reflect CEO power, and that CEOs with more power get more pay, but this does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that CEO pay is not optimized for shareholders, nor does it imply that CEO pay needs reform. We show that in many settings where <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> exists, observed contracts anticipate and try to minimize the costs of this power, and therefore may in fact be written optimally. As a result, the optimal contracting and <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> perspectives are complementary, and not competing, explanations. We next examine Bebchuk and Fried's claim that U. S. compensation is inefficient "pay without performance. " Their analysis focuses on whether CEO annual pay varies with firm performance. While the book conducts an extensive analysis of the incentives provided by annual grants of stock options and equity it largely ignores the main source of CEO incentives: Large holdings of stock and options. These large equity holdings provide powerful performance incentives and ensure that the wealth of most CEOs varies strongly with their firm's stock price. The books' claim that CEO compensation is "pay without performance" does not appear correct once one considers this main source of CEO incentives. U. S. executives have very large pay-performance incentives, and their overall pay levels do not seem inappropriate. We conclude by examining some of Bebchuk and Fried's policy recommendations. Bebchuk and Fried have missed some important aspects of executive pay and incentives. They have not shown that there are systematic failures with U. S. CEO compensation, and therefore have not shown that reform is needed...|$|R

In contrast, the Compensating Wage Differentials Model argues {{that there is}} a non-positive relationship between positional power and total compensation. Both power and income yield utility and in equilibrium managers are prepared to trade-off the two elements. The two opposing propositions are tested using a large survey data set from Switzerland. The results suggest that power positions do not yield higher compensation. Rather, there is a non-positive relationship between power position and compensation, if one takes into account all relevant factors influencing total compensation.

40|$|Empirical {{research}} on executive compensation in China {{is very small}} compared to western countries, {{despite the fact that}} China is already the largest emerging economy. Moreover, most studies on executive compensation in China focus on the agency theory model and have produced mixed results. Little {{research on}} executive compensation has been done using alternative perspectives. This thesis explores management incentive issues by examining executive compensation in Chinese listed companies from three under-researched perspectives: the <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> model, tournament model and simultaneous model. All three models have been adapted to the Chinese context. The <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> model tests executive compensation from the <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> perspective. A new power dimension - political power - is added to Grabke-Rundell and Gomez-Mejia's (2002) <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> model in order to test the political influence on executive compensation in Chinese listed companies. The research findings support the hypothesis that political duality, which refers to Chairman/Party Secretary duality, is positively related to executive compensation in Chinese listed companies. The tournament model examines the organizational incentive structures. It studies the pay differences between organizational levels instead of studying the absolute level of pay, which provides an alternative incentive design other than the pay for performance mechanism. It is found that government ownership can weaken the tournament incentive in Chinese listed companies. Finally, the endogenous nature of executive compensation has been largely neglected by previous studies. This study contributes to the literature by examining executive compensation, managerial ownership, board characteristics and firm value in Chinese listed companies in a simultaneous model. The research findings show that executive compensation, managerial ownership and board characteristics are jointly determined in Chinese listed companies. Specifically, small boards help to control Highest Paid Director (HPD) compensation, to align the interests between HPD and the company and to increase firm value. Independent directors also help to align the interest between the HPD and the company and to increase firm value. Political duality (Chairman/Party Secretary duality) fails to control HPD compensation but it helps to control board size. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{monitoring}} effect from institutional ownership on bidder Chief Executive Officer (hereafter CEO) compensation in {{mergers and acquisitions}} (hereafter M&A) {{as well as the}} shift in compensation structure. While it is well-established in the literature that bidder CEO compensation soars significantly after conducting such transactions, the sources of the growth are left unclear. One major argument, the traditional theory, proposes that the growth derives from additional wealth created to shareholders in M&A, because according to the nature of compensation contract, CEOs’ interests are effectively aligned with shareholders’ benefits. On the other hand, scholars of <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> theory argue that <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> is stronger than shareholders’ oversight, so managers use M&A as a cover to expropriate wealth from shareholders. Whether the traditional theory or the <b>managerial</b> <b>power</b> theory dominates depends on the presence of optimal contract and the effectiveness of corporate governance. Institutional owners have more motivation and resources to restrict managerial behaviour than diffused owners. Thus, the change in CEO compensation following M&A and the driving factors behind the change could be different in firms with different types of ownership. After examining the 268 merger events from 266 US public non-family bidding firms from 2001 to 2005, this study finds that the magnitude of increase in CEO cash-based compensation is significantly alleviated in the presence of large institutional shareholders, and that the increase seems to be positively related to good short-term performance rather than <b>managerial</b> <b>power.</b> However, the concentrated institutional ownership does not seem to affect CEO equity-based compensation or the change in compensation structure. Besides, we do not find any significant relation between firm long-term post-acquisition performance and the market reaction to the announcement of M&A. Thus, we propose that without a reliable indication from short-term performance, large institutional shareholders could have problems in understanding the potential impact of M&A and they might adjust CEO equity-based compensation in a serial process after M&A...|$|R
