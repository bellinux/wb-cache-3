40|$|Work done at Case Western Reserve University on the Thermal Mechanical {{analysis}} of sprag helicopter clutches is reported. The report {{is presented in}} two parts. The first part is a description of a test rig for the measurement of the heat generated by high speed sprag clutch assemblies during cyclic torsional loading. The second part describes a finite element modeling procedure for sliding contact. The test rig provides a cyclic torsional load of 756 inch-pounds at 5000 rpm using a four-square arrangement. The sprag clutch test unit was placed between the high speed pinions of the circulating power loop. The test unit was designed to have replaceable inner ad outer races, which contain the instrumentation to monitor the sprag clutch. The torque loading device was chosen to be a water cooled <b>magnetic</b> <b>clutch,</b> which is controlled either manually or through a computer. In the second part, a Generalized Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for non-linear dynamic problems is developed for solid materials. This formulation is derived from the basic laws and axioms of continuum mechanics. The novel aspect of this method is that we are able to investigate the physics in the spatial region of interest as material flows through it without having to follow material points. A finite element approximation to the governing equations is developed. Iterative Methods for the solution of the discrete finite element equations are explored.

40|$|In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird die technische Machbarkeit eines direkt durch die Sonne angetriebenen Diffusions-Absorptionskälteprozesses nachgewiesen. Der Austreiber, der direkt in einen doppelt verglasten Flachkollektor integriert ist, stellt das zentrale Bauteil dieser Kältemaschine dar. Er ist gleichzeitig die Thermosiphonpumpe des Kälteprozesses. Üblicherweise wird diese im unteren Bereich des Rohres von Heizbändern mit einer hohen Wärmestromdichte beheizt. In einem kombinierten Kollektoraustreiber limitieren die Solarstrahlung und der Kollektorwirkungsgrad die {{maximale}} Wärmestromdichte. Zusätzlich muss die Thermosiphonpumpe aufgrund der Kollektorneigung entlang einer geneigten Ebene fördern. Diese Randbedingungen erfordern umfangreiche Untersuchungen zum Förderverhalten der Thermosiphonpumpe. Neben der Thermosiphonpumpe ist der Hilfsgaskreislauf, sowohl für die Kälteleistung als auch für den Wirkungsgrad des Diffusions-Absorptionskälteprozesses, von besonderer Bedeutung. Ein Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit ist die detaillierte Untersuchung des Hilfsgaskreislaufs. Mittels Clamp-On-Ultraschallsensoren gelingt es erstmalig den Ammoniakmolanteil sowie den Gasvolumenstrom kontinuierlich und ohne Eingriffe in den Prozess zu erfassen. Ein magnetgekoppelter Edelstahlpropeller ermöglicht, statt der üblichen Naturzirkulation, eine Zwangsumwälzung des Hilfsgaskreislaufs. Somit kann der Einfluss der Strömungsgeschwindigkeit auf die Stoffübertragung im Absorber und Verdunster nachgewiesen und bewertet werden. Mit den Messergebnissen wird ein neu erstelltes Simulationsmodell, welches die Stoffübertragung im Hilfsgaskreislauf abbildet, validiert. Aufbauend auf den Messergebnissen einer elektrisch beheizten Diffusions-Absorptionskältemaschine, den Förderversuchen der Thermosiphonpumpe und der Vermessung des Kollektoraustreibers im Sonnensimulator wird schlussendlich eine solarthermisch angetriebene Diffusions-Absorptionskältemaschine ausgelegt und aufgebaut. Durch einen anschließenden, erfolgreichen Test in einem Freiluftprüfstand wird die Funktionsfähigkeit des Anlagenkonzepts nachgewiesen. This work {{demonstrates that}} it is possible to operate a diffusion absorption chiller directly heated by a solar collector. The generator, as the main component of the chiller, is directly integrated into a double glazed flat plate collector. The generator also acts as the bubble pump of the refrigeration process. Normally the bubble pump is heated at the bottom of the tube by a heating tape with a high heat flux. In a combined generator/collector the maximum heat flux is limited by the solar radiation and the efficiency of the solar collector. Due to the inclination angle of the collector the bubble pump has to pump the solution upwards. These boundary conditions require extensive investigations of the performance of the bubble pump. In addition to the bubble pump the auxiliary gas circuit has a big influence on the coefficient of performance as well as the cooling capacity of the diffusion absorption chiller. A focus of this work is the detailed investigation of the auxiliary gas circuit. By means of clamp on ultrasonic detectors, it is possible for the first time to measure the ammonia molar fraction and the volume flow of the gas circuit continuously without influencing the process. A stainless steel propeller connected with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>clutch</b> offers measuring the influence of forced circulation of the auxiliary gas circuit instead of natural circulation. Thus, the influence of the flow rate on the mass transfer in the absorber and the evaporator can be demonstrated and evaluated. The measurement data are used to validate a new simulation model, which calculates the mass transfer in the auxiliary gas circuit. Based on the measurement results of the electrically heated chiller in the lab, the investigations of the bubble pump and the results of the generator/collector measured in the solar simulator, the solar heated diffusion absorption refrigeration system is designed and built up. Finally, the concept of a direct solar driven diffusion absorption chiller is demonstrated in an outdoor test facility...|$|E

50|$|The Acura RDX comes {{standard}} with a five-speed {{automatic transmission}} with Acura's SportShift sequential manual shift capability, activated by paddles {{mounted on the}} steering wheel.

40|$|In recent years, Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluids {{devices are}} widely studied {{and used for}} various purposes. Among these MR fluids devices, the MR {{actuator}} has attracted increasing attention for last two decades. An MR actuator is usually made of an active component (motor) and MR clutches. Compared with the regular actuators, the MR actuator features compliance due {{to the existence of}} MR fluids, which is commonly consider as benefits at the aspect of safety. On the other hand, the MR actuator has advantages on controllable bandwidth, torque-mass and torque-inertia ratios compared with the other compliant actuators. In this study, a new closed-loop, Field-Programable-Gate-Array (FPGA) based control scheme to linearize an MR clutch 2 ̆ 7 s input-output relationship is presented. The feedback signal used in this control scheme is the magnetic field acquired from hall sensors within the MR clutch. The FPGA board uses this feedback signal to compensate for the nonlinear behavior of the MR clutch using an estimated model of the <b>clutch</b> <b>magnetic</b> field. The local use of an FPGA board will dramatically simplify the use of MR clutches for torque actuation. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated using an experimental platform that includes an MR clutch as part of a compliant actuation mechanism. The results clearly demonstrate that the use of the FPGA based closed-loop control scheme can effectively eliminate hysteretic behaviors of the MR clutch, allowing to have linear actuators with predictable behaviors. Moreover, a novel optimization design of MR clutches is proposed. Based on the optimization, the characteristics of MR clutches in three common configurations are discussed and compared. People can select suitable configuration of MR clutch before design. Lastly, a lightweight mobile robot is developed by using MR actuators.
