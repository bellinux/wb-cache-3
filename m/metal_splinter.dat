40|$|The {{detection}} method {{is carried out}} in steps: (a) radiation of the object (104) under test with a radiation (106); (b) detecting the radiation in pixels, with the radiation penetrating the object under test; (c) determining an absorption value based on a multiple of pixels, lying in a predetermined surface area; (d) the absorption value is compared with a predetermined threshold value; (e) it is then determined, whether a foreign body {{is present in the}} object under test, based on the result of the comparison. The step (c) includes the adding up of the grey values of pixels (P(n)) of a line or a predetermined section to a line result (Z(m)) and further adding up the line results. USE - E. g. in foodstuffs industry to detect foreign bodies such as stones and <b>metal</b> <b>splinters.</b> ADVANTAGE - Facilitates variable position identification of foreign bodies in object under test with variable geometric dimensions, with high test throughput...|$|R
40|$|Wheels with {{polyurethane}} bandages are in common use in logistic systems with friction gear actuation. Many research projects {{have studied the}} mechanical construction of these heavy load wheels. The studies have been theoretical as well as experimental. Research interests {{at the department of}} machine elements include the wear in the presence of intermediate material on the contact area between the bandage surface and the contact surface on which the wheel rolls off. This problem, which is observed when examining this tribochemical system, has not been studied before. Within this project both one-phase intermediate materials such as sand, water, cutting-cooling-emulsion, <b>metal</b> <b>splinters</b> and two-phase intermediate materials such as sand/water and combinations of the latter were taken into consideration. In addition, the exposure of the bandage hardness, the cross linking agent of the polyurethane, the mechanical stress, and the slip are observed.

500|$|Kingsbury, {{along with}} the rest of the 7th Division, was shipped to the Middle East in late 1940. Spending time in Tel Aviv and the {{surrounding}} areas, the 7th Division continued training and awaited further orders. On 9 April, the division was sent forward to Mersa Matruh in Egypt to support the Commonwealth force's defences. It replaced a Scottish unit and took up positions in the garrison. On 23 May, Kingsbury's brigade was sent back to Palestine, en route to battle in Syria and Lebanon. The 2/14th fought against the Vichy French on the Lebanese mountain ranges, as part of a three-pronged attack on Beirut. During this time, the division fought in many towns, including a major battle in Jezzine, where Avery was wounded by a grenade—which drove <b>metal</b> <b>splinters</b> into his spine—and awarded the Military Medal for his [...] "cool courage and devotion". As the war with the Vichy French was winding down, on 11 July Kingsbury and Avery were selected for a contingent to collect and bury the dead.

2500|$|The hull {{below the}} waterline, {{along the main}} armour belt, formed the Side Protection System (SPS). It was {{subdivided}} {{into a series of}} longitudinal compartments in a void-liquid-void layout; the outer and inner were filled with air, and the middle compartment with liquid (fuel or water). The outer hull plating in the region of the SPS was thin to reduce potential splinter damage from a torpedo. The outer compartment of the SPS was normally an empty or void space (containing only air) and this allowed the initial explosion from a torpedo to expand while minimizing damage to the ship. The centre compartment was filled with oil or seawater and this spread the pressure pulse over a larger area while the liquid contained any <b>metal</b> <b>splinters</b> that were created from the torpedo explosion. The inboard compartment was another void space and served to contain any liquid leaking from the liquid layer and any remaining pressure pulse from the torpedo explosion. Inboard of the final void space was an armoured bulkhead which varied in thickness from 1.5 in (37mm) over the machinery spaces to 1.75inch (44mm) abreast of the magazines.

If this final inner bulkhead was penetrated a further set of subdivided compartments would contain any leaks; inboard of the holding bulkhead the ship was highly subdivided into small compartments containing auxiliary machinery spaces.|$|R
5000|$|As {{reported}} in Jenkins’ obituary: [...] In {{the early hours}} of 18 April, 43 Commando passed through 2 Commado’s position with the aim of clearing a pumping station and the fortified houses that dominated the surrounding country. When the commanders of 'D' and 'E' Troops were wounded, Jenkins, a 20-year-old subaltern, took over both troops and led the left prong of the attack. Reconnoitring ahead of his men, he was wounded in the neck and then hit in the back with a force which flattened him. After picking himself off the ground, astonished to be still alive, he found that he was {{on the edge of a}} German slit trench.Cocking his Colt [...]45 pistol, Jenkins fired blind into the trench. A terrified man jumped up shouting, 'Don't shoot! I'm an Austrian!' Jenkins first took him prisoner, and then the Spandau gunners who were little more than shapes in the darkness beside him. After sending them to the rear under the escort of a corporal with orders to return with a section of 'E' Troop, he found himself alone again.In the improving light, Jenkins saw a file of seven German soldiers with slung rifles emerge from behind a building. There was not a stitch of cover, so all that he could do was crouch down. The Germans stopped and started chatting to each other and, a few moments later, they were joined by two more.Jenkins stood up, marched forward, pointed his Tommy gun at them and bellowed: Hande hoch! After a moment of indecisiveness, they lowered their rifles to the ground and were sent to the rear with a group of marines which had made a timely reappearance.43 Commando was now exposed on a narrow salient with Germans on both flanks. Its diversionary assault had proved highly effective and it was ordered to pull back. When Jenkins had seen his troops into their new position, a doctor removed some <b>metal</b> <b>splinters</b> from his neck; the bullet that had knocked him down was discovered lodged among the biscuits in his 24-hour pack.|$|R
50|$|Slattery {{continued}} the radiology practice until 1911. Local doctors brought patients to his practice and word of his expertise developed. He built a thirteen-inch (33 cm) induction coil, sponsored by local individuals and this permitted shorter exposure times. He radiographed bone fractures along with <b>splinters,</b> <b>metal</b> shards {{and other objects}} embedded in the flesh. Slattery realized that the European-made focus tubes with prolonged use resulted in harder (or higher energy) X-rays as the vacua in the tubes increased. Slattery devised an improved regulator for the Crookes tubes and communicated these improvements to Röntgen, who replied with appreciation.|$|R
50|$|Instead of docking, {{the ferry}} angled {{away from its}} berth and slammed full-speed into a {{maintenance}} pier, a concrete platform supported by pilings. The pier ripped into the ferry's starboard side and tore into the boat's main deck where many passengers were crowding forward to disembark. As the concrete slab entered the boat, passengers screamed and ran for cover. Some jumped into the water. The accident left a number of victims trapped {{in a pile of}} <b>metal,</b> glass, and <b>splintered</b> wood. The accident was the worst in the ferry service's 98-year history. The ferry's hull, however, sustained no damage, and the vessel was never in danger of sinking.|$|R

ATL 5000 and PHILIPS iu 22 ultrasound systems were used with high-frequency linear-array probes, sterile material, local anaesthetic (lidocaine 2 %), scapels and surgical forceps. Antibiotic prophylaxis with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid were prescribed to all patients for 7 days after the procedure. Ninety-five FBs (39 glass, 35 metal, 17 vegetable, 2 plastic, 2 stone) were successfully removed under ultrasound guidance in all patients and the procedure took between 15 and 30 min. No complications arose either during or after the procedure. Seventy-five skin incisions were made and the wounds closed with Steri-Strips in 73 / 75 cases, whereas skin sutures were used in 2 / 75 cases. No complications arose either during or after the procedure. Ultrasound-guided removal of an FB {{retained in the}} soft tissues is a good alternative to surgery as is its relatively straightforward, inexpensive, repeatable and carries a low risk of complications. In addition, failure to remove an FB does not preclude traditional surgical removal. The advantages of this real-time procedure {{and the use of}} small instruments minimize bleeding time and avoid injury to surrounding structures. Patient compliance is enhanced {{by the fact that the}} procedure has little or no aesthetic impact. These encouraging results suggest ultrasound-guided removal as a first-choice procedure for the extraction of foreign bodies...|$|R

If this final inner bulkhead was penetrated a further set of subdivided compartments would contain any leaks; inboard of the holding bulkhead the ship was highly subdivided into small compartments containing auxiliary machinery spaces.The SPS void-liquid-void layer was generally about 13 feet wide, and the auxiliary machinery spaces added approximately another 8 feet of space from the outer hull plating to the major machinery spaces. The only exception to this was abreast A and B Engine Rooms, where the auxiliary machinery spaces were omitted, but another void space, about three feet wide was substituted in its place.Above the SPS, and directly behind the armour belt, was a series of compartments, typically used for washrooms or storage spaces, which were designed to allow for upward venting of overpressure from a torpedo hit. This scheme was designed to protect against a 1000 lb warhead, and had been tested and found effective in full-scale trials. The SPS was also a key component of the ship's damage control system, as lists resulting from flooding could be corrected by counterflooding empty void spaces, and/or draining normally liquid filled compartments. In the case of the loss of the Prince of Wales these spaces were used for counterflooding to reduce list.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Foreign body {{injuries}} with date thorns, <b>metal</b> and wooden <b>splinters</b> {{are common in}} Middle East region, as {{most of it is}} desert. Some of the injuries lead to cellulitis or abscess formation, if neglected or improperly managed results in osteomyelitis or septic arthritis of foot structures. This is the first report of isolated navicular osteomyelitis following neglected foreign body in a paediatric foot. Case Report: A 10 year old male patient presented with discharging sinus in left mid-foot 3 years after penetrating injury with wooden splinter. The diagnosis of navicular osteomelitis is confirmed with plain radio-graphs. The ultrasound of foot was done to localize the foreign bodies. Patient was treated with complete removal of foreign body (wooden splinters), surgical debridement and combination of IV and oral cloxacillin for period of 6 weeks. At 18 months follow up, patient had painless foot with no recurrence or collapse of navicular bone. Conclusion: The neglected foreign body can result in osteomyelitis of small bones of foot in pediatric patient. The ultrasound is more useful tool in localizing foreign bodies; those are not radio-opaque. Early and prompt diagnosis with adequate treatment of established osteomyelitis by complete removal of foreign body, curettage and antibiotics can give good results.
