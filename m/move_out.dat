5|$|The storm then {{continued}} north {{for twenty minutes}} over the North Shore suburbs of Sydney before regaining strength and veering northnorthwest again, redeveloping severe thunderstorm characteristics. The storm's redevelopment again caught the Bureau of Meteorology off-guard, who had expected the storm to dissipate and <b>move</b> <b>out</b> to sea without causing further substantial damage.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, the Kanak {{independence}} movement again picked up momentum when the United Nations placed New Caledonia on its Decolonisation List of Non-Self-Governing Territories in 1946. A major progression occurred when Kanaks and French {{settlers in the}} country obtained voting rights in 1951, shortly before it became an overseas territory of France in 1956. The Kanaks were then also allowed to <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of their reserve areas. This {{was followed by the}} establishment of the Territorial Assembly in 1957, but this was short-lived; Charles de Gaulle abolished it after he became the President of France, in 1958.|$|E
5|$|After {{agreement}} {{from the}} Cardiff Athletic Club, the freehold {{of the south}} ground was transferred solely to the WRU in July 1968. Work could then begin on the new National Stadium. Glamorgan County Cricket Club would move to Sophia Gardens and the cricket ground to the north would be demolished and a new rugby union stadium built for Cardiff RFC, who would <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of the south ground, allowing the National Stadium to be built, for the sole use of the national rugby union team.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the penalty was taken, the Welsh dugout was {{surrounded}} by press and photographers, as the home team were still leading 1–0. With the scores levelled, the pack switched {{their attention to the}} Scottish bench, which led to Stein remonstrating with at least one photographer to <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of the way of his view of the game. Both Professor Stewart Hillis, the Scotland team doctor (who was also Stein's consultant), and Welsh manager Mike England stated that there appeared to be nothing wrong at this point.|$|E

5|$|In 1926 the United States {{government}} {{forced the}} railroad to <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of its headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. Although Harrison threatened {{to take the}} company headquarters to Atlanta, in the end a new headquarters building was built on McPherson Square. Harrison installed a private lobby entrance leading to a private elevator to the 10th and 11th floors. The railroad took occupancy of the building {{in the middle of}} 1929.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{researchers}} {{note that}} mammals and birds {{get the most}} attention but smaller creatures {{at the base of}} the ocean food chain are also harmed by the oil. Life on the sea floor and near the shore such as mussels, barnacles, and other shellfish are unable to <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of the way. When exposed to oil, these organisms suffer 90%-plus mortality and recovery of the population can take decades.|$|E
5|$|Now infected, Wesley uses {{a digital}} sample of Captain Picard's voice to lure key {{engineering}} crew-members {{away from the}} engineering deck. He erects a force field around the area with his tractor beam device and assumes control of the ship. He allows one of the engineers, Mr. Shimoda (Benjamin W.S. Lum), who is acting in a childlike manner, into the force field. Mr. Shimoda manages to remove all of the isolinear chips from the engine control station and plays with them like toys. As the supergiant star collapses, a fragment is blown into a direct impact course with the two Federation ships, and without the chips in place, they cannot <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of its way. Chief Engineer Sarah MacDougal (Brooke Bundy) manages to disable Wesley's force field, and Data is sent to replace the chips. He reports {{that he will not}} have enough time. Wesley reverses the ship's tractor beam, repelling the Enterprise off the Tsiolkovsky, giving themselves the necessary additional seconds for Data to replace the chips enabling the ship to <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of the way. The crew is cured of the ailment, and Picard partially credits Wesley for helping to prevent a disaster.|$|E

5|$|On 30 June, {{government}} forces attempted to <b>move</b> <b>out</b> {{of the air}} base and link up with troops at the university but failed after encountering heavy insurgent resistance in the al-Deum area. A military spokesman said that {{government forces}} were massing in Samarra and would soon make another push to capture Tikrit. Meanwhile, south of Tikrit, the army managed to recapture the town of Mukayshifah in fighting that an army spokesman claimed killed 40 ISIS fighters.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August the Greater Bairam (a feast day {{celebrating the}} end of the Islamic year) coincided with the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps at Romani being ordered to <b>move</b> <b>out</b> with {{supplies}} for the advancing troops, but 150 men, most of whom were past {{the end of}} their contracts and entitled to be discharged, refused orders to fill their water bottles, draw their rations and saddle up. One man was hit about the head with the butt of a pistol and the dissenters were dispersed into small groups and reassigned to various units in the infantry division; the 52nd (Lowland) Division.|$|E
5|$|Residents {{began to}} <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of the centre into the {{suburban}} areas which {{were included in}} Odense Municipality after boundaries were redefined in 1970. As a result, the population declined slightly in the 1970s and 1980s, falling to 136,646 in 1981. It began climbing again in the late 1980s, and steadily grew to 144,518 in 1996 and 145,554 in 2004. In 2010 Odense had a population of 166,305 people. As of 2017 it had a population of 176,683.|$|E

5|$|The building's {{restoration}} {{work was}} scheduled for 2002, however the operators of the polyclinic were reluctant to leave, having occupied the building for over 40 years. In order to force the occupants out of the building, the workers boarded {{up all of the}} windows and threatened to do the same to the doors if the polyclinic did not vacate the premises. Only the president's involvement in the matter forced the polyclinic to <b>move</b> <b>out</b> completely.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} {{built in the}} mid-18th century {{as part of the}} New Road, a bypass of Central London for coach traffic. It was named Pentonville Road after the new town of Pentonville, that encouraged manufacturing to <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of the city and into suburbia. Numerous factories and commercial premises became established on the road in the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly after the arrival of London railways in the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other Portia species, P. fimbriata in Queensland readily invades {{the nests}} of cursorial spiders, {{plucking}} or cutting the nest. If the resident spider eventually leaves the nest, P. fimbriata stalks it. If the resident spider tries to counterattack and then retreats into the nest, P. fimbriata may attack the other spider as it re-enters the nest, or may wait motionless until the prey exits. If a stabbed prey spider retreats into the nest, P. fimbriata in Queensland never enters the nest, but {{waits for the}} prey to <b>move</b> <b>out,</b> and then P. fimbriata kills it.|$|E

5|$|When {{the third}} statehouse was {{condemned}} in 1876 the government abandoned the building. The General Assembly relocated {{to a large}} office building that had been built in 1865 and was already housing the Supreme Court. The Governor and the executive staff relocated to another office building. The office building {{was used as the}} statehouse during the interim period that the new statehouse was being built. In 1887, before the new statehouse had been completed, enough of the lower floors were usable for the government to <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of the cramped office space and begin holding sessions in the new structure.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} the offseason hunting with Smoky Joe Wood, Coveleski {{returned to the}} Indians in 1921, and throughout the season, the Indians battled the Yankees for first in the American League. On September 26, the two teams faced off, but Coveleski failed to make it past the third inning; the Yankees won 8–7 to ensure they won the pennant. Coveleski pitched 315 innings in 1921, matching his career high from the year before, and had a 23–13 record and a 3.37 ERA. The following season, Coveleski married Frances Stivetts, the sister of his late wife. While he did cause the Yankees to <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of first place after winning an August 23 game against them, 4–1, it was his last game of the season. He finished the year with a 17–14 record, {{the first time since}} 1917 he did not have 20 wins, and a 3.32 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips to <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of the line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold {{on the underside of the}} weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
