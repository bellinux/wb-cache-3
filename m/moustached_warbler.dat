5|$|A {{review of}} spectacled warbler records was {{initiated}} in 1984. This review {{resulted in the}} species being removed from the British list; of the three accepted records, one, at Spurn, Yorkshire in 1968, was re-identified as a first-year female subalpine warbler, while descriptions of the other two, at Porthgwarra, Cornwall in October 1969 and on Fair Isle in June 1979, were not considered sufficiently watertight to permit their continued acceptance. Spectacled warbler has since been re-added to the British list following an individual at Filey, Yorkshire in 1992, {{and there have been}} further subsequent records. In the late 1990s, BBRC reviewed some of the accepted records of <b>moustached</b> <b>warbler,</b> and concluded that one, from Sussex in 1979, was unacceptable, but that one other, from Buckinghamshire in 1965, should stand. Two further records, from Hampshire in 1951 and Kent in 1952, were reviewed as part of the 1950–1957 review (see below), and found to be unacceptable. Following these rejections, the Buckinghamshire record, and the remaining record, a breeding pair in Cambridgeshire in 1946, previously accepted as Britain's first, were scrutinised by the BOURC and found to be unacceptable, leading to the removal of <b>moustached</b> <b>warbler</b> from the British list; it has not re-occurred.|$|E

50|$|The {{birds of}} the lake are the following: <b>Moustached</b> <b>warbler,</b> whiskered tern, black tern, common tern, stork, red-crested pochard, greylag goose.Among the fishes {{of the lake}} cobitis turcica is an endemic species of Turkey.|$|E
50|$|The African warblers inhabit a {{range of}} {{habitats}} in sub-Saharan Africa. These range from primary rainforest to forest edge and open woodland habitats for the longbills, wooded savanna to arid scrubland and bushland in the crombecs, rocky arid scree areas and grassland for the rockrunner, and grassland for the <b>moustached</b> grass <b>warbler</b> and Cape grassbird. The family is overwhelmingly non-migratory, although the <b>moustached</b> grass <b>warbler</b> and the northern crombec both make some localised movements in West Africa related to the rainy season.|$|R
50|$|The long, pointed, straggly tail, {{chestnut}} cap {{and facial}} stripes are diagnostic of Cape grassbird. It {{is much larger}} than any cisticola, and the heavily streaked back and the pointed tail eliminate confusion with <b>moustached</b> grass <b>warbler.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>moustached</b> grass <b>warbler</b> (Melocichla mentalis) is {{a species}} of African warbler, {{formerly}} placed in the Sylviidae family.It is widely found throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, although absent in southern parts of the continent.Its natural habitats are moist savanna and subtropical or tropical moist shrubland.|$|R
50|$|Species seen: whinchat, redstart, pied flycatcher, woodchat shrike, Sardinian warbler, nightingale, Audouin's gull, blue rock thrush, crag martin, black vulture, Thekla lark, Marmora's warbler, Cory's shearwater, purple swamphen, great reed warbler, <b>moustached</b> <b>warbler,</b> black-winged stilts, bee-eater, cirl bunting.|$|E
50|$|The <b>moustached</b> <b>warbler</b> has the {{northern}} margin of its range {{and the only}} nesting locality in the Slovak republic in Parížske močiare. Other species present are mallards and Eurasian coots. Other bird species present in the nature reserve are Garganey, Greylag goose, Western marsh harrier, Little bittern, European bee-eater and Little crake.|$|E
50|$|The {{bird species}} include: common {{pheasant}} Phasianus colchicus, common quail Coturnix coturnix, shore lark Eremophila alpestris, redshank Tringa totanus, stone curlew Burhinus oedicnemus, <b>moustached</b> <b>warbler</b> Acrocephalus melanopogon, golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos and short-toed snake eagle Circaetus gallicus. Also there is sighting of Eurasian griffon vulture Gyps fulvus probably on their flight over to Cres.|$|E
50|$|The African warblers {{range in}} size from the smaller crombecs, which measure 8 cm in length and weigh as little as 6.5 g, to the Cape grassbird, which {{measures}} 19 - 23 cm in length and the <b>moustached</b> grass <b>warbler</b> which weighs 29 - 40 g. There is considerable difference in appearance between the genera; for example the two grass warblers and Victorin's warbler possess long graduated tails, whereas the crombecs have tails of which barely extend beyond the tail coverts and folded wings.|$|R
50|$|Breeding is {{seasonal}} {{and usually}} timed {{to coincide with}} the end of the dry season and beginning of the rainy season; in species with large ranges this can lead to considerable variation as to the exact timing. Information is lacking in many species, but for those that have been studied the African warblers are territorial and monogamous. Nest design varies within the family; the crombecs construct deep pocket shaped nests suspended from a branch; whereas the Victorin's warbler, Cape grassbird and <b>moustached</b> grass <b>warbler</b> construct cup nests weaved from grass.|$|R
50|$|Specials: Anchieta's tchagra, <b>moustached</b> grass-warbler, red-winged <b>warbler,</b> black-winged bishop, red-faced crimsonwing, lesser seedcracker, singing cisticola, twinspot indigobird which parasitizes the red-throated twinspot, scarce swift, pallid honeyguide, green-backed woodpecker, stripe-cheeked greenbul, yellow-streaked greenbul, silvery-cheeked hornbill, white-eared barbet, pale batis, black-throated wattle-eye, {{variable}} sunbird, bronzy sunbird, olive sunbird, yellow-bellied waxbill, grey waxbill, blue-spotted wood-dove, black-fronted bush-shrike.|$|R
50|$|The <b>moustached</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus melanopogon) is an Old World warbler in {{the genus}} Acrocephalus. It breeds in {{southern}} Europe and southern temperate Asia {{with a few}} in north-west Africa. It is partially migratory. South west European birds are resident, south east European birds winter in the Mediterranean breeding range, and the Asiatic race migrates to Arabia, India and Pakistan.|$|E
50|$|There are 214 {{recorded}} {{species of}} birds, 140 {{of them being}} protected as natural rarities. Most of the species are migratory. Richness of birds {{is one of the}} primary reasons for the environmental protection of the lake's area. bearded reedling is the most outstanding characteristic bird, while white-headed duck, ferruginous duck and <b>moustached</b> <b>warbler</b> are just some listed on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

50|$|The Parco dell'Oglio Sud {{is another}} {{regional}} park that {{lies on the}} boundary of the province with the province of Cremona. It was established in 1988 and has an area of about 12,800 hectares. It is a river park that runs along the stretch of the river Oglio which forms the boundary. It lies {{to the south of}} Lake Iseo and the administrative centre is at Calvatone. Birds present in this park include great egret, grey heron, Montagu's harrier, Eurasian scops owl, bearded reedling, woodcock, barred warbler, crested lark, sedge warbler, <b>moustached</b> <b>warbler,</b> little egret, Eurasian hobby and ferruginous duck.|$|E
50|$|Bonaparte {{was the son}} of Lucien Bonaparte and Alexandrine de Bleschamp, and {{a nephew}} of Emperor Napoleon I. Born in Paris, he was raised in Italy. On 29 June 1822, he married his cousin, Zénaïde, in Brussels. Soon after the marriage, the couple left for Philadelphia in the United States to live with Zénaïde's father, Joseph Bonaparte. Before leaving Italy, Carlo had already {{discovered}} a warbler new to science, the <b>moustached</b> <b>warbler,</b> and on the voyage he collected specimens of a new storm-petrel. On arrival in the United States, he presented a paper on this new bird, which was later named after Alexander Wilson.|$|E
50|$|Various aquatic species {{exist in}} the lagoons such as eels, grey mullet, fresh water shrimp and above all the Spanish toothcarp which is endemic to the Spanish Mediterranean region. But without any doubt the parks best known feature is the bird life. The most notable of the many species present in the park are the marbled duck and the white-headed duck with the park {{containing}} two of the largest worldwide populations. A large number of herons are present during the breeding season particularly the purple heron, the night heron and the squacco heron. It is also possible to find other species such as the avocet, the black-winged stilt, the collared pratincole, the crested coot, the European penduline tit and the <b>moustached</b> <b>warbler.</b> Birds of prey include osprey, marsh harrier and (in winter) greater spotted eagle. An Estonia-born greater spotted eagle wearing a transmitter has been hibernating {{in the park and}} its surroundings each winter since 2008/2009.|$|E
5000|$|A few {{highland}} {{bird species}} reach their southernmost occurrence here, namely the Chirinda apalis (type locality), Swynnerton's robin, a globally threatened monotypic genus, stripe-cheeked greenbul (A. m. disjunctus), <b>moustached</b> <b>warbler</b> (M. m. orientalis), white-tailed flycatcher and yellow-bellied waxbill. [...] Wide-ranging African species include crowned eagle, trumpeter and silvery-cheeked hornbills, both breeders, Livingstone's turaco, lemon dove, green pigeon, owls, nightjars, bee-eaters, pygmy kingfisher, yellow-streaked (P. f. dendrophilus) and sombre greenbuls, yellow-throated (S. r. alacris), Barratt's (B. b. priesti) and broad-tailed warblers, olive and black-fronted bushshrikes, Cape batis, sunbirds and firefinches. Various bird races were first described from this location: a strikingly coloured race of red-necked spurfowl (P. a. swynnertoni), a fulvous-coloured race of wailing cisticola (C. l. mashona), {{a race of}} bar-throated apalis (A. t. arnoldi), the smallish, dusky and streaky-throated Swynnerton's thrush (T. o. swynnertoni) which is endemic to the Eastern Highlands, and a race of olive sunbird (C. o. sclateri). The forest is situated too low for orange thrush, Roberts's warbler, malachite or bronze sunbirds, and too high for yellow-spotted nicator, white-eared barbet or grey waxbill. Crested guineafowl however inhabits its lower elevations and green malkoha recently populated the forest from lower altitudes. Blue-mantled flycatchers occupy the lower altitudes or fringing thickets, but remain segregated from white-tailed flycatchers which occupy the forest proper or higher canopy.|$|E
50|$|The wetland {{supports}} a high diversity of birds, {{with at least}} 239 species reported since 2001 in the area recognised as an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area. The wetland is also recognised as a birding hotspot in eBird with 282 bird species recorded as of May 2017. The bird life of Basai Wetland includes the following species of conservation concern as per the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species:Two critically endangered vulture species were reported to occur in Basai Wetland in the past: White-rumped vulture and Red-headed vulture. Presently, {{a large number of}} resident bird species, including many typical of wetlands, some of which breed in the hundreds occur in Basai Wetland, including Grey-headed swamphen, Cattle egret, Black bittern, Cinnamon bittern, Yellow bittern, and Yellow-bellied Prinia. The wetland is also used by birds such as Grey-headed Lapwing, Watercock, and Greater flamingo. Basai wetland also provides an important habitat for migratory birds. In winter, around 1100 Bar-headed Goose have been reported, while up to 5,000 ducks of 18 species and 10,000 waders of 36 species occur during spring and autumn passage migration. Among the many migrant bird species found here over the winter are Wood sandpiper, Smoky warbler, <b>Moustached</b> <b>warbler,</b> Common grasshopper warbler, Water rail, Baillon's crake, Great bittern, Water Pipit, and Common crane. During winter, several thousand Citrine wagtail and Yellow wagtail are also known to roost in Basai Wetland.|$|E
40|$|I {{studied the}} area {{requirement}} of reedbed breeding passerine birds on 109 reed islands in Lake Velence, Hungary, in the breeding seasons of 1993 and 1994. The {{size of the}} smallest occu-pied reed island for the observed 8 passerine bird species varied from 0. 02 ha (Savi’s Warbler Locustella luscinioides) to 4. 14 ha (Bluethroat Luscinia svecica). Three species occupied reed islands which were 8 – 18 times larger than their territory sizes (Sedge Warbler Acrocephalus schoenobaenus, <b>Moustached</b> <b>Warbler</b> A. melanopogon, and Bluethroat), three species oc-curred on reed islands 4 – 4. 5 times larger than territory sizes (Great Reed Warbler A. arundi-naceus, Reed Warbler A. scirpaceus, and Reed Bunting Emberiza schoeniclus), and two spe-cies occurred on islands {{half the size of}} their territory sizes in continuous reedbeds (Bearded Tit Panurus biarmicus, Savi’s Warbler). This may suggest that the latter two species can uti-lise groups of small patches within a territory. The incidence functions showed that the proba-bility of occurrence of the <b>Moustached</b> <b>Warbler</b> and the Bluethroat was not 1 even on the larg-est reed islands (7 – 25. 7 ha), while it was 1 for the other 6 species. The importance of landscape matrix type in determining minimum area requirements was demonstrated using data on the occurrence of bird species in reed marshes within an agricultural landscape in the Po Plain (It-aly). In this landscape much larger minimum areas were found than at Lake Velence. Key words: incidence function, area sensitivity, edge effect, landscape matri...|$|E
