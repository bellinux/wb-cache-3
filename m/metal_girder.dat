5|$|The {{bodies of}} Mussolini and Petacci {{were taken to}} Milan and left in a {{suburban}} square, the Piazzale Loreto, for a large angry crowd to insult and physically abuse. They were then hung upside down from a <b>metal</b> <b>girder</b> above a service station on the square. Initially, Mussolini was buried in an unmarked grave but, in 1946, his body was dug up and stolen by fascist supporters. Four months later it was recovered by the authorities who then kept it hidden for the next eleven years. Eventually, in 1957, his remains were allowed to be interred in the Mussolini family crypt in his home town of Predappio. His tomb has become a place of pilgrimage for neo-fascists and the anniversary of his death is marked by neo-fascist rallies.|$|E
500|$|Their {{bodies were}} left in a heap, and by 9:00a.m. a {{considerable}} crowd had gathered. The corpses were pelted with vegetables, spat at, urinated on, shot at and kicked; Mussolini's face was disfigured by beatings. An American eye witness described the crowd as [...] "sinister, depraved, out of control". After a while, the bodies were hoisted up on to the <b>metal</b> <b>girder</b> framework of a half-built Standard Oil service station, and hung upside down on meat hooks. This mode of hanging {{had been used in}} northern Italy since medieval times to stress the [...] "infamy" [...] of the hanged. However, the reason given by those involved in hanging Mussolini and the others in this way was to protect the bodies from the mob. Movie footage of what happened appears to confirm that to be the case.|$|E
50|$|The {{adjoining}} bridge (Foster's Bridge) over Lower Street {{was originally}} {{built as a}} two-track brick arch, but was widened later with a <b>metal</b> <b>girder</b> section.|$|E
50|$|Built {{completely}} in metal, it has three lights in <b>metal</b> <b>girders</b> {{and is about}} 131 meters long.|$|R

50|$|Opened in 1897, it {{consists}} of 59 arches spread either side of four <b>metal</b> <b>girder</b> spans which cross the river itself. Nine million bricks were used in its construction which cost £65,000.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{its larger}} brother - the PGM Hécate II (chambered in [...]50 BMG), the PGM 338 is {{structured}} around a central rigid <b>metal</b> <b>girder</b> chassis, {{giving it a}} skeletal [...] "barebones" [...] appearance to minimize weight and simplify maintenance.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{extended}} westwards in 1938-39 {{when a new}} span was added to cross the Yarra Boulevard, which was constructed by sustenance workers during the Depression as a scenic drive. In 1971, the original piers were strengthened and a <b>metal</b> <b>girder</b> span added to accommodate a third track.|$|E
50|$|Between Horrabridge and Whitchurch Down {{the line}} passed over Magpie Viaduct Walkham Viaduct, the longest on the line; it was rebuilt in 1910 using <b>metal</b> <b>girders.</b> The line then passed through Grenofen Tunnel (374 yards).|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{comprises}} two 60 {{foot plate}} girder spans with timber longitudinals and timber approach spans including 36 foot spans strengthened with strut and crown, other spans by truss and tie rods. <b>Metal</b> <b>girders</b> are continuous over two spans and support cross-girders at lower flange level. These carry longitudinal timber stringers {{on which the}} rails rest.|$|R
5|$|Endeavour docked {{with the}} ISS on 2 December 2000, on mission STS-97, {{bringing}} four more Americans and a Canadian temporarily to the station. The shuttle also brought the {{first pair of}} U.S. provided photovoltaic arrays, which would provide crucial electricity for further development of the station. In total, STS-97 brought 17tons of equipment to the ISS, which also included expandable <b>metal</b> <b>girders,</b> batteries, electronics and cooling equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{its larger}} {{brothers}} - the PGM Hecate II (chambered in [...]50 BMG) and PGM 338 (chambered in [...]338 Lapua Magnum) - the PGM Ultima Ratio is structured around a central rigid <b>metal</b> <b>girder</b> chassis, {{giving it a}} skeletal [...] "barebones" [...] appearance to minimize weight and simplify maintenance.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge over}} the Broken River, of iron plate-girder construction, was the longest <b>metal</b> <b>girder</b> bridge in Australia {{at the time of}} construction, totalling 241.7 metres. Listed on the Victorian Heritage Register, it was the second bridge of its type built in Victoria, and the first metal railway bridge both {{designed}} and fabricated within the colony.|$|E
50|$|The mines {{have now}} been closed and filled in, {{but some of the}} line's route through the village can be identified. Between the village and the station, much of the line's right of way is now {{occupied}} by a geologically themed hiking trail, which also crosses the four span <b>metal</b> <b>girder</b> bridge that is the line's main surviving relic.|$|E
50|$|As of 2009, {{the bridge}} is a <b>metal</b> one-span <b>girder</b> bridge, {{constructed}} from box-shaped beams on stone foundations.|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} {{has been}} largely replaced and now has an arcade with retail shops through to Duncan Street {{on the ground floor}} and modern offices and apartments on the upper floors. In the centre of the building what {{appears to have been a}} clerestory is preserved together with its ceiling decoration. The floors below it have been replaced by <b>metal</b> <b>girders</b> to create a light well. No other original internal decoration can be readily seen.|$|R
50|$|Victoria Bridge was {{originally}} {{one of only}} two <b>metal</b> <b>girder,</b> swing bridges in Australia. It was an all steel structure except for wooden decking. A central drum, from which the central span swung open, housed the gas, free piston Otto engine. A row of modern shops has been built along its length, with a restaurant under the eastern end of the structure. An office is located beneath the western end.|$|E
50|$|The section from Régua (also {{known as}} Peso da Régua) to Vila Real was opened in 1906. The {{extension}} to Chaves {{was built in}} stages, but not completed until 1921. The distance from Regua to Chaves was 97 kilometres. The first short section of track north from Regua was dual gauged (including a large <b>metal</b> <b>girder</b> bridge over the Corgo River), shared with the main Iberian gauge Douro railway line.|$|E
50|$|Apart from Victoria Bridge, {{built in}} 1888-1889, {{the only other}} <b>metal</b> <b>girder</b> swing bridge {{constructed}} in Australia was the smaller one over the Forth River at Leith in Tasmania, built in 1884. Tenders were called by the Department of Works, Bridges Branch, on 25 September 1885 for the Townsville structure. A tender submitted by G.H. Royce & Co. of Sydney was accepted {{at a cost of}} &pound;18,868. The approaches were constructed by Robertson & Stein and cost &pound;1,780.|$|E

50|$|Music on hold {{was created}} by Alfred Levy, an inventor, factory owner, and entrepreneur. In 1962, Levy {{discovered}} {{a problem with the}} phone lines at his factory. He discovered that a loose wire was touching a <b>metal</b> <b>girder</b> on the building. This made the building a giant receiver so that the audio broadcast signal from a radio station next door would transmit through the loose wire and could be heard when calls were put on hold. Levy patented his work in 1966. While other advancements have come to change and enhance the technology, it was this initial patent creation that began the evolution for today's music on hold.|$|E
5000|$|The {{memorial}} comprises 16 bronze [...] "standards" [...] {{set out on}} {{a grassy}} slope at the east end of the Hyde Park Corner traffic island. Each standard is a cross-shaped <b>metal</b> <b>girder</b> weighing about 700 kg, cast by the Heavy Metal Company in Lower Hutt, and set in a concrete foundation, with surrounds of British slate. The dark patinated surfaces of the standards are adorned with different texts, patterns and small sculptures, all symbolic of New Zealand, including fern shapes, a manaia figure, plants and animals from New Zealand, emblems of the New Zealand armed forces, and references to authors and artists from New Zealand.|$|E

5000|$|The Talbot Avenue {{bridge in}} Montgomery County, Maryland, is an {{historic}} one-lane <b>metal</b> <b>girder</b> bridge that connects Lyttonsville and downtown Silver Spring. Originally built in 1918, {{with a new}} deck added in 1986, it crosses the CSX railroad tracks between Hanover Street and Lanier Drive. The structure is 106 feet long and 14.5 feet wide, from timber curb to curb and an out-to-out width of 18 feet. The greater structure consists of a through-plate girder in the center span, rolled girders in the end spans, timber floor beams, a wood plank deck and a timber railing. A 1993 inspection report indicated the structure was in fair to poor condition with cracking, corrosion and section loss. The wood and steel on the bridge has been in disrepair, making it a hard keep intact.|$|E
5000|$|Rawnsley and Sir Robert Hunter of the National Trust led the {{opposition}} to the council's proposal. They were supported by The Times, The Manchester Guardian and the Royal Automobile Club, and the proposal was dropped. The old bridge survived for another 43 years, until it was damaged beyond repair by floods in December 1954. A temporary <b>metal</b> <b>girder</b> Callender-Hamilton bridge was placed across the river, to carry alternating one-way traffic, and a new permanent bridge was built [...] downstream, allowing the diversion of the main road to by-pass the village. After the new road bridge was opened, the temporary metal structure was replaced by a new pedestrian bridge on the old site, allowing foot traffic between Portinscale and Keswick on the path across the fields known as the Howrahs.|$|E

50|$|Garnier's works {{represent}} a Neo-Baroque-inspired style, popular during the Beaux-Arts period in France. He {{was influenced by}} the Italianate styles of Renaissance artisans such as Palladio, Sansovino, and Michelangelo, perhaps the result of his many visits to Greece and Rome during his lifetime. He was also a pioneer of architectural beauty as well as function; his opera was built on a framework of <b>metal</b> <b>girders,</b> unprecedented at the time. Aside from being fireproof, steel and iron was much stronger than wood, allowing it to successfully withstand the countless heavy tons of marble and other materials heaped upon it without breaking.|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this report was to develop the {{structural}} method of sheet <b>metal</b> <b>girders</b> and should for that reason be considered solely from this standpoint. The ensuing methods {{were based on the}} assumption of the infinitely low stiffness in bending of the metal web. This simplifies the basis of calculations {{to such an extent that}} many questions of great practical importance can be examined which otherwise cannot be included in any analysis of the bending stiffness of the buckled plate. This report refers to such points as the safety in buckling of uprights to the effect of bending flexibility of spars, to spars not set parallel, etc...|$|R
