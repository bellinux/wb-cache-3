500|$|The State Election Committee {{defined the}} polling stations's {{appearance}} and their immediate surroundings up to [...] away, prohibiting campaigning and displaying of promotional materials there as with elections in Croatia. Unlike Croatian elections, {{there is no}} mandatory halt to campaigning before a referendum. GONG appointed approximately 300 observers to monitor the referendum voting. The Election Committee {{announced that it would}} start publishing voting results on its web site two hours after the polling stations in Croatia closed, and it would expect to determine the referendum's outcome by midnight. If a proposed question was supported by a simple majority of those voting, the proposal would be considered passed and the result binding on the Croatian Parliament pursuant to §87, paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Croatian Constitution. Since the referendum passed, the Croatian Parliament was required to ratify the Croatian EU accession treaty. Amendments (from 2010) to the constitution provide that referendums are valid regardless of actual turnout. If the referendum proposal were to have failed, it could have been repeated in six <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> It is estimated that a referendum rejection would have cost Croatia approximately €1.6billion in lost EU funding until 2014.|$|E
500|$|In April 1957 Boris Ford, Head of Schools Broadcasting at Associated Rediffusion (A-R), {{wrote to}} Britten, proposing {{a series of}} half-hour programmes. These would show Britten {{composing}} and rehearsing a work through to its performance, and would provide children with [...] "an intimate piece of musical education, by... watching {{a piece of music}} take shape and in some degree growing with it". Britten was initially cautious; he found the idea interesting but, he warned Ford, he was at that time [...] busy [...] travelling, and had little time for writing. He was also anxious not to cover the same ground as he had with Let's Make an Opera. However, he agreed to meet Ford [...] to discuss the project further. On 11 July they met in London, together with Britten's musical assistant Imogen Holst. Britten told Ford that he had [...] "for some <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> vaguely been thinking of doing something with the [...] miracle plays", and agreed to write an opera for A-R's 1958 summer term of school programmes. The subject would be Noah and the flood, based on the Chester text. Later, Ford and his script editor, Martin Worth, travelled to Aldeburgh, and with Britten looked at possible churches for the performance. The Church of St Bartholomew, Orford, was chosen as, unlike most other churches in East Suffolk, its pews were not fixed, thus offering a more flexible performing space.|$|E

2500|$|Kadhim {{began writing}} the book in December 2010, a time he {{described}} as gloomy with no hope {{of change in the}} Arab World. Then, when the Arab Spring began, he was deeply shaken by the rapid developments and the early victories achieved in Tunisia and Egypt, and described them as [...] "a rain that fell suddenly on a barren desert". Therefore, he decided to stop writing and rethink the book's thesis, which until then had been influenced by the previous gloomy atmosphere. The stop was only expected to last for few <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> at most until the events unfolded. But Kadhim only resumed writing in September 2012, a time when some countries were still in upheaval, while others were in transition. He was determined and motivated to re-examine the original thesis, to defend the Arab Spring, and most importantly to defend [...] "the hope that this Spring had revived".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to food shortages, the Gulag suffered from labor scarcity {{at the beginning}} of the war. The Great Terror of 1936-1938 had provided a large supply of free labor, but by the start of World War II the purges had slowed down. In order to complete all of their projects, camp administrators moved prisoners from project to project. [...] To improve the situation, laws were implemented in mid-1940 that allowed giving short camp sentences (4 <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>year)</b> to those convicted of petty theft, hooliganism, or labor-discipline infractions. By January 1941 the Gulag workforce had increased by approximately 300,000 prisoners. But in 1942 serious food shortages began, and camp populations dropped again. The camps lost still more prisoners to the war effort. (The Soviet Union went into total war footing in June 1941.) [...] Many laborers received early releases so that they could be drafted and sent to the front.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{strategic}} level, {{the attack was}} a disaster for Japan, rousing American passions for revenge due to it being a [...] "sneak attack". The shock of the attack coming in an unexpected place, with such devastating results and without the expected [...] "fair play" [...] of {{a declaration of war}} galvanized the US public's determination to avenge the attack. When asked by Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe in mid-1941 about the outcome of a possible war with the United States, Yamamoto made a well-known and prophetic statement: If ordered to fight, [...] "I shall run wild considerably for the first six <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> but I have utterly no confidence for the second and third years." [...] His prediction would be vindicated as Japan easily conquered territories and islands {{for the first six months}} of the war until it suffered a shattering defeat at the Battle of Midway on June 4–7, 1942, which ultimately tilted the balance of power in the Pacific towards the US.|$|E

Five directors, five actors, five times five: she gets phone calls. A hundred movies in four months. She's not a fresh face any more. Her price slips and she stops getting phone calls.
