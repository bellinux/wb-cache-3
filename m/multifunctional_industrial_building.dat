40|$|Developed {{countries}} have experienced economic restructuring {{in the past}} decade which leads to deindustrialization. Many <b>industrial</b> <b>buildings</b> are left vacant or under-utilized owing to global economic shift from developed countries to developing countries of lower wages. The shift of economic activities from manufacturing to financial and business services causes tremendous increase in the value of properties in urban areas. Many artists cannot afford the high land cost and move to some of the <b>industrial</b> <b>buildings</b> which are converted into other uses such as studio. Hong Kong also experienced similar economic restructuring {{in the past decade}}. <b>Industrial</b> <b>buildings</b> become vacant or under-utilized. The Hong Kong Government of Special Administrative Region worked out the Revitalizing <b>Industrial</b> <b>Building</b> policy to expedite urban regeneration of industrial areas and optimize land use. Wholesale conversion and redevelopment is regarded as potential means to revitalize <b>industrial</b> <b>buildings.</b> Based on a series of case studies of different revitalizing <b>industrial</b> <b>buildings</b> in Hong Kong, this paper analyzes the potential measures to enhance the revitalizing process. The research identified facilitating measures that can be categorized into three main aspects, which includes rezoning old industrial areas into more diverse uses; government can offer some financial benefits to owners and provide appropriate facilities in neighbourhood.

Their rental fee, including cost of installing air conditioners and other equipment, accounts, for the largest part of their expenses.

40|$|Abstract The {{adaptability}} {{is important}} in the technological reformation of <b>industrial</b> <b>building.</b> Bracket girder and cut column (BGCC), are widely used to expand the space and to increase the inner working room of the buildings. Reformation of the exiting <b>industrial</b> <b>building</b> is limited to the continuous and non-stop working and (must be) in service and the reformation is required to be non-stop. <b>Industrial</b> <b>buildings,</b> especially the <b>industrial</b> single-storey workshops mostly belong to static determinate and low-order static indeterminate structures and many risks may be faced during the BGCC reformation under the complicated working conditions, such as variable structure risk, structural failure caused by overload, injuries of workers resulted from the unsafe construction, injuries of the production workers due to construction operation, etc. Research on the safety risk management of the <b>industrial</b> <b>building</b> BGCC reformation is of great significance for ensuring the technological transformation of industrial enterprises and controlling the risks from the reformation of adaptability of <b>industrial</b> <b>buildings</b> in China. Consequently, based on the approaches of risk identifying on work decomposition structure(WBS) and the questionnaire, the whole process design and construction management methods are proposed to control the risks in the reformation of the exiting <b>industrial</b> <b>buildings,</b> and the total management of construction process can be used to reduce injury risks of engineering staffs. In this paper, the technological key points of the whole process design control and construction management are discussed in details based on examples of BGCC reformation of exiting <b>industrial</b> single-storey <b>buildings</b> and the corresponding injury risk management methods are suggested.
