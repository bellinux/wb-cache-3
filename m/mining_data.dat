5|$|Limited {{knowledge}} of the taxonomy, biogeography and natural history of deep sea communities prevents accurate assessment {{of the risk of}} species extinctions from large-scale <b>mining.</b> <b>Data</b> acquired from the abyssal North Pacific and North Atlantic suggest that deep-sea ecosystems may be adversely affected by mining operations on decadal time scales. In 1978, a dredge aboard the Hughes Glomar Explorer, operated by the American mining consortium Ocean Minerals Company (OMCO), made a mining track at a depth of 5000meters in the nodule fields of the CCFZ. In 2004, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER) conducted the Nodinaut expedition to this mining track (which is still visible on the seabed) to study the long-term effects of this physical disturbance on the sediment and its benthic fauna. Samples taken of the superficial sediment revealed that its physical and chemical properties had not shown any recovery since the disturbance made 26 years earlier. On the other hand, the biological activity measured in the track by instruments aboard the manned submersible bathyscaphe Nautile did not differ from a nearby unperturbed site. This data suggests that the benthic fauna and nutrient fluxes at the water–sediment interface has fully recovered.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Motivated by {{the need}} for {{unification}} of the domain of <b>data</b> <b>mining</b> {{and the demand for}} formalized representation of outcomes of <b>data</b> <b>mining</b> investigations, we address the task of constructing an ontology of <b>data</b> <b>mining.</b> In this paper we present an updated version of the OntoDM ontology, that is based on a recent proposal of a general framework for <b>data</b> <b>mining</b> and it is aligned with the ontology of biomedical investigations (OBI). The ontology aims at describing and formalizing entities from the domain of <b>data</b> <b>mining</b> and knowledge discovery.
