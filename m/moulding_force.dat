The production series will be 150, 000 pieces per year. A combination of shearing and bending in the combined tool was selected from a variant solution as the most suitable technology of manufacturing. Based on technological and structural calculations, a tool was designed with lower pressure pad at the bend point. For this tool was also made fundamental drawings. In view of the total <b>moulding</b> <b>force</b> and work, LEN 40 C press with the nominal force 250 kN (manufactured by TOMA INDUSTRIES s. r. o.) was selected.

25|$|One {{aspect of}} cricket-keeping, that of growing molded, custom-shaped gourds {{destined to become}} cricket homes, was an {{exclusive}} monopoly of the Forbidden City. The royal gardeners would place the ovary of an emerging Lagenaria fruit inside an earthen <b>mould,</b> <b>forcing</b> the fruit {{to take up the}} desired shape. The oldest surviving molded gourd, Hasshin Hyōko dated 1238, is preserved in Hōryū-ji temple in Japan. The art reached its peak in the 18th century, when the gardeners implemented reusable carved wood and disposable clay molds. The shapes of the gourds were tailored to different species of cricket: larger gourds for larger species, long-bottle gourds for the species known for long hops, and so on. Immature fruit easily reproduces the artwork carved into the mold, but also easily picks up any natural or man-made impurities. The finest craftsmen exploited, rather than concealed, these blemishes. Molded gourds were a symbol of the highest social standing. The ones held by Chinese royalty depicted in medieval portraits were actually prized cricket containers. The Yongzheng Emperor held a gourd in his hand even when he was sleeping, the Qianlong Emperor maintained a private molded gourd garden. In the 1800s the Jiaqing Emperor lifted the monopoly on molded gourds, but they remained expensive even for the upper classes.|$|R

40|$|Following the {{increasing}} prominence of celebrity in mass media {{and in several}} social fields, a number of scholars have coined the term “celebritization”. They use this term to qualify the trend in our mediatized societies whereby “celebrity capital”, or being famous, has become a valuable asset besides social, cultural and economic capital. However, although the term celebritization is being increasingly used in literature, {{it has not yet}} been systematically defined. Therefore, this paper aims to conceptualize the process of celebritization, which will be undertaken in two steps. First, by theoretically disentangling the different underlying dynamics of celebritization, and second, by discussing its <b>moulding</b> <b>forces,</b> or its relationship with other processes. Celebritization, in our view, consists of three main dynamics. First, there is a (relative) democratisation of fame, since it is increasingly detached from meritocracy and achievement. Second, we can observe a diversification of celebrity, as several social fields, among which the political or religious field, are also producing their own celebrity personalities. Third, there is a transgression of celebrity, as several celebrities penetrate into other social fields than those in which they have originated (e. g., musicians endorsing politicians). Next, we argue that celebritization can be conceived as a product of mediatization, personalization and commodification. Mediatization {{can be thought of as}} both a precondition and a catalyst for celebritization. Personalization means that individuals come at the forefront at the expense of institutions or structural factors, and entails a shift from the professional persona to the private (or popular) persona – which is exactly one of the definitions of celebrity. Finally, celebritization implies that these famous individuals are commodified: they are produced in capitalist systems and turned into brands. In our conclusion we discuss the major implications of this conceptualization and some possibilities for empirically testing it...|$|R

He was the spirit of scurrility incarnate, that was, as people say, innate; and by virtue of those <b>moulding</b> <b>forces</b> he was {{doing his best to}} be an English gentleman. That mysterious impulse which compels the young male to make objectionable imputations against seemly lives and to write rare inelegant words upon clean and decent things burnt almost intolerably within him, and equally powerful now was the gross craving he had acquired for personal association with all that is prominent, all that is successful, all that is of good report. He had found his resultant in the censorious defence of established things. He conducted the British Critic, attacking with a merciless energy all that was new, all that was critical, all those fresh and noble tentatives that admit of unsavoury interpretations, and when the urgent Yahoo in him carried him below the pretentious dignity of his accustomed organ he would squirt out his bitterness in a little sham facetious bookstall volume with a bright cover and quaint woodcuts, in which just as many prominent people as possible were mentioned by name and a sauce of general absurdity could be employed to cover and, if need be, excuse particular libels. So he managed to relieve himself and get along. Harman was just on the border-line of the class he considered himself free to revile. Harman was an outsider and aggressive and new, one of Mrs. Blapton's knights, and of no particular weight in society; so far he was fair game; but he was not so new as he had been, he was almost through with the running of the Toomer gauntlet, he had a tremendous lot of money and it was with a modified vehemence that the distinguished journalist and humourist expatiated on his offensiveness to Mr. Brumley.

40|$|Legitimation and {{competition}} {{are two major}} <b>forces</b> <b>moulding</b> organizational field and the diffusion of innovations. While discursive legitimation provides "rational justifications" for innovations, competition may incite organizations to acquire effective innovations preemptively. This paper draws on {{a case study of}} the legitimation and diffusion of a sophisticated medical technology to suggest that, in highly regulated environments, these two forces may interact, and that opposing legitimation strategies may be associated with competition. We argue that while convergent discursive legitimation strategies tend to speed up the diffusion process, divergent discursive legitimation strategies may have the opposite effect. The case suggests that the dominant logics of legitimation may shift, oscillating between convergence and divergence as an innovation diffuses. We also show how the resulting delays in diffusion may be pre-empted by a phenomenon we call institutional delinquency, that is when the moral and cognitive-cultural legitimacies of the technology among professionals and managers becomes sufficient to counteract regulatory forces. technology, legitimation, institution, innovation, PET scanner, theorization, competition...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHOD: Ninety extracted human teeth were used for the fracture resistance test. The apical foramen was prepared to a diameter of 1. 0 mm or 1. 4 mm to simulate the open apex of immature teeth. MTA was mixed according to manufacturer's recommendations and placed into the root canals with different apical foramen diameter by four different root filling techniques: retrograde, two-phased orthograde, and ortograde with or without internal matrix. Prepared roots were marked 2 mm below the cemento-enamel junction and embedded in transparent acrylic resin in cylinder <b>moulds.</b> Vertical <b>force</b> was applied along the long axis of the tooth at a speed of 5 mm/min, and the maximum resistance to fracture for each tooth was determined in Newton.

RESULTS: A statistically significant difference could not be observed between the groups (p> 0. 05) whereas statistically significant differences were found between the test groups and the control groups (p< 0. 05).

As to the latter, the acceptance of classical generali-zations of the nature of succession has led to particular difficulties in the assessment and interpreta-tion of recovery. Tree fall, which creates gaps, is fundamental to the development of many forests, and has been most intensively studied in tropical forests of Central America and the Amazon and in temperate forests of North America. Tree fall is part of autogenic change; mechanisms of gap-filling and subsequent growth and species composition vary widely with forest ype and geography.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} the {{relationship}} between the geographies of law, society, economy and the physical environment in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century rural England. It uses as its exploring ground the operation of the Old Poor Law in rural Oxfordshire. This county was chosen because it was both a microcosm of the farming landscape of Southern England {{and was one of the}} counties where the problem of poor relief was most acutely felt. Chapter 1 establishes that the mapping out of spatial diversity, and the consideration of the <b>forces</b> <b>moulding</b> it, is fundamental to an understanding of the functioning of the Old Poor Law. Chapter 2 uses data contained in the parliamentary returns to demonstrate some clear regional differences in the level of poor relief and the chronology of change. Chapters 3 and 4 show that these regional averages and trends do not make intelligible the kaleidoscopic welter of local variations indicated by a closer examination of parish records. Chapters 5 and 6 consider poor relief expenditure in four parishes: Cropredy, Pyrton, Spelsbury and Stoke Lyne. These show that differences in the level of poor relief expenditure cannot automatically be taken to indicate variations in the level of what we might think of as unemployment or poverty. The generosity of disbursements, and therefore the real incomes of the poor, could also vary markedly between parishes. Thus, the Old Poor Law cannot be detached from the particular places in which it acquired its meaning and saliency. Its impact upon the daily lives of ratepayers, administrators and recipient can be established and the poor treated as individuals rather than as abstract units of labour. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{changing}} {{relationship between}} community and class {{has been a}} subject generally neglected by historians. Marxist social theory provides little framework for {{the examination of the}} significance of community in capitalist society. This study of the industrial suburbs of Leeds indicates the importance of community consciousness, both as a <b>force</b> <b>moulding</b> class relations in Victorian society, and as a cognizance itself shaped by class relations. It is argued in chapter two that the relatively monolithic culture of the clothing villages was, by the 1830 's, cracking under the pressures of factory capitalism. Suburban attitudes towards community institutions and traditions became permeated and modified by class interests. Chapter three shows how deference and paternalism were fashioned in the factory politics of the 1820 's and 1830 's, while suburban autonomy came to be threatened by municipal centralization. Chapter five examines the changing role of patronage in suburban religion and education, and analyses petty-bourgeois perceptions of community. However there was much continuity as well as change. Chapter two argues that several characteristics of clothier culture survived industrialization. Chapter three shows how national political divisions were often subsumed by local loyalties. The long tradition of labour radicalism was partly preserved by the mid-Victorian labour aristocracy. It is argued in chapter four that their labour consciousness was firmly rooted in the local community. Petty-bourgeois community sentiment, examined in chapter five, developed from the traditions of sectarianism and localism. Deference and paternalism revived after 1848 and remained important throughout the century. However there was never a factory culture in Leeds suburbs to match that of Lancashire. In chapter six it is argued that few of the institutions of social control, constructed by patronage from the 1830 's, ever gained popular acceptance. There were other 'community institutions', from dame schools to friendly societies, which were of greater importance to the fabric of out-township life. It is concluded that community consciousness was preserved by the working class both in the sense of place and of past. As class conflict developed in the industrial suburbs, so the struggle to appropriate local traditions, the sense of history, of 'milieu', and of community itself, became part of this conflict...|$|R

Many children are experiencing challenges in coping with their emotions such as aggression and managing anger in their daily lives that a need has arisen for the facilitation of aggression management for secondary school learners through a Psycho-Educational Programme. This programme included new skills that are necessary for successful living and learning, thus focusing on life skills that enable secondary school learners to apply their knowledge, attitudes and values – what humans think, feel and believe and how to cope with an emotion like aggression. The researcher followed a structured framework in four steps in order to conduct the research, which adhered to the requirements of a qualitative and quantitative strategy. In step one the researcher followed an inductive reasoning strategy with a contextual, descriptive and exploratory focus (situation analysis). Secondary school learners' experience of aggression in their school was explored through individual phenomenological interviews conducted with a purposively selected sample and by means of field notes made {{at the conclusion of the}} interview process. The interviews proceeded until data were saturated. Guba’s model of trustworthiness strategies: credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability were applied. Each interview was audio taped and then transcribed. The data were then analysed according to Tesch’s (Creswell, 1994 : 154 - 155) descriptive, qualitative and systematic approach to data reduction where after a literature control was conducted. According to the data analysis four themes were identified: - learners experience aggression as part of their life; - aggression encompasses interpersonal relationships; - learners describe aggression as a negative experience; and - learners articulate measures to manage aggression. In step two the collected data from phase one was used to develop a Psycho-Educational Programme for secondary school learners who experience aggression in order to facilitate aggression management. During step three, two {{secondary schools}} were chosen. After selection the schools were randomly assigned as an experimental and control group. Secondary school learners were then randomly selected as participants from grade eleven learners at their schools. A questionnaire was used for pre-test and post-test purposes. Adherence to internal validity, external validity, reliability and objectivity ensured the trustworthiness of the process. The programme was presented to the experimental group only. The control group was treated exactly like the experimental group except that they did not receive the experimental treatment but a placebo programme as the group was only included for comparison reasons. In step four the evaluation of the Psycho-Educational Programme was done which enabled the researcher to focus clearly on the ultimate purpose of meeting the aims and purpose of this research study. The researcher can confidently express his trust and confidence in the Psycho-Educational Programme that was developed, implemented and evaluated. The evaluation of the data indicated that the questionnaires that were used as a measuring tool were reliable, appropriate and valid. The results indicated that the variables: self-awareness, interpersonal relationships and management of conflict were effectively included in the Psycho-Educational Programme and had a significant impact on the participants who took part in the experimental group. The placebo programme had no significant effect on the participants of the control group. In conclusion, mixed research methods of the qualitative and quantitative approaches were effective as it supported each other during this research study. Prof. C. P. H. Myburgh Prof. M.

40|$|In {{the work}} that is {{described}} in this thesis we studied a new cast iron based composite material that was produced by a double casting technique using sedimentation sand casting. The material {{is based on the}} high Cr white cast irons (WCI) 15, 20 % Cr-Mo- LC and 25 % Cr matrixes, according to ASTM A 532 - 75 a and was designed to exceed the wear life of wear resistant materials that are used in cement, mining, coal extraction and chemical and process industries currently. The working region of the material extends to a depth of 5 - 8 mm below the surface and is an in situ and ex situ particle reinforced composite. WC particles of different sizes (1 - 3 and 3 - 5 mm) were selected as the ex situ reinforcements. Thus, the composite consisted of a WCI matrix, which was reinforced with WC and other transition metal carbide particles. A sand casting method was developed during which the WC particles were directed to a specific location in the ingot and were distributed uniformly in the near surface area of the composite (the working region of the material) during casting/solidification of the ingot. This ensured chemical bonding between the high Cr WCI and the particle reinforced composite (the working region) at a well defined interface parallel to the working surface. Solidification of the melt started from the WC particles around which three reaction zones were formed. Owing to partial dissolution of the WC particles and the resulting interdiffusion of elements such as W, Co, Fe, C and Cr, carbides containing Fe, Cr, W and Co were formed in the reaction zones. It is shown that current models for the interaction between a reinforcing particle and an advancing S/L interface in liquid route MMCs cannot describe the present case successfully because the solidification of the melt starts around the WC particles after the latter have settled in the near surface region of the casting. Two new approaches have been studied; in the first the WC particles travel through the iron melt and settle {{at the bottom of the}} mould and in the second WC particles settled at the bottom of the <b>mould</b> experience the <b>forces</b> of the liquid flow. The solidification paths of the three WCI matrixes and MMCs have been simulated with the Scheil-Gulliver model using the Thermo-Calc software for different iron based alloy systems, by changing the W, Cr and C concentrations. In the WCI, carbides solidify after the austenite. The increase in Cr from 14 to 25 wt. %, for fixed C (at 2, 2. 5 or 3 wt. %), causes the stabilization of phases according to cementite M 7 C 3 FCC (stable). Only for Cr up to 30 wt. % and C up to 2. 5 wt. % the cementite is replaced by the BCC phase. The increase in C content from 2 to 3 wt. % for fixed Cr (at 14, 20 or 25 wt. %) has the same effect. In the MMC, the increase in W from 15 to 25 wt. % causes the stabilization of M 6 C. As the C increases from 2. 5 to 6 wt. %, first the M 7 C 3 is stabilised and for C > 4 wt. % the MC phase is favoured. The increase in Cr leads in the formation of the M 23 C 6 while simultaneous increase in Cr and C promotes the M 7 C 3 phase and restrains the formation of the M 6 C that resulted from the increase of W. Finally the simultaneous increase of C, W and Cr stabilize the MC phase for > 4 wt. % C. The wear of the new materials was evaluated both in an industrial scale and in the laboratory (pin-on-disc). Segments of an industrial pulverising ash mill used in the cement industry were manufactured using the casting method and materials developed in this thesis. The results showed an improvement in the wear life of the component of several times compared to the standard high Cr WCI material used by the same industry to date...|$|R
