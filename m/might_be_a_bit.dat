Yiddish theater was banned in Russia {{starting}} September 14, 1883, as part of the anti-Jewish reaction following the assassination of Czar Alexander II. Goldfaden and his troupe were left adrift in Saint Petersburg. They headed various directions, some to England, some to New York City, some to Poland, some to Romania.|$|E

It also is categorized in genres like speed metal and heavy metal. Thom Jurek said Lombardo's percussion beats [...] "are WAAAAAAAY up in the mix," [...] and said that [...] "you can understand every word, even on the thrashers" [...] about Tom Araya's vocal style. [...] "he guitars are simply further down in the mix and sometimes it becomes difficult to discern Araya's bass. Therefore, the first listen or two to World Painted Blood <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> confusing for the seasoned Slayer fan, but that changes quickly, {{and the sound of}} those drums blasting in one's head will become a more than welcome presence in the mix." ...|$|E
500|$|Wenger {{clarified}} Vieira's future {{after the}} match: [...] "My intention is clear: {{to keep him}} [...] The challenge {{in front of us}} is hugely difficult and we need a complete focus. I'm not resigned to let the story go on. It has all to be sorted out before the season." [...] He added that if Vieira chose to leave, the club could sufficiently replace him: [...] "We've worked very hard {{in the last five years}} to get good young players in and you saw that today." [...] Reyes, who was named man of the match, was frustrated at his missed chance early in the second half, but continued: [...] "I set one up and then scored myself so I was much happier." [...] Bergkamp was impressed with Fàbregas's performance in the match: [...] "Normally at 17, you <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> unsure when you step out. But with players like Cesc, the way he has developed in one year is quite amazing." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite this, {{shortly after}} the British race McLaren's {{experienced}} team manager Teddy Mayer decided not to continue with Villeneuve for the following year. His explanation was that Villeneuve [...] "was looking as though he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> expensive" [...] and that Patrick Tambay, the team's eventual choice for 1978, was showing similar promise. Villeneuve was left with no solid options for 1978, although Canadian Walter Wolf, for whom Villeneuve had driven in Can-Am racing, considered giving him a drive at Wolf Racing. Rumours circulated that Villeneuve {{was one of several}} drivers in whom Ferrari's team was interested, and in August 1977 he flew to Italy to meet Enzo Ferrari, who was immediately reminded of the pre-war European champion Tazio Nuvolari: [...] "When they presented me with this 'piccolo Canadese' (little Canadian), this minuscule bundle of nerves, I immediately recognised in him the physique of Nuvolari and said to myself, let's give him a try." [...] Ferrari was satisfied with Villeneuve's promise after a session at Ferrari's Fiorano test track, despite the Canadian making many mistakes and setting relatively slow times, and Villeneuve signed to drive for Ferrari in the last two races of the 1977 season and the 1978 season. Villeneuve later remarked that: [...] "If someone said to me that you can have three wishes, my first would have been to get into racing, my second to be in Formula 1, my third to drive for Ferrari..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nina Paley {{expressed}} {{surprise at}} the adverse reaction, saying [...] "I thought it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> controversial, but I wasn’t fully aware of how art and artists are major targets of some right-wing nationalist groups in India. I always imagine an audience of smart, compassionate people I’d enjoy spending time with."

2500|$|There is no {{dispute that}} illegal naked {{shorting}} happens, {{what is in}} dispute is how much it happens, {{and to what extent}} is DTCC to blame. Some companies with falling stocks blame DTCC as the keeper of the system where it happens, and say DTCC turns {{a blind eye to the}} problem. Referring to trades that remain unsettled, DTCC's chief spokesman Stuart Goldstein said, [...] "We're not saying there is no problem, but to suggest the sky is falling <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> overdone." [...] In July 2007, Senator Bennett suggested on the U.S. Senate floor that the allegations involving DTCC and naked short selling are [...] "serious enough" [...] that there should be a hearing on them with DTCC officials by the Senate Banking Committee, and that banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd has expressed a willingness to hold such a hearing.|$|E
2500|$|The seventh {{track on}} Odd Blood, [...] "Rome", {{features}} beats taken from Moroccan and Syrian dance music that Keating's wife {{had on her}} iPod, while for [...] "Strange Reunions", Yeasayer created a short song under three minutes by exploring unconventional time signatures in different parts {{in the style of}} fellow New York City band Dirty Projectors. [...] "Mondegreen" [...] follows and is an old song created by Keating using samplers plugged into a television set. Using four channels which showed programs like infomercials and soap operas, he recorded four banks of sound and structured a song by singing on top of the material. The last track, [...] "Grizelda", is, according to Tuton, [...] "a nice way to close an album. It lulls you into sitting back in your chair, puts you in a trance a bit, although the subject matter <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> dark." ...|$|E

5000|$|On the song's meaning, Adam Franklin stated: I don't {{know why}} we called it 'Sandblasted'. I think it <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> {{subliminal}} because someane wrote something about us once and mentioned sandblasted images and maybe the words stuck in my head or something. The song's all about being {{out of it and}} being by the sea, walking along the beach being blasted. They've been sandblasting my Rat recently as well.|$|R
2500|$|Many of {{his later}} {{paintings}} and {{works on paper}} shifted toward [...] "romantic symbolism", and their titles can be interpreted visually through shapes and forms and words. Twombly often quoted the poets as Stéphane Mallarmé, Rainer Maria Rilke and John Keats, {{as well as many}} classical myths and allegories in his works. Examples of this are his [...] Apollo and The Artist and a series of eight drawings consisting solely of inscriptions of the word [...] "VIRGIL". In a 1994 retrospective, curator Kirk Varnedoe described Twombly's work as [...] "influential among artists, discomfiting to many critics and truculently difficult not just for a broad public, but for sophisticated initiates of postwar art as well." [...] After acquiring Twombly's Three Studies from the Temeraire (1998–99), the Director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales said, [...] "Sometimes people need a little bit of help in recognising a great work of art that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> unfamiliar." [...] Twombly is said to have influenced younger artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Anselm Kiefer, Francesco Clemente, and Julian Schnabel.|$|E

[...] In January 2015, after Orci's departure, Simon Pegg and Doug Jung were hired to rewrite the screenplay, with Pegg saying on the previous draft, Paramount [...] "had a script for Star Trek that wasn't really working for them.
