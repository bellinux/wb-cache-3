On more than one occasion, male guardsmen would <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the USCG had struggled along without women for over 150 years. Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply failed to {{see the need for}} women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the ropes, and gave them encouragement.|$|E

[...] The story seems to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> [...] "knowing" [...] a thing is simply a state of mind, {{and that it is}} not {{possible}} to determine if that knowing has any objective validity.

500|$|With the Sumter issue unresolved, Seward sent Lincoln a {{memorandum}} on April 1, proposing various courses of action, including possibly declaring war on France and Spain if certain conditions were not met, and reinforcing the forts along the Gulf of Mexico. In any event, vigorous policies were needed {{and the president}} must either establish them himself or allow a Cabinet member to, with Seward making it clear {{he was willing to}} do it. Lincoln drafted a reply indicating that whatever policy was adopted, [...] "I must do it", though he never sent it, but met with Seward instead, and what passed between them is not known. Seward's biographers <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the note was sent to a Lincoln who had not yet proved himself in office.|$|E
500|$|Kolbe's {{recognition}} as a Christian martyr also created some controversy within the Catholic Church. While his ultimate self-sacrifice of his life was most certainly considered saintly and heroic, he was not killed strictly speaking out of odium fidei (hatred of the faith), but {{as the result of}} an act of Christian charity. Pope Paul VI himself had recognized this distinction at his beatification by naming him a Confessor and giving him the unofficial title [...] "martyr of charity". Pope John Paul II, however, when deciding to canonize him, overruled the commission he had established (which agreed with the earlier assessment of heroic charity), wishing to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the systematic hatred of (whole categories of) humanity propagated by the Nazi regime was in itself inherently an act of hatred of religious (Christian) faith, meaning Kolbe's death equated to martyrdom.|$|E

500|$|Not {{only did}} the Department of Information art advisors {{consider}} these new works dull, but the War Office censors also objected to three of the paintings. Nevinson was quite happy to reverse the direction of traffic in the painting The Road from Arras to Bapaume but {{was not prepared to}} compromise over the other two paintings. The censor objected to A Group of Soldiers on the grounds that [...] "the type of man represented is not worthy of the British Army". Amid the sarcasm and vitirol of Nevinson's response, he did <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the soldiers in the painting were sketched from a group home on leave from the Front that he had encountered on the London Underground. The canvas was eventually passed for display. Not so Paths of Glory, Nevinson's painting of two fallen British soldiers in a field of mud and barbed wire. Told at the beginning of 1918 that the painting would not be passed for exhibition Nevinson insisted on displaying it with a brown strip of paper across it, with the word 'Censored' scrawled on it. This earned Nevinson a reprimand not just for displaying the painting but using the word 'Censored' without authorisation.|$|E
2500|$|Wat Phra Dhammakaya often {{emphasizes}} Mae Ji Chandra's illiteracy, to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> {{she became}} a spiritual leader solely because of her character and spiritual maturity, rather than academic knowledge.

2500|$|Some reform-minded {{cardinals}} initially {{voted for}} Leo Joseph Suenens of Mechelen-Brussels and Franz König of Vienna to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the pope {{does not have}} to be Italian. Other reports said that conservative cardinals attempted to block Montini's election in the early balloting. Due to the apparent deadlock, Cardinal Montini proposed to withdraw himself from being considered but was silenced by Giovanni Urbani the Patriarch of Venice. Another cardinal, Gustavo Testa, an old friend of John XXIII, lost his temper in the Chapel and demanded that the intransigents stop impeding Montini’s path.|$|E
2500|$|De Gaulle and his Foreign Minister Bidault {{stated that}} they were not in favour of a 'Western Bloc' that would be {{separate}} from the rest of Europe, and hoped that a resurgent France might be able to act as a 'third force' in Europe to temper the ambitions of the two emerging superpowers, America and Soviet Union [...] He began seeking an audience with Stalin to press his 'facing both ways' policy, and finally received an invitation in late 1944.

2500|$|Soon {{after this}} {{exchange}} fighting broke out at Restalrig with casualties on both sides. Some French mounted arquebusiers who pursued an English detachment were {{killed on the}} slopes above Leith, or captured by the sea-shore. Over 100 French casualties were reported with 12 officers killed {{and a number of}} prisoners taken. George Buchanan and John Hayward's 17th century history <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the French were trying to secure the high-ground to the south of Leith: Hawkhill, the crag (at Lochend), and the chapel, which the French journalist of the siege called the [...] "Magdalene Chapel".

2500|$|There is some {{difference}} of opinion as to how revolutionary the events of 1688–89 actually were, and several commentators <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> {{the provisions of the}} English Bill of Rights did not represent new laws, but rather stated existing rights. Mark Thompson wrote that, apart from determining the succession, the English Bill of Rights did [...] "little more than set forth certain points of existing laws and simply secured to Englishmen the rights of which they were already posessed [...]" [...] Before and after the English Bill of Rights, the government could always disarm any individual or class of individuals it considered dangerous to the peace of the realm. In 1765, William Blackstone wrote the Commentaries on the Laws of England describing the right to have arms in England during the 18th century as a natural right of the subject that was [...] "also declared" [...] in the English Bill of Rights.|$|E
2500|$|The King {{family and}} {{others believe that}} the {{assassination}} {{was carried out by}} a conspiracy involving the U.S. government, as alleged by Loyd Jowers in 1993, and that Ray was a scapegoat. In 1999 the King family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Jowers for the sum of $10 million. During closing arguments, the Kings' attorney asked the jury to award damages of $100, to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> [...] "it was not about the money". During the trial both the family and Jowers presented evidence alleging a government conspiracy. The government agencies accused could not defend themselves or respond because they were not named as defendants. Based on the evidence, the jury concluded that Jowers and others were [...] "part of a conspiracy to kill King" [...] and awarded the Kings $100. The allegations and the finding of the Memphis jury were later rejected by the United States Department of Justice in 2000 due to lack of evidence.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> essay <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> to {{establish}} an American identity people need {{to break away from}} Europe, from its history, its politics, and its culture. Instead, Martí urges Americans to instead to mine the rich history of the Americas. He says, “The history of America, from the Incas to the present must be taught in clear detail and to the letter, even if the archons of Greece are overlooked. Our Greece must take priority over the Greece which is not ours”. [...] Here Martí <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> for America to succeed it must use the knowledge and history that pertains to it and that European ideas were not formed in America and therefore do {{not take into account the}} realities of this American continent.|$|R

2500|$|Autism is {{classified}} by psychologists as a disorder, {{rather than the}} variation in functioning preferred by supporters of neurodiversity, with an attendant focus on the burden placed on society in caring for autistic individuals. Caring for autistic individuals {{has been compared to}} treating a patient with cancer, though extended over the duration of a normal lifespan. Autistic children have also been described as being held hostage to a psychiatric disorder. [...] Others have used the term [...] "mad child disease" [...] to describe autism, which some autistic individuals and their parents have found highly offensive. Margaret Somerville, founding director of the McGill Centre for Medicine, Ethics and Law, said that with activism there is a direct goal and it is sometimes necessary to sacrifice complexity and nuance to make a point, but some autistic activists don't believe desperation justifies the rhetoric. Bennett L. Leventhal said he understands concern about comparing autistic children to hostages but thinks the campaigns <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> these are real diseases that will consume children if untreated. Autistic rights activists also reject terming the reported increase in autism diagnoses as an 'epidemic' since the word implies autism is a disease.|$|E
2500|$|... and so {{declines to}} delve very far into that topic. Dawkins {{declares}} {{that there was}} no first person, to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> evolutionary biologists use the term species to demark differences in gene composition— over often thousands of generations of separation— rather than from any one generation to the next. To illustrate this he undertakes a thought-experiment involving family photographs. If, hypothetically, there existed a complete set of photographs of all one's direct male ancestors arranged in order of birth date (or hatch date) from youngest to oldest stretching back millions of generations, {{from one generation to the}} next one would not perceive much difference between any two adjacent pictures—looking at a picture of one's grandfather or great-grandfather one is looking at a picture of a human—but if one looked at a picture from 185 million generations back one would see an image of some kind of fish-like animal. Dawkins stresses this point by saying the offspring of any sexually reproducing life form belongs in almost all cases to the same species as do its parents, with the exception of unviable hybrids such as mules.|$|E
2500|$|Literary critics such as David Schalkwyk {{see this}} sonnet as playing out a {{relationship}} with unequal power. He sees this relationship in Sonnets 26, 57, 58 and notes that it is strongest in 57 saying [...] "This sonnet's hyperbolic reference to slavery invokes more clearly the late-sixteenth-century, almost wholly pejorative sense of vassalage...". With the first lines of the sonnet being, [...] "Being your slave what should I do but tend Upon the hours, and times of your desire?" [...] it clearly correlates back to Schalkwyk's idea that Shakespeare seemingly emphasises a class difference {{or at the very}} least a power difference between Shakespeare and the Fair Youth that the sonnet addresses. Schalkwyk goes on to say [...] "This declaration of abject powerlessness (i.e. aforementioned slavery) pushes the notion of vassalage away from that of feudal reciprocity toward a commonplace early modern conception of the servant as utterly, submissive, silent and undemanding". Schalkwyk seems to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> during this period servitude was not viewed then as we view it today, but as something quietly accepted, linking to Shakespeare's [...] "servitude" [...] to the Fair Youth as something he is not resentful of, simply accepting the fact that as the speaker his rank in society was less than the addressee and that his position as a [...] "servant" [...] or [...] "slave" [...] to the Fair Youth was nothing more than a simple fact.|$|E
