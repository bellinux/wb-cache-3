40|$|Data on 202 {{records of}} Nili-Ravi buffalo heifers kept at the Livestock Experiment Station Bahadarnagar, Okara, Pakistan {{for the period}} 1994 to 2003, were {{analyzed}} to study the genetic and phenotypic correlations among four traits including age <b>at</b> <b>maturity,</b> weight <b>at</b> <b>maturity,</b> age <b>at</b> first conception and weight at first conception. The overall means (± SE) for ages <b>at</b> <b>maturity</b> and first conception were 1166 ± 15. 60 and 1311 ± 18. 42 days, respectively. The corresponding values for weights were 403 ± 4. 58 and 439 ± 4. 17 kg.

50|$|Reproduction in {{the marine}} iguana begins during the cold and dry season, with {{breeding}} from December to March and nesting from January to April. The exact timing depends on the island. Female marine iguanas reach sexual <b>maturity</b> <b>at</b> the age of 3-5 years, while males reach sexual <b>maturity</b> <b>at</b> the age of 6-8 years. Sexual maturity is marked by the first steep and abrupt decline in bone growth cycle thickness.|$|R

50|$|A {{series of}} biotic and abiotic cues, such as {{individual}} genetics, foraging quantity and quality, or population density, may trigger the maturation of the reproductive organs {{and the production}} of gametes and thus determine sexual maturity.

Observational studies in Belize have shown that although courtship occurs in pairs, the species is a group spawner, congregating in large balls of around 300 fish, with spawning occurring mostly before sunset. Juveniles live near {{the surface of the}} ocean, often hiding amongst large mats of jellyfish or Sargassum weed, with a coloration that camouflages the fish in the weed. These young fish are often moved long distances by the Gulf Stream, and this is probably the process responsible for fish found as far north as Massachusetts.|$|R
