Also they were asked {{if they were going to}} do the second leg of The Mighty Death Pop! Tour, and they said that they will go on tour in 2014 but it won't be called The Mighty Death Pop! Tour. During an interview in March 2014 DJ Paul of Da Mafia 6ix announced that they will be doing a collaboration album with Insane Clown Posse, and will tour to promote the album. In June 2014 Psychopathic Records announced that Insane Clown Posse and Da Mafia 6ix were working on a collaboration album, and Insane Clown Posse posted pictures on their official instagram page of them and Da Mafia 6ix sitting around in Violent J's home studio. The album is scheduled to be released sometime in August 2014. A few days after Faygoluvers.net conducted the interview with Insane Clown Posse, Psychopathic Records, Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid and Blaze Ya Dead Homie released a picture of the Dark Lotus hand sign stating that all original members (Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid & Blaze Ya Dead Homie) were going to be back in the studio recording a new studio album on all their media outlets. Under the hand sign were Roman numerals translating to (7-29-2014). The album will initially be released at the 2014 GOTJ (7/23/2014 - 7/27/2014). In June 2014 Insane Clown Posse announced that they will be releasing their first box set The First Six with all first six Joker Cards (Carnival of Carnage, Ringmaster, Riddle Box, The Great Milenko, The Amazing Jeckel Brothers, /), along with a certification of authenticity signed by Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope, 6 tarot cards, and an 8-song EP of all new music titled House of Wax, that will be released on October 28, 2014. In a July 6, 2014 interview Faygoluvers.net conducted with Jumpsteady, he stated that Psychopathic is currently working with some new supergroups. At the 2014 GOTJ during Anybody Killa's seminar, it was announced that he and Big Hoodoo have created a new group called The Have Nots. Insane Clown Posse have composed a group with Da Mafia 6ix called The Killjoy Club, and will be releasing their debut album titled Reindeer Games on September 2, 2014. ICP, DM6, Madchild, Jelly Roll and <b>Mushroom</b> <b>Head</b> plus others are to go on tour possibly titled [...] "ShockFest" [...] which will run from September 18, 2014 - October 31, 2014. ICP finally announced that they will release a Psypher featuring artists that are not signed to Psychopathic Records sometime before Hallowicked, including Madchild. Also announced Otis of AMB and DJ Paul will both release solo albums on Psychopathic records in 2015. On August 5, 2014 ICP released a promo flyer for their upcoming tour titled [...] "ShockFest" [...] with Da Mafia 6ix, Mushroomhead, Madchild and Jelly Roll from September 30, 2014 through October 31, 2014. The tour was originally scheduled to be a 45-date tour, and scheduled to kick off on September 18, 2014, but due to Madchild performing in Australia with his group Swollen Members for a mini tour until September 27, 2014, the tour will now kick off on September 30, 2014 Columbus, Ohio, and will conclude on ICP's 21st annual Hallowicked concert on October 31, 2014, in Detroit, Michigan. Psychopathic Records released a video promo for [...] "ShockFest" [...] in early August 2014. The tour is now scheduled to run from September 25, 2014, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and will conclude on October 31, 2014, in Detroit, Michigan. In the booklet released with the Reindeer Games album were four flyers in promotion of new albums. The first was for Insane Clown Posse, it said that the 3rd Joker Card in the 2nd Deck will be released [...] "sooner than you think". The second was for Otis, it said that his debut solo album on Psychopathic will be titled Slaughter and it said that it too will be released [...] "soon". The third was for DJ Paul, it said that his debut solo album on Psychopathic will be titled Master Of Evil and it said that it too will be released [...] "soon". The fourth was for Da Mafia 6ix, it was for their upcoming album titled [...] "Watch What U Wish" [...] which will be released on October 31, 2014, not on Psychopathic Records. In early October 2014 it was announced that [...] "Watch What U Wish" [...] will be pushed back to a 2015 release creating speculation that Psychopathic will release the album. Instead DM6 will release a mixxtape titled Hear Some Evil in October 2014. The First Six was initially scheduled to be released on October 28, 2014, but after a minor setback it is now scheduled to be released on November 25, 2014. At the 2014 20th Hallowicked Anniversary, ICP revealed the 3rd Joker Card in the 2nd Deck which is broken up into two parts, [...] which will be released on Violent J's 43rd bday, April 28, 2015, and [...] will be released July 28, 2014. On December 6, 2014, at the show in Topeka, Kansas, Tha Hav Knots a group composed of Anybody Killa and Big Hoodoo released their first-ever debut track titled [...] "Happy Wicked Holiday", a Christmas-themed single. During ABK's set during the tour they opened with their first official song titled [...] "Don't Stop", no studio version of the song has been released, and ended with [...] "Happy Wicked Holiday".|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{vertical}} and horizontal distances between dual fish-like foils on the propulsive characteristics of the biomimetic propulsor system is investigated by using an unsteady panel method. The present method is validated by comparing computed results with other numerical and experimental data. The mutual vortex-vortex interaction between the shed vortices from both foils {{has the effect of}} changing the pointing direction of <b>mushroom</b> <b>heads.</b> The leading foil’s propulsive characteristics do not change much with the vertical distance between the foils, whereas the following foil’s propulsive characteristics are changed significantly depending on the vertical and horizontal distances between the foils. The overall wake patterns depend mainly on the horizontal distance. The intensity of the mutual interaction between the wake vortices depends on the vertical distance. Thus, the propulsive characteristics of the dual fish-like foils are complicated functions of the vertical and horizontal distances between the foils. The present method has the limitation of potential-low assumption. If the flow separation near {{the leading edge of the}} foils is not significant, the present method can be applied to the design of biomimetic propulsors...|$|R
50|$|Red pushbuttons {{can also}} have large <b>heads</b> (called <b>mushroom</b> <b>heads)</b> for easy {{operation}} and to facilitate the stopping of a machine.

Typically this light is included {{into the center of the}} pushbutton and a lens replaces the pushbutton hard center disk. The source of the energy to illuminate the light is not directly tied to the contacts on the back of the pushbutton but to the action the pushbutton controls. In this way a start button when pushed will cause the process or machine operation to be started and a secondary contact designed into the operation or process will close to turn on the pilot light and signify the action of pushing the button caused the resultant process or action to start.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The East Carpathians Bend {{area has}} a very complex {{structure}} character-ized {{by the presence of}} nappes, their post-tectonic cover and salt diapirs. The salt forming the studied diapirs s Early Miocene (Burdigalian) in age. After its accu-mulation the salt was more or less continuously involved in alternating extensional and compressional stages that deformed it from its original tabular position to the present-day diapir. Five stages of salt deformation have been established: initial, pre-nappe mplacement, appe emplacement, post-nappe emplacement and Wal-lachian. During all of these stages the salt was configured into different shapes: it formed a truncated cone during the initial stage, a <b>mushroom</b> <b>head</b> during the pre-nappe emplacement stage, and an increasingly more tapered shape with nappe emplacement and during the post-nappe mplacement s ages. Finally, it was squeezed out and refashioned by strike-slip faulting during the Wallachian com-pressional stage of Pleistocene age. In the East Carpathians Bend area the numerous alt exposures as well as salt-water springs reveal the presence of subsurface salt bodies. Historically, the salt has been o...|$|E

In this type of plume, entrainment assists the reaction, producing new buoyancy which fuels an accelerating plume head.
