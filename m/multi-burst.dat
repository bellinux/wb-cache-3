40|$|The {{conventional}} ℓ 2 <b>multi-burst</b> (MB) channel estimation {{can achieve}} the Cramer-Rao bound asymptotically {{by using the}} subspace projection. However, the ℓ 2 MB technique suffers from the noise enhancement problem if the training sequences (TSs) are not ideally uncorrelated. We clarify {{that the problem is}} caused by an inaccurate noise whitening process. The ℓ 1 regularized MB channel estimation can, however, improve the problem by a channel impulse response length constraint. Asymptotic performance analysis shows that the ℓ 1 MB can improve channel estimation performance significantly over the ℓ 2 MB technique in a massive multiple-input multiple-output system when the TSs are not long enough and not ideally uncorrelated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—DVB-SH {{is a new}} {{broadcasting}} standard {{offering a}} mobile TV service for handheld devices using hybrid satellite/terrestrial-repeaters solution. A new link layer protection algorithm called <b>Multi-Burst</b> Sliding Encoding (MBSE) has been recently adopted {{to cope with the}} long fading time introduced by the direct satellite link. This paper presents a method to optimize the MBSE parameters and an analysis of the performance gain. Various sets of parameters are studied and optimized with respect to the link performance. Furthemore, an algorithm was provided to compute the optimum values of the MBSE parameters according to some constraints. we have implemented MBSE in two UDcast DVB-SH equipements and we have validated our optimization method using intensive experiments with typical usage scenarios under a hardware-emulated wireless link.

40|$|We have {{collected}} archival data on NGC 7673 to constrain the star-formation history {{that produced the}} young star clusters and the field stellar population in this galaxy during the last 2 Gyr. We have considered the sample of 50 star clusters detected by HST/WFPC 2 in the UV, V and I bands and estimated their age, intrinsic reddening, and mass via comparison of their colours with STARBURST 99 models. We have found two prominent epochs of cluster formation occurred about 20 Myr and 2 Myr ago, with somewhat minor events between 3 Myr and 6 Myr ago. The star clusters are characterised by an intrinsic reddening E(B-V) < 0. 4 mag and a mass lower than 2 e+ 06 solar masses. Out of the 50 star clusters, we have selected 31 located {{within the boundaries of}} the IUE large slit that was employed to obtain the spectrum of NGC 7673 between 1150 Ang. and 3350 Ang. For each cluster, we have built a synthetic spectrum corresponding to the age, mass and intrinsic reddening derived from the cluster colours, properly redshifted to NGC 7673. The spectra have then been added together in a final, clusters integrated spectrum. This and the IUE and FUSE spectra of NGC 7673 have allowed us to describe the star-formation history of the unresolved stars in the field as either exponentially decaying or <b>multi-burst.</b> In the first case, we have derived an e-folding time of 700 (900) Myr and an initial star-formation rate of 16 (13) solar masses per year when the Fitzpatrick's (Calzetti's) extinction law is used. In the case of a <b>multi-burst</b> star-formation history, the field population turns out to be composed by a young (< 40 Myr) component 3 (2) times brighter than the star clusters, and a component as old as 850 (450) Myr, about 200 (100) times more massive than the star clusters together.

30|$|While several {{works have}} {{addressed}} {{the analysis of the}} QoS gain achieved by adoption of AL-FEC, very few contributions concern the gain on QoE. In particular, in [3], the authors analyze the reduction of the wireless packet loss by the integration of different techniques including FEC. In [4], an AL-FEC scheme able to deal with packet loss during real-time delivering of High Definition Video (HDV) over IP networks is presented. The performed experimental tests show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of protection of real-time HDV data and Quality of Service requirements. The QoS gain that can be obtained by applying <b>multi-burst</b> forward error correction for DVB-H streaming services with AL-FEC with respect to the conventional approach with MPE-FEC, based on a burst by burst protection, is reported in [5]. In [6], an algorithm for the optimization of 1 D-FEC for maximizing the QoE for IP video telephony as modeled by the ITU-T R G. 1070 standard is considered.|$|E
40|$|The low-frequency {{components}} of the near-field ground motions produced by surface explosions are investigated and evidence is presented which suggests that much of this motion can {{be accounted for by}} the Rayleigh waves induced by the airblast loading acting on the surface exterior to the region of strong nonlinear response (i. e., the crater). Scaling laws are derived for this component of the motion which indicate that the amplitude of the Rayleigh wave source function is expected to be directly proportional to yield and independent of site geology at low frequencies and to scale as yield to the one-third power and increase with the near-surface shear wave velocity at high frequencies. Finally, an unusual arrival recorded interior to a hexagonal array of surface explosions is analyzed and shown to be consistent with Rayieigh waves converging on the center from an exterior, axisymmetric, surface-ring load which may correlate physically with the <b>multi-burst</b> spall closure for this event...|$|E
40|$|The Internet Routing Project, {{referred}} to in this report as the 'Highball Project', has been investigating architectures suitable for networks spanning large geographic areas and capable of very high data rates. The Highball network architecture {{is based on a}} high speed crossbar switch and an adaptive, distributed, TDMA scheduling algorithm. The scheduling algorithm controls the instantaneous configuration and swell time of the switch, one of which is attached to each node. In order to send a single burst or a <b>multi-burst</b> packet, a reservation request is sent to all nodes. The scheduling algorithm then configures the switches immediately prior to the arrival of each burst, so it can be relayed immediately without requiring local storage. Reservations and housekeeping information are sent using a special broadcast-spanning-tree schedule. Progress to date in the Highball Project includes the design and testing of a suite of scheduling algorithms, construction of software reservation/scheduling simulators, and construction of a strawman hardware and software implementation. A prototype switch controller and timestamp generator have been completed and are in test. Detailed documentation on the algorithms, protocols and experiments conducted are given in various reports and papers published. Abstracts of this literature are included in the bibliography {{at the end of this}} report, which serves as an extended executive summary...|$|E
40|$|Ultrashort {{laser pulse}} (USLP) {{ablation}} {{has been investigated}} over a decade long. The machining quality, however, as well as ablation efficiency {{and understanding of the}} ablation mechanism, still need improvement. ^ First, a combined molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) method is used to investigate the particle transport and energy transport phenomena in USLP ablation. It is found that the ionization and ballistic electron motion greatly affect the surface material temperature. It is also found that the hydrodynamic motion and fast density change of the ablated material cannot be neglected and should be considered in the model. ^ Next, the MD-MC model is coupled with a particle-in-cell (PIC) method as well as a beam propagation method (BPM) to be an integrated atomistic model for the simulation of charged particle evolution and air breakdown. A series of shadowgraph measurements are performed to validate the simulation results in terms of early-stage plasma front locations. It is found that the location of the focal spot, whether slightly above the target surface or slightly below the target, has substantial effects on the early-stage plasma evolution. ^ To simulate later-stage plume plasma evolution, the output of this integrated atomistic model is used as the input to a hydrodynamic model. Various plasma properties, such as the plasma expansion length, temperature and electron number density, are obtained from this simulation model and validated against direct fluorescence photography and plasma emission spectroscopy measurements. The nonlinear relationship between ablation depth and laser fluence is found to directly relate to the relationship between plasma temperature and laser fluence. The nonlinear relationships are caused by the effect of early-stage plasma and air breakdown. ^ The effect of air breakdown on laser energy loss is further investigated with focal lenses of various focal lengths using the proposed simulation model. It is found that the laser energy loss increases as the focal length decreases. ^ A 10 -picosecond (ps) laser is used for microhole drilling and microstructure machining on metals, alloys, and ceramics. It is demonstrated that ps laser has the capability of producing high-quality features comparable to femtosecond (fs) lasers and good stability as well as flexibility, which meet the requirements of precision applications in industry. The ablation depth per pulse is investigated via experiments and simulations. Two-temperature model (TTM) is used for single-pulse mode and further expanded for <b>multi-burst</b> mode laser ablation simulation. It is found that, at a fixed laser pulse energy, the ablation depth per pulse greatly depends on the pulse-to-pulse separation time in <b>multi-burst</b> mode but does not change much in single-pulse mode. The energy accumulation between two adjacent pulses in a burst enhances the ablation efficiency. ...|$|E
40|$|Ocean {{waves are}} {{composed}} {{of a number of}} waves with different wave heights, periods, frequencies, and directions. This sea state is mainly analyzed by two approaches. One is by spectral analysis, and the other by individual wave analysis. In spectral analysis, it is assumed that the sea is composed of a variety of sinu-soidal waves with different amplitudes, frequencies, and directions. Therefore, each wave component can be linearly superimposed to generate the original sea state. On the other hand, individual wave analysis distinguishes and identifies each wave, then calculates the wave height and period of each wave passing through a fixed wave station. Therefore, individual wave analysis is more convenient to study the break-ing wave mechanism and related cross-shore sediment transport in the surf zone. This report describes only analysis procedures and algorithms {{that can be used to}} determine individual-wave properties of a train of waves with respect to statistics. Thus, the develop-ment of a spectral analysis package is left for future study. The analysis concerns properties such as wave height, wave period, water surface elevation, extreme wave properties, joint distribution of height and pe-riod. In addition, this program is simple to extend to the analysis of a <b>multi-burst</b> wave record, but it is expected that when using the computer program, engi-neers will take responsibility themselves for the list-ings. ...|$|E
40|$|Asynchronous {{controllers}} specification used in heterogeneous (synchronous+asynchronous) systems rely on {{two types}} of signals: level sensitive signals (LSS) that are used as conditionals and transition sensitive signals (TSS). However several applications may contain signals that change from one type to the other during the controller’s operation. We call such signals as “ 4 phase signals”. Two previous publications showed how to handle these signals. One captures the signals using a generalized signal transition graph and then transforms it into a state graph. They target the I/O mode of operation. It is known {{that the use of}} state graphs limits the use of this method to small examples. That is not the case when non-monotonic LSS signals are present. A more recent work proposed to capture such 4 PS signals {{as an extension of the}} extended burst-mode (XBM). The authors showed that the XBM 2 PLA tool was able to describe and synthesize a small application containing a 4 PS signal. In this work we show that there are three different cases to be considered when a 4 PS signal is present in a burst-mode specification. They depend on the dynamic behavior of the signal during the controller operation. The results obtained when using the flexible Miriã synthesis tool starting from a flexible <b>multi-burst</b> graph specification for all three cases were superior to all previously reported studies.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to address individual differences in aided speech understanding among a relatively large group of older adults. The group of older adults consisted of 98 adults (50 female and 48 male) ranging in age from 60 to 86 (mean = 69. 2). Hearing loss was typical for this age group and about 90 % had not worn hearing aids. All subjects completed a battery of tests, including cognitive (6 measures), psychophysical (17 measures), and speech-understanding (9 measures), as well as the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing (SSQ) self-report scale. Most of the speech-understanding measures made use of competing speech and the non-speech psychophysical measures were designed to tap phenomena thought to be relevant for the perception of speech in competing speech (e. g., stream segregation, modulation-detection interference). All measures of speech understanding were administered with spectral shaping applied to the speech stimuli to fully restore audibility through at least 4000 Hz. The measures used were demonstrated to be reliable in older adults and, when compared to a reference group of 28 young normal-hearing adults, age-group differences were observed on many of the measures. Principal-components factor analysis was applied successfully {{to reduce the number of}} independent and dependent (speech understanding) measures for a multiple-regression analysis. Doing so yielded one global cognitive-processing factor and five non-speech psychoacoustic factors (hearing loss, dichotic signal detection, <b>multi-burst</b> masking, stream segregation, and modulation detection) as potential predictors. To this set of six potential predictor variables were added subject age, Environmental Sound Identification (ESI), and performance on the text-recognition-threshold (TRT) task (a visual analog of interrupted speech recognition). These variables were used to successfully predict one global aided speech-understanding factor, accounting for about 60 % of the variance...|$|E
40|$|Since image {{processing}} {{aimed at reducing}} image noise can also remove important texture, standard methods for evaluating the capture and retention of image texture are currently being developed. Concurrently, {{the evolution of the}} intelligence and performance of camera noise-reduction (NR) algorithms poses a challenge for these protocols. Many NR algorithms are ‘content-aware’, which can lead to different levels of NR being applied to various regions within the same digital image. We review the requirements for improved texture measurement. The challenge is to evaluate image signal (texture) content without having a test signal interfere with the processing of the natural scene. We describe an approach to texture reproduction analysis that uses embedded periodic test signals within image texture regions. We describe a target that uses natural image texture combined with a multi-frequency periodic signal. This low-amplitude signal region is embedded in the texture image. Two approaches for embedding periodic test signals in image texture are described. The stacked sine-wave method uses a single combined, or stacked, region with several frequency-components. The second method uses a low-amplitude version of the IEC- 61146 - 1 sine-wave <b>multi-burst</b> chart, combined with image texture. A 3 x 3 grid of smaller regions, each with a single frequency, constitutes the test target. Both methods were evaluated using a simulated digital camera capture-path that included detector noise and optical MTF, for a range of camera exposure/ISO settings. Two types of image texture were used with the method, natural grass and a computed ‘dead-leaves ’ region composed of random circles. The embedded-signal methods tested for accuracy with respect to image noise over a wide range of levels, and then further in an evaluation of an adaptive noise-reduction {{image processing}}...|$|E
