5|$|A CNN film crew, {{who were}} there on a routine check for a {{possible}} Falun Gong protest, observed a <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> down on the pavement northeast of the Monument to the People's Heroes at {{the centre of the}} square. He proceeded to pour gasoline over himself and set himself ablaze. Police officers quickly congregated on the scene and extinguished the flames. Shortly afterwards, another four people on the square set themselves alight. One of the four, a man, was detained and driven away in a police van.|$|E
5|$|Clark left Cambridge {{at the age}} of 18 to {{join the}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as an officer. During initial {{training}} at HMS Collingwood, near Portsmouth, Clark discovered that he was colour blind and only passed the medical examination by persuading the <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> behind him to whisper the answers to him. Clark served aboard HMS Fleetwood on convoy escort operations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean before attending HMS King Alfred at Hove. Whilst there his colour blindness was discovered and he was banned from seagoing postings.|$|E
5|$|The album's cover was, like {{several other}} Pink Floyd albums, {{designed}} by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. It {{consists of a}} photograph of a <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> in a tree which has been taken out of focus to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector, and liked the visual effect when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did not want to make the cover particularly good as The Dark Side of the Moon would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it was given proper consideration like any other Floyd album.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde Spears sitting and {{laughing}} in a bar with two female friends, but stops {{to look at a}} brunette Spears calling out to her on a small stage in front of them, wearing a leather vest, a studded belt, panties and fishnet stockings while sporting a tattoo on her biceps. She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her as the camera moves slightly in and out of focus to the beat of the song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E
25|$|The {{cover was}} done by Dave McMacken as {{somewhat}} in vein of Salvador Dalí's surreal imagery depicting a two-headed <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> on a waterbed in a Holiday Inn hotel room surrounded by various objects like a Mothers backstage pass and a television set showing Zappa's face with slime oozing out of it. The entire painting is depicted in a frame showing many sexual acts.|$|E

Two of the stamps include portions of an illustration of a nude <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> between the legs of another man dressed as a police officer; the other depicts nude buttocks with a man's face included between the thighs. The stamp set exceeded Posti's expectations, with pre-orders from 178 countries, making it the best-selling stamp set in the service's history.|$|E
25|$|The {{conception}} of symmetry is {{explained in the}} following way: One imagines a <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> in the paryanka posture, i.e. crossing the legs and placing the hands over the navel. If one imagines that the two knees are joined by a line, and from the right shoulder to the left knee, and from the left shoulder to the right knee, and from the forehead to the hands, a straight line is drawn, one gets four lines. If these are equal to one another, symmetry is apparent; {{if they are not}} so, one of the other 5 samsthanas results. Gods have only the first symmetry, infernal beings and jivas who have been produced through coagulation only the 6th figure; in the case of animals and men (also of kevalins) all six samsthanas are to be found.|$|E
25|$|The 7th Cavalry, Custer commanding, {{departed}} from Fort Abraham Lincoln on May 17, 1876, {{part of a}} larger army force planning to round up remaining free Indians. Meanwhile, {{in the spring and summer}} of 1876, the Hunkpapa Lakota holy <b>man</b> <b>Sitting</b> Bull had called together the largest ever gathering of Plains Indians at Ash Creek, Montana (later moved to the Little Bighorn River) to discuss what to do about the whites. It was this united encampment of Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho Indians that the 7th met at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in the Crow Indian Reservation created in old Crow Country. (In the Fort Laramie Treaty (1851), the valley of the Little Bighorn is in the heart of the Crow Indian treaty territory and accepted as such by the Lakota, the Cheyenne and the Arapaho). The Lakotas were staying in the valley without consent from the Crow tribe, which sided with the Army to expel the Indian invaders.|$|E

25|$|Man with a Pipe is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 93.7 × 65.4cm (36.5 by 25.75 inches), signed JMetzinger lower right. The work represents a <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> {{at a table}} upon which is placed a mug of beer. The man, an American according to {{the title of the}} work, has his arms crossed and has a pipe in his mouth. He wears a jacket and tie. To the right is a vase with a painting of a sail boat in front of a setting sun above. To the sitters left can be seen half of a portrait in a round frame. While the Man with a Pipe is treated in an extreme form of Cubism, the two works hanging on the wall behind the sitter are not Cubist at all, albeit, they are stylized. One represents a boat with a setting or rising sun, the other, a portrait placed in a semi-circle, almost an echo of the Man with a Pipe.|$|E

500|$|The {{nightingale}} described {{within the}} poem experiences {{a type of}} death but does not actually die. Instead, the songbird is capable of living through its song, which is a fate that humans cannot expect. The poem ends with an acceptance that pleasure cannot last and that death is an inevitable part of life. In the poem, Keats imagines {{the loss of the}} physical world and sees himself deadas a [...] "sod" [...] over which the nightingale sings. The contrast between the immortal nightingale and mortal <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> in his garden, is made all the more acute by an effort of the imagination. The presence of weather is noticeable in the poem, as spring came early in 1819, bringing nightingales all over the heath.|$|E
500|$|Personal {{possession}} of obscene {{material in the}} home may not be prohibited by law. In Stanley v.

[...] However, it is constitutionally permissible {{for the government to}} prevent the mailing or sale of obscene items, though they may be viewed only in private. Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (2002) further upheld these rights by invalidating the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, holding that, because the act [...] "rohibit child pornography that does not depict an actual child" [...] it was overly broad and unconstitutional under the First Amendment and that: ...|$|E

500|$|Fishing reel: In {{literary}} records, {{the earliest}} {{evidence of the}} fishing reel comes from a 4th-century AD work entitled Lives of Famous Immortals. The earliest known depiction of a fishing reel comes from a Southern Song (1127–1279) painting done in 1195 by Song dynasty painter Ma Yuan (c. 1160–1225) called [...] "Angler on a Wintry Lake," [...] showing a <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> on a small sampan boat while casting out his fishing line. Another fishing reel was featured in a painting by the Yuan dynasty painter Wu Zhen (1280–1354). The book Tianzhu lingqian (Holy Lections from Indian Sources), printed between 1208 and 1224, features two different woodblock print illustrations of fishing reels being used. An Armenian parchment Gospel of the 13th century shows a reel (though not as clearly depicted as the Chinese ones). The Sancai Tuhui, a Chinese encyclopedia published in 1609, features the next known picture of a fishing reel and vividly shows the windlass pulley of the device. These five pictures mentioned {{are the only ones}} which feature fishing reels before the year 1651 (when the first English illustration was made); after that year they became commonly depicted in world art.|$|E
500|$|With {{this theme}} of {{a loss of}} {{pleasure}} and inevitable death, the poem, according to Claude Finney, describes [...] "the inadequacy of the romantic escape {{from the world of}} reality to the world of ideal beauty". Earl Wasserman essentially agrees with Finney, but he extended his summation of the poem to incorporate the themes of Keats's Mansion of Many Apartments when he says, [...] "the core of the poem is the search for the mystery, the unsuccessful quest for light within its darkness" [...] and this [...] "leads only to an increasing darkness, or a growing recognition of how impenetrable the mystery is to mortals." [...] With these views in mind, the poem recalls Keats's earlier view of pleasure and an optimistic view of poetry found within his earlier poems, especially Sleep and Poetry, and rejects them. This loss of pleasure and incorporation of death imagery lends the poem a dark air, which connects [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] with Keats' other poems that discuss the demonic nature of poetic imagination, including Lamia. In the poem, Keats imagines the loss of the physical world and sees himself dead—he uses an abrupt, almost brutal word for it—as a [...] "sod" [...] over which the nightingale sings. [...] The contrast between the immortal nightingale and mortal <b>man,</b> <b>sitting</b> in his garden, is made all the more acute by an effort of the imagination.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{displays}} news anchor {{reports about the}} Earth on course {{to pass through the}} tail of a comet named Eurydice, as well as displaying a worldwide panic. The rest of the video then is presented {{through the use of a}} handheld video camera. Grande is in a Fiat car as the passenger, with her boyfriend (played by Matt Bennett), who is recording. They are stuck in traffic as they try to leave the city, implied to be Los Angeles, California. While everyone around them is panicking, Grande seems to be calm as she wants to get a closer look at the comet. Impatient, she leaves the car while Bennett tries to stop her, and then follows. They make their way through the crowds, but are stopped by the police who are barricading the street. Meanwhile, the comet erupts in the sky and begins to crash to the ground as the song starts. Grande manages to get through but Bennett is unable to, so he goes through an open ambulance and manages to catch up with her in an alleyway with stairs leading up into an apartment complex. Ariana notices the comet in the sky. The two enter a home of a frightened family and try to leave through the other door, only for the comet to crash into the building, nearly killing both of them. Frightened, the two continue on and enter a room filled with television screens of the comet and an old <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> at a desk. As the former two of them try to leave, the latter tries to stop them, but they knock him to the ground, and all the screens change to the same countdown timer. [...] Grande and Bennett eventually make their way up the rooftop after subduing the old man again, who had caught up with them. The camera is then set down, and shows the two of them embracing each other one last time until the comet crashes down, destroys everything and leads the Earth to an end.|$|E
