[...] 30 th IAS Meeting of Sedimentology, 2 - 5 September 2013, ManchesterThe Djibouti Drift is an {{elongated}} separated contourite drift {{located at the}} southwestern foot of the Djibouti Ville Seamount just at {{the outer edge of}} the Motril <b>Marginal</b> <b>Plateau</b> (northern Alboran Sea). The core Sagas K- 3 (up to 4. 60 m) was recovered at 713 m water depth from the drift deposits formed by the interaction of intermediate and deep Mediterranean water masses with the seafloor. The objective of this work is to study the sediment dynamics of these drift deposits and infer changes in bottom current intensities and fluctuations in water mass depths which could be related to climate changes in the SW Mediterranean Sea. Sedimentological and geochemical data have been used for this study. Grain-size analysis was measured for the total and carbonate-free fraction. The median (MD), sortable silt (SS, 10 - 63 μm) and silt/clay ratios (S/C) of the carbonate-free fraction were used as proxies for bottom current variability. Major elements were determined by X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF). Selected element (Ca, Fe, Ti) and Si/Si+Al, Zr/Al ratios have been used as proxies for detrital input fluctuations whereas Ca/Ca+Fe, Br/Al, and S/Al ratios are used to infer changes in marine productivity. The stratigraphy for the Sagas K 3 core is based on: i) two radiocarbon dates in the upper section of the core (10. 9 ka at 22. 5 cm and 29. 8 ka at 87. 5 cm), and ii) the correlation of the down-core Ca intensity curve with the stacked SPECMAP isotope curve. We are currently performing stable oxygen isotope analyses on Sagas K 3 to infer alternating warm and cool periods in the Alboran Sea. According to this preliminary age model, the core could span the last 300 ka back to end of glacial MIS 8, which shows low sedimentation rates for this core (1. 5 cm/ 1000 yr in average). However, this result is supported by the low sedimentation rates calculated between the two C- 14 dated samples (3. 4 cm/ 1000 yr) and those calculated on the basis of the last 450 ka (MIS 12) (2 cm/ 1000 yr) from the chronostratigraphy of high resolution seismic profiles from the Motril <b>Marginal</b> <b>Plateau.</b> This low sedimentation rate differs from the values recorded in previous work on the Alboran Sea. This can probably be attributed to the specific morpho-structural setting of the Sagas K- 3 core, {{the outer edge of the}} Motril <b>Marginal</b> <b>Plateau</b> which is an isolated area far from fluvial sediment sources, and related to a seamount. The grain size records of the bulk fraction reveal that the drift deposits are essentially poorly sorted muds (3. 5 - 5 μm MD) and poorly and moderated sorted clayey-silts (7 - 10. 5 μm MD). The down-core trend in MD of the free-carbonate fraction displays up to 10 peaks (7 - 10. 5 μm) which correlate with the higher values of SS and S/C. These peaks are related to faster flows and probably better-oxygenated deep waters as reflected by increasing values of marine productivity proxies. Thus, geochemical proxies show similar down-core trends of the grain-size parameters to concomitant high values of MD, SS and silt/clay ratio as well as high values of Ca/Ca+Fe, Si/Si+Al, Zr/Al.

40|$|A SIMPLE {{model for}} {{continental}} basement structures at rifted continental margins comprises large fault blocks which trend approximately parallel to, and step down towards, the continental–ocean boundary (for example, see ref. 1).

40|$|Transient {{storage and}} erosion of valley fills, or {{sediment}} buffering, {{is a fundamental}} but poorly quantified process that may significantly bias fluvial sediment budgets and marine archives used for paleoclimatic and tectonic reconstructions. Prolific sediment buffering is now recognized to occur within the mountainous upper Indus River headwaters and is quantified {{here for the first}} time using optically stimulated luminescence dating, petrography, detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, and morphometric analysis to define the timing, provenance, and volumes of prominent valley fills. This study finds that climatically modulated sediment buffering occurs over 10 ^ 3 – 10 ^ 4 yr time scales and results in biases in sediment compositions and volumes. Increased sediment storage coincides with strong phases of summer monsoon and winter westerlies precipitation over the late Pleistocene (32 – 25 ka) and mid-Holocene (~ 8 – 6 ka), followed by incision and erosion with monsoon weakening. Glacial erosion and periglacial frost-cracking drive sediment production, and monsoonal precipitation mediates sediment evacuation, in contrast to the arid Transhimalaya and monsoonal frontal Himalaya.

40|$|Drowned {{carbonate}} reefs on passive {{margins are}} puzzling {{because of their}} enormous growth potential compared to typical rates of passive margin subsidence and moderate sea-level fluctuations. A possible solution to this paradox is that slow processes acting over geologic time weaken reefs and contribute to their ultimate demise. The Australian northeastern <b>marginal</b> <b>plateaus,</b> known for their drowned reefs, underwent a period of accelerated tectonic subsidence during the late Miocene to Pliocene that, combined with a sequence of second-order global sea-level rises, outpaced reef growth and drowned the once-thriving Miocene carbonate platforms. However, the mechanism for the observed anomalous subsidence of this relatively mature passive margin 1000 km from the nearest plate boundary is uncertain. We use a coupled plate, kinematic mantle flow model to show that in the late Miocene northeastern Australia overrode subducted slabs from Eocene Melanesian subduction north of Papua New Guinea. We find {{that the rate of}} surface subsidence induced by the sinking slabs increases the likelihood that relative sea-level rises outpaced late Miocene reef growth. In addition to the well-known effects of long-term plate processes and short-term global sea-level and climate change, our results demonstrate that deep Earth processes can play a substantial role in driving the evolution of passive margins and coral reefs. ...|$|R

[...] 2 pagesThe Aboran Sea Basin {{is located}} in the backarc domain of the Betic-Rif orogenic belt (Gibraltar Arc) which is the western end of the Mediterranean Alpine Compressive Belt. Both, the Alboran Sea basin and the Gibraltar Arc were {{generated}} by the westward migration of the Alboran Crustal Domain and its collision with the margins of the Eurasian and Nubian (Western Africa) from the late Oligocene. The internal units of this orogen and a volcanic complex domain of Middle and Upper Miocene age constitute the basement of the basin. The Alboran region shows an intense deformation during the Pliocene and Quaternary times {{as a consequence of the}} oblique convergence between the two main plates, which is characterized by the absence of a well deﬁned plate boundary, the generation of a broad deformation area and strain partitioning as the result of the squeeze of the Alboran Domain between the main plates. These factors confer this region a signiﬁcant seismic and tectonic activity. Local seismicity shows a large number of events that have mostly low to moderate magnitudes, lower than M 5. However some places are characterized by high magnitude earthquakes in southern Iberia (Adra, M 6. 1 in 1910), or in the African margin as the Al-Hoceima region which has been recently affected by two strong seismic events separated by only 10 years (M 6. 0 in 1994 and M 6. 3 in 2004). The great variety of focal earthquake mechanisms ranging from pure thrust to strike slip and normal faulting (Stich et al., 2010) and the presence of a family of penetrative linear structures on the seaﬂoor (Ballesteros et al., 2008) is the evidence of this intense and varied active tectonics. The complex phisiography of the basin has been drived by the Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic history which is characterized by the margin basement tilting to the basin interior, and has conditioned the narrowness of the current continental shelves and the inclined slope. The basin proﬁle is broken by two wide marginal platforms, the Moulouya <b>Marginal</b> <b>Plateau</b> in the Morroccoan-Algerian margin and the Djibouti-Motril <b>Marginal</b> <b>Plateau</b> in the septentrional margin, and by a series of structural seamounts, the major of them is the Alboran Ridge uplifted during the evolution of the basin in the late Miocene-Quaternary (Martínez-García et al., 2013). The margins tilting have been related to the uplifting of the cordilleras arranged around the basin. A detailed morpho-tectonic study of the northern part of the Alboran Sea Basin has been realized by means of revisited multibeam swath bathymetric data alongside with the analysis of medium to very high resolution seismic proﬁles (singled Sparker, Airgun, TOPAS PS 18 and Atlas PARASOUND P 35). This has enabled us to deﬁne several tectonic-related seaﬂoor features and their role in the recent tectonics. The observed morpho-tectonic features correspond to: i) lineal scarps with a wide range of dimensions and following several trends,WNW-ESE, NE-SW, NNE-SSW and N-S; ii) NE-SW to NNE-SSW-oriented compressive ridges; iii) ENE-WSW to NE-SW-striking antiforms; iv) NNE-SSW-oriented lineal depressions; v) rhomb- shaped depressions; vi) lineal valleys, canyons and gullies with WNW-ESE, and N-S orientations; and vii) N-S directed dissected valleys, canyons and gullies.

It is a <b>marginal</b> <b>plateau</b> underlain by Hercynian granites and Palaeozoic sediments, which form large horsts, grabens and tilted fault blocks with a trend that is approximately parallel to the main Celtic/Armorican Shelf edge. The spur {{is thought to be}} a westward continuation of the buoyant Cornubian Ridge, and is bounded to the north and south by large fault lines which probably represent reactivation of Hercynian structural trends. The continental basement is further divided longitudinally into a low-lying outer zone (Intermediate Zone) and a high inner region (Goban Spur proper). The ocean/continent boundary is thought to lie at {{the outer edge of the}} Intermediate Zone, Sea-floor spreading anomalies immediately west of the Intermediate Zone suggest that the adjacent ocean crust was created prior to anomaly 33 (say at ca. 90 m. y. B. P.). The sedimentary sequence on Goban Spur can be subdivided into four layers which can be tentatively correlated with the stratigraphic succession on the Meriadzek Terrace (IPOD sites). Such a correlation suggests that the lowermost sediment layer (?Jurassic-Albian) represents a tectono-sedimentary rift infill, and that Layers 2 – 4 (Upper Cretaceous to Quaternary) were deposited during slow epeirogenic downwarping of the plateau and that the sedimentary processes involved both draping and strong current moulding. The relatively buoyant nature of Inner Goban Spur has inhibited the accumulation of a thick post-rifting sedimentary sequence (700 – 1000 m), and has shielded the Intermediate Zone from downslope mass movements of material. This has resulted in the accumulation of an anomalously thin post-rift stage outer margin sediment prism (ca. 1000 m) compared to most continent rises (up to 10 km) ...|$|E

An extensive range of previously undiscovered features including <b>marginal</b> <b>plateaus,</b> linear rills, ridges and gullies, canyon systems, as well as slides and slumps were identified. Gravity cores (5. 65 m and 3. 64 m long) taken in the ‘Upper Slope Slide’ (25 km 2 in area, 200 - 300 m thick), and the ‘Middle Slope Slide’ (11 km 2 in area, 100 - 150 m thick) indicate the slide scars contain drapes of Pleistocene to Recent hemipelagic mud. Shorter gravity cores (1. 33 m and 0. 43 m long) taken adjacent to both slides terminated in stiff muds of upper Pliocene to lower Pleistocene age (Upper Slope Slide), and upper Miocene to lower Pliocene age (Middle Slope Slide). This unique pattern shows that the sediment is being accumulated and protected inside the slide hollows, while being actively removed from the exposed adjacent slopes, most likely by abrasion. Biostratigraphic ages determined for the basal material demonstrate that the seafloor surfaces at both sites are effectively erosional unconformities. The basal, stiff sediments on the upper slope was deposited between 2 and 2. 5 Ma BP; this material was scoured and then buried beneath a 1 m thick sediment drape at 0. 45 Ma BP. Sediments exposed on the seafloor adjacent to the Middle Slope Slide were dated at around 6 - 8. 5 Ma BP. This indicates that the smooth upper continental slope developed its morphology by the late-mid Pleistocene, while the middle slope is a Post-Pliocene feature. It is thought that Pliocene-Pleistocene geological events including fluctuations in the intensity of surface and abyssal ocean currents are responsible for re-sculpting the continental slope’s morphology and have a) increased abrasion and erosion of the middle and upper slope; while b) suppressed sediment delivery...|$|R

The Whitsunday Silicic LIP event had widespread impact, producing both substantial extrusive volumes of dominantly silicic pyroclastic material and coeval first-cycle volcanogenic sediment that accumulated within many eastern Australian sedimentary basins, and principally in the Great Australian Basin system (> 2 Mkm 3 combined volume). The final pulse of volcanism and volcanogenic sedimentation at c. 105 - 95 Ma coincided with epicontinental seaway regression, which shows a lack of correspondence with the global sea-level curve, and alternatively records a wider, continental-scale effect of volcanism and rift tectonism. Widespread igneous underplating related to this LIP event is evident from high paleogeothermal gradients and regional hydrothermal fluid flow detectable in the shallow crust and over a broad region. Enhanced CO 2 fluxing through sedimentary basins also records indirectly, large-scale, LIP-related mafic underplating. A discrete episode of rapid crustal cooling and exhumation began c. 100 - 90 Ma {{along the length of the}} eastern Australian margin, related to an enhanced phase of continental rifting that was largely amagmatic, and probably a switch from wide-more narrow rift modes.

Three families of faults and related folds, with NE-SW, WNW-ESE and NNE-SSW to N-S have been interpreted within this geomorphological scheme. The NE-SW family corresponds to: a) major scarps in both flanks of the Alboran Ridge and b) the offshore prolongation of La Serrata Fault, and both have been considered as a set of sinistral strike-slip faults. To this family, some compressive ridges, antiforms and occasionally reverse faults have been correlated. The WNW-ESE family corresponds to a set of faulted valleys (occasionally with rhomb-shaped depressions), fault scarps and linear inflection points occurring in the northern Alboran margin and the Yusuf-Habibas corridor.

Two types of negative-relief features have been identified according to their circular or elongated morphology. Circular-like shapes match with pockmark and scour mark morphologies. The pockmarks are placed at the N and NW of the Avempace Seamount from 672 to 740 m water depth. 48 pockmarks have been described and they al 1 display V-shaped cross-section. They are 1 - 19 m high and 50 - 400 m wide and but only some show higher backscatter than the surrounding areas. The scour marks occur isolated or clustered in the surroundings of the Herradura Seamount at 750 - 900 water depth. These negative-relief features are both V- and U-shaped in cross-sections. Ushaped scour marks display flat-bottom and truncated reflectors along their walls. Elongated-like shapes match with tectonic depressions and furrows. Tectonic depressions are NNE-SSW linear features, isolated and forming groups with a rhombshape distribution, that locate at 650 - 1, 000 m water depth. The furrows are smallsized erosive ENE-WSW features 1 - 5 m high and 200 m wide, located at the NW of Avempace and Herradura seamounts from 720 to 900 m water depth. They show Ushaped cross-section running parallel the regional slope. The pockmark formation is attributed to the escape of seepage of gas and interstitial fluids from contourite sediments they affect. The Pockmark field location could be also related to normal basement faults that have favoured the upward migration of the fluid following pre-existing pathways. Scour marks are associated with the vorticity arising when bottom currents flow around a seamount. Upstream of the seamount, a turbulence are develops favouring the whirls occurrence that erode seafloor creating the scour marks. Tectonic depressions are related to the vertical displacement of a NNW-SSE strike-slip fault system and associated to seafloor rupture along the Pliocene Quaternary Faults that have affected even the most recent sediments. Additionally, they can perform as small channels that control the water flow to the SW. FurrowsPeer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|During "Meteor" Cruise 6 / 1966 in the {{northwest}} Atlantic a systematic survey of the bottom topography of the southeast Greenland continental margin was undertaken. Eighty-seven profiles transverse to the shelf edge at distances of 3 - 4 nautical miles and two longitudinal profiles parallel to the coast were carried out with the ELAC Narrow Beam Echo-Sounder giving a reliable record of even steep slopes. On {{the basis of the}} echo soundings the topography and morphology of the continental shelf and slope are evaluated. A detailed bathymetric chart and a serial profile chart were designed as working material for the morphological research. These maps along with the original echograms are morphometrically evaluated. The analysis of the sea bottom features is the basis of a subsequent morphogenetical interpretation, verified and extended by means of interpretation of magnetic data and sediment analysis (grain size, roundness, lithology). The results of the research are expressed in a geomorphological map. The primary findings can be summarized as follows: 1) The southeast Greenland shelf by its bottom topography can be clearly designated as a glacially formed area. The glacial features of the shelf can be classified into two zones nearly parallel to the coast: glacial erosion forms on the inner shelf and glacial accumulation forms on the outer shelf. The inner shelf is characterized by the rugged and hummocky topography of ice scoured plains with clear west/east slope asymmetry. On the outer shelf three types of glacial accumulation forms can be recognized: ice margin deposits with clearly expressed terminal moraines, glacial till plains and glaciomarine outwash fans. Both zones of the shelf can be subdivided into two levels of relief. The ice scoured plains, with average depths of 240 meters (m), are dissected to a maximum depth of 1060 m (Gyldenloves Trough) by trough valleys, which are the prolongations of the Greenland fjords. The banks of the outer shelf, with an average depth of 180 m, surround glacial basins with a maximum depth of 670 meters. 2) The sediments of the continental shelf can be classified as glacial due to their grain size distribution and the degree of roundness of the gravel particles. The ice margin deposits on the outer shelf can be recognized by their high percentage of gravels. On the inner shelf a rock surface is suggested, intermittently covered by glacial deposits. In the shelf troughs fine-grained sediments occur mixed with gravels. 3) Topography and sediments show that the southeast Greenland shelf was covered by an ice sheet resting on the sea floor during the Pleistocene ice-age. The large end moraines along the shelf edge probably indicate the maximum extent of the Wurm shelf ice resting on the sea floor. The breakthroughs of the end moraines in front of the glacial basins suggest that the shelf ice has floated further seaward over the increasing depths. 4) Petrographically the shelf sediments consist of gneisses, granites and basalts. While gneisses and granites occire on the nearby coast, basalt is not known to exist here. Either this material has been drifted by icebergs from the basalt province to the north or exists on the southeast Greenland shelf itself. The last interpretation is supported bythe high portion of basalt contained in the sediment samples taken and the strong magnetic anomalies probably caused by basaltic intrusions. 5) A magnetic profile allows the recognition of two magnetically differing areas which approximately coincide with the glacial erosion and accumulation zones. The inner shelf shows a strong and variable magnetic field because the glacially eroded basement forms the sea floor. The outer shelf is characterized by a weak and homogenous magnetic field, as the magnetized basement lies at greater depthy, buried by a thick cover of glacial sediments. The strong magnetic anomalies of the inner shelf are probably caused by dike swarms, similar to those observed further to the north in the Kangerdlugssuaq Fjord region. This interpretation is supported by the high basalt content of the sediment samples and the rough topography of the ice scoured plains which correlates in general with the magnetic fluctuations. The dike structures of the basement have been differentially eroded by the shelf ice. 6) The continental slope, extending from the shelf break at 313 m to a depth of 1270 m with an average slope of 11 °, is characterized by delta-shaped projections in front of the shelf basins, by <b>marginal</b> <b>plateaus,</b> ridges and hills, by canyons and slumping features. The projections could be identified as glaciomarine sediment fans. This conclusion is supported by the strong decrease of magnetic field intensity. The deep sea hills and ridges with their greater magnetic intensities have to be regarded as basement outcrops projecting through the glaciomarine sediment cover. The upper continental rise, sloping seaward at about 2 °, is composed of wide sediment fans and slump material. A marginal depression on the continental rise running parallel to the shelf edge has been identified. In this depression bottom currents capable of erosion have been recorded. South of Cape Farvel the depression extends to the accumulation zone of the "Eirik" sedimentary ridge. 7) By means of a study of the recent marine processes, postglacial modification of the ice-formed relief can be postulated. The retention effect of the fjord troughs and the high velocity of the East Greenland stream prevents the glacial features from being buried by sediments. Bottom currents capable of active erosion have only been found in the marginal depression on the continental rise. In addition, {{at the time of the}} lowest glacio-eustatic sea level, the shelf bottom was not situated in the zone of wave erosion. Only on the continental slope and rise bottom currents, sediment slumps and turbidity currents have led to significant recent modifications. Considering these results, the geomorphological development of the southeast Greenland continental terrace can be suggested as follows: 1. initial formation of a "peneplain", 2. fluvial incision, 3. submergence, and finally 4. glacial modification...|$|R
40|$|Dairy cow milk yield, protein yield (MPY) {{and content}} (MPC), were {{predicted}} {{in response to}} the supplies of netenergy of lactation (NEL), metabolisable protein (PDI) using curvilinear plateau equations. These responses were combined to marginal responses to Lys and Met Digestible in the Intestine (LysDI and MetDI in % PDI). The responses to NEL and PDI were estimated in a dataset with LysDI on average at 6. 7 % PDI and MetDI at 1. 9 % PDI. The curvilinear <b>plateau</b> <b>marginal</b> responses of MPC (dMPC) and MPY (dMPY) to LysDI variations around 6. 7 % PDI were established on 30 experiments (exp) in which NEL, PDI and MetDI did not vary and on 87 treatments (treat). Similarly, the responses to MetDI variations around 1. 9 % PDI were established on 21 exp and 63 treat. If LysDI = 7 % or MetDI = 2. 4 % of PDI, 95 % of their respective dMPC increase was observed. The best model to predict the dMPC response to combined effects of LysDI and MetDI (RMSE: 0. 43 g/kg) was to take the minimum between the linear part of the response to LysDI (dMPCLys = 0. 62 + 1. 75 × [LysDI – 6. 7] with LysDI< 6. 7; 26 exp and 45 treat; RMSE= 0. 59 g/kg) and the curvilinear plateau response to MetDI (1. 22 + 9. 14 × [MetDI – 1. 9] – 9. 14 × 0. 193 ×ln{ 1 =exp[(MetDI – 1. 9) / 0. 193) ]}; RMSE= 0. 58 g/kg), in accordance with the barrel concept. Neither Lys nor Met post rumen infusions modified significantly milk yield (29. 8 ± 5. 7 kg/d). The response of dMPY to both LysDI and MetDI was calculated as dMPC multiplied by milk yield estimated in response to NEL and PDI (RMSE= 23 g/d on Lys and Met post rumen infusions database). The RMSEp of dMPC and dMPY obtained using a 2 nd dataset for validation (38 exp of rumen protected Met lower and higher than 1. 9 and 89 treat) were 0. 36 g/kg and 22 g/d, respectively. If the dMPY response is added to the predicted MPY response to NEL and PDI (on a 3 rd dataset using 105 exp on rumen protected Met and on dietary Lys supplies and 218 treat) : MPYobserved = 8 (± 13) + 1 (± 0. 01) × MPYpredicted with a slope not significantly different from 1. The RMSEp (42 g/d) was twice lower than if MPY was predicted using only NEL and PDI (RMSEp= 87 g/d).
