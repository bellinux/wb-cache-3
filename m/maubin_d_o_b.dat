For a particular texture 4 - zero mass matrix, which fairly reproduces PDG CKM matrix, the range of sin 2 β is: 0. 39 - 0. 54 (1 GeV) and 0. 27 - 0. 61 (mz), for the texture 5 - zero case it is 0. 45 - 0. 54 (1 GeV) and 0. 31 - 0. 58 (mZ).

A retraction r {{is said to be}} orthogonal if for each x, x — r(x) is normal to F in a sense related to that of R. C. James. This paper establishes three main results. First, a nonexpansive projection is necessarily an orthogonal retraction; if E is smooth, the converse is also true. Second, if E is smooth then there can exist at most one nonexpan-sive projection of C onto a given subset F. Third, if E is uniformly smooth and there exists a nonexpansive retraction of C onto F, then there exists a nonexpansive projection of C onto F. The proximity mapping is a nonexpansive projection in a Hubert space, but not in a general Banach space.

40|$|International audienceSwitched Ethernet is a {{technology}} that is profoundly reshaping automotive communication architectures {{as it did in}} other application domains such as avionics with the use of AFDX backbones. Early stage timing verification of critical embedded networks typically relies on simulation and worst-case schedulability analysis. When the modeling power of schedulability analysis is not sufficient, there are typically two options: either make pessimistic assumptions or ignore what cannot be modeled. Both options are unsatisfactory because they are either inefficient in terms of resource usage or potentially unsafe. To overcome those issues, we believe it is a good practice to use simulation models, which can be more realistic, along with schedulability analysis. The two basic questions that we aim to study here is what can we expect from simulation, and how to use it properly? This empirical study explores these questions on realistic case-studies and provides methodological guidelines for the use of simulation in the design of switched Ethernet networks. A broader objective of the study is to compare the outcomes of schedulability analyses and simulation, and conclude about the scope of usability of simulation in the desi gn of critical Ethernet networks. 1 C o n t e x t a n <b>d</b> <b>o</b> <b>b</b> j e c t i v e s o f t h e s t u d y Ethernet is meant in vehicles not only for the support of infotainment applications but also to transmit time-sensitive data used for the real-time control of the vehicle and ADAS functions. In such use-cases, the temporal behavior of the communication architecture must be carefully validat ed. Early stage timing verification of critical embedded networks typically relies on simulation and worst-case schedulability analysis, which basically consists in building a mathematical model of the worst possible situations that can be encountered at run-time. When the modeling capabilities of schedulability analysis is not sufficient, which given the complexity of today's architectures is in our experience in many practical situations the case (see [Na 13,Na 14] and § 2. 4), there are typically two possibilities. The first option is to make pessimistic assumptions (e. g., modeling aperiodic frames as periodic ones), which is not always possible because for instance it may result in overloaded resources (e. g., link utilization larger than 100 %). The second option is to ignore what cannot be modeled (e. g., ignoring transmission errors, aperiodic traffic, etc). Both options are unsatisfactory because they are either inefficient in terms of resource usage or potentially unsafe. In addition, it can happen that schedulability analysis tools provide wrong results, most often because the analysis' assumptions are not met by the actual implementation, or possibly because of numerical issues in the implementation (e. g., if floating point arithmetic is used), or simply because the analysis is flawed (see for instance [Da 07]) ...|$|R

The secure <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. of the canonical Gaussian wiretap channel with no helpers is zero. It has been known that a strictly positive secure <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. can be obtained in the Gaussian wiretap channel by using a helper which sends structured cooperative signals. We show that the exact secure <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. of the Gaussian wiretap channel with a helper is 1 / 2. Our achievable scheme is based on real interference alignment and cooperative jamming, which renders the message signal and the cooperative jamming signal separable at the legitimate receiver, but aligns them perfectly at the eavesdropper preventing any reliable decoding of the message signal. Our converse is based on two key lemmas. The first lemma quantifies the secrecy penalty by showing that {{the net effect of}} an eavesdropper on the system is that it eliminates one of the independent channel inputs. The second lemma quantifies the role of a helper by developing a direct relationship between the cooperative jamming signal of a helper and the message rate. We extend this result to the case of M helpers, and show that the exact secure <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. in this case is M/(M+ 1). We then generalize this approach to more general network structures with multiple messages.

This document-deed of gift mentions {{that at the time of}} the prior Madije’s office in Zadar the fishing grounds on the islands of Molat and Dugi otok (Telašćica) were given the Monastery of St. Krševan at Zadar. For the first time an other document from the year 1056 mentions three fisherman (gripatores) by their Croatian names: Ž u p a n (S u p a n), P e t u l e t, and P <b>o</b> <b>d</b> <b>b</b> <b>o</b> j, with the addition »and their other mates«. This fact could serve also as a positive argument that the islands of the Zadar archipelago had been inhabited at that time, even though the byzantine emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus in his report »De administrando imperio« (c. 30 and 31) mentions them as uninhabited, except of the island Vrgada where the civis Romanus lived. After the Croats’ arrival at the Adriatic the conditions calmed down considerably. Inhabiting the islands more and more these conditions led them to organize economy and change their way of life. The autochthons helped the newcomers to adapt to the sea and fishing craft. As the Croats had no names in their vocabulary for individual kinds of fish and other sea fauna they t o o k o v e r those of the autochtons of formed them t h e r e using both native and foreign elements. This is also one of the reasons why the older layers of the thalassozoonomic inventory have been so well preserved. The names taken over from the tongue of the Dalmatian Romanized autochthons living in the region occupied by the Croats were adapted to the Croatian linguistic structure. Such Delmat elements, while that language had not yet died out completely, were numerous in the Zadar region where the c. Romanus prevailed teaching the Croats the crafts of seamanship and fishery. When the autochtons were already assimilated the newcomers had already a large number of fishery terminology at their disposal combined greatly with the elements taken over from them. In that sense, in forming our nomenclature our fishery terminology is constructed from a very small number of the elements brought along, while that for the more important species of ichthyofauna has been taken over directly from the Delmat Romanus and, via them, from the Greeks...|$|R

The structural response has been obtained by stochastic methods using two discretization models.

Using each of these methods the problem has been solved with several <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f., analysing the influence of the number of <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. on the results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} secure {{degrees of freedom}} (<b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f.) of one-hop {{wireless}} networks by considering four fundamental wireless network structures: 1) Gaussian wiretap channel; 2) Gaussian broadcast channel with confidential messages; 3) Gaussian interference channel with confidential messages; and 4) Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel. The secrecy capacity of the canonical Gaussian wiretap channel does not scale with the transmit power, and hence, the secure <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. of the Gaussian wiretap channel with no helpers is zero. It has been known that a strictly positive secure <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. can be obtained in the Gaussian wiretap channel by using a helper, which sends structured cooperative signals. We show that the exact secure <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. of the Gaussian wiretap channel with a helper is 1 2. Our achievable scheme is based on real interference alignment and cooperative jamming, which renders the message signal and the cooperative jamming signal separable at the legitimate receiver, but aligns them perfectly at the eavesdropper preventing any reliable decoding of the message signal. Our converse is based on two key lemmas. The first lemma quantifies the secrecy penalty by showing that {{the net effect of}} an eavesdropper on the system is that it eliminates one of the independent channel inputs. The second lemma quantifies the role of a helper by developing a direct relationship between the cooperative jamming signal of a helper and the message rate. We extend this result to the case of M helpers, and show that the exact secure <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. in this M M + 1 case is. We then generalize this approach to more general network structures with multiple messages. We show that the sum secure <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. of the Gaussian broadcast channel with confidential messages and M helpers is 1, the sum secure <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. of the twouser interference channel with confidential messages is 2 3,thesum secure <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. of the two-user interference channel with confidential messages and M helpers is 1, and the sum secure <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. of the K-user multiple access wiretap channel i...|$|R
