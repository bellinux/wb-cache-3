40|$|In {{the design}} of {{composite}} aircraft structures, joint efficiency is a key area for realising the weight-saving potential of advanced composite materials. Cost-effective, efficient design practices are necessary for optimising {{the design of}} bolted composite joints. The current state-of-the-art involves detailed three-dimensional finite element analysis. Such models {{provide detailed information on}} load distributions in multi-bolt joints, joint deformation, stress and material damage progression. However, a major drawback with such threedimensional approaches is that computer power is not yet sufficient to model large-scale composite structures which contain potentially many hundreds of bolts. To overcome this issue, a highly efficient Global Bolted Joint Model (GBJM) is presented in this thesis. Two different methods are considered as potential candidates for the GBJMa discrete method and a mesh-independent method. In the discrete method, shell finite elements are used to model the composite laminates and the bolt is represented by a combination of beam elements and rigid contact surfaces. In the mesh-independent method, a user-defined finite element is used to model the bolt and joint foundation (i. e. composite material in the direct vicinity of the bolt-hole). The user-defined finite element is calibrated using analytical approaches and these are also developed and presented. Both GBJM approaches are validated against three-dimensional finite element models and, where possible, experimental results from both single-bolt and <b>multi-bolt</b> <b>joint</b> tests. It is shown that the mesh-independent approach is the best modelling strategy for both elastic and failure analysis of both single-bolt and multi-bolt joints, with time savings in excess of 99 % achieved over three-dimensional finite element models. The method is subsequently used in a load distribution analysis of twenty-bolt joints, where each simulation ran in minutes. Employing analytical calibration methods, the GBJM can be used to represent a variety of joint configurations and loading scenarios and can hence be used in extensive parameter studies on aircraft structures. This method can potentially reduce conservatism in joint design practice, thus demonstrating its immediate industrial significance...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study is presented {{on the effects}} of bolt-hole clearance on the load distribution in <b>multi-bolt</b> composite <b>joints.</b> Single-shear, three-bolt joints were studied. The specimens were manufactured from graphite/epoxy HTA/ 6376, with quasi-isotropic lay-ups. Protruding head bolts of 8 mm diameter and torqued to finger-tight conditions were used. Different combinations of clearance were obtained by using four different reamers and a purpose-designed high-precision drilling jig. Instrumented bolts with strain gauges attached for measurement of shear strain at the shear plane, were used to measure bolt load distribution. Prior to use in the <b>multi-bolt</b> <b>joints,</b> the bolts were calibrated in single-bolt joints. For assembly of the <b>multi-bolt</b> <b>joints,</b> a special jig had to be designed to allow simultaneous aligning of the bolt along the axis of the joint, centring of each bolt in its hole, and torquing of the bolts to a prescribed level. The results of the study show that relatively small amounts of clearance can have substantial effects on load distribution. As an example, the middle bolt in a joint of this type is normally assumed to carry less load than the outer bolts, and is therefore considered not to be under threat of failure. But in the presence of clearance the load can shift to the middle bolt, potentially causing an unexpected failure mode...|$|R
40|$|Single-lap shear {{behaviour}} {{of carbon}} epoxy composite bolted aircraft fuselage joints at quasi-static and dynamic (5  m/s and 10  m/s) loading speeds is studied experimentally. Single and <b>multi-bolt</b> <b>joints</b> with countersunk fasteners were tested. The initial joint failure mode was bearing, while final failure was either due to fastener pull-through or fastener fracture at a thread. Much less hole bearing damage, and hence energy absorption, {{occurred when the}} fastener(s) fractured at a thread, which occurred most frequently in thick joints and in quasi-static tests. Fastener failure thus requires special consideration in designing crashworthy fastened composite structures; {{if it can be}} delayed, energy absorption is greater. A correlation between energy absorption in <b>multi-bolt</b> and single-bolt <b>joint</b> tests indicates potential to downsize future test programmes. Tapering a thin fuselage panel layup to a thicker layup at the countersunk hole proved highly effective in achieving satisfactory joint strength and energy absorption. ACCEPTEDpeer-reviewe...|$|R

The models were developed in the non-linear finite element code MSC/MARC. Two models are presented: one is the control case with all three holes having a ‘neat’ fit clearance between the bolt and hole, while the other has a neat fit in two holes with the third hole having a large clearance.

40|$|The {{first part}} {{includes}} {{the evaluation of}} the 10 single-bolted and the 5 multi-bolted double lap-joint test series that appeared before 2001. This identifies that the 15 test series, from 10 centres, are often different because the researchers chose different parameters to study. Of the 800 concentric strength tests 640 were single-bolted and 160 were multi-bolted. It is noteworthy that few of these previous tests include environmental conditioning of the joints. A review of design methods is given {{in this part of the}} thesis. This shows that significant joint test data is required to appraise SI design methods for PFRP bolted joints, such as presented in the EUROCOMP Design Code and Handbook of 1996 and in 1981 by Hart-Smith. The EUROCOMP simplified and rigorous methods are expected to be generic and involve damage tolerance to increase the strength of the joint design. It is further found that application of these methods requires Finite Element (FE) stress calculations for the target analysis due to bolt bearing, and for the source analysis, for <b>multi-bolted</b> <b>joints,</b> to determine the bolt load distribution and by-pass loads. Parts two and three of the contribution from the author are combinations of experimental and FE analysis work that focuses on the target and the source problems, respectively. Presented in part four is a preliminary appraisal of the EUROCOMP simplified design method and the Hart-Smith design method. The EUROCOMP method is shown to possess deficiencies, via a critique by Lancaster University, which indicates that it cannot be used in practice. By taking information from the <b>multi-bolted</b> <b>joint</b> test series in part three the author constructs semi-universal design charts using the Hart-Smith method, which can be used to design joints with changing geometry. An important finding from this preliminary appraisal is that the SI design methods are difficult to apply since they require lots of physical test data and relevant and reliable stress results from FEA.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{modelling}} and calculations of asymmetrical <b>multi-bolted</b> <b>joints</b> at the assembly stage. The physical {{model of the}} joint {{is based on a}} system composed of four subsystems, which are: a couple of joined elements, a contact layer between the elements, and a set of bolts. The contact layer is assumed as the Winkler model, which can be treated as a nonlinear or linear model. In contrast, the set of bolts are modelled using simplified beam models, known as spider bolt models. The theorem according to which nonlinearity of the contact layer has a negligible impact on the final preload of the joint in the case of its sequential tightening has been verified. Results of sample calculations for the selected multi-bolted system, in the form of diagrams of preloads in the bolts as well as normal contact pressure between the joined elements during the assembly process and at its end, are presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to model}} the {{progressive}} damage of <b>multi-bolted</b> <b>joints</b> connecting structural elements made up of FRP (fiber-reinforced polymers) composite laminates and comprising different fiber materials (namely, based on basalt, carbon and glass), as well as different stacking sequences. Differences in failure mode and ultimate-load values are numerically investigated. A numerical home-made finite element model has been conceived, implemented, and validated by means of available experimental data. The numerical model {{is based on an}} incremental displacement-based approach and on a plane-stress bi-dimensional formulation. The stress analysis has been performed by accounting for micro-structural stress-strain localization mechanisms, and describing the progressive damage process by implementing a failure criterion operating at the constituents’ scale (namely, the Huang’s criterion). Proposed results have highlighted that bolted joints based on basalt-FRP laminates and defined by a double-bolted configuration exhibited bearing failure loads comparable to those computed for glass-FRP and carbon-FRP laminates. In the case of single-bolted joints, the use of carbon-FRP laminates allowed to obtain the best mechanical properties, although joints based on basalt-FRP laminates numerically-experienced mechanical response and strength features always comparable with those of glass-FRP...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, FRP {{composites}} {{have been widely}} used for constructing entire civil structures. One of the challenging issues for building with pultruded FRP composites is understanding the behaviour of bolted joints. In this paper, the results of a numerical analysis performed on different types of bolted composite joints with different geometry and subjected to tensile loads are reported. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the distribution of shear stresses among the different bolts by varying the number of rows of bolts as well as the number of bolts per row. The study also considers the presence of variable diameter washers and their influence on the bearing stresses of composites with different fibre orientations. For verification of the validity of the analytical models, numerical results are compared to experimental results reported elsewhere. The results of this study showed that in <b>multi-bolt</b> <b>joints,</b> the load is not distributed equally due to varying bolt position, bolt-hole clearance, bolt-torque or tightening of the bolt, friction between member plates and at washer-plate interface. The results also indicated that in the presence of washers, the stress distributions in the fibre direction, varying fibre inclinations, are decreasing for each value of washer pressure...|$|R

The specimens studied were made from graphite/epoxy HTA/ 6376, with quasi-isotropic lay-ups. Protruding head bolts of 8 mm diameter and torqued to finger-tight conditions were used. The models showed excellent capability to quantify the effects of increasing clearance, which included reduced contact area and overall stiffness in the single-bolt case, and substantially changed load distribution in the multi-bolt case...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a finite element method for modeling fastener joints in aircraft structures. By using connector element in commercial software Abaqus, the finite element method can handle <b>multi-bolt</b> <b>joints</b> and secondary bending. The plates in the joints are modeled with shell elements or solid elements. First, a pre-study with linear elastic analyses is performed. The study is focused on the influence of using different connector element stiffness predicted by semi-empirical flexibility equations from the aircraft industry. The influence of using a surface coupling tool is also investigated, and proved to work well for solid models and not so well for shell models, according to a comparison with a benchmark model. Second, also in the pre-study, an elasto-plastic analysis and a damage analysis are performed. The elasto-plastic analysis is compared to experiment, but the damage analysis is not compared to any experiment. The damage analysis is only performed to gain more knowledge of the method of modeling finite element damage behavior. Finally, the best working FE method developed in the pre-study is used in an analysis of an I-beam with multi-bolt structure and compared to experiments to prove the abilities with the method. One global and one local model of the I-beam structure are used in the analysis, and with the advantage that force-displacement characteristic are taken from the experiment of the local model and assigned as a constitutive behavior to connector elements in the analysis of the global model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{progression}} of damage in carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) countersunk composite bolted joints (CBJs) with neat-fit clearance, subjected to quasi-static loading. Damage mechanisms, comprising of fibre buckling and breakage, matrix damage, shear damage and inter-laminar delamination within the CFRP composite parts of the joints have been studied. Load-displacement curves, X-ray and optical microscopic images in single- and three-bolt CBJs were used to investigate damage and deformation characteristics. The observations were then employed to further investigate the type of failure {{and the extent of}} damage. The evolution of damage within the composite parts was correlated to the failure characteristics of the joints: It was found that the type and extension of damage is strongly correlated with the ultimate failure load point of the joint in single-bolt CBJs. A combined inter/intra-laminar damage consisting of fibre cluster breakage, extensive fibre buckling, debonding and delamination was observed at the ultimate failure load. This study was then extended to three-bolt CBJ where damage surrounding each bolt and its corresponding failure load was strongly correlated: The final study showed that the ultimate failure point in single-bolt CBJ and the first-bolt-failure point in three-bolt CBJ correspond to the composite plies undergoing intra-laminar damage with the size reaching {{to the edge of the}} countersunk head. This damage developed extensively through the thickness of the composite parts underneath the countersink, and in the direction opposite to the loading direction. Outside the countersunk head, debonding and delamination were found to be the dominant damage driving mechanisms. Finally, a new design rule has been proposed to predict the response of <b>multi-bolt</b> <b>joints</b> (damage area and failure load) by using the response in single-bolt CBJ as an initial baseline...|$|R
40|$|Bolted joints feature {{extensively}} in composite aircraft structures, facilitating disassembly for maintenance while offering a cost effective joining method. However, inadequate tools for predicting failure of composite bolted joints {{have led to}} extensive physical testing programs and conservative design solutions. As usage of composites in airframe design has increased, the optimisation of composite bolted joints has become a key priority for aircraft manufacturers. The phasing out of metal in large commercial aircraft has now reached the fuselage structure, with next-generation aircraft such as the Airbus A 350 featuring all-composite designs. Bolted fuselage skin joints tend to be single-lap and incorporate countersunk fasteners for aerodynamic reasons. In order to investigate the mechanical behaviour of single-lap countersunk composite joints, detailed 3 D FE models have been developed. Initially, this difficult contact problem was studied elastically using the implicit FE solver, Abaqus/Standard. The mechanical response and hole boundary stress distributions were studied for clearance levels {{both inside and outside}} typical aerospace tolerances. Increased clearance delayed load take-up, reduced stiffness and altered hole boundary stresses. Significant convergence issues in these elastic implicit analyses prompted the choice of an explicit solver for challenging simulations of bearing failure in single and <b>multi-bolt</b> <b>joints.</b> A composite damage model was developed for the simulaton of bearing failure in 3 D Abaqus/Explicit joint models. Physically-based failure criteria and a crack band model ensured accurate and objective solutions. Predictions of bearing failure in quasistatically loaded, carbon-epoxy fuselage joints correlated well with experiment and gave a novel insight into the development of failure in countersunk composite joints. As part of a dynamic experimental test series, these fuselage joints were shear loaded at 5 m/s and 10 m/s. The final failure mode significantly affected energy absorption, which governs crashworthiness. The 3 D explicit approach was finally applied to study issues of concern to industry, which included dynamic simulations. The quasi-static mechanical behaviour of large, panel-level joints was also investigated. An automated Python scripting approach, developed to create 3 D composite bolted joints in Abaqus, was presented as a GUI which dramatically reduces model preparation times...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model of a three-bolt, single-lap composite joint is constructed using the non-linear finite element code MSC. Marc. The model is validated against an experiment where the load distribution in the joint is measured using instrumented bolts. Two different joint configurations are examined, one with neat-fit clearances at each bolt-hole and another with a 240 μm clearance at one hole with neat-fits at the others. Bearing and by-pass stresses are extracted from the model and {{used in conjunction with}} published bearing/by-pass diagrams to predict the failure load, mode and location for the joints. It is shown that the proposed model accurately predicts the failure behaviour of the joints, as determined from experiments on three-bolt joints loaded to failure. It is also shown that introducing a clearance into one hole significantly changes the failure sequence, but does not affect the ultimate failure load, mode orlocation. The proposed method demonstrates a simple approach to preg damage in complex <b>multi-bolt</b> composite <b>joints...</b>|$|R
40|$|A three-dimensional, implicit, {{finite element}} {{composites}} damage model is developed, {{and applied to}} a problem involving highly complex, three-dimensional loading, i. e. a single-lap, <b>multi-bolt,</b> composite <b>joint,</b> having variable clearances. The model extends a previous model, adding Puck’s criteria to allow delamination-like, transverse cracking-like or mixed mode failures to be simulated. Plasticity is also added for non-reversible strains in the undamaged parts of the matrix, and a mesh independence strategy is incorporated. A back-up strategy for when the Newton–Raphson method fails to converge, adds significantly to model robustness. The model is implemented in a commercial, implicit solver and demonstrates excellent robustness, being capable of following damage progression from onset, through bearing failure at the holes, to catastrophic, net-tension failure. The predicted failure modes and loads are in good agreement with experiment. The effect of clearance on secondary bending, and consequently on damage progression, is demonstrated. The current model shows better capability than our previous model for predicting matrix damage near the hole, which will be important for future fatigue modelling studies...|$|R

A simple bolt layout-two bolts on the tension axis-was selected. joint geometry was {{defined in terms}} of the end distance (E), the pitch distance (P), the side distance (S) and the bolt diameter (D). The joints were tested under four sets {{of environmental}} conditions: (a) normal (ambient temperature (similar to 20 degrees C) + dry), (b) hot (60 degrees C + dry), (c) wet (ambient temperature + 6. 5 weeks in water), and (d) hot-wet (60 degrees C + 6. 5 weeks in water). They were also tested with various geometries-that is, three, two and two values of the ratios (E/D), (P/D) and (S/D) respectively. A total of 144 joints were tested. Damage and failure loads together with failure modes were recorded. The effects of environmental conditions and joint geometries on damage and failure loads have been quantified and load reduction (knock-down) factors have been established for each of the environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{fasteners}} {{are used}} extensively in composite aircraft structures, offering a cost-effective, reliable and repeatable joining method while also facilitating disassembly for maintenance and repair. However, current design practices rely extensively on experimentation and detailed numerical analyses which are time consuming and expensive and thus significantly increase development and production costs. Although three-dimensional {{finite element analysis}} can be used in-lieu of more expensive experimental tests, current state-of-the-art computing technology cannot facilitate analysis of large-scale sub-structures (e. g. panels, wing spars, etc.) with potentially thousands of fasteners. The work conducted herein addresses this issue {{through the development of}} highly efficient analysis methodologies for bolted composite joints loaded at various rates. Several highly efficient numerical methods are developed that can account for laminate-laminate friction, bolt-hole clearance, non-linear material behaviour, bolt failure and loading-rate effects. Validated against quasi-static and high-rate experimental data, these methods have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art, due to their ability to accurately predict the response of multi-row, multi-column joints in seconds. Such an increase in efficiency is owed to the implementation of a series of parameterised functions which model the local mechanical behaviour of the fastener and fastened material. This approach allows the statistical variations arising from manufacturing and material processing to be easily accounted for, a feat that is impractical using traditional modelling techniques and near-impossible experimentally. Furthermore, these methods have been developed into user-friendly, stand-alone joint analysis tools and a user-defined finite element which is straightforward to implement in commercial finite element software. The developed analysis methods were used to investigate the effects of loading rate and relative spacing between fasteners in <b>multi-bolt</b> <b>joints.</b> Although loading rate effects primarily manifest as changes in joint failure loads and energy absorption, the propagation of stress waves also leads to variations in load distribution of up to 1. 7 % in the joints considered. Furthermore, it was found that a strain shielded region exists in all multi-fastener arrays and consequently any bolts positioned within this region carry a reduced proportion of load. When load is evenly distributed across the joint, increased failure initiation loads are to be expected, however, the most effective method of augmenting joint strength is through the use of additional fasteners. Additionally, the use of a load-path visualisation methodology gave novel insight into the role of fibre orientation on load transfer in bolted multi-directional laminates. It was found that load is transferred in a trajectory that is strongly dependent on fibre orientation, which is important in the distribution of load in multi-fastener joints...|$|R

The work presented in this thesis attempts to carry out an integrated and comprehensive programme of research on pultruded GRP bolted joints, {{in order to provide}} useful data, knowledge and guidance for design engineers seeking to use bolted joints in pultruded GRP structures. The research was sub-divided into three phases. Phase 1 included determining material properties, conducting tests in double-lap single-bolt tension joints at elevated temperature and starting to develop ANSYS FE models of single-bolt joints. Phase 2 covered testing of double-lap single-bolt tension joints under wet and hot-wet conditions, FE stress and displacement analyses of the tested joint geometries and assessing existing joint design approaches. In Phase 3 the focus was on testing concentrically loaded double-lap <b>multi-bolt</b> tension <b>joints</b> and FE modelling of these joints. In addition, work was undertaken on correlating strains around the hole edge, recorded using the PhotoStress method and conventional strain gauges, with FE analysis.

It has been found that, for the joints examined in this paper, our formulation is capable of modelling development of damage from bearing failure onset all the way to ultimate catastrophic net-tension failure without numerical problems, which is an advance over previous work. The predictions from the CDM model of net-tension failure modes and ultimate loads are in good agreement with those from the experiments. Furthermore the model is capable of explaining some non-intuitive experimental findings, such as the larger energy absorption obtained in joints with higher clearances...|$|R

The review is written {{with regard to the}} appraisal of existing connection design procedures for plate-to-plate bolted joints. It is shown that 15 uncoordinated series of tests on single-bolt and <b>multi-bolt</b> double lap <b>joints</b> provide 800 ultimate strength results. Each of the series of tests had different objectives and so different joint variables were studied. This reflects the current state of guidance on joint design and installation in pultruders' design manuals and elsewhere, which is shown to be limited and inconsistent. By rationalizing the number of variables the authors have tested a further 900 joints in order to generate a larger database of strengths and modes of failure, which may be used to appraise connection design procedures, such as the Hart-Smith and EUROCOMP Design Code and Handbook simplified and rigorous methods.
