5|$|The medal {{table is}} based on {{information}} provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. Medals won in team competitions—such as ice hockey—are counted only once, no matter how <b>many</b> <b>athletes</b> won medals as part of the team.|$|E

5|$|When Rocky was {{diagnosed}} with brain damage, {{it must be noted}} that <b>many</b> <b>athletes</b> have a form of brain damage including football players, soccer players, and other individuals in contact sports such as rugby, etc. Rocky never went for a second opinion and yielded to his wife's wishes to stop. So with the advent of new research techniques into brain damage, Rocky was found to be normal among fighters, and he was suffering the results of a severe concussion. By today's standards Rocky Balboa would be given a clean bill of health for fighters.|$|E
5|$|Félix Trinidad {{was born}} in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, to a Puerto Rican family. During his {{childhood}} {{the family moved to}} Cupey Alto, a subdivision of San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he grew up. His future wife, Sharon Santiago, lived in Cupey and first met Trinidad in the home of her neighborhood friend, a classmate of Trinidad's. Trinidad pursued a relationship with Santiago, including an attempt to impress her with his red Ford Mustang. He continued to press for her affection and, with the help of Santiago's neighbor, Trinidad was able to win her over. Early on, Santiago's mother thought that Trinidad was related to her daughter's friend, but she realized the true situation when she visited the friend's house and he acted nervous in her presence. Santiago's father objected to the relationship because Trinidad was an athlete; at the time <b>many</b> <b>athletes</b> had a negative public image. Santiago became rebellious, but Trinidad eventually won her family's trust. The couple was married four years after they began dating and have had four daughters. Trinidad has a fifth daughter, named Alondra Nicole, from another relationship.|$|E
5|$|Johnson began {{thinking}} of life after basketball while still {{playing with the}} Lakers. He wondered why so <b>many</b> <b>athletes</b> had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he {{had a meeting with}} Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he could about business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips. Johnson's first foray into business, a high-end sporting goods store named Magic 32, failed after only one year, costing him $200,000. The experience taught him to listen to his customers and find out what products they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in urban communities, creating redevelopment opportunities in underserved areas, most notably through his movie theaters and his partnership with Starbucks. He went to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz with the idea that he could successfully open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales. The partnership, called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as Detroit, Washington, D.C., Harlem, and the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Johnson sold his remaining interest in the stores back to the company in 2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership. Johnson has also invested in urban California real estate and financial service companies catering to America's underserved markets via his Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson funds. Another major project is with Chicago-based Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority businesses. In 2006-07, Johnson was part of a syndicate that bought the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, then the tallest building in Brooklyn, for $71 million and converted the 512-foot high landmark structure from an office building into luxury condominiums.|$|E

5|$|The program's {{coaching}} {{extended beyond}} just within the program itself. Bowerman had his athletes mentor {{the community and}} continued to be active in the sport after his retirement. He was also a coach for the US Olympic team in 1972 and an assistant coach in 1968 US Olympic Team. Bill Dellinger coached the distance runners in the 1984 Olympic Games. After Dellinger retired from the University of Oregon, he continued to coach running on a consulting basis despite suffering through a stroke. Tom Heinonen remained a running coach after his retirement at the volunteer level for the University of Oregon Running Club. Alumnus Alberto Salazar became a noted marathon coach after his running days under the employ of Nike. Salazar used controversial coaching tactics like tweaking runners' natural running form, but had coached <b>many</b> <b>athletes</b> to the apex of their careers. He launched an experimental training program called the Oregon Project financed by Nike {{with the purpose of}} integrating African runners' training conditions into American training mixed with modern technology. He also discovered similarities in running posture between sprinters and top level distance runners, two disciplines previously thought to be exceedingly different. Instilling some of these methods into American runners, he was able to coach Kara Goucher to a third-place finish in the Boston Marathon in 2009, an event that East Africans typically dominate. Mo Farah and alumnus Galen Rupp were training partners under Salazar and finished first and second respectively in the 2012 Summer Olympics in the 10k. Rupp was the first American to medal in the 10k since Billy Mills in 1964 and the first medalist not born in Africa since 1988. Also running for Salazar and the Oregon Project, alumnus Matthew Centrowitz Jr. won a gold medal in the 2016 Summer Olympics, the first American to win gold in the 1,500m since Mel Sheppard in 1908, ending a 108 year drought. Similar to his collegiate coaches, Salazar wrote a pair of books about distance running. Matt Centrowitz, another University of Oregon alumnus and father of Matthew, took the American University track and field program to prominence since the rebirth of the program in 1999.|$|E

25|$|Athletes {{qualified}} for the men's Olympic Trials by competing in preliminary tryouts.

25|$|The 2006 South American Championships in Athletics {{were held}} at the Estadio La Independencia in Tunja, Colombia from 29 September to 1 October.

Four of these men were also members of the winning team in the 4x100 meters relay at the same games - Jesse Owens (1936), Bobby Morrow (1956), Carl Lewis (1984), and Usain Bolt (2008, 2012, 2016). Two of these men have won a fourth {{gold medal at the}} same games - Archie Hahn in the now defunct 60 metres, and both Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis in the long jump.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc {{countries such as}} East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other amateur weight lifters. In response {{to the success of}} Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician John Ziegler worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS with reduced androgenic effects. Ziegler's work resulted in the production of methandrostenolone, which Ciba Pharmaceuticals marketed as Dianabol. The new steroid was approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1958. It was most commonly administered to burn victims and the elderly. The drug's off-label users were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. Although Ziegler prescribed only small doses to athletes, he soon discovered that those having abused Dianabol suffered from enlarged prostates and atrophied testes. AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the IOC in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because <b>many</b> <b>athletes</b> used AAS in their training period rather than during competition.|$|E
