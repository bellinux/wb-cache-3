40|$|Sovereign {{ratings and}} civil {{liability}} of credit agencies Recent reports confirm the inquiry {{of the italian}} Corte dei Conti into S&P, Fitch, Moody’s, considering whether their false or “reckeless” sovereing ratings caused a demage to Italy. Since the financial crisis erose, even in U. S. many legal actions have been taken against rating agencies by Federal Government (DoJ) and many member States. This essay investigates the nature of credit agencies’ liability for demages caused to States depending on soverein ratings and legal limits of the Corte dei conti’s jurisdiction. Demages caused by misleading credit ratings may affects both investors and financial institutions or, more in general, issuers, determinig <b>multiple</b> <b>liability</b> claims. Recent UE reform (Reg. n. 462 / 2013) of Regulation n. 1060 / 2009 on credit rating agencies has introduced a new civil liability claim: under sec. 35 bis of Reg. n. 1060 / 2013, where a credit rating agency has committed intentionally or with gross negligence, any of the infringements listed in Annex III {{having an impact on}} a credit rating, an investor or issuer may claim damages from that credit rating agency for damage caused to it due to that infringement. This Article does not exclude further civil liability claims in accordance with national law. To this extent, it has to be considered that sovereign ratings affects States reliability and trustwothiness, certainly causing demages: however this particular kind of action for demages is limited by art. 17, sec 30 ter, of d. l. 78 / 2009 : (a) the offender must be a civil servant and (b) he must be found guilty of a criminal offence. The Corte di Cassazione (Cass. Pen., sez. III, 4 febbraio 2014, n. 5481) has recently affirmed that the criminal offence needed could be any of the ones ruled by the Criminal Code: so, even the market manipulation criminal offence contested to S&P, Fitch and Moody’s in Trani Tribunal’s trial. By the way, the role of the offender (being a civil servant) still is a legal binding requirement...|$|E

40|$|Major Depression (MD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) are {{psychiatric}} disorders {{that arise from}} dysfunction of the core human capacities for emotion. Sapience is inextricably {{bound up with the}} potential for feelings of regret, worry and concern. When these emotions lead to clinically significant impairment or distress, they may result in {{one or both of the}} disorders of MD and GAD. The occurrence of MD and GAD in the same person, known as comorbidity, is remarkably high; substantially higher than would be expected by chance. MD and GAD have been studied since the mid- 20 th century, resulting in a substantial body of literature. The personality trait of neuroticism is also known to correlate highly with these disorders. This project was designed to compare the etiological structure of MD and GAD using a range of psychosocial and genetic methods in three datasets, while also assessing the correlated trait of neuroticism. Results are used to inform theoretical formulation of an approximate model of comorbidity for the two disorders. Psychosocial findings suggest that MD and GAD have similar relationships with most risk factors, and that neuroticism displays results consistent with it composing a portion of the liability to MD and GAD. Efforts to detect specific genetic loci involved in the etiology of MD and GAD are modestly successful. Two genome-wide significant variants were found for MD (one already identified in the literature); two for GAD, and one for neuroticism. There were also a number of significant genomic regions for each outcome. The use of aggregate genetic methods to estimate heritability based on genotypes was less successful. Estimation was only successful in one sample of the three, and produced modest estimates of heritability (0. 2 - 0. 25) for MD and comorbid MD+GAD. Genetic correlation was estimated to be very high between neuroticism and MD. Models of comorbidity are evaluated in light of these results, and a model comprising <b>multiple</b> <b>liability</b> distributions, one shared entirely by MD and GAD, and two additional correlated ones for the two disorders, with reciprocal phenotypic causation, is deemed most consistent with observed evidence...|$|E
40|$|Doctoral Thesis in Law The defence of passing-on and Indirect Purchaser Standing as Components of Private Enforcement of EU Antitrust Rules Summaries The present work {{investigated}} one of {{the most}} complex and controversial issues in the field of private enforcement of antitrust rules, the passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing. The research question that guided us throughout this work was: how should the passing-on defence be designed in order to (i) guarantee full compensation to both the direct and indirect purchasers; (ii) to prevent that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant is unjustly enriched; and (iii) to prevent the <b>multiple</b> <b>liability</b> and over-deterrence of the defendant? This work attempted to answer these questions. In doing so, it explored the US private antitrust enforcement policy, the Supreme Courts case law, State law and court practice, the legislative proposals regarding the passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing, and academic literature. In antitrust cases the assistance of economists to help to overcome {{one of the}} complex issues in designing private enforcement, i. e. quantifying damages and calculating the degree of passing-on, is inevitable. This research provided therefore an overview of the degree of complexity of the methods which can be used to calculate the passing-on by relying on conclusions and statements of economists. Against this, the current situation of private enforcement of private enforcement in Europe is analyzed. It explored first the antitrust enforcement policy. Then an overview and analysis of the ECJs long standing case law on the development of EU law principles, rights and remedies is provided. These developments are the milestones in the course of horizontal liability and the right to claim damages from other individuals under EU law. After this analysis, it then sought to explore the ECJs case law on the extra-contractual liability of the EU and Member States and horizontal liability of individuals for damages. Consequently, the ECJs case law, selected Member States (Germany, England, Belgium and the Netherlands) on tort law has been investigated. Then, the Member States restitution law based on unjust enrichment and undue payment is considered. Subsequently, the Commissions Green, White and Draft Directive on the issues of passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing are analyzed. Finally, general conclusions and additional proposed options are provided. PART I Passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing in the United States of America The stated purpose of this part was to explore the problem of passing-on by relying on the US Supreme Courts case law, state law and conclusions and statement of economists. Chapter 1 focused primarily on private antitrust enforcement policy in the US. It revealed that the US courts and antitrust agencies, as part of their interpretation and enforcement of federal antitrust laws adopted an optimal deterrence and efficiency-oriented approaches. In order to achieve these aims, not only the legislator but also the Supreme Court and the lower courts have imposed limitations on standing and to recover damages for antitrust infringements as embodied in Article 4 of the Clayton and Article 1 of the Sherman Acts. The most radical limitation is the rejection of passing-on defence in Hanover Shoe and the indirect purchaser standing in Illinois Brick. These two seminal decisions have received phenomenal attention and led to a split between Federal and State courts. Chapter 2 focused exclusively on passing-on defence. This chapter started with defining the passing-on defence and explaining its purpose, operation and effect. This chapter had further two aims. First, it aimed to explain why the defence gives rise to controversy, divided the academics and court and why the Supreme Court eventually rejected the defence. Second, it aimed to analyze the Supreme Courts Hanover Shoe decision and the academic response and criticism to the Courts decision. The Supreme Courts reasoning behind the rejecting the defence was that the task of establishing passing-on would require convincing proof of virtually unascertainable figure, prove insurmountable and render the already complex antitrust damages actions completely unmanageable. As stated by the Supreme Court: we are not impressed with the argument that sound laws of economics require recognizing this passing-on defence. The Supreme Courts analysis rests on three, well grounded, premises, (i) it is difficult to establish that the buyer has raised his price in response to the overcharge. Second, it is an insurmountable task to proof that the first buyer could not or would not have raised its prices or maintained supra-competitive prices had the alleged overcharges ceased. Finally, the same difficulty applies in proving that that the first purchaser did not lose sales or profit margin thereafter. Chapter 3 focused exclusively on the Supreme Courts Illinois Brick case where it rejected the indirect purchaser standing. This chapter aimed to explain the Courts reasoning in rejecting the indirect purchaser standing and its exceptions to the indirect purchaser rule. It revealed that the Court barred also indirect purchasers from bringing pass-on antitrust claims under the federal antitrust claims. The Supreme Court rejected standing in Illinois Brick on three grounds: (i) symmetry with Hanover Shoe; (ii) considerations of efficiency and (iii) effectiveness. The Court feared for <b>multiple</b> <b>liability</b> of the defendant. Presumably, the difficulties of proof apply also for the offensive use of passing-on. The Supreme Court also found that indirect purchasers are less likely than direct purchasers to institute actions to recover illegal overcharges. The Court feared further that, even in case if procedural devices are introduced to bring all potential claimants in one single action: the difficulties likely to be encountered in management of [such] a class action would make the procedure equally inadequate. The Court feared, further that apportioning the recoveries among all of the potential will add whole new dimensions of complexity to treble-damage suits and seriously undermine their effectiveness. Chapter 4 was concerned with deciphering the legislative response to the Supreme Courts Illinois Brick decision. This chapter revealed that the Courts decision received a lot of criticism. The force of the criticism has driven the legislator to intervene by proposing legislation to overturn these decisions. In 1978, 1983 and 1990 - 1991 the Congress attempted to overturn the decision but failed to do so. The First Task Force, which has been constituted by the American Bar Association, proposed combining all the claims arising from a violation in one single forum (under one jurisdiction). They argued that this is the only practical alternative to avoid the concerns of the Supreme Court in Illinois Brick. An opt-in regime, aggregating and allocating damages for the whole class in one single forum is proposed. The minority, however, did not agree with these proposals which resulted in a minority report. They argued for an opt-out regime. They argued that, otherwise the claims of all injured persons will be subjected to any favourable or adverse judgment on liability. Instead, the minority proposed a bifurcated procedure as a solution. Under this procedure, the defendants violation and aggregate total damages will be determined first, following which defendants would be dismissed from the case. The minority describes the second stage as follows: If an award was made, the various claimant groups would then litigate between themselves their respective rights to share in the aggregate total and any sums remaining undistributed {{at the conclusion of the}} proceedings would be given to the state governments in the geographic areas affected. However, this procedure is criticized for being too revolutionary. The minority proposed further a class-wide damages assessment. The calculation of damages consists of a two-step procedure of first determining the aggregate damages to the class and then distributing the damage award proportionally among class member. The Congress new attempt to overturn the decision also failed in 1983. The Task Force criticized the proposed legislation because it failed to deal with the fundamental conflict in policy which the Supreme Court has twice resolved, first in Hanover Shoe and then in Illinois Brick. However, the Supreme Court also recognized, as a practical matter, that compensation objectives must sometimes give way to manageability and fairness. In other words, the decisions in Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick rest at bottom on the inescapable and very real practical problems which are likely to arise in indirect purchaser suits: (i) tracing overcharges; (ii) over-complexity; (iii) possible double recovery; (iv) inconsistent judgments and (v) dilution of interest in enforcing antitrust claims. The Task Force is convinced that the Supreme Courts Illinois Brick decision to bar indirect purchaser claims was founded on valid concerns. Chapter 5 presents itself as another important cornerstone of this thesis. This chapter provided an extensive analysis of the state responses to the Illinois Brick decision. The problems surrounding the passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing not only divided the academics but also the courts. Some state courts (and the legislator) have clearly accepted vis-à-vis the Supreme Court, the indirect purchaser standing and the defence of passing-on. Others state courts (and legislator) rejected the passing-on defence but allowed the indirect purchaser standing through Illinois Brick repealers. These states have one common feature: the courts in these states have showed that the Supreme Courts overstated concerns are not a reason to reject the indirect purchaser standing and passing-on defence. Here, the courts managed to overcome the Supreme Courts concerns for rejecting both the passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing. Chapter 6 is finally concerned with the current dual system of antitrust enforcement of the US. The objective of this chapter is to provide a clear understanding of two conflicting views of the US Supreme and state courts regarding the indirect purchaser standing and passing-on defence. Dual enforcement system as currently exists in the US has not only led to inconsistent judgments and uncoordinated litigations in multiple forums. Duplicative federal direct purchaser and state indirect purchaser litigation imposes undue burdens on the judicial system and the parties, wastes resources, increases the risk of duplicative recoveries, skews the parties incentives to settle and hinders efficient global settlements. The Task Force argues that concerns about inconsistent judgments and uncoordinated litigation in multiple forums might be addressed by consolidating in a single court all direct and indirect purchaser actions arising out of the same anticompetitive conduct. However, the Task Force stresses that consolidation alone will not avoid <b>multiple</b> <b>liability.</b> Therefore, the Task Force urges the Congress to provide a mechanism to apportion damages among direct and indirect purchasers. They argue that in the absence of such legislation, consolidation may simply complicate direct purchaser litigation and thereby impair deterrence. PART II Passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing in Europe Having established the US law on private enforcement, which undoubtedly constitutes a valuable source of inspiration for Europe, the second part focuses on EU and Member State law. Part II considers whether the defence of passing-on and intrinsically linked to it the indirect purchaser standing do or should form part of the EU and national Member States law (Germany, England, Belgium, England and the Netherlands). The focus of chapter 1 is on the antitrust enforcement policy in the EU. The dilemma that emerges, as a policy matter, with regard to the allowance or rejection of passing-on defence andindirect purchaser standing leads to the next question: which objectives, that is deterrence, compensation, efficiency, effectiveness and fairness are most valuated in Europe? The basis of this discussion is that unless a deterrence approach is adopted, the passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing forms part of EU law. This chapter revealed that both the ECJ and the Commission regard full compensation of all the victims of antitrust infringements as the primary objective of private enforcement. In Europe, as opposed to US, it is generally accepted that any damages award to the victim of any tort should provide for equitable restitution and should not serve as a source of enrichment. Full compensation of all the victims implies further that there can be no a priori as to the standing of all the victims to claim for damages. The ECJ opened the door in Courage and Manfredi to any individual to claim for damages as long as the conditions for tort liability are fulfilled, i. e. proof of infringement, harm and causal link. Chapter 2 provided an extensive analysis of the ECJs long standing case law on the development of EU law principles, rights and remedies. These developments are the milestones in the course of horizontal liability and the right to claim damages from other individuals under EU law. Analysis of the EU right to damages continues in Chapter 3. This chapter focused exclusively on the ECJs twin judgments, i. e. Courage and Manfredi, where it held that there is an EU right to damages for breach of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, which national Member States must respect. This chapter revealed that it is by all means certain that indirect purchasers do have standing but passing-on defence is an unsolved issue under EU law. Chapter 4 explored the ECJs case law on extra-contractual liability of the EU and Member States. The intention was to draw a general picture of the principles, as established by the ECJ, which also may be used as precedents in the field of private enforcement. Chapter 5 was concerned with the conditions which must be fulfilled to establish horizontal liability for breach of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. This chapter focused, in particular, on national laws of the Member States in order to analyze how the conditions for horizontal liability (e. g. heads of damages, causation) are applied and whether the national laws offers an effective protection of EU law and comply with the EU principles of effectiveness and equivalence. Chapter 6 formed another vital building block for this work. This chapter is divided in four parts and had a twofold purpose. These four parts discussed what the law (in Germany, England, Belgium and the Netherlands) in relation to the defence of passing-on and indirect purchaser is or should be. The view (passing-on defence and indirect purchaser standing allowed) formed in chapters 1, 2, 3 and reiterated here is that the defence is valid and forms part of the law of tort. The second purpose was to find out whether there is any law (case law) on the legal treatment of these issues in these Member States. Chapter 7 and 8 focused on the ECJs response to the passing-on defence in restitution cases. The ECJ dealt here with the passing-on defence in the context of extra-contractual liability of the EU and monetary liability of the Member States. The ECJ recognized the defence but did not demand it. The focus of chapter 9 was on the essence of passing-on defence in the law of restitution based on unjust enrichment. This chapter is divided in three major parts, i. e. English, Belgian and Dutch law. The intention was to show that the defence of passing-on forms an integral part of the law of restitution based on unjust enrichment. One common feature of these Member States is that unjust enrichment law is compensatory in character. This feature has important consequences for the defence for two reasons. First, the plaintiff should only be entitled to restitution of the defendants enrichment where the claimant has suffered loss. Second, restitution will be denied when the claimant has made good his loss by passing it on. An additional objective of this chapter is to show that the defence of passing-on does not play a role in the undue payment cases. Chapter 10 discussed the European Commissions initiatives, Green, White and Draft Directive. Finally, general conclusions and proposed options are provided. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|We {{typically}} regard aging industrial suburbs {{as among}} the least fortunate of suburban communities, possessing <b>multiple</b> <b>liabilities</b> that have undermined their viability while newer suburbs have flourished.

40|$|To {{enhance the}} image quality, we propose {{multiples}} least-squares reverse time migration (MLSRTM) that transforms each hydrophone into a virtual point source {{with a time}} history {{equal to that of}} the recorded data. Since each recorded trace is treated as a virtual source, knowledge of the source wavelet is not required. Numerical tests on synthetic data for the Sigsbee 2 B model and field data from Gulf of Mexico show that MLSRTM can improve the image quality by removing artifacts, balancing amplitudes, and suppressing crosstalk compared to standard migration of the free-surface <b>multiples.</b> The potential <b>liability</b> of this method is that multiples require several roundtrips between the reflector and the free surface, so that high frequencies in the multiples are attenuated compared to the primary reflections. This can lead to lower resolution in the migration image compared to that computed from primaries...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{begins with}} the puzzle of why law does not embrace the “product rule”; a mathematically-inclined judge or jury that thought a defendant. 6 {{likely to have been}} negligent and. 7 likely to have caused plaintiff’s harm might {{conclude}} that plaintiff had failed to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard. Following some discussion of a number of reactions to this puzzle, the Article advances the idea that the process of aggregating multiple jurors’ assessments overlooks valuable information. First, following the Condorcet Jury Theorem, agreement among jurors might raise our level of confidence beyond what the jurors themselves report. Second, a supermajority’s mean or median voter is likely to have a different assessment from that gained from the marginal juror. As such, a supermajority (or unanimity) rule may take the place of the product rule where there are <b>multiple</b> requirements for <b>liability</b> or guilt. An attempt to extract this inframarginal information more directly would likely generate strategic behavior problems. The analysis is extended to panels of judges, for whom outcome voting may (somewhat similarly) substitute for the produc...|$|R
40|$|Psychopathology theories, {{clinical}} observations, {{and research}} all point to <b>multiple</b> sources of <b>liability</b> to depression. This article uses a longitudinal twin-study design {{to characterize the}} contribution of two genetically-influenced sources of depression risk: the first corresponding to stress sensitivity and the second representing risk that is independent of stress sensitivity. The sample consisted of 606 pairs of same-sex adolescent twins recruited from Beijing, China. Mean (SD) age at intake (Wave 1) and follow-up (Wave 2) was 13. 2 (2. 6) and 15. 1 (2. 6) years, respectively. A Reaction Level index was developed to reflect individual differences in stress sensitivity. Biometric models were fit to examine the genetic influence on the variance of and covariance between stress sensitivity and depressive symptoms. Results showed that both Reaction Level and depressive symptoms were moderately heritable. The genetic correlation between depressive symptoms and Reaction Level was estimated to be. 884. Genetic contributions to Reaction Level accounted for 37. 5 % {{of the total variance}} of depressive symptoms. Another set of genetic factors, which did not contribute to Reaction Level, accounted for 10. 5 % of the total variance of depressive symptoms. We interpret our results {{within the context of a}} multifactorial polygenic model, whereby depression risk is due to the combined contribution of multiple genetic and environmental factors...|$|R
40|$|The hospitalist model, {{a system}} of health care {{delivery}} {{that has been in}} use for years in several European countries as well as Canada, appears to be gaining momentum in many hospitals across the nation. Several factors have driven this phenomenon, including the push by managed care organizations (MCOs) to provide higher quality care while decreasing costs, timeliness of inpatient visits, duplication of labwork and the shift of inpatient care to high acuity patients. 1 From an administrative perspective, the hospitalist model, in which physicians are dedicated to coordinating all aspects of inpatient care, seems more efficient than the traditional model. Primary care physicians are not unpredictably taken away from their practices, outpatients are not kept waiting and inpatients receive more responsive care. Because the hospitalist is located at the hospital all the time, primary care physicians can potentially see more patients in their practices and spend more time with each patient. However, as with any patient scenario involving <b>multiple</b> practitioners, potential <b>liability</b> exists — primarily in the areas of communication, followup, documentation and scope of practice. This article discusses the hospitalist movement and the potential professional liability issues surrounding its increasing implementation in the United States. NORCAL does not advocate any position on this emerging model but rather raises awareness to some areas of risk that should be considered. Areas of Risk for the Hospital The risks facing hospitals that utilize hospitalists are similar to the risks hospitals typically experience when utilizing independent contractors. These include the risks arising out of vicarious liability and corporate negligence. The Hospitalist: An Emerging Model for the U. S. Health Care System What is a Hospitalist? The term hospitalist is fairly new. Drs. Robert M...|$|R
40|$|Pension {{funds have}} been part of the private sector since the 1850 ’s. Defined Benefit pension plans [DB], where a company {{promises}} to make regular contributions to investment accounts held for participating employees in order to pay a promised lifelong annuity, are significant capital markets participants, amounting to 2. 3 trillion dollars in 2010 (Federal Reserve Board, 2013). In 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (SFAS 158), Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postemployment Plans, shifted information concerning funding status and pension asset/liability composition from disclosure in the footnotes to recognition in the financial statements. I add to the literature by being the first to examine the effect of recent pension reform during the financial crisis of 2008 - 09. This dissertation is comprised of three related essays. In my first essay, I investigate whether investors assign different pricing multiples to the various classes of pension assets when valuing firms. The pricing multiples on all classes of assets are significantly different from each other, but only investments in bonds and equities were value-relevant during the recent financial crisis. Consistent with investors viewing pension liabilities as liabilities of the firm, the pricing <b>multiples</b> on pension <b>liabilities</b> are significantly larger than those on non-pension liabilities. The only pension costs significantly associated with firm value are actual rate of return and interest expense. In my second essay, I investigate the role of accruals in predicting future cash flows, extending the Barth et al. (2001 a) model of the accrual process. Using market value of equity as a proxy for cash flows, the results of this study suggest that aggregate accounting amounts mask how the components of earnings affect investors’ ability to predict future cash flows. Disaggregating pension earnings components and accruals results in an increase in predictive power. During the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis, however, investors placed a greater (and negative) weight on the incremental information contained in the individual components of accruals. The inferences are robust to alternative specifications of accruals. Finally, in my third essay I investigate how investors view under-funded plans. On average, investors: view deficits arising from under-funded plans as belonging to the firm; reward firms with fully or over-funded pension plans; and encourage those funds with unfunded pension plans to become funded. Investors also encourage conservative pension asset allocations to mitigate firm risk, and smaller firms are perceived as being better able to handle the risk associated with underfunded plans. During the financial crisis of 2008 - 2009 underfunded status had a lower negative association with market value. In all three models, there are significant differences in pre- and post- SFAS 158 periods. These results are robust to various scenarios of the timing of the financial crisis and an alternative measure of funding...|$|R
