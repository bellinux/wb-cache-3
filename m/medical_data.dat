The first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3, was flown by Gus Grissom and John Young on March 23, 1965. Nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days, rendezvous, docking, and practical EVA, and gathering <b>medical</b> <b>data</b> {{on the effects of}} weightlessness on humans.|$|E

After being informed by Leon, Chris and Piers pursue Ada to an aircraft carrier, destroying cruise missiles laden with the C-virus. Leon, Helena, Sherry, and Jake confront Simmons over his involvement with the outbreaks, where Sherry covertly hands Jake's <b>medical</b> <b>data</b> to Leon in case of their captivity. Leon and Helena corner Simmons, who has been infected by a J'avo, where he confesses to having killed the President to keep him from disclosing the truth behind Raccoon City, which he believes would have led to the US losing its authority.

We describe {{the development and implementation}} of an algorithm for prospective surveillance of patients with acute hepatitis B using electronic <b>medical</b> record <b>data.</b> Initial algorithms were created by adapting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria for acute hepatitis B into electronic terms. The algorithms were tested by applying them to ambulatory electronic <b>medical</b> record <b>data</b> spanning 1990 to May 2006. A physician reviewer classified each case identified as acute or chronic infection. Additional criteria were added to algorithms in serial fashion to improve accuracy. The best algorithm was validated by applying it to prospective electronic <b>medical</b> record <b>data</b> from June 2006 through April 2008. Completeness of case capture was assessed by comparison with state health department records. A final algorithm including a positive hepatitis B specific test, elevated transaminases and bilirubin, absence of prior positive hepatitis B tests, and absence of an ICD 9 code for chronic hepatitis B identified 112 / 113 patients with acute hepatitis B (sensitivity 97. 4 %, 95 % confidence interval 94 - 100 %; specificity 93. 8 %, 95 % confidence interval 87 - 100 %). Application of this algorithm to prospective electronic <b>medical</b> record <b>data</b> identified 8 cases without false positives. These included 4 patients that had not been reported to the health department. There were no known cases of acute hepatitis B missed by the algorithm. An algorithm using codified electronic <b>medical</b> record <b>data</b> can reliably detect acute hepatitis B.
