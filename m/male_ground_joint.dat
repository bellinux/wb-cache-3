50|$|At the opening(s) at top of {{the neck}} of some glass flasks such as round-bottom flasks, retorts, or {{sometimes}} volumetric flasks, there are outer (or female) tapered (conical) <b>ground</b> glass <b>joints.</b> Some flasks, especially volumetric flasks, come with a stopper or cap for capping the opening at the {{top of the}} neck. Such stoppers can be made of glass or plastic. Glass stoppers typically have a matching tapered inner (or <b>male)</b> <b>ground</b> glass <b>joint</b> surface, but often only of stopper quality. Flasks which do not come with such stoppers or caps included may be capped with a rubber bung or cork stopper.|$|R

50|$|Different grades exist (e.g. thick or viscous, soft). The viscous one is {{used for}} {{standard}} stopcocks and ground joins. The soft grade is for large stopcocks and <b>ground</b> <b>joints,</b> desiccators, and for lower temperature use. Ramsay grease consists of paraffin wax, vaseline, and crude natural rubber, in ratio 1:3:7 to 1:8:16. Due to the rubber content it has less tendency to flow.|$|R

50|$|In the past, {{scientists}} constructed {{their own}} laboratory apparatus {{prior to the}} ubiquity of interchangeable <b>ground</b> glass <b>joints.</b> Today, commercially available parts connected by <b>ground</b> glass <b>joints</b> are preferred; where specialized glassware are required, they are made to measure using commercially available glass tubes by specialist glassblowers. For example, a Schlenk line is made of two large glass tubes, connected by stopcocks and smaller glass tubes, which are further connected to plastic hoses.|$|R
50|$|Lead-sheathed cables {{were also}} used for {{telephone}} cables, as the lead outer sheath lasted well buried in wet <b>ground.</b> <b>Jointing</b> such cables could also require wiped lead joints. A typical such joint would involve a joint or tee junction between cables, with the copper pairs inside joined by fine soldering and insulating, then the overall joint wrapped in lead sheet and soldered. Such jointing continued until the 1960s {{and the availability of}} polyethylene sheathed cables.|$|R

50|$|Two general {{types of}} <b>ground</b> glass <b>joints</b> are fairly {{commonly}} used: joints which are slightly conically tapered and {{ball and socket}} joints (sometimes called spherical joints).|$|R
50|$|<b>Ground</b> glass <b>joints</b> {{are used}} in {{laboratories}} to quickly and easily fit leak-tight apparatus together from commonly available parts. For example, a round bottom flask, Liebig condenser, and oil bubbler with <b>ground</b> glass <b>joints</b> may be rapidly fitted together to reflux a reaction mixture. This is a large improvement compared with older methods of custom-made glassware, which was time-consuming and expensive, {{or the use of}} less chemical resistant and heat resistant corks or rubber bungs and glass tubes as joints, which took time to prepare as well.|$|R
50|$|Crude {{versions}} of conically tapered <b>ground</b> glass <b>joints</b> {{have been made}} for quite a while, particularly for stoppers for glass bottles and retorts. These days, <b>ground</b> glass <b>joints</b> can be precisely ground to a reproducible taper or shape. They are made to join two glassware pieces together. One of the glassware items to be joined would have an inner (or <b>male)</b> <b>joint</b> with the <b>ground</b> glass surface facing outward and the other would have an outer (or female) joint of a correspondingly fitting taper with the ground glass surface facing inward.|$|R
