25|$|In 2011, {{the brewery}} had a {{capacity}} of over 1.5 million hectolitres (over 1 million barrels) per annum. Production in 2012 was 900,000 hectolitres, with around 40,000 hl in own brand sales. The bulk of the brewery's own production is cask conditioned ale but it also sells bottled and keg ales. The company's most famous beer is Strongarm, a 4% abv bitter introduced in 1955, and other regular beers are IPA, Bullion Gold and Trophy Special. Strongarm is made with 18 per cent crystal malt, which contributes significantly to its distinctive ruby red colour and its roasted, <b>malty</b> <b>flavour.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pot {{distilled}} gin represents the earliest style of gin, and is traditionally produced by pot distilling a fermented grain mash (malt wine) from barley or other grains, then redistilling it with flavouring botanicals {{to extract the}} aromatic compounds. The fermentation of grain mash produces a neutral alcohol (similar to vodka) that is predominately tasteless except for the iconic ethyl alcohol taste. A double gin can be produced by redistilling the first gin again with more botanicals. Due {{to the use of}} pot stills, the alcohol content of the distillate is relatively low; around 68% ABV for a single {{distilled gin}} or 76% ABV for a double gin. This type of gin is often aged in tanks or wooden casks, and retains a heavier, <b>malty</b> <b>flavour</b> that gives it a marked resemblance to whisky. Korenwijn (grain wine) and the oude (old) style of Geneva gin or Holland gin represent the most prominent gins of this class.|$|E

50|$|Jonge jenever has {{a neutral}} taste, like vodka, {{with a slight}} aroma of juniper and malt wine. Oude jenever has a smoother, very {{aromatic}} taste with <b>malty</b> <b>flavours.</b> Oude jenever is sometimes aged in wood; its malty, woody and smoky flavours resemble whisky.Different grains used in the production process - such as barley, wheat, spelt and rye - produce different flavoured jenevers.|$|R
5000|$|The sapodilla, {{better known}} locally as buah ciku. Its flesh has a grainy texture akin to ripened pear with a sweet <b>malty</b> <b>flavour.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{style is}} {{characterized}} by a medium to full body, a <b>malty</b> <b>flavour,</b> and a clean dry finish. In Germany, the term covers beers which vary in colour from pale (Helles Märzen), through amber to dark brown (Dunkles Märzen). Common names for Märzen include Märzenbier, Wiener Märzen, Festbier, and Oktoberfestbier.|$|E
5000|$|Courage Best Bitter (4 percent ABV in cask and keg, 3.8 {{percent in}} bottles and cans). It is {{described}} as [...] "pale in colour, fully balanced with a <b>malty</b> <b>flavour</b> and distinctive hop character, and makes for an easy drinking session beer". Courage Best Bitter sponsors local events within its south west of England heartland. It {{remains one of the}} UK's top ten ales.|$|E
50|$|Tennent's Lager is Scotland's best-selling pale lager, with {{approximately}} 60% of the Scottish lager market. The lager was first brewed in 1885 by Hugh Tennent, and in 1893 it won the highest award at the Chicago World's Fair. It {{is described as}} a distinctive, well-balanced lager whose sweet, <b>malty</b> <b>flavours</b> combine with a tangy hoppiness to create its crisp, refreshing character. Tennent's Lager is certified by the Vegetarian Society as being suitable for vegetarians.|$|R
5|$|While {{a variety}} of beers are popular across Northern England, the region is {{especially}} associated with brown ales such as Newcastle Brown Ale, Double Maxim and Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. Beer in the North is usually served with a thick head which accentuates the nutty, <b>malty</b> <b>flavours</b> preferred in Northern beers. On the non-alcoholic side, the North – in particular, Lancashire – was {{the hub of the}} temperance bar movement which popularised soft drinks such as dandelion and burdock, Tizer and Vimto.|$|R
50|$|Decoction mashing {{is where}} a {{proportion}} of the grains are boiled {{and then returned to}} the mash, raising the temperature. The boiling extracts more starch from the grain by breaking down the cell walls of the grain. It can be classified into one-, two-, and three-step decoctions, depending on how many times part of the mash is drawn off to be boiled. It is a traditional method, and is common in German and Central European breweries. It was used out of necessity before the invention of thermometers allowed simpler step mashing. But the practice continues for many traditional beers because of the unique malty flavor it lends to the beer; boiling part of the grain results in Maillard reactions, which create melanoidins that lead to rich, <b>malty</b> <b>flavours.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many dunkels have a {{distinctive}} <b>malty</b> <b>flavour</b> {{that comes from}} a special brewing technique called decoction mashing. Most commonly, dunkel beers are dark lagers, but the term is also used to refer to dark wheat beers such as Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse Dunkel. Dunkel weizen is another term used to refer to dark wheat beers, which are fruity and sweet with more dark, roasted malts than their lighter counterpart, the hefeweizen.|$|E
50|$|Stories about ‘The Major’ abound. A legendary innovator, socialiser and traveller, {{he lived}} {{by his own}} rules and set his own standards. New ideas fascinated him and he wasn’t afraid to explore them. He was the first man in the Highlands to own a car. Glen Grant was the first {{distillery}} to have electric light. And he introduced the tall slender stills and purifiers which created the fresh <b>malty</b> <b>flavour</b> and clear colour that defines Glen Grant whisky to this day.|$|E
5000|$|Dunkel, or Dunkles, {{is a word}} {{used for}} several types of dark German lager. Dunkel is the German word meaning dark, and dunkel beers {{typically}} range in colour from amber to dark reddish brown. They are characterized by their smooth <b>malty</b> <b>flavour.</b> In informal terms, such as when ordering at a bar, [...] "dunkel" [...] is likely to mean whatever dark beer the bar has on tap, or sells most of; in much of north and western Germany, especially near Düsseldorf, this may be altbier.|$|E
50|$|Andwell's description: “Light amber best bitter with {{balanced}} aromas bitterness”. The brewery's literature {{says that}} this bitter is named after a town in the Arctic. Adam Komrower, the brewery's founder visited 'Resolute' in 2007 from where he {{set out on the}} 2007 Polar Challenge to reach the 1996 Magnetic North Pole. The bitter has a <b>malty</b> and hoppy <b>flavour</b> with a light amber colour and has the lowest alcohol content of Andwell's beers.|$|R
50|$|Ceylon {{green tea}} is mainly made from Assamese tea stock. It is grown in Idalgashinna in Uva Province. Ceylon green teas {{generally}} have the fuller {{body and the}} more pungent, rather <b>malty,</b> nutty <b>flavour</b> characteristic of the teas originating from Assamese seed stock. The tea grade names of most Ceylon green teas reflect traditional Chinese green tea nomenclature, such as tightly rolled gunpowder tea, or more open leaf tea grades with Chinese names like Chun Mee. Overall, the green teas from Sri Lanka have their own characteristics at this time - {{they tend to be}} darker in both the dry and infused leaf, and their flavour is richer. As market demand preferences change, the Ceylon green tea producers start using more of the original Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese and Brazilian seed base, which produces the very light and sparkling bright yellow colour and more delicate, sweet flavour with which most of the world market associates with green teas. At this time, Sri Lanka remains a very minor producer of green teas and its green teas, like those of India and Kenya, remain an acquired taste. Much of the green tea produced in Sri Lanka is exported to North Africa and Middle Eastern markets.|$|R
5000|$|Assam Tea is a {{black tea}} named after the region of its production, Assam, in India. It is also {{traditionally}} used in Yunnan province in China. Assam tea is manufactured specifically from the plant Camellia sinensis var. assamica (Masters). This tea, most of which is grown at or near sea level, {{is known for its}} body, briskness, <b>malty</b> <b>flavour,</b> and strong, bright colour. Assam teas, or blends containing Assam, are often sold as [...] "breakfast" [...] teas. For instance, Irish breakfast tea, a maltier and stronger breakfast tea, consists of small-sized Assam tea leaves.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the most suitable}} types of sorghum for whole grain adjunct in lager beer brewing, 14 cultivars of five different types: white tan-plant, white not tan-plant, red non-tannin, white tannin (Type II), and red tannin (Type III) were evaluated. The effects of grain type on wort physico-chemical and sensory quality with raw grain and malt plus commercial enzyme mashing were assessed. Tannin content correlated significantly and negatively with wort extract and fermentable sugars (p< 0. 001) and free amino nitrogen (FAN) (p< 0. 1). This is attributable to inactivation of the exogenous enzymes by the tannins during the mashing process. However, the Type II tannin sorghums had wort quality attributes closer to the non-tannin sorghum types, probably due to their relatively low tannin content (≤ 1 %). Malting gave a great improvement in wort extract, fermentable sugars and FAN but substantially influenced wort sensory properties in terms of higher sourness, bitterness and astringency {{as well as the}} expected more <b>malty</b> <b>flavour.</b> Worts from raw red non-tannin sorghums were similar to those of white tan-plant sorghums in both physico-chemical and sensory quality. Thus, red non-tannin sorghums, in view of their better agronomic quality, have considerable potential as whole grain adjunct in lager brewing.

40|$|The {{control of}} Listeria monocytogenes in soft cheese {{manufacture}} remains a challenge {{due to its}} widespread occurrence, ability to grow at refrigerated temperatures and salt resistance. The application of antimicrobial compounds produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as natural preservatives for improving cheese quality and safety has attracted significant research interest. The {{aim of this study}} was to select non-dairy origin LAB strains with anti-Listeria activity and to characterise their industrially relevant properties for potential roles as biopreservative adjunct cultures for use in cheese production. A total of 897 LAB isolated from herbs, fruits and vegetables were screened for their anti-Listeria activity using an MRS agar overlay assay. Fourteen isolates with strong activity were identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing as Lactococcus lactis and all contained the nisin gene cluster. Of these fourteen isolates, four strains also showed detectable anti-Listeria activity in a milk medium. These wild Lc. lactis strains possessed slow lactose utilisation and acidification capacity in milk despite exhibiting high growth rates. This was likely due to the adoption of the mixed acid fermentation pathway since ethanol was a major metabolic end product. Analysis of volatiles in milk and laboratory scale cheese fermented with wild and industrial Lc. lactis strain combination using headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) GC-MS identified up to a 300 – 400 fold increase in the production of 3 -methylbutanal, an important cheese odorant with a <b>malty</b> <b>flavour.</b> Whole genome sequencing of four wild strains provided some genetic insights into their phenotypes. The wild Lc. lactis lack the lactose utilisation operon (lacABCDFEG) commonly found in industrial strains, but contain genes encoding a putative β-galactosidase and a previously characterised alternative lactose assimilation pathway with slow lactose uptake. Wild strains also contain genes encoding α-keto-acid decarboxylase (kdcA) required for 3 -methylbutanal production. These results provide insight into technological properties of wild non-dairy Lc. lactis strains which could be potentially used as biopreservative adjunct cultures to control the growth of L. monocytogenes in cheese...|$|E
