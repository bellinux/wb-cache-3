5000|$|The <b>moulding</b> <b>plane,</b> {{which is}} used to cut {{mouldings}} along the edge of a board.|$|E
5000|$|In woodworking, a <b>moulding</b> <b>plane</b> (molding {{plane in}} US spelling) is a {{specialised}} plane used {{for making the}} complex shapes found in wooden mouldings.|$|E
5000|$|In modern industry, {{the work}} of the <b>moulding</b> <b>plane</b> has been taken up by the {{electrically}} powered spindle moulder or wood shaper. On a smaller scale, the hand-held or table-mounted electric router allows the use of interchangeable router bits {{of a wide variety of}} profiles and is readily available to the small business or home craftsperson.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, <b>moulding</b> <b>planes</b> were {{blocks of}} wear {{resistant}} hardwood, often beech or maple, which were worked {{to the shape}} of the intended moulding. The blade, or iron was likewise formed to the intended moulding profile and secured {{in the body of the}} plane with a wooden wedge. A traditional cabinetmakers shop might have many, perhaps hundreds, of <b>moulding</b> <b>planes</b> for the full range of work to be performed. The late nineteenth century brought modern types which were all-metal affairs such as the American Stanley No. 55 Universal Plane and the English Record No. 405 Multi-Plane with a wide variety of interchangeable cutters, integral fences, and [...] "nickers", small cutting edges which score the grain fibers when working across the board.|$|R

25|$|Hollows and Rounds {{are similar}} to <b>moulding</b> <b>planes,</b> but lack a {{specific}} moulding profile. Instead, they cut either a simple concave or convex shape on the face or edge of a board to create a single element of a complex-profile moulding. They are used in pairs or sets of various sizes to create moulding profile elements such as fillets, coves, bullnoses, thumbnails ovolos, ogees, etc. When making mouldings, hollows and rounds must be used together to create the several shapes of the profile. However, they {{may be used as}} a single plane to create a simple decorative cove or round-over {{on the edge of a}} board. Many of these hollows and rounds can be classified in the category of side-escapement planes.|$|R
50|$|Carving linenfold {{decoration}} requires little carpentry {{skill or}} training, {{and it can}} be mass-produced by a semi-skilled workforce: the creased designs were run with a moulding plane; only top and bottom edges needed to be finished with a chisel. Significantly, linenfold had no prototype in architectural practice: the technique of the <b>moulding</b> <b>plane</b> is not applicable to stone-cutting. Workshops were established by the later 15th century to cater to the developing market for inexpensively ceiled rooms, supplementing the more complicated, and more expensive, patterns of tracery used in the earliest interior panelling.|$|E
40|$|Casting is an {{important}} rubber manufacturing process for both production and material developments. A quick and flexible way of testing the constitutive materials properties of rubber products {{is very important for}} optimising the processing parameters and quality control. In many cases, standard tests such as tensile or compression tests are time consuming and require a large volume of materials. This work reports some recent work in using a combined numerical and experimental approach to characterise the properties of rubber materials during a casting process. Durometer shore hardness is used to test silicone rubbers (as a model material) with different compositions on different <b>moulding</b> <b>planes</b> and the linear elastic property is estimated from the hardnesses. The predicted properties are systematically compared with the experimental tests on hard and soft silicone rubber samples with different compositions. The work shows that shore hardness can be used as an effective way to monitor the materials properties during a moulding process for process optimisation and quality control...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of {{numerical}} simulation {{of the flow of}} liquid steel {{with the use of a}} multiphase model. The facility under study was a mould designed for continuous casting of steel slabs. The geometry of the facility, along with the computational grid, was generated within the program Ansys-MeshingR. Numerical computations were performed in the programs: COMSOL Multiphysics¯ and Ansys-Fluent¯. The use of the multiphase model enabled the determination of the behavior of the liquid slag layer on the metal bath surface. From the performed computer simulations, the fields of liquid steel motion and liquid steel turbulence kinetic energy distribution in the <b>mould's</b> symmetry <b>plane</b> have been presented. Based on the values recorded at selected measurement points located on the slag surface, a diagram illustrating the variation of the slag layer position during continuous steel casting has been plotted...|$|R
