30|$|All three plywood {{variants}} made of unmodified beech veneers showed comparable dimensional stability, {{irrespective of}} plasma pre-treatment, production process, and <b>melamine</b> <b>resin</b> concentration. The authors attribute this {{behavior on the}} one hand to the generally low WPG-value of the unmodified beech veneers after the chosen immersion duration (plasma/reference). On the other hand, it might also be explained by a possible penetration of the <b>melamine</b> <b>resin</b> from the <b>glue</b> line (despite the presence of additives) during the pressing process of “reference 0 ”, leading to a certain impregnation effect of these samples, which in consequence diminishes the differences between “reference 0 ” and “plasma”. In contrast, the samples made of thermally modified beech veneers showed distinctly improved dimensional stability when veneers are plasma pre-treated, compared to reference 0 and reference samples (for both concentrations). This {{can be explained by the}} fact that the hydrophobic properties of thermally modified veneers impede the penetration of <b>melamine</b> <b>resin</b> into the bulk (applies to the reference and reference 0 samples). The improved dimensional stability of plasma-treated samples made from thermally modified veneers results in a significantly higher melamine uptake (see Fig.  3)—due to the over-proportional plasma effect displayed by the thermally modified beech veneers in comparison to unmodified beech.|$|R

40|$|After {{a storage}} time of one year, the {{influence}} of different catalyst systems on the release of formaldehyde and volatile acids from particleboards bonded with unmodified and modified UF-resins was studied at 30 C (only for formaldehyde), 40 C and 50 C and 100 % relative humidity. The results reveal that modification of UF-resins with a <b>melamine</b> <b>resin</b> and resorcinol significantly increases the hydrolysis resistance of the UF-resin in the boards. Resorcinol, especially at higher temperatures, was even more effective than <b>melamine</b> <b>resin.</b> Measurable differences in the formaldehyde release of particleboards were detected.

40|$|A {{combination}} of an alkyd resin with a melamine-formaldehyde resin gives a cured enamel film with {{the flexibility of}} the alkyd constituent and the high chemical resistance and hardness of the <b>melamine</b> <b>resin</b> at the same time. The <b>melamine</b> <b>resin</b> is a minor constituent and plays the role of a crosslinking agent. In this paper, alkyd resins of high hydroxyl numbers based on trimethylolpropane, ricinoleic acid and phthalic anhydride were synthesized. Two alkyds having 30 and 40 wt% of ricinoleic acid were formulated by calculation on alkyd constant. Alkyds were characterized by FTIR and by the determination of acid and hydroxyl numbers. Then synthesized alkyds were made into baking enamels by mixing with melamine-formaldehyde resins (weight ratio of 70 : 30 based on dried mass). Two types of commercial <b>melamine</b> <b>resins</b> were used: threeisobutoxymethyl melamine-formaldehyde resin (TIMMF) and hexamethoxymethyl <b>melamine</b> <b>resin</b> (HMMMF). Prepared alkyd/melamine resin mixtures were cured in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) under non-isothermal mode. Apparent degree of curing as a function of temperature was calculated from the curing enthalpies. Kinetic parameters of curing were calculated using Freeman-Carroll method. TIMMF resin is more reactive with synthesized alkyds than HMMMF resin what was expected. Alkyd resin with 30 wt% of ricinoleic acid is slightly more reactive than alkyd with 40 wt% of ricinoleic acid, probably because it has the high contents of free hydroxyl and acid groups. The gel content, Tg, thermal stability, hardness, elasticity and impact resistance of coated films cured at 150 °C for 60 min were measured. Cured films show good thermal stability since the onset of films thermal degradation determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is observed at the temperatures from 281 to 329 °C. Films based on alkyd 30 are more thermal stable than those from alkyd 40, with the same <b>melamine</b> <b>resin.</b> The type of alkyd resin has no significant effect on the gel content and the hardness of film. Hardness of cured film increases with increasing of Tg. The values of the films elasticity are satisfied for all prepared samples and are independent on the type of alkyd or <b>melamine</b> <b>resin.</b> The impact resistances of coated films are very high...|$|R

Figure  6 depicts the results of plywood samples made of unmodified beech veneers impregnated with a 25 % <b>melamine</b> <b>resin</b> solution. In dry state, the thickness follows a distinctly asymptotic slope even for the samples made of plasma-pretreated veneers, whereas for the thickness in the wet state all variants follow a linear slope.

The increase in uptake of the thermally modified samples was 39 % for the 25 % solution, whereas the uptake of the 50 % solution was doubled.

40|$|Samples of Norway spruce wood were {{impregnated}} with a water-soluble <b>melamine</b> formaldehyde <b>resin</b> {{by using}} short-term vacuum treatment and long-term immersion, respectively.

After an immersion in aqueous <b>melamine</b> <b>resin</b> solution for 3 days, the resin had penetrated to a depth > 4 mm, which, after polymerization of the resin, resulted in an improvement of hardness comparable to the hardwood beech.

The dimension stabilisation caused by resin molecules that penetrated the wooden cell wall correlated with the molar mass of the resins used for impregnation.
