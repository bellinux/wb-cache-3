5|$|Andersen {{returned}} to the United Kingdom via Sweden, after episodes of unruly behaviour in Oslo. In the United Kingdom he had a personal audience with King Haakon VII of Norway. During the audience, Andersen and the King lunched at the Norwegian Club in London, and Andersen entertained the exiled monarch with stories. The King promised {{to take care of}} Andersen once the war was over. Andersen then joined the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy and served on a <b>Motor</b> <b>Torpedo</b> <b>Boat</b> (MTB) {{for the duration of the}} war. The MTB on which Andersen served repeatedly attacked shipping off the Norwegian coast.|$|E
5|$|Hangar 3, an {{original}} Belfast truss hangar, houses Duxford's maritime exhibition. The collection includes notable vessels and naval aircraft. Boats on display include Coastal Motor Boat 4, built by Thornycroft in 1916. She saw action during the Baltic campaign of 1918–19, and her commander Lieutenant Augustus Agar won the Victoria Cross for sinking the Russian cruiser Oleg on 17 June 1919. Other vessels include the Vosper <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> MTB-71, acquired from the British Military Powerboat Trust in 2005, {{an example of}} an X-Craft midget submarine, and a wartime Royal National Lifeboat Institution boat, the Jesse Lumb which was stationed at Bembridge on the Isle of Wight. A variety of naval aircraft are on display, including a de Havilland Sea Vixen, Sea Venom, and Sea Vampire, and a Westland Wasp helicopter which was embarked on the frigate HMS Apollo during the Falklands War.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the operation, {{a raid on}} the French {{coastal town}} of Dieppe had placed the German occupying forces on a high state of alert, and this {{ultimately}} contributed to Aquatint's failure. The commandos were also unable to identify their correct landing place due to the darkness. Within minutes of landing, the raiding party was ambushed by a German patrol and forced {{to try to reach}} their <b>Motor</b> <b>Torpedo</b> <b>Boat</b> (MTB) transport. The MTB was located and engaged by the German shore batteries, which damaged one of its engines. It was forced to withdraw, leaving the commandos behind. At the end of the raid those commandos who had not been killed all became prisoners of war. Only five of the raiding force would survive the war; one was killed in captivity and the fate of the other two is uncertain.|$|E

5|$|In {{getting the}} Philippine Army ready for war, MacArthur faced an {{enormous}} task. On {{a visit to}} the United States in 1937, MacArthur lobbied the Navy Department for the development of PT boats—small, fast boats armed with torpedoes—for which he believed that the geography of the Philippines, with its shallow waters and many coves, was ideally suited. The nascent Philippine Navy acquired three, known as Q boats, after President Manuel L. Quezon. In August 1941, the U.S. Navy created <b>Motor</b> <b>Torpedo</b> <b>Boat</b> Squadron Three, under the command of Lieutenant (junior grade) John D. Bulkeley. It was a half-strength squadron, with only six PT boats instead of the normal twelve, numbered 31 to 35 and 41. It arrived at Manila in September 1941. It was understood that a fleet consisting of more than PT boats would be required for a successful defense of the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|The Italian {{plans for}} an assault <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat,</b> the MTS model, began in December 1939. The Italian Naval Command goal was a small, high speed two-seat <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> based on the MTM. In {{addition}} to speed, seaworthiness and range should have made the motorboat capable of carrying out operations against anchored targets successfully. The MTS was armed with two 450mm torpedoes.|$|E

50|$|Protection for the {{exercise}} area {{came from the}} Royal Navy. Two destroyers, three <b>Motor</b> <b>Torpedo</b> <b>Boats</b> and two <b>Motor</b> Gun Boats patrolled the entrance to Lyme Bay and <b>Motor</b> <b>Torpedo</b> <b>Boats</b> watched the Cherbourg area where German E-boats were based.|$|R
50|$|The Jymy class <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boats</b> (English: Rumble) or J {{class was}} an Italian-designed class of <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boats,</b> seeing service during World War II with the Italian Navy in the Lake Ladoga, and {{later with the}} Finnish Navy in the Gulf of Finland.|$|R
50|$|The Finnish Navy used several {{different}} types of <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boats</b> during World War II. Four Soviet <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boats</b> were captured and commissioned by the Finnish Navy during the World War II. One of these was of larger D-3 class while three others belonged to G-5 class.|$|R
25|$|MTB 345 was transported from Weymouth in England to Inverness in Scotland by train, and was relaunched on 24 April 1943. The <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> {{was ready}} for {{operations}} on 5 May and arrived at the Norwegian naval base at Lerwick in the Shetland Islands on 6 May. The vessel's commander was Lieutenant Alv Haldor Andresen, who was also the initiator of the experiment with light motor torpedo boats {{on the coast of}} Norway. MTB 345 formed part of 30th <b>Motor</b> <b>Torpedo</b> <b>Boat</b> Flotilla.|$|E

25|$|MTB 345 was an {{experimental}} <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> constructed in 1941, which saw limited service with the Royal Navy before being {{transferred to the}} exiled Royal Norwegian Navy on 16 March 1943. She sailed with the Royal Norwegian Navy for three months in 1943, until captured by German forces on 28 July 1943, during her second mission to the coast of occupied Norway. Two days after their capture, the crew of MTB 345 were executed by the Germans based on Hitler's Commando Order. Following their capture of MTB 345, the Germans pressed the <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> into Kriegsmarine service, renaming her SA 7. SA 7 was lost in {{a fire in the}} North Sea in August 1943.|$|E

5|$|The Orjen {{class of}} eight <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boats</b> {{was built for}} the Royal Yugoslav Navy between 1936 and 1939 at the Lürssen Shipyard. They {{were based on the}} German S-2 <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boats.</b> At the start of the Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia, two boats managed to escape to Alexandria in Egypt where they continued serving with Allied forces, including in operations against Vichy French forces in Syria. The remaining ones were captured by Italian forces and commissioned in the Regia Marina (Royal Italian Navy) with modified armament; they were also used by the Italians as the model for the Italian-built CRDA 60 t <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the evening}} of 13 February 1944 Henry was sailing along the coast near Hustadvika Bay by Hestskjær Lighthouse off the port of Kristiansund in Møre og Romsdal county. She was {{carrying}} a cargo of rocks from the Aust-Agder town of Risør northwards along the coastline. In addition to the Norwegians on board Henry she carried four German Army Gefreiters. At 1837hrs the SS Irma, a Hurtigruten passenger ship that had just overtaken Henry, was struck and sunk by what later {{turned out to be}} torpedoes fired from MTB 627, a Royal Norwegian Navy <b>Motor</b> <b>Torpedo</b> <b>Boat.</b> As Henry launched two of her lifeboats she too was torpedoed, by the other Royal Norwegian Navy <b>Motor</b> <b>Torpedo</b> <b>Boat</b> present, MTB 653. One of the two lifeboats were brought ashore at Hestskjær Lighthouse by the lighthouse keeper and later brought into Kristiansund.|$|E
25|$|The ships entered service between 1941 and 1946, and all {{but three}} of them were {{commissioned}} in time to participate in combat actions in World War II. The <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> tenders served in the Pacific during {{the latter half of the}} war, while the seaplane tenders saw service in virtually every theater in which the United States Navy operated during the war.|$|E

25|$|The <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> {{was soon}} spotted by the locals of the area, and {{eventually}} the Germans got word {{of the presence of}} MTB 345. On 28 July, seven German warships arrived on the scene, surrounding MTB 345s anchorage. The Luftwaffe provided air cover for the operation against MTB 345 from Herdla air base. Admiral Otto von Schrader was in overall command of the German forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of the post-World War II downsizing of the U.S. Navy {{and the decline of}} the seaplane and <b>motor</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> in U.S. naval operations meant that all but the newest ships decommissioned in 1946 and 1947. Those that did stay on in service as seaplane tenders decommissioned between the mid-1950s and 1960s, some seeing service in the Korean War (19501953). The last unit did not leave U.S. Navy service until 1973.|$|E
