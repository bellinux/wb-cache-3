50|$|Romania {{captured}} 36 K-20 armored tractors as of 1 November 1941. In {{the spring}} and summer of 1943, Romania refurbished 34 captured T-20 armored tractors, officially known as Șenileta Ford rusesc de captură (captured Soviet Ford small armoured vehicle) at Rogifer Factory (formerly known as Malaxa). Because the T-20 used a Ford motor built under license and Romania had a Ford truck plant in Bucharest, the overhaul and maintenance were simple tasks. The tractors were improved by the <b>mounting</b> of <b>hooks</b> for towing the German 50 mm PaK 38 antitank gun, at Parvan Marian Works. The 5th and 14th Infantry Divisions received twelve units each, the 2nd Armoured Regiment received six tractors and the 5th Cavalry Division received four units in August 1944. All vehicles were lost in combat or confiscated by the Red Army after King Michael's Coup.|$|R
2500|$|To achieve {{launching}} and {{recovery from the}} airship in flight, a 'skyhook' system was developed. The Sparrowhawk had a <b>hook</b> <b>mounted</b> above its top wing that attached to the cross-bar of a trapeze mounted on the carrier airship. For launching, the biplane's hook was engaged on the trapeze inside the airship's (internal) hangar, the trapeze was lowered clear of the hull into the (moving) airship's slipstream and, engine running, the Sparrowhawk would then disengage its hook and fall away from the airship. For recovery, the biplane would fly underneath its mother ship, until beneath the trapeze, climb up from below, and hook onto the cross-bar. The width of the trapeze cross-bar allowed a certain lateral lee-way in approach, the biplane's <b>hook</b> <b>mounting</b> had a guide rail to provide protection for the turning propeller (see photo), and engagement of the hook was automatic on positive contact between hook and trapeze. More than one attempt {{might have to be}} made before a successful engagement was achieved, for example in gusty conditions. Once the Sparrowhawk was securely caught, it could then be hoisted by the trapeze back within the airship's hull, the engine being cut as it passed the hangar door. Although seemingly a tricky maneuver, pilots soon learned the technique and it was described as being much easier than landing on a moving, pitching and rolling aircraft carrier. Almost inevitably, the pilots soon acquired the epithet [...] "The men on the Flying Trapeze" [...] and their aircraft were decorated with appropriate unit emblems.|$|R
25|$|The B6N1's Mamori 11 {{engine was}} found prone to severe {{vibrations}} and overheating at certain speeds {{and was at}} first judged too unreliable (an important consideration given that the plane was expected to fly long distances over open water). Following a series of modifications, though, the engine's performance was finally deemed promising enough that carrier acceptance trials were begun {{at the end of}} 1942. Subsequent test flights conducted aboard the carriers Ryuho and Zuikaku indicated the need to strengthen the tail <b>hook</b> <b>mounting</b> on the plane's fuselage. Some attempts were also made to use RATOG (rocket-assisted take-off gear) units on several B6N1s in order to qualify the aircraft for use on smaller carriers but the results were unsatisfactory.|$|R

2500|$|A 1976 AMC Pacer Hatchback {{was used}} in the 1992 movie Wayne's World, and again in the 1993 movie Wayne's World 2. The Pacer used in both movies was painted bright blue with flame decals, with stock steel wheels and wheel covers in the front, and {{aftermarket}} chrome-plated steel wheels in the rear. It featured a two-tone light blue-and-beige vinyl interior, as well as a licorice dispenser mounted in place of the overhead light in the headliner. The car is used throughout both movies, however, the car is seen the most in the first Wayne's World movie in the introductory scene, where Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) inserts a cassette tape into the stereo of the Pacer, and Wayne, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey), and his friends rock out and head bang to [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] by Queen. Modifications to the movie car included interior camera <b>mounts,</b> tow <b>hooks</b> welded to the front subframe, and the removal of the HVAC system. The rear wheel wells were modified to accommodate aftermarket speaker boxes, the aforementioned licorice dispenser was added, and an additional cup holder was added to the Pacer's dashboard. The car used an AMC 258 c.i. six-cylinder engine and an automatic transmission.|$|R
50|$|As {{the bolt}} is {{relatively}} light, an inertial rate reducer device housed inside the wooden pistol grip lowers the weapon's {{rate of fire}} from 1,000 rounds/min to a more manageable 850 rounds/min. The rate reducer operates as follows: when the bolt reaches {{the end of its}} rearward stroke it strikes and is caught by a spring-powered <b>hook</b> <b>mounted</b> on the back plate. At the same time it drives a lightweight, spring-loaded plunger down into the pistol grip. The plunger is easily accelerated and passes through a heavy weight which is left behind because of its inertia. The plunger, having compressed its spring, is driven up again and then meets the descending inertia buffer. This slows down the rising plunger which, when it reaches the top of its travel, rotates the hook, releasing the bolt which is driven forward by the compressed recoil springs.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} testing of systems for au-tonomous tracking, payload pickup, and deployment of cargo via a UAV helicopter. The tracking system uses a visual servoing al-gorithm and is tested using open loop velocity control of a 3 DOF gantry system with a camera mounted via a pan-tilt unit on the end effecter. The pickup system uses vision to control the cam-era pan tilt unit {{as well as a}} second pan tilt unit with a <b>hook</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the end of the}} arm. The ability of the pickup sys-tem to hook a target is tested by mounting it on the gantry while recorded helicopter velocities are played back by the gantry.

50|$|The Gewehr 98 oil {{finished}} rifle stock {{features a}} semi-pistol grip. A top handguard was standard on all rifles and {{extended from the}} front of the rear sight base terminating just ahead of the bottom barrel band. A steel cross bolt was mounted to distribute the forces and hence the effects of recoil on the stock bedding, reducing the chance to split the stock. The stock featured a quick detachable sling swivel on the underside of the butt stock, a top swivel located underneath the bottom barrel band, and a parade <b>hook</b> <b>mounted</b> on the underside of the top H-style barrel band. The prewar stocks were produced from walnut wood and were aged for an average of three years to allow the wood to stabilize. Beginning in 1917, walnut shortages necessitated the use of beech wood. The late-war production beech stocks were less durable and heavier than the original walnut stocks.|$|R
40|$|Feasible {{real-time}} {{swing angle}} measurement is significant {{to improve the}} efficiency and safety of industrial crane systems. This paper presents a wireless microelectromechanical system (MEMS) -based swing angle measurement system. The system consists of two attitude heading reference system (AHRS) sensing units with a wireless communication function, which are <b>mounted</b> on the <b>hook</b> (or payload) and the jib (or base) of the crane, respectively. With {{a combination of a}} three-axis accelerometer, a three-axis gyroscope and a three-axis magnetometer, the standard extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to estimate the desired orientation of the payload and the base. Wireless ZigBee communication is employed to transmit the orientation of the payload to the sensing unit mounted on the base, which measures the orientation of the base. Because several physical parameters from the payload to the base can be acquired from the original crane control system, the swing angles of the payload can be calculated based on the two measured orientation parameters together with the known physical parameters. Experiments were performed to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed swing angle measurement system...|$|R
5000|$|According to folklore, {{his real}} name was Andrew Christie, a Perth butcher. During a severe famine in the mid-fourteenth century (Hector Boece records floods, morrain, and plagues of [...] "myce and ratonis" [...] {{throughout}} Scotland in 1340), Christie joined a group of scavengers {{in the foothills of}} the Grampians. When one of the party died of starvation, Christie put his skills to work on the corpse and provided his companions with a ready meal. The group developed a taste for human flesh as, under Christie's leadership, they began to ambush travellers in the passes of the Grampians, feeding on their bodies and those of their horses. It is alleged that before attacking, Christie would haul his victims from their <b>mounts</b> with a <b>hook</b> on a rod: this implement was the [...] "cleke" [...] (i.e., [...] "crook") from which he took his sobriquet. Thirty riders apparently died at Christie's hands. Eventually the company was defeated by an armed force from Perth, except for Christie himself, who supposedly escaped and re-entered society under a new name.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} palatal mini-implants are {{effective}} as direct anchorage for distal {{movement of the}} upper molars. METHODS: It was used an acrylic model of the upper dental arch. After making a groove in the region corresponding to dental alveolus, acrylic teeth were fixed in groove with # 7 wax, with the roots being previously immersed in adhesive wax. The orthodontic appliance was placed according to the Edgewise technique and then a mini-implant (SIN, São Paulo, Brazil) was inserted at the site corresponding to the palatal raphe. A 0. 019 x 0. 025 -in stainless steel archwire was made and attached to the upper arch with elastics. A transpalatal arch bar (0. 019 x 0. 025 in) was <b>mounted</b> and two <b>hooks</b> were soldered to {{it in order to}} retain chain elastics (Unitek, Brazil) to be connected to the mini-implant under a force of 1. 5 N on each side. The maxillary model was immersed in water 40 times and photographed after each immersion, for observation of dental movements. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test were employed for analyzing the obtained data. RESULTS: Molars displaced distally 3. 1 mm, in average, with distal inclination ranging from 3 to 5 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Molar movements occurred due to distal inclination, with a slight rotation and no extrusive effect...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Various {{methods are}} used for {{treatment}} of open bite. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of Lower Anterior High Pull Headgear (LAHPH) appliance in Class I subjects with moderate open bite and high lower lip line. Materials and Methods: The study group was composed of 10 subjects with a mean age of 15. 8 ± 2. 5 years and 3. 05 ± 0. 07 mm moderate open bite. All the patients rejected orthognathic surgery. The treatment included extraction of upper and lower second premolars followed by leveling, banding, bonding, posterior space closure, and anterior retraction. After these procedures, the open bite was reduced to 2. 04 ± 1. 17 mm. Afterwards, LAHPH was applied for 18 hours per day for 8 ± 2 months. LAHPH appliance was composed of High Pull Headgear and two <b>hooks</b> <b>mounted</b> on its inner bow. Two elastics (1. 8, light, Dentaurum) connected the upper hooks on the inner bow to the lower hooks on the mandibular canines vertically. The forces produced by the prescribed elastics were 10 and 60 g during mouth closing and opening, respectively. Paired T-test was used to evaluate pre-andpost-treatment outcomes. Results: The pre-and post-treatment cephalometric evaluations showed that the LAHPH reduced effectively the open bite of the patients to 0. 15 ± 1. 7 mm (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: This appliance can be used as an acceptable method for closing the open bite in Class I subjects...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. ZoologyOnly a few {{species of}} the family Diplozoidae have {{previously}} been described from Africa, from various Labeo and Barbus species. An investigation was undertaken respectively in the Vaal Dam and Vaal River Barrage in the Vaal River system, South Africa to determine aspects of the morphology, taxonomy and ecology of specimens of this family collected from the gills of Barbus aeneus. Various fish species, namely B. aeneus, Barbus kimberleyensis, Labeo capensis, Labeo umbratus, Cyprinus carpio, Clarias gariepinus and Micropterus salmoides, were collected {{with the aid of}} gill nets. The fish were killed and the length, weight and sex determined. The gills were removed from the left and right gill chambers, placed in separate, marked petri dishes and covered with water from the dam. Gills (from first to fourth pair) were examined {{with the aid of a}} dissection microscope. The position of attachment and the region on the gill namely dorsal, median or ventral, was noted. Parasites were removed, fixed between a cover slip and glass slide in steaming hot aceto-formaldehyde alcohol and preserved in 70 % ethanol. A morphological study was undertaken. Results of a Scanning Electron Microscopy study illustrated the following external characteristics namely a round opisthohaptor with four pairs of clamps, while study of whole <b>mounts</b> revealed larval <b>hooks,</b> a round-ended intestine and eggs without filaments. Graphic reconstruction of serial sections of the reproductive system of parasites embedded in resin revealed that the vas deferens of one individual opens into the common vitelline duct of the other. Parasites were identified as belonging to the genus Paradiplozoon. The morphological characteristics, namely the round opisthohaptor, intestine with rounded ending, egg without filament and morphological measurements, of various structures (for example, total body length) that differ from other species of this genus, led to the establishment of a new species, that is, P. alwinii...|$|R
5000|$|The SZD-41A Jantar Standard {{was built}} {{primarily}} of Fibreglass-Epoxy resin composite with local strengthening from welded steel tube in the fuselage centre-section, foam ribs {{in the wings}} and plywood at equipment mounting points. The skin was composed of fibreglass laminates laid up in moulds to attain accurate profiles. The monowheel manually retractable landing gear hung from the steel tube centre section structure which also <b>mounted</b> the towing <b>hook</b> and wing attachments. Large plate style airbrakes aft of the mainspar extend from {{the top and bottom}} surfaces, with the gaps sealed by spring-loaded covers when closed, also operating the disk brake on the monowheel at full extension. The cantilever fibreglass-epoxy tailplane is attached {{to the top of the}} fin, trimming of the elevator was achieved by spring loading the control stick and adjusting the neutral loading position. 80 litres (later 100) of water ballast could be carried in plastic tanks in the wings and jettisoned as required. The semi-reclining seat is in a comfortable cockpit enclosed by a two-part canopy, the front part fixed and the rear hinged to open rearwards for entry/exit. After modifications to remove restrictions on the prototypes and improvements required after flight testing, production of the SZD-41A and SZD-41B Jantar Standard commenced, continuing till 1978 when 159 had been built, many of which were exported worldwide. In common with many SZD products, the aircraft was delivered with a full range of basic instruments from Polish suppliers, which led to the famous punch-line: [...] "There I was, 50ft, inverted, nothing on the clock but the makers' name, and that was in (expletive redacted) Polish" [...] used in Gliding Club Bars throughout the world to humourise recovery from perilous situations.|$|R
30|$|The hook as a shape occurs {{very early}} on the {{evolutionary}} scale. Cellulose appears as a biological building block in the Cambrian age from fossil records, and hooks {{have been found in}} chitinous organisms as mandibles, maxillae as well as tarsi. Hook separation forces associated with plant seed and fruit dispersal have been studied in four species by SN Gorb. A fifth, Arctium minus (or Burdock as it is commonly known) is purported to have been the source of engineering design inspiration for George de Mestral (see Velcro). There are marked differences in the shape and functionality of natural A. minus hooks, and the probabilistic fastener that he designed and developed, namely the needle-like profile for insertion of the A. minus hooks, their lack of reusability and their physical size. In functionality, Velcro resembles that of Circaea lutetiana, not A. minus. From the study of SN Gorb’s data, it is concluded that there are additional indicators for structural behaviour as well as the morphological variables indicated by Gorb, and these are flexible versus fixed bases to the shafts and degrees of resilience (stiffness, the inverse of Young’s modulus) of the component material. The natural substrate properties are presented as being indicative of the receptiveness of the hooks to a range of substrates. Field testing consisted of tensile testing <b>mounted</b> A. minus <b>hooks</b> in an Instron tensile tester in a laboratory to note the fracture strength (contact separation force) and mode of failure which was characteristic of a composite biomaterial. The study indicates that contrary to Gorb, the reduction in the size rendered the bending moment due to the hook span to be negligible and of little effect. Note that an early original botanical paper on A. minus is missing presumed lost from the British Library and that finite element analysis follows in paper III, and an experiment into the use of confocal microscopy (shape acquisition) in paper II. Results indicate that the contact separation force is independent of bending moment and the “span” of the hook, a scaling effect that is important for the design for manufacture (DFM) of micron range-sized hooks.|$|R
