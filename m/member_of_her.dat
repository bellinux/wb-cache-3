She was launched on 17 October 1864 and completed in April 1866. Two months later, in June, Italy declared war on Austria, {{as part of the}} Third Italian War of Independence, which was fought concurrently with the Austro-Prussian War. The Italian fleet commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, initially adopted a cautious course of action; he was unwilling to risk battle with the Austrian Navy, {{despite the fact that the}} Austrian fleet was much weaker than his own. Persano claimed he was simply waiting on the ironclad ram , en route from Britain, but his inaction weakened morale in the fleet, with many of his subordinates openly accusing him of cowardice.|$|E
5|$|From {{a family}} with no {{background}} of ballet or music, MacMillan was determined {{from an early age}} to become a dancer. The director of Sadler's Wells Ballet, Ninette de Valois, accepted him as a student and then a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> company. In the late 1940s, MacMillan built a successful career as a dancer, but, plagued by stage fright, he abandoned it while still in his twenties. After this he worked entirely as a choreographer; he created ten full-length ballets and more than fifty one-act pieces. In addition to his work for ballet companies he was active in television, musicals, non-musical drama, and opera.|$|E
5|$|Goito {{was built}} by the Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia shipyard; her keel was laid down in September 1885 and her {{completed}} hull was launched on 6 July 1887. She was completed on 16 February 1888 and commissioned into the fleet, the first <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> class to enter service. That year, she {{took part in the}} annual fleet maneuvers, along with five ironclads, a protected cruiser, the torpedo cruisers , , and , and numerous smaller vessels. The maneuvers consisted of close-order drills and a simulated attack on and defense of La Spezia. Later that year, the ship was present during a naval review held for the German Kaiser Wilhelm II during a visit to Italy.|$|E

5|$|Helena was {{the most}} {{active member of the}} royal family, {{carrying}} out an extensive programme of royal engagements at a time when royalty was not expected to appear often in public. She was also an active patron of charities, {{and was one of the}} founding members of the British Red Cross. She was founding president of the Royal School of Needlework, and president of the Workhouse Infirmary Nursing Association and the Royal British Nurses' Association. As president of the latter, she was a strong supporter of nurse registration against the advice of Florence Nightingale. She became the first <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> family to celebrate her 50th wedding anniversary in 1916, but her husband died a year later. Helena outlived him by six years, and died aged 77 at Schomberg House on 9 June 1923.|$|E
5|$|In June 1921, Provence and Bretagne went to Le Havre for a naval review, {{and were}} back in Toulon in September. In 1922, Provence and Lorraine were placed in reserve, leaving Bretagne the only <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> class in service; while out of service, Provence {{underwent}} a significant refit. The work lasted from 1 February 1922 to 4 July 1923, and {{was carried out in}} Toulon. The ship had her armament improved; her main guns were given greater elevation to increase their range, and four 75mm M1897 guns were installed on the forward superstructure. A heavy tripod mast with a fire control station and a rangefinder for the ship's anti-aircraft guns were also added.|$|E
5|$|Revenge was recommissioned the {{following}} year, {{after the start}} of World War I, to bombard the coast of Flanders as part of the Dover Patrol, during which she was hit four times, but was not seriously damaged. She had anti-torpedo bulges fitted in early 1915, the first ship to be fitted with them operationally. The ship was renamed Redoubtable later that year and was refitted as an accommodation ship {{by the end of the}} year. The last surviving <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> class, the ship was sold for scrap in November 1919.|$|E

5|$|Gorizia {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Odero-Terni-Orlando (OTO) {{shipyard}} in Livorno on 17 March 1930, the last <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> class. She was launched on 28 December that year, and was completed nearly a year later on 23 December 1931 when she was commissioned into the 2nd Division. She took part in naval exercises held off Naples on 13 August in honor of King Victor Emmanuel III. On the 25th, she became the flagship of the division. She participated in a naval review on 67 July 1933 in the Gulf of Naples for Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. On 16 September, the ship {{was transferred to the}} 1st Division, where she also served as the flagship. She received her battle flag from her namesake city on 29 June 1934. Gorizia escorted the royal yacht Savoia on a trip to the east coast of Africa in October; the tour included port calls in Berbera and Mogadishu in British and Italian Somaliland, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Illinois {{was laid}} down on 10 February 1897 by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company of Newport News, Virginia. She was {{launched}} on 4 October 1898, sponsored by Miss Nancy Leiter, daughter of Chicago multi-millionaire Levi Leiter and commissioned on 16 September 1901. The ship's first commander was Captain George A. Converse. Illinois {{was the first}} <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> class to be authorized, but the last to enter service. After commissioning, the ship began a shakedown cruise in the Chesapeake Bay, followed by initial training. She left the area on 20 November to test a new floating dry dock in Algiers, Louisiana. The ship was back in Newport News in January 1902. She served briefly as the flagship of Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans from 15 to 28 February; during this period, she {{took part in a}} reception for Prince Henry of Prussia, the brother of the German Kaiser.|$|E
5|$|Italy had {{declared}} neutrality {{at the start}} of World War I, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from Austro-Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Minerva was initially used to lay a series of defensive minefields, along with her sister Partenope and the cruiser , in support of this strategy. Minerva survived the war and was discarded in May 1921, the last surviving <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> class. She was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Like {{her sister}} ships, Köln {{served as a}} {{training}} ship for naval cadets in the 1930s, and joined the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War during {{the latter part of}} the decade. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she conducted several operations in the North Sea, but did not encounter any British warships. She participated in the attack on Bergen during Operation Weserübung in April 1940, and she was the only <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> class to survive the operation. In 1942, she was modified to carry a Flettner Fl 282 helicopter experimentally. Later in 1942, she returned to Norway, but did not see significant action. She remained there until early 1945, when she returned to Germany; in March, she was sunk by American bombers in Wilhelmshaven. She remained on an even keel, with her gun turrets above water; this allowed her to provide gunfire support to defenders of the city until the end of the war in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|Principe di Carignano {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Cantiere della Foce {{shipyard}} in Genoa in January 1861, the first Italian ironclad to be domestically produced. She was launched on 15 September 1863 and was completed on 11 June 1865. She was the only <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> class ready for service {{by the time the}} Third Italian War of Independence broke out between Italy and the Austrian Empire in June 1866, which was fought concurrently with the Austro-Prussian War. The Italian fleet commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, initially adopted a cautious course of action; he was unwilling to risk battle with the Austrian Navy, {{despite the fact that the}} Austrian fleet was much weaker than his own.

5|$|SMS Custoza was an ironclad warship {{built for}} the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the 1870s, the only <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> class. She was the first Austro-Hungarian ironclad to be built after the navy studied {{the results of the}} Battle of Lissa of 1866; she was also the first iron-hulled capital ship to be {{built for the}} Austro-Hungarian Navy. She was laid down in November 1869, {{launched}} in August 1872, and completed in February 1875. Her career was fairly limited, in part due to reduced naval budgets in the 1870s that also delayed her completion. Custoza was somewhat more active in the 1880s, taking part in an international naval demonstration against the Ottoman Empire in 1880, being modernized in 1882, and a trip to Spain for the Barcelona Universal Exposition in 1888. The ship became a training ship in 1902, was converted into a barracks ship in 1914, and after World War I, was awarded as a war prize to Italy. Custoza was immediately broken up.|$|E
