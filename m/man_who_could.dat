5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor. Faced with a major crisis, he desperately needed {{the support of a}} <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> restore his damaged reputation. The only {{candidate}} with sufficient military experience, consular ancestry, and connections was Trajan. Likewise, Edward Gibbon's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found little support among modern historians.|$|E
5|$|As the {{convention}} began, Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York, the floor {{leader for the}} Grant forces (known as the Stalwart faction), proposed that the delegates pledge to support the eventual nominee in the general election. When three West Virginia delegates declined to be so bound, Conkling sought to expel them from {{the convention}}. Garfield rose to defend the men, giving a passionate speech in defense {{of their right to}} reserve judgment. The crowd turned against Conkling, and he withdrew the motion. The performance delighted Garfield's boosters, who now believed more than ever that he was the only <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> attract a majority of the delegates' votes.|$|E

These three men were joined in the room later by the mystery figure who was introduced as Vladislav, a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> help Litvinenko win a lucrative contract with a Moscow-based private security firm.|$|E

5|$|In 1993 the {{evolutionary}} biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared Paley to Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss, the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley can claim {{that even the}} agonising pain of gallstones or gout could indicate the goodness of a loving God, with the justification that it felt so good when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that he respects it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a Lamarckist kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation that men have not lost their nipples through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation.|$|E
5|$|Tan {{and four}} blind friends auditioned for the inaugural season of Project SuperStar, but only he was {{accepted}} as a contestant. Throughout the competition, there was extensive debate over whether viewers were voting for him out of sympathy and whether a blind <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not dance deserved the title. Further controversy arose when his home address was posted online and fans offered him sex services. Nevertheless, he emerged as the male champion and entered the grand final against female champion Kelly Poon. The judges gave Poon more favourable reviews, but Tan garnered 64% of the 533,000 telephone votes. Both finalists also released limited edition singles; Tan's cover of 童话 (Fairytale) by Michael Wong sold 12,239 copies, while Poon's cover of 遗失的美好 (Lost Goodness) by Angela Chang sold 11,319 copies. Thus Tan became the grand champion and was awarded a recording contract with Play Music (later acquired by Warner Music).|$|E

5000|$|The Zeugitae (ζευγῖται) or zeugitai {{were members}} of the third {{division}} of ancient Athens after the political reforms of Solon. The zeugitae were those whose property or estate could produce 200 medimnoi of wet or dry goods (or their equivalent), per year. The term appears to have come from the Greek word for [...] "yoke", which has led modern scholars to conclude that zeugitae were either <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> afford a yoke of oxen or <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were [...] "yoked together" [...] in the phalanx—that is, <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> afford their own hoplite armor.|$|R

25|$|Each {{person had}} an honour-price, which varied {{depending}} on their rank in society. This honour-price was {{to be paid to}} them if their honour was violated by certain offences. Those of higher rank had a higher honour-price. However, an offence against the property of a poor <b>man</b> (<b>who</b> <b>could</b> ill afford it), was punished more harshly than a similar offence upon a wealthy man. The clergy were more harshly punished than the laity. When a layman had paid his fine he would go through a probationary period and then regain his standing, but a clergyman could never regain his standing.|$|E

In the same year he was returned for Liverpool as successor to Canning, and as the only <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> reconcile the Tory merchants to a free trade policy. Among the more important legislative changes with which he was principally connected were a reform of the Navigation Acts, admitting other nations to a full equality and reciprocity of shipping duties; the repeal of the labour laws; the introduction of a new sinking fund; the reduction of the duties on manufactures and on the importation of foreign goods, and the repeal of the quarantine duties.|$|E

Despite rumors that Rasputin was having sex with some of his female followers, he won over the father superior of the Seven Lakes Monastery outside Kazan, as well as a local church officials Archimandrite Andrei and Bishop Chrysthanos, who gave him a letter of recommendation to Bishop Sergei, the rector of the St. Petersburg Theological Seminary at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, and arranged for him to travel to St. Petersburg, either in 1903 or in the winter of 1904-1905.|$|E

25|$|Oesch got the {{opportunity}} to show his talents as front commander in March 1940. The Red Army had surprised the Finns by crossing the frozen Bay of Viipuri and gained a foothold on its western shore. Mannerheim had created the Coast Group to repel the enemy, but its first commander Major General Kurt Martti Wallenius was dismissed in disgrace after holding the command for only three days. The situation was extremely critical, and Oesch was appointed to deal with it. Finnish defenses consisted mainly of badly equipped coast defense battalions manned by older reservists and battalions hastily transferred from Lapland. Oesch was able to hold this motley and weary force together {{until the end of}} the war on 13 March 1940, causing heavy losses for the Red Army and significantly slowing its advance. Mannerheim began to regard Oesch as a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> deal with difficult situations.|$|E

Due to many people missing, she collected a large sum of money in her boat. However, Lü Dongbin, one of the Eight Immortals, helped a merchant hit Guanyin in the hair with silver powder, which floated away in the water. Guanyin bit her finger and a drop of blood fell into the water, but she vanished. This blood was swallowed by a washer woman, who gave birth to Chen Jinggu (陳靖姑) or Lady Linshui (臨水夫人); the hair was turned into a female white snake and sexually used men and killed rival women. The snake and Chen were to be mortal enemies. The merchant was sent to be reborn as Liu Qi (劉杞).|$|E
