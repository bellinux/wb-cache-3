25|$|In {{statistical}} mechanics, {{the correlation}} function {{is a measure}} of the order in a system, as characterized by a <b>mathematical</b> <b>correlation</b> function. Correlation functions describe how microscopic variables, such as spin and density, at different positions are related. More specifically, correlation functions quantify how microscopic variables co-vary with one another on average across space and time. A classic example of such spatial correlations is in ferro- and antiferromagnetic materials, where the spins prefer to align parallel and antiparallel with their nearest neighbors, respectively. The spatial correlation between spins in such materials is shown in the figure to the right.|$|E

Duesberg along with other researchers, in a 1998 paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reported a <b>mathematical</b> <b>correlation</b> between chromosome number and the genetic instability of cancer cells, which they dubbed [...] "the ploidy factor," [...] confirming earlier research by other groups that demonstrated an association between degree of aneuploidy and metastasis. Although unwilling to concur with Duesberg in throwing out a role for cancer genes, many researchers do support exploration of alternative hypotheses. Research and debate on this subject is ongoing. In 2007, Scientific American published an article by Duesberg on his aneuploidy cancer theory.

Moreover, the single term exponential model, logarithmic model, linear logarithmic model and power model were all examined in this work. The performance of the aforementioned correlations as global solar radiation estimators was evaluated by comparing the predicted values with the measured values. Different statistical error tests were employed to examine the accuracy of the mathematical models.

Materials and Methods: We used simulation tool for the distribution functions of the density values of the correlation coefficient in small samples. A method for quantization of the data, allows obtaining a discrete spectrum states {{of one of the}} varieties of correlation functional. This allows us to consider the proposed structure as a <b>mathematical</b> <b>correlation</b> molecule, described by some analogue continuous-quantum Schrödinger equation.

You can expect a mathematical synthesis of molecules for a large number of known statistical tests and statistical moments.
