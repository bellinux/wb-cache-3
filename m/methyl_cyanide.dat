40|$|A {{spectral}} {{survey of}} Orion-KL {{has been carried}} out in the 2 mm atmospheric window in the frequency range 149. 6 - 159. 6 GHz, using the FCRAO 14 m telescope. Typical sensitivities achieved were T(sub A sup *) approximately 0. 03 - 0. 1 K, peak-to-peak. Over 180 spectral lines were detected, including approximately 45 unidentified features. The spectra were measured with a single-sideband receiver and, even at levels of T(sub A sup *) approximately 30 mK, are far from being confusion-limited. Fifteen known species were conclusively identified in Orion in this spectral region, with the largest numbers of lines arising from <b>methyl</b> formate, ethyl <b>cyanide,</b> methanol, and dimethyl ether. These species have beam-averaged column densities of N(sub tot) approximately 0. 5 - 8 x 10 (exp 15) /sq cm. Several other species have been tentatively observed, including acetaldehyde, C 2 S, and possibly EtOH. The large organic species, however, appear to arise from different regions. For example, CH 3 CCH and (CH 3) 2 O come primarily from the extended ridge, while EtCN and VyCN exclusively arise in the hot core.

40|$|We present {{here the}} study of two {{radicals}}: The cyanooxomethyl (OCCN) and ketenyl (HCCO) radicals. Both of these radicals were chosen for their importance to atmospheric and astrophysical phenomena and {{also because of the}} lack of spectroscopic study on these systems. The OCCN radical was generated through the UV dissociation of carefully chosen precursors: <b>methyl</b> cyanoformate, carbonyl <b>cyanide</b> and pivaloyl cyanide. These were chosen because of their high branching ratio for the production of the OCCN radical. The HCCO radical was generated through the UV dissociation of ethyl ethynyl ether, that has a unit quantum yield for the production of HCCO. In both of these studies, IR emission from these dissociation reactions was monitored through time resolved FTIR emission spectroscopy with sub microsecond time resolution. From this study we have identified two previously unidentified vibrational modes of OCCN and one unobserved mode of HCCO. We have also been able to identify the range of the fundamental of the v 2 stretch of HCCO(ã 4 A″) and its corresponding intersystem crossing rate constant in collisions with inert gases helium, neon and argon. A branching ratio of quartet state to ground state HCCO is presented based on information obtained from the integrated time profiles of the ν 2 stretch of HCCO (X˜ 2 A″). ^ We also present a new analytical technique called Two Dimensional CrossSpectral Correlation Analysis that is based on generalized two-dimensional correlations spectroscopy. This technique is useful for helping to identify common emission features in multiple systems under constant experimental conditions that may be weak or overlapping. This technique aided greatly in solidifying the assignment of the ν 1 stretch of the OCCN radical and was able to tease out a second weak feature in the spectra, the ν 2 CO stretch. ...|$|R

We performed SiO observations with the VLA interferometer in the J = 1 - 0 v= 0 transition and with the SMA array in the 5 - 4 transition. A complementary IRAM 30 -m single-dish survey in the (2 - 1), (3 - 2), (5 - 4), and (6 - 5) SiO lines was also carried out. Two collimated SiO high-velocity outflows driven by the A 2 and C millimeter continuum massive cores have been imaged. On the other hand, we detected no SiO outflow driven by the young stellar objects in more evolved evolutionary phases {{that are associated with}} ultracompact (B) or hypercompact (A 1) HII regions. The LVG analysis reveals high-density gas (10 ^ 3 - 10 ^ 4 cm- 3), with well constrained SiO column densities (0. 5 - 1 10 ^ 15 cm- 2). The driving source of the A 2 outflow is associated with typical hot core tracers such as <b>methyl</b> formate, vinyl <b>cyanide,</b> cyanoacetilene, and acetone. The driving source of the main SiO outflow in G 24 has an estimated luminosity of a few 10 ^ 4 Lsun (typical of a late O-type star) and is embedded in the 1. 3 mm continuum core A 2, which in turn is located at the centre of a hot core that rotates on a plane perpendicular to the outflow main axis. The present SiO images support a scenario similar to the low-mass case for massive star formation, where jets that are clearly traced by SiO emission, create outflows of swept-up ambient gas usually traced by CO.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this work}} Titan's {{atmospheric}} chemistry is simulated using a capacitively coupled plasma radio frequency discharge in a N(2) -CH(4) stationnary flux. Samples of Titan's tholins are produced in gaseous mixtures containing either 2 or 10 % methane before the plasma discharge, covering the methane concentration range measured in Titan's atmosphere. We study their solubility and associated morphology, their infrared spectroscopy signature {{and the mass}} distribution of the soluble fraction by mass spectrometry. An important result is to highlight that the previous Titan's tholin solubility studies are inappropriate to fully characterize such a heterogeneous organic matter and we develop a new protocol to evaluate quantitatively tholins solubility. We find that tholins contain up to 35 % in mass of molecules soluble in methanol, attached to a hardly insoluble fraction. Methanol is then chosen as a discriminating solvent to characterize the differences between soluble and insoluble species constituting the bulk tholins. No significant morphological change of shape or surface feature is derived from scanning electron microscopy after the extraction of the soluble fraction. This observation suggests a solid structure despite an important porosity of the grains. Infrared spectroscopy is recorded for both fractions. The IR spectra of the bulk, soluble, and insoluble tholins fractions {{are found to be}} very similar and reveal identical chemical signatures of nitrogen bearing functions and aliphatic groups. This result confirms that the chemical information collected when analyzing only the soluble fraction provides a valuable insight representative of the bulk material. The soluble fraction is ionized with an atmospheric pressure photoionization source and analyzed by a hybrid mass spectrometer. The congested mass spectra with one peak at every mass unit between 50 and 800 u confirm that the soluble fraction contains a complex mixture of organic molecules. The broad distribution, however, exhibits a regular pattern of mass clusters. Tandem collision induced dissociation analysis is performed in the negative ion mode to retrieve structural information. It reveals that (i) the molecules are ended by <b>methyl,</b> amine and <b>cyanide</b> groups, (ii) a 27 u neutral moiety (most probably HCN) is often released in the fragmentation of tholin anions, and (iii) an ubiquitous ionic fragment at m/z 66 is found in all tandem spectra.

40|$|Volatile {{components}} {{present at}} spoilage of refrigerated chicken breasts were identified using high-vacuum-low-temperature distillation techniques followed by analysis with combined temperature-programmed gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. A comparison {{was made of}} the compounds detected from both irradiated and non-irradiated muscle stored at 2 and 10 degrees C under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Isolates were randomly selected from the spoiled poultry, identified, and evaluated for their ability to produce volatile spoilage noted when grown on radiation-sterilized chicken. Several isolates that produced off-odors on sterile chicken breasts were examined. Twenty-two compounds were associated with spoilage. Some of the compounds found on both irradiated and unirradiated samples were considered to play only a minor role in the spoilage aroma or were present in low concentrations, since the aroma of spoiled irradiated chicken lacked the harsh odor notes typical of spoiled unirradiated chicken. Fifteen of the 22 compounds were considered to be unique to unirradiated, aerobically spoiled samples. Nine of these compounds, hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, heptadiene, methanol, and ethanol, were found on chicken spoiled at both 2 and 10 degrees C. xylene, benzaldehyde, and 2, 3 -dithiahexane were detected only in samples stored at 2 degrees C and methyl thiolacetate, 2 -butanone, and ethyl propionate were associated with 10 degrees C spoilage. Fifty-eight isolates randomly selected from fresh, radiation-pasteurized, and unirradiated spoiled poultry were classified taxonomically, and 10 of them, which produced spoilage odors on sterilized chicken breasts, were selected for subsequent analysis of their volatiles. Isolates identified as Pseudomonas putrefaciens and Pseudomonas species that were members of groups I and II of Shewan's classification, as well as Flavobacterium and oxidative Moraxella, produced a number of the compounds found in the aroma of spoiled chicken. A total of 17 compounds were identified. Whereas no isolate produced all of the aroma compounds found in the aroma of spoiled chicken, together they did produce the nine found in unirradiated samples spoiled at either 2 or 10 degrees C, as well as methyl thiolacetate and xylene. Six compounds were present in the volatiles produced by the isolates but were absent in the volatiles identified from spoiled chicken.

40|$|Hot cores in {{molecular}} clouds, such as Orion KL, Sgr B 2, W 51 e 1 /e 2, {{are characterized}} {{by the presence of}} molecules at temperature high enough to significantly populate their low-frequency vibrationally excited states. For complex organic molecules, characterized by a dense spectrum both in the ground state and in the excited states, such as <b>methyl</b> formate, ethyl <b>cyanide</b> or dimethyl ether, lines from vibrationally excited states certainly participate to the spectral confusion. Aims. Thanks to the recent laboratory study of the first torsional excited mode of methyl formate, we have searched for methyl formate, HCOOCH 3, in its first torsionally excited state (υt= 1) in the molecular cloud W 51 e 2. Methods. We have performed observations of the molecular cloud W 51 e 2 in different spectral regions at 1. 3, 2 and 3 mm with the IRAM 30 m single dish antenna. Results. Methyl formate in its first torsionally excited state (υt= 1 at 131 cm− 1) is detected for the first time toward W 51 e 2. 82 transitions have been detected among which 46 are unblended with other species. For a total of 16 A-E pairs in the observed spectrum, 9 are unblended; these 9 pairs are all detected. All transitions from excited methyl formate within the observed spectral range are actually detected and no strong lines are missing. The column density of the excited state is comparable to that of the ground state. For a source size of 7 ′′we find that Trot = 104 ± 14 K and N = 9. 4 + 4. 0 − 2. 8 × 1016 cm− 2 for the excited state and Trot = 176 ± 24 K and N = 1. 7 +. 2 −. 2 × 1017 cm− 2 for the ground state. Lines from ethyl cyanide in its two first excited states (υt= 1, torsion mode at 212 cm− 1) and (υb= 1, CCN in-plane bending mode at 206 cm− 1) are also present in the observed spectrum. However blending problems prevent a precise estimate of its abundance. However as for methyl formate it should be comparable with the ground state for which we find Trot = 103 ± 9 K and N = 3. 7 + 0. 6 − 0. 4 × 1015 cm− 2 for a 7 ′′source size. Conclusions. With regard to the number of lines of excited methyl formate and ethyl cyanide detected in W 51 e 2, it appears that excited states of large molecules certainly account for a large number of unidentified lines in spectral survey of molecular clouds...|$|R

However, there is no exact comparison between the deviations from a first order dependence on substrate and oxidant, and the variation of stoichiometry with substrate concentration. The approximate reactivity order is: p-NO 2 C 6 H 4 Me The oxidation of di-isopropyl ether is slower than the oxidations of the bensyl ethers. Larger yields of acetone are obtained than {{can be explained by the}} stoichiometry of a reaction scheme analogous to that shown in equations v. to viii. This indicates that there is a short regenerative chain: (v.) Me 2 Ċ OPr i ⟶ Me 2 CO + Pr i• (vi.) Pr i• + Me 2 CHOPr i ⟶ Me 2 Ċ OPr i + C 3 H 8 which ran produce acetone without consumption of cobaltic ions. The oxidation of 2, 2 '- dichlorodiethyl ether is autocatalytic, and liberates chloride ions. The autocatalysis is ascribed to the rearrangement of an intermediate radical to yield chloride ions which are then oxidised to Cl •, or else to elimination of Cl • from the primary radical. The Cl • radicals can then attack the substrate ether. The substrates which have been investigated are all rather insoluble, and so solutions containing high concentrations of <b>methyl</b> <b>cyanide</b> co-solvent were necessary. The increase in the oxidation rates of the hydrocarbons and ethers with increasing <b>methyl</b> <b>cyanide</b> concentration is far too large to fit the expression: (xi.) k = k o e MX (where X is % <b>methyl</b> <b>cyanide</b> v/v) which has been previously found satisfactory for solutions of up to 50 % <b>methyl</b> <b>cyanide.</b> Spectral changes indicate that a cobaltic-methyl cyanide complex, which is an active oxidant, is formed. Its enhanced reactivity is due to a decrease in the energy of activation for the oxidations, which outweighs the effect of a less favourable activation entropy. In general, the thesis shows that reaction mechanisms cannot be elucidated solely from a knowledge of reaction kinetics. Accurate measurements of reaction products are also necessary before any interpretation of mechanism can be attempted. Thus, similar kinetic behaviour is found a. when the same substrate is oxidised to give different products under different conditions; and b. when similar substrates are oxidised by quite different routes. </p...|$|E
