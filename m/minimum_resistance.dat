40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the possibility of}} making conductive and dry adhesive interfaces between multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) and nanofiber (MWNF) arrays grown by chemical vapor deposition with transition-metal as catalyst on highly Boron doped silicon substrates. The maximum observed adhesion force between MWNT and MWNF surfaces is 3. 5 mN for an apparent contact area of 2 mm by 4 mm. The <b>minimum</b> contact <b>resistance</b> measured {{at the same time}} is approx. 20 Omega. Contact resistances of MWNT-MWNT and MWNT-gold interfaces were also measured as pressure forces around several mN were applied at the interface. The resulting <b>minimum</b> contact <b>resistances</b> are on the same order but with considerable variation from sample to sample. For MWNT-MWNT contacts, a <b>minimum</b> contact <b>resistance</b> of approx. 1 Omega is observed for a contact area of 2 mm by 1 mm. The relatively high contact resistances, considering the area density of the nanotubes, might be explained by the high cross-tube resistances at the contact interfaces...|$|R

The boat is capable of planing in modest winds downwind, and even on upwind the boat performs very well, in parity with much bigger 38-40 foot yachts.|$|E
50|$|Either Gregory did not {{understand}} Newton’s argument, or Newton’s explanation was very brief. However, it is possible, {{with a high degree}} of confidence, to construct Newton’s proof from Gregory’s notes, by analogy with his method to determine the solid of <b>minimum</b> <b>resistance</b> (Principia, Book 2, Proposition 34, Scholium 2). A detailed description of his solution of this latter problem is included in the draft of a letter in 1694, also to David Gregory.|$|E
50|$|Roots also rely on {{touch to}} {{navigate}} {{their way through}} the soil. Generally, roots have a negative touch response, meaning when they feel an object, they would grow away from the object. This allows the roots to go through the soil with <b>minimum</b> <b>resistance.</b> Because of this behavior, roots are said to be negatively thigmotropic. Thigmotropism seems to be able to override the strong gravitropic response of even primary roots. Charles Darwin performed experiments where he found that in a vertical bean root, a contact stimulus could divert the root away from the vertical.|$|E

50|$|Newton's minimal {{resistance}} {{problem is}} a problem of finding a solid of revolution which experiences a <b>minimum</b> <b>resistance</b> when it moves through the homogeneous fluid with constant velocity {{in the direction of the}} axis of revolution, named after Isaac Newton, who studied the problem in 1685 and published in 1687 in his Principia Mathematica. This problem is considered as one of the first problems solved in the calculus of variations, which appeared even before the brachistochrone problem. Newton published the solution in Principia Mathematica without his derivation and David Gregory was the first person who approached Newton and persuaded him to write an analysis for him. Then the derivation were shared to his students and peers by Gregory.|$|E
50|$|Varmint rifle bullets {{with thin}} jackets are {{intended}} to expand rapidly and disintegrate upon encountering <b>minimum</b> <b>resistance.</b> Bullets intended for big-game hunting are designed to increase their forward diameter while remaining intact to penetrate deeply enough to damage internal organs likely to cause rapid death. Big-game bullets sometimes have a specialized jacket including a center baffle between a forward core intended to expand and another core intended to remain intact. Alternative designs include a jacket with an internally thicker belt around {{the central part of}} the bullet intended to resist expansion while the thinner forward part of the bullet jacket ruptures. Some bullets have a core formed from a soft alloy in the forward part of the bullet bonded to a harder alloy core in the rear of the bullet. Others have a jacket which is thicker near the base of the bullet and tapers to a thin fringe adjacent to the soft point.|$|E
5000|$|The {{nominal power}} is the {{nameplate}} capacity of photovoltaic (PV) devices, such as solar cells, panels and systems, and is determined by measuring the electric current and voltage in a circuit, while varying the resistance under precisely defined conditions. These Standard Test Conditions (STC) are specified in standards such as IEC 61215, IEC 61646 and UL 1703; specifically the light intensity is 1000 W/m2, with a spectrum similar to sunlight hitting the earth's surface at latitude 35°N in the summer (airmass 1.5), {{the temperature of the}} cells being 25 °C. The power is measured while varying the resistive load on the module between an open and closed circuit (between maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>resistance).</b> The highest power thus measured is the 'nominal' power of the module in watts. This nominal power divided by the light power that falls on a given area of a photovoltaic device (area × 1000 W/m2) defines its efficiency, the ratio of the device's electrical output to the incident energy.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} if structural changes in forearm resistance vessels {{are associated with}} insulin resistance, we evaluated the relation between <b>minimum</b> forearm vascular <b>resistance</b> and insulin resistance in 95 obese adolescents before and after weight loss. Insulin resistance was assessed by fasting insulin levels and sum of insulin values after an oral glucose tolerance test in all 95 subjects and whole body glucose uptake during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia in 35 of 95 subjects. Structural changes in forearm vessels were assessed by measurement of <b>minimum</b> forearm vascular <b>resistance</b> during 10 minutes of ischemic exercise. As compared with our normal values, obese adolescents had a significantly (p< 0. 01) decreased maximal forearm blood flow (41. 6 ± 1. 4 versus 67. 1 + 2. 4 ml/min/ 100 ml) and increased <b>minimum</b> forearm vascular <b>resistance</b> (2. 9 ± 0. 4 versus 1. 6 ± 0. 7 mm Hg/ml/min/ 100 ml).
