50|$|The TRM-800 was a Hi-End {{solid state}} {{integrated}} stereo amplifier made in Japan, using NEC power transistors, by Nikko. It {{was the top}} of the line model in the Nikko amplifier range of TRM's series; beautifully housed in a wooden walnut-finished cabinet and a handsome brushed aluminum front panel, was introduced in 1975, the same year as the Marantz 2235. It was a 2 channel amp; however, it had three sets of speaker connections; those powered selected by buttons. At 8 ohms, the amp could put out 65 Watts per channel RMS (90 Watts per channel RMS at 4 ohms), delivering superb high fidelity sound with exceptional tone quality. Unlike many amps of this time, however, the TRM-800 was stable at lower impedances than 8 ohms; down to 4 ohms. The TRM-800's frequency response ranges 10Hz to 40.000 Hz ±1 dB with T.H.D. less than 0.1% at rated output. Its preamplifier and main amplifier were separable for <b>multi-channel</b> <b>amplifier</b> systems. The amp has internal circuit breakers which prevent it from clipping or overheating. Its power consumption is 250 watts. For equalization it has only a bass and a treble knob; however the frequency of these are selectable; between 250 and 500 Hertz for the bass, and between 2.5 and 5 kHz for the treble. It also has a high, low, and a subsonic filter. There are two excellent phono stages; phono 2 is provided with impedance matching selection, for using different types of cartridges(MC).|$|E

5000|$|One such {{source of}} ground noise is the {{isolated}} ground loop. The isolated ground loop {{differs from the}} ground loop in {{that there is no}} secondary connection to power supply ground or other non-signal ground. Instead two signal ground conductors (such as the outer conductor of stereo coaxial audio wire) are common at the amplifier input (by an internal connection in the <b>multi-channel</b> <b>amplifier),</b> they travel some distance whereupon they experience different induction currents and then are made common at some other secondary location (typically a multi-channel signal source device), as in stereo patch cords. The induction currents being different for each of the two outer coaxial conductors set up a current between the two which results in a difference in potential appearing at the negative input terminals at the amplifier, with respect to the positive input terminals. The problem is made worse by the increasing the length of the cables, and their proximity to devices radiating magnetic noise. One solution to this problem incorporates the use of a single ground conductor as a shield (see coax) and the use of multiple other separated internal conductors as positive signal wires inside a single shield conductor, allowing for several separate and distinct positive signals to all arrive at the amplifier input referenced to a single ground shield conductor. This method also insures that all the signal conductors and the single ground shield conductor (like coax) all experience similar induction of unwanted signals. Another solution is the incorporation of [...] "star topology" [...] signal grounding technique wherein no signal ground ever connects to any other signal ground, except at a single centralized location.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{design and}} test a {{wideband}} <b>multi-channel</b> <b>amplifier</b> system for time reversal (TR) microwave hyperthermia, {{operating in the}} frequency range 300 MHz- 1 GHz, enabling operation in both pulsed and continuous wave regimes. This is to experimentally verify that adaptation of the heating pattern with respect to tumour size can be realised by varying the operating frequency of the antennas and potentially by using Ultra-wideband (UWB) pulse sequences instead of pure harmonic signals. Materials and methods: The proposed system consists of 12 identical channels driven by a common reference signal. The power and phase settings are applied with resolutions of 0. 1 W and 0. 1 degrees, respectively. Using a calibration procedure, the measured output characteristics of each channel are interpolated using polynomial functions, which are then implemented into a system software algorithm driving the system feedback loop. Results: The maximum output power capability of the system varies with frequency, between 90 and 135 W with a relative power error of +/- 6 %. A phase error {{in the order of}} +/- 4 degrees has been achieved within the entire frequency band. Conclusions: The developed amplifier system prototype is capable of accurate power and phase delivery, over the entire frequency band of the system. The output power of the present system allows for an experimental verification of a recently developed TR-method on phantoms or animals. The system is suitable for further development for head and neck tumours, breast or extremity applications...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: For our head-and-neck {{hyperthermia}} (HT) applicator, an amplifier {{system with}} full amplitude and phase-control {{to deliver the}} radio-frequency signals, was not available. We therefore designed and tested a 433. 92 MHz <b>multi-channel</b> <b>amplifier</b> system. System description: The design consists of a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) system that generates 12 phase-controlled coherent 433. 92 MHz signals, which are amplified to maximum 200 W output per channel. Directional couplers are placed at the amplifiers to couple {{a small portion of}} both forward and reflected signals to gain-and-phase detectors. The power setting is applied with a resolution of 2 W and for the phase it is 0. 1 degrees. The channels are sequentially sampled at 100 Hz per channel. Methods: We tested the performance of the designed amplifier system by measuring the RF spectrum, power and phase accuracy, and by characterising the feedback control by using highly accurate power and phase meters. Results: The spurious emission is less than 60 dBc and the first two harmonic frequencies are suppressed more than 45 dB. The measurement accuracy for the power (+/- 5 %) is valid for at least 20 days after calibration and for the phase (+/- 5 degrees) it is valid for at least 2 months. Conclusions: The amplifier system operates according to our design criteria to support targeted HT. It can be used for both our in-house developed superficial and head-and-neck HT applicators or any other HT applicator that works on the same frequency of 433. 92 MHz...|$|E

40|$|Here we {{describe}} a methodological approach for the simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) recording in musicians playing in ensemble. Four professional saxophonists wore pre-wired EEG caps (30 electrodes placed {{according to an}} augmented 10 - 20 system; cephalic reference and ground). Each cap was connected to a single <b>multi-channel</b> <b>amplifier</b> box [Brain Explorer (BE), EB-Neuro (c) ]. The four boxes converged to a single workstation equipped with a software (GALILEO NT, EB-Neuro (c)) allowing the simultaneous recording of sounds, digital trigger, and EEG-electrooculographic (EOG) -electromyographic (EMG) data, and providing a separate output file for each individual. Noteworthy, the subjects were electrically decoupled to satisfy international safety guidelines. The quality of the EEG data was confirmed by the rate of artifact-free EEG epochs (about 80 %) and by EEG spectral features. During the resting state, dominant EEG power density values were observed at alpha band (8 - 12 Hz) in posterior cortex. The quality of EMG {{can be used to}} identify "on" and "off" states of the musicians' motor performance, thus potentially allowing the investigation of the relationships between EEG dynamics and different characteristics of the specific performance. During the music performance, alpha power density values decreased in amplitude in several cortical regions, whereas power density values enhanced within narrow high-frequency bands. In conclusion, the present methodological approach appeared to be suitable for simultaneous EEG recordings in musicians playing in ensemble. (C) 2011 Elsevier Srl. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|While much {{progress}} has been made in various fields of study in past few decades, leading to better understanding of science as well as better quality of life, the role of optical sensing has grown among electrical, chemical, optical, and other physical signal modalities. As an example, fluorescent microscopy has become one of the most important methods in the modern biology. However, broader implementation of optical sensing has been limited due to the expensive and bulky optical and mechanical components of conventional optical sensor systems. To address such bottleneck, this dissertation presents several cost-effective, compact approaches of optical sensor arrays based on solid state devices that can replace the conventional components. As an example, in chapter 2 we demonstrate a chip-scale (< 1 mm 2) sensor, the Planar Fourier Capture Array (PFCA), capable of imaging the far-field without any off-chip optics. The PFCA consists of an array of angle-sensitive pixels manufactured in a standard semiconductor process, each of which reports one component of a spatial two-dimensional (2 D) Fourier transform of the local light field. Thus, the sensor directly captures 2 D Fourier transforms of scenes. The effective resolution of our prototype is approximately 400 pixels. My work on this project [15] includes a circuit design and layout and the overall testing of the imaging system. In chapter 3 we present a fully integrated, Single Photon Avalanche Detector (SPAD) using only standard low- voltage (1. 8 V) CMOS devices in a 0. 18 m process. The system requires one highvoltage AC signal which alternately reverse biases the SPADs into avalanche breakdown and then resets with a forward bias. The proposed self-quenching circuit intrinsically suppresses after-pulse effects, improving signal to noise ratio while still permitting fine time resolution. The required high-voltage AC signal can be generated by resonant structures and can be shared across arrays of SPADs [24]. An ideal light sensor to provide the precise incident intensity, location, and angle of incoming photons is shown in chapter 4. Single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) provide such desired high (single photon) sensitivity with precise time information, and can be implemented at a pixel scale to form an array to extract spatial information. Furthermore, recent work has demonstrated photodiode-based structures (combined with micro-lenses and diffraction gratings) that are capable of encoding both spatial and angular information of the incident light. In this chapter, we describe the implementation of such grating structure on SPAD to realize a pixel-scale angle-sensitive single photon avalanche diode (A-SPAD) using a standard CMOS process. While the underlying SPAD structure provides the high sensitivity, the diffraction gratings consisting of two sets of metal layers offers the angle-sensitivity. Such unique combination of the SPAD and the diffraction gratings expand the sensing dimensions to pave a path towards a lens-less 3 -D imaging and a light-field timeof-flight imaging. In chapter 5, we present a 72 x 60, angle-sensitive single photon avalanche diode (A-SPAD) array for lens-less 3 -D fluorescent life time imaging. A-SPAD pixels are comprised of (1) a SPAD to resolve precise timing information, to reject high-powered UV stimulus, and to map the lifetimes of different fluorescent sources and (2) integrated diffraction gratings on top of the SPAD to extract incident angles of incoming light, enabling 3 -D localization at a micrometer scale. The chip presented in this work also integrates pixel-level counters as well as shared timing circuitry, and is implemented in conventional 180 nm CMOS technology without any post-processing. Contact-based read- out from a revolving MEMS accelerometers is problematic therefore contactless (optical) read-out is preferred. The optical readout requires an image sensor to resolve nanometer-scale shifts of the MEMS image. Traditional imagers record on a rectangular grid which is not well-suited for efficiently imaging rotating objects due to the significant processing overhead required to translate Cartesian coordinates to angular position. Therefore, in chapter 6 we demonstrate a high-speed (1 kfps), circular, CMOS imaging array for contact-less, optical measurement of rotating inertial sensors. The imager is designed for real-time optical readout and calibration of a MEMS accelerometer revolving at greater than 1000 rpm. The imager uses a uniform circular arrangement of pixels to enable rapid imaging of rotational objects. Furthermore, each photodiode itself is circular to maintain uniform response throughout the entire revolution. Combining a high frame rate and a uniform response to motion, the imager can achieve sub-pixel resolution (25 nm) of the displacement of micro scale features. In order to avoid fixed pattern noise arising from non-uniform routing within the array we implemented a new global shutter technique that is insensitive to parasitic capacitance. To ease integration with various MEMS platforms, the system has SPI control, on-chip bias generation, sub-array imaging, and digital data read-out. My work on this project [20] includes a circuit design and lay- out and some testing including, a FPGA based controller design of the imaging system. In the previous chapters, compact and cost effective imaging sys- tems have been introduced. Those imaging systems show great potential for wireless implantable systems. A power rectifier for the implant provides a volt- age DC power with a small inductor, for small volume, from a small AC voltage input. In the last chapter we demonstrate an inductively powered, orthogonal current-reuse <b>multi-channel</b> <b>amplifier</b> for power-efficient neural recording. The power rectifier uses the input swing as a self-synchronous charge pump, making it a fully passive, full-wave ladder rectifier. The rectifier supplies 10. 37 [MICRO SIGN]W at 1. 224 V to the <b>multi-channel</b> <b>amplifier,</b> which includes bias generation. The prototype device is fabricated in a TSMC 65 nm CMOS process, with an active area of 0. 107 mm 2. The maximum measured power conversion efficiency (PCE) is 16. 58 % with a 184 mV input amplitude.

40|$|Recently, {{high-density}} surface EMG electrode grids and <b>multi-channel</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{became available}} for non-invasive recording of human motor units (MUs). We present {{a way to}} decompose surface EMG signals into MU firing patterns, whereby we concentrate {{on the importance of}} two-dimensional spatial differences between the MU action potentials (MUAPs). Our method is exemplified with high-density EMG data from the vastus lateralis muscle of a single subject. Bipolar and Laplacian spatial filtering was applied to the monopolar raw signals. From the single recording in this subject six different simultaneously active MUs could be distinguished using the spatial differences between MUAPs in the direction perpendicular to the muscle fiber direction. After spike-triggered averaging, 125 -channel two-dimensional MUAP templates were obtained. Template-matching allowed tracking of all MU firings. The impact of spatial information was measured by using subsets of the MUAP templates, either in parallel or perpendicular to the muscle fiber direction. The use of one-dimensional spatial information perpendicular to the muscle fiber direction was superior to the use of a linear array electrode in the longitudinal direction. However, to detect the firing events of the MUs with a high accuracy, as needed for instance for estimation of firing synchrony, two-dimensional information from the complete grid electrode appears essential...|$|R

This paper reports a novel method for simultaneous resonance monitoring of MEMS cantilevers using phase based dynamic measurements without any electrical connections to the sensor array. MEMS cantilevers are made of electroplated nickel and actuated remotely with magnetic field using an electro-coil. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of simultaneous parallel optical monitoring of dynamic mode micro-cantilever array in liquid environment. Illumination is generated using a laser source and a diffractive pattern generator, which provides 500 μW laser power per channel. A compact fiber array based pick-up was built for optical readout. Its main advantages are easy customization to different size and pitch of sensor array, and good immunity to electrical noise and magnetic interference as the photo detectors are located away from the electro-coil. The resonant frequency of the cantilever is tracked with a custom <b>multi-channel</b> lock-in <b>amplifier</b> implemented in software. For demonstrating the stability and sensitivity of the system we performed measurements using glycerol solutions with different viscosities. Measured phase sensitivity was 0. 9 °/ 1 % of Glycerol/DI-water solution and the standard deviation of measured phase was 0. 025 °. The resulting detection limit for Glycerol/DI-water solution was 280 ppm. The proposed method showed robust results with low laser power and very good noise immunity to interference signals and environmental vibrations. The sensor technology demonstrated here is very significant as it is scalable to larger arrays for simultaneous and real- time monitoring of multiple biological and chemical agents during fluid flow.

5000|$|The 'second wave' {{of sound}} {{recording}} history was ushered {{in by the}} introduction of Western Electric's integrated system of electrical microphones, electronic signal amplifiers and electromechanical recorders, which was adopted by major US record labels in 1925. Sound recording now became a hybrid process — sound could now be captured, amplified, filtered and balanced electronically, and the disc-cutting head was now electrically powered, but the actual recording process remained essentially mechanical - the signal was still physically inscribed into a wax 'master' disc, and consumer discs were mass-produced mechanically by stamping a metal electroform made from the wax master into a suitable substance, originally a shellac-based compound and later polyvinyl plastic. The Western Electric system greatly improved the fidelity of sound recording, increasing the reproducible frequency range to a much wider band (between 60 Hz and 6000 Hz) and allowing a new class of professional - the audio engineer - to capture a fuller, richer and more detailed and balanced sound on record, using multiple microphones connected to <b>multi-channel</b> electronic <b>amplifiers,</b> compressors, filters and mixers. Electrical microphones led to a dramatic change in the performance style of singers, ushering {{in the age of the}} [...] "crooner", while electronic amplification had a wide-ranging impact in many areas, enabling the development of broadcast radio, public address systems, and electronically-amplified home record players. In addition, the development of electronic amplifiers for musical instruments now enabled quieter instruments such as the guitar and the string bass to compete on equal terms with the naturally louder wind and horn instruments, and musicians and composers also began to experiment with entirely new electronic musical instruments such as the Theremin, the Ondes Martenot, the electronic organ, and the Hammond Novachord, the world's first analogue polyphonic synthesiser.|$|R
40|$|Focused {{ultrasound}} {{is currently}} being developed as a non-invasive thermal ablation technique for benign and cancerous tumors in several organ systems. Although these therapies are designed to ablate tissue purely by thermal means, cavitation, the formation and collapse of gas bubbles, can occur. These bubbles can be unpredictable in their timing and location and often interfere with thermal therapies. Therefore, focused ultrasound techniques have tried to avoid bubbles and their effects. However, gas bubbles in vivo have some potential useful features for therapy. They greatly enhance local ultrasound absorption, and can on their own induce mechanical damage to the tissue. In addition, bubble clouds can block ultrasound wave propagation, providing a means to protect vital tissues during ablation of nearby pathology. If induced and controlled properly, cavitation in focused ultrasound therapy could potentially be very beneficial. The first aim {{of this research is}} to design and test in vivo ultrasound exposures that induce cavitation at appropriate times and take advantage of their absorption enhancing properties. In addition, methods to monitor and control cavitation induction and the associated therapy will be investigated. Second, a theoretical bubble model and acoustic field simulations will be used to design optimal pressure fields which very tightly control the cavitation location. These models will also be used to investigate methods for reducing the acoustic powers needed to induce cavitation while preventing off focus cavitation. For the final phase of the research a <b>multi-channel,</b> multi-frequency ultrasound <b>amplifier</b> system capable of delivering optimal exposures via large scale phased array systems will be developed and tested.

It is therefore important {{to be able to}} detect, identify and quantify the presence of a gas especially when its presence could lead to a fatal situation. The use of small and sensitive sensors can allow for the placement of these devices over a large area, thus allowing for a more precise and timely determination of a gas leak. ASRC Aerospace and its research partners are developing nano sensors for detection of various gases, including but not limited to: H 2, NH 3, N 2 O 4, hydrazine and others. Initial laboratory testing has demonstrated the capability to detect the gases in concentrations lower than parts per million. Testing and development is continuing to improve the response and recovery times, to increase the sensitivity of the devices. Different coatings and electrodes are currently being evaluated to determine the optimum configuration of a variety of gases. The small footprint of the Nano sensors allows for several devices, each responsive in a different way to different gases, to be placed into a single substrate. Multiple devices embedded into a single substrate results in increased reliability and in a decrease for periodic calibrations. The use of different coatings will result in a small electronic nose capable of distinguishing between different gases.
