We investigate the statistics of the angle of deviation phi between the particle and fluid velocities.

40|$|We uncover {{universal}} statistical {{properties of}} the trajectories of heavy inertial particles in three-dimensional, statistically steady, homogeneous, and isotropic turbulent flows by extensive direct numerical simulations. We show that the probability distribution functions (PDFs) P(ϕ), of the angle ϕ between the Eulerian velocity u and the particle velocity v, {{at this point and}} time, shows a power-law region in which P(ϕ) ∼ϕ^-γ, with a new universal exponent γ≃ 4.

40|$|In a {{torsion spring}} the spring {{action is a}} result of the {{relationships}} between the torque applied in twisting the spring, the angle through which the torsion spring twists, and the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> elasticity of the spring material in shear. Torsion springs employed industrially have been strips, rods, or bars, generally termed shafts, capabable of being flexed by twisting their axes. They rely on the variations in shearing forces to furnish an internal restoring torque. In the torsion springs herein the restoring torque is external and therefore independent <b>of</b> the shearing <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> elasticity <b>of</b> the <b>torsion</b> spring shaft.

We have constructed a triple compound oscillator with distinct normal modes.
