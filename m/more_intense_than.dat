Unlike most murids, copulatory behavior lacks intravaginal thrusting, the intromission thrust is <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> <b>than</b> the dismount, there is no lock, and ejaculation occurs with every thrust.|$|E
5|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the New York City Subway {{produces}} {{high levels of}} noise that exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health found noise levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94dB on platforms. Daily exposure to noise at such levels {{for as little as}} 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, noise exposure at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes. A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of Washington found higher average noise levels in the subway (80.4dB) than on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4dB), Metro-North (75.1dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9dB). Since the decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, sound at 95dB is 10 times <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> <b>than</b> at 85dB, 100 times <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> <b>than</b> at 75dB, and so forth. In the second study, peak subway noise registered at 102.1dB.|$|E
5|$|The minimum central {{pressure}} of these storms is, {{for the most}} part, estimated from satellite imagery using the Dvorak technique. In the case of Kenna, Ava, and Patricia, the central pressure was measured by hurricane hunter aircraft flying into the storm.

5|$|After initial preparations, the Americans and French {{built their}} first {{parallel}} {{and began the}} bombardment. With the British defense weakened, on October 14, 1781 Washington sent two columns to attack the last major remaining British outer defenses. A French column took Redoubt No. 9 and an American column took Redoubt No. 10. With these defenses taken, the allies were able to finish their second parallel. With the American artillery closer and its bombardment <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> <b>than</b> ever, the British position began to deteriorate rapidly and Cornwallis asked for capitulation terms on October 17. After two days of negotiation, the surrender ceremony occurred on October 19; Lord Cornwallis was absent from the ceremony. With the capture of more than 7,000 British soldiers, negotiations between the United States and Great Britain began, resulting in the Treaty of Paris of 1783.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of the {{interaction}} between energetic photons and hadrons show that {{the interaction}} is much <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> <b>than</b> expected by the interaction of merely photons with the hadron's electric charge. Furthermore, the interaction of energetic photons with protons is similar to the interaction of photons with neutrons {{in spite of the fact}} that the electric charge structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different. A theory called Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) was developed to explain this effect. According to VMD, the photon is a superposition of the pure electromagnetic photon which interacts only with electric charges and vector meson. However, if experimentally probed at very short distances, the intrinsic structure of the photon is recognized as a flux of quark and gluon components, quasi-free according to asymptotic freedom in QCD and described by the photon structure function. A comprehensive comparison of data with theoretical predictions was presented in a review in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that a cycle occurs in which {{volcanic}} activity at the summit is dominant for several hundred years, after which activity shifts to the rift zones for several more centuries, {{and then back to}} the summit again. Two cycles have been clearly identified, each lasting 1,500–2,000years. This cyclical behavior is unique to Mauna Loa among the Hawaiian volcanoes. Between about 7,000 and 6,000years ago Mauna Loa was largely inactive. The cause of this cessation in activity is not known, and no known similar hiatus has been found at other Hawaiian volcanoes except for those currently in the post-shield stage. Between 11,000 and 8,000years ago, activity was <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> <b>than</b> it is today. However, Mauna Loa's overall rate of growth has probably begun to slow over the last 100,000years, and the volcano may in fact be nearing the end of its tholeiitic basalt shield-building phase.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{still had}} considerable strength when it entered southeastern Georgia. The winds brought down telephone, telegraph, and electric wires throughout the region, severing communications. Damage in the Sea Islands was extensive, costing an estimated $500,000; by some accounts, the winds were <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> <b>than</b> in the catastrophic hurricane of 1893, {{but without the}} exceptionally high storm surge. The tropical cyclone caused severe damage to the islands' plantations, ruining around {{a third of the}} rice crop, devastating the cotton crop, and killing up to 100 people. Charlton and Camden counties bore the brunt of the storm's force in Georgia, as evidenced by the complete clearing of dense pine forests east of Folkston. This dealt a $500,000 blow to the turpentine industry. Many structures in Folkston were destroyed, including multiple churches, a courthouse, and a school that collapsed with 38 students inside, all of whom safely escaped. In small communities throughout extreme southeastern Georgia, the storm caused widespread destruction of homes and businesses. Six people in Camden County were killed, including four in a logging settlement that was ravaged near the Florida border.|$|E
25|$|Initially, gamma {{radiation}} from the fission products of an equivalent size fission-fusion-fission bomb are much <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> <b>than</b> Co-60: 15,000 times more intense at 1 hour; 35 times more intense at 1 week; 5 times more intense at 1 month; and about equal at 6 months. Thereafter fission drops off rapidly so that Co-60 fallout is 8 times <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> <b>than</b> fission at 1 year and 150 times more intense at 5 years. The very long-lived isotopes produced by fission would overtake the 60Co again after about 75 years.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if MBT, Skechers Shape-Ups, or Reebok's EasyTone shoes provide walkers with a <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> workout <b>than</b> New Balance walking shoes. Subjects included 12 physically active women ranging from 19 to 24 years of age. Each subject completed 12, 5 -minute exercise bouts. The exercise bouts were completed while wearing the four different types of shoes at three different workloads: 3. 0 mph/ 0 % grade, 3. 5 mph/ 0 % grade, and 3. 5 mph/ 5. 0 % grade. There was no significant difference in RPE, VO 2, HR, or caloric expenditure between shoe conditions. The results of his study indicate that there is no evidence that fitness shoes provide users with a <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> workout <b>than</b> regular walking shoes...|$|R

25|$|Aristippus of Cyrene, a pupil of Socrates, founded {{an early}} Socratic school that {{emphasized}} {{only one side}} of Socrates's teachings - that happiness {{is one of the}} ends of moral action and that pleasure is the supreme good; thus a hedonistic world view, wherein bodily gratification is <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> <b>than</b> mental pleasure. Cyrenaics prefer immediate gratification to the long-term gain of delayed gratification; denial is unpleasant unhappiness.|$|E
25|$|Relationships {{in virtual}} worlds have an added {{dimension}} {{compared to other}} social media, because avatars give a feeling of proximity making the voyeur experience <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> <b>than</b> simply a textual encounter.

25|$|Peer {{groups are}} {{essential}} to social and general development.

25|$|Positive {{lightning}} strikes {{tend to be}} much <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> <b>than</b> their negative counterparts. An average bolt of negative lightning carries an electric current of 30,000 amperes (30 kA), and transfers 15 coulombs of electric charge and 500 megajoules of energy. Large bolts of negative lightning can carry up to 120 kA and 350 coulombs. The average positive ground flash has roughly double the peak current of a typical negative flash, and can produce peak currents up to 400,000 amperes (400 kA) and charges of several hundreds coulombs. Furthermore, positive ground flashes with high peak currents are commonly followed by long continuing currents, a correlation not seen in negative ground flashes.|$|E
