50|$|Every cell is {{assigned}} a Cell Allocation (CA) Table. This is {{the set of}} ARFCNs that are used within the Cell. The <b>Mobile</b> <b>Allocation</b> (MA) Table is a subset of this CA Table. This table contains a list of ARFCNs that the traffic channels of that cell will hop through. The MAIO gives the index into this list from which the first ARFCN will be picked by the cell to start the hopping sequence. Every mobile station will be supplied with the MA Table and MAIO for a given dedicated connection. Using the MA table and the MAIO, the mobile station will hop in the exact sequence as the cell in dedicated mode to achieve frequency diversity. Thus, the MA Table, MAIO and the Hopping Sequence Number (HSN) completely configure a hopping sequence procedure which the mobile station and the cell will follow.|$|E
40|$|Spectrum {{allocation}} is {{once more}} {{a key issue}} facing the global telecommunications industry. Largely overlooked in current debates, however, is the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC). Decisions taken by WRC shape the future roadmap of the telecommunications industry, not least because it {{has the ability to}} shape the global spectrum allocation framework. In the debates of WRC- 12 it is possible to identify three main issues: enhancement of the international spectrum regulatory framework, regulatory measures required to introduce Cognitive Radio Systems (CRS) technologies; and, additional spectrum allocation to mobile service. WRC- 12 eventually decided not to change the current international radio regulations with regard to the first two issues and agreed to the third issue. The main implications of WRC- 12 on the spectrum ecosystem are that most of actors are not in support of the concept of spectrum flexibility associated with trading and that the concept of spectrum open access is not under consideration. This is explained by the observation that spectrum trading and spectrum commons weaken state control over spectrum and challenge the main principles and norms of the international spectrum management regime. In addition, the <b>mobile</b> <b>allocation</b> issue has shown the lack of conformity with the main rules of the regime: regional spectrum allocation in the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) three regions, and the resistance to the slow decision making procedures. In conclusion, while the rules and decision-making procedures of the international spectrum management regime were challenged in the WRC- 12, the main principles and norms are still accepted by the majority of countries...|$|E

40|$|The {{practice}} of TV white spaces (TVWS), one {{application of the}} easement approach to spectrum management, has varied {{around the world with}} limited commercial deployments and only a few trials due mainly to the delay in digital switchover and the resistance of broadcasters. Internationally the ITU-R has discussed, at the World Radiocommunication Conference of 2012 (WRC- 12), the regulatory measures that can enable deployment of cognitive radio systems (CRS). Following WRC- 12, the ITU-R has started to discuss TVWS among other dynamic spectrum access (DSA) techniques. The examination of the influence of the international spectrum regime on national spectrum policy reform, from command and control towards spectrum easements approach is based on data collected from 84 interviews and shows that the international regime does not prevent adopting opportunistic access in the TVWS. However, there are different elements of flexibility (support) and restriction (opposition) that have an influence on a regulator's decision regarding the deployment of such a concept. These elements are dependent on a country's relationship with its neighbours, the perception of the TVWS concept and the interpretation of the ITU-R Radio Regulations (RR). There are four different perceptions on the TVWS radiocommunication service status: secondary, non-interference basis, primary, and different status according to the perceived operation of TVWS. There are contrasting perceptions on the influence of WRC- 12 decision on CRS regarding TVWS adoption. There are two distinct views on the need for particular measures similar to those adopted for WLAN in the 5 GHz for TVWS such as dynamic frequency selection (DFS). This is based on the perception of TVWS service status, deficiencies of TVWS, deficiencies of DFS, difference between operation of WLAN and TVWS and positive influence of such measures on the TVWS adoption. Finally, it is argued that the TVWS proponents were quite unlucky in terms of the timing of its deployment due to the consecutive <b>mobile</b> <b>allocations</b> in the 800 MHz, 700 MHz, 470 - 694 MHz spectrum bands by the WRC- 07, WRC- 12, and WRC- 15 respectively.

40|$|Most {{interactive}} tasks engage {{more than}} one of the userâ€™s exteroceptive senses and are therefore multimodal. In real-world situations with multitasking and distractions, the key aspect of multimodality is not which modalities can be allocated to the interactive task but which are free to be allocated to something else. We present the multimodal flexibility index (MFI), calculated from changes in usersâ€™ performance induced by blocking of sensory modalities. A high score indicates that the highest level of performance is achievable regardless of the modalities available and, conversely, a low score that performance will be severely hampered unless all modalities are allocated to the task.

Even with the deployment of advanced mobile data networks such as HSPA and LTE, many mobile operators {{around the world are}} still experiencing challenges in fulfilling the ever increasing bandwidth demands. While the obvious bottleneck is in the network infrastructure â€“ limited number of cells and bandwidth, {{it is not the only}} bottleneck. Paradoxically, existing mobile networks may in fact be under-utilized from time to time. This seemingly contradicting observation is due to TCPâ€™s inability to utilize all the bandwidth available. This work investigates this problem by developing a stochastic model to relate the systemâ€™s service response time to TCPâ€™s protocol efficiency, and to quantify the networkâ€™s capacity loss due to TCP. Using real-world network parameters the model revealed that network capacity loss is surprisingly high at typical traffic loads. More interestingly, the results uncovered the inter-play between network capacity loss and protocol/channel bandwidth limits, which opens up a new dimension to the optimization of <b>mobile</b> cell bandwidth <b>allocation...</b>|$|R

Additionally, if the channel noise is a random variable, either bandwidth or power levels can be assigned in an optimised way. For all three cases, the optimum schedule of resource allocation is derived including which sources are to be encoded and transmitted. Additionally, performance bounds on the distortion are derived for systems with large number of users.

This paper refers to a cellular system transmitting layered multicast services to a multicast group of users. Reliability of communications is ensured via different Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) tech-niques. We deal with a fundamental problem: the computational complexity of the RLNC decoder. The higher the number of decoding operations is, the more the userâ€™s computational over-head grows and, consequently, the faster the battery of mobile devices drains. By referring to several sparse RLNC techniques, and without any assumption on the implementation of the RLNC decoder in use, we provide an efficient way to characterize the performance of users targeted by ultra-reliable layered multicast services. The proposed modeling allows to efficiently derive the average number of coded packet transmissions needed to recover one or more service layers. We design a convex resource allocation framework that allows to minimize the complexity of the RLNC decoder by jointly optimizing the transmission parameters and the sparsity of the code. The designed optimization framework also ensures service guarantees to predetermined fractions of users. The performance of the proposed optimization framework is then investigated in a LTE-A eMBMS network multicasting H. 264 /SVC video services.
