60|$|The {{skeleton}} {{of the foot}} is very {{like that of the}} hand in some respects. Thus there are three phalanges in each of the lesser toes, and only two in the great toe, which answers to the thumb. There is a long bone, termed 'metatarsal', answering to the metacarpal, for each digit; and the 'tarsus', which corresponds with the carpus, presents four short polygonal bones in a row, which correspond very closely with the four carpal bones of the second row of the hand. In other respects the foot differs very widely from the hand. Thus the great toe is the longest digit but one; and its metatarsal is far less <b>moveably</b> articulated with the tarsus, than the metacarpal of the thumb with the carpus. But a far more important distinction lies in the fact that, instead of four more tarsal bones there are only three; and, that these three are not arranged side by side, or in one row. One of them, the 'os calcis' or heel bone ('ca'), lies externally, and sends back the large projecting heel; another, the 'astragalus' ('as'), rests on this by one face, and by another, forms, with the bones of the leg, the ankle joint; while a third face, directed forwards, is separated from the three inner tarsal bones of the row next the metatarsus by a bone called the 'scaphoid' ('sc').|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a rollator (1) having a frame (2, 3), front wheels (4) and back wheels (5), and further comprising handles (6) that {{are connected to}} the frame (2, 3), wherein the frame (2, 3) comprises a first frame part (2) and a second frame part (3), which frame parts (2, 3) are <b>moveably</b> connected to each other between a first predetermined position at which the front wheels (4) are at a first distance from the back wheels (5), and a second predetermined position at which the front wheels (4) are at a second distance from the back wheels (5), wherein the first distance is larger than the second distance.

40|$|A passive capture joint {{with three}} {{degrees of freedom}} is {{presented}} wherein two structural elements are joined together solely by moving the two elements into position, and which when joined together have rotation in all three axes. The inventive apparatus is comprised of two halves: (1) a joint ball mounted on a stem as in a common trailer hitch, and; (2) a socket. The socket consists of a base having an exterior wall and forming an interior chamber, the chamber having a top end and a bottom end, and an interior wall. The chamber is open at the top end, and forms a spherical cup at the bottom end. The socket base's interior chamber is sized to accept the joint ball. The base also forms at least one bore at an acute angle away from the interior chamber's open end. The bores have a first opening in the interior wall of the chamber, and a second opening in the exterior wall of the base. Retaining balls sized to fit within the bores, but to only partially pass through the first opening, are <b>moveably</b> housed within the bores. The retaining balls are <b>moveably</b> held in the first opening by a compression spring housed in the bore. As the joint ball is inserted in the chamber it forces the retaining balls back into the bore until the equator of the joint ball passes. Because the bore is at an acute angle to the chamber the joint ball cannot exit the chamber without the joint being unlocked. The joint is unlocked by rotating a locking ring which encircles the base and covers the second opening. The locking ring has a radial slot for each retaining ball, disposed angularly from the base, and sized to allow passage of the retaining ball in the radial direction when the locking ring is rotated to align the radial slot with the second opening...|$|E
40|$|An {{immersive}} cyberspace {{system is}} presented which provides visual, audible, and vibrational inputs to a subject remaining in neutral immersion, and also provides for subject control input. The immersive cyberspace system includes a relaxation chair and a neutral immersion display hood. The relaxation chair supports a subject positioned thereupon, and places {{the subject in}} position which merges a neutral body position, the position a body naturally assumes in zero gravity, with a savasana yoga position. The display hood, which covers the subject's head, is configured to produce light images and sounds. An image projection subsystem provides either external or internal image projection. The display hood includes a projection screen <b>moveably</b> attached to an opaque shroud. A motion base supports the relaxation chair and produces vibrational inputs over a range of about 0 - 30 Hz. The motion base also produces limited translation and rotational movements of the relaxation chair. These limited translational and rotational movements, when properly coordinated with visual stimuli, constitute motion cues which create sensations of pitch, yaw, and roll movements. Vibration transducers produce vibrational inputs from about 20 Hz to about 150 Hz. An external computer, coupled to various components of the immersive cyberspace system, executes a software program and creates the cyberspace environment. One or more neutral hand posture controllers may be coupled to the external computer system and used to control {{various aspects of the}} cyberspace environment, or to enter data during the cyberspace experience...|$|E
40|$|An auto-adjusting {{pin tool}} for {{friction}} stir welding is presented wherein the pin tool automatically adjusts for welding materials of varying thicknesses, and the pin can be incrementally withdrawn from the workpieces thus eliminating any crater or keyhole in the weld. The inventive apparatus is comprised of a welding head housing a motor connected to a controller instrument package and an arbor supported by bearings. The arbor forms an interior cylinder and is encircled by a stationary slip ring though which are ported hydraulic passageways into the interior cylinder of the arbor such that a piston housed therein may be moved axially. Coupled to the piston is a pin tool which is treaded on its lower end and which is <b>moveably</b> seated in, and extending through, a shoulder housing having concave lower face. When welding, the rotating treaded end of the pin enters and stirs the workpieces while the lower face of the shoulder housing compacts the workpieces. As the welding head traverses the shoulder housing the controller senses any rising pressure on the lower face of the shoulder housing and withdraws the arbor to keep the pressure constant. At the same time, the piston moves towards the workpieces thus extending the pin further from the shoulder. This keeps the pin at a proper depth in the workpieces regardless of their thicknesses. As the weld terminates this same operation {{can be used to}} incrementally withdraw the pin during the final part of the traverse, thus eliminating any keyhole or crater that would otherwise be created...|$|E
