40|$|Breeding for <b>malting</b> <b>quality</b> is an {{important}} goal of malting barley breeding programs. <b>Malting</b> <b>quality</b> is a complex phenotype that combines {{a large number of}} interrelated components, each of which shows complex inheritance. Currently, only a few genes involved in determining <b>malting</b> <b>quality</b> have been characterized. We combined transcript profiling with phenotypic correlations to identify candidate genes for <b>malting</b> <b>quality.</b> The Barley 1 GeneChip® array containing 22, 792 probe sets was used to conduct transcript profiling of genes expressed in several different stages of malting of four malting cultivars. Genes that were differentially expressed in comparisons between different malting stages relative to ungerminated seed, as well as in comparisons between malting cultivars in the same malting stage were identified. Correlation analysis of 723 differentially expressed genes with <b>malting</b> <b>quality</b> phenotypes showed that 11 – 102 of these genes correlated with six <b>malting</b> <b>quality</b> phenotypes. Genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were among the positively correlated genes. Genes for protein and lipid metabolism, cell wall organization and biogenesis, and genes involved in stress and defense response also correlated with <b>malting</b> <b>quality</b> phenotypes.

The aim of the current project is to introduce key <b>malt</b> <b>quality</b> genes from the malting varieties via MAS, while maintaining the superior adaptation and agronomic profile of the feed barley. This strategy involves using Keel, a well adapted Australian feed variety as the recurrent parent to produce backcross lines from three international malting varieties, Alexis, Haruna Nijo and AC Metcalfe. The BC 1 and BC 2 generations for each of three introgression streams (one for each donor parent) have been screened using molecular markers to select for <b>malt</b> <b>quality</b> loci from the donor.

40|$|In the {{development}} of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars for malting purposes, it is usually not possible to select for <b>malt</b> <b>quality</b> characteristics in early generations {{because of the high}} cost associated with micromalting large numbers of grain samples and assessing quality traits on the resulting malt samples and because of the sensitivity of quantitative <b>malt</b> <b>quality</b> traits to environmental variation. Thus, barley malting quality may be a good candidate for marker-assisted selection. Here, the objective was to use marker-based selection to manipulate a <b>malt</b> <b>quality</b> characteristic, -amylase activity, in a barley breeding population. Marker-based selection was applied among F₂:₃ lines from the cross ‘Morex’/‘Labelle’, targeting Morex alleles in a region of chromosome 7 (5 H) that had previously been found to affect -amylase activity in the cross ‘Steptoe’/Morex. The target region was represented by two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers. Selected lines were grown in field plots in two years. Agronomic and grain quality data were measured. Grain samples were micromalted and assessed for <b>malt</b> <b>quality</b> traits. Selection for the Morex allele at two PCR markers on chromosome 7 (5 H) was effective in increasing -amylase activity.

40|$|Abstract Background Advanced cycle {{breeding}} utilizes crosses among elite {{lines and}} is a successful method to develop new inbreds. However, it results in a reduction in genetic diversity within the breeding population. The development of malting barley varieties requires the adherence to a narrow <b>malting</b> <b>quality</b> profile and thus the use of advanced cycle breeding strategies. Although attention {{has been focused on}} diversity in gene expression and its association with genetic diversity, there are no studies performed in a single breeding program examining the implications that consecutive cycles of breeding have on gene expression variation and identifying the variability still available for future improvement. Results Fifteen lines representing the historically important six-rowed malting barley breeding program of the University of Minnesota were genotyped with 1, 524 SNPs, phenotypically examined for six <b>malting</b> <b>quality</b> traits, and analyzed for transcript accumulation during germination using the Barley 1 GeneChip array. Significant correlation was detected between genetic and transcript-level variation. We observed a reduction in both genetic and gene expression diversity through the breeding process, although the expression of many genes have not been fixed. A high number of quality-related genes whose expression was fixed during the breeding process was identified, indicating that much of the diversity reduction was associated with the improvement of the complex phenotype "malting quality", the main goal of the University of Minnesota breeding program. We also identified 49 differentially expressed genes between the most recent lines of the program that were correlated with {{one or more of the}} six primary <b>malting</b> <b>quality</b> traits. These genes constitute potential targets for the improvement of <b>malting</b> <b>quality</b> within the breeding program. Conclusions The present study shows the repercussion of advanced cycle breeding on gene expression diversity within an important barley breeding program. A reduction in gene expression diversity was detected, although there is diversity still present after forty years of breeding that can exploited for future crop improvement. In addition, the identification of candidate genes for enhancing <b>malting</b> <b>quality</b> may be used to optimize the selection of targets for further improvements in this economically important phenotype. </p...|$|R

These hordein band patterns can be used in to account as an indicator of high or low <b>malt</b> <b>quality</b> criteria...|$|E
40|$|An {{intermediate}} stage breeding trial within the Northern Barley Improvement Program was assessed for feed grain and <b>malt</b> <b>quality.</b> Results {{indicated that there}} was a genetic effect for both malt and, importantly, ‘feed traits (as measured by hardness, acid detergent fibre, starch and in sacco dry matter). Overall, there was a ‘common’ set of quality traits which included large grain size, high levels of starch, lower fibre (husk) and high levels of digestible (fermentable) carbohydrates. The preliminary results from this study suggest that from measurements of relevant grain and <b>malt</b> <b>quality</b> parameters, {{it will be possible to}} select for both malt and feed quality traits within a breeding program...|$|E
40|$|Background - Optimization of <b>malt</b> <b>quality</b> {{with regard}} to a better {{lautering}} performance is {{a critical factor in}} the malting and brewing industry. Since <b>malt</b> <b>quality</b> is inversely related to the concentration of endosperm cell wall components such as arabinoxylans, management of cell wall degrading microorganisms may result in enhanced processing. An essential step in microflora management during malting requires the understanding of the microbial community structure as well as the population dynamics in the processing. Objectives – The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the microbial (bacterial) communities in different industrial malting settings and relate these to <b>malt</b> <b>quality</b> and processability. Methods and Conclusions - Both culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular techniques were used to characterize the bacterial communities in different industrial malting settings, generating malt of different quality. 16 S ribosomal DNA-targeted Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, supported by sequencing of clone libraries, were used to screen and compare the microbial communities at different stages of the malting process, i. e. from barley up to kilned malt. In addition, emphasis is put on the xylanase producing microflora. Apart from isolation and identification, the diversity of the xylanase genes was explored by amplifying xylanase genes from the glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 10 and 11. Specific patterns associated with high-quality malt will be further investigated, aiming at obtaining cultures important for the <b>malt</b> <b>quality.</b> Ultimately, this study may result in the discovery of promising, process-borne microorganisms which may enhance malt processability, or the malting and brewing process in general. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Characterization of the {{determinants}} of economically important phenotypes showing complex inheritance should lead to more effective use of genetic resources. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the number, genome location and effects of QTLs determining <b>malting</b> <b>quality</b> and agronomic traits in the two North American barley quality standards. Using a doubled haploid population of 140 lines from the cross of Harrington x Morex, agronomic phenotype and <b>malting</b> <b>quality</b> data sets from nine and eight environments, respectively, and a 107 -marker linkage map, QTL analyses were performed using simple interval mapping and simplified composite interval mapping procedures. Thirty five QTLs were associated either across environments or in individual environments, with five grain and agronomic traits (yield, kernel plumpness, test weight, heading date and plant height). Thirteen QTLs were associated with five <b>malting</b> <b>quality</b> traits (grain protein percentage, soluble/total protein ratio, α-amylase activity, diastatic power and malt extract percentage). QTLs for multiple traits were coincident. The loci controlling inflorescence type [vrsl on chromosome 2 (2 H) and int-c on chromosome 4 (4 H) ] were coincident with QTLs affecting all traits except heading date and malt extract percentage. The largest effect QTLs -for yield, kernel plumpness test weight, plant height grain protein percentage, S/T ratio, and diastatic power- were coincident with the vrsl locus. QTL analyses were conducted separately for each sub-population (six-rowed and two-rowed). Ten new QTLs were detected in the sub-populations. There were significant interactions between the vrsl and int-c loci for plant height, grain protein percentage, and SIT protein ratio. Positive transgressive segregants were found for all agronomic traits. They were more prevalent in the six-rowed sub-population, indicating that more favorable alleles were fixed in the two-rowed parent. Results suggest that this mating of two parents representing different germplasm groups caused a disruption in the balance of traits involved in <b>malting</b> <b>quality,</b> which resulted in no progeny carrying all favorable alleles and therefore surpassing the quality of either parent. This study describes some of the genetic {{determinants of}} agronomic and <b>malting</b> <b>quality</b> traits in a two-rowed x six-rowed cross and it is a first step toward the further characterization and manipulation of these determinants...|$|R
