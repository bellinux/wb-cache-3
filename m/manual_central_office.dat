50|$|A {{telephone}} exchange name or <b>central</b> <b>office</b> name was a distinguishing and memorable name {{assigned to a}} <b>central</b> <b>office.</b> It identified the switching system to which a telephone was connected. Each <b>central</b> <b>office</b> served a maximum of 10,000 subscriber lines identified by the last four digits of the telephone number. Areas or cities with more subscribers were served by multiple <b>central</b> <b>offices,</b> possibly hosted in the same building. The leading letters of a <b>central</b> <b>office</b> name were used as the leading components of the telephone number representation, so that each telephone number in an area was unique. These letters were mapped to digits, which was indicated visibly on a dial telephone.|$|R

40|$|Instructional {{leadership}} for school leaders is a complex, multifaceted task. <b>Central</b> <b>office</b> leaders {{can and must}} support the instructional leadership of school leaders. Yet the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> can sometimes present roadblocks that make it challenging for principals to be effective instructional leaders. Complicating matters {{is the impact of}} context, which can influence the ways that the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> supports or hinders the instructional leadership of school administrators. ^ This exploratory study examined the ways that the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> supported or hindered the instructional leadership of school administrators. It also examined the way that school district size, type and access to resources may have impacted those interactions. Participants included <b>central</b> <b>office</b> staff involved in teaching and learning as well as school principals and assistant principals in six public school districts in Pennsylvania. A qualitative design was employed. Fifty-one participants were interviewed and asked to provide documents related to curriculum, instruction, professional development, and/or assessment. ^ <b>Central</b> <b>office</b> administrators played a role in managing curriculum, assessment, professional development, and expectations in school districts. Supportive practices included fostering connections between and among school administrators, skill-building/mentoring, and shielding school administrators from community issues and state mandates. Practices that created roadblocks included lack of expertise and quality work products, failure to bring school administrators together around collaborative work, lack of trusting relationships, and failure to shield school administrators from community issues and state mandates. Tension around the balance between school autonomy and coherence to district mandates/needs, the process of change, feedback and accountability, and philosophical differences created additional roadblocks. Context was a relevant factor in the areas of trust and relationships, the amount of autonomy granted to school administrators, and the role of resources. ^ Four main conclusions were drawn. In the districts studied, there was little work on the part of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> around instructional strategies. The <b>central</b> <b>office</b> played a more direct role as instructional leaders in schools housed in smaller districts. When the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> engaged in supportive practices, fewer tensions were reported by participants within districts. Finally, the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> provided the “glue” that held schools together within a district. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), College of Education, Washington State UniversitySchool {{district}} <b>central</b> <b>offices</b> {{have increasingly}} {{been identified as}} important actors {{in the implementation of}} new education policy initiatives. This qualitative case study focuses on {{the ways in which the}} <b>central</b> <b>office</b> in a mid-sized school district supported school principals in implementing newly adopted teacher and principal evaluation criteria. The study examined how the school district's <b>central</b> <b>office</b> supported principals in their planning, preparation, and implementation of the new teacher and principal evaluation system (TPEP) in Washington State. Two research questions guided the completion of this research study: (a) What types of activities took place between the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> and the principals; and (b) Did the principals perceive these activities as helpful to their pursuit of effective implementation of the TPEP initiative in their school buildings? The findings highlight the importance of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators as boundary spanners in supporting the principals' development as leaders who have the capacity to enact the new evaluation criteria. Two themes emerged from interviews, observations and the review of documents. First, the use of existing district structures and relationships to support implementation at the school level was vital to the successful adoption of the evaluation criteria. This included working together as partners during the implementation and using common language from previous work within the district to achieve broadly shared understanding of the evaluation requirements. The second theme highlighted the importance of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators providing everyday support to school principals. Everyday support included providing meaningful professional development; engaging in regular meetings; working and learning with the school administrators; and engaging in constant, consistent communication about the implementation of the policy. Collectively, the findings highlight how important it is that <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators consistently review their leadership practices with principals to ensure that they are providing meaningful structures and support. Further research on the ways in which <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators support principals is needed. In particular, research that focuses on how <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators measure their own practices relative to principal needs is urgently needed. Such consideration is particularly important as new policy initiatives demand that <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators create and establish effective support for school principals.

This study describes {{the work of}} <b>central</b> <b>office</b> teacher leaders, and identifies ways they carry out their work {{in different parts of}} their school district. The author uses a qualitative interview approach to explore how <b>central</b> <b>office</b> teacher leaders enact their work as they move between the school district <b>central</b> <b>office</b> and schools. Data for the study were gathered through in-depth qualitative interviews with twelve <b>central</b> <b>office</b> teacher leaders from five Midwestern school districts. Participants perceived themselves as sensemakers who help others understand new ideas in teaching and learning, and {{what is going on in}} various parts of the school district structure. Participants engaged in a wide variety of work throughout their school districts. In their view, four core professional practices mediate the effect of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> teacher leadership, including the continuous deepening of professional expertise, gathering and sharing information, making sense of teaching and learning, and making sense of the organization. In addition, <b>central</b> <b>office</b> teacher leaders rely on critical organizational supports to increase district capacities for teaching and learning, including systemic commitment, a well-articulated plan for professional learning, time and ongoing interactions with teachers and principals, and a dual presence in schools and in the <b>central</b> <b>office.</b> The study makes three unique contributions.
