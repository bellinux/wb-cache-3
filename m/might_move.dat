With speculation that Tomkins <b>might</b> <b>move</b> to the National Rugby League or switch codes to rugby union, Wigan offered him a new five-year contract keeping him at the club {{until the end of}} the 2015 season.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, Shaughnessy {{traveled}} to Yale University, which was considering three candidates for its vacant head coaching position. A month later, {{he said he}} was not interested in Yale, but that he <b>might</b> <b>move</b> to an unnamed Eastern school with little football tradition. Shaughnessy resigned in March 1942 to move to Maryland. A 1977 Sports Illustrated article reported that he decided to leave when he realized Stanford might discontinue its football program during World War II. He expressed disappointment about leaving, but believed the new job would provide a challenge. Maryland reportedly offered the same salary as Stanford, $9,000 ($ adjusted for inflation), and a position on its faculty.|$|E
5|$|Whereas many {{pitchers}} throw with a three-quarter or sidearm motion, Koufax threw with {{a pronounced}} over-the-top arm action. This may have increased his velocity, but reduced the lateral movement on his pitches, especially {{movement away from}} left-handed hitters. Most of his velocity came from his strong legs and back, combined with a high kicking wind-up and long forward stretch toward the plate. Throughout his career, Koufax relied mostly on two pitches. His four-seam fastball gave batters the impression of rising as it approached them, due to underspin. It not only appeared to move very late but also <b>might</b> <b>move</b> two or three distinct times. His overhand curveball, spun with the middle finger, dropped vertically 12 to 24inches due to his arm action. Rob Neyer called it the best curve of all time. He also occasionally threw a changeup and a forkball.|$|E

5|$|In September 2001, Studio Ghibli {{announced}} {{the production of}} two films. The first would become The Cat Returns and the second was an adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones' novel, Howl's Moving Castle. A rumor persists that Miyazaki had an idea to do Howl's Moving Castle {{during a visit to}} Strasbourg Christmas market. Toshio Suzuki, who produced Howl's Moving Castle, stated that Miyazaki was inspired to make the film when he read Jones' novel, and was struck by the image of a castle moving around the countryside. The novel does not explain how the castle moved, and Miyazaki was interested in figuring out how the castle <b>might</b> <b>move,</b> which led to the image of a castle on chicken legs. The complex moving castle changes and rearranges itself several times throughout the movie in response to Howl's eccentricity and the various situations. The basic structure of the castle consists of more than 80 elements including turrets, a wagging tongue, cogwheels and chicken legs, that were rendered as digital objects.|$|E
5|$|In the 1910–11 Australian season, Crawford {{scored a}} half-century in every {{first-class}} game he played but was less successful with the ball. His success against the touring South Africans, perhaps helped by his experience facing their googly bowlers on previous occasions, brought him close to selection for the Australian Test team that year. The Australian Board of Control eventually decided that, {{as he had}} already appeared for England, they could not choose him; instead they picked Charlie Kelleway as the all-rounder. Crawford resigned from his position as St Peter's in March 1911, suggesting to the press that he <b>might</b> <b>move</b> into farming. He may have considered leaving South Australia, but the Cricket Association appointed him as a clerk at the Adelaide Oval, a position which earned £200 per annum, with additional responsibility for coaching and youth scouting. Meanwhile, in England, after unsuccessful attempts by his father to change {{the mind of the}} Surrey committee, including a failed bid to secure his own election to the committee, Crawford sent a written apology to Surrey at some time in 1910. Consequently, the committee passed a motion in March 1911 which ended the ban on Crawford playing for the county.|$|E

25|$|The 2013–14 season saw Heatley's {{production}} decline dramatically, as {{he recorded}} only nine goals and 19 points {{in his first}} 55 games.

Grant directed that Meade tell Sheridan about the dispositions and that Sheridan should take direction of the forces being sent to him. Meade did not tell Grant that the plan to move Warren's entire corps to Sheridan's aid was Warren's idea.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Soros was a {{minority}} {{partner in a}} group that tried to buy the Washington Nationals, a Major League baseball team. Some Republican lawmakers suggested that they <b>might</b> <b>move</b> to revoke Major League Baseball's antitrust exemption if Soros bought the team. In 2008, Soros's name was associated with AS Roma, an Italian association football team, but the club was not sold. Soros was a financial backer of Washington Soccer L.P., the group that owned the operating rights to Major League Soccer club D.C. United when the league was founded in 1995, but the group lost these rights in 2000. On August 21, 2012, BBC reported SEC filings showing Soros acquired roughly a 1.9 percent stake in English football club Manchester United through the purchase of 3.1million of the club's Class-A shares.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge of {{innovation}} was spread by several means. Workers who {{were trained in}} the technique <b>might</b> <b>move</b> to another employer or might be poached. A common method was for someone to make a study tour, gathering information where he could. During {{the whole of the}} Industrial Revolution and for the century before, all European countries and America engaged in study-touring; some nations, like Sweden and France, even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy. In other countries, notably Britain and America, this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers eager to improve their own methods. Study tours were common then, as now, as was the keeping of travel diaries. Records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods.|$|E

While indigenous people are relatively poor, little evidence {{was found that}} the informal economy is a higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people. While the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in 2000, by 2006 this process had been reversed with growing informality. While rural municipios have smaller economies, they are not different than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal. Programs in the past that <b>might</b> <b>move</b> economic activity from the informal to the formal sector have not succeeded, suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will continue to plague the state with low government revenues.|$|E
25|$|Eden {{believed}} that if Nasser were seen {{to get away with}} seizing the Canal then Egypt and other Arab countries <b>might</b> <b>move</b> closer to the Soviet Union. At that time, the Middle East accounted for 80–90 percent of Western Europe's oil supply. If Nasser were seen to get away with it, then other Middle East countries might be encouraged to nationalise their oil. The invasion, he contended at the time, and again in a 1967 interview, was aimed at maintaining the sanctity of international agreements and at preventing future unilateral denunciation of treaties. Eden was energetic during the crisis in using the media, including the BBC, to incite public opinion to support his views of the need to overthrow Nasser. In September 1956 a plan was drawn up to reduce the flow of water in the Nile by using dams in an attempt to damage Nasser's position. However, the plan was abandoned because it would take months to implement, and due to fears that it could affect other countries such as Uganda and Kenya.|$|E
