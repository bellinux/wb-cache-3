25|$|A {{cash flow}} ARM is a <b>minimum</b> <b>payment</b> option {{mortgage}} loan. This {{type of loan}} allows a borrower to choose their monthly payment from several options. These payment options usually include the option to pay at the 30-year level, 15-year level, interest only level, and a <b>minimum</b> <b>payment</b> level. The <b>minimum</b> <b>payment</b> level is usually lower than the interest only payment. This type of loan can result in negative amortization. The option to make a <b>minimum</b> <b>payment</b> is usually available only for the first several years of the loan.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} bancarization of {{marginal}} borrowers using {{credit cards and}} document that this process is difficult: default risk is substantial, returns heterogeneous, and account closings common. We also {{take advantage of a}} randomized control trial that varied interest rates and <b>minimum</b> <b>payments</b> in a very wide range. Against our hypothesis, we find that default risk is very insensitive to (randomized) large changes in interest rates and <b>minimum</b> <b>payments.</b> This could imply that regulating these contract terms may not necessarily "protect" consumers against default and that moral hazard in this market is negligible on average...|$|R
25|$|In 1958, Bank of America had {{introduced}} BankAmeriCard (today's Visa), the first credit card on a revolving credit model, in which cardholders {{did not have}} to pay the full balance each month but merely a <b>minimum</b> <b>payment</b> if they so chose. It, like other banks in those days, tried to promote use of them by mailing cards, unsolicited, to multiple, sometimes randomly chosen, customers in a particular area.|$|E
25|$|Despite such patently obvious {{misstatements}} {{of membership}} size, the WAA did immediately begin constructive work with top {{officials of the}} American Federation of Labor (AF of L) with respect to standards and practices relating to Depression-related unemployment relief. In April 1935 WAA Chairman Lasser announced that agreement had been reached with AF of L President William Green relating to the organization of workers employed through the government's $4.8 billion work relief program {{with a view to}} the unionization of those so employed. The joint program of the WAA and AF of L was said to include payment of union scale for all skilled workers, a <b>minimum</b> <b>payment</b> of $30 per week for all workers on relief, and provision for collective bargaining for all workers on work-relief projects.|$|E
25|$|Each month, the {{cardholder}} is sent {{a statement}} indicating the purchases {{made with the}} card, any outstanding fees, and the total amount owed. In the US, after receiving the statement, the cardholder may dispute any charges {{that he or she}} thinks are incorrect (see , which limits cardholder liability for unauthorized use of a credit card to $50). The Fair Credit Billing Act gives details of the US regulations. The cardholder must pay a defined minimum portion of the amount owed by a due date, or may choose to pay a higher amount. The credit issuer charges interest on the unpaid balance if the billed amount is not paid in full (typically at a much higher rate than most other forms of debt). In addition, if the cardholder fails to make at least the <b>minimum</b> <b>payment</b> by the due date, the issuer may impose a late fee or other penalties. To help mitigate this, some financial institutions can arrange for automatic payments to be deducted from the cardholder's bank account, thus avoiding such penalties altogether, as long as the cardholder has sufficient funds.|$|E
5000|$|The {{present value}} of the <b>minimum</b> lease <b>payments</b> (MLP) is {{equal to or greater}} than 90% of the fair market value of leased property. To {{understand}} and apply this criterion, you need familiarize yourself with what is included in the <b>minimum</b> lease <b>payments</b> and how the present value is calculated. The <b>minimum</b> lease <b>payments</b> include the <b>minimum</b> rental <b>payments</b> minus any executory cost, the guaranteed residual value, the bargain purchase option, and any penalty for failure to renew or extend the lease. The amount calculated is then discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. However, if the lessee knows the implicit rate used by the lessor and the rate is less than the lessee’s rate, the lessee should use the lessor’s rate to discount the <b>minimum</b> lease <b>payment.</b>|$|R

25|$|A channel {{agreement}} for Virgin Media to keep non-premium Sky channels ended on 1 March 2007. Virgin Media and Sky {{failed to reach}} agreement on the issue, and Sky reacted by posting {{a letter to the}} public in major UK newspapers on 28 February 2007. Despite Sky's letter, Virgin Media blamed Sky for tyrannising them and inciting consumers to switch. The companies failed to resolve their differences, and subsequently after midnight on 1 March 2007, Virgin Media replaced the Sky 1, Sky 2, Sky Travel, Sky Travel Extra, Sky Sports News and Sky News channel content with a standard message. Sky attributed part of the rate rise {{to the fact that the}} new deal would also include Sky 3, Sky Arts and undisclosed high definition and video on demand content. Sky said the deal would cost only 3p per customer per day (roughly £35,000,000 per year), but Virgin said that a <b>minimum</b> <b>payment</b> guarantee included in the contract meant that the actual amount due would exceed twice the current payment.|$|E

500|$|In July 1919 Bottomley {{announced}} his [...] "Victory Bonds Club", {{based on the}} government's latest issue of Victory Bonds. Normally, these bonds cost £5; in Bottomley's club, subscribers bought units for a <b>minimum</b> <b>payment</b> of £1, and participated in an annual draw for prizes—up to £20,000, he said—funded from accrued interest. Contrary to Bottomley's public statements, not all the money subscribed was used to buy bonds. He had ambitions to become a press baron, to rival such as the Lords Rothermere and Beaverbrook. In October 1919 he used War Bonds funds to buy two obscure newspapers, the National News and the Sunday Evening Telegram. The papers were not financially successful, and in 1921 Bottomley closed the Telegram and changed {{the name of the}} National News to Sunday Illustrated. To bolster its fortunes, he transferred his Sunday Pictorial column to the Illustrated, and mounted an expensive promotional campaign, but with little benefit. The paper languished, while Bottomley lost the large income and readership that went with the Pictorial. His fortunes declined further when, in 1920, Odhams revoked the pre-war partnership agreement and took full control of John Bull. Bottomley was made editor for life, but a year later Odhams terminated this arrangement with a final pay-off of £25,000, which ended Bottomley's connection with the paper.|$|E

2500|$|An [...] "option ARM" [...] is {{typically}} a 30-year ARM that initially offers the borrower four monthly payment options: a specified <b>minimum</b> <b>payment,</b> an interest-only payment, a 15-year fully amortizing payment, and a 30-year fully amortizing payment.|$|E
2500|$|When a {{borrower}} makes a Pay-Option ARM payment that is {{less than}} the accruing interest, there is [...] "negative amortization", which means that the unpaid portion of the accruing interest is added to the outstanding principal balance. For example, if the borrower makes a <b>minimum</b> <b>payment</b> of $1,000 and the ARM has accrued monthly interest of $1,500, $500 will be added to the borrower's loan balance. Moreover, the next month's interest-only payment will be calculated using the new, higher principal balance.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>minimum</b> <b>payment</b> on an Option ARM {{can jump}} {{dramatically}} if its unpaid principal balance hits the maximum limit on negative amortization (typically 110% to 125% {{of the original}} loan amount). If that happens, the next minimum monthly payment will be {{at a level that}} would fully amortize the ARM over its remaining term. [...] In addition, Option ARMs typically have automatic [...] "recast" [...] dates (often every fifth year) when the payment is adjusted to get the ARM back on pace to amortize the ARM in full over its remaining term.|$|E

2500|$|See the {{complete}} {{article for the}} type of ARM that Negative amortization loans are by nature. [...] Higher risk products, such as First Lien Monthly Adjustable loans with Negative amortization and Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have different ways of structuring the Cap than a typical First Lien Mortgage. The typical First Lien Monthly Adjustable loans with Negative amortization loan has a life cap for the underlying rate (aka [...] "Fully Indexed Rate") between 9.95% and 12% (maximum assessed interest rate). Some of these loans can have much higher rate ceilings. The fully indexed rate is always listed on the statement, but borrowers are shielded from the full effect of rate increases by the <b>minimum</b> <b>payment,</b> until the loan is recast, which is when principal and interest payments are due that will fully amortize the loan at the fully indexed rate.|$|E
