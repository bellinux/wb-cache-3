25|$|Where {{junction}} <b>indicators</b> are unsuitable, <b>route</b> <b>indicators</b> {{are also}} used in colour-light areas.

At certain locations, no route indication is given for the highest-speed route. As with semaphore <b>route</b> <b>indicators,</b> they are usually restricted to areas where all routes are at low speed, often on the approach or departure from large stations.|$|R

25|$|In {{areas where}} speeds are lower {{and there are}} a number of routes which can be taken, {{alphanumeric}} (also called theatre-style) <b>route</b> <b>indicators</b> are used to display a number or a letter (e.g. a platform number or line designation) to denote the route the train is to take. They may be located above or beside the relevant signal. When a route is set and the signal is cleared, the relevant letter or number is shown. On shunting signals, where speeds are much lower, a miniature version of the alphanumeric <b>route</b> <b>indicator</b> is used.|$|R

50|$|In principle, an {{independent}} home or starting signal must be installed for each route. If this proves difficult, one signal {{can be used}} for multiple routes. In this case, a <b>route</b> <b>indicator</b> (進路表示機, shinro hyōjiki) displays the route a train is permitted to follow.|$|R

2500|$|Where {{there is}} a large number of {{possible}} routes, splitting signals are unsuitable because they would be easily confused, and <b>route</b> <b>indicators</b> are used instead. These consist of a black background, mounted under a single stop signal, on which is superimposed a white letter(s), number(s) or combination of the two, to make a code indicating the route to be taken. For example, if the possible routes were to Cambridge and to Norwich, a Norwich-bound train might be shown 'N' and a Cambridge-bound train 'C'. The route code is only shown when the signal is off. In semaphore areas, <b>route</b> <b>indicators</b> may be <b>mechanical,</b> with boards that slide into view to display the code; or electric [...] "theatre-type", with a light projected through a suitably-printed screen.|$|R
50|$|At {{high speed}} junctions, turnout {{indications}} {{are no longer}} provided. Instead, the signal in rear of the junction signal is provided with a directional indicator.

40|$|Abstract. According to the {{characteristics}} of a curve on the surface, the correlation between the placement feasibility for fiber tow and the surface shape of a composite component, width of the fiber tows is analyzed. The placement process route under the condition of fiber tow ultimate deformation is calculated. In addition, based on fiber loading orientation in the designed placement layers, the best <b>mechanical</b> <b>route</b> is calculated. Through the given proportionality coefficient of geodesic arc radii under the constrain conditions of the mechanics and fiber tow deformability on the present route point, a simple modeling approach is proposed to obtain the actual model of the route with the goal of satisfying the best <b>mechanical</b> <b>route</b> orientation. Take the placement of a free form surface as an example to verify the approach, with the result of indicating its reasonableness...|$|R

50|$|A {{total of}} {{seventeen}} Class 142 units based at Newton Heath depot (142041-9 and 142051-8) were refurbished {{for use on}} Merseyside PTE's City Line on services around the Liverpool and Greater Manchester areas. The refurbishment included dot-matrix <b>route</b> <b>indicators,</b> a new design of individual low-backed seating and the units were repainted into Merseyrail's livery. Upon privatisation these units passed to First North Western in March 1997. All of these sets are now with Northern and however remain in the livery of previous operator Northern Rail.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{recycling}} of {{nickel metal hydride}} (NiMH), lithium ion (Li-ion) and primary lithium batteries was examined. Three <b>mechanical</b> <b>routes</b> of treatment were developed for each type recovering mainly three fractions: ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals and electrodic powders. The above mentioned types of spent batteries were also treated together by a unique <b>mechanical</b> <b>route,</b> obtaining in this way a powder enriched in cobalt, nickel and manganese which can be further extractable by chemical leaching. Experimental tests of solvent extraction were performed on synthetic leach liquors simulating a feed mixture of spent devices with weight composition 40 % NiMH, 40 % primary lithium, and 20 % Li-ion (as determined by manual sorting of 3 tons of end of life batteries collected in Northern Italy). Under these conditions nickel and cobalt can be easily separated by using Cyanex 272 (stoichiometric ratio Cyanex/Co = 4, pH 5 - 6), but in presence of manganese Cyanex 272 loses its selectivity towards cobalt. Thus manganese must be preliminarily removed by using D 2 EHPA (stoichiometric ratio D 2 EHPA/Mn = 2, pH 4). Mechanical treatments and hydrometallurgical section to recover metals from electrodic powder are unavoidable operations in order to recover at least 50 % of batteries as weight according to European Guideline 2006 / 66 /EC.

Speed coordination evaluation criteria: |ΔV 85 |≤ 10 [*]km/h, good coordination; 10 [*]km/h ≤|ΔV 85 |≤[*] 20 [*]km/h, general coordination, <b>route</b> <b>indicators</b> of adjacent sections should be adjusted, so that the speed difference is not more than 10 [*]km/h; |ΔV 85 |≥ 20 [*]km/h, poor speed coordination, it needs to readjust the design of the adjacent sections. Speed gradient evaluation criteria: Gv≤ 0. 10, good road safety; 0. 10 ≤Gv 0. 15, poor road safety and the adjacent sections need to readjust. The conclusions provide the theoretical reference for highway safety evaluation...|$|R

50|$|In June 2016, cars 7501-7510 and 7928 {{had their}} route signs {{modified}} with green circle/red diamond LED signs and a LED number display, {{similar to those}} on the R62As originally used on the 7 (and currently on the 6). This modification was done presumably {{due to the fact}} that passengers on the 7 cannot visually differentiate between an express train and local train, despite the announcements and digital signage. In the following year, 7501 had the LCD destination indicator parts of its destination signs replaced with LED panels to make them aesthetically similar to the <b>route</b> <b>indicator.</b> It is currently unknown if the remainder of the R188 fleet will be retrofitted with these features.|$|R

50|$|Under route signalling, {{a driver}} is {{informed}} which route the train will take beyond each signal (unless only one route is possible). This {{is achieved by}} a <b>route</b> <b>indicator</b> attached to the signal. The driver uses his route knowledge, reinforced by speed restriction signs fixed at the lineside, to drive the train at the correct speed for the route to be taken. This method has the disadvantage that the driver may be unfamiliar with a route onto {{which he has been}} diverted due to some emergency condition. Several accidents have been caused by this alone. For this reason, in the UK drivers are only allowed to drive on routes that they have been trained on and must regularly travel over the lesser used diversionary routes to keep their route knowledge up to date.|$|R
40|$|A mean-field {{lattice model}} {{is applied to}} chain {{molecules}} {{for the study of}} surfactant systems. As an example, C 12 E 5 surfactants, modeled as C 12 O(C 2 O) 5 chains, are forced into cylindrical and spherical shaped vesicles in a monomer solvent. These aggregates are used to obtain the rigidity constants of the bilayers {{as a function of the}} hydrophilicity of the surfactant’s headgroup from both a thermodynamic and a <b>mechanical</b> <b>route.</b> Within the numerical accuracy, both routes are fully consistent. The magnitude and sign of the rigidity constants are interpreted to gain insight into features of the experimentally well-established phase diagram.
