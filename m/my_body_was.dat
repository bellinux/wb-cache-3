500|$|Rapace {{described}} Shaw, an archaeologist, as {{a believer}} in God with a very strong faith, and said that, [...] "In {{the middle of the}} movie, things happen and she changes into more of a warrior. And in the end, she's such a survivor." [...] To aid her method acting, she developed a complete backstory for Shaw, and worked with a dialect coach to achieve a British accent. She also asked her make-up artist to apply extra blood and sweat during filming to more accurately portray her character. Rapace said, [...] "I was out there filming for about six months and it was super-intense, <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> in so much pain sometimes but it was absolutely amazing." [...] She dismissed comparisons to the Alien franchise's Ellen Ripley. Rapace came to director Ridley Scott's attention for her performance as Lisbeth Salander in the 2009 drama film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. She met Scott in August 2010, and by January 2011 she had secured the role. Actresses Anne Hathaway, Natalie Portman, Gemma Arterton, Carey Mulligan, and Abbie Cornish were all considered for the role during development. Lucy Hutchinson, who was eight years old in 2012, portrays Shaw as a child.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{began her}} {{professional}} {{career as a}} dancer in a 1994 dinner theater production of A Chorus Line in Boulder, Colorado. The gig required her to wait on tables before getting up on stage to perform. Although she enjoyed singing and dancing, she disliked waitressing and ran into trouble when a fellow dancer, whom she considered a friend, made false accusations about her to the director. Adams said, [...] "I never really knew what the lies were. I only knew I kept getting called in and lectured about my lack of professionalism." [...] She lost the job but went on to perform in dinner theater at Denver's Heritage Square Music Hall and Country Dinner Playhouse. During a performance of Anything Goes at the Country Dinner Playhouse in 1995, she was spotted by Michael Brindisi, the president and {{artistic director of the}} Minneapolis-based Chanhassen Dinner Theater, who offered her a job there. Adams relocated to Chanhassen, Minnesota, where she performed in the theater for the next three years. She loved the [...] "security and schedule" [...] of the job, and has said that she learned tremendously from it. Nonetheless, the grueling work took its toll on her: [...] "I had a lot of recurring injuriesbursitis in my knees, pulled muscles in my groin, my adductor and abductor. <b>My</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> wearing out." ...|$|E

I couldn't stop thinking. <b>My</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> exhausted, and my mind was still going."

On 7 March he read to the Society his longest paper yet, which explained the earthquake he had witnessed at Concepción, Chile, in terms of gradual crustal movements, {{to the delight of}} Lyell. Despite hours of practice, as he later recalled; [...] "I was so nervous at first, I somehow could see nothing all around me, & felt as if <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> gone, & only my head left".|$|E

2500|$|Schwarzenegger {{wanted to}} move from {{bodybuilding}} into acting, finally achieving {{it when he was}} chosen {{to play the role of}} Hercules in 1970's Hercules in New York. Credited under the stage name [...] "Arnold Strong", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he was awarded a Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: [...] "It was very difficult for me in the beginning– I was told by agents and casting people that <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV News in November 2009, Clarkson stated that while performing on the All I Ever Wanted Tour, she would also be {{in the process of}} writing new material for her fifth studio album, which she hoped for a late 2010 release. Later, during the Chart Show TV, Clarkson revealed that she wanted to do something different for the album. Her label felt the same way. On March 4, 2010, Clarkson was announced to perform on the revived Lilith Fair music festival. However, low ticket sales and scheduling conflicts led Clarkson and Norah Jones to cancel their upcoming performances. Clarkson remarked she would focus on recording for her upcoming album instead. Clarkson took a six-month break from her music career in 2010. Clarkson, who had a hectic schedule following the release of her sophomore album Breakaway, admitted that her music career had a bad effect on her health, saying [...] "Because my career went from zero to 100, there was no 'growing'. I learnt well under pressure, but, like, four years passed by and I hit rock bottom, Breakaway just exploded everywhere. Everyone was making a lot of money, so everyone was pushing the train. That's when it finally all caught up with me. I came down with 'walking pneumonia' {{for the second time in}} a year. <b>My</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> physically giving up.
