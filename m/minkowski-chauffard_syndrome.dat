50|$|Hereditary spherocytosis (also {{known as}} <b>Minkowski-Chauffard</b> <b>syndrome)</b> is an {{autosomal}} dominant abnormality of erythrocytes. The disorder {{is caused by}} mutations in genes relating to membrane proteins that allow for the erythrocytes to change shape. The abnormal erythrocytes are sphere-shaped (spherocytosis) rather than the normal biconcave disk shaped. Dysfunctional membrane proteins interfere with the cell's ability to be flexible to travel from the arteries to the smaller capillaries. This difference in shape also makes the red blood cells more prone to rupture. Cells with these dysfunctional proteins are taken for degradation at the spleen. This shortage of erythrocytes results in hemolytic anemia.|$|E
