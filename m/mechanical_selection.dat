30|$|Abutment {{selection}} {{according to}} collar length index {{is a critical}} <b>mechanical</b> factor; <b>selection</b> of longer abutments leads to an increased vertical cantilever which acts as a force magnifier [8]. Vertical cantilever designs increase forces on screws due to the lever effect and, therefore, should be avoided [17, 18]. Although increased restorative vertical space with longer collar length could {{play a role in}} screw loosening, there is no certain evidence that increase in abutment collar length can affect screw loosening. However, considering the abutment height from implant platform to the top of abutment (including abutment collar), an increase in the collar length might result in an increase in the vertical cantilever. To reduce the possibility of screw loosening, reducing the cantilever length has been recommended [9].|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Amniotic fluids were collected between 15 - 22 [*]weeks of gestation and stem cells were isolated by CD 117 based and <b>mechanical</b> <b>selection</b> protocols. Stem cells were characterized by mesenchymal stem cell marker expression and differentiation protocols. Cells were manipulated with a lentiviral vector system expressing the β-galactosidase reporter gene and were injected into immunodeficient newborn mouse pups. Qualitative assessment was performed to detect the infused cells after 1 [*]week. RESULTS: 78 Clonal amniotic fluid stem cell populations were successfully isolated by <b>mechanical</b> <b>selection</b> from 21 consecutive amniocentesis samples. They were positive for mesenchymal stem cell CD markers and could be differentiated into the different lineages. Stem cells were stably labeled using β-galactosidase and were detected in the lungs and hearts of the neonatal mice.

40|$|Reducing and {{managing}} {{the environmental impacts}} of building structures has become a priority of building stakeholders and within the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) community; although, conflicting approaches and methods to combat the issues are present. For example, green building standards are widespread throughout the world; however each one has its own characteristics and consequently its own specific requirements. While all have proven to be effective rating systems and have similar requirements, the distinguishing characteristic that separates them is their treatment of performance and prescriptive metrics. The feature they all severely lack or currently limit is the inclusion of strict engineering evaluation through energy simulations; hence, the reason why they fail to offer procedural steps to meet performance metrics. How can design professionals design energy efficient buildings with such constraints? Fortunately, advances in technology have allowed design professionals access to content found in Building Information Modeling (BIM). However, extracting pertinent information for specific use in energy analysis is problematic because BIM software currently available is filled with interoperability issues when placed in external software for energy analysis and energy analysis software itself is created with many assumptions that affect the tabulated energy results.
