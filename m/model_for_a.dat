5|$|One {{of these}} aspects which fascinated Balzac was {{the life of}} crime. In the winter of 1828–29, a French grifter-turned-policeman named Eugène François Vidocq {{published}} a pair of sensationalized memoirs recounting his criminal exploits. Balzac met Vidocq in April 1834, and used him as a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> character named Vautrin he was planning for an upcoming novel.|$|E
5|$|Here {{we can see}} how {{important}} the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry {{as a model for}} the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Olivia {{introduced}} Pound to vorticist sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska at an art {{exhibition at}} the Albert Hall. At the same exhibition the sculptor met Nina Hamnett, whom he subsequently used as a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> series of nudes bronzes, one of which Olivia bought. In 1914, Olivia translated a grimoire for Yeats and Pound, who spent November 1913 to January 1914 in the countryside at Stone Cottage in Ashdown Forest—Pound acting as secretary to Yeats—researching the occult. They read several grimoires, and Olivia provided for them a translation of the Abbot of Villar's 1670 grimoire Le Comte de Gabalis. Her translation was serialised in the literary magazine The Egoist later that year.|$|E

The {{purpose of}} the study was: (1) to develop scattering <b>models</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> inhomogeneous medium; (2) to develop scattering <b>models</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> irregular surface; (3) to combine volume and surface scattering to obtain useful scattering and emission <b>models</b> <b>for</b> terrains; and (4) to apply the developed model to the interpretation of measured data and the design of future experiments...|$|R
5|$|On the {{top right}} corner of the <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> surface weather map is the {{pressure}}, showing the last two integer digits of the pressure in millibars, or hectopascals, along with the first decimal. For instance, if the pressure at a certain location is 999.7hPa, the pressure portion of the station model will read 997. Although the first digit or two of the pressure is left off, other nearby stations give away whether the pressure starts with a 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that would lead to a value nearest to 1000 works out best. The plotting of this value within the station model allows for the analysis of isobars on weather maps. Within maps which plot data on constant pressure surfaces, the pressure is replaced with the height of the pressure surface.|$|E
5|$|Paul Drude in 1900 {{proposed}} the first theoretical <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> classical electron moving through a metallic solid. Drude's model described properties of metals {{in terms of}} a gas of free electrons, and was the first microscopic model to explain empirical observations such as the Wiedemann–Franz law. However, despite the success of Drude's free electron model, it had one notable problem: it was unable to correctly explain the electronic contribution to the specific heat and magnetic properties of metals, and the temperature dependence of resistivity at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The De Beatis description, only rediscovered by Steppe in the 1960s, cast {{new light}} on the {{commissioning}} of a work that was previously thoughtsince it has no central religious imageto be an atypical altarpiece. Many Netherlandish diptychs intended for private use are known, and even a few triptychs, but the Bosch panels are unusually large compared with these and contain no donor portraits. Possibly they were commissioned to celebrate a wedding, as large Italian paintings for private houses frequently were. Nevertheless, The Gardens bold depictions do not rule out a church commission, such was the contemporaneous fervor to warn against immorality. In 1566, the triptych served as the <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> tapestry that hangs at El Escorial monastery near Madrid.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, McNair's {{idea for}} a Yellow Jacket was reintroduced by another Georgia Tech student, Richie Bland. Bland, who was {{apparently}} unaware of McNair's prior initiative, paid $1,400 to have a local theme park costume designer make a yellow jacket costume that he first wore at a pep rally prior to the Tennessee football game. Rather than obtain permission from Georgia Tech as Judi had done in 1972, this student, {{a few weeks later}} simply sneaked onto the field in costume during a football game and ran across the field. The fans naturally believed that this costumed character was acting as an official member of the cheerleading squad and responded accordingly. By 1980 this new incarnation of the yellow jacket mascot was given the name Buzz Bee and was adopted as an official mascot by Georgia Tech. This new Buzz character would be the <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new Georgia Tech emblem, designed in 1985 by Mike Lester.|$|E

Razer's success spawned {{a number of}} imitations: SuicidalTendencies, Ming3 and Tiberius are amongst the other heavyweight robots to have adopted such a weapon, whilst the featherweight robot Venom is a scaled-down replica of Razer. In 2001, Razer appeared in cartoon form on the front cover of the seventeenth issue of Robot Wars Magazine. It was {{also included in the}} Robot Wars video games. The version of Razer which competed in the fourth series of Robot Wars was used as the <b>model</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pull-back toy powered by friction motors. This was sold alongside a model stunt ramp and barrels. A small metal toy based on Razer was available as part of the Robot Wars minibots range and, alongside Chaos 2 and Hypno-Disc, Razer was one of three competitor robots chosen to appear on a personalised DVD as part of the Robot Wars Ultimate Warrior Collection series.|$|E
