'Homotonality' is by {{no means}} {{uncommon}} in compositions of the Baroque era: many Baroque multi-movement works based on dance-forms manifest the same tonic—and even the same mode (major or minor) -- throughout. Thus, for example, J.S. Bach's solo violin partita BWV 1004 is homotonal <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> D minor, as is his solo flute partita BWV 1013 <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> A minor. Similarly, Vivaldi's sonata for oboe and continuo RV53 (n.d.) is homotonal <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> C minor. Homotonality is even encountered in some Baroque concertos: examples include Vivaldi's Cello Concertos RV401 (n.d.) <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> C minor and RV416 (n.d.) <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> G minor, and Jean-Marie Leclair's Violin Concerto Op.7 No 1 (1737) <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> D minor.|$|R

In this paper we propose a tractable general equilibrium asset pricing model with heterogeneous firms that links <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> stock and bond markets to macroeconomic activity. The model suggests that <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> risk premia in corporate bond markets are an important determinant of aggregate fluctuations. We show that <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> credit spreads forecast recessions by predicting future <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> corporate investment. Endogenous <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> credit markets allow our model to quantitatively match the observed conditional and unconditional <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> stock market returns and credit spreads with a reasonable amount of aggregate volatility...|$|R

Third, the variance decomposition results show that the level factor accounts for a substantial part of the variance at the long end of the yield curve at all horizons. At short horizons, the slope factor accounts for much of the variance at the short end of the yield curve. Finally, we show that <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> the level of the yield curve are associated with <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> long-term inflation expectations, while <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> the slope of the curve are associated with <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> the short-term nominal interest rate.
