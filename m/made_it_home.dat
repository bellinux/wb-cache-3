However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed {{and it became}} covered in graffiti.

5|$|However, with Moltke crippled, Admiral Scheer {{decided to}} return to base. Though {{scouting}} units of the Grand Fleet made brief contact with the Germans on the morning of 25 April, no action followed, and the High Seas Fleet <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>home</b> without incident. At one point in the chase, however, a reversal of course by the Germans meant that the entire Grand Fleet was forced to reorient itself in the opposite direction, placing Battleship Division Nine in the van. The result was that, if an encounter between the two fleets had occurred, American battleships would have led the British fleet into what could have been the largest naval battle of the war.|$|E
25|$|Kent Spitfires {{had their}} run of three {{successive}} victories broken by Durham Dynamos, never recovering from their initial position at two runs for three wickets after ducks from James Tredwell, Joe Denly and Darren Stevens. Michael Carberry, {{who came in}} with the score 27 for 4, made 63 with ten fours, but no other batsman passed 30, and Neil Killeen and Gareth Breese shared the last five wickets as Kent posted 140. Gavin Hamilton, who made 43, and Jimmy Maher with 70 shared an opening stand of 123, and despite two wickets from Tredwell, Durham <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>home</b> in under {{two thirds of the}} allotted overs.|$|E

25|$|Two more ships {{entered the}} sound — San Juan de Ragusa (650 tons, 285 men), the other unidentified. San Juan de Ragusa was in {{distress}} and sank — perhaps on striking Dunbinna reef. San Juan de Bautista attempted {{to take advantage}} of an ebb tide and sail south out of the sound, but ended up tacking about on the flood tide to avoid the numerous reefs, before sailing through the north-west passage. After a difficult night, the crew were dismayed to find themselves {{at the mouth of the}} sound once more. But the wind blew from the south-east, and San Juan de Bautista finally escaped on 25 September and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>home</b> to Spain through a terrible storm.|$|E
25|$|On the {{previous}} day, {{the governor of}} New York had {{decided to use the}} National Guard and the New York State Department of Transportation (NYDOT) to help clean up snow in the City of Buffalo, not knowing a blizzard would hit. Some NYDOT equipment had arrived in Buffalo while the National Guard was not yet mobilized, but a meeting was being held at the Buffalo city garage that morning to coordinate the efforts. Before the meeting finished, Buffalo city plows started to return to the garage {{due to a lack of}} visibility; they reported they were unable to see even their own plow blades. By 11:30 am, most workers in the City of Buffalo had been released early, but few <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>home.</b> At 11:35 am, lightning was seen in the darkening sky.|$|E
25|$|The Tigers {{began their}} match {{one day before}} Australia and Sri Lanka faced off in the VB Series, and {{recorded}} their first win since November; the Bushrangers, by contrast, hadn't lost since November. The first-innings third-wicket stand between Michael Di Venuto and Travis Birt of the Tigers was worth 143, eight more than Victoria managed in their first innings, and though Cameron White and Shane Warne scored half-centuries for Victoria the second time around, they fell 121 short of their target of 409. In Sydney, the Warriors batted to nine for 508 thanks to centuries from Marcus North (151 not out) and Luke Ronchi (100), and Steve Magoffin and Brett Dorey then took three wickets each as the Blues were bowled out for 117. The second time around, the Blues made 478, but despite three wickets from spinner Jason Krejza the Warriors <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>home</b> with six wickets to spare.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the fleet}} – 84 ships – avoided land, {{and most of those}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>home,</b> {{although}} in varying degrees of distress. The remainder were forced toward the coast of Ireland [...] - perhaps 28 - and included several galleons and many merchantmen. The latter had been converted for battle and were leaking heavily, making sail with severely damaged masts and rigging, and with most of their anchors missing. The ships seem to have maintained contact until the beginning of September, when they were scattered by a south-west gale (described in the contemporary account of an Irish government official as one [...] "the like whereof hath not been seen or heard for a long time"). Within days, this lost fleet had made landfall in Ireland.|$|E

2500|$|With Monroe and Lester Flatt, Scruggs {{performed}} on the Grand Ole Opry and in September 1946 recorded the classic hit [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky"; a song that was designated by the Library of Congress {{to be added to}} the National Recording Registry, and later added to the Grammy Hall of Fame. The work schedule was heavy in Monroe's band. They were playing a lot of jobs in movie theaters all over the south, riding in a 1941 Chevrolet from town to town, doing up to six shows a day and not finishing up until about eleven at night. Lester Flatt said, [...] "It wasn't anything to ride two or three days in a car. We didn't have buses like we do now, and we never had our shoes off". The self-imposed rule was to always get back in time to play the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville each Saturday night. Scruggs said of Monroe that [...] "Bill would never let the music go down no matter how tired we were. If a man would slack off, he would move over and get that mandolin up close on him and get him back up there". Despite the group's success, Scruggs decided the demands were too great. He was single at the time, and the brief few hours on Saturdays that he <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>home,</b> it was just to pack his suitcase at the Tulane Hotel where he lived alone, then repeat the cycle—he had done this for two years. He turned in his resignation, planning to go take care of his mother in North Carolina. [...] Flatt had also made up his mind to leave but he had not told anyone. He later gave his two-week notice but, before the notice was up, the bass player Howard Watts announced that he was leaving too. [...] Despite Monroe's pleading, they left the band. Monroe thought Flatt and Scruggs had a secret understanding, but both men denied it. Monroe did not speak to either one for 20 years thereafter, a feud well known in country music circles.|$|E

And {{if there had been}} I should have got the worst of it. Honestly, judge, I couldn't tell you how much I prized being admitted to your house on the terms I was. Don't you think I could appreciate the kindness you all showed me? Before you took me up, I was alone in Tuskingum, but you opened every door in the place for me. You <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>home</b> to me; and you won't believe it, of course, because you're prejudiced; but I felt like a son and brother to you all. I felt towards Mrs. Kenton just as I do towards my own mother. I lost the best friends I ever had when you turned against me. Don't you suppose I've seen the difference here in Tuskingum? Of course, the men pass the time of day with me when we meet, but they don't look me up, and there are more near-sighted girls in this town!" [...] Kenton could not keep the remote dawn of a smile out of his eyes, and Bittridge caught the far-off gleam. [...] "And everybody's been away the whole winter. Not a soul at home, anywhere, and I had to take my chance of surprising Mrs. Dick Kenton when I saw your door open here." [...] He laughed forlornly, as the gleam faded out of Kenton's eye again. [...] "And the worst of it is that my own mother isn't at home to me, figuratively speaking, when I go over to see her at Ballardsville. She got wind of my misfortune, somehow, and when I made a clean breast of it to her, she said she could never feel the same to me till I had made it all right with the Kentons. And when a man's own mother is down on him, judge!" ...|$|E
