40|$|Regionalization {{within the}} glandular {{epithelium}} of araneid silk glands has been revealed by several authors using various experimental methods. The relationship of this regionalization {{to the potential}} complexity of silk is discussed. We also review studies on the regulation of secretory protein synthesis in araneid silk glands, with an unavoidable emphasis on the major <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands,</b> the most frequently studied spider silk glands. A brief discussion {{of the relationship between}} web composition and the nutritional requirements of araneid spiders follows. Lastly, we describe a mechanism which allows juvenile araneid spiders to produce ampullate fibers during proecdysis (the preparatory period before ecdysis), a time when the primary major and <b>minor</b> <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> are being remodeled and are temporarily nonfunctional. Two sets of secondary major and <b>minor</b> <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> function alternately in successive proecdyses. (Only one set is functional in each juvenile stadium.)

40|$|The {{spinning}} {{apparatus and}} silk of Segestria senoculata were studied {{with the use}} of scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy, which confirmed the presence of four categories of spigots connected with four types of spinning glands (i. e., Glandulae ampullaceae major, Glandulae ampullaceae minor, Glandulae piriformes and Glandulae pseudaciniformes). New data about the morphology of spinnerets and spigots were obtained for both the adults and nymphal stages of both sexes. For the first time the silken threads of retreats, signal threads and attachment discs of the members of Segestria were subjected to a detailed SEM study. The data resulting from studying the spinning apparatus of S. senoculata was compared to current knowledge of the silk producing systems of families belonging to the Dysderoidea superfamily. Silks that are emitted from spigots in the course of retreat construction are not (similarly to the other dysderoids) processed by the spider’s legs during the subsequent process of hardening. Apart from the major ampullate glands/spigots, segestriids also possess developed <b>minor</b> <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands.</b> <b>Minor</b> <b>ampullate</b> threads are used by S. senoculata spiders when making their signal threads...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} half of this century, several workers {{observed}} small, seemingly glandular structures attached to the <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> of spiders. Hence, they were termed accessory <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands.</b> In juvenile Araneus cavaticus, two pairs of these structures are present (starting at least with third instars), one pair attached to the major <b>ampullate</b> (MaA) <b>glands</b> and the other pair attached to the <b>minor</b> <b>ampullate</b> (MiA) <b>glands.</b> In adults, two pairs of accessory MaA glands and two pairs of accessory MiA glands are present. The two latter-formed pairs of accessory <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> are clearly the remnants of those <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> which atrophy shortly after adulthood is reached. Morphological similarities between these accessory <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> and those present in juveniles provide an indication that the latter also have their origin in functional <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands.</b> A reduction in the number of <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> following the last molt occurs in many spiders. The reason(s) for these reductions is unknown. In penultimate spiders close to ecdysis, we have observed that while the larger pairs of MaA and MiA glands (those that are retained in the adult) are undergoing molt-related changes which apparently render them nonfunctional, their smaller counterparts are seemingly unaffected and functional. This raises the possibility that the principal role of the smaller <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> may be to assume functions during the pre-ecdysial period which are normally in the domain of the larger <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands.</b> If true, then their degeneration after the last molt would make economic sense...|$|R
40|$|Major <b>ampullate</b> (MaA) and <b>minor</b> <b>ampullate</b> (MiA) silk <b>glands</b> of {{juvenile}} Araneus cavaticus (third to penultimate instars) were examined by dissection {{at various times}} relative to ecdysis. Several days before ecdysis the larger pairs of MaA and MiA glands become non-functional and remain so until ecdysis. Nevertheless, proecdysial spiders are able to drawl ampullate fibres due {{to the presence of}} smaller pairs of MaA and MiA glands which are functional at this time. Indeed, it appears that these smaller <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> are intended for use only during proecdysis. Thus, larger MaA and MiA glands and smaller MaA and MiA glands are typically not used concurrently (a brief transitional period is an exception). The smaller <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> functioning in one juvenile stadium regress in the following stadium and become (what have previously been referred to as) accessory MaA and MiA glands. These non-functional accessory <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> do not re-develop into functional smaller <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> until the following stadium. Thus, a given pair of smaller MaA or MiA glands is only functional in every other juvenile stadium. However, because there are two sets of smaller/accessory MaA and MiA glands which function alternately, the spider is able to produce ampullate fibres during the proecdysial portion of each stadium. A new terminology for the larger, smaller and accessory <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> is proposed which emphasizes the kinship between the two sets of smaller/accessory <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{means by}} which female wolf spiders attach an egg sac to their spinnerets was inves-tigated using {{scanning}} electron microscopy. In four Pardosa species, we observed that silk fibers emerging from <b>ampullate</b> <b>gland</b> spigots had been affixed {{to the surface of}} the egg sac. More specifically, primary (18) and secondary (28) major <b>ampullate</b> (MaA) <b>glands</b> and 18 and 28 <b>minor</b> <b>ampullate</b> (MiA) <b>glands</b> all contributed fibers for this purpose. The diameters of the 28 MaA and 28 MiA fibers were greater than those of the 18 MaA and 18 MiA fibers and, correspondingly, the widths of the 28 ampullate spigots were clearly greater than those of the 18 ampullate spigots. Larger 28 ampullate spigots were also observed in adult females of species from three other lycosid genera. Thus, 28 <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands,</b> which in araneoids function only in juveniles during proecdysis, are not only functional in adult female lycosids (and adult females of several other families), but they appear to play a greater role than the 18 <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> in egg sac attachment. Observations made on the 18 and 28 ampullate spigots of adult females from species belonging to several other families are also presented. Cuticular structures referred to as nubbins and tartipores are present in some spinning fields on spinnerets. A proposal is made for defining these terms by a criterion, namely their different origins, which differs from that applied previously...|$|R

40|$|The major <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> of {{the spider}} Nephila clavipes contain {{approximately}} 0. 2 microliter each of a highly concentrated (approximately 50 %) solution of silk fibroin. Therefore, the reservoir of silk in these glands presents an ideal opportunity to observe prefolded conformations of a protein in its native state. To this end, the structure and conformation of major <b>ampullate</b> <b>gland</b> silk fibroin within the glands {{of the spider}} N. clavipes were examined by 13 C NMR spectroscopy. These results were compared to those from silk protein first drawn from the spinneret and then denatured. The 13 C NMR chemical shifts, along with infrared and circular dichroism data, suggest that the silk fibroin in the glands exists in dynamically averaged helical conformations. Furthermore, {{there is no evidence}} of proline residues in U-(13) C-D-glucose-labeled silk. This transient prefolded "molten fibril" state may correspond to the silk I form found in Bombyx mori silk. There is no evidence of the final beta-sheet structure in the <b>ampullate</b> <b>gland</b> silk fibroin before final silk processing. However, the conformation of silk in the glands appears to be in a highly metastable state, as plasticization with water produces the beta-sheet structure. Therefore, the ducts connecting the <b>ampullate</b> <b>glands</b> to the spinnerets play a larger role in silk processing than previously thought...|$|R
