5|$|In {{the carbon}} cycle, {{methanogen}} archaea remove hydrogen and {{play an important}} role in the decay of organic matter by the populations of microorganisms that act as decomposers in anaerobic ecosystems, such as sediments, <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> sewage-treatment works.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of European agricultural methods, the shores of San Francisco Bay consisted mostly of tidal marshes. Today, the bay has been significantly altered heavily re-engineered to accommodate the needs of water delivery, shipping, agriculture, and urban development, with side effects including the loss of wetlands and {{the introduction}} of contaminants and invasive species. Approximately 85% of those marshes have been lost or destroyed, but about 50 <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> marsh fragments remain. Huge tracts of the marshes were originally destroyed by farmers for agricultural purposes, then repurposed to serve as salt evaporation ponds to produce salt for food and other purposes. Today, regulations limit the destruction of tidal <b>marshes,</b> <b>and</b> large portions are currently being rehabilitated to its natural state.|$|E

5|$|The limpkin {{is a large}} bird in a {{monotypic}} family. It {{is similar}} in appearance to the rails, but skeletally it {{is closer to the}} cranes. It is found in <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> gets its common name from its appearance of limping as it walks.|$|E
5|$|The ruff (Calidris pugnax) is a {{medium-sized}} wading bird that breeds in <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> wet meadows across northern Eurasia. This highly gregarious sandpiper is migratory and sometimes forms huge flocks in its winter grounds, which include southern and western Europe, Africa, southern Asia and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar's {{appearance}} in prehistory was very different. Whereas {{today it is}} surrounded by sea, the water level was much lower in prehistoric times, when the polar ice caps were larger. The current peninsula {{was surrounded by a}} fertile coastal plain, with <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> sand dunes supporting an abundant variety of animals and plants.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{structural}} material was long ago carried off for reuse in buildings in Cley and Blakeney. The surviving ruins are protected as a scheduled monument and Grade II listed building because of their historical importance, {{but there is no}} active management. The ever-present threat from the encroaching sea is likely to accelerate following a realignment of the Glaven's course through the <b>marshes,</b> <b>and</b> lead to the loss of the ruins.|$|E
5|$|The {{bog turtle}} is native {{only to the}} eastern United States, congregating in colonies that often consist of fewer than 20individuals. They prefer {{calcareous}} wetlands (areas containing lime), including meadows, bogs, <b>marshes,</b> <b>and</b> spring seeps, that have both wet and dry regions. Their habitat is often {{on the edge of}} woods. Bog turtles have sometimes been seen in cow pastures and near beaver dams.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{is home to}} American beavers, as well {{as great}} blue heron, swans, snow geese, common loons, and many other types of waterfowl, with Canada goose, ring-necked duck, mallard, and wood duck the most {{commonly}} seen. The bogs, <b>marshes,</b> <b>and</b> swamps contain frogs and salamanders, and provide a habitat for carnivorous plants like the pitcher plant and sundew. Black Moshannon State Park is home to many common species of songbirds, including ovenbirds.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} settlements {{that are}} still present within Bishop's Caundle parish are Bishop's Caundle and Wake Caundle. Until 1886 the parish contained parts of the neighbouring parish of Caundle <b>Marsh,</b> <b>and</b> there were parts of Bishop's Caundle parish within Caundle <b>Marsh</b> <b>and</b> Folke parishes.|$|R
5000|$|The site {{is located}} one {{mile from the}} center of Tyngsborough near the Dunstable border. Additionally, the {{landfill}} is bordered by a 16-acre <b>marsh</b> <b>and</b> 61-acre pond to the east, dubbed Flint Pond <b>Marsh</b> <b>and</b> Flint Pond respectively, and the Dunstable Brook to the west.|$|R

5|$|The {{northern}} pintail's breeding {{habitat is}} open unwooded wetlands, such as wet grassland, lakesides or tundra. In winter, it will utilise {{a wider range}} of open habitats, such as sheltered estuaries, brackish <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> coastal lagoons. It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season and forms very large mixed flocks with other ducks.|$|E
5|$|Banksia telmatiaea, {{commonly}} known as swamp fox banksia or rarely marsh banksia, is a shrub that grows in <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> swamps along the lower west coast of Australia. It grows as an upright bush up to 2m (7ft) tall, with narrow leaves and a pale brown flower spike, which can produce profuse quantities of nectar. First collected in the 1840s, it was not published as a separate species until 1981; as with several other similar species it was previously included in B.sphaerocarpa (Fox Banksia).|$|E
5|$|Bow Back Rivers or Stratford Back Rivers is {{a complex}} of {{waterways}} between Bow and Stratford in east London, England, which connect the River Lea to the River Thames. Starting in the twelfth century, works were carried out to drain Stratford <b>Marshes</b> <b>and</b> several of the waterways were constructed to power watermills. Bow Creek provided the final outfall to the Thames, and the other channels were called Abbey Creek, Channelsea River, City Mill River, Prescott Channel, Pudding Mill River, Saint Thomas Creek, Three Mills Back River, Three Mills Wall River and Waterworks River.|$|E
50|$|This <b>marsh</b> <b>and</b> fen {{site has}} two ponds {{and a network}} of dykes. The {{wildlife}} is diverse and flowering plants include ragged-robin, yellow flag, <b>marsh</b> marigold <b>and</b> southern <b>marsh</b> orchid. There are birds such as <b>marsh</b> harriers <b>and</b> hen harriers, and mammals include otters and water voles.|$|R

5|$|During the summer, the American white ibis roams {{along the}} coast of tidal flats and {{mangrove}} swamps as the inland marshes are usually flooded. However, as the water level recedes in the fall, populations at the coast shift their foraging area inland, to inland <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> swamplands. It has become more common in urban landscapes in Florida since the late 1990s, and is {{one of a number of}} wetland-dependent bird species which forages in man-made ponds on golf courses in the southwest of the state.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{habitats}} include rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> bogs. Although some {{organisms are}} found across {{most of these}} habitats, the majority have more specific requirements. The water velocity, its temperature and oxygen saturation are important factors, but in river systems, there are fast and slow sections, pools, bayous and backwaters which provide a range of habitats. Similarly, aquatic plants can be floating, semi-submerged, submerged or grow in permanently or temporarily saturated soils besides bodies of water. Marginal plants provide important habitat for both invertebrates and vertebrates, and submerged plants provide oxygenation of the water, absorb nutrients and {{play a part in}} the reduction of pollution.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the <b>marshes,</b> <b>and</b> on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid, lesser centaury and carline thistle flower on the more stable dunes, where the rare Jersey cudweed and grey hair-grass are also found. The narrow 5-km (3-mi) belt of pines shelters creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest.|$|E

5|$|Historically, the East End {{is arguably}} conterminous with the Manor of Stepney. This manor {{was held by}} the Bishop of London, in {{compensation}} for his duties in maintaining and garrisoning the Tower of London. Further ecclesiastic holdings came about from the need to enclose the <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> create flood defences along the Thames. Edward VI passed the land to the Wentworth family, and thence to their descendants, the Earls of Cleveland. The ecclesiastic system of copyhold, whereby land was leased to tenants for terms as short as seven years, prevailed throughout the manor. This severely limited scope for improvement {{of the land and}} new building until the estate was broken up in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lili caused great {{environmental}} {{damage to the}} <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> barrier islands in Louisiana. Huge fish kills were observed in marshes near the landfall point, and in the Atchafalaya Swamp. The barrier islands {{to the east of}} the landfall point, those subjected to the highest surge, were severely eroded. Sand was also deposited behind them into the brackish marshes, burying vegetation. The freshwater marshes were severely damaged by the wind and surge, some of them completely destroyed. The severe erosion created new waterways connecting inland bodies of water with the Gulf of Mexico, which eventually led to further erosion of inland lagoons.|$|E
5|$|Nutria were {{introduced}} into coastal marshes from South America in the mid-1900s, and their population has since exploded into the millions. They cause serious damage to coastal <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> may dig burrows in levees. Hence, Louisiana {{has had a}} bounty to try to reduce nutria numbers. Large American alligators, however, feed heavily on nutria, so American alligators may not only control nutria populations in Louisiana, but also prevent them spreading east into the Everglades. Since hunting and trapping preferentially take the large American alligators that {{are the most important}} in eating nutria, some changes in harvesting may be needed to capitalize on their ability to control nutria.|$|E
