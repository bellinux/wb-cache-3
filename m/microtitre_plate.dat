Mfinity-puri:fied antibodies to bovine lactoferrin were prepared and conjugated to horseradish peroxidase by the periodate method. Conjugates with enzymatic and immunological activity had an apparent molecular weight of 65 or 95 kd. Four methods of ELISA on <b>microtitre</b> <b>plates</b> and three dot assays were developed. ii Differences between the seven assays {{could be attributed to}} the absorption capacity of the solid phase and the types of conjugates and substrates used.

More replicates would be required to reduce variability. Results from these assays generally corresponded to results from ROCKET electrophoresis. Dot assay on nitrocellulose has a greater potential for reproducible and quantitative assays than assay on <b>microtitre</b> <b>plates,</b> because of the greater adsorption capacity of the nitrocellulose.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{reliable}} sero-diagnostic tests for coeliac disease (CD) is the measurement, by ELISA, of serum IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) adsorbed to the wells of <b>microtitre</b> <b>plates.</b> In spite of its reliability, however, some discrepancies exist with the results obtained by the antiendomysium histological assay (EMA) and by biopsy the accepted gold standard. Among the reasons for these differences in titres between the ELISA and the last 2 mentioned assays are the conformational changes that proteins undergo on adsorption {{and the importance of}} conformational epitopes on tTG for diagnosing CD.

Comparison of the IgA titres obtained by immunocapture with those by EMA and ELISA (adsorbed tTG) on 9 highly positive and 6 weakly positive sera from clinically characterized CD patients and 5 negative sera from non-CD control subjects revealed that the IgA titres by the immunocapture procedure were well correlated with those obtained by EMA, whereas the titres on ELISA showed discrepancies with both immunocapture and EMA...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{medicine}} {{has a long}} history of being used for treating various ailments ranging in severity. Although traditional {{medicine has}} typically been the health care for the poorest levels of society, there is a worldwide growth in popularity. The growing popularity of traditional medicine, termed the green boom, may be ascribed to people taking a more holistic approach to maintain their health. Traditional medicine is widely used on a regular basis by 70 % of South Africans. Various indigenous medicinal plants are used for the preparation of traditional herbal medicine. These plants are mostly indigenous to the regions were it is used. In this study four medicinal plants (Bulbine frutescens, Leonotis leounurus, Melianthus major & Zantedecshia aethiopica) that are traditionally used in the Eastern Cape region for treating burn wound infections, were collected for investigation. The in vitro antibacterial activity of these plants was tested against different bacterial strains of eight different bacteria. The bacteria used in this investigation included bacterial strains of four Gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), E. feacalis, S. pyogenes and four Gramnegative bacteria, P. aeruginosa, A. baumanii, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis. Traditional preparations as well as three different extracts (methanol, aqueous & acetone) of the plants were used for in vitro antibacterial activity testing. The <b>microtitre</b> <b>plate</b> assay and agar dilution assay were used for determining the antibacterial activity of the traditional preparations and plant extracts against the different bacterial strains. In the <b>microtitre</b> <b>plate</b> assay the antibacterial activity was tested using the bacterial growth indicator, INT and a <b>microtitre</b> <b>plate</b> spectrophotometer to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations of the plant extracts and traditional preparations. The <b>microtitre</b> <b>plate</b> assay was used for testing the antibacterial activity of the plants against the bacterial strains of five bacteria, S. aureus, MRSA, P. aeruginosa, A. baumanii and K. pneumoniae. The bacterial strains of the three bacteria, S. pyogenes, E. feacalis and P. mirabilis were not compatible with the <b>microtitre</b> <b>plate</b> assay using INT and spectrophotometric readings to determine bacterial inhibition. Therefore the agar dilution assay were used as an alternative method for determining the MIC’s of the plant extracts against the bacterial strains of these bacteria. The initial plant extract concentration in the <b>microtitre</b> <b>plate</b> assay differed with the different plant extracts in the <b>microtitre</b> <b>plate</b> assay. Acetone followed by methanol extracted the highest plant extract concentrations with the different medicinal plants. M. major followed by L. leonurus produced the highest plant extract concentrations following extraction with the different extraction solvents. Consequently the acetone extract of M. major had the highest plant extract concentration before serial dilution in the <b>microtitre</b> <b>plate</b> assay. Uniform plant extract concentrations were tested in the agar dilution assay. The methanol extract followed by the acetone extract of the plants gave the highest antibacterial activity against the different bacterial strains. The extracts of M. major followed by L. leonurus inhibited the highest number of bacterial strains in the <b>microtitre</b> <b>plate</b> assay and the extracts of B. frutescens inhibited the lowest number of bacterial strains. The acetone and methanol extracts of M. major were the only extracts that displayed antibacterial activity in the agar dilution assay. The bacterial strains of P. mirabilis were the only bacteria that were inhibited using this method. The bacterial strains of S. pyogenes and E. feacalis were not inhibited at any of the plant extract concentrations in the agar dilution assay...|$|E

Within analytical studies, measurement of the electrokinesis of biological cells has the sensitivity and selectivity to distinguish subtle differences between cell types and cells undergoing changes and is gaining acceptance as a diagnostic tool in high throughput screening for drug discovery applications.
