30|$|We have {{proposed}} a viscoelastic response following the 2008 IMNE which continues for more than 2.2 years. A simple two-layered model consisting of an elastic layer having a thickness of 19 to 23.5 km and an underlying Maxwell viscoelastic layer with a viscosity of 2.4 – 4.8 × 1018 Pa s explains the far-field deformation pattern. The elastic layer thickness agrees with the deeper limit of crustal seismicity in the study area. The estimated viscosity is approximately consistent with values reported in previous studies. A detailed study considering the highly-heterogeneous viscoelastic structure, which corresponds to a seismic velocity anomaly, and/or <b>multiple</b> <b>causalities,</b> {{in addition to the}} viscoelastic response, is indispensable for understanding the overall postseismic process in the study area, leading to an understanding of island arc deformation in subduction zones.|$|R

50|$|Edelman {{used the}} terms {{reentrant}} and degenerate {{in order to}} describe these complex neural connections. Reentrant {{was defined as a}} complex interwoven system in which the output can feed back into the input. Reentry is a two way straight that can run in parallel.

This joint determination by <b>multiple</b> <b>causality</b> is one major theme of developmental systems theory that also overlaps with the dynamical systems theory by Esther Thelen. An example of how multiple causes can lead to one action is human movement. In the body, the brain can send many different signals to cause movements such as speech.

50|$|Multiple {{hypotheses}} {{attempt to}} explain the evolution of female choice. Some of these suggest direct benefits to females, such as protection, shelter, or nuptial gifts that sway the female's choice of mate. Another hypothesis is that females choose mates with good genes. Males with more exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics, such as bigger, brighter peacock trains, tend to have better genes in the peahen's eyes. These better genes will directly benefit her offspring, {{as well as her}} fitness and reproductive success. Runaway selection also seeks to clarify the evolution of the peacock's train. In runaway sexual selection, linked genes in males and females code for sexually dimorphic traits in males, and preference for those traits in females. The close spatial association of alleles for loci involved in the train in males, and for preference for more exuberant trains in females, on the chromosome (linkage disequilibrium) causes a positive feedback loop that exaggerates both the male traits and the female preferences. Another hypothesis is sensory bias, in which females have a preference for a trait in a non-mating context that becomes transferred to mating. <b>Multiple</b> <b>causality</b> for the evolution of female choice is also possible.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are four}} main themes that {{underline}} the complex systems within biogeomorphology.The {{first of which}} is <b>multiple</b> <b>causality.</b> Multiple casualty {{is the way in}} which biota is deposited. More specifically, multiple casualty is caused by various processes. That is, processes such as fires, floods and hillslope instability directly or indirectly determining the distribution of flora and in turn fauna. Ecosystem engineers are another theme underlying complex system of biogeomorphology. These organisms have the most profound effect on the overall ecosystem structure. Some of the most common ecosystem engineers are earthworms. Earthworms aid in the production of humus and increase both soil aeration and area for roots and root hairs to utilize. With more space for roots, this can increase soil stability. Another strong example of ecosystem engineers are beavers. Beavers can increase the sedimentation in a channel as well as increase runoff rates due to a reduction of vegetative cover needed to build their dams.Ecological topology is another theme of complex systems in biogeomorphology. This theme focuses on how the biota varies based on geographic location.This ecological topology is controlled by a concept called stability domain. Stability domain describes the interaction of a set species and certain abiotic factors that act as a medium to the function and structure of an environment. The final of the four underlying themes of the complex systems in biogeomorphology is ecological memory. Ecological memory is where certain biotic and abiotic factors have a recursive relationship and therefore can be encoded in organisms and the immediate environment. An example of this can simply be the flame retardant properties in the bark of Coastal Sequoias due to the recurrence of fires ...|$|E

Investigating causal relations by econometric models and cross-spectral methods, Econometrica 37, 424 - 459] {{is defined in}} terms of predictability one period ahead.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{causality}} introduced by Wiener (1956) and Granger (1969) {{is defined in}} terms of predictability one period ahead. This concept can be generalized by considering causality at a given horizon h, and causality up to any given horizon h [Dufour and Renault (1998) ]. This generalization is motivated by the fact that, in the presence of an auxiliary variable vector Z, it is possible that a variable Y does not cause variable X at horizon 1, but causes it at horizon h > 1. In this case, there is an indirect causality transmitted by Z. Another related problem consists in measuring the importance of causality between two variables. Existing causality measures have been defined only for the horizon 1 and fail to capture indirect causal effects. This paper proposes a generalization of such measures for any horizon h. We propose nonparametric and parametric measures of unidirectional and instantaneous causality at any horizon h. Parametric measures are defined in the context of autoregressive processes of unknown order and expressed in terms of impulse response coefficients. On noting that causality measures typically involve complex functions of model parameters in VAR and VARMA models, we propose a simple method to evaluate these measures which is based on the simulation of a large sample from the process of interest. We also describe asymptotically valid nonparametric confidence intervals, using a bootstrap technique. Finally, the proposed measures are applied to study causality relations at different horizons between macroeconomic, monetary and financial variables in the U. S. These results show that there is a strong effect of nonborrowed reserves on federal funds rate one month ahead, the effect of real gross domestic product on federal funds rate is economically important for the first three months, the effect of federal funds rate on gross domestic product deflator is economically weak one month ahead, and finally federal fundsrate causes the real gross domestic product until 16 months.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{exploration}} is to try {{to summarise}} what is commonly accepted when analysing the relationships between land use and transportation. The interaction between land use and transportation composes the land-use/transportation system. A large research body exists on the impact of land-use systems on travel behaviour (for reviews, e. g., Handy, 2002; Stead and Marshall, 2001; Crane, 2000; Wegener and Fürst, 1999). In order to obtain a clear overview, a three-fold distinction has been made based on type of variable included. Thus, three dimensions in travel behaviour research have been found: (i) a spatial dimension, (ii) a socio-economic dimension, and (iii) a behavioural dimension. Less is known about the reverse relationship, i. e., the impact of the transportation system on location decisions of households and firms (the land-use system). The greater part of this research utilizes “accessibility” as an intermediate concept to measure the influence of the transportation system on the land-use system. The presented literature review enabled us to detect some gaps in the knowledge on the land-use/transportation system. Understanding the interaction between land use and travel behaviour involves having (i) data on land-use patterns; on the socio-economic background of individuals; and on their attitudes, perceptions and preferences toward land use and travel; and (ii) a methodology dealing with potential <b>multiple</b> directions of <b>causality.</b> The first issue can be achieved by combining empirical, revealed, and stated-preference research. The second methodological question can be solved using structural equation modelling (SEM). This is a modelling technique which can handle a large number of independent and dependent variables, as well as <b>multiple</b> directions of <b>causality.</b> These characteristics of SEM seem useful in order to obtain an improved insight in the complex nature of travel behaviour.
