Sphagnum palustre, a bog moss, was purposely introduced to what is now the Ka'ala Natural Area Reserve on O'ahu in the 1960 's from the Kohala area of the Big Island of Hawai'i, where it is indigenous. Though S. palustre cannot produce spores, over a 43 fold increase {{in the size of the}} core infestation has been observed between 1997 and 2013. Through vegetative reproduction, S. palustre now occupies an area estimated at 17. 3 acres. When exposed to three herbicides SAFER Moss & Algae Killer, Lilly Miller Worry Free Moss & Algae Control and St. Gabriel's <b>Moss</b> <b>Killer</b> (SGMK) in a greenhouse setting, S. palustre only responded to SGMK. It contains the active ingredients clove oil and sodium lauryl sulfate. In a growth chamber, we tested extremely low doses of SGMK (the recommended label rate is 25 - 33 % SGMK diluted in water), between 0. 3 - 5. 0 % concentration SGMK solution in water, on healthy S. palustre. Within 48 hours 100 % mortality was achieved at concentrations greater than or equal to 1. 2 % SGMK solution. In the field, we treated S. palustre with a 2. 5, 5 and 7. 5 % SGMK solution. The solution was applied at a rate of one liter solution per meter square of moss. Results nine months post-treatment showed only the highest concentration SGMK tested (7. 5 %) significantly reduced S. palustre cover over the control group. Even this dose left close to half of the target pest alive (mean survival = 49 % + 11 % SEM). From this work, we concluded that higher field doses were needed to achieve adequate moss control. To compare the efficacy of manual removal of moss against that achieved using a 10 % and 20 % solution of SGMK and to evaluate impacts to non-target species, we established 40, one meter square plots within the infestation (10 replicates per treatment plus a control). Impacts to non-target species were measured using stem counts of plants less than one meter. A significant reduction in Metrodsideros polymorpha was evident at the 20 % SGMK concentration. Though differences were not significant, reductions in the other three common native species measured (Cibotium spp., Dianella sandwicensis and Vaccinium calycinum) were, on average, higher in the manual removal and 20 % SGMK treatments compared to either the control or 10 % SGMK group at six months. At 1. 5 years, all three treatments effectively reduced S. palustre cover compared to the control group. Given that the 10 % SGMK was found to be as effective as the higher dose and exhibited fewer non-target impacts, this is the treatment currently recommended and being actively used for control of S. palustre. This technical report was the result of a Cooperative Agreement between the US Army (W 9126 G- 10 - 2 - 0034) and the Pacific Islands Center for High Technology Research). We thank our cooperators at the Department of Land and Natural Resources: Talbert Takahama, Amanda Hardman, Marigold Zoll and Betsy Gagne. We also appreciated the work of Benjamin Welborn from St. Gabriel Organics Laboratory who gave us valuable input on how to apply St. Gabriel’s <b>Moss</b> <b>Killer</b> for maximum efficacy. Our gratitude also goes out to Dr. David Beilman of University of Hawai‘i Mānoa, who is continuing to work on S. palustre impacts. We also thank our many volunteers especially our A-Team of Sphagnum Eradicators: Kathy Altz, David Danzeiser, Roy Kikuta, Laurie Loomis and Elaine Mahoney...|$|E

5000|$|In November 1884 amid {{rumors of}} an {{improper}} {{relationship with a}} Katherine Merrill Graydon, a professor of Greek at Indiana University, Moss resigned abruptly as President of Indiana University. Affidavits were presented to the Board of Trustees detailing the inappropriate behavior observed between the two by students M. W. Fordyce and Ed.

The affidavits states the two witnessed Moss and Graydon kissing and hugging as well Graydon sitting on Moss' lap in her office. These two were members of a group that called themselves the <b>Moss</b> <b>Killers</b> along with four fellow students and janitor Thomas Spicer. The group had drilled a hole in the ceiling of Graydon's office in order to observe her and Moss. Given the resignation of those involved, the Board of Trustees decided against continuing the investigation of the charges.|$|R
25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} two shows in the continuity, Models Inc. did not experience any significant changes in character focus or tone. Instead, the writers chose to explore the ensemble cast from the start and immediately present the kind of story lines that had made Melrose Place famous. The initial focus of the series was a mystery surrounding the murder of model Teri Spencer (Stephanie Romanov), who'd announced her intentions to leave the agency. For a number of episodes throughout the first story arc, suspects included Hillary, Teri's ex-boyfriend Brian (Cameron Daddo), Teri's rival Julie (Kylie Travis), and Teri's own sister Carrie (Carrie-Anne <b>Moss).</b> Once the <b>killer</b> was revealed, the characters moved on, with their focus switching {{to the arrival of}} Stephanie Romanov's new character Monique, a model who was a nearly dead ringer for Teri. The remainder of the series largely centered around the models' growing relationships with their boyfriends and each other, while also dealing with the issues of substance abuse and the pressures of the business. Primary antagonists included several figures from the models' pasts—including a stalker, a jealous sister, and Grayson (Emma Samms), the cunning and powerful ex-wife of Monique's fiance.|$|R
