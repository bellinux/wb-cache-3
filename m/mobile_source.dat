25|$|D9016 (55 016) Gordon Highlander was {{purchased}} by the Deltic 9000 Fund, with the intention {{that it would be}} restored to running condition, whilst acting as a 'twelve wheeled <b>mobile</b> <b>source</b> of spares'. It was moved to Wansford, on the Nene Valley Railway to join D9000, where the temptation to restore it to operational condition became too great to resist. Eventually, like D9000, the locomotive left the railway for the Network SouthEast depots at Selhurst and Old Oak Common. After D9000 had been operating on the main line for three years {{the decision was made to}} overhaul and recertify D9016, to provide cover for Royal Scots Grey, and the locomotive was moved to Brush Traction at Loughborough. Following overhaul it spent a short period on the main line, on charter work, its operation sponsored by Porterbrook Leasing, in recognition of which it was painted in their purple and grey house colours, based upon the original two-tone green style. It lasted in this livery until 2002, when the original two-tone green livery was reapplied. Following the demise of Deltic 9000 Locomotives Limited the locomotive {{was purchased}} and based at the Peak Rail (Heritage Railway), near Bakewell, Derbyshire. In July 2008, this locomotive was sold by the private owner to HNRC, as a business venture. In spite of previous announcements to the contrary, HNRC put the locomotive up for sale at the end of September 2008. Bids from the Gordon Highlander Preservation Group and Beaver Sports (Yorks) Ltd. (the owners of 55 022) were rejected by HNRC in favour of a higher offer from Direct Rail Services (DRS) Ltd. Direct Rail Services (DRS) Ltd kept D9016 at Barrow Hill for a year with the intention of a full overhaul but these plans never surfaced. The locomotive was sold one year later to Beaver Sports (Yorks) Ltd. and it was based at East Lancashire Railway with 55 022. The aim is to return D9016 to mainline condition once again. D9016 donated one of its two engines to 55 022 in April 2010 to replace one of 55 022's engines, a former marine example that had been temporarily fitted to 55 022 following an earlier engine failure. During 2014 D9016 left the East Lancashire Railway for the Great Central Railway. In January 2015 the locomotive moved to the Washwood Heath site of Boden Rail, for bodywork repairs.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} <b>mobile</b> <b>sources</b> of air pollution, some contributing more to pollution than others.

Different <b>mobile</b> <b>sources</b> operate differently and generate different emission types and levels.

5000|$|A mobile {{emission}} reduction credit (MERC) is an {{emission reduction}} credit generated within the transportation sector. The term “mobile sources” refers to motor vehicles, engines, and equipment that move, {{or can be}} moved, from place to place. <b>Mobile</b> <b>sources</b> include vehicles that operate on roads and highways ("on-road" [...] or [...] "highway" [...] vehicles), as well as nonroad vehicles, engines, and equipment. Examples of <b>mobile</b> <b>sources</b> are passenger cars, light trucks, large trucks, buses, motorcycles, earth-moving equipment, nonroad recreational vehicles (such as dirt bikes and snowmobiles), farm and construction equipment, cranes, lawn and garden power tools, marine engines, ships, railroad locomotives, and airplanes. In California, <b>mobile</b> <b>sources</b> account for about 60 percent of all ozone forming emissions and for over 90 percent of all carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from all sources.|$|R
40|$|Ambient {{concentrations}} of pollutants are correlated with emissions, but the contribution to {{ambient air quality}} of on-road <b>mobile</b> <b>sources</b> is not necessarily equal to their contribution to regional emissions. This is true for several reasons such as the distribution of other pollution sources and regional topology, as well as meteorology. In this paper, using a dataset from a travel demand model for the Sacramento metropolitan area for 2005, regional vehicle emissions are disaggregated into hourly, gridded emission inventories, and transportation- related concentrations are estimated using an atmospheric dispersion model. Contributions of on-road motor vehicles to urban air pollution are then identified at a regional scale. The contributions to ambient concentrations are slightly higher than emission fractions that transportation accounts for in the region, reflecting that relative to other major pollution <b>sources,</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>sources</b> {{tend to have a}} close proximity to air quality monitors in urban areas. The contribution results indicate that the impact of <b>mobile</b> <b>sources</b> on PM 10 is not negligible, and <b>mobile</b> <b>sources</b> have a significant influence on both NOx and VOC pollution that subsequently results in secondary particulate matter and ozone formation.

In addition to air toxics monitoring Jacksonville began calculating hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emission inventories for point, area and <b>mobile</b> <b>sources.</b> Air monitoring data indicated ten HAPs were continually {{present at the}} majority of the air toxics monitoring sites and have consistently high average annual concentrations in comparison with other monitored pollutants. These HAPs were chosen for further study. HAP inventory data from the year 2000 was compiled based on Source Classification Code to determine which source categories were emitting these HAPs. Results indicate the majority of emissions appear to be from <b>mobile</b> <b>sources</b> and the least emissions from point <b>sources.</b> On-road <b>mobile</b> <b>sources</b> are a significant contributor to at least five HAPs found from air monitoring. Non-road <b>mobile</b> <b>sources</b> are also a significant contributor. At least seven of the HAPs are emitted from point and area source surface coating operations. Degreasing and consumer/commercial solvent use are significant contributors for at least six of the monitored HAPs. Other significant contributors include dry cleaning and gasoline use. This study has aided Jacksonville in determining which types of facilities are contributing to ambient levels of particular HAPs. This data can be used to develop local regulatory efforts to minimize emissions and for risk analysis modeling. Future HAP emission inventories and air toxics monitoring will aid in establishing trends over time, which can be used to determine the success of regulatory efforts...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{literature}} sources have attributed varying contributions from <b>mobile</b> <b>sources</b> {{to the current}} PM 2. 5 ambient concentration levels. PM 2. 5 emissions from <b>mobile</b> <b>sources</b> are generated from three general processes: 1) it is directly emitted from the tailpipes of cars, trucks and other on-road vehicles, 2) it is re-entrained from materials found on the roadway (typically known as fugitive dust), and 3) it is created by secondary formation from precursor emissions such as sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ammonia (NH 3). Items 1 and 2 are generally known as primary emissions of PM 2. 5. Secondary formation occurs due to chemical reaction in the atmosphere generally downwind {{some distance from the}} original emission source. Efforts to determine the contribution of each of these PM 2. 5 emission mechanisms has shown a great deal of variability, as seen from an examination of current literature. A thorough review of current literature pertaining to PM 2. 5 emissions from <b>mobile</b> and other <b>sources</b> provides a foundation for comparison and contrast of the chemical and physical mechanisms involved in emission and formation of PM 2. 5.
