In the 1970s, instruction of the Sami language started in schools, and a new sense of consciousness started to grow among the Sami; today <b>most</b> are <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> their background and culture.|$|R

He met adversity with strength, rudeness with grace, and challenges with enthusiasm.

He then moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of finding greater fame: [...] "I tap danced like you wouldn't believe ... trying to get something ... If I'd have had a gun back then, I would have shot myself". Soon after, O'Neal travelled to England after he was [...] "essentially thrown out of America" [...] as he could not earn enough money, and was unwilling to yield to the demands of club owners that he change his confrontational act. O'Neal worked hard to gain the respect of his peers and recalled it took around five months [...] "for them to go 'Ok, this guy's not playing around". It was also during this time that O'Neal caught the eye of English comedian Ricky Gervais, still early in his own stand-up career, who cites O'Neal as a favourite of his.

Besides the inhabitants of Ronda {{and some of his}} own tribe, he had a legion of African Moors in his immediate service. They were of the tribe of the Gomeres, so called from their native mountains--mercenary troops whose hot African blood had not yet been tempered by the softer living of Spain, and whose whole business was to fight. These he kept always well armed and well appointed. The rich pasturage of the valley of Ronda produced a breed of horses famous for strength and speed; no cavalry, therefore, was better mounted than the band of Gomeres. Rapid on the march, fierce in the attack, it would sweep down upon the Andalusian plains like a sudden blast from the mountains, and pass away as suddenly before there was time for pursuit.|$|R

This remarkable trend made possible the rapid economic growth that produced a rising standard of living for most American families (Goldin & Katz, 2008).

5000|$|Before Ketchum {{turned his}} pen to novel writing, he sold a {{prolific}} amount of short fiction and articles to magazines. His initial pen name, Jerzy Livingston, came about during this period. Because he often {{had more than}} one piece published in a specific magazine he would use his own name for the first byline and then adopt a pseudonym for the others. He came from Livingston, New Jersey and, at the time, had been reading work by the author Jerzy Kosinski: [...] "I liked the in-joke. Hence, Jerzy Livingston." [...] he explains. One of his best known characters while writing as Jerzy Livingstone is Stroup, a play on Proust: Stroup, however, had zero understanding of people, even himself. Ketchum refers to Stroup as [...] "a boozer. a loser. a homophobe. A highly questionable friend and unreliable lover. Misogynist as hell and for the <b>most</b> part <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] Stroup is the exact opposite of Proust, whom Ketchum calls [...] "arguably the most sensitive writer in history". Stroup appeared in the men's magazine Swank. He was recently resurrected in the tale [...] "Sheep Meadow Story" [...] that formed part of the book Triage (2001), a collection with Richard Laymon and Edward Lee. His exploits can be found collected in Broken on the Wheel of Sex: The Jerzy Livingston Years (2007).|$|R

One little fellow was known to go to bed an hour or two earlier that he might be six years old the sooner! But some dreaded the good order enforced by the stick. There was one boy in particular, who had outgrown the girls' school, and was very troublesome there. He would not go to the boys', and his mother would not make him, saying she feared he would fall into the water. [...] "Well," [...] said Mrs. Bargus, who was a most bright, kindly old lady of eighty, [...] "I'll make him go." [...] So she took a large piece of yellow glazed calico intended for furniture lining, walked up to school, and held it up to the little boy. She said she heard that he would only go to the girls' school, and, since everybody went there in petticoats, she had brought some stuff to make him a petticoat too! The young man got up and walked straight off to the boys' school.|$|R

The book had been a dream of his since childhood, and he claimed that he had found a manuscript detailing the life of Joan of Arc when he was an adolescent.

Although the Court decided that the legislative act requiring Senatorial consent to such removal was unconstitutional, it thanked him for his service and he believed the decision vindicated President Andrew Johnson's position with respect to the Tenure of Office Act, and that the powerful dissent by Justices Holmes, McReynolds and Brandeis might eventually receive favorable future reconsideration. Pepper also took pride in his handling of the George Otis Smith case (concerning the Federal Power Commission), where Pepper vindicated Presidential rights against the Senate, having refused a senatorial delegation's offer to represent them but accepting that of Attorney General Mitchell.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Winslow Taylor (March 20, 1856 – March 21, 1915) was an American {{mechanical}} engineer {{who sought to}} improve industrial efficiency. He {{was one of the}} first management consultants. Taylor was one of the intellectual leaders of the Efficiency Movement and his ideas, broadly conceived, were highly influential in the Progressive Era (1890s-1920s). Taylor summed up his efficiency techniques in his 1911 book The Principles of Scientific Management, which in 2001 Fellows of the Academy of Management voted the most influential management book of the twentieth century. His pioneering work in applying engineering principles to the work done on the factory floor was instrumental in the creation and development of the branch of engineering that is now known as industrial engineering. Taylor made his name in, and was <b>most</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his work in, scientific management; however, he made his fortune patenting steel-process improvements.
