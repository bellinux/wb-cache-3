5|$|Dementia with Lewy bodies {{is another}} synucleinopathy {{and it has}} close {{pathological}} similarities with PD, especially with the subset of PD cases with dementia. The relationship between PD and DLB is complex and incompletely understood. They may represent parts of a continuum with variable distinguishing clinical and pathological features or they <b>may</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> separate diseases.|$|E
5|$|Crude glyphs {{have been}} found on a few stone objects and some {{additional}} wooden items, {{but most of these}} are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality craftsmanship (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having been carved with a steel blade (K, V, and Y), and thus, although they <b>may</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> genuine, should not be trusted in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, but it may be a palimpsest on an authentic but now illegible text.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{reports that}} the {{wreckage}} of the aircraft had been located late on Tuesday evening (18 <b>May)</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> false, and the search continued late on Wednesday 19 May. Afghan police, local people and International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) helicopters were involved in the search. The rugged, mountainous terrain, fog and snow again hampered the search. On 20 May, it was announced that the tail section of the aircraft had been spotted.|$|R
5|$|The Kuiper belt {{is a great}} ring {{of debris}} similar to the {{asteroid}} belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice. It extends between 30 and 50AU from the Sun. Though it is estimated to contain anything from dozens to thousands of dwarf planets, it is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies. Many of the larger Kuiper belt objects, such as Quaoar, Varuna, and Orcus, <b>may</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dwarf planets with further data. There {{are estimated to be}} over 100,000 Kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than 50km, but the total mass of the Kuiper belt is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth. Many Kuiper belt objects have multiple satellites, and most have orbits that take them outside the plane of the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|Von Helversen and Heller {{argued that}} none of the old names now {{considered}} synonyms of M.mystacinus could apply to M.alcathoe, because these names all have their type localities in western or central Europe. However, the more recent discovery of M.alcathoe further to the west renders it possible that an older name may be discovered. In addition, Russian researcher Suren Gazaryan has suggested that the name caucasicus Tsytsulina, 2000 (originally proposed for a subspecies of M.mystacinus from the Caucasus) <b>may</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applicable to M. alcathoe; in that case, the species would be renamed Myotis caucasicus. The species may have remained undetected in Germany for so long because bat researchers did not sample its preferred habitats and would dismiss unusual-looking whiskered bats as being abnormal M.mystacinus or M.brandtii.|$|E

25|$|Lucilia cuprina also {{causes the}} {{condition}} known as 'sheep strike'. The female fly locates a sheep {{with an open}} wound in which she lays her eggs. The emerging larvae cause large lesions on the sheep, which <b>may</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fatal.|$|E
25|$|The most {{successful}} hormonal treatments are orchiectomy and GnRH agonists. Despite their higher cost, GnRH agonists are often chosen over orchiectomy for cosmetic and emotional reasons.

25|$|Although {{during the}} last decade {{connecting}} main routes inside the city has been an ongoing project, because of their insufficient lengths, this could not free the city from cross traffic.

25|$|DCC is developmentally regulated, {{being present}} in most fetal tissues {{of the body}} at higher levels than what is found in adult tissues.

50|$|French {{production}} at first lagged behind the British. After August 1916 however, British tank manufacture <b>was</b> temporarily halted <b>to</b> wait for better designs, allowing the French to overtake their allies in numbers. When the French used tanks {{for the first}} time on 16 April 1917, during the Nivelle Offensive, they had four times more tanks available. But that would not last long as the offensive was a major failure; the Schneiders were badly deployed and suffered 50% losses from German long-range artillery. The Saint-Chamond tanks, first deployed on 5 <b>May,</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so badly designed that they <b>were</b> unable <b>to</b> cross the first line of German trenches.|$|R

25|$|One of the {{advantages}} of DNA vaccines is that they are able to induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) without the inherent risk associated with live vaccines. CTL responses can be raised against immunodominant and immunorecessive CTL epitopes, as well as subdominant CTL epitopes, in a manner that appears to mimic natural infection. This <b>may</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a useful tool in assessing CTL epitopes and their role in providing immunity.|$|E
25|$|Amphidromus perversus perversus f. borneensis Pilsbry, 1900, {{is based}} on a stout variant of the interruptus pattern, whitish in {{background}} color, and rather similar to the Javanese subspecies, emaciatus. It was described from South Borneo in the Bandjermassin District (Chicago Natural History Museum 63377), but there are specimens in the Naturalis, Leiden from East Borneo. The flammulations above the periphery are reduced in number. Possibly this <b>may</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a subspecies, but not enough data are available.|$|E

Bowser's support for <b>May</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one of her critical assets, as Bowser turned a portion of her campaign organization over to May—providing her with hundreds of experienced volunteers and up-to-date voter lists. May also benefited from a close association with Phinis Jones, owner of Capitol Services Management.

40|$|The {{breeding}} of mosquito larvae {{in the field}} is determined by the ovipositing behaviour of the gravid females.

25|$|The placebo {{administration}} <b>may</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a useful}} treatment {{in some specific cases}} where recommended drugs cannot be used. For example, burn {{patients who are}} experiencing respiratory problems cannot often be prescribed opioid (morphine) or opioid derivatives (pethidine), as these can cause further respiratory depression. In such cases placebo injections (normal saline, etc.) are of use in providing real pain relief to burn patients if those not in delirium are told they are being given a powerful dose of painkiller.|$|E
25|$|However, how {{sulfatide}} buildup causes demyelination and neural degeneration {{is still}} mostly unknown. Metachromatic Leukodystrophy results in neurological manifestations that are {{centered on the}} impairment of {{the central nervous system}} and the peripheral nervous system, including the following: seizures, progressive coordination and speech problems, and behavioral disturbances. Treatment is still being studied and evaluated, but mice studies indicate that treatments, including gene therapy, cell-based therapies using oligodendrocyte progenitors cells, enzyme replacement therapy, or adeno-associated viral and lentiviral mediated gene therapy <b>may</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective in reducing the effects of Metachromatic Leukodystrophy.|$|E

The prediction <b>may</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an understatement as the decline has exceeded 20 percent from 2012 to 2015. Speculation about Sweden declaring all banknotes and coins invalid at some future date is widespread in the media with Björn Ulvaeus as a celebrity advocate of a cashless Sweden which he believes {{will result in a}} safer society because simple robbery will involve stealing goods that must be fenced.|$|E
