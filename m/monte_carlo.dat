In the two years since the previous workshop there have been significant advances in both soft and hard QCD, particularly in the areas of multi-leg NLO calculations, the inclusion of those NLO calculations into parton shower <b>Monte</b> <b>Carlos,</b> and the tuning of the non-perturbative parameters of those <b>Monte</b> <b>Carlos.</b> These proceedings describe the theoretical advances that have taken place, the impact of the early LHC data, and the areas for future development.

25|$|<b>Monte</b> <b>Carlo</b> {{arithmetic}} is {{a technique}} in <b>Monte</b> <b>Carlo</b> methods where the rounding is randomly up or down. Stochastic rounding {{can be used for}} <b>Monte</b> <b>Carlo</b> arithmetic, but in general, just rounding up or down with equal probability is more often used. Repeated runs will give a random distribution of results which can indicate how stable the computation is.|$|E

25|$|Quantum <b>Monte</b> <b>Carlo,</b> {{and more}} {{specifically}} Diffusion <b>Monte</b> <b>Carlo</b> methods can also {{be interpreted as a}} mean field particle <b>Monte</b> <b>Carlo</b> approximation of Feynman-Kac path integrals. The origins of Quantum <b>Monte</b> <b>Carlo</b> methods are often attributed to Enrico Fermi and Robert Richtmyer who developed in 1948 a mean field particle interpretation of neutron-chain reactions, but the first heuristic-like and genetic type particle algorithm (a.k.a. Resampled or Reconfiguration <b>Monte</b> <b>Carlo</b> methods) for estimating ground state energies of quantum systems (in reduced matrix models) is due to Jack H. Hetherington in 1984 In molecular chemistry, the use of genetic heuristic-like particle methodologies (a.k.a. pruning and enrichment strategies) {{can be traced back to}} 1955 with the seminal work of Marshall.

The data were accumulated using the D 0 detector during the 1994 - 1995 collider run of the Fermilab Tevatron at {radical}s = 1. 8 TeV. The data are compared to two parton shower <b>Monte</b> <b>Carlos</b> (HERWIG and PYTHIA) and an analytical prediction using the leading logarithmic BFKL resummation. The final state jets as predicted by the parton showering <b>Monte</b> <b>Carlos</b> describe the data over the entire pseudorapidity range studied.
