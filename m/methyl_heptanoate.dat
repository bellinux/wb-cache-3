40|$|Biomass-based {{energy sources}} are under {{intensive}} study for replacing fossil fuels with environmentally friendly alternatives. Bio-oils, {{intended for use}} as such or mixed with fossil fuels, need to be upgraded by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) due to the high oxygen-content of the molecules, which causes unwanted fuel properties. This thesis describes oxygen removal reactions of <b>methyl</b> <b>heptanoate</b> and phenol over sulphided NiMo/γ-Al 2 O 3 and CoMo/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. These two components were chosen as representative model reactants of the complex bio-oils. Reaction schemes for the HDO of <b>methyl</b> <b>heptanoate</b> and phenol are presented. Reaction steps were justified with acid-catalysed reactions (hydrolysis, dehydration, esterification), reductive reactions and decarbonylation. Reactivity of the reactants individually and as a mixture and their product distributions were explored with and without a sulphur additive as sulphur is {{needed to keep the}} catalyst in the sulphided form. Sulphur-containing components were formed during the HDO reactions even without sulphur addition during the experiments. The source of the sulphur is the sulphur species attached to the catalyst surface. Possible active sites are also discussed. Reduction reactions were proposed to occur on coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS), whereas acid-catalysed reactions and decarbonylation need sulphur-saturated sites. The vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of <b>methyl</b> <b>heptanoate</b> and solvent, in this case m-xylene, was measured to improve composition analysis of the multi-phase system. The Predictive Soave-Redlich-Kwong (PSRK) model was shown to be a good tool for simulation of the gas phase of a non-ideal system with polar components. The findings give new insights into the HDO reactions by describing the reaction pathways of two different types of model components and how the sulphur species affect those pathways. Moreover, the performance of the sulphided catalyst and simulation of a non-ideal system are presented...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{modeling}} of the oxidation of methyl esters was investigated {{and the specific}} chemistry, {{which is due to}} the presence of the ester group in this class of molecules, is described. New reactions and rate parameters were defined and included in the software EXGAS for the automatic generation of kinetic mechanisms. Models generated with EXGAS were successfully validated against data from the literature (oxidation of methyl hexanoate and <b>methyl</b> <b>heptanoate</b> in a jet-stirred reactor) and a new set of experimental results for methyl decanoate. The oxidation of this last species was investigated in a jet-stirred reactor at temperatures from 500 to 1100 K, including the negative temperature coefficient region, under stoichiometric conditions, at a pressure of 1. 06 bar and for a residence time of 1. 5 s: more than 30 reaction products, including olefins, unsaturated esters, and cyclic ethers, were quantified and successfully simulated. Flow rate analysis showed that reactions pathways for the oxidation of methyl esters in the low-temperature range are similar to that of alkanes...|$|E

The maximum amounts of short-chain FAME and of aldehydic FAME obtained were of the same order (3 - 4 mg/g sample in methyl linoleate and trilinolein heated for 15 h). After a second methylation step with diazomethane, amounts of dimethyl suberate and azelate were also quantitated. The total amounts of dimethyl esters in TAG model systems ranged from 1. 07 to 3. 35 mg/g of heated sample and were similar to those found for total aldehydic FAME (from 1. 03 to 3. 15 mg/g of heated sample), suggesting that oxidation of the aldehydic acyl group to an acid acyl group was a major reaction.

40|$|Biochemical changes {{occurring}} in developing green peas were studied {{in order to}} understand the textural and flavor changes. The activity of pectinmethylesterase (PME), a pectin modifying enzyme, was measured by the continuous spectrophotometric assay. Specific activity of PME decreased over all varieties and all sieve sizes as the seeds matured. Chelate soluble pectin contents were decreased or remained constant in all varieties. Decreased PME activity and pectin content indicated that the crosslinking of pectin and calcium might not play an important role in the firmness of green peas. The moisture level decreased as maturity increased, which was inversely related to an increase in protein and nonpectin carbohydrate polymers;Sensory analyses showed that all cultivars except one of the round seeded samples exhibited increased firmness as they matured. The pastiness attribute significantly increased in all cultivars. The seed coat toughness and green pea flavor changed in a less consistent fashion. The sweetest scores for all cultivars decreased throughout the study;For all cultivars, the most abundant volatile compounds were hexanal, n-nonane, <b>methyl</b> <b>heptanoate,</b> n-undecane, and propyl benzoate. Each cultivar exhibited a different pattern of changes in major volatile compounds. There was no single volatile which could be used to indicate harvestable maturity...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Hops (Humulus lupulus L.) are {{primarily}} {{used to provide}} specific characteristics to beer, such as bitterness, aroma, flavor, and microbial stability. The chemical composition of hops, relative to how they are used during the brewing process, dictates the expression of these characteristics. Of the raw ingredients that go into making beer, hops {{are perhaps the most}} costly. Considerable resources are required to grow quality hops, and therefore, brewers and hop growers alike have a common goal of obtaining the highest quality hops possible. However, quality can be a relative term. While it is commonly agreed upon that high brewing values, such as α-acids and essential oil content, and robust structural integrity are indicators of quality hops, there are many opinions of the ideal aroma. Changes in the chemical composition of hops during plant maturation are a dynamic process requiring a comprehensive, in-depth chemical and sensory analysis in order to maximize the characteristics of interest to brewers. The complex aroma chemistry associated with hops in beer has been a confounding variable for the practical brewer, and a deeper understanding of hop aroma development during cultivation is needed. The effect of harvest date, location, and cultivar on key chemical components of Willamette and Cascade hops was investigated for the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. Hops were harvested at 3 time points (Early, Typical, and Late), within a 3 -week interval from 2 different farms in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. A split-plot experimental design for each cultivar was used; each farm represented a main plot and harvest years were designated as subplots. American Society of Brewing Chemist standard methods of analysis were used to measure moisture content, hop acids and their homologs, Hop Storage Index, total essential oil content and volatile profile by GC-FID. Additionally, difference testing, descriptive analysis, and consumer acceptance testing was conducted using beers brewed with either Typical or Late harvested Cascade hops from the 2010 harvest year. The response of analytes was dependent on the cultivar being examined, its location within the Willamette Valley, as well as days until harvest. Hop acids did not change appreciably during plant maturation for the period examined, while hop oil content increased hyperbolically to a plateau as the hops aged on the bine. Increases in oil quantity were strongly correlated (r > 0. 90) with increases in α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, <b>methyl</b> <b>heptanoate,</b> and linalool concentrations. For Cascade, α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, ρ-cymene, caryophyllene, E, β-farnesene, and humulene all increased from Early to Typical points but no increase was observed between the Typical and Late time point. Linalool and <b>methyl</b> <b>heptanoate</b> increased between each time point while citral and humulene epoxide differed between Early harvest and Late harvest, but not between Early and Typical or Late and Typical harvests. For Willamette hops, α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, ρ-cymene, and linalool all increased between each time point. Caryophyllene, E β-farnesene, humulene, farnesol and citral all increased from Early harvest to Typical harvest but no difference was observed between Typical and Late. Clear sensory differences were found between beers brewed with Typical harvest Cascade hops and Late harvest Cascade hops, in terms of difference testing, descriptive analysis and consumer preference tests...|$|E
40|$|Co/MgO, Co/SiO 2 and Co/H beta {{catalysts}} {{were prepared}} by incipient wetness impregnation. The formation of MgO-CoO solid solution and MgCo 2 O 4 spinel in Co/MgO resulted in high dispersions of Co on MgO {{even at the}} low calcined temperatures and the high Co loadings. The second impregnation of Co on Co/MgO enhanced Co cations in surface/subsurface of catalysts, {{which led to the}} enlarged metallic Co particle sizes by H- 2 reduction. Comparatively, the highly dispersion of Co was only observed on SiO 2 and H beta at the low Co loadings owing to the Co delta+ species of strong interactions with these supports. The solid solution/spinel and the strongly interacted Co delta+ species induced the Co cations reduced at higher temperatures with obtaining the small Co particle sizes. These cases also significantly decreased the basicities of Co/MgO depending on calcined temperature and Co loadings, and increased the acidic sites of Co/SiO 2 and Co/H beta with obtaining enhanced acidities, respectively. During hydrogenolysis processing, the basic sites of Co/MgO triggers the splitting of acyl C-O bond of <b>methyl</b> <b>heptanoate</b> to form heptanal and methanol, followed by further hydrogenation of heptanal to 1 -heptanol. While the acidic Co/SiO 2 and Co/H beta induce the cracking of ether C-O bond to heptanoic acid and CH 4. Heptanoic acid intermediate is then converted into C- 6 and C- 7 alkanes by the parallel decarbonylation and HDO pathways, respectively. The activity and product distribution could be facilely mediated by the synergistic catalysis of metal and acid/base. Under optimal conditions, the maximal 1 -heptanol and summed C- 6 /C- 7 alkanes yields of 55 % and 89 % were observed over Co/MgO and Co/SiO 2 with desire Co loadings, respectively, indicating the promising applications of these catalysts in hydrogenolysis of vegetable oils.

40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of volatiles by 'Golden Delicious' apple fruits {{are highly}} diminshed {{after a long}} term controlled atmosphere (CA) or ultra low oxygen (ULO) storage. To study the mechanisms of volatile production at both harvest time and after long term storage and to explain {{the reasons for the}} inability of fruits to produce adequate amounts of volatiles, aroma precursors were supplied to the fruits at different times during storage. Fruits were supplied with the following aroma precursors: Alcohols (ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, isobutanol and isopentanol), acids (acetic-, propionic-, butyric-, pentanoic- and hexanoic acid) and esters (<b>methyl</b> <b>heptanoate</b> and methyl linolenate). Each aroma precursor was applied separately both at harvest time (October) and in March, after the apples were stored in ultra low oxygen conditions (1 % O 2 : 3 % CO 2) for 5 months. Alcohols, except ethanol, induced in both application times a strong increase in the biosynthesis of its volatiles. Butanol enhanced the production of butyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, butanol and pentyl butyrate. Hexanol enhanced the synthesis of butyl butyrate, hexyl acetate, hexyl propionate, hexanol and hexyl hexanoate. The biosynthesis of butyl butirate or propyl acetate by fruits stored for 5 months in ULO-storage after the treatments with hexanol or pentanol is evidence for an active beta-oxiodation process. The influence of acids was negligible at harvest time but they, except acetic and hexanioc acids, induced at the second date the biosynthesis of their esters. It is proposed that the long chain unsaturated fatty acids (linol- and linolenic acids) are the ultimate precursors for aroma (Bartley et al., 1985). The content of both fatty acids were found to be highly and positively correlated with volatile production. They decreased strongly after 6 months in ULO-storage in about the same manner as aroma production...|$|E
40|$|The acyl complex PdCl(COR) (PPh 3) 2 (R = Et, n-Hex), {{isolated}} {{during the}} course of hydrocarbalkoxylation reactions catalyzed by the precursor system PdCl 2 (PPh 3) 2 -PPh 3 (95 °C, P(CO) 100 – 120 atm; Pd: P = 1 : 3 - 4), in ethanol or higher alkanols as solvents, reacts with an alkanol R'OH in the presence of added PPh 3 (Pd: P = 1 : 3) to yield the ester RCOOR′and a mixture of PdCl 2 (PPh 2) 2 and Pd(PPh 3) 3 or 4. Moreover, when it is employed as catalyst precursor (R = n-Hex; Pd: P = 1 : 4) in the hydrocarbalkoxylation of ethylene, it is recovered as its ethyl analog and it yields almost stoichiometric amounts of n-HexCOOR′. When the di carbomethoxy complex PdCl(COOMe) (PPh 3) 2, isolated in mixture with PdCl(COR) (PPh 3) 2 in hydrocarbomethoxylation experiments, is treated with 1 -hexene in methanol (Pd:P: 1 -hexene:MeOH = 1 : 3 : 40 : 125), under nitrogen, in the absence of carbon monoxide, at 95 °C, <b>methyl</b> <b>heptanoate</b> ester is not formed, and the starting complex is recovered almost quantitatively (92 %). When PdCl 2 (PPh 3) 2 or PdCl(COOMe) (PPh 3) 2 are used as catalyst precursors for the carbonylation of 1 -hexene in MeOH, in the absence of added PPh 3 and in the presence of NEt 3 or of carboxylic acid anions (both of them are known to favor the formation of the carbomethoxy complex), no catalytic activity is observed and the precursors are recovered as palladium(0) carbonylphosphine complexes, ultimately mixed with the carbomethoxy complex. The results suppport the view that, of the two commonly accepted mechanisms for the catalytic hydrocarbalkoxylation of olefins, involving M-H or M-COOR′ addition to the olefinic double bond, only the first one, in which a key intermediate is a Pd-acyl species, is probably involved. When n-BuOH is isued as solvent the catalytic activity remains high even after 5 – 6 reuses of the catalyst, whereas in MeOH the activity falls significantly below its initial value because of decomposition of the catalyst into inactive palladium(0) complexes and palladium metal, probably via a carbomethoxypalladium complex...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Numerous {{investigations}} {{have been made}} on the contribution of butter cultures to the flavor of cultured cream butter, but production of uniform cultured cream butter has not been possible in industry. Therefore, it was desirable to investigate in detail the qualitative and quantitative chemistry of the flavor of high quality butter cultures, and to examine more closely some of the aspects of flavor production by butter culture organisms. Volatile flavor components of high quality butter culture and control heated milk were isolated from intact samples {{by means of a}} specially designed low-temperature, reduced-pressure steam distillation apparatus. Most of the flavor compounds present in the resulting distillate fractions were tentatively identified by gas chromatographic relative retention time data. Flavor concentrates obtained by ethyl ether extractions of aqueous distillates were also separated by temperature-programmed, capillary column gas chromatography, and the effluent from the capillary column was analyzed by a fast- scan mass spectrometer. Many of the flavor compounds in the flavor concentrates were positively identified by correlation of mass spectral and gas chromatographic data. In addition, supporting evidence for the identification of some flavor components was obtained through the use of qualitative functional group reagents, derivatives and headspace gas chromatography. Compounds that were positively identified in butter culture include ethanol, acetone, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, acetaldehyde, diacetyl, ethyl acetate, dimethyl sulfide, butanone, 2 -butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, methane, methyl chloride, carbon dioxide and methanol; also included were 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, acetoin, formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, methyl hexanoate, ethyl hexanoate, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, methyl octanoate and ethyl octanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in butter culture include hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, n-butanal, n-butanol, 2 -hexanone, n-pentanal, n-pentanol, 2 -mercaptoethanol, n-butyl formate, n-butyl acetate, 2 -methylbutanal, 3 -methylbutanal, methylpropanal, <b>methyl</b> <b>heptanoate,</b> n-octanal, 2 -tridecanone, methyl benzoate, methyl nonanoate, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl decanoate, methyl dodecanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. Compounds that were positively identified in control heated milk include acetaldehyde, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, 2 -heptanone, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, ethyl octanoate and methyl decanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in control heated milk include dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methyl mercaptan, methyl acetate, acetone, methanol, butanone, butanal, n-butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -mercaptoethanol, 2 -furfuryl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, <b>methyl</b> <b>heptanoate,</b> 2 -tridecanone, ethyl decanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. The data indicated that the qualitative flavor composition of control heated milk and butter culture were very similar. Diacetyl, ethanol, 2 -butanol and acetic acid were noted to be consistently absent in the data for the control heated milk. Other compounds were not observed in the heated milk fractions, but were also absent from some of the culture fractions. This was attributed to their presence in low concentrations, chemical instability or inefficient recovery. A modified 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolone hydrazone spectrophotometric procedure was adapted for the determination of acetaldehyde produced in lactic starter cultures. The procedure was applied in conjunction with diacetyl measurements in studying single- and mixed-strain lactic cultures. The diacetyl to acetaldehyde ratio was found to be approximately 4 : 1 in desirably flavored mixed-strain butter cultures. When the ratio of the two compounds was lower than 3 : 1 a green flavor was observed. Acetaldehyde utilization at 21 °C by Leuconostoc citrovorum 91404 was very rapid in both acidified (pH 4. 5) and non-acidified (pH 6. 5) milk cultures. The addition of five p. p. m. of acetaldehyde to non-acidified milk media prior to inoculation greatly enhanced growth of L. citrovorum 91404 during incubation at 21 °C. Combinations of single-strain organisms demonstrated that the green flavor defect can result from excess numbers of Streptococcus lactis or Streptococcus diacetilactis in relation to the L. citrovorum population. Diacetyl, dimethyl sulfide, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and carbon dioxide were found to be "key" compounds in natural butter culture flavor. Optimum levels of these compounds in butter culture were ascertained by chemical or flavor panel evaluations. On the basis of these determinations, a synthetic butter culture prepared with heated whole milk and delta-gluconolactone (final pH 4. 65) was flavored with 2. 0 p. p. m. of diacetyl, 0. 5 p. p. m. of acetaldehyde, 1250 p. p. m. of acetic acid, 25. 0 p. p. b. of dimethyl sulfide and a small amount of sodium bicarbonate for production of carbon dioxide. The resulting synthetic butter culture exhibited the typical aroma, flavor and body characteristics found in natural high quality butter cultures, except that the delta-gluconolactone was found to contribute an astringent flavor...|$|E
