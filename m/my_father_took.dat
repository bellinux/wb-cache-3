6000|$|... "Ah," [...] I answered, [...] "I {{come to that}} quickly. Mr. Temple is my cousin. After I {{left your}} uncle's house <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> me to Charlestown." ...|$|E
60|$|Sometime {{during this}} winter Wendell Phillips {{came to town}} and lectured on The Lost Arts. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> us all {{to see and hear}} this orator hero of his boyhood days in Boston.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They've been {{carrying}} on this game,' thought Jonas {{in a brown}} study, 'for {{the last two or}} three weeks. I never saw <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>take</b> so much notice of him as he has in that time. What! You're legacy hunting, are you, Mister Chuff? Eh?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If she be happy, I should honour the man {{who made}} her so. At least, I might be of use to you. I should see after poor Madison. I have sent him to the buccaneers indeed! Good-bye! I cannot rest till I see how <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>takes</b> it!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>my</b> <b>Father,</b> Herr von Katte's {{execution}} being ended, {{hastened to}} the Crown-Prince; he finds him miserably ill (SEHR ALTERIRT); advises {{him to take}} a cooling-powder in water, both which materials were ready on the table. This he presses on him: but the Prince always shakes his head." [...] Suspects poison, you think? [...] "Hereupon <b>my</b> <b>Father</b> <b>takes</b> from his pocket a paper, in which he carried cooling-powder for his own use; shakes out a portion of it into his hand, and so into his mouth; and now the Crown-Prince grips at <b>my</b> <b>Father's</b> powder, and <b>takes</b> that." [...] Privately to be made away with; death resolved upon in some way! thinks the desperate young man? [Nicolai, Anekdoten, vi. 183-189.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sir, please, sir, {{what was}} up? Who was it, sir? Sir, {{was it a}} burglar, sir? Have you ever met a burglar, sir? <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> me to see Raffles in the holidays, sir. Do you think this chap was like Raffles, sir? Sir--' ...|$|E
60|$|A silence followed. My father {{turned to}} Falcone, {{and held out}} his hand. Falcone sprang to give him a heavy iron gauntlet. Holding this by the fingers, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> a step towards Cosimo, and he was smiling, very calm again after his late furious mood.|$|E
6000|$|... "Emlyn, I {{know these}} parchments. They {{are those that}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> {{with him when he}} rode for London to {{disprove}} the Abbot's claim, and with them the evidence of the traitorous words he spoke last year at Shefton. Yes, this inner wrapping is my own; I took it from the store of worn linen in the passage-cupboard. But how come they here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{that was}} the way Theodora came by the news. I wish he had let alone telling her,--I could have managed her alone;--but there! it was not in human nature not to tell such a story, and it did not much matter how it was done. Well, and my aunt is furious, I suppose, but I'll take care of her and of my lady. I only want to know how <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>takes</b> it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "1. The first {{event of}} which I was {{conscious}} was {{the appearance of}} <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> He <b>took</b> me silently by the hand; and we found ourselves in the cabin of a ship.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My father, incited by poor Gregorio. Oh, Annaple! don't let any one guess till we {{know how}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> will <b>take</b> it. What is it, Ellen?' as the nursery-maid {{appeared}} on the stairs.|$|R
6000|$|Eliz. What? Thou too, friend? Dost thou {{not know}} me better? Wouldst have me leave undone what I begin? [To Count Pama] <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> the cross, sir: so did I: As {{he would die}} at his post, so will I die: He is a warrior: ask him, should I leave This my safe fort, and well-proved vantage-ground, To roam on this world's flat and fenceless steppes? ...|$|E
6000|$|Presently <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> out of {{his breast}} pocket an {{imposing}} [...] "Warranty Deed," [...] and fixed his eyes upon it and dropped into meditation. I knew what it was. A Texan lady and gentleman had given my half-brother, Orrin Johnson, a handsome property in a town in the North, in gratitude to him for having saved their lives {{by an act of}} brilliant heroism.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Barker bit her lip. Her {{companion}} {{had been}} recognized. She rose {{with a slight}} flirt of her skirt. [...] "I suppose I must go and get a room; there was nobody in the office when I came. Everything is badly managed here since <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> away the best servants to Hymettus." [...] She moved with affected carelessness towards the door, when Mrs. Horncastle, without rising from her seat, said:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was not the}} dinner, but the man," [...] said Norman. [...] "It is {{incomprehensible to}} me how <b>my</b> <b>father</b> could <b>take</b> to him. I'd as soon have Harvey Anderson for a friend!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{should not}} even have known that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> had <b>taken</b> a second wife but for some friend (or enemy)--I never {{discovered}} the person--who sent me a newspaper containing an announcement of the marriage.|$|R
60|$|And {{she must}} have talked, for there came a kind of feeling over everyone, as well as ourselves, that {{something}} was hanging over us, of which the issue would be known when <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> illness <b>took</b> some turn.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] he remarked, [...] "that I used to {{read the}} {{newspapers}} and wonder why on earth <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> such pains to try and frighten everybody. But he is altogether changed now. He even avoids the subject, although I am quite {{sure that it is}} his one engrossing thought. It is certain that no one has ever given such time and concentrated energy to it before. If only his work was the work of a sane man I could understand it being very valuable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{my father}} went away the king promised to pay him a visit on board of his ship next day, which he did, sure enough; and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> care to {{let it be known}} that he was coming, so there was no lack of the {{principal}} people thereabouts. They had all come down together, by the merest chance, to the place where the ship lay, just to enjoy the fresh air--being fresher there that day than at most other places on the fiord, no doubt! ...|$|E
6000|$|Far away dim {{clumps of}} trees showed, but no chimney was in sight, and no living thing moved save our own cattle and the hawks lazily {{wheeling}} in the air. My heart filled with awe {{as well as}} wonder. The majesty of this primeval world exalted me. I felt {{for the first time}} the poetry of the unplowed spaces. It seemed that the [...] "herds of deer and buffalo" [...] of our song might, at any moment, present themselves,--but they did not, and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> no account even of the marsh fowl.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{was coming}} to ask,' said David, 'if thou wouldst not own thyself to <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> and <b>take</b> thy proper place ere ganging farther south. It irks me {{to see some of}} the best blood in Scotland among the grooms.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only, mother, sweet mother," [...] {{cried the}} girl, childlike, set upon her pleasure, [...] "I {{will be as}} good as can be. I will transgress in nought if only thou wilt get <b>my</b> <b>father</b> to <b>take</b> me to see Master Eyre's cavern." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay,' said I, 'I {{feared it}} came by wreck, and that's by death; yet when <b>my</b> <b>father</b> died, I <b>took</b> his goods without remorse.' ...|$|R
6000|$|PTOLEMY (hastily). Yes: I {{remember}} {{the rest of}} it. (He resumes his monotone). Therefore the gods sent a stranger, one Mark Antony, a Roman captain of horsemen, across the sands of the desert and he set my father again upon the throne. And <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> Berenice my sister and struck her head off. And now that my father is dead yet another of his daughters, my sister Cleopatra, would snatch the kingdom from me and reign in my place. But the gods would not suffer (Pothinus coughs admonitorily)--the gods--the gods would not suffer-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't wish to alarm you, Miss Bygrave," [...] {{were the}} first words of Noel Vanstone's which caught Mrs. Lecount's attention, [...] "but {{there is only one}} safe house in Aldborough, and that house is mine. The sea may destroy all the other houses--it can't destroy Mine. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> care of that; my father was a {{remarkable}} man. He had My house built on piles. I have reason to believe they are the strongest piles in England. Nothing can possibly knock them down--I don't care what the sea does--nothing can possibly knock them down." ...|$|E
60|$|Then, one by one, they swore allegiance, till all had sworn. And, having sworn, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> {{me by the}} hand; he led me in solemn {{procession}} {{into each}} of the seven Sanctuaries that are in this Temple of Ra-Men-Ma, and in each I made offerings, swung incense, and officiated as priest. Clad in the Royal robes I made offerings in the Shrine of Horus, in the Shrine of Isis, in the Shrine of Osiris, in the Shrine of Amen-Ra, in the Shrine of Horemku, in the Shrine of Ptah, till at length I reached the Shrine of the King's Chamber.|$|E
6000|$|Then Medeia, {{the dark}} witch-maiden, laid a cruel and a cunning plot; for she killed Absyrtus her young brother, and cast {{him into the}} sea, and said, ‘Ere <b>my</b> <b>father</b> can <b>take</b> up his corpse and bury it, he must wait long, and be left far behind.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have promised}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> to <b>take</b> them,' said Tancred, 'though I feel they will only embarrass me. They have engaged {{to be ready}} at a week's notice; I shall write to them immediately. If they do not fulfil their engagement, I am absolved from mine.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] said I, [...] "I {{feared it}} came by wreck, and that's by death; yet when <b>my</b> <b>father</b> died I <b>took</b> his goods without remorse." ...|$|R
6000|$|The offer {{contained}} in your letter, which I received this [...] morning, may {{possibly have been}} kindly meant, but I wish [...] {{you to know that}} I consider it an insult. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> [...] his life after an interview with you, during which I [...] understand that you rejected a business proposition of his [...] in terms which I cannot help suspecting, from your attitude [...] while I was present, were unnecessarily brutal. Under those [...] circumstances, you can scarcely wonder that I, his [...] daughter, feel the greatest resentment at your offer and [...] decline without the slightest hesitation your proposal of [...] friendship.|$|E
60|$|My {{father never}} went a-hunting, an {{exercise}} he was exceeding fond of, {{but he would}} have me with him; and it pleased him when he found me like the sport. I lived thus, in all the pleasures 'twas possible for me to enjoy, for about a year more, when going out one morning with my father to hunt a stag, and having had a very hard chase, and gotten a great way off from home, we had leisure enough to ride gently back; and as we returned <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> occasion to enter into a serious discourse with me concerning the manner of my settling in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should {{certainly}} {{think that he}} would know it, sir. The bedroom was the same that my grandfather used to sleep in, and probably during the years before we came here young Bastow would have often been over the house. The first year or two after we came he was often up here with his father, but I know that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>took</b> such an objection to him, his manner and language were so offensive, that he would not have me, boy as I was--I was only about eleven when he came here--associate with him in the smallest degree. But during those two years he may very well have noticed where the ladder was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And," [...] said Grace, with a {{heightened}} color, and her liquid eyes shining, [...] "is there still nothing else?" [...] And while I {{glanced at her}} in a bewildered fashion she continued, [...] "Do you, like <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> consent for granted? Well, I will give it to you. Ralph, while you are living, and after, if you must go a little before I do, I will never look with favor upon any man. Meantime, sweetheart--for, as he said, I will not resist <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> will, save only in one matter--you must work and I must wait, trusting in what the future may bring. And so--you must leave me now; {{and it may be}} long before I see you. Go, and God bless you, taking my promise with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sure you}} must have done reading your letter by this time, Mat. I've been thinking, old fellow, of the talk we used to have, {{about going back to}} America together, and trying a little buffalo hunting and roaming about in the wilds. If <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>takes</b> me into favor again, and can be got to say Yes, I should so like to go with you, Mat. Not for too long, you know, because of my mother, and my friends over here. But a sea voyage, and a little {{scouring}} about in what you call the lonesome places, would do me such good! I don't feel as if I should ever settle properly to anything, till I've had my fling. I wonder whether <b>my</b> <b>father</b> would let me go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, will I," [...] Jean answered, then {{burst into}} tears. [...] "Mr. Dishart,"' she cried, [...] "if they <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> they'd best <b>take</b> <b>my</b> mither too." ...|$|R
