The original capital of the Company was £250,000, consisting of 250K shares of £1. G & L was primarily concerned with the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>funds,</b> but soon branched out into general private client portfolio management. The Company later became a Licensed Dealer in Securities, and was registered as a member of FIMBRA. The mid-1970s, saw Sir Godfrey taking 'early retirement', to pursue country interests.

Congress established an Indian <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> account reconciliation requirement in the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1987 in response to tribal concerns that (1) Interior had not consistently provided them with statements on their account balances, (2) their <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> accounts had never been reconciled, and (3) Interior planned to contract with a third party for <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> accounts. There are many obstacles that will complicate Interior's ability to document the amount and source of funds deposited to, managed in, and disbursed from their IIM accounts.
