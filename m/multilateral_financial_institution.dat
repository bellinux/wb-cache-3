40|$|This paper {{explores the}} case of a {{sovereign}} indebted country facing a choice of economic policy today that will determine the country’s ability to continue its debt servicing in the future. If the sovereign undertakes an unsound eco-nomic policy it will repudiate its debt with certainty; otherwise it will repudiate its debt with some positive probability. In our framework there is no court to enforce contracts. However, we assume the existence of a <b>multilateral</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> that could bailout the financially troubled sovereign country. Our focus is on the incentives created by the perspective of a bailout, as well as the punishment that the international financial markets could impose on the de-faulting country, on today’s economic policy. This essay provides a theoretical grounding for the IMF and other multilateral agencies intervention on the in-ternational financial markets showing that, unlike the idea that bailouts create both debtor and creditor moral hazard, it is sometimes a result of creditors’ overreaction to the prospect of a liquidity crisis. The main result of the essay is that the multilateral will be better off bailing out the country regardless of the economic policy undertaken in order to avoid bigger losses from a generalized financial crisis. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{opportunity}} for a powerful donor country, such as the United States, to use a <b>multilateral</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> (MFI) strategically {{in order to promote}} its own foreign policy goals has received little attention. The gain to a donor that is able to make the World Bank or other MFIs adapt to this donor’s view on an issue can be substantial. In that case, all the contributions from the other member nations will also stand behind the MFI’s stance on the particular is sue, and recipients may feel compelled to comply with this massive counterpart. As a result, influencing MFIs may give much more leverage to a donor’s foreign assistance in the foreign policy arena than pursuing the same goals bilaterally with the same amo unt of aid. We present a model where a donor tries to influence a MFI to put pressure on a recipient to comply with the foreign policy interests of the donor. This game-theoretic multi-agent model with one donor, two MFIs and one recipient illustrates the virtue of using the multilateral as an instrument in foreign policy as seen from the powerful donor’s point of view. Similarly, we show how this strategic behavior is damaging for the recipient in particular and for development in general...|$|E

The Andean region has been particularly successful in developing <b>multilateral</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions,</b> and development financing has been broader in scope than monetary cooperation. The two most successful institutions, the Andean Development Corporation (CAF) and the Latin American Reserve Fund (FLAR), have shown the capacity to provide services to member countries in a timely way, with countercyclical effects and on a large scale relative to other forms of multilateral financing. The strong sense of ownership of these organizations by member states, preferred creditor status, and professional management is reflected in very healthy portfolios, even in the face of default by member countries. The services of these institutions could be broadened to support, among others, the development and integration of the physical infrastructure and macroeconomic policy coordination. development banks, <b>financial</b> cooperation, <b>multilateral</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions,</b> reserve funds, South America,...|$|R

30|$|Literature {{reviews and}} local {{interviews}} indicate that Cambodia currently relies solely on ex post sources to finance recovery and reconstruction. Budget diversion and <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Institution</b> (MFI) borrowing {{are the major}} sources of funds given the country’s limited ability to raise taxes and to access domestic and international credit {{in the case of}} a disaster. Though domestic bonds have been issued to a limited extent in Cambodia (for example, USD 4 million was issued in the early 2000 s) (IMF 2012), this is largely regarded as an unviable option for resource mobilization in the immediate future. For budget diversion, the Cambodian government has a limited amount of unallocated funds in the budget that can be used ex post to fund unforeseen needs. As specified in Articles 22 – 25 of the country’s law on public finance (NGO Forum on Cambodia 2008), Cambodia’s current expenditure is divided into: (1) real expenditures; and (2) expenditures by order and unexpected expenditures. Unexpected expenditures “cover any expense whose allocation cannot be accurately specified when credit is approved” (NGO Forum on Cambodia 2008, p. 8). The uses of this unexpected expenditure include nondisaster purposes such as election expenditures and interest payments; to what extent unallocated budget resources can be used for recovery and reconstruction purposes remains unknown. For external borrowing, there is an upper limit of USD 617 million (400 million special drawing rights, SDR), as agreed with the International Monetary Fund (JICA 2011).|$|E

Individual agricultural commodities show {{even more pronounced}} increases: corn, wheat, rice and soybeans rose by 190, 162, 318 and 246 percent, respectively. Since July, {{food commodities}} prices began to fall. While this decline comes as a relief, prices are likely to stay high in the foreseeable future. Available {{evidence suggests that the}} decline in living standards of net consumers caused by higher food prices outweighs the benefits accruing to poor net sellers in the majority of countries that have been analyzed so far. The time to implement measures to help the poor net consumers cope with higher food prices is now. However, too many developing countries lack the instruments, administrative capacity and fiscal space to implement safety nets fast enough and in the required scale.
