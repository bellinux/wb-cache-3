50|$|The {{third and}} most famous Bowburn Colliery was sunk in 1906 by Bell Bros. Ltd., using the 1840 shaft as the {{ventilation}} upcast shaft (and, later, for <b>manriding).</b> Its first coal was drawn in 1908. It merged with Tursdale colliery in 1931 and grew {{to be one}} of the largest in the Durham coalfield, working six seams and with over 2,500 employees in the 1950s. Meanwhile the village was growing around it. Hardly anything now remains of the colliery complex which closed in July 1967. The colliery yard is now the site of the Bowburn South Industrial Estate.|$|E
50|$|This {{underground}} {{construction is}} part of a larger medieval silver mine in the Schauinsland mountain near Freiburg in Breisgau, sign of the last war efforts toextract zinc and lead ore from this area.Today the large mining complex is a repository for historical documents, adventure mine to attracttourists, students and amateur geologists as well as further underground research.The planned extension to the northern ore dressing part was not completed i.e. 300m remains unaccomplished. Therefore, the Deep Tunnel never could fulfill its function as transporting way.So it only served for the <b>manriding</b> of Kappel's miners and the mine's water drainage.|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of trains used at {{high speeds}} for transporting men along mine railways is examined using a number of mathematical models. These models predict the responses of different rail vehicles to typical irregularities in the track, and are {{used to examine the}} guidance, the ride, and the likelihood of derailment of the main classes of <b>manriding</b> trains used in British coal mines. The outcome of the modelling compares favourably with the results of tests carried out on actual vehicles. The investigation has shown that the safe speed at which trains may operate is ultimately restricted by the condition of the track, but changes {{in the design of the}} vehicles can lead to an improved performance. The use of conventional wheelsets, for example, can reduce flange wear significantly and so allows higher speeds to be reached. Guidelines for the design of vehicles intended for high speed use are included in this thesis...|$|E
