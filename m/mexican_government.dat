5|$|Due to its erratic motion, the <b>Mexican</b> <b>government</b> {{issued a}} Tropical Storm Warning and a Hurricane Watch early in Larry's {{lifetime}} from Veracruz to Campeche. The watches and warnings were extended westward to Tuxpan on the 4th and extended eastward to Ciudad del Carmen on October 5. Due {{to the threat}} of the storm, officials closed three Pemex oil ports. The company used its reserves to make sure profits weren't disrupted. In addition, the storm closed shipping ports in Dos Bocas in Tabasco, Coatzacoalcos in Veracruz, and Cayo Arcas in Campeche. The <b>Mexican</b> <b>government</b> placed six coastal states on maximum alert, while authorities set up 75 evacuation shelters for around 1,500people. Because of the storm, the government declared much of eastern Mexico a state of emergency.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm, the <b>Mexican</b> <b>government</b> sent food, water, {{and housing}} {{supplies}} to affected families in Oaxaca. Less {{than a week}} after Olaf moved through southern Mexico, Hurricane Pauline struck the same region with much stronger winds. Pauline caused heavier rainfall and more damage, killing at least 250 people. Some regions received 10 days of heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, Marty was {{threatening}} enough to prompt the <b>Mexican</b> <b>government</b> {{to issue a}} tropical storm watch from Manzanillo to Acapulco.

5|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>government</b> {{declared}} {{the region in}} Nayarit near the landfall of Kenna as a disaster area, allowing for the usage of emergency funds. Immediately {{after the passage of}} the hurricane, the Mexican Red Cross prepared 180technical staff and volunteers from seven states to deliver 125MT of food, medicine, and clothes to the areas most affected. The <b>Mexican</b> <b>government</b> deployed the Mexican Army to the area to remove fallen trees and establish water treatment plants to assist the affected population. The Mexican Navy was sent to assist to support medical personnel in the San Blas area, and the government Department for Family Development assisted the Mexican Red Cross in delivering food. Grupo Modelo, brewers of Corona beer, sent 6,600gallons (25,000liters) of drinking water and 1000food sets for the San Blas area.|$|E

5|$|The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances (adopted in 1971) {{requires}} {{its members}} to prohibit psilocybin, and parties to the treaty are required to restrict use of the drug to medical and scientific research under strictly controlled conditions. However, the mushrooms containing the drug were not specifically included in the convention, due largely to pressure from the <b>Mexican</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|Upon {{learning}} of the strong Mexican resistance to his proposed modifications, Webster instructed Letcher to negotiate the most favorable terms to which the Mexicans would agree. On January 25, 1851, Letcher signed a second treaty that was slightly more favorable to the Americans. During the time it had taken both sides to negotiate the treaty, however, public sentiment in Mexico had turned decidedly against any form of treaty with the United States regarding Tehuantepec. On May 22, 1851, the <b>Mexican</b> <b>government</b> declared the agreement with the American investors null on grounds that the provisional government which granted {{it did not have}} the right to do so. Letcher attempted to negotiate a new treaty to re-acquire the rights nullified by the <b>Mexican</b> <b>government,</b> but by February 14, 1852, he reported that he did not expect to be able to reach any kind of agreement. He returned home in August 1852.|$|E
5|$|When Mexico won its {{independence}} from Spain in 1821, the United States did not contest the new republic's claims to Texas, and both presidents John Quincy Adams (1825–1829) and Andrew Jackson (1829–1837) persistently sought, through official and unofficial channels, to procure all or portions of provincial Texas from the <b>Mexican</b> <b>government,</b> without success.|$|E

5|$|After the Taft-Díaz summit, Burnham led {{a team of}} 500 men in {{guarding}} mining properties {{owned by}} Hammond, J. P. Morgan, and the Guggenheims in the Mexican state of Sonora. Just as the irrigation and mining projects were nearing completion in 1912, {{a long series of}} Mexican revolutions began. The final blow to these efforts came in 1917 when Mexico passed laws prohibiting the sale of land to foreigners. Burnham and Hammond carried their properties until 1930 and then sold them to the <b>Mexican</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the Huerta-led <b>Mexican</b> <b>government</b> closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access {{coupled with the}} fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return in late April to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, Tampico {{was left}} without power or communications. About 15,000people became {{homeless}} {{due to the}} storm, or previously from Hurricane Gladys. The governor of Tamaulipas {{declared a state of}} emergency and requested assistance from the military to provide food and shelter. Within a day after the storm, water access was restored, although the city initially remained without power or telephone. Communications were cut to Tampico, except for the airport at the radio. The rail line from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City was cut during the storm, but was restored ten days later. Due to ongoing flood conditions, there was an outbreak of dysentery that killed two children. The <b>Mexican</b> <b>government</b> flew medical supplies, food, and clothing from Mexico City to Tampico, while four United States helicopters assisted in rescue missions along the Pánuco River. About 10days after Hilda struck Tampico, Hurricane Janet affected the same area, causing further damage and deaths. Collectively, the two hurricanes caused 1,240deaths along their paths, and damage from the consecutive storms totaled about half of Mexico's 1955 national budget. After the two hurricanes, the <b>Mexican</b> <b>government</b> and military worked to assist the affected residents, and the Mexican Red Cross provided vaccinations and medical assistance to prevent the spread of disease.|$|E

5|$|During the 1830s, the <b>Mexican</b> <b>government</b> wavered between federalist and centralist policies. As the {{pendulum}} swung sharply towards centralism in 1835, several Mexican states revolted. In June, {{a small group}} of settlers in Texas used the political unrest as an excuse to rebel against customs duties, in an incident known as the Anahuac Disturbances. The federal government responded by sending more troops to Texas.|$|E
5|$|Following a coup in the <b>Mexican</b> <b>government,</b> Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna became {{president}} and revoked many freedoms previously {{enjoyed by the}} Texans further deteriorating the government's relations with the region's settlers. Texas declared its independence and revolted in 1835. Following a number of battles with the Mexican army, the Texas army, {{under the leadership of}} General Sam Houston, finally defeated Santa Anna in the Battle of San Jacinto, near modern Pasadena.|$|E
5|$|Following the Mexican War of Independence, the {{missions}} were secularized {{and the land}} taken by the <b>Mexican</b> <b>government.</b> In 1834, Lieutenant Antonio del Valle was assigned to inventory the property of Mission San Fernando. The rancho {{was supposed to be}} returned to the Tataviam, but Governor Alvarado deeded it to his friend Del Valle instead on January 22, 1839. The Del Valle family moved into the former estancia buildings (near what is now Castaic).|$|E

5|$|Following {{the passage}} of the hurricane, {{reinforcement}} workers quickly repaired the communication network, and other workers distributed aid to victims in Sonora. The <b>Mexican</b> <b>government</b> allocated about $ (1995USD, $ 1995 MXN, $ USD) in funds for the restoration of houses and the overall infrastructure. Officials distributed 4,800 sheets, 500 cushions, and 1,500 blankets to hurricane victims. All sunken ships and drowned bodies were ultimately recovered by divers.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Delores' approach, the <b>Mexican</b> <b>government</b> issued {{a tropical storm}} warning and a hurricane watch from Ixtapa to Manzanillo on June 24. The watch and the warning were dropped the next day. The cyclone remained far away enough that no reports of high winds were received. Satellite observations indicated that heavy rains fell in affected areas from June 23 to 26. However, no damages or casualties were reported.|$|E
