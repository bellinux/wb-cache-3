5|$|The {{disastrous}} {{effects of}} the Smoot–Hawley tariff proved difficult for Herbert Hoover's 1932 re-election campaign. Franklin D. Roosevelt became the 32nd U.S. president and the Democratic Party worked to reverse trade protectionism in favor of trade liberalization. As an alternative to cutting tariffs across all imports, Democrats advocated for trade reciprocity. The U.S. Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934, aimed at restoring global trade and reducing unemployment. The legislation expressly authorized President Roosevelt to negotiate bilateral trade agreements and reduce tariffs considerably. If a country agreed to cut tariffs on certain commodities, the U.S. would institute corresponding cuts to promote trade between the two nations. Between 1934 and 1947, the U.S. negotiated 29 such agreements and the average tariff rate decreased by approximately one third during this same period. The legislation contained an important <b>most-favored-nation</b> <b>clause,</b> through which tariffs were equalized to all countries, such that trade agreements would not result in preferential or discriminatory tariff rates with certain countries on any particular import, due to the difficulties and inefficiencies associated with differential tariff rates. The clause effectively generalized tariff reductions from bilateral trade agreements, ultimately reducing worldwide tariff rates.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{remarkable}} consensus among scholars of international relations that bilateral cooperation is easier to achieve than multilateral cooperation. This essay proposes a formal model to show that this is incorrect, because a multilateral agreement may achieve what an equivalent series of bilateral agreements cannot. The author explores formally several different enforcement mechanisms, suggesting that the argument is robust. Throughout the essay, the author uses examples from the Marshall Plan to illustrate the logic of this result. The argument has implications for other substantive topics, such as <b>most-favored-nation</b> <b>clauses</b> in trade agreements, the theory of hegemonic stability, analysis of the European Economic Community, the politics of linkage, {{and the study of}} multilateralist norms...|$|R
40|$|The agency {{model is}} a {{business}} format used by online digital platform providers (such as Apple and Google) in which retail pricing decisions are delegated to upstream content providers subject to a fixed revenue-sharing rule. In a non-cooperative setting with competition both upstream and downstream, we show that the agency model can lead to higher or lower retail prices depending on the firms' revenue-sharing splits and the relative substitution between goods and between platforms. Even if industry-wide adoption of the agency model would lead to higher profits for all firms, there may be equilibria {{in which it is}} not universally adopted. <b>Most-favored-nation</b> <b>clauses</b> (used by Apple in the controversial e-books case) can be used in such settings to increase retail prices and induce adoption...|$|R
40|$|Using new, survivorship-bias free data, {{we examine}} the {{persistence}} in performance of 6, 260 institutional portfolios managed by 1, 475 investment managers between 1991 and 2004. Persistence in domestic equity portfolios is significant and economically large up to one year after portfolio formation. Unlike retail mutual funds, this persistence is entirely in winner portfolios. Similar patterns are evident in international equity portfolios, but persistence in fixed income portfolios lasts up to three years. Better performing portfolios {{are more likely to}} offer incentive fees and <b>most-favored-nation</b> <b>clauses</b> but also charge higher fees. Fee size is insufficient to eliminate excess returns. Top performers draw an influx of assets from plan sponsors, and in the year following such inflows, alphas sharply decline. Overall, the results are consistent with the supply-side quantity-based equilibrating process modeled by Berk and Green (2004) ...|$|R
40|$|Although a {{punishment}} {{can be applied}} only once, the threat to punish can be repeated several times. This is possible because when parties comply, the punishment is not applied and can thus be used to support a new threat. We refer to this feature of sticks as the "multiplication effect. " The same is not possible with promises to reward since carrots are used up every time a party complies; hence, at each round a new reward is needed. We show that the multiplication effect of sticks has pervasive consequences in economics and law and provides a unified explanation for seemingly unrelated phenomena such as comparative negligence, legal aid, the dynamics of riots and revolutions, the use of property rules, the commons problem, and the <b>most-favored-nation</b> <b>clause</b> in settlement negotiations.

40|$|This paper {{advances}} a {{model of}} multilateral trade negotiations to analyze {{the effects of the}} <b>most-favored-nation</b> <b>clause</b> (MFN) on international trade agreements. Negotiations are modeled in a three player, non-cooperative, dynamic bargaining framework that admits the possibility of both bilateral and multilateral agreements. The central result is that bargaining in the presence of MFN results in Pareto efficient, mutually advantageous, multilateral trade agreements. The free-rider problem commonly attributed to the presence of MFN does not arise, and, under a condition of symmetry, each country receives equal gains (or reciprocity) from the agreement. In the absence of MFN, many of these properties may not hold. Examples are given in which at most two of the three countries benefit from agreement. These results suggest that many of the criticisms levied against the MFN clause are misplaced; moreover, attempts to replace unconditional MFN with conditional MFN may sacrifice many of the long-held values of the GATT.

40|$|The International Law Commission {{held its}} sixty-fifth session in Geneva from May 6 to June 7 and from July 8 to August 9, 2013. The Commission devoted {{most of the}} sixty-fifth session to {{discussing}} three topics: immunity of state officials from foreign criminal jurisdiction; subsequent agreements and subsequent practice {{in relation to the}} interpretation of treaties; and protection of persons in the event of disasters. Notably, the Commission adopted three draft articles and commentary identifying three senior governmental officials as entitled to immunity ratione personae from foreign criminal jurisdiction – heads of state, heads of government, and foreign ministers – for their public or private acts, an immunity that ceases once they leave office. Work also continued on four other topics already on the Commission’s current program of work (identification of customary international law, provisional application of treaties, the obligation to extradite or prosecute, and the <b>most-favored-nation</b> <b>clause),</b> while new topics on protection of the environment in relation to armed conflicts and on protection of the atmosphere were added to the program. At the prior (sixty-fourth) session, the Commission had adopted thirty-two draft articles, together with commentaries, on the topic of expulsion of aliens, and is awaiting the comments and observations of governments on those draft articles to be submitted by 2014. Therefore, that topic was not addressed at the sixty-fifth session...|$|E
40|$|Textbook {{accounts}} of the Anglo-French trade agreement of 1860 argue that it heralded {{the beginning of a}} liberal trading order. This alleged success holds much interest from a modern policy point of view, for it rested on bilateral negotiations and <b>most-favored-nation</b> <b>clauses.</b> With the help of new data on international trade (the RICardo database), the authors provide empirical evidence and find that the treaty and subsequent network of MFN trade agreements coincided with the end of a period of unilateral liberalization across the world. They also find that it did not contribute to expanding trade at all. This is contrary to a deeply rooted belief among economists, economic historians, and political scientists. The authors draw a number of policy lessons that run counter to the conventional wisdom and raise skepticism toward the ability of bilateralism and MFN arrangements to promote trade liberalization...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{recognized}} by economists that long-term contracting under {{an array of}} price and non-price provisions may be an efficient response to small-numbers bargaining problems. Empirical work to distinguish such issues from predictions of models of market power and bargaining has been sparse, principally because the necessary data on individual transactions are seldom publicly available. The U. S. natural gas industry is well suited for such tests both {{because of the small}} number of buyers (pipelines) and sellers (producers) in each market and the large capital commitments required of transacting parties at the inning of the contract. We present a model of the bilateral bargaining process is natural gas field markets under uncertainty. We identify the 'initial price' as the outcome of the bargaining aver a fixed payment for pipeline to producer, and describe "price-escalator provisions" as a means of making the contract responsive at the margin to changes in the valuation of gas over the term of the agreement. Our econometric work rakes use of a large, detailed data set on during the l 950 s. Empirical evidence from models of price determination and the use of <b>most-favored-nation</b> <b>clauses</b> is supportive of the theoretical model. ...|$|R
40|$|Most-favored-nation" (hereafter, MFN) clauses {{have been}} used in {{analyses}} of international trade, durable goods monopoly pricing, and franchise contracting to address a repeat player's time-inconsistency problem. Recent work by Spier (forthcoming and 2002) has extended this perspective to the settlements of litigation by (for example) one defendant with a collection of plaintiffs. We examine a different motivation for the use of MFNs in settlement bargaining. We argue that a non-repeat player can use an MFN to extend her reach into subsequent bargaining games. That is, an early-bargaining plaintiff can use an MFN to modify the subsequent bargaining game between the defendant and a later-bargaining plaintiff in a manner that improves the early plaintiff's payoff. Moreover, we will identify two routes through which this improvement is achieved. The obvious route is that, if the MFN is triggered by the later settlement, the early plaintiff receives an additional payment. The less obvious route is that the early plaintiff's incentives for information-revelation can be enhanced by the potential for a future payment, so that the defendant can resort to trial on a less-frequent basis. Using a signaling model, we find that the repeat player (the defendant) is indifferent about the MFN, while the later plaintiff is always worse off when an MFN constrains her settlement bargaining with the defendant. Although MFNs can never provide a Pareto improvement in this model, we demonstrate that plausible circumstances exist under which total surplus is increased by an MFN.

40|$|Very {{preliminary}} This paper {{conducts a}} cross-country {{analysis of the}} free rider problem associated with the <b>Most-Favored-Nation</b> (MFN) <b>clause</b> in the WTO. We develop a model that relates MFN free riding {{to the degree of}} concentration of the exporters and market power of the importers of any product. Specifically, the model predicts that the level of the importer’s tariff resulting from negotiations should be negatively related to the product of exporter concentration, as measured by a Herfindahl-Hirschman index (sum of squared export shares), and the importer’s market power, as measured by the inverse elasticity of export supply, on a product-by-product basis. We test this hypothesis using data on tariffs, trade and production in 81 sectors across 35 WTO countries and find strong support...|$|R
40|$|Many {{settlement}} {{contracts in}} lawsuits that involve either multiple plaintiffs or multiple defendants include so-called <b>most-favored-nation</b> (MFN) <b>clauses.</b> If a defendant who faces multiple claims, for example, settles with some plaintiffs early and settles with additional plaintiffs later {{for a greater}} amount, then the early settlers will receive the more favorable terms as well. This paper presents two frameworks for evaluating the private and social desirability of MFN clauses. First, MFN clauses can mitigate asymmetric-information problems and encourage cases to settle earlier. While avoiding delayed settlement is privately and socially desirable, it is shown that the litigation rate may rise. Second, MFN clauses {{may be used as}} a bargaining tool for extracting value from future plaintiffs, leading to breakdowns in future negotiations. In both frameworks, the private incentives to use MFN clauses may diverge from the interests of society as a whole. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{multilateral}} trade system {{rests on}} the principle of non-discrimination. The <b>most-favored-nation</b> (MFN) <b>clause</b> embodied in Article I of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was the defining principle for a system that emerged in the post-World War II era largely in reaction to the folly of protectionism and managed trade that contributed to the global economic depression of the 1930 s. From its origins, however, the GATT allowed for exemptions from the MFN rule in the case of reciprocal preferential trade agreements. It also permits granting unilateral (non-reciprocal) preferences to developing countries. Unilateral preferences granted by OECD countries create an inevitable tension between “more preferred ” developing countries – typically beneficiaries from pre-existing colonial regimes – and other developing countries with respect to the effects of MFN liberalization by preference-granting countries. Concerns about preference erosion have become one of the key points of debate in the negotiations surrounding the Doha Development Agenda. Similar concerns have arisen in the past. In the 1970 s, for example, the impact of Tokyo Round-related liberalization on the benefits derived b...|$|R
40|$|Nondiscrimination is the {{cornerstone}} of the multilateral trade system. Asexpressed in the <b>most-favored-nation</b> (MFN) <b>clause</b> embodied in Article Iof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), it was the defining principle of the trading system that emerged in the post–World War II era—largely as a reaction to the folly of protectionism and preferential trading arrangements that had contributed to the global economic depression of the 1930 s. However, GATT allowed for exemptions to the MFN rule: reciprocal preferential agreements and unilateral preferences granted to developing countries. 1 The rationale for grants of preferential access to the markets of industrialized countries emerged from arguments in favor of special and differential treatment (SDT) for developing countries under GATT. The underlying justification for SDT, in turn, reflected development thinking in the early 1960 s, notably the theory of import-substitution industrialization. That theory was premised on the argument that developing countries needed to foster industrial capacity both to reduce import dependence and to diversify away from traditional commodities that were subject to declining terms of trade over the long term (and often also affected by short-term price volatility). The practical expression of that argument was the policy of erectin...|$|R
