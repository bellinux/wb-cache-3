40|$|Inhaled prostanoids and {{phosphodiesterase}} (PDE) inhibitors {{have been}} suggested for treatment of severe pulmonary hypertension. In catheterized rabbits with acute pulmonary hypertension induced by continuous infusion of the stable thromboxane analogue U 46619, we asked whether sildenafil (PDE 1 / 5 / 6 inhibitor), <b>motapizone</b> (PDE 3 inhibitor) or 8 -Methoxymethyl-IBMX (PDE 1 inhibitor) synergize with inhaled iloprost. Inhalation of iloprost caused a transient pulmonary artery pressure decline, levelling off within < 20 min, without significant changes in blood gases or systemic hemodynamics. Infusion of 8 -Methoxymethyl-IBMX, <b>motapizone</b> and sildenafil caused each a dose-dependent decrease in pulmonary artery pressure, with sildenafil possessing the highest efficacy {{and at the same}} time selectivity for the pulmonary circulation. When combining a per se ineffective dose of each PDE inhibitor (200 μg/kg × min 8 -Methoxymethyl-IBMX, 1 μg/kg × min sildenafil, 5 μg/kg × min <b>motapizone)</b> with subsequent iloprost nebulization, marked amplification of the prostanoid induced pulmonary vasodilatory response was noted and the area under the curve of PPA reduction was nearly threefold increased with all approaches, as compared to sole iloprost administration. Further amplification was achieved with the combination of inhaled iloprost with sildenafil plus <b>motapizone,</b> but not with sildenafil plus 8 MM-IBMX. Systemic hemodynamics and gas exchange were not altered for all combinations. We conclude that co-administration of minute systemic doses of selective PDE inhibitors with inhaled iloprost markedly enhances and prolongs the pulmonary vasodilatory response to inhaled iloprost, with maintenance of pulmonary selectivity and ventilation perfusion matching. The prominent effect of sildenafil may be operative via both PDE 1 and PDE 5, and is further enhanced by co-application of a PDE 3 inhibitor...|$|E

40|$|Non-selective inhibitors of cyclic {{nucleotide}} phosphodiesterase (PDE) block allergen-induced {{contraction of}} passively sensitized human airways in vitro by a dual mechanism involving a direct relaxant effect on smooth muscle and inhibition of histamine and cysteinyl leukotriene (LT) release from airways. We investigated {{the effects of}} non-selective PDE inhibitors and selective inhibitors of PDE 3 and PDE 4 {{in order to determine}} the involvement of PDE isoenzymes in the suppression of allergic bronchoconstriction. Macroscopically normal airways from 76 patients were sensitized with IgE-rich sera (> 250 [*]u[*]ml− 1) containing specific antibodies against allergen (Dermatophagoides farinae). Contractile responses of bronchial rings were assessed using standard organ bath techniques. Passive sensitization caused increased contractile responses to allergen, histamine and LTC 4. Non-selective PDE inhibitors (theophylline, 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine [IBMX]), a PDE 3 -selective inhibitor (<b>motapizone),</b> PDE 4 -selective inhibitors (RP 73401, rolipram, AWD 12 - 281) and a mixed PDE 3 / 4 inhibitor (zardaverine) all significantly relaxed inherent bronchial tone at resting tension and to a similar degree. Theophylline, IBMX, zardaverine and the combination of <b>motapizone</b> and RP 73401 inhibited the contractile responses to allergen and LTC 4. Pre-treatment with <b>motapizone,</b> RP 73401, rolipram or the methylxanthine adenosine receptor antagonist, 8 -phenyltheophylline, did not significantly decrease responses to either allergen or LTC 4. We conclude that combined inhibition of PDE 3 and PDE 4, but not selective inhibition of either isoenzyme or antagonism of adenosine receptors, is effective in suppressing allergen-induced contractions of passively sensitized human airways. The relationship between allergen- and LTC 4 -induced responses suggests that PDE inhibitors with PDE 3 and PDE 4 selectivity are likely to act in part through inhibition of mediator release and not simply through direct relaxant actions on airway smooth muscle...|$|E

Recently, phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors have received much in-terest because {{they not only}} are bronchodilators but also can suppress release of proinflammatory mediators. In the present study, we investigated the effect of three different PDE inhibitors on TX release and BC in LPS-exposed per-fused rat lungs. The PDE inhibitors used were <b>motapizone</b> (PDE III specific), rolipram (PDE IV specific), and zardaverine (mixed PDE III and IV specific). At 5 mM, a concentration at which all three compounds selectively block their respective PDE isoenzyme, rolipram (IC 50 5 0. 04 mM) and zardaverine (IC 50 5 1. 8 mM) largely attenuated the LPS-induced BC...|$|E
40|$|During {{in vitro}} culture in 10 % human AB serum, human {{peripheral}} blood monocytes acquire a macrophage-like phenotype. The underlying differentiation {{was characterized by}} increased activities of the macrophage marker enzymes unspecific esterase (NaF-insensitive form) and acid phosphatase, {{as well as by}} a down-regulation in surface CD 14 expression. In parallel, a dramatic change in the phosphodiesterase (PDE) profile became evident within a few days that strongly resembled that previously described for human alveolar macrophages. Whereas PDE 1 and PDE 3 activities were augmented, PDE 4 activity, which represented the major cyclic AMP-hydrolysing activity of peripheral blood monocytes, rapidly declined. Monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages responded to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with the release of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF). In line with the change in CD 14 expression, the EC 50 value of LPS for induction of TNF release increased from approximately 0. 1 [*]ng[*]ml− 1 in peripheral blood monocytes to about 2 [*]ng[*]ml− 1 in macrophages. Both populations of cells were equally susceptible towards inhibition of TNF release by cyclic AMP elevating agents such as dibutyryl cyclic AMP, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) or forskolin, which all led to a complete abrogation of TNF production in a concentration-dependent manner and which were more efficient than the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. In monocytes, PDE 4 selective inhibitors (rolipram, RP 73401) suppressed TNF formation by 80 %, whereas <b>motapizone,</b> a PDE 3 selective compound, exerted a comparatively weak effect (10 – 15 % inhibition). Combined use of PDE 3 plus PDE 4 inhibitors resulted in an additive effect and fully abrogated LPS-induced TNF release as did the mixed PDE 3 / 4 inhibitor tolafentrine. In monocyte-derived macrophages, neither PDE 3 - nor PDE 4 -selective drugs markedly affected TNF generation when used alone (< 15 % inhibition), whereas in combination, they led to a maximal inhibition of TNF formation by about 40 – 50 %. However, in the presence of PGE 2 (10 [*]nM), <b>motapizone</b> and rolipram or RP 73401 were equally effective and blocked TNF release by 40 %. Tolafentrine or <b>motapizone</b> in the presence of either PDE 4 inhibitor, completely abrogated TNF formation in the presence of PGE 2. Thus, an additional cyclic AMP trigger is necessary for PDE inhibitors to become effective in macrophages. Finally, the putative regulatory role for PDE 1 in the regulation of TNF production in macrophages was investigated. Zaprinast, at a concentration showing 80 % inhibition of PDE 1 activity (100 [*]μmol[*]l− 1), did not influence TNF release. At higher concentrations (1 [*]mmol[*]l− 1), zaprinast became effective, but this inhibition of TNF release can be attributed to a significant inhibitory action of this drug on PDE 3 and PDE 4 isoenzymes. In summary, the in vitro differentiation of human peripheral blood monocytes to macrophages is characterized by a profound change in the PDE isoenzyme pattern. The change in the PDE 4 to PDE 3 ratio is functionally reflected by an altered susceptibility towards selective PDE inhibitors under appropriate stimulating conditions...|$|E
40|$|Neutrophil-derived {{hydrogen}} peroxide (H 2 O 2) {{is believed to}} play an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular injury and pulmonary edema. H 2 O 2 time- and dose-dependently increased the hydraulic conductivity and decreased the selectivity of an endothelial cell monolayer derived from porcine pulmonary arteries. Effects of H 2 O 2 on endothelial permeability were completely inhibited by adenylate cyclase activation with 10 (- 12) M cholera toxin or 0. 1 microM forskolin. 10 (- 8) M Sp-cAMPS, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A agonist, was similarly effective. The phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors <b>motapizone</b> (10 (- 4) M), rolipram (10 (- 6) M), and zardaverine (10 (- 8) M), which specifically inhibit PDE-isoenzymes III, IV, and III/IV potently blocked H 2 O 2 -induced endothelial permeability when combined with 10 (- 6) M prostaglandin E 1. Overall cellular cAMP content and inhibition of H 2 O 2 effects on endothelial permeability were poorly correlated. H 2 O 2 exposure resulted in a rapid and substantial decrease in endothelial cAMP content. The analysis of the PDE isoenzyme spectrum showed high activities of isoenzymes II, III, and IV in porcine pulmonary endothelial cells. The data suggest that adenylate cyclase activation/PDE inhibition is a powerful approach to block H 2 O 2 -induced increase in endothelial permeability. This concept appears especially valuable when endothelial PDE isoenzyme pattern and PDE inhibitor profile are matched optimally...|$|E
40|$|We studied whether {{selective}} inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide hydrolysing phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes influence IL- 1 β-induced {{nitric oxide}} (NO) release from human articular chondrocytes. In addition, {{the pattern of}} PDE isoenzymes contributing to cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis in human chondrocytes was characterized. Chondrocytes were isolated from human osteoarthritic cartilage and cultured in alginate beads. IL- 1 β-induced chondrocyte products (nitric oxide and prostaglandin E 2) were measured in culture supernatants after 48 [*]h incubation time. PDE activities were assessed in chondrocyte lysates. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and PDE 4 A-D proteins were detected by immunoblotting. The selective PDE 4 inhibitors Piclamilast and Roflumilast partially attenuated IL- 1 β-induced NO production whereas selective inhibitors of PDE 2 (EHNA), PDE 3 (<b>Motapizone)</b> or PDE 5 (Sildenafil) were inactive. Indomethacin reversed the reduction of IL- 1 β-induced NO by PDE 4 inhibitors. It was shown that autocrine prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) enabled PDE 4 inhibitors to reduce IL- 1 β-induced NO in this experimental setting. Major PDE 4 and PDE 1 activities were identified in chondrocyte lysates whereas only minor activities of PDE 2, 3 and 5 were found. IL- 1 β and cyclic AMP-mimetics upregulated PDE 4 activity and this was associated with an augmentation of PDE 4 B 2 protein. Based on the view that nitric oxide contributes to cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis our study suggests that PDE 4 inhibitors may have chondroprotective effects...|$|E
40|$|PDE 4 {{belongs to}} the PDE 1 - 11 superfamily, {{specifically}} degrades cAMP and is present in almost all cells {{with the exception of}} platelets. Selective inhibition of PDE 4 augments cellular cAMP content that improves chronic inflammation or tissue remodeling. Consequently, over almost three decades industry endeavored to develop PDE 4 inhibitors. Roflumilast has now been approved in EU/US as the first PDE 4 inhibitor for treatment in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In COPD an enhanced burden of oxidative stress is likely promoting key disease mechanisms such as COPD-related inflammation, lung remodeling or mucociliary malfunction. Neutrophils, which are considered as primary effectors cells in COPD almost exclusively express PDE 4. That PDE 4 inhibitors such as rolipram or Ro 20 - 1724 suppress fMLP-induced superoxide radical release from neutrophils was described in 1990. These findings were probably the first demonstration that PDE 4 inhibitors may mitigate oxidative stress. Such initial observations in neutrophils were now extended to numerous other cells involved in COPD, specifically structural cells. Indeed, PDE 4 inhibitors reduce ROS formation in airway epithelial cells, lung fibroblasts, endothelial cells or pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Mechanistically, PDE 4 inhibitors may act by (i) reducing NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity secondary to inactivating Rac, (ii) attenuating the expression levels of some NOX isoforms. Cellular ROS levels may result from the balance between ROS formation mainly attributed to the NOX system and ROS quenching secondary to the Nrf 2 -dependent anti-oxidative machinery. Aside from its potential to reduce ROS formation more recently an increase in cAMP was related to enhanced Nrf 2 nuclear accumulation, which may support the anti-oxidative machinery. Evidence for this concept was first generated in dermal fibroblasts. Preliminary data from human umbilical vein endothelial cells showed that inhibition of PDE 4 (1 µM roflumilast N-oxide) when PDE 3 was blocked (10 µM <b>motapizone)</b> resulted in an about 1. 9 -fold increase in nuclear Nrf 2 following a 3 hours incubation time (roflumilast N-oxide or <b>motapizone</b> on their own were ineffective). Thus, the notion may be raised that PDE 4 inhibitors potentially attack excessive ROS twofold, by inhibiting generation and accelerating degradation. More studies are required to further support such a concept. Lung fibrotic remodeling has been related to oxidative stress and indeed N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) may have some clinical benefit in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In vivo, NAC partly suppresses the bleomycin-induced lung fibrotic response indicating a critical role of ROS to mediate fibrosis. The PDE 4 inhibitor roflumilast was shown to mitigate lung fibrosis following bleomycin in preventive but also therapeutic protocols in mice and rats that was paralleled by a partial reduction of lipid hydroperoxides (markers of oxidative stress) in BAL. Taken together, there is firm evidence that PDE 4 inhibitors suppress oxidative stress in vitro that is also reflected in vivo. One may postulate that reducing the burden of oxidative stress {{may be one of the}} mechanisms translating into the therapeutic success of roflumilast in severe COPD although this notion remains to be specifically addressed in clinical investigations...|$|E
40|$|CD 19 + B {{lymphocytes}} were purified {{from the}} peripheral blood of normal and atopic subjects to analyse {{and compare the}} phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity profile, PDE mRNA expression {{and the importance of}} PDE activity for the regulation of B cell function. The majority of cyclic AMP hydrolyzing activity of human B cells was cytosolic PDE 4, followed by cytosolic PDE 7 -like activity; marginal PDE 3 activity was found only in the particulate B cell fraction. PDE 1, PDE 2 and PDE 5 activities were not detected. By cDNA-PCR analysis mRNA of the PDE 4 subtypes A, B (splice variant PDE 4 B 2) and D were detected. In addition, a weak signal for PDE 3 A was found. No differences in PDE activities or mRNA expression of PDE subtypes were found in B cells from either normal or atopic subjects. Stimulation of B lymphocytes with the polyclonal stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced a proliferative response in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, which was increased in the presence of interleukin- 4 (IL- 4). PDE 4 inhibitors (rolipram, piclamilast) led to an increase in the cellular cyclic AMP concentration and to an augmentation of proliferation, whereas a PDE 3 inhibitor (<b>motapizone)</b> was ineffective, which is in accordance with the PDE profile found. The proliferation enhancing effect of the PDE 4 inhibitors was partly mimicked by the cyclic AMP analogues dibutyryl (db) cyclic AMP and 5, 6 -dichloro- 1 -β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole- 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Sp-isomer (dcl-cBIMPS), respectively. However, at concentrations exceeding 100 [*]μM db-cyclic AMP suppressed B lymphocyte proliferation, probably as a result of cytotoxicity. Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2, 1 [*]μM) and forskolin (10 [*]μM) did not affect B cell proliferation, even when given in combination with rolipram. Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) by differentially acting selective inhibitors (KT 5720, Rp- 8 -Br-cyclic AMPS) decreased the proliferative response of control cells and reversed the proliferation enhancing effects of rolipram. Importantly, PDE 4 activity in LPS/IL- 4 -activated B lymphocytes decreased by about 50 % compared to unstimulated control values. We conclude that an increase in cyclic AMP, mediated by down-regulation of PDE 4 activity, is involved in the stimulation of B cell proliferation in response to LPS/IL- 4. B cell proliferation in response to a mitogenic stimulus can be further enhanced by pharmacological elevation of cyclic AMP...|$|E
