So far no marker {{is known that}} reliably discriminates between muscularis propria (MP) and muscularis mucosae (MM) of the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, smoothelin expression {{has been shown to}} differ in <b>MP</b> and <b>MM</b> of the urinary bladder. We aimed to analyse the expression of smoothelin in the gastrointestinal tract in <b>MP</b> and <b>MM</b> in order to define a novel diagnostic tool to identify MM bundles. METHODS AND RESULTS: The expression of smoothelin was analysed immunohistochemically in comparison with alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) in specimens from colon, stomach and oesophagus (n = 107). In contrast to alpha-SMA, which equally stained <b>MM</b> and <b>MP,</b> absent or significantly weaker smoothelin expression was found in MM was found, which was particularly valid in colon and gastric specimens.

We used 2, 400 one-day old chicks that were distributed in a completely randomized design in a 4 x 4 factorial arrangement, and fed diets containing four types of phosphates: 1) dicalcium phosphate with granules smaller than 1 mm (DP); 2) monocalcium phosphate with up to 10 % of granules between 1 and 2 <b>mm</b> (<b>MP</b> 10 %); 3) monocalcium phosphate with 30 to 40 % of granules between 1 and 2 <b>mm</b> (<b>MP</b> 30 - 40 %); and, 4) granulated monocalcium phosphate with granules larger than 2 mm (GMP) and four levels (0. 30; 0. 36; 0. 42 and 0. 48 %) of available phosphorus, totaling 16 treatments with five replicates of 30 birds each. The available phosphorus requirements {{for each type of}} phosphates were estimated by polynomial regression models.

METHODS: We {{compared}} 28 -mm metal-on-polyethylene (MP) total hip arthroplasty with large femoral head metal-on-metal (MM) total hip arthroplasty in a randomised clinical trial. ROM one year postoperatively was determined in 50 patients. Mean head sizes were 28 <b>mm</b> (<b>MP)</b> and 48 mm (MM).

40|$|Methyl {{parathion}} (MP), {{a highly}} toxic organophosphorus pesticide, was widely used for agriculture crop protection. During {{the production of}} MP {{and the process of}} MP-containing wastewater treatment, MP can release into the atmosphere and will do great harm to adjacent communities. A consortium comprised of an engineered microorganism and a natural rho-nitrophenol (PNP) degrader was assembled for complete mineralization of MP. We genetically engineered Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3) enabling the overexpression of methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH). In addition, we isolated Ochrobactrum sp. strain LL- 1 that utilized PNP, a product of MP hydrolysis, as the sole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source. The coculture effectively hydrolyzed 0. 2 <b>mM</b> <b>MP</b> and prevented the accumulation of PNP in suspended culture. A laboratory-scale bioreactor containing the dual-species consortium was developed for the treatment of artificial off-gas containing MP. The bioreactor maintained over 98 % of average MP removal efficiency over a 75 day period, and PNP produced from hydrolysis of MP was degraded completely, indicating that complete mineralization of MP was achieved. The strategy of linking degrading consortium to a bioreactor may provide an alternative to physicochemical abatement technologies for the treatment of waste-gas streams containing MP as well as other PNP-substituted organophosphates...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{mitochondria}} in stimulus-secretion coupling of pancreatic beta-cells {{was examined}} using methyl pyruvate (MP). MP stimulated insulin secretion {{in the absence}} of glucose, with maximal effect at 5 mM. K+ (30 mM) alone, or in combination with diazoxide (100 microM), failed to enhance MP-induced secretion. Diazoxide (100 microM) inhibited MP-induced insulin secretion. MP depolarized the beta-cell in a concentration-dependent manner (5 - 20 mM). The sustained depolarization induced by 20 <b>mM</b> <b>MP</b> was not influenced by 100 microM diazoxide, but the continuous spiking activity was suppressed by 500 microM diazoxide. Pyruvate failed to initiate insulin release (5 - 20 mM) or to depolarize the membrane potential. ATP production in isolated beta-cell mitochondria was detected as accumulation of ATP in the medium during incubation in the presence of malate or glutamate in combination with pyruvate or MP. There was no difference in ATP production induced by pyruvate/malate or MP/malate in isolated beta-cell mitochondria. ATP production by MP/glutamate was higher than that induced by pyruvate/glutamate, but it was much lower than that induced by alpha-ketoisocaproate/glutamate. Pyruvate (5 mM) or MP (5 mM) had no effect on the ATP/ADP ratio in whole islets, whereas glucose (20 mM) significantly increased the whole islet ATP/ADP ratio. It is concluded that MP-induced beta-cell membrane depolarization or insulin release does not relate directly to mitochondrial ATP production. Instead MP may exert a direct extramitochondrial effect, or it may stimulate beta-cell mitochondria to produce coupling factors different from ATP to initiate insulin release...|$|E

There is major {{concern over the}} nature of the tissue bridging graft elements and graft/recipient cartilage. Chondrocyte viability is thought to be an important determinant of the quality of repair. The aim of the current study was to compare the zone of death for osteochondral grafts harvested with the commercially available Acufex, and an osteotome with a specially designed cutting-edge. Materials/methodsThe circular osteotomes were the Acufex 4. 5 <b>mm</b> <b>MP</b> (Smith & Nephew) and the Lissimore, which has a different cutting-tip geometry and sharpness. These implements were used to harvest osteochondral plugs from macroscopically non-degenerate human lateral condyle explants obtained from the anterior femoral cuts of knee replacement surgery. Confocal laser scanning microscopy with vital staining was used to quantify the zone of marginal chondrocyte death for the entire perimeter of the plugs. ResultsThe increase in cartilage plug diameter (reference the osteotome minimal internal diameter) was significantly greater for the Acufex (Mann–Whitney; n= 5; P= 0. 0079), with the diameter (mm) increasing by 0. 49 ± 0. 03 (10. 9 %), compared with 0. 16 ± 0. 02 (3. 3 %) for the Lissimore. Osteochondral plugs had a significantly (Mann–Whitney; n= 5; P= 0. 0079) lower mean margin of cell death with the Lissimore osteotome (117. 8 ± 8. 97 μm) than the Acufex MP (315. 3 ± 5. 90 μm). ConclusionsCutting-tip profile {{is an important factor in}} determining the extent of marginal death in circular osteochondral grafts. We have designed and assessed an alternative cutting-tip, which caused significantly less marginal death than the commercially available Acufex. We conclude that there is scope for improvement of osteochondral harvest techniques...|$|E

Methods Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) of total and site-specific causes of death were calculated for 579 patients with MM (McKee-Farrar) and 1585 patients with MP (Brunswik, Lubinus) THA for primary osteoarthritis. Results Mean follow-up time was 17. 9 years for patients with MM and 16. 7 years for patients with MP. Overall SMR was 0. 95 for the MM cohort and 0. 90 for the MP cohort, {{as compared to the}} normal population. Both cohorts showed significantly decreased mortality for the first decade postoperatively, equal mortality over the next 10 years, and significantly increased mortality after 20 years.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of {{methylprednisolone}} (MP) on reperfusion injury in severe uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock and explore the possible mechanism involved. Methods: Twelve dogs were randomly divided into two groups, control group (Group I, n = 6) and MP group (Group II, n = 6). The animals were bled continuously from a femoral artery catheter to produce uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock models. Resuscitation with lactated Ringer's (LR) solution was initiated when mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased to 20 mm Hg, and MAP was maintained at 30 - 40 <b>mm</b> Hg. <b>MP</b> (4 mg/kg) was injected intravenously in Group II when resuscitation began. While in Group I, normal saline (NS) was injected instead. The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured before exsanguination (T 1), when MAP decreased to 20 mm Hg (T 2), 60 min (T 3) and 120 min (T 4) after resuscitation. Heart rate, MAP and cardiac output (CO) levels were recorded concomitantly. Results: Infusion volume and hemorrhage volume shed from the superior mesenteric artery in Group I were higher than those in Group II (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05). After reperfusion, blood SOD levels decreased progressively and MDA levels increased rapidly in Group I. In Group II, blood SOD levels at T 3 and T 4 decreased as compared with that at T 1 but a stepwise increase was present. At T 4, blood SOD level was significantly higher in Group II than in Group I (P < 0. 01). At T 3 and T 4, MDA levels were markedly lower in Group II than in Group I. During reperfusion, MAP was more steady in Group II than in Group I and survival rate after 120 min (at T 4) was higher in Group II than in Group I (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: MP has a protective effect on severe uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock and subsequent reperfusion injury.

40|$|This study {{compares the}} effects of machine {{perfusion}} (MP) at different temperatures with simple cold storage. In addition, the role of Ca(2 +) levels in the MP medium was evaluated. For MP, rat livers were perfused for 6 hours with Krebs-Henseleit (KH) solution (with 1. 25 or 2. 5 mM CaCl(2)) at 4 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, or 37 degrees C. For cold storage, livers were perfused in situ and preserved with Celsior solution at 4 degrees C for 6 hours. The reperfusion period (2 hours at 37 degrees C) was performed under the same conditions used for MP-preserved and cold storage-preserved livers. Hepatic enzyme release, bile production, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, and morphology were evaluated during MP and reperfusion. MP at 37 degrees C caused marked enzyme release; the same findings were obtained during reperfusion. By contrast, MP temperature lowering induced {{a significant decrease in}} liver damage. High levels of biliary gamma-glutamyltransferase and lactate dehydrogenase were found with MP at 4 degrees C and 10 degrees C but not with MP at 20 degrees C. When a KH- 1. 25 mM CaCl(2) solution was used during MP at 20 degrees C, very low enzyme release was observed and significantly lower hepatic damage was present {{at the end of the}} reperfusion period in comparison with cold storage.

The 48 Mp devices are formed by stitching 1 kx 1 k building blocks with 6. 0 µm pixel pitch in 6 x 8 (hxv) format. This concept allows us to design four large-area (48 Mp) and sixty-two basic (1 Mp) devices per 6 ” wafer. The basic image sensor is relatively small in order to obtain data from many devices. Evaluation of the basic parameters such as the image pixel and on-chip amplifier provides us statistical data using a limited number of wafers.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} design, fabrication, {{and test}} {{of an integrated}} micromachined ultrasound transducer (MUT). This MUT can work as an emitter and a receiver of ultrasonic signals in air and {{is intended to be}} used in applications requiring both acoustic signal generation and sensing. Among these applications there can be detection or distance measurements of different objects where the nature either of these objects or of their surroundings does not allow the use of light-based methods. The device has been fabricated in a 0. 8 mum CMOS process combined with deep reactive ion etching, integrating in the same chip a suspended membrane (plate) and the associated interface electronics. The plate is thermally actuated at its resonance frequency (40 kHz) during emission. During reception, a piezoresistive bridge placed on the membrane is used for monitoring its deflections. The main advantage of the design using an actuator and a sensor integrated in one multilayer structure is its simplicity. Comparing with capacitive transducers where two-electrode structure is used, considerations in terms of mechanical stability and membrane damping as well as the fabrication process are not critical. The integrated solution allows the use of an amplifier at the output of the piezoresistive Wheatstone bridge which results in the sensitivity of 35 mV/Pa; the maximum acoustic pressure generated by the transducer at 10 <b>mm</b> is 5 <b>mP...</b>|$|R
40|$|Adult Drosophila melanogaster locate food {{resources}} by using distinct olfactory cues that often {{are associated with}} the fermentation of fruit. However, in addition to being an odorous food source and providing a possible site for oviposition, fermenting fruit also provides a physical substrate upon which flies can attract and court a potential mate. In this study, we demonstrate that Drosophila adults are able to recruit additional flies to a food source by covering the exposed surface area with fecal spots, and that this recruitment is mediated via olfactory receptors (Ors). Analyses of the deposited frass material demonstrates that frass contains several previously studied pheromone components, such as methyl laurate (ML), methyl myristate (<b>MM),</b> methyl palmitate (<b>MP),</b> and 11 -cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), in addition to several cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) that are known to be behaviorally active. Moreover, this study also demonstrates that adult feeding is increased in the presence of frass, although it appears that Ors are less likely to mediate this phenomenon. In summary, the frass deposited by the fly onto the fruit provides both pheromone and CHC cues that lead to increased feeding and aggregation in Drosophila. This research {{is the first step in}} examining Drosophila frass as an important chemical signature that provides information about both the sex and the species of the fly that generated the fecal spots...|$|R

40|$|AIM: A {{pilot study}} was {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} accuracy of computed tomography (CT) staging in identifying patients with high-risk colon cancers who would be considered as candidates for a neoadjuvant therapy trial (FOxTROT) and those at low risk (T 1 /T 2) who would be excluded. METHOD: Participating radiologists from 19 centres attended workshops for standardization of image interpretation according to previously defined prognostic criteria: good prognosis tumours, including, T 1 /T 2; intermediate prognosis, T 3 < 5 mm tumour invasion beyond the muscularis propria (MP); and poor prognosis tumours, including T 3 with tumour extension ≥ 5 <b>mm</b> beyond the <b>MP</b> or T 4. The CT findings were compared with histopathology as the reference standard. RESULTS: Of 94 patients with radiological and pathological data, 71 % were categorized by CT as having a poor prognosis. The sensitivity and specificity of CT in identifying these tumours were 87 % (95 % CI, 74 - 94) and 49 % (95 % CI, 33 - 65). Sensitivity and specificity for tumour infiltration beyond the MP (T 3 /T 4 vs T 1 /T 2) were 95 % (95 % CI, 87 - 98) and 50 % (95 % CI, 22 - 77), respectively. Including all CT-staged T 3 and T 4 patients in the trial would have increased the proportion eligible for entry to 89 % (n = 84) without affecting the false-positive rate of 7 %. Some 20 % of T 3 /T 4 patients would have been ineligible for FOxTROT because of synchronous metastases. CONCLUSION: In a multicentre setting, CT scanning identified high-risk (T 3 / 4) colon cancers with minimal overstaging of T 1 /T 2 tumours, thus establishing the feasibility of radiologically guided neoadjuvant chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{goals of}} this study were to {{evaluate}} the ability of a nonlinear optimization tool to provide solutions for maintaining consistent qualities of diets irrespective of the plane of nutrition (L) and to evaluate the effect of the plane of nutrition on intake and digestibility of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), crude fat (CF), non fibrous carbohydrates (NFC), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and metabolizability (qm) of diets using sheep as a generalized experimental model. Eight wethers were randomly assigned to two balanced four-treatment Latin squares conducted simultaneously with four diets providing nutritional levels that were multiples of maintenance levels (ME=Mm; 1. 5 Mm; 2 Mm; and 2. 5 Mm, where ME is the metabolizable energy intake, and Mm is the metabolizable energy intake for maintenance). The ME, <b>Mm,</b> metabolizable protein (<b>MP)</b> and NDF of the diet were subjected to nonlinear constraints; the model was considered a general nonlinear programming problem and solved using Microsoft Excel Solver® with Newton's method of resolution. The intake of nutrients, digestible nutrients, digestible energy (DE) and the amounts of feces and urine produced daily were measured and analyzed statistically by fitting a linear mixed model. The corrected metabolizability (qm') and plane of nutrition (Lc) were obtained {{on the basis of the}} digestible, urinary, and simulated methane losses. The trends of some variables were reanalyzed by regressing observed values against Lc. All measured variables were affected by L. The intakes of DM and OM increased in an asymptotic fashion as Lc increased, whereas the intake of NDF increased linearly as Lc increased. At levels immediately below maintenance, observed values were approximately constant. Digestible amounts of OM, DE, CF, and CP consumed increased linearly at levels above maintenance, whereas the digestible amounts of total carbohydrates, neutral detergent solubles, and ashes increased in an asymptotic fashion. Under conditions of controlled feeding, the nonlinear optimization tool yielded dietary solutions with a nearly constant metabolizability in which the rate of increase in crude protein, digestible crude protein, and digestible energy intakes remained constant as the plane of nutrition increased...|$|R
40|$|Lysmata amboinensis is a protandric {{simultaneous}} hermaphrodite (PSH); individuals {{develop as}} males (MPs) and then change to simultaneous hermaphrodites (SHs). PSHs exhibit functions of {{both males and}} females during each reproductive cycle. There are a number of important physiological reproductive features that have not been previously studies in this species, including male size at sexual maturity, fecundity of SHs based on body size differences and timing of the sex phase change. To answer the former two questions, MPs were paired with SHs to produce various size combinations. It was found that L. amboinensis MPs were sexually mature at a total length (TL) of 34. 0 mm and larval production increased with increasing body length, with large SHs displaying 3 times the larval output of small and medium -sized SHs. To answer the latter question, MPs were exposed to different social situations by being paired with either another MP (of similar or larger size) or with an SH. Indeed, the timing of sex phase change was influenced by the social condition, indicating "environmental sex determination" (ESD). The "default" size at change was 37. 1 <b>mm</b> (TL) when <b>MPs</b> were reared alone; when MPs were paired with a larger MP it was the larger MP that changed first to SH, while the partner shrimp changed at a larger size than the "default". If MPs were paired with similar-sized MPs or with SHs, phase change occurred at a smaller size than the "default". The observed patterns are discussed in terms of reproductive opportunities for a species occuring in small groups in the wild, referred to as a "low density" spp. Aquaculture production of L. amboinensis has been problematic due to the prolonged duration of larval development, punctuated by periods of high mortality. Broodstock maturation diets have been shown to affect fecundity and offspring quality. The primary aim of this component {{of the study was to}} identify a suitable maturation diet for L. amboinensis from a range of commonly available feeds. The six diets were squid, mussel, adult Artemia, a commercial feed, and combinations of the aforementioned and were fed to L. amboinensis over four reproductive cycles. Broodstock fed the squid-mussel diet lost > ½ of the egg mass during incubation, with decreased larval production, the lowest being 22 larvae. By contrast, broodstock fed adult Artemia retained > 80...|$|R
