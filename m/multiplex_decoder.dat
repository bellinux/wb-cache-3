40|$|Abstract — A rapid {{prototyping}} {{system for the}} analysis of multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) algorithms is presented in this paper. It combines the flexibility of MATLAB with the processing power of existing field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to speed up the implementation and testing of real-time multiple-antenna receiver algorithms, suitable for integration into current wireless communication systems. As an application example, the sphere decoder (SD) for uncoded MIMO systems has been implemented and tested on this {{rapid prototyping}} system. Index Terms — Field-programmable gate array (FPGA), multiple input-multiple output (MIMO), rapid prototyping, spatial <b>multiplexing,</b> sphere <b>decoder,</b> wireless communications. I...|$|R
40|$|Error {{correcting}} coding {{is required}} for 50 Mbps data link from the Shuttle Orbiter through the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) to the ground because of severe power limitations. Convolutional coding has been chosen because the decoding algorithms (sequential and Viterbi) provide significant coding gains at the required bit error probability of one in 10 to the sixth power and can be implemented at 50 Mbps with moderate hardware. While a 50 Mbps sequential decoder has been built, the highest data rate achieved for a Viterbi decoder is 10 Mbps. Thus, five multiplexed 10 Mbps Viterbi decoders must be used to provide a 50 Mbps data rate. This paper discusses the tradeoffs which were considered when selecting the <b>multiplexed</b> Viterbi <b>decoder</b> approach for this application...|$|R

40|$|The MAX 7219 /MAX 7221 are compact, serial input/output common-cathode display drivers that {{interface}} microprocessors (µPs) to 7 -segment numeric LED {{displays of}} up to 8 digits, bar-graph displays, or 64 individual LEDs. Included on-chip are a BCD code-B <b>decoder,</b> <b>multiplex</b> scan circuitry, segment and digit drivers, and an 8 x 8 static RAM that stores each digit. Only one external resistor is required to set the segment current for all LEDs. The MAX 7221 is compatible with SPI™, QSPI™, and MICROWIRE™, and has slewrate-limited segment drivers to reduce EMI. A convenient 4 -wire serial interface connects to all common µPs. Individual digits may be addressed and updated without rewriting the entire display. The MAX 7219 /MAX 7221 also allow the user to select code-B decoding or no-decode for each digit. The devices include a 150 µA low-power shutdown mode, analog and digital brightness control, a scanlimit register that allows the user to display from 1 to 8 digits, and a test mode that forces all LEDs on. For applications requiring 3 V operation or segment blinking, refer to the MAX 6951 data sheet...|$|R
50|$|The Boeing-Eastman Kodak {{proposal}} was announced by NASA on 20 December 1963. The main bus of the Lunar Orbiter had the general {{shape of a}} truncated cone, 1.65 m tall and 1.5 m in diameter at the base. The spacecraft was composed of three decks supported by trusses and an arch. The equipment deck {{at the base of}} the craft held the battery, transponder, flight programmer, inertial reference unit (IRU), Canopus star tracker, command <b>decoder,</b> <b>multiplex</b> encoder, traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA), and the photographic system. Four solar panels were mounted to extend out from this deck with a total span across of 3.72 m. Also extending out from the base of the spacecraft were a high gain antenna on a 1.32 m boom and a low-gain antenna on a 2.08 m boom. Above the equipment deck, the middle deck held the velocity control engine, propellant, oxidizer and pressurization tanks, Sun sensors, and micro-meteoroid detectors. The third deck consisted of a heat shield to protect the spacecraft from the firing of the velocity control engine. The nozzle of the engine protruded through the center of the shield. Mounted on the perimeter of the top deck were four attitude control thrusters.|$|R
