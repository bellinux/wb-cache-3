40|$|International audienceMarine sponges are {{considered}} as a gold mine of new natural products possessing numerous biological activities. We examined the cytotoxic properties of the ethyl acetate extract (JDE) of the previously unrecorded sponge, Jaspis sp. collected from <b>Mauritius</b> <b>Waters.</b> JDE displayed an interesting IC 50 of 0. 057 ± 0. 04 μg/mL on HL- 60 cells evaluated by MTS assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential change, microscopic analysis and DNA fragmentation assays also confirmed JDE induced apoptosis on HL- 60 cells. Annexin V staining demonstrated that JDE induced apoptosis at different concentrations. Treatment with 100 ng/mL of JDE led to an accumulation of cells in G 2 /M phase after 24 h, causing a significant increase of cells (24 h: 5. 84 %; 48 h: 13. 41 %) in sub-G 1 phase suggesting that JDE can induce cell cycle arrest in G 2 /M phase...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the in vitro antibacterial and antioxidant activities of crude and fractionated extracts of the Plakortis nigra (P. nigra) sea sponge from <b>Mauritius</b> sea <b>waters.</b> Methods: Preliminary qualitative chemical {{screening of the}} sponge extracts was conducted by using standard methods while the total phenolic content (TPC) was estimated through the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Antibacterial activity was evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. The minimum inhibitory concentration {{was determined by the}} broth microdilution method. All sponge extracts were assessed for antioxidant activity via the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging in vitro model. Results: Alkaloids, phenols, steroids, terpenoids, tannins and saponins were detected in the sponge extracts and TPC varied from (2. 280 ± 0. 072) mg to (12. 790 ± 0. 236) mg gallic acid equivalents per gram extract (P< 0. 05). All the extracts inhibited the growth of at least two bacterial strains whilst the most potent in vitro antibacterial activities were observed in the most polar ethyl acetate and butanol fractions (minimum inhibitory concentration values 0. 103 – 0. 211 mg/mL) of P. nigra. Each extract scavenged 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl free radicals while the hexane fraction displayed the highest scavenging ability at (27. 50 ± 1. 85) ...|$|R
