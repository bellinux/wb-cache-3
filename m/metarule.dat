30|$|Partial {{transcription}} of {{the content}} of <adjective> to the new concept “<noun><adjective>” or “<adjective><noun>”. In this case, <adjective> is characterizing <noun> and some semantic relations of <adjective> must be transcribed to <noun> so as to give it characteristics or qualities. The following <b>metarule</b> is used in this step: <A>is characterized by <B>,<B> <rel_name> C/→ <A characterized by B> <rel_name> C To define which make this inference valid, each rel_name from the semantic base should be analyzed according {{to the nature of the}} semantic relationship. In general, structural semantic relations (e.g., isA, madeOf, partOf) usually should not be inherited because they express content restricted to <adjective>. For example, the fact that “<paixão><isA><feeling>” does not imply that “<crime passional><isA><feeling>”. Pragmatic semantic relationships as functional, causal, incidental or motivational relationships commonly give rise to characteristics that are attributed from <adjective> to <noun>. For example, the fact that “<paixão><effectOf><jealousy>” authorizes the generation {{of the content}} “<crime passional><effectOf><jeal- ousy>”. As an example, Table 3 shows the types of semantic relationships of InferenceNet defined for the application of the <b>metarule</b> above. However, other semantic knowledge bases can be used, simply by analyzing the nature of relations expressed and which ones can be inherited from <adjective> to “<noun><adjective>” or “<adjective><noun>”. At the end of the process, the heuristic returns the list of semantic relations generated, which were associated with “<noun><adjective>” or “<adjective><noun>”.|$|E

40|$|Proponents of {{generalized}} phrase structure grammar (GPSG) cite its weak context-free generative {{power as}} proof of the computational tractability of GPSG-Recognition. Since context-free languages (CFLs) can be parsed in time proportional to the cube of the sentence length, and GPSGs only generate CFLs, it seems plausible that GPSGs can also be parsed in cubic time. This longstanding, widely-assumed GPSG "efficient parsability" result is misleading: parsing the sentences of an arbitrary GPSG is likely to be intractable, because a reduction from 3 SAT proves that the universal recognition problem for the GPSGs of Gazdar (1981) is NP-hard. Crucially, the time to parse a sentence of a CFL can be the product of sentence length cubed and context-free grammar size squared, and the GPSG grammar can result in an exponentially large set of derived context-free rules. A central object in the 1981 GPSG theory, the <b>metarule,</b> inherently results in an intractable parsing problem, even when severely constrained.

40|$|This is {{a review}} of the new information-theoretic Process Physics. This new {{modelling}} of reality brings physics very much into accord with the general concepts of Process Phi-losophy. The fundamental assumption is that reality is to be modelled as self-organising semantic or relational information using a self-referentially limited neural network model, where the information-theoretic limitations are implemented via self-referential noise. This modelling was motivated by the discovery that such stochastic neural networks are foundational to known quantum field theories. In Process Physics time is a distinct non-geometric process while space and quantum physics are emergent and unified. Quantum phenomena are caused by fractal topological defects embedded in and forming a grow-ing three-dimensional fractal process-space, which is essentially a quantum foam. Other features are the emergence of quantum field theory with flavour and confined colour, limited causality and the Born quantum measurement <b>metarule,</b> inertia, time-dilation effects, gravity and the equivalence principle, a growing universe with a cosmological constant, black holes and event horizons, and the emergence of classicality.

40|$|ABSTRACT. It {{is argued}} that, {{in order to}} account for {{examples}} where the indexicals ‘now’ and ‘here ’ do not refer to the time and location of the utterance, {{we do not have}} to assume (pace Quentin Smith) that they have different characters (reference-fixing rules), governed by a single <b>metarule</b> or metacharacter. The traditional, the fixed character view is defended: ‘now ’ and ‘here ’ always refer to the time and location of the utterance. It is shown that when their referent does not correspond to the time and/or location of the utterance, ‘now’ and ‘here ’ work in an anaphoric way, inheriting their reference from another noun phrase. The latter may be explicit or implicit in the discourse. It is also shown that ‘now ’ and ‘here ’ can inherit their reference from a presupposed or tacit reference. In that case, they are coreferential with what will be labeled a ‘tacit initiator’. This anaphoric interpretation has the merit of fitting within the Kaplanian distinction between pure indexicals (‘now’, ‘here’, ‘today’, etc.) and demonstratives (‘this’, ‘that’, ‘she’, etc.). According to a widely accepted theory popularized by Kaplan (1977) and Perry (1977), indexicals (‘I’, ‘today’, ‘this’, ‘now’, etc.) are directly referential expressions. As such, they contribute the referent itself to wha...|$|E
