5|$|Several {{attempts}} at a Franco-Mongol alliance against the Islamic caliphates, their common enemy, {{were made by}} various leaders among the Frankish Crusaders and the Mongol Empire in the 13th century. Such an alliance <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> an obvious choice: the Mongols were already sympathetic to Christianity, given the presence of many influential Nestorian Christians in the Mongol court. The Franks (Western Europeans {{and those in the}} Crusader States of the Levant) were open to the idea of support from the East, in part owing to the long-running legend of the mythical Prester John, an Eastern king in a magical kingdom who many believed would one day come to the assistance of the Crusaders in the Holy Land. The Franks and Mongols also shared a common enemy in the Muslims. However, despite many messages, gifts, and emissaries {{over the course of several}} decades, the often-proposed alliance never came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Jesus sits in {{judgement}} in {{the upper}} centre panel. He holds a lily {{in his right hand}} and a sword in his left, and sits on a rainbow extending across two panels, while his feet rest on a sphere. His right hand is raised in the act of blessing, his left hand lowered. These positions indicate the act of judgement; he is deciding if souls are to be sent to Heaven or Hell, his gestures echoing the direction and positioning of the scales held by the Archangel Michael beneath him. His palms are open, revealing the wounds sustained when they were nailed to the cross, while his cope gapes in places making visible the injury caused by the lance, which pours deep-red blood. Christ's face is identical to the representation in van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, completed just a few years later in 1452. Christ, placed so high in the pictorial space and spanning both registers, orchestrates the entirety of the inner panels. Whereas earlier Last Judgements <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> chaotic, here Christ brings a sense of order.|$|E
25|$|Constantine had {{altogether}} more colourful plans. Having {{restored the}} unity of the Empire, and, being in the course of major governmental reforms as well as of sponsoring the consolidation of the Christian church, he was well aware that Rome was an unsatisfactory capital. Rome was too far from the frontiers, and hence from the armies and the imperial courts, and it offered an undesirable playground for disaffected politicians. Yet it had been the capital of the state for over a thousand years, and it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> unthinkable to suggest that the capital be moved to a different location. Nevertheless, Constantine identified the site of Byzantium as the right place: a place where an emperor could sit, readily defended, with easy access to the Danube or the Euphrates frontiers, his court supplied from the rich gardens and sophisticated workshops of Roman Asia, his treasuries filled by the wealthiest provinces of the Empire.|$|E

25|$|In United's next match, {{home cooking}} {{seemed to make}} all the difference, as the team won 3–2 on their return to RFK for United's first home match in 5 weeks. Playing at home in front of over 19,000 fans was {{probably}} a boost to the team, but an even bigger boost might have been the sight of the team's new striker tandem of Espindola and Saborio. The game started horribly for the home side as the Philadelphia Union scored in the first and fourth minute to take what <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> a commanding 2–0 lead. United began to claw their way back into the game as Saborio scored on his United debut, with a 37th minute volley of a Korb cross. The game was tied midway through the second half when Nick DeLeon finished a rebound of an Espindola shot. D.C. United finally went ahead on an Espindola header, with Chris Korb getting his second assist of the match. DeLeon's goal was his first in over a year in a regular season match.|$|E
500|$|The biographer Richard D. E. Burton {{comments}} that, in {{the late}} 1920s, Poulenc <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to be in an}} enviable position: professionally successful and independently well-off, having inherited a substantial fortune from his father. He bought a large country house, Le Grande Coteau, at Noizay, Indre-et-Loire, [...] south-west of Paris, where he retreated to compose in peaceful surroundings. Yet he was troubled, struggling {{to come to terms with}} his sexuality, which was predominantly homosexual. His first serious affair was with the painter Richard Chanlaire, to whom he sent a copy of the Concert champêtre score inscribed, [...] "You have changed my life, you are the sunshine of my thirty years, a reason for living and working". Nevertheless, while this affair was in progress Poulenc proposed marriage to his friend Raymonde Linossier. As she was not only well aware of his homosexuality but was also romantically attached elsewhere, she refused him, and their relationship became strained. He suffered the first of many periods of depression, which affected his ability to compose, and he was devastated in January 1930 when Linossier died suddenly at the age of 32. On her death he wrote, [...] "All my youth departs with her, all that part of my life that belonged only to her. I sob... I am now twenty years older". His affair with Chanlaire petered out in 1931, though they remained lifelong friends.|$|E
500|$|In his {{analysis}} of the Spaghetti Western genre, Alex Cox described The Great Silence as Corbucci's [...] "tightest, most relentless Western; his best and his bleakest. It's shot in his trademark messy, over-edited, jerky-zoom style, and its telephoto close-ups are frequently out of focus. Yet it is incredibly beautiful". He voiced praise for Ippoliti's strategy of [...] "shooting through things" [...] (a marked improvement over his work on Navajo Joe), the tight script, the strong female characters and the tragic nature of the ending, rooted in Corbucci's pessimism towards the deaths of radical political leaders. Performance-wise, he described Sheriff Burnett and Regina, the film's equivalent of the [...] "cute/funny" [...] characters that had appeared in Corbucci's earlier Westerns, as [...] "tolerable" [...] due to their senses of dark humour and morality, and praised McGee, Pistilli and Brega's acting. Cox also felt that Kinski's Loco was the actor's finest appearance in a Western, and that Trintignant's performance, which <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> doll-like in the hands of actors such as Franco Nero, John Phillip Law and Terence Hill, was pulled off [...] "flawlessly. His character's moral quandary, and decision to sacrifice himself, are perfectly conveyed". Noting that Corbucci seemed proud of The Great Silence – [...] "a great work, a great Spaghetti Western, a great Western, a classic of transgressive cinema" [...] – [...] Cox believes that Zanuck's withholding of the international release and its poor domestic performance were key factors in the decline in quality of Corbucci's output following its release.|$|E

2500|$|Zinaida {{started writing}} poetry {{at the age}} of seven. By the time she met Dmitry Merezhkovsky in 1888, she was already a {{published}} poet. [...] "By the year 1880 I was writing verses, being a great believer in 'inspiration', and making it a point never to take my pen away from paper. People around me saw these poems as a sign of my being 'spoiled', but I never tried to conceal them and, of course, I wasn't spoiled at all, what with my religious upbringing," [...] she wrote in 1902 in a letter to Valery Bryusov. A good-looking girl, Zinaida attracted a lot of attention in Borzhomi, but Merezhkovsky, a well-educated introvert, impressed her first and foremost as a perfect kindred spirit. Once he proposed, she accepted him without hesitation, and never came to regret what <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> a hasty decision.|$|E

40|$|John Calvin has a {{justified}} {{reputation as}} an aggressive, divisive theologian, but in his own terms he was an ecumenist, doing {{more than anyone else}} to forge Reformed Protestantism into a single body (against Rome).

2500|$|From 1443 {{until the}} French Revolution, several other parlements were {{steadily}} created all over France, until {{at the end}} of the Ancien Régime there were provincial parlements in: (clockwise from the north) Douai, Arras, Metz, Nancy, Colmar, Dijon, Besançon, Grenoble, Aix, Perpignan, Toulouse, Pau, Bordeaux, Rennes, and Rouen. These locations were provincial capitals of those provinces with strong historical traditions of independence before they were annexed to France. Assembled in the parlements, the largely hereditary members, the provincial nobles of the gown were the strongest decentralizing force in a France that was more multifarious in its legal systems, taxation, and custom than it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> under the apparent unifying rule of its kings. Nevertheless, the Parlement of Paris had the largest jurisdiction of all the parlements, covering the major part of northern and central France, and was simply known as [...] "the Parlement".|$|E
2500|$|As H. Kennedy comments, [...] "this {{surrender}} <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> {{the end of}} {{the family}} fortunes as it was for other local leaders in the area", but Hamdan's son, Husayn managed to preserve the family's fortunes. Husayn entered the Caliph's service and was instrumental in ending the Kharijite Rebellion and capturing its leader, Harun al-Shari. He was rewarded by the grateful Mu'tadid with a pardon for his father and the right to raise and command his own corps of Taghlibi horse, which he led on several expeditions over the next few years, becoming one of the Caliphate's most prominent commanders. His influence enabled him to become, in Kennedy's description, the [...] "intermediary between government and the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira", thereby cementing the family's dominance in the area and laying the foundation for the rise of the Hamdanid dynasty to power under his two nephews, Nasir al-Dawla and Sayf al-Dawla.|$|E
2500|$|One author {{described}} {{the early nineteenth}} century, the time of George Poulett Scrope and Charles Lyell's early careers, as an [...] "intellectual 'reign of terror'" [...] which was the [...] "consequence of the unreasoning prejudice and wild alarm excited by the early progress of geological inquiry." [...] Most attempts to explain the past using current processes as a reference was, rather than through calm argument, met by social stigma and intolerance. This {{can be seen by}} the treatment of Hutton's Theory of the Earth, Hall's meticulously kept records and experiments, and Playfair's Illustrations. These arguments had [...] "come to be inscribed in a social Index Expurgatorius [...] <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> to be consigned to total oblivion."

2500|$|Nazi {{approval}} of Braemer was not universal, however. During {{his tenure as}} the Wehrmachtbefehlshaber or territorial military commander of the Reichskommissariat Ostland, Braemer had (presumably) an immediate superior {{in the person of}} Reichskommissar (and Gauleiter) Hinrich Lohse, the overall governor of the Ostland who was likewise headquartered in Riga, Latvia. [...] While Lohse's slapping of Braemer on the face [...] in public [...] at the Riga Opera House during the banquet celebrating Hitler's birthday on 20April 1944 probably should not be made too much of, it is indicative nonetheless of the tensions simmering within the Nazi leadership in the Ostland and points at least to the possibility that even to high-ranking (but non-Wehrmacht and non-SS) Nazis like Lohse the methods used by Braemer in the implementation of the Holocaust <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> objectionable (if only on economic grounds, by depriving his administration of needed workforce), even if the event has also been put down to the incipient panic in the face of looming defeat or to personal rivalries between two Nazi apparatchiks vying for a position of pre-eminence within the Ostland bureaucracy. In some reports the punch from Lohse (meted out in response to Braemer's applying to Lohse the unparliamentary epithet of dummes Luder [...] "silly rotter") is said literally to have knocked Braemer to the ground. But the knockout blow appears to have been invested with figurative significance as well, as the incident marks Braemer's exit from the scene in Riga (on orders from the Wehrmacht which removed him that very day not only from the commandership of the Ostland but from active duty altogether) and, conversely, his promotion by the SS to the aforementioned higher rank of gruppenführer on the same day. Braemer was 61-years' old at the time.|$|E
