40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the short-term (2 weeks) effects of the herbicide <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> alone and in combination with the insecticide cypermethrin in freshwater enclosures (80 1). We used a factorial design with four levels of herbicide (0, 1, 5, 20 mug/ 1) and two levels of insecticide (0 and 0. 05 mug/ 1). The root growth of the macrophyte species Elodea canadensis and Myriophyllum spicatum decreased following exposure to the lowest concentration of <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> tested. <b>Metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> exposure resulted in a decreased pH in the aquatic enclosure at the lowest concentration tested, which is most likely a further indication of decreased macrophyte primary production. The biomass of periphytic algae growing on the leaves of M. spicatum increased in the enclosures exposed to <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl.</b> The species composition of the periphytic algae differed significantly from the controls in the enclosures exposed to 20 mug/ 1 of the herbicide. The increased biomass of periphytic algae on the leaves of the macrophytes is probably an indirect effect of the herbicide exposure. The exposure to <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> possibly induced a leakage of nutrients from the macrophyte leaves, which promoted an increased algal growth. The exposure to <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> did not alter the biomass or the species composition of the phytoplankton community. The zooplankton communities in the enclosures were dominated by rotifers, which were not affected by the exposure to cypermethrin. However, a cypermethrin exposure of 0. 05 mug/ 1 initially decreased the abundance of copepod nauplii. Ten days after exposure, the abundance of nauplii was significantly higher in the insecticide-exposed enclosures compared with the non-exposed enclosures. This might be an indication of a sub-lethal stress response, which either increased the number of offspring produced or induced an increased hatching of copepod resting stages. No combined effects of the herbicide and insecticide exposure, either direct or indirect, were observed in the enclosure study. Significant effects on the macrophytes were observed following exposure to 1 mug <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> per litre in the enclosure study. Furthermore, a single species laboratory assay indicated that the shoot elongation of E canadensis decreased following exposure to greater than or equal to 0. 1 mug <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> per litre. These concentrations are well within the range of expected environmental concentrations, thus this study shows that aquatic ecosystems, in particular those which are macrophyte-dominated, may be affected by <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> at concentrations that may well occur in water bodies adjacent to agricultural land.

40|$|International audienceThe {{degradation}} of the pesticide <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> was studied in aqueous solutions by using decatungstate anion, W 10 O 324 −, as a photocatalyst. An electron transfer process involving the highly oxidizing features of the decatungstate excited state, namely W 10 O 324 −*, was clearly observed. The degradation led to the oxidation of the pollutant {{and the formation of}} the decatungstate reduced species, i. e. W 10 O 325 −.

40|$|Bracken is {{a problem}} weed in pastures, forest clearings and nature reserves. Control methods such as {{defoliation}} {{and the use of}} herbicides are only effective in suppressing the weed for a limited period. The difficulty of controlling this plant is attributed to the large rhizome network that supports its continuous regrowth. The effect of using growth regulating factors, specifically the ethylene-releasing chemical ethephon and nitrogen (N) fertiliser, as pre-treatments to the application of the sulfonylurea herbicide <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> was investigated as a means of promoting the growth of rhizome buds and improving the delivery of herbicide to sites of regrowth in bracken. Aftermath effects of this integrated chemical control approach, including herbicide residual activity and potential allelopathic effects on associated vegetation, were also studied. Ethephon increased the translocation of 14 C deoxyglucose, a surrogate for herbicide, from source fronds to the rhizoine system. However, field studies in pastures found little evidence of enhanced control of bracken frond density when ethephon or N were used with the herbicide. The herbicide was highly effective on it's own at the rate used (40 g a. i. ha- 1), and this may have masked interactions with the growth factors. Differences between seasons, sites, and bracken populations may also have been important. There was some evidence for reduced bracken bud density 6 months after ethephon treatments were applied, but the results were not consistent across the ethephon rates used. Controlled environment studies revealed a moderate increase in crozier development when ethephon was applied to clonal plants, and this coincided. with increased concentrations of ethylene gas evolution measured on enclosed fronds. The well-known allelopathic effect of bracken was confirmed and herbicide treatment was found to enhance it. The potential for injury to crops like corn was noted at higher rates of application of <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> than those recommended for use in pastures. The suppression of frond growth for one year from herbicide application confirmed the effectiveness of <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl.</b> However, this period is only temporary as frond regrowth would be expected after a year or two and has the potential to return to pre-treatment levels without follow-up treatment. Further research is required to find more long-lasting control methods that reduce the need for repeated, expensive herbicide treatment to achieve control of this weed.

Treated areas were sown back to sorghum in the following spring, to sorghum and sunflower in summer, and to chickpea in the following autumn. Shoot dry matter at 3 weeks after emergence and grain yields were measured. Soil residue levels of chlorsulfuron were measured by bioassay following herbicide application and at sowing of sorghum and chickpea. Rainfall and temperature were recorded for each fallow period. The recropping intervals ranged from 2. 5 to 4. 1 months for spring sorghum, 2. 5 to 9. 3 months for summer sorghum and sunflower, and 5. 7 to 11. 7 months for chickpea. The shorter intervals were {{a consequence of the}} late spring applications.

40|$|Problem statement: The low organic soils of the Cumberland Plateau, {{as well as}} the karst geology of the region, may promote {{increased}} {{transport of}} herbicides outside of application sites. We have studied the fates of imazapyr and metsulfuron-methyl applied to a privately owned tract on the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee and compared the field results with herbicide fate predicted by the computer model GLEAMS. Approach: The fate of the two herbicides, applied for pine release at a site on the Cumberland Plateau, was monitored over a sixteen month period. Concentrations in soil water were monitored using vacuum soil lysimeters. Grab samples were taken of water in ephemeral streams draining the clearcut area and of a perennial stream which receives water from the study area. Uncut streamside management zones of about 50 m bordered the streams. The field results were compared with those obtained using the GLEAMS computer model. Results: Concentrations of both herbicides in soil water dropped significantly within the first two months after application, imazapyr to less than 50 µg L - 1 and <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> to less than 3 µg L - 1 and decreased more gradually in the following months. The maximum concentrations observed in soil water were 252 µg L - 1 (imazapyr) and 13 µg L - 1 (<b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl).</b> Except on two dates occurring 5 months after application, the herbicides were not detected in the stream samples. GLEAMS predicted that very little herbicide should have been lost from the site in runoff or erosion sediment. The model predicted greater retention of the herbicides by the soil than was found through the field measurements. Conclusion/Recommendation: The rapid transport of imazapyr and metsulfuron we observed indicates that further study is justified at other locations on the Cumberland Plateau.

40|$|Parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{aggressive}} herbaceous weeds of the Asteraceae family. It is widely distributed, almost across the world and has become the most important invasive weed. Comprehensive information on interference and control of this devastating species is required to facilitate better management decisions. A broad review on the interference and management of this weed is presented here. Inspite of its non-tropical origin, parthenium grows quite successfully under a wide range of environmental conditions. It is spreading rapidly in Australia, Western Africa, Asia, and Caribbean countries, and has become a serious weed of pastures, wastelands, roadsides, railwaysides, water courses, and agricultural crops. The infestations of parthenium have been reported to reduce grain and forage yields by 40 - 90 %. The spread of parthenium has been attributed to its allelopathic activity, strong competitiveness for soil moisture and nutrients, and its capability to exploit natural biodiversity. Allelochemicals released from parthenium has been reported to decrease germination and growth of agronomic crops, vegetables, trees, and many other weed species. Growth promoting effects of parthenium extracts at low concentrations have also been reported in certain crops. Many pre- and post-emergence herbicides have been evaluated for the control of parthenium in cropped and non-cropped areas. The most effective herbicides are clomazone, metribuzin, atrazine, glyphosate, <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl,</b> butachlor, bentazone, dicamba, and <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl.</b> Extracts, residues, and essential oils of many allelopathic herbs (Cassia, Amaranthus, and Xanthium species), grasses (Imperata and Desmostachya species), and trees (Eucalyptus, Azadirachta, Mangifera species, etc.) have demonstrated inhibitory activities on seed germination and seedling growth of parthenium. Metabolites of several fungi, e. g., Fusarium oxysporun and Fusarium monilifonne, exhibit bioherbicidal activity against seeds and seedlings of this weed. Intercropping, displacement by competitive plant species like Cassia species, bisset bluegrass, florgen blugress, buffelgrass, along with the use of biological control agents like Mexican beetle, seed-feeding and stem-boring weevils, stem-galling and leaf-mining moth, and sap-feeding plant hopper, have been reported as possible strategies for the management of parthenium. An appropriate integration of these approaches could help minimize spread of parthenium and provide sustainable weed management with reduced environmental concerns...|$|E

Two experiments were carried out using a randomized experimental block design, in a 4 × 3 factorial scheme, with four replications. Treatments in the first experiment were formed by four doses (0. 00, 0. 54, 1. 08 and 1. 62 kg ha - 1) of glyphosate, associated with three doses (0. 00, 0. 806 and 1. 209 kg ha - 1) of 2, 4 -D. In the second experiment the same doses of glyphosate were studied associated with three doses (0. 0 4. 0 and 8. 0 g ha - 1) of metsulfuron-methyl. Visual evaluations of plant poisoning, score number of plants with regrowth and dry matter of plants were determined. It was concluded that glyphosate applied alone or in association with 2. 4 -D or metsulfuron-methyl, regardless of the applied doses, was ineffective in the desiccation of mature plants of Crotalaria juncea...|$|E
40|$|Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS, EC 2. 2. 1. 6) is {{the target}} for the {{sulfonylurea}} herbicides, which act as potent inhibitors of the enzyme. Chlorsulfuron (marketed as Glean) and sulforneturon methyl (marketed as Oust) are two commercially important members of this family of herbicides. Here we report crystal structures of yeast AHAS in complex with chlorsulfuron (at a resolution of 2. 19 Angstrom), sulforneturon methyl (2. 34 Angstrom), and two other sulfonylureas, <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> (2. 29 Angstrom) and tribenuron methyl (2. 58 Angstrom). The structures observed suggest why these inhibitors have different potencies and provide clues about the differential effects of mutations in the active site tunnel on various inhibitors. In all of the structures, the thiamin diphosphate cofactor is fragmented, possibly {{as the result of}} inhibitor binding. In addition to thiamin diphosphate, AHAS requires FAD for activity. Recently, {{it has been reported that}} reduction of FAD can occur as a minor side reaction due to reaction with the carbanion/enamine of the hydroxyethyl-ThDP intermediate that is formed midway through the catalytic cycle. Here we report that the isoalloxazine ring has a bent conformation that would account for its ability to accept electrons from the hydroxyethyl intermediate.

Pretreatment of corn seeds with commercial 1, 8 -naphthalic anhydride (NA) at 1 % (w/w) partially reversed MSM-induced root growth inhibition. MSM at a concentration of 52 nanomoles per liter was taken up rapidly by roots and accumulated in the corn tissue to concentrations three times those in the external medium; the safener NA increased MSM uptake up to 48 hours. The protective effect of NA {{was related to the}} ability of the safener to increase the metabolism of MSM; tenfold increases in the metabolic rates of MSM were observed in NA-pretreated corn seedlings grown for 48 hours on 52 nanomolar [14 C]MSM solution. DNA synthesis determined by measurement of [3 H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was inhibited by root MSM applications; after a 6 -hour application period, 13 nanomolar MSM solution reduced DNA synthesis by 64 %, and the same reduction was also observed with NA-pretreated seedlings.

Herein,capillary electrophoresis (CE) was used to determine four sulfonylureas in natural waters, namely chlor-sulfuron (CS), iodosulfuron methyl (IM), <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> (MSM) and mesosulfuron methyl (MSS). First of all, a bare silica capillary was chosen with 10 mM of 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoro-borate (bminBF 4) as electrophoretic buffer (pH 9. 6) containing 2 mg L− 1 of surfactant-coated single-wallcarbon nanotubes (SC-SWCNTs). A dramatic deviation in migration times was observed. Therefore, apoly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride (PDADMAC) statically coated cationic capillary was used toimprove repeatability and to alter the selectivity of the separation. The electroosmotic flow (EOF) mea-surement revealed that the SC-SWCNTs were strongly adsorbed at the surface of the PDADMAC coatingeven in the absence of the surfactant-coated nanotubes in the electrolyte buffer. Consequently, a stablestrong cathodic EOF and excellent repeatabilities were obtained with relative standard deviations (RSDs) on migration times and on corrected peak areas below 0. 9 and 1. 5 %, respectively. The separation of theSUs was conducted in only 6 min. No regeneration of the coating between analyses was necessary, andhigh peak efficiencies up to 173, 000 theoretical plates were obtained.

40|$|We analyse {{the cost}} of {{controlling}} the invasive quinine tree Cinchona pubescens Vahl in the highlands of Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos. Control costs in ten 400 m 2 plots {{formed the basis for}} estimating {{the cost of}} control over the whole island. In the plots, densities were 2100 – 24, 000 stems/ha (stems > 150 cm tall) and 55, 000 – 138, 000 stems/ha (all size classes combined). Control involved uprooting small plants, and applying of a mix of <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> and picloram to cut stumps or to machete cuts in the bark of larger trees. These methods are presently used by Galapagos National Park field crews to control quinine. Costs (in man hours, herbicide and US) were related to stem density; the density of stems summed across four height classes was a better predictor of costs than density of any one size class. Regressions (on all size classes combined) formed the basis for predictive models of costs. Costs ranged from 14 to 2225 per ha depending on stem density. The amount of herbicide (active ingredient/ha) that must be applied to high density stands of quinine is higher than typical rates of application in an agricultural setting. The cost of treating all existing plants once across quinine’s known range on Santa Cruz Island (c. 11, 000 ha) was estimated at c. US 1. 65 million. CDF Contribution Number 1013...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRationaleSulfonylureas {{are among}} the most {{important}} class of antidiabetic and herbicides. Solar light excitation and Advanced Oxidation Processes may result in the formation of a wide array of products owing to the relative complex structure. These products, that should be identified, may present a more toxic effect than the parent compound. MethodsLiquid chromatography/electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-QTOFMS) with accurate mass determination emerges as a valuable technique for the precise elucidation of all possible byproducts. The hydroxyl radical was generated by excitation of the iron(III) aquacomplex [Fe(H 2 O) OH] 2 + and hydrogen peroxide at pH[*] 3. 5. Three different sulfonylureas were studied: <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl,</b> cinosulfuron and thifensulfuron methyl. ResultsSeveral products owing to the reactivity of hydroxyl radicals with sulfonylurea were obtained. They arise from scission of the sulfonylurea bridge, hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, demethylation of the methoxy group and more importantly and unequivocally from the rupture of the triazine skeleton. To reach such scission, a primary demethylation of the methoxy group on the triazine moiety seems to act as a precursor process. Such a process was observed with the three studied sulfonylurea compounds. ConclusionsThe reported results demonstrated the usefulness of accurate mass measurements undertaken by LC/ESI-QTOFMS for structural elucidation of the unknown byproducts that were generated during hydroxyl radical reactions with some sulfonylureas. It has been possible herein to identify the structures of products arising from the opening of the recalcitrant triazine structure via hydrolysis processes in acidic solutions.

40|$|World-wide, {{sediment}} is {{the major}} water quality problem. The use of herbicides for controlling competing vegetation during stand establishment can be beneficial to forest ecosystem sustainability and water quality by minimising off-site soil loss, reducing on-site soil and organic matter displacement, and preventing deterioration of soil physical properties. Sediment losses from sites where competing vegetation is controlled by mechanical methods can be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude greater than natural losses from undisturbed watersheds. On a watershed basis, vegetation management techniques in general increase annual erosion by < 7 %. Herbicides do not increase natural erosion rates. Organic matter and nutrients that are critical to long-term site productivity can be removed off-site by mechanical vegetation-management techniques and fire, or redistributed on-site {{in a manner that}} reduces availability to the next stand. For several decades, research has been conducted on the fate of forestry-use herbicides in various watersheds throughout the southern and western United States, Canada, and Australia. This research has evaluated chemicals such as 2, 4 -D, glyphosate, hexazinone, imazapyr, <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl,</b> picloram, sulfometuron methyl, tebuthiuron, and triclopyr. Losses in streamflow, and leaching to groundwater have been evaluated. Field study data indicate that residue concentrations tend to be low, except where direct applications are made to ephemeral channels or streams, and do not persist for extended periods of time. Regional environmental impact statements in the United States demonstrate that forestry herbicide presence in surface and groundwater is not a significant risk to water quality or human health. They also clearly indicate that herbicides can greatly reduce water quality deterioration that is produced by erosion and sedimentation...|$|E

The objectives of this experiment were to determine the effects of prescribed fire or herbicides on the density of forbs, the production and nutritive value of the herbage, and the performance of beef steers grazing Yellow bluestem [Bothriochloa ischaemum (L.) Keng var. ischaemum (Hack.) Celarier and Harlan] pastures. The experiment was conducted in northwestern Oklahoma from 1998 through 2000, and the untreated pastures (control) were not burned or sprayed. The prescribed-fire treatment (PFT) occurred annually between March 27 and April 10. The herbicide treatment (HT) consisted of an annual application of 0. 9 kg of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2. 8 g of <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> per hectare. Compared with the control, forb densities were or tended to be decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 13) in PFT and HT pastures only in May and June of 1998; forb densities were not affected (P ≥ 0. 45) in later months or years. Dry matter production of Yellow bluestem in August was not affected (P ≥ 0. 10) by treatment, but CP concentration and in vitro OM disappearance were greater (P ≤ 0. 05) in herbage collected early in the grazing season from PFT pastures than in that from control and HT pastures. Over the 92 -d grazing period that started May 30 (initial stocking rate, 1. 93 steers/ha), ADG and BW gain per hectare did not differ (P ≥ 0. 74) among treatments.

40|$|With over 90, 000 {{miles of}} road in Indiana, it is {{important}} that adjoining vegetation be maintained for safety, road structure maintenance and aesthetics. An understanding of vegetation management tools, the disturbance they cause and the effect of that disturbance on the plant community are important when designing an integrated vegetation management (IVM) program. In this study, I examine multiple components of an IVM plan for the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT), including mowing regimes, selective broadleaf control, plant growth regulators and native species plantings. ^ The first portion of this study examines the use of herbicide and mowing at six sites throughout the state of Indiana. Two mowing treatments, six herbicide treatments, and an untreated control were compared for their ability to decrease dicot species cover and maintain grass height. Mowing treatments included a one-cycle mowing treatment consisting of an early growing season mow (late May to early June 2011) and a two-cycle mowing treatment consisting of both an early (late May to early June 2011) and late growing season mow(August 2011). Herbicide treatments were foliar applied in May 2001 and included tank mixes consisting of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D®), aminopyralid (Milestone ®), and <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> (Escort®), imazapic (Plateau®),and aminocclopyrachlor (Perspective®, Viewpoint® and Streamline®). We found that dicot cover in all herbicide treatments was reduced rapidly and remained low into the second growing season. Herbicide treatments also regulated grass growth, keeping grass under 15 inches for three months after application. In comparison, mowing treatments provided no decrease in dicot cover and the early season mowing provide little control over grass height. ^ For the second portion of the study, four native seed mixes (western wheatgrass, short grass, tall grass and short grass with forbs) were analyzed for use alternatives to traditional non-native roadside vegetation. Determination of successful planting was based on density of planted species at 90 days and one year after planting at six sites throughout the state of Indiana. Drought and persistent weeds at study sites resulted in a sparse covering of native species during the year after planting; however, this is not uncommon for native roadside planting studies since many native grass species require two to three growing seasons to establish. ...|$|E
40|$|Group B {{herbicides}} {{inhibit the}} acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS - {{also known as}} acetolactate synthase) enzyme in the pathway of branched chain amino acid synthesis. These herbicides have gained widespread use in Australia, however potential impacts on nitrogen fixation by legumes have not been comprehensively assessed. Group B herbicides recommended for in-crop application to grain and pasture legume species were assessed for impacts on growth, nodulation and nitrogen fixation. Although it was demonstrated that nitrogen fixation can be affected by these herbicides, the range of responses indicated that multiple mechanisms could be responsible. These could include a reduction nitrogen fixation directly coupled to reduced plant growth; more specific and direct disruption of nitrogen fixation related to the inhibition of nodulation; or other mechanisms yet to be defined that could include affects on the rhizobia. To begin to understand these mechanisms, a herbicide tolerant Medicago littoralis cultivar ‘FEH- 1 ’ was compared to Herald. Decreased nodulation, nitrogen fixation and acetylene reduction activity due to herbicide application were primarily related to the susceptibility of the plant to the herbicide. Thus herbicide tolerant legumes {{have the potential to}} alleviate suboptimal nitrogen fixation due to group B herbicides. A proteomics study of the response of root tips of model legume Medicago truncatula A 17 to flumetsulam and <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> was conducted to identify more specifically the herbicide impacts on plant physiology. An increased abundance of stress response proteins and a decline in the abundance of some metabolic proteins was found, including a reduction in the abundance of glutamine synthetase which is expected to have direct consequences for the regulation of nitrogen fixation. Observations of root morphology revealed changes to root hairs and the development of lateral roots related to the disruption of meristems, with likely consequences for infection and nodule development. The results from this thesis confirm the potential for acetohydroxyacid synthase inhibiting herbicides to reduce nitrogen fixation of legumes. In addition to a general effect on nitrogen fixation via coupling to reduced plant growth, more specific biochemical and morphological mechanisms that disrupt nodulation are plausible. Thesis (Ph.

Yellow Himalayan raspberry (Rubus ellipticus Sm.), introduced to Hawai'i Island approximately 30 years ago, has become a serious pest in the 'Ola'a Tract of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. This shade-tolerant raspberry forms dense thickets, which replace native understory vegetation. Four herbicides were effective cut-stump treatments for yellow raspberry: imazapyr (Arsenal, 50 % in water), triclopyr triethyl mine salt (Garlon 3 4 50 % in water), triclopyr butoxyethyl ester (Garlon 4, 50 % in diesel oil), and <b>metsulfuron</b> <b>methyl</b> (Escort, 28 gm/liter water). Ninety-five to one hundred percent of raspberry plants treated with these chemicals died within 24 months. With each of the four treatments, 10 - 15 % of raspberry plants resprouted from the roots, but {{at least half of the}} resprouts later died. Two other herbicides tested were much less effective at killing raspberry. Picloram potassium salt (Tordon 22 K, 20 % in water) killed only 65 % of treated plants, and a commercial mix of 2, 4 D and triclopyr (Crossbow, 50 % in diesel oil) caused the death of 75 % of treated raspberry. Fifteen common native plant species and 10 others of sporadic occurrence were monitored for a year in plots surrounding treated raspberry plants. No statistically significant changes in number were observed for any native species in any herbicide treatment. In general, the number of individuals taller than 0. 1 m counted in herbicide plots increased over the year for six common native fern species, one sedge, and one herb. Results were more variable for seven native woody species common in study plots, with increases in numbers in some treatments and small decreases in others. Both picloram and imazapyr plots displayed losses in a larger variety of native woody species than were observed in the other treatments. Saplings of one native tree, olomea (Perrottetia sandwicensis) appeared to be particularly sensitive to both picloram and imazapyr applied to nearby raspberry stumps.
