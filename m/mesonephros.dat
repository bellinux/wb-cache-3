25|$|The <b>mesonephros</b> {{persists}} {{and form}} the permanent kidneys in fish and amphibians, but in reptiles, birds, and mammals, it atrophies {{and for the}} most part disappears rapidly as the permanent kidney (metanephros) develops beginning during the sixth or seventh week, so that by the beginning of the fifth month only the ducts and a few of the tubules of the <b>mesonephros</b> remain.|$|E
25|$|The urinary and {{reproductive}} organs are {{developed from the}} intermediate mesoderm. The permanent organs of the adult are preceded {{by a set of}} structures which are purely embryonic, and which {{with the exception of the}} ducts disappear almost entirely before the end of fetal life. These embryonic structures are on either side; the pronephros, the <b>mesonephros</b> and the metanephros of the kidney, and the Wolffian and Müllerian ducts of the sex organ. The pronephros disappears very early; the structural elements of the <b>mesonephros</b> mostly degenerate, but the gonad is developed in their place, with which the Wolffian duct remains as the duct in males, and the Müllerian as that of the female. Some of the tubules of the <b>mesonephros</b> form part of the permanent kidney.|$|E
25|$|The {{mammalian}} kidney develops from intermediate mesoderm. Kidney development, {{also called}} nephrogenesis, proceeds {{through a series}} of three successive developmental phases: the pronephros, <b>mesonephros,</b> and metanephros. The metanephros are primordia of the permanent kidney.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of vertebrates, the <b>mesonephros</b> persists into the adult, albeit usually fused with the more advanced metanephros; only in amniotes is the <b>mesonephros</b> restricted to the embryo. The kidneys of fish and amphibians are typically narrow, elongated organs, occupying {{a significant portion of}} the trunk. The collecting ducts from each cluster of nephrons usually drain into an archinephric duct, which is homologous with the vas deferens of amniotes. However, the situation is not always so simple; in cartilaginous fish and some amphibians, there is also a shorter duct, similar to the amniote ureter, which drains the posterior (metanephric) parts of the kidney, and joins with the archinephric duct at the bladder or cloaca. Indeed, in many cartilaginous fish, the anterior portion of the kidney may degenerate or cease to function altogether in the adult.|$|E
25|$|The {{periphery}} of the testes are converted into the tunica albuginea. Cords of the central mass run together and form a network which becomes the rete testis, and another network, which develops the seminiferous tubules. Via the rete testis, the seminiferous tubules become connected with outgrowths from the <b>mesonephros,</b> which form the efferent ducts of the testis.|$|E
25|$|On {{the medial}} {{side of the}} Wolffian duct, from the sixth {{cervical}} to the third lumbar segments, a series of tubules, the Wolffian tubules, develops. They increase in number by outgrowths from the original tubules. They change from solid masses of cells to instead become hollowed in the center. One end grows toward and finally opens into the Wolffian duct, the other dilates and is invaginated by a tuft of capillary bloodvessels to form a glomerulus. The tubules collectively constitute the <b>mesonephros.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the male}} the duct persists, and forms the tube of the epididymis, the ductus deferens and the {{ejaculatory}} duct, while the seminal vesicle arises {{during the third}} month as a lateral diverticulum from its hinder end. A {{large part of the}} head end of the <b>mesonephros</b> atrophies and disappears; of the remainder the anterior tubules form the efferent ducts of the testis; while the posterior tubules are represented by the ductuli aberrantes, and by the paradidymis, which is sometimes found in front of the spermatic cord above the head of the epididymis.|$|E
25|$|The renal corpuscles and renal tubules, in contrast, are {{developed}} from the metanephrogenic blastema instead of from the ureteric bud. The metanephrogenic blastema is moulded over the growing end of the latter, and becomes {{a part of the}} metanephros in this way. The renal tubules of the metanephros, unlike those of the pronephros and <b>mesonephros,</b> do not open into the Wolffian duct. Instead, the tubules rapidly elongate to form the parts of the nephron: the proximal tubules, the loops of Henle and the distal convoluted tubules. These last join and establish communications with the collecting duct system derived from the ultimate ramifications of the ureteric bud. In the other end, the renal tubules give rise to Bowman's capsules and glomeruli.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the adult}} male: [...] Pronephros disappears. [...] The Mullerian duct (? = pronephric duct) disappears. [...] <b>Mesonephros</b> = Epididymis; its duct, the urogenital.

60|$|Section 19. The {{student should}} now compare the figures on Sheet 17. In the male, tubular {{connections}} are established between the testes {{and the middle}} part of the primitive kidney (<b>mesonephros).</b> These connections are the vasa efferentia (v.e.), and the <b>mesonephros</b> is now equivalent to the epididymis of the rabbit. The Wolffian duct is the urogenital duct of the adult, and the Mullerian duct is entirely absorbed, or remains, more or less, in exceptional cases.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the adult}} female: [...] Pronephros disappears. [...] The Mullerian duct, the oviduct. [...] <b>Mesonephros</b> and Metanephros, the kidney, and their {{unseparated}} [...] ducts, the ureters.|$|E
60|$|In the female, the Mullerian duct {{increases}} {{greatly in}} length-- {{so that at}} sexual maturity its white coils appear thicker and longer than the intestine-- and becomes the oviduct; the Wolffian duct is the ureter, and the <b>mesonephros</b> is not perverted in function from its primary renal duty.|$|E

60|$|Section 19. Figure 3, Sheet 17, is a {{generalized}} {{diagram of the}} uro-genital organs in the vertebrata; M.L. is the middle line of the body, G. is the genital organ, Pr. is the pronephros, or fore kidney, a structure which is never developed in the dog-fish, but which has functional importance in the tadpole and cod, and appears as a transitory rudiment in the chick. A duct, which is often spoken of as the pronephric duct (p.d.), and which we have figured under that name, is always developed. Anteriorly it opens into the body cavity. It is also called the Mullerian duct, and in {{the great majority of}} vertebrata it becomes the oviduct, uniting with its fellow, {{in the case of the}} dog-fish, ventral to the oesophagus. In the male it usually disappears; the uterus masculinus of the rabbit is still very generally regarded as a vestige of it. Kolliker has shown, however, that this interpretation is improbable. Ms. is the <b>mesonephros,</b> some or all of which becomes the epididymis in the male of types possessing that organ, and is connected with G. by the vasa efferentia. Mt., the metanephros, is, in -actual fact- [the frog], indistinguishably continuous with Ms., and is the functional kidney, its duct (metanephric duct) being either undifferentiated from the mesonephric (as is the case with the frog) or largely split off from it, as in the dog-fish, to form the ureter.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>mesonephros</b> (middle kidney) is one {{of three}} {{excretory}} organs that develop in vertebrates. It serves as the main excretory organ of aquatic vertebrates and as a temporary kidney in reptiles, birds, and mammals.

(The Wolffian body is composed of: <b>mesonephros</b> + paramesonephrotic blastema) ...|$|E
5000|$|Kerr {{coined the}} term ‘opisthonephros’ in 1919. In 1949, Hyman wrote the opisthonephros “has used up the mesomere tissue from which in amniotes both <b>mesonephros</b> and metanephros come.” [...] Some {{accounts}} call opisthonephros the ‘mesonephros’, but the opisthonephros in anamniotes (lampreys, fish, and amphibians) differ considerably than the <b>mesonephros</b> in amniotes (reptiles, birds, and mammals). Thus, the term <b>mesonephros</b> is usually reserved for the embryonic kidney of amniotes.|$|E

50|$|The most {{significant}} {{function of the}} aorta gonad <b>mesonephros</b> region is its role in definitive haematopoiesis. Definitive haematopoiesis is the second wave of embryonic haematopoiesis and give rise to all hematopoietic stem cells in the adult hematopoietic system. The aorta gonad <b>mesonephros</b> region {{has been shown to}} harbour multipotent hematopoietic colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S) progenitor cells and pluripotential long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LTR-HSCs). In contrast to the yolk sac, the extra-embryonic haematopoietic site, the number of CFU-S was much greater in the aorta gonad <b>mesonephros</b> region. LTR-HSC activity was also found in the aorta gonad <b>mesonephros</b> region at a slightly earlier time than in the yolk sac and foetal liver. Thus indicating the potency of definitive haematopoiesis from this region. Furthermore, isolated organ cultures of the AGM from mice embryos can autonomously initiate hematopoietic stem cell activity, without influence from the yolk sac or liver. At 10 days post coitus (d.p.c.) the aorta gonad <b>mesonephros</b> region was able to initiate and expand definitive haematopoietic stem cell activity, whereas no haematopoietic activity was seen in the yolk sac until 11 d.p.c. This is the same case in human embryos, where they are first detected at day 27 in the aorta gonad <b>mesonephros</b> region, expand rapidly at day 35, then disappear at day 40. This “disappearance” correlates to the migration of these hematopoietic stem cells to the foetal liver, where it becomes the subsequent site of haematopoiesis.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Sertoli cells may derive from the fetal <b>mesonephros.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In mice, the genital ridge {{houses the}} {{transcript}} for Sry, the Y-chromosomal gene responsible for sex determination in mammals. The urogenital ridge {{is made up}} of the gonadal anlage and the <b>mesonephros.</b> The <b>mesonephros</b> is involved {{in the development of the}} testis, but its role is in differentiation, and not determination. This is indicated by the absence of Sry expression in the <b>mesonephros.</b> Sry expression is expressed exclusively in the developing gonad, lacking a presence in any other tissue in embryos or adults. The presence of Sry in the genital ridge results in testis formation by directing the differentiation of Sertoli cells in a bipotential genital ridge. (Jeske 1995) ...|$|E
