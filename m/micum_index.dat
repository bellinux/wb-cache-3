40|$|Nigeria is {{endowed with}} large {{deposits}} of high grade iron ore but reserves of suitable coking coals areextremely meager necessitating {{looking into the}} option of utilising lower rank coals. In this work, theproperties of three Nigerian coals (Onyeama, Lafia-Obi and Garin Maiganga), are investigated to determinetheir suitability in developing formed coke for use as blast furnace coke. Parameters that wereused include the shatter index, expressed as percentage stability and friability and <b>micum</b> <b>index.</b> Thehighest cummulative percentage stability and the lowest cummulative percentage friability was observed inLafia-Obi with values of 67. 54 % and 32. 46 %, followed by Onyeama with 66. 92 % and 33. 08 % and thenGarin Maiganga with 55. 04 % and 44. 96 % respectiely. Medium and low temperature carbonization ofOnyeama and Lafia-Obi coal samples gave an improved and satisfactory percentage stability and friability forthe semi-cokes. The percentage stability and friability are indicators of charge performance in the furnaceand are within the range allowed for low shaft furnace except for Garin Maiganga whose stability indexis low. The <b>micum</b> <b>index</b> (I 20), show that Lafia-Obi has {{the highest percentage of}} 31 %, followed byOnyeama with 28 %, and then Garin Maiganga with 23 %. These show that Onyeama and Lafia-Obisemi-cokes have fair abrasive and impact resistance. Size consistency allows for good flow of gasesthrough the charge. The results obtained indicate that Onyeama and Lafia-Obi semi-cokes have reasonablestrength and hardness for use in the blast furnace...|$|E
40|$|A coal blend {{consisting}} of 95 % Australian Agro-Allied coal and 5 % Nigerian non-caking Okaba coal wascarbonized in a 250 kg capacity coke oven at a flue temperature of 1, 250 oC by normal wet and preheatedcharging for 18 and 15 hours, respectively. Screen distribution analysis and micum drum tests on thecoke products gave M 10 of 24. 60 % and 9. 5 % and M 40 of 67 % and 76. 2 %, for normal and preheatedcharge, respectively. These {{results showed that}} the coke produced from the preheated charge has abetter resistance to abrasion (M 10) and fragmentation (M 40) and the <b>micum</b> <b>indices</b> obtained are similarto the micum characteristics of cokes produced in coke ovens in some other countries. Furthermore,the coke micum 10 and micum 40 strength are very close to the M 10 and M 40 specifications for coketo be used for blast furnace operations at the Ajaokuta Steel Plant, Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|The Polish Bellview, Australian Agro-Allied and American Carbon Energy coals were {{subjected}} to Ruhrdilatometric analysis to predict their suitability for cokemaking. The Ruhr dilatometric softening point,maximum contraction, maximum dilatation, maximum contraction temperature and the G-value cokingcapacities were determined from which G-values of 0. 97, 0. 93, 0. 94 and 1. 01 were calculated forBellview 1, Bellview 2, Agro-Allied, and Carbon Energy respectively. Also, <b>micum</b> 10 <b>indices</b> of 11. 40 %, 15. 40 %, 15. 40 % and 25 % and <b>micum</b> 40 <b>indices</b> of 77. 80 %, 70. 80 %, 78. 20 %, and 64. 16 %,respectively were determined for Bellview 1, Bellview 2, Agro-Allied and Carbon Energy coals. Thestudies confirmed that Simonis’ G-value provides a reliable indication of coke micum strength indices,with the two strength parameters found to be poor at G-values below and above the Simonis’ rangeof 0. 95 to 1. 15. The analysis results showed that Bellview 1 with the nearly mid-value cokingcapacity of 0. 97 has the best combination of resistance to abrasion and fragmentation...|$|R
40|$|The {{pilot scale}} {{carbonization}} of the normally charged bituminous Polish Bellview coal blends wasconducted in a 250 kg capacity coke oven with a bulk density of 800 kg/m 3, flue temperature of 1250 °Cand coking time of 18 to 20 hours. The micum drum test conducted on Bellview A and B cokes gaveM 10 abrasion resistance of 11. 40 % and 15. 40 % and M 40 resistance to fragmentation of 77. 80 % and 70. 80 % for Bellview coke A and B, respectively. The {{results of this}} study showed that Bellview A coalblend is of a higher bituminous grade than Bellview blend B, though its <b>micum</b> <b>indices</b> do not meet thespecification of 9 % (maximum) M 10 and 78 % (minimum) M 40 for blast furnace ironmaking at theNigerian Ajaokuta steel plant. It is however expected that the small deviations of + 2. 4 % and - 0. 2 %,in the M 10 and M 40 of Bellview B coke may be eliminated during industrial scale cokemaking under ahigher static load and the application of coking improvement techniques such as pre-heating andstamp charging...|$|R
