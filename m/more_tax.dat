5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the costs associated with}} staff, Minnesota lost some revenue during the shutdown. The Minnesota State Lottery did not sell tickets during the shutdown, which meant the state could have lost about $1.25 million in revenue daily. Minnesota stopped selling tax stamps for cigarettes, which must be affixed to each pack before sale. The Star Tribune reported that cigarette sales would come to a halt by mid-August if no <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> stamps were issued. The state also stopped issuing liquor purchasing cards, which businesses need in order to purchase liquor from wholesalers. Many stores, bars, and restaurants renewed their liquor purchasing cards before the shutdown. However, the purchasing cards for approximately three hundred establishments expired {{on the first day of}} the shutdown, July 1. Liquor purchasing cards would have continued to expire on the first day of each month. Alcohol brand licenses expired, so MillerCoors lost their license to sell 39 brands of beer in Minnesota, and had to have them removed from shelves.|$|E
5|$|The first {{traces of}} large nobility {{meetings}} in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania {{can be found in}} the Treaty of Salynas of 1398 and the Union of Horodło of 1413. It is considered that the first Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania met in Hrodna in 1445 during talks between Casimir IV Jagiellon and the Lithuanian Council of Lords. As the Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars raged the country almost continuously between 1492 and 1582, the Grand Duke needed <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> revenues to finance the army and had to call the Seimas more frequently. In exchange for cooperation, the nobility demanded various privileges, including strengthening of the Seimas. At first the Seimas did not have the legislative power. It would debate on foreign and domestic affairs, taxes, wars, state budget. At the beginning of the 16th century, the Seimas acquired some legislative powers. The Seimas could petition the Grand Duke to pass certain laws.|$|E
25|$|Taxation is {{constraint}} by {{the fiscal}} and legal capacities of a country. Fiscal and legal capacities are also complement of each other. A well-designed tax system can minimize efficiency loss and boost economic growth. With better compliance and better support to {{financial institutions and}} individual property, the government {{will be able to}} collect <b>more</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} days of the Roman Republic, public taxes {{consisted}} of modest assessments on owned wealth and property. The tax rate under normal circumstances was 1% and sometimes would climb as high as 3% in situations such as war. These modest taxes were levied against land, homes and other real estate, slaves, animals, personal items and monetary wealth. The more a person had in property, the <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> they paid. Taxes were collected from individuals.|$|E
25|$|These {{state offices}} {{could be lost}} by a family at the {{unexpected}} death of the office holder. In an attempt to gain <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> revenues, the king's financial advisor, financier Charles Paulet, instituted the Paulette in 1604. This was a yearly tax of 1/60th {{of the price of}} the office that insured hereditary transmission. This annual tax solidified the hereditary acquisition of public office in France, and {{by the middle of the}} 17th century the majority of office holders were already noble from long possession of thereof.|$|E
25|$|Under the Pataki Administration, New York's {{credit rating}} was {{increased}} three times by Moody's Investors Service, {{a fact that}} he highlighted often before his critics. During his three terms in office, he introduced and approved <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> cuts {{than any of his}} predecessors. Following through on a campaign promise, Pataki led a push to cut both the individual and the corporate tax rates in New York. New York's infamously high income tax rate dropped by 20% on average, but an economic downturn following the attacks of September 11 and increasing state spending caused Sheldon Silver and Joseph Bruno to coordinate an effort to roll back a number of these cuts in 2003 over Pataki's veto power.|$|E

25|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and {{its impact}} on the {{alternative}} minimum tax (AMT) reduced nominal rates on the wealthy and eliminated tax deductions, while raising tax rates on lower-income individuals. The across the board tax system reduced marginal rates and further reduced bracket creep from inflation. The highest income earners (with incomes exceeding $1,000,000) received a tax break, restoring a flatter tax system. In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report characterized the effective rise in the AMT for individuals as a problem with the tax code. Through 2007, the revised AMT had brought in <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> revenue than the former tax code, which has made it difficult for Congress to reform.|$|E
500|$|In a BBC interview, Gates claimed [...] "I've paid <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> {{than any}} {{individual}} ever, and gladly so... I've paid over $6 billion in taxes." [...] He is {{a proponent of}} higher taxes, particularly for the rich.|$|E
500|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that the rhyme records the attempt by King Charles I to reform the taxes on liquid measures. He was blocked by Parliament, so subsequently ordered that the volume of a Jack (1/2 pint) be reduced, but the tax remained the same. This meant that he still received <b>more</b> <b>tax,</b> despite Parliament's veto. Hence [...] "Jack fell down and broke his crown" [...] (many pint glasses in the UK still have a line marking the 1/2 pint level with a crown above it) [...] "and Jill came tumbling after". The reference to [...] "Jill" [...] (actually a [...] "gill", or 1/4 pint) is said to reflect that the gill dropped in volume as a consequence.|$|E
5000|$|The {{treasury}} of Bohol Province has deposited {{some tax}} revenues in FCB as of March 2013, {{in their effort}} to collect <b>more</b> <b>taxes</b> owed. [...] The Social Security System cited FCB in their 2013 awards.|$|R
50|$|Caracalla (211-217) granted Roman {{citizenship}} to all Egyptians, {{in common with}} the other provincials, but this was mainly to extort <b>more</b> <b>taxes,</b> which grew increasingly onerous as the needs of the emperors for more revenue grew more desperate.|$|R
50|$|Monein {{was also}} a very rich village as it paid <b>more</b> <b>taxes</b> than Orthez and Oloron together, {{and it was one}} of the largest communes in Béarn because it was {{composed}} of the villages of Cuqueron and Cardesse.|$|R
500|$|The Whigs chose Attorney General James Harlan {{to oppose}} Breckinridge, but he withdrew in March when some party factions opposed him. Robert P. Letcher, a former {{governor}} who had not lost in 14 elections, was the Whigs' second choice. Letcher was an able campaigner who combined oratory and anecdotes to entertain and energize an audience. Breckinridge focused on issues in their first debate, comparing the Whig Tariff of 1842 to the Democrats' lower Walker tariff, which increased trade and yielded <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> revenue. Instead of answering Breckinridge's points, Letcher appealed to party loyalty, claiming Breckinridge would misrepresent the district [...] "because he is a Democrat". Letcher appealed to Whigs [...] "to protect the grave of Mr. [...] Clay from the impious tread of Democracy", but Breckinridge pointed to his friendly relations with Clay, remarking that Clay's will did not mandate that [...] "his ashes be exhumed" [...] and [...] "thrown into the scale to influence {{the result of the}} present Congressional contest".|$|E
500|$|I'm {{proud of}} my service to this country. If you love your country, you serve her. During a time of war, {{during a time of}} {{economic}} hardship, when asked to serve your country in a sensitive position where you can actually bring a background to help your nation, I'm the kind of person who's going to stand up and do it, and I'll take that philosophy to my grave... In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] And {{let me tell you what}} I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my record.|$|E
2500|$|The Laffer {{curve and}} supply-side {{economics}} inspired Reaganomics and the Kemp-Roth Tax Cut of 1981. Supply-side advocates {{of tax cuts}} claimed that lower tax rates would generate <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> revenue because the United States government's marginal income tax rates prior to the legislation were {{on the right-hand side}} of the curve. This assertion was derided by George H. W. Bush as [...] "voodoo economics" [...] while running against Reagan for the Presidential nomination in 1980. During the Reagan presidency, the top marginal rate of tax in the United States fell from 70% to 31%.|$|E

2500|$|The Hydropower Renewable Energy Development Act, {{sponsored}} by Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), sought to catalyze investment in hydropower by broadening its definition so more types of it qualify for Production Tax Credits {{and other types}} of government funding. [...] The bill also tried to redefine hydropower as a renewable energy source {{in the eyes of the}} federal government. [...] This would have made hydropower projects eligible for <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> credits that are currently only available for traditional renewable energy sources like solar and wind. [...] The Hydropower Renewable Energy Development Act was introduced too late during the 111th Congressional session and thus never reached the floor.|$|E
2500|$|Corbyn has campaigned against Private Finance Initiative (PFI) schemes; {{supported}} {{a higher rate}} of income tax for the wealthiest in society [...] and John McDonnell, his shadow chancellor, proposed the introduction of a £10 per hour living wage. He argues that many well off people are [...] "quite happy to pay <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> to fund better public services or to pay down our debt", and criticised then Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne for offering tax cuts for higher rate taxpayers. He opposes the idea the UK budget deficit should be reduced to meet an [...] "arbitrary deadline", but also said that Labour would not reintroduce a current budget deficit if budgets were balanced before 2020.|$|E
2500|$|On August 30, 2016, after {{a three-year}} {{investigation}} by the EU's competition commissioner that concluded that Apple received [...] "illegal state aid" [...] from Ireland, the EU ordered Apple to pay 13billion euros ($14.5billion), plus interest, in unpaid taxes. Specifically, the commissioner found that Apple had benefitted from Irish Department of Revenue tax rulings that allowed it to split the profits recorded by Apple Sales International internally between its Irish branch and a stateless [...] "head office" [...] entity lacking employees or premises (permitted under Irish law until 2013). The Chancellor of Austria, Christian Kern, put this decision into perspective by stating that [...] "every Viennese cafe, every sausage stand pays <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> in Austria than a multinational corporation".|$|E
40|$|Almost all the world's tax {{treaties}} {{are based}} on precedents found in an OECD model tax convention or a UN model tax convention. Both model divide taxing rights on cross-border investment and business activities. The OECD model shifts taxing rights to capital exporting treaty partners while the UN treaty allows capital importing countries to retain <b>more</b> <b>taxing</b> rights. This paper examines the use of OECD and UN precedents in the tax treaties {{of a group of}} 11 East African countries. It is difficult to see a link between reduced taxation by the capital importing countries and increased foreign investment. While there are variations within the group, as a group the African countries may have conceded <b>more</b> <b>taxing</b> rights to capital exporting nations than counterparts in Asia...|$|R
2500|$|On April 30, 2012, King {{published}} an article in The Daily Beast calling for rich Americans, including himself, to pay <b>more</b> <b>taxes,</b> citing it as [...] "a practical necessity and moral imperative {{that those who have}} received much should be obligated to pay ... in the same proportion".|$|R
50|$|The Six Nations Council {{continues}} to advocate that {{the millions of}} dollars paid by GRE to the federal government should be directly reinvested into the community since <b>more</b> <b>taxes</b> are paid by GRE compared to the annual transfer payment provided by Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada.|$|R
2500|$|A {{paper by}} economists Annette Alstadsæter, Niels Johannesen and Gabriel Zucman, which used data from HSBC Switzerland (“Swiss leaks”) and Mossack Fonseca (“Panama Papers”), found that [...] "on average about 3% of {{personal}} taxes are evaded in Scandinavia, but this figure rises to about 30% {{in the top}} 0.01% of the wealth distribution... Taking tax evasion into account increases the rise in inequality seen in tax data since the 1970s markedly, highlighting the need to move beyond tax data to capture income and wealth at the top, even in countries where tax compliance is generally high. We also find that after reducing tax evasion—by using tax amnesties—tax evaders do not legally avoid taxes more. This result suggests that fighting tax evasion {{can be an effective}} way to collect <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> revenue from the ultra-wealthy." ...|$|E
2500|$|United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ), a {{coalition}} of more than 1,300 international and U.S.-based organizations opposed to what they describe as [...] "our government's policy of permanent warfare and empire-building" [...] organized the March 19 actions. The events – involving up to 1000 people – took place throughout the downtown with protesters marching on 12th street to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building on Constitution Avenue declaring {{that they do not}} want any <b>more</b> <b>tax</b> money being used to wage war. Led, in part, by the War Resisters League and Code Pink, 31 people were arrested for crossing police lines at the IRS and blocking three entrances. [...] Demonstrators also gathered in front of institutions which profit from the war, such as the American Petroleum Institute – where they staged a sit-in blocking traffic – and at military recruitment offices. The protesters, including war veterans, demanded the arrests of President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as war criminals. Students for a Democratic Society protesters marched up and down K Street as part of their [...] "Funk the War" [...] protest to [...] "put on the map all the people who profited from the war". Other protesters hurled balloons full of red paint at a military recruiting station and smeared it on buildings of defense contractors Bechtel and Lockheed Martin. Many protesters marched to beating drums, and chanted, [...] "No blood for oil!" [...] Traffic in many areas was disrupted, and interruptions at the IRS were evident as workers inside were seen peering out windows at the protesters. At least thirty demonstrators were arrested around the IRS headquarters for crossing a police barricade. Two blocks from the Whitehouse, in McPherson Square, over two hundred protesters declared victory in shutting down traffic with some engaging the police while others chained their hands together inside school desks while demanding cuts in war spending and more money for education. [...] According to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report published in October 2007, the U.S. war in Iraq could cost taxpayers $1.9 trillion by 2017 when counting the huge interest costs because combat is being financed with borrowed money.|$|E
