50|$|There are two {{different}} ways to accomplish the emulation of a raster graphics. The first one {{is to create a}} low-resolution all-points-addressable mode using a set of special characters with all binary combinations of a certain subdivision matrix of the text mode character size; this method referred to as block graphics, or sometimes <b>mosaic</b> <b>graphics.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Prestel system, {{designed for}} cost effectiveness and simplicity, employed a rudimentary graphic capability known as serial mosaics. Through juxtaposition {{of the special}} mosaic characters, crude but recognizable graphic representations could {{be made on the}} screen. This graphic scheme had its limitations. To change colors between two mosaic graphic characters or between any two characters in general, a color change command was required. This command signal, however, physically occupied a blank space on the screen.The French sought to overcome this limitation when they joined the videotex world in the mid-1970s. They called their system Antiope. While based on the same <b>mosaic</b> <b>graphics</b> that were employed by the British, Antiope added a new feature, parallel attributes, or the ability to change the color from one cell to another without the need for a blank space.At approximately the same time, the Canadians adapted standard computer graphic commands into a set of functions called alphageometrics. These alphageometric functions did away with the block <b>mosaic</b> <b>graphics</b> used by the British and French and replaced them with drawing instructions, such as: DRAW LINE, DRAW ARC, DRAW POLYGON, etc. Through use of these geometric commands much higher resolution could be achieved than with the mosaic commands. This alphageometric scheme was integrated into the Canadian videotex system which the Canadians referred to as [...] "Telidon".|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, the European {{national}} Postal Telephone and Telegraph (PTT) {{agencies were}} also increasingly interested in videotex, and had convened discussions in European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) to co-ordinate developments, {{which had been}} diverging along national lines. As well as the British and French standards, the Swedes had proposed extending the British Prestel standard with {{a new set of}} smoother <b>mosaic</b> <b>graphics</b> characters; while the specification for the proposed German Bildschirmtext (BTX) system, developed under contract by IBM Germany for Deutsche Bundespost, was growing increasingly baroque. Originally conceived to follow the UK Prestel system, it had accreted elements from all the other European standards and more. This became the basis for setting out the CEPT recommendation T/CD 06-01, also proposed in May 1981. However, due to national pressure, CEPT stopped short of fixing a single standard, and instead recognised four [...] "profiles": CEPT1, corresponding to the German BTX; CEPT 2, the French Minitel; CEPT 3, the British Prestel; and CEPT 4, the Swedish Prestel Plus. National videotex services were encouraged to follow one of the existing four basic profiles; or if they extended them, to do so in ways compatible with a [...] "harmonised enhanced" [...] specification. There was talk of upgrading Prestel to the full CEPT standard [...] "within a couple of years". But in the event, it never happened. The German BTX eventually established CEPT1; the French Minitel continued with CEPT2, which was ready to roll out; and the British stayed with CEPT3, by now too established to break compatibility. The other countries of Europe adopted a patchwork of the different profiles.|$|E

50|$|The World Wide Web had {{a number}} of {{differences}} from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of link rot.Unlike predecessors such as HyperCard, the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due. Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the Gopher protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web. An early popular web browser was ViolaWWW for Unix and the X Windowing System.Scholars generally agree that a turning point for the World Wide Web began with the introduction of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, a graphical browser developed by a team at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (NCSA-UIUC), led by Marc Andreessen. Funding for Mosaic came from the U.S. High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative and the High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991, one of several computing developments initiated by U.S. Senator Al Gore. Prior to the release of <b>Mosaic,</b> <b>graphics</b> were not commonly mixed with text in web pages and the web's popularity was less than older protocols in use over the Internet, such as Gopher and Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS). Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become, by far, the most popular Internet protocol. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at INRIA (a French national computer research lab) with support from the European Commission DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at Keio University. By the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still relatively small, but many notable websites were already active that foreshadowed or inspired today's most popular services.|$|E
50|$|Trying to kick-start the market, AT&T Corporation {{entered the}} fray, and in May 1981 {{announced}} its own Presentation Layer Protocol (PLP). This was closely {{based on the}} Canadian Telidon system, but added to it some further graphics primitives and a syntax for defining macros, algorithms to define cleaner pixel spacing for the (arbitrarily sizeable) text, and also dynamically redefinable characters and a <b>mosaic</b> block <b>graphic</b> character set, {{so that it could}} reproduce content from the French Antiope. After some further revisions this was adopted in 1983 as ANSI standard X3.110, more commonly called NAPLPS, the North American Presentation Layer Protocol Syntax. It was also adopted in 1988 as the presentation-layer syntax for NABTS, the North American Broadcast Teletext Specification.|$|R

The colony was founded in 1957 by the {{archaeologist}} Prof. Boško Babić, but organized by the initiative of Prof. Babić and the academic painter Prof. Risto Lozanovski, making it perhaps one of the oldest colonies in southeastern Europe and the oldest one on the Balkans, for sure. It hosts painters and sculptors (working in marble, metal and wood) every year and, periodically, it hosts workshops and symposia for vitrage (glass design), <b>mosaics,</b> photography, <b>graphics</b> and clay, from countries around the world. The collection of sculptures carved in wood was acknowledged as a cultural heritage by the most relevant criticizers and opinion makers. 2007 was the 50th anniversary of the colony.|$|R
5000|$|Development of a French teletext-like system {{began in}} 1973. A very simple 2-way {{videotex}} system called Tictac was also {{demonstrated in the}} mid-1970s. As in the UK, this led on to work to develop a common display standard for videotex and teletext, called Antiope, which was finalised in 1977. Antiope had similar capabilities to the UK system for displaying alphanumeric text and chunky [...] "mosaic" [...] character-based block graphics. A difference however was that while in the UK standard control codes automatically also occupied one character position on screen, Antiope allowed for [...] "non spacing" [...] control codes. This allowed Antiope slightly more flexibility {{in the use of}} colours in <b>mosaic</b> block <b>graphics,</b> and in presenting the accents and diacritics of the French language.|$|R

Forty-eight general aviation pilots {{were divided into}} three equal groups and presented with a simulated flight scenario involving embedded convective activity. The control group had access to conventional sources of pre-flight and in-flight weather products. The two treatment groups were provided with a weather display that presented NEXRAD <b>mosaic</b> images, <b>graphic</b> depiction of METARs, and text METARs. One treatment group used a NEXRAD image looping feature and the second group used the National Convective Weather Forecast (NCWF) product overlaid on the NEXRAD display. Both of the treatment displays provided {{a significant increase in}} situation awareness but, they provided incomplete information required to deal with hazardous convective weather conditions, and would require substantial pilot training to permit their safe and effective use...|$|R
