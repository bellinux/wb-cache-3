With a matching ratio of about five, the <b>matched</b> <b>sample</b> reproduces the joint demographic distribution of the target population very closely. The sampling distribution of the associated state-level vote estimates is approximately standard normal with unit variance, suggesting little or no selection bias conditional upon a full set of demographic controls. The results are compared to RDD telephone and Internet samples, none of which are clearly better and some (such as the 2008 ANES Internet panel) are substantially worse.

30|$|Also, as {{mentioned}} in the Introduction, the second objective of the paper is to identify the mechanism {{that led to the}} housing bubble in Spain. In order to do this we are going to use the aforementioned <b>matched</b> <b>sample</b> which is a subsample of dwellings of the mortgage sample for which besides the individual and financial information we also have data on the transaction price and the characteristics of the dwelling provided by the real estate branch of the business group. In the third and fourth columns of Appendix Tables A. 1 and A. 2, we report the descriptive statistics of this <b>matched</b> <b>sample,</b> which contains 3, 305 observations. The most important thing to highlight is the similarity of the descriptive values in both the mortgage <b>sample</b> and the <b>matched</b> <b>sample.</b> Not only are the mean values from the financial variables very similar in both samples, but also the mean values of the individual characteristics. In this sense, the <b>matched</b> <b>sample</b> can be treated as a random subsample from the mortgage sample. The average transaction price (156, 005 €) is considerably lower than the appraisal value (195, 214 €). As a result, the appraisal to transaction price ratio is, for the whole period, 1.29. This fact may suggest an overappraising behavior by the financial institutions, issue which will be discussed in more detail in the next section.|$|R

The FBI, with superior resources was also searching for the typewriter, which the Hiss family had discarded some years earlier. Nevertheless, Schmahl was able to track it down first, and the Hiss defense introduced it {{with the intention of}} showing that its typeface would not be a match for that on the FBI's documents.

50|$|The {{estimation}} of SMCV relies on how samples are obtained in a study. When {{the groups are}} correlated, it is usually difficult to estimate the covariance among groups. In such a case, a good strategy is to obtain matched or paired samples (or subjects) and to conduct contrast analysis based on the <b>matched</b> <b>samples.</b> A simple example of matched contrast analysis is the analysis of paired difference of drug effects after and before taking a drug in the same patients. By contrast, another strategy is to not match or pair the samples and to conduct contrast analysis based on the unmatched or unpaired samples. A simple example of unmatched contrast analysis is the comparison of efficacy between a new drug taken by some patients and a standard drug taken by other patients. Methods of estimation for SMCV and c+-probability in matched contrast analysis may differ from those used in unmatched contrast analysis.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose and {{evaluate}} a new <b>matching</b> <b>sample</b> comparison method, the industry size peer matching method. Design/methodology/approach – Based on archival financial data from Compustat and econometric methods, the paper first validates that such a method will result in firms being divided into more homogenous groups, making peer-performance comparison more meaningful. Then it compares this new peer matching method with previous methods through two resource-based related studies in the IT valuation context. Findings – The results show that the industry size matching method is a better method because: it is theoretically grounded, addressing industry, size, and random shock effects and, at the same time, avoids the selection bias caused by using a single firm as benchmark; and empirically such a technique results in more homogeneous groups and can explain more firm-level returns than the industry-only classification. Originality/value – <b>Matched</b> <b>sample</b> comparison group analysis is widely used in both academy and industry. The paper's theoretically grounds and empirically validated <b>matching</b> <b>sample</b> comparison method provides researchers and practitioners with a tool for their future research, performance evaluation, earning management detection, or compensation contract design, when selecting the right peers is called for.
