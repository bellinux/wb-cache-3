50|$|The <b>managerial</b> <b>grid</b> model (1964) is a style {{leadership}} model {{developed by}} Robert R. Blake and Jane Mouton. This model originally identified five different leadership styles {{based on the}} concern for people and the concern for production.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{conflict}} style inventories {{have been in}} active use since the 1960s. Most of them {{are based on the}} <b>managerial</b> <b>grid</b> developed by Robert R. Blake and Jane Mouton in their <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid</b> Model. The Blake and Mouton model uses two axes: [...] "concern for people" [...] is plotted using the vertical axis and [...] "concern for task" [...] along the horizontal axis. Each axis has a numerical scale of 1 to 9. These axes interact so as to diagram five different styles of management. This grid posits the interaction of task with relationship and shows that according to how people value these, there are five basic ways of interacting with others.|$|E
50|$|The <b>managerial</b> <b>grid</b> {{model is}} {{also based on}} a {{behavioral}} theory. The model was developed by Robert Blake and Jane Mouton in 1964 and suggests five different leadership styles, based on the leaders' concern for people and their concern for goal achievement.|$|E
5000|$|Blake & Mouton <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid</b> (1964) - updated in 1991 to the Blake & McCanse Leadership Grid-developed the {{orientation}} of [...] "task orientation" [...] and [...] "people orientation" [...] in leader behavior. They developed the leadership grid which focused on concern for results (on the one axis) and concern for people (on the other axis).|$|E
50|$|The {{most widely}} used {{conflict}} style inventories {{are based on the}} Mouton Blake Axis which posits five styles of conflict response (see <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid</b> Model). These include the Jay Hall Conflict Management Survey, the Thomas Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument, a standard since the 1960s, and the Kraybill Conflict Style Inventory, a more recent publication that is culturally sensitive.|$|E
5000|$|FIRO-B {{would call}} the two {{dimensions}} Expressed Behavior and Wanted Behavior, and use three separate matrices for the respective areas of Inclusion (social skills) Control (leadership and responsibility-taking) and Affection (deep personal relationships). In 1977, [...] "locator charts" [...] were produced for each area by Dr. Leo Ryan, providing {{a map of the}} various scores, following the <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid</b> model, with unofficial names assigned to different score ranges. They were generally grouped into five main types for each area, in the vein of the <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid</b> and TKI, except that moderate scores (generally 4, 5) in only one dimension (with the other dimension being high or low) were given separate names, creating nine basic groups for each area (low e/w, low e/high w, low e/moderate w, etc.). In the control area, there is a tenth group created by a further division of the low e/high w range.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{addition}} to the two factor models {{was the creation of}} a 10 by 10 square grid developed by Robert R.

5000|$|Behavioral styles theory: Blake and Mouton, {{in their}} <b>managerial</b> <b>grid</b> model, {{proposed}} five leadership styles {{based on two}} axes - concern for the task versus concern for people. They suggested that the ideal is the [...] "team style", which balances concern for the task with concern for people. Scouller (2011) argued that this ideal approach may not suit all circumstances; for example, emergencies or turnarounds.|$|E
50|$|The content {{contained}} in the Boy Scouts of America youth leadership training program has evolved as the business world's model of leadership theory have evolved. In the 1960s, concepts of participatory leadership were evolving from trait-based leadership to transaction-based models. The former included Rensis Likert's System 4 leadership model and the latter Blake and Moulton's <b>Managerial</b> <b>grid</b> model. The Boy Scout's junior leader training program similarly evolved, adapting comparable principles from the White Stag program in the late 1960s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Managerial</b> <b>grid</b> {{models and}} matrix management, compromises between trueworkplace {{democracy}} and conventional top-down hierarchy, became {{common in the}} 1990s.These models cross responsibilities {{so that no one}} manager had total control of any one employee, or so that technical and marketing management were not subordinated to each other but had to argue out their concerns more mutually. A consequence of this was the rise of learning organization theory, in which the ontology of definitions in common among all factions or professions becomes the main management problem.|$|E
50|$|Servant {{leadership}} can be {{most likely}} {{associated with the}} participative leadership style. The authoritarian leadership style does not correspond to the guiding principle. The highest priority of a servant leader is to encourage, support and enable subordinates to unfold their full potential and abilities. This leads to an obligation to delegate responsibility and engage in participative decision-making. In the <b>managerial</b> <b>grid</b> model of Blake and Mouton, the participative style of leadership is presented as the approach with the greatest possible performance and employee satisfaction. However, {{there is the question}} whether a leadership style can be declared as universal and universally applicable. Situational contexts are not considered.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{addition}} to the two factor models {{was the creation of}} a 10 by 10 square grid developed by Robert R. Blake and Jane Mouton in their <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid</b> Model introduced in 1964. This matrix graded from 0 to 9, the factors of [...] "Concern for People" [...] and [...] "Concern for Production", allowing a moderate range of scores, which yielded five [...] "leadership styles". The Thomas Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI) used a version of this with [...] "Assertiveness" [...] and [...] "Cooperativeness" [...] as the two factors, and an intermediate score in both scales likewise resulting in a fifth mode directly {{in the center of the}} grid.|$|E
5000|$|Mouton was {{a former}} student of Robert Blake from the University of Texas. Together they are known for their {{creation}} of the aforementioned <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid</b> which was admittedly composed of Mouton’s creation and Blake’s name (Bokeno, 2007). The Grid came into existence when Blake and Mouton were hired as consultants by Exxon. It was during this time that their supposedly combined efforts produced the grid as a method of finding a median between McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y workers (Capstone, 2003). Originally, their work was reflected upon the National Training Laboratories (NTL) who they had worked with as a means of bringing their ideas into the organizations (Kleiner, 1996).|$|E
5000|$|FIRO-B {{was another}} such two-factor system, {{originally}} created by Dr. Schutz in 1958, {{using the same}} scales corresponding to extroversion/introversion and people/task focus. The difference now {{was that there were}} three such matrices. These three areas of interaction are Inclusion, Control, and Affection. Note that these areas include the two familiar scales: how you want to relate to others (called [...] "expressed behavior"), and how you want them to relate to you (called [...] "wanted behavior"). Scores in these scales range from 0 to 9. In 1977, [...] "locator charts" [...] were produced for each area by Leo Ryan, providing a map of the various scores, following the <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid</b> model; with unofficial names assigned to different score ranges.|$|E
50|$|Mouton {{was among}} the few women to lead one of the NTL’s T-Groups (Training Groups) during the 1950s. However, Blake and Mouton’s {{methodology}} was more focused on treating the organizational issues rather than simply diagnosing them. This was contrary to standard NTL practices. Thus, they separated from the company. Blake had copyrighted the Grid so that only by franchising with him could someone else use the Grid for training, thus ensuring that everyone would use {{it in the way}} Blake and Mouton deemed fitting. Therefore, through their work with NTL leading T-Group’s and the creation of Mouton’s <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid,</b> Blake became famous and Mouton was seemingly allowed to ride on his coat tails, eventually co-founding Scientific Methods, Inc. in 1961 (Ultimate, 2003).|$|E
50|$|Conflict style {{inventories}} {{are most}} often used in leadership and management training courses or in executive coaching sessions.Conflict style inventories, which {{first appeared in the}} 1960s, were most often {{based on the work of}} Robert R. Blake and Jane Mouton using their <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid</b> Model. Blake and Mouton used two axes. “Concern for people” is plotted on the Y axis and “Concern for task” is plotted on axis X. Using this group they developed five differing styles of approaching conflict resolution often referenced as: win-win, win-lose, compromise, avoid, and comply. In 1974, Kenneth W. Thomas and Ralph H. Kilman adopted this model and created the Thomas Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument. This is the best known of the conflict style inventories. Another often used instrument is the Conflict Dynamics Profile offered by Eckerd College in Florida. This is primarily designed to be offered as a 360 degree instrument.|$|E
50|$|In 1948, Stogdill {{stated that}} {{leadership}} exists between persons {{in a social}} situation, and that persons who are leaders in one situation {{may not necessarily be}} leaders in other situations. This statement has been cited ubiquitously as sounding the death knell for trait-leadership theory. Furthermore, scholars commented that any trait's effect on leadership behavior will always depend on the situation (Huges, Ginnett, & Curphy, 1996; Yukl & Van Fleet, 1992). Subsequently, leadership stopped being characterized by individual differences, and behavioral and situational analyses of leadership took over and began to dominate the field of leadership research (Bass, 1990). During this period of widespread rejection, several dominant theories took the place of trait leadership theory, including Fiedler's (1967) contingency model, Blake and Mouton's (1964) <b>managerial</b> <b>grid,</b> Hersey and Blanchard's (1969) situational leadership model, and transformational and transactional leadership models (Avolio, Sosik, Jung, & Berson, 2003; Bass, 1985; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, & Fetter, 1990).|$|E
5000|$|In 1957, Robert Tannenbaum and Richard Schmidt {{developed}} a leadership continuum with relationship orientation characterized by high employee freedom on one extreme and task oriented behavior characterized by high use of leader authority {{at the other}} extreme. According to this model, as a leader became more relationship oriented, he became less task oriented. In 1964 Fred Fiedler published the Fiedler Contingency Model of leadership that recognized that the style of leadership that was most effective depended upon {{the context in which}} the style was applied. Leadership behavior was modeled as a continuum between Fiedler defined styles as either task motivated or relationship motivated and {{developed a}} scale to classify leaders into one of these styles. He considered the state of the relationships in the work place, the degree of structure in the task, and strength of the positional power of the leadership position in recommending a style of leader for a position. This model Fiedler saw leadership style as an inherent characteristic of a particular leader and a single style consistently applied in a particular leadership position. Robert R. Blake and Jane S. Mouton developed the <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid</b> Model in 1964. The grid was formed by strength in two variables: concern for people and concern for production. They related these variables with five leadership styles:Some researchers looked for evidence that team leadership or “high-high” leadership was superior in all situations. However, the research was inconclusive.In 1969 Paul Hersey and Ken Blanchard published Management of Organizational Behavior: Using human resources detailing their situational leadership theory. This theory was unique in bringing these concepts together: ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} the management style at Durban Mill {{and the corresponding}} climate it created. The first objective was to establish the current style of management using the <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid</b> Theory developed by Robert Blake and Jane Mouton in 1964. Blake and Mouton's <b>Managerial</b> <b>grid</b> (1975) identified five different styles of management, each differentiated by the degree of concern for people and degree of concern for production. According to Blake and Mouton (1975) the Team Leader (9, 9) style of management is effective most of the time, however, one must not dismiss the other styles as depicted on the <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid</b> (see Figure 2. 1), as depending on the situation {{they may be the}} most appropriate style to use. The second objective was to identi fy the impact of this style of management on the psychological climate in the company i. e. the atmosphere in the workplace. The model used in this study to measure psychological climate was based on a study conducted by MCG Davidson (2000). Davidson's model, in itself was an adaptation of studies conducted by. lames and. Iones (1979) and Ryder and Southey (1989). The dimensions of climate identified for this study was, Leadership Facilitation and Support; Professional Organisational Esprit; Conflict and Amhiguity: Regulations and Organisation Pressure: Joh Challenge. Importance and Variety and Workgroup Co-operatioll. Frielldlilless alld Warmth. This research hypothesised that the dominant style of management in the mill is Impoverished Leader (i. e. Iow concern for people and low concern for production). Further, this style of management influences each dimension of climate as identified above. The results indicated, the two dominant management styles in the company was Team leader and Impoverished leader. According to Blake and Mouton's (1975) theory, whilst the fom 1 er result is positive, the latter is a less than desired style for any company to operate in. The findings in the climate section of this study revealed that there is seldom to occasionally a positive climate in the workplace regarding, leadership support and facilitation, company image, issues relating to conflict and ambiguity, regulations and job pressure and job challenge. The correlation analysis showed that management style and organisational climate are strongly related (r= 0. 786), variables. Management style is related to the following dimensions of climate vi z. leadership facilitation and support of employees, professional organisational esprit, con flict and ambiguity and regulations and job pressure. Poor support was found for the relationship between management style and job variety and importance and no relationship found between management style and workgroup friendliness and support. In order to improve relations between management and employees and thus contribute towards business success, a holistic approach was taken in the recommended strategy. A reengineering of the business towards a leaming organisation based Tobin's (993) theory was suggested. Tobin 's theory on "Ieaming organisations," is characterised by five foundations VI Z. visible leadership, ' thinking' literacy, overcoming functional myopia, ' Ieaming' teams and managers as enablers.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine how leadership competencies are remembered and utilized following instruction in a structured collegiate leadership course. The population for this study consisted of experienced collegiate leaders who competed an academic leadership course. The purposive sample included seventy-four students who competed the course during a semester within a three year period. For this longitudinal study, the investigator used a web-based survey. A three-part instrument was used. The first section focused on the comprehension and use of leadership competencies presented in the leadership course. These competencies included: Trait Theory, Theory X/Theory Y, Task v Relationship, Blake and Mouton's <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid,</b> Motivation, Image, Situational Leadership, Delegation, Teams, Tuckman's Team Development Model, Vision, Power, Transactional/ Transformational Leadership, and Consensus. The second section was the Leadership Skills Inventory (LSI). The LSI consisted of twenty-one statements describing various leadership and life skills. These statements corresponded to five internal scales used for analysis: working with others, decision-making, positional leadership, understanding of self, and communication. The final section of the instrument covered demographics that included gender, year the course was taken, number of collegiate activities, number of leadership courses taken, hours spent per week in student activities, and perceived level of involvement. Comparisons were made between the different classes in regards to self-perceived leadership competency knowledge (retained comprehension) as well as self-perceived leader competency use. Results showed statistically significant differences were found among students one, two, and three years after the course and self-perceived knowledge of Task v Relationship and Blake and Mouton's <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid.</b> Findings also showed that there was no statistically significant difference between self-perceived leadership competency use and the number of years post collegiate leadership course.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{substantive}} {{increase in the number}} of candidates enrolled in Ph. D research programs in the past decade. Whereas the literature is relatively substantial and informative regarding advice to candidates and supervisors in many areas there is little evidence of research related to supervisory styles and changes of style over the supervisory period. This paper attempts to close that research gap by examining 60 items of literature related to Ph. D completion. Eighty key variables were extracted from the literature and were used to build a four-quadrant supervisory style management grid based on the Blake and Moulton <b>Managerial</b> <b>Grid</b> model. The grid was subject to a verification study through the results obtained from 12 in-depth interviews with supervisors. Further, a hypothetical model was developed to examine changes in supervisory style over time along with the managerial implications for supervisors.
