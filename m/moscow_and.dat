5|$|In early November 2007, Athens, Bangkok, Singapore, <b>Moscow,</b> <b>and</b> Turin were {{selected}} by the IOC as the five candidate cities to host the inaugural Youth Olympic Games. In January 2008, the candidates were further pared down to just <b>Moscow</b> <b>and</b> Singapore. Finally, on 21 February 2008, Singapore was declared host of the inaugural Youth Olympic Games 2010 via live telecast from Lausanne, Switzerland, winning by a tally of 53 votes to 44 for Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund III {{subsequently}} {{rejected the}} compromise solution and demanded the tsar's throne for himself, {{which would mean}} complete subjugation of Russia, and as such {{was rejected by the}} bulk of the Russian society. Sigismund's refusal and demands only intensified the chaos, as the Swedes proposed their own candidate and took over Veliki Novgorod. The result of this situation and of the ruthless Commonwealth occupation in <b>Moscow</b> <b>and</b> elsewhere in Russia was the 1611 popular Russian anti-Polish uprising, heavy fighting in <b>Moscow</b> <b>and</b> a siege of the Polish garrison occupying the Kremlin.|$|E

5|$|The major {{economic}} centres are Moscow, Minsk and Astana. The distance between <b>Moscow</b> <b>and</b> Minsk is 717 kilometers, {{and the distance}} between <b>Moscow</b> <b>and</b> Astana is 2700 kilometers, making infrastructure a key challenge for the integration of member states. Major infrastructure projects began during the 2000s in order to modernise and connect the regional bloc to other markets, facilitating both integration and trade in the region. In 2007 Moscow announced it will invest 1 trillion USD by 2020 to modernise the country's infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Although Kennan {{regarded}} the Soviet Union as {{too weak to}} risk war, he nonetheless considered it an enemy capable of expanding into Western Europe through subversion, given the popular support for Communist parties in Western Europe, which remained demoralized by the devastation of the Second World War. To counter this potential source of Soviet influence, Kennan's solution was to direct economic aid and covert political help to Japan and Western Europe to revive Western governments and assist international capitalism; by doing so the United States would help to rebuild the balance of power. In June 1948, Kennan proposed covert assistance to left-wing parties not oriented toward <b>Moscow</b> <b>and</b> to labor unions in Western Europe in order to engineer a rift between <b>Moscow</b> <b>and</b> working-class movements in Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Amasova examine Stromberg's {{underwater}} Atlantis {{base from}} an American submarine, and confirm {{that he is}} operating the stolen tracking system. The Liparus captures the submarine. Stromberg sets his plan in motion: the simultaneous launching of nuclear missiles from British and Soviet submarines to destroy <b>Moscow</b> <b>and</b> New York City. This would trigger a global nuclear war, which Stromberg would survive in Atlantis, and subsequently a new civilisation would be established underwater. He leaves for Atlantis with Amasova. Bond escapes and frees the captured British, Russian and American sailors and they battle the Liparuss crew. Bond reprograms the submarines to fire missiles at each other, saving <b>Moscow</b> <b>and</b> New York City. The victorious submariners escape the sinking Liparus on the American submarine.|$|E

25|$|Montferrand's name is {{associated}} with St. Petersburg. However, working with Betancourt, he also designed buildings in <b>Moscow,</b> Odessa, <b>and</b> Nizhny Novgorod.

5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to ensure their readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to <b>Moscow</b> <b>and</b> their wings could not be dismounted which meant that they could not be railed to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} 20 rather amateurish artistic {{photography}} events arranged by Aage Remfeldt between 1946 and 1976 at Charlottenborg, Denmark had few photographic exhibitions until the 1960s. The situation improved in 1963 when Jesper Høm arranged an {{exhibition at the}} Danish Museum of Art & Design with photographers from New York City, <b>Moscow</b> <b>and</b> Paris. Another positive influence was Keld Helmer-Petersen's book Fragments of a City with photographs of fire escapes and artistically silhouetted cranes taken {{while he was a}} student at Chicago's Institute of Design, some of which were published in the magazine Perspectiv.|$|E
