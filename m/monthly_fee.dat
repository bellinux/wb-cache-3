5|$|In April 1993, Sega {{announced}} the Sega Channel service, which would utilize cable television services to deliver content. National {{testing in the}} United States for the service began in June, and deployment across the United States began in December, with a complete U.S. release in 1994. By June 1994, Sega Channel had gained a total of 21 cable companies signed up to carry the service. Fees in the United States for the service varied depending on location, but were approximately US$15 monthly, plus a $25 activation fee, which included the adapter. The Sega Channel expanded into Canada in late 1995, with an approximately Can$19 <b>monthly</b> <b>fee.</b> During the planning stages of the service, Sega looked {{to capitalize on the}} rental market, which had seen some success with the Sega CD being rented through Blockbuster, Inc., and was looking to base the service's offering of games and demos to help sell more cartridges.|$|E
5|$|The station also {{includes}} a 600-stall park and ride lot next to the bus station and an auxiliary lot located across Southcenter Boulevard. The park and ride, initially the only facility on Central Link, would regularly fill before 9:00a.m. by 2013, leading to complaints and commuters parking on nearby residential streets. An additional 62 parking spaces were added in November 2013, through a lease from a private garage owned by the City of SeaTac. The opening of the University Link in 2016 worsened the parking issue, leaving the lot filled by 6:40a.m. Sound Transit began a permit parking trial in September 2016 that reserves spaces for registered carpool vehicles for a <b>monthly</b> <b>fee</b> of $5, {{in an effort to}} alleviate the parking problems at the station. A second park and ride opened at Angle Lake station in September 2016, which was expected to relieve the Tukwila lot, but demand remained the same while Angle Lake's lot filled with new commuters. Sound Transit also offers a bicycle parking station with eight secured spots, as well as racks for temporary use.|$|E

25|$|Taxicab {{companies}} may be independently owned small businesses {{with only one}} taxicab and driver or have fleets of 100 or more taxicabs. Drivers are rarely employees of the company, and usually lease the taxicab on a per-shift basis. Cabs can also be owned by separately-incorporated small businesses that subscribe to a dispatch service. The owner/driver will pay a <b>monthly</b> <b>fee</b> to the taxicab company; purchase and maintain his own vehicle, and may in turn lease shifts to other drivers.|$|E

25|$|Bundled service (non-taxable):Bundled {{service is}} local and long {{distance}} service provided under {{a plan that}} does not separately state the charge for the local telephone service. Bundled service includes, for example, Voice over Internet Protocol service, prepaid telephone cards, and plans that provide both local and long distance service for either a flat <b>monthly</b> <b>fee</b> or a charge that varies with the elapsed transmission time for which the service is used. Telecommunications companies provide bundled service for both landline and wireless (cellular) service.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of launch, the access prices for RSPs were {{temporarily}} set at a flat rate of A$300 per premises with no ongoing monthly charges. Mike Quigley {{said one of the}} reasons for the flat rate is the OSS and BSS systems was not built to make the process automatic. He continued if NBN Co charged a monthly charge without the systems, it would have been a 'very manually intensive process' and not a 'sensible proposition'. However, RSPs did charge a <b>monthly</b> <b>fee</b> to customers, to cover the cost of the trial.|$|E
25|$|Pandora's cost {{structure}} is highly variable, with content acquisition costs representing roughly 50% of total costs. There are three main {{costs associated with}} content acquisition. First, SoundExchange collects content fees on behalf of labels or artists on the recording themselves. These {{are by far the}} largest content acquisition costs. Second, Pandora pays licensing fees to agencies such as BMI, ASCAP, or SESAC in order to compensate composers, songwriters and publishers. Lastly, Pandora also pays Rovi for song and artist information; this has recently been structured as a flat <b>monthly</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|E

25|$|In July 2014, the MBTA {{announced}} that a private company would be building a new $5.6 million network to replace the 2008-built network. The MBTA is not paying for the new network; instead, the company expects to recoup its investment by providing a two-tiered offering. Free limited-bandwidth wi-fi {{will continue to be}} provided, along with local television broadcasts; a <b>monthly</b> <b>fee</b> will be charged by the company for access to higher bandwidth and other broadcasts, with 7.5% of the fee returned to the MBTA.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{above-ground}} groups exist to support covert volunteers. The Animal Liberation Front Supporters Group (ALF SG) adopts activists in jail as prisoners of conscience; anyone {{can join the}} ALFSG for a small <b>monthly</b> <b>fee.</b> The Vegan Prisoners Support Group, created in 1994 when British activist Keith Mann was first jailed, works with prison authorities in the UK to ensure that ALF prisoners have access to vegan supplies. The Animal Liberation Press Office receives and publicizes anonymous communiqués from volunteers; it operates as an ostensibly independent group funded by public donations, though the High Court in London ruled in 2006 that its press officer in the UK, Robin Webb, was a pivotal figure in the ALF.|$|E
5000|$|Often TV pirates will hack a TV subscription-service provider's {{smart cards}} and {{reprogram}} {{them with an}} autoroll for all the subscription service's channels. Though providers like DIRECTV and DISH Network have attempted to use weekly ECMs, or [...] "electronic countermeasures," [...] to disrupt these illegal cards, many websites provide updated autoroll codes impervious to ECMs and offer this software for a <b>monthly</b> subscription <b>fee</b> less than the service provider's <b>monthly</b> <b>fees.</b>|$|R

25|$|The housing {{cooperative}} {{is a special}} legal entity, regulated in Swedish law. It has the same obligations of bookkeeping and issuing annual reports as companies and it can take mortgages in the property if needed. In addition, each member may also take mortgages in his bostadsrätt in order to finance his acquisition of it. The <b>monthly</b> <b>fee</b> paid by the members to the cooperative is intended to cover the operational and financial expenditures of the cooperative. The financial situation of the Swedish cooperatives vary a lot, and on rare occasions cooperatives may go bankrupt. If bankruptcy occurs, the property is sold and the remaining assets are shifted out to the members (who may stay on as tenants or try {{to form a new}} cooperative).|$|E
25|$|Some taxicab {{companies}} are independently owned small businesses {{with only one}} taxicab and driver, but many cab companies have fleets of 100 or more taxicabs. Drivers are rarely employees of the company, and usually lease the taxicab on a per-shift basis. Lease drivers receive no benefits from the taxicab company, and often have to bribe dispatchers to get a shift. However, in some cases, cabs can also be owned by separately-incorporated small businesses that subscribe to a dispatch service, {{in which case the}} company logo on the door is that of the dispatch association.

25|$|Peñabots is {{the name}} given to what analysts believe to be a network of {{automated}} accounts on social media used by the Mexican government to spread pro-government propaganda and to marginalize dissenting opinions in social media, the bots were first noticed in the 2012 elections when {{they were used to}} disseminate opinions in support of Enrique Peña Nieto in social networks. According to Aristegui Noticias, their usage goes against articles 6 and 134 of the Mexican Constitution, the ones used by the current government cost an estimated 80 million pesos <b>monthly</b> <b>fee,</b> which is paid with money extracted form the citizens taxes. Facebook currently holds approximately 640,321 Peñabots, while Twitter requires less. As of July 2017, Oxford University’s Computational Propaganda Research Project claimed Mexico's social media manipulation to come directly from the Mexican Government itself.|$|E

50|$|Example: A {{merchant}} {{has signed}} a contract with a $25.00 <b>monthly</b> minimum <b>fee.</b> If all the fees (clarity: this is only for processing costs, so it does not include <b>monthly</b> <b>fees,</b> chargeback fees, etc.) for the most recent month of processing total only $15.00, this merchant will be charged an additional $10.00 to meet their monthly minimum requirements. Sometimes there are fees that are charged that are {{not a part of the}} monthly minimum, such as statement fees. It is industry standard to charge a monthly minimum, though not all acquirers charge this, nor do all that do charge it for every agreement.|$|R
25|$|Brian {{was under}} Landy's care for {{fourteen}} months until December 1976, when the therapist was dismissed for a dispute on his <b>monthly</b> <b>fee.</b> Throughout {{the next several}} years, Brian vacillated between periods of relative stability and resurgences of his food and drug addictions. He repeatedly checked {{in and out of}} hospitals, and continued behaving erratically, plagued by incessant mood swings. At one point, he wandered off alone for several days and was sighted at a gay bar playing piano for drinks; living as a vagrant in Balboa Park, San Diego until officers took him to Alvarado Hospital for alcohol poisoning. Brian's role in the band, as well as the Beach Boys' commercial prospects, began to diminish once more. By 1982, Brian was immersed in debt, owing the government {{tens of thousands of dollars}} in back taxes.|$|E
25|$|This {{also gave}} rise to a new class of BBS systems, {{dedicated}} solely to file upload and downloads. These systems charged for access, typically a flat <b>monthly</b> <b>fee,</b> compared to the per-hour fees charged by Event Horizons BBS and most online services. A host of 3rd party services sprang up to support these systems, offering simple credit card merchant account gateways for the payment of monthly fees, and entire file libraries on compact disk that made initial setup very easy. Early 1990s editions of Boardwatch were filled with ads for single-click install solutions dedicated to these new sysops. While this gave the market a bad reputation, it also led to its greatest success; during the early 1990s, {{there were a number of}} mid-sized software companies dedicated to BBS software, and the number of BBSes in service reached its peak.|$|E
25|$|When Home Box Office (HBO) began {{scrambling}} its signal on a 24-hour {{basis on}} January 15, 1986, it offered subscriptions to home dish owners for $12.95 per month ($28.92 in 2017 dollars), which was either {{equal to or}} slightly higher than what cable subscribers paid. HBO also advised viewers that purchasing a descrambler for $395 ($882.21 in 2017 dollars) would (along with the <b>monthly</b> <b>fee)</b> allow them to continue watching HBO. Several satellite dish dealers across the United States closed their stores {{as a result of}} a reduction in dish sales, caused by the rise in signal scrambling. Satellite dish owners began protests over scrambling, saying that clear signals from cable channels would become difficult to receive. One such protest was by members of the Satellite Television Industry Association, who converged on Washington, D.C., in March 1986 to urge the United States Congress to protect access to satellite transmissions.|$|E
