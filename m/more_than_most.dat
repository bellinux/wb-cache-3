While he {{received an}} expense allowance of over $75,000, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> senators received (because California {{was one of the}} most populous states), that money went to pay his staff of 12 and to cover the cost of stationery, telephone service, telegrams, and other office expenses. It also paid for the one set of round-trip airline tickets between Washington, D.C., and California that Nixon was allowed to buy for himself and his family at taxpayer expense each Congressional session.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{entering}} the crisis {{with a low}} level of public debtroughly 40% of GDPand a moderate deficit compared to many European nations, the UK's ability to take discretionary fiscal action was limited by the burden of bank bail-outs on public finances. The tax revenue from financial services, which was conservatively estimated at 13.9% of UK tax income in 2007, fell alarmingly as the crisis affected bank profits. This contributed to a significant rise in the deficit to an estimated £175billion (12.4% of GDP) in 2009–10 and a rise in the national debt to above 80% of GDP at its peak. The UK had significant automatic stabilisers which contributed far more than discretionary action and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> other countries.|$|E
5|$|Harrison was memorialized {{on several}} postage stamps. The {{first was a}} 13-cent stamp issued on November 18, 1902, with the {{engraved}} likeness of Harrison modeled after a photo provided by his widow. In all Harrison has been honored on six U.S. Postage stamps, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> other U.S. Presidents. Harrison also was featured on the five-dollar National Bank Notes from the third charter period, beginning in 1902. In 2012, a dollar coin with his image, part of the Presidential $1 Coin Program, was issued.|$|E

5|$|Since Nintendo did {{not have}} many products, it made only a few {{commercials}} a year, meaning the quality had to be phenomenal. The budget for a single commercial could reach US $5 million, easily {{four or five times}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> companies spent. One of the first commercials made under Bill White, director of advertising and public relations, was the market introduction for the Legend of Zelda, which received {{a great deal of attention}} in the ad industry. In it, a wiry-haired, nerdy guy (John Kassir) walks through the dark making goofy noises, yelling out the names of some enemies from the game, and screaming for Zelda.|$|E
5|$|The loss of so {{many young}} men during the Second World War made it {{difficult}} for clubs to retain their former status. This was especially true for Millwall, who appeared to suffer <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>most.</b> From being one of the country's biggest clubs before the war, Millwall were reduced to one of its smallest afterward. The Den sustained severe bomb damage on 19 April 1943, and one week later a fire, determined to have been caused by a discarded cigarette, also destroyed an entire stand. The club accepted offers from neighbours Charlton Athletic, Crystal Palace and West Ham United to stage games at their grounds. On 24 February 1944, Millwall returned to The Den, to play in an all-standing stadium. This was achieved with considerable volunteer labour by Lions fans. One of the biggest Cup upsets came in the fourth round of the 1956–57 FA Cup on 26 January 1957, when Millwall beat Newcastle United 2–1 in front of a crowd of 45,646. At the time the club was fighting for Third Division survival.|$|E

In the course of subduing the Shewans, Tewodros imprisoned a Shewan prince, Menelik II, who would later become emperor himself.

25|$|Another {{piece of}} {{evidence}} suggesting that some stegosaurids may have consumed more than just low vegetation was {{the discovery of the}} long-necked stegosaurid Miragaia longicollum.

However, the publication of Dune did open doors for him. He was the Seattle Post-Intelligencer's education writer from 1969 to 1972 and lecturer in general studies and interdisciplinary studies at the University of Washington (1970–1972). He worked in Vietnam and Pakistan as social and ecological consultant in 1972. In 1973 he was director-photographer of the television show The Tillers.|$|E

The first Webster postage stamp, bearing only Webster's portrait, was not issued until April 12 of 1870, 18 years after his death.

25|$|In photon therapy, {{most of the}} {{radiation}} effect is through free radicals. Cells have mechanisms for repairing single-strand DNA damage and double-stranded DNA damage. However, double-stranded DNA breaks are {{much more difficult to}} repair, and can lead to dramatic chromosomal abnormalities and genetic deletions. Targeting double-stranded breaks increases the probability that cells will undergo cell death. Cancer cells are generally less differentiated and more stem cell-like; they reproduce <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> healthy differentiated cells, and have a diminished ability to repair sub-lethal damage. Single-strand DNA damage is then passed on through cell division; damage to the cancer cells' DNA accumulates, causing them to die or reproduce more slowly.|$|E

Upon his return to academia in 1947, he found himself passed over for promotion above associate professor.

25|$|Nationalists deplore {{the fact}} that so many people are {{stateless}} or live under inefficient and tyrannical regimes. Advocates of the society of states are concerned about rogue states and about the imperial ambitions of the powerful. Cosmopolitans believe that the contemporary world badly fails to live up to their standards, and that doing so would require considerable changes in the actions of wealthy individuals and states. It might, for instance, require them to transfer most of their wealth to the poor. It might require the building of international institutions able to limit, or even replace, the self-interested action of powerful states and corporations. It might require each of us to do much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> now do.|$|E
25|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II, the War Department took over the Stadium in 1940, where for a while POWs (Prisoners of War) were housed in huts placed on the pitch, for this the club received compensation of £4,570 in 1945. World War II affected Swindon Town <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> other football clubs and the club was almost disbanded, the club needed {{a large amount of}} time to recover and for this reason it failed to make any real impression in the league and would not climb into the second division until 1963 when they finished runners up to Northampton Town.
