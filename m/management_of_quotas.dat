40|$|The trophy {{hunting of}} lions Panthera leo is {{contentious}} due to uncertainty concerning conservation impacts {{and because of}} highly polarised opinions about the practice. African lions are hunted across at least ~ 558, 000 km(2), which comprises 27 - 32 % of the lion range in countries where trophy hunting of the species is permitted. Consequently, trophy hunting has potential to impart significant positive or negative impacts on lions. Several {{studies have demonstrated that}} excessive trophy harvests have driven lion population declines. There have been several attempts by protectionist non-governmental organisations to reduce or preclude trophy hunting via restrictions on the import and export of lion trophies. We document the management of lion hunting in Africa and highlight challenges which need addressing to achieve sustainability. Problems include: unscientific bases for quota setting; excessive quotas and off-takes in some countries; fixed quotas which encourage over-harvest; and lack of restrictions on the age of lions that can be hunted. Key interventions needed to make lion hunting more sustainable, include implementation of: enforced age restrictions; improved trophy monitoring; adaptive <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> and a minimum length of lion hunts of at least 21 days. Some range states have made important steps towards implementing such improved management and off-takes have fallen steeply in recent years. For example age restrictions have been introduced in Tanzania and in Niassa in Mozambique, and are being considered for Benin and Zimbabwe, several states have reduced quotas, and Zimbabwe is implementing trophy monitoring. However, further reforms are needed to ensure sustainability and reduce conservation problems associated with the practice while allowing retention of associated financial incentives for conservation...|$|E

40|$|There is a firm {{relationship}} between agricultural and consumer prices, which is intuitively expected {{as well as}} supported by statistical analyses. This relationship is positive when examined through cross-correlations. VAR analysis also suggests that rises in agricultural prices will reflect on the food prices and the consumer prices, in a statistically significant manner. Based on these assessments, food prices could adversely affect the Turkish inflation process. Due {{to the fact that}} instability in food prices mainly stems from the performance of the agricultural sector and the related seasonal production patterns, the importance <b>of</b> the supply <b>management</b> <b>of</b> agricultural and food products can be highlighted. Consequently, this study examines the possible changes in the current import regime about agricultural and food products regarding their impacts on inflation.

The published article is copyrighted by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. and can be found at: [URL] quota (IQ) management systems in commercial marine fisheries are highly diverse, differing in the security, durability and exclusivity of the harvesting privilege and the transferability <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> units. This diversity in the degree of harvest rights may influence the effectiveness of IQ fisheries to meet management objectives. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 167 stocks managed under IQs to test whether the strength of harvest rights impacts the conservation status of stocks in terms of catch, exploitation rate and biomass relative to management targets. We used non-parametric methods to assess non-linear relationships and linear regression models to explicitly consider interactions among predictors. Most IQ fisheries consistently met fleet-wide quota limits (94 % of stocks had recent catches below or within 10 % <b>of</b> <b>quotas),</b> but only 2 / 3 of IQ fisheries adhered to sustainable management targets for biomass and exploitation rate (68 % of stocks had exploitation rates below or within 10 % of targets and 63 % of stocks had biomass above or within 10 % of biomass targets). Strikingly, when exclusivity of the harvesting privilege was low, exploitation rates depended on whether IQ implementation was industry-driven (exploitation below targets) or government-mandated (exploitation above targets). At high levels of exclusivity, exploitation rates converged to just below <b>management</b> targets. Transferability <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> units was associated with stock biomass closer to and slightly above target levels than stocks with non-transferable quota. However, regional differences had the strongest effect on biomass, suggesting that other management or biological attributes of regional fishery systems have greater influence on marine populations...|$|R

40|$|The California Department of Fish and Game has {{conducted}} periodic studies on Pacific herring since 1953. This report {{concentrates on the}} period from 1972 through 1980 during which the herring fishery underwent a dramatic resurgence due {{to the opening of}} a lucrative market for herring roe in Japan. The spawning biomass of Pacific herring was estimated by determining numbers of eggs spawned and using previously derived estimates of eggs per gram of fish to convert this figure to short tons of herring. Spawning biomass estimates for Tomales Bay ranged from 4, 728 tons in the 1974 – 75 season to 22, 163 tons in the 1977 – 78 season. Estimates for San Francisco Bay ranged from 6, 179 tons in 1973 – 74 season to 52, 869 tons in the 1979 – 80 season. Sampling the roe fishery catch in Tomales and San Francisco Bays revealed that age 2 and 3 herring dominated the round haul fishery, and ages 5 and 6 dominated the gill net fishery. Gill nets consistently caught larger herring and a higher percentage of females than round haul nets. Comparison of length at age of herring from Tomales and San Francisco Bays revealed a statistical difference in growth rates between populations of the two bays. Tomales Bay herring are larger at a given age than San Francisco Bay herring. Spawning time was related to the tidal cycle in San Francisco Bay. From 1973 through 1976, 88 % of all spawnings occurred when the daily high tide was at night.

40|$|Research PaperUntil {{recently}} the execution <b>of</b> the fisheries <b>management</b> schemes in the Netherlands {{was to a}} large extend centralized. In 1993, however, part of the executionary responsibilities was delegated to the fishing industry. In this new system, responsibilities in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> individual transferable <b>quota</b> (ITQs) has been devolved to groups of fishermen. This Dutch co-management system proved {{to be successful in}} quota management; landings did not exceed quota in the period 1993 - 2001. A 1996 evaluation of the system concluded that the combination of positive inducements and some coercion made individual fishermen decide to become and to remain cooperative; that the fleet succeeded in a more economic use of the quota; and, that the distribution of net benefits had improved to some extent. Both fishermen and government are enthusiastic about the management system. Since January 2002 a Steering group has started to investigate the possibilities to extend the <b>management</b> responsibilities <b>of</b> the fishermen’s groups.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 The {{relationship}} between intrinsic fish quality (fish condition before handling), production efficiency, product price, and the optimal <b>management</b> <b>of</b> commercial "wild" fisheries was explored in four companion papers. The optimal <b>management</b> plan-consisting <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> and harvest schedules - would maximize the discounted net industry revenues (NPV) given a minimum biomass level. The first paper used information on biological changes in Pacific whiting and corresponding production yields to model a vertically integrated fishery from harvest through processing. The seasonal, nonlinear, bioeconomic programming model incorporated stock dynamics with the interactive economic effects of intrinsic fish quality, the harvest schedule, and the quota allocation between heterogeneous user groups. NPV was maximized when the intraseason timing of harvest {{coincided with the}} seasonal improvement in fish quality that follows spawning and migration. NPV was only marginally affected, however, by the quota allocation. The second paper employed processing-level surimi data to estimate the effect of production and policy-controlled variables on quality characteristics. Hedonic equations were then estimated to obtain the implicit price of each characteristic in distinct markets. Implicit prices were also estimated for grade, production location (onshore, at-sea), and production date. Results indicated that (1) species and the time between processing and harvesting both significantly affected the characteristics, (2) color and gel strength attributes had the largest price effect, and (3) market conditions can diminish the price effect of production-controlled factors. The third paper defined a theoretical model for managing commercial wild-caught fisheries. The model demonstrated that a delay in harvesting can increase NPV and stock size through improvements in intrinsic fish quality that positively impact production yields, fish size, and product price. In the empirical application, improved yields, heavier fish, and higher prices increased NPV by 38, 6, and 25 percent, respectively; multiplicative effects accounted for the remaining 31 percent. Sensitivity analysis in the final paper found that the optimal allocation to the onshore sector was inversely related {{to the size of}} the recruiting cohort due to current capacity constraints (relative to the average annual harvest). In addition, the policy objective(s) and interseason variability in intrinsic quality influenced NPV and the optimal management plan...|$|R
