This system will achieve high diversity, high transmission rate and multiplexing gain. Since the system is activating only a minimum number of antennas, thereby it can optimize by maximizing the inter-symbol distance and hence reduce the inter channel interference and inter antenna interference. A near optimal maximum likelihood decoding is proposed to reduce the decoding complexity. In this paper, the SER performance between <b>Multiple</b> Active Spatial <b>modulation</b> and Space Time Block Code was simulated.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method for diagnosing combination faults in planetary gearboxes. Vibration signals measured on the gearbox housing exhibit complicated characteristics because of <b>multiple</b> <b>modulations</b> of concurrent excitation sources, signal paths and noise. To separate these modulations accurately, a modulation signal bispectrum based sideband estimator (MSB-SE) developed recently {{is used to}} achieve a sparse representation for the complicated signal contents, which allows effective enhancement of various sidebands for accurate diagnostic information. Applying the proposed method to diagnose an industrial planetary gearbox which coexists both bearing faults and gear faults shows that the different severities of the faults can be separated reliably under different load conditions, confirming the superior performance of this MSB-SE based diagnosis scheme...|$|R

The long, quasi-continuous, high-precision data from MOST, CoRoT and Kepler revealed a wealth of new insights about this well-known variable class. One of the most surprising mysteries {{turned out to be}} the apparent omnipresence of a common additional mode in all RRd and RRc stars. Moreover, fundamental-mode stars seem to populate two distinct classes, one of which is characterized by the presence of additional modes and/or modulation, and another limited to strict single-mode pulsation. The presence of additional modes and <b>multiple</b> <b>modulations</b> in RRab stars allowed us to construct Petersen diagrams for these parameters: while the pulsation modes show clear structures according to period ratios, there seems to be no relation between the modulation periods themselves.
