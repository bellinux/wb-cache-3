500|$|The {{resultant}} {{design was}} named Tu-142 and had features {{in common with}} the Tu-95RT. The ventral and dorsal gun turrets were removed, as was the large dielectric radome housing the Uspeh radar system, which was replaced by a thermal imaging system located in a smaller fairing. This left the tail turret with twin 23-mm AM-23 cannons, along with electronic countermeasures, as the only defensive armament. The aircraft's search-and-targeting system featured Berkut (Golden Eagle) [...] A complex navigation system was integrated with the weapons targeting system. Structural differences included an airfoil change to the wing, expanding its area to [...] (...) [...] The area of the elevators was increased by 14%, and improved hydraulic actuators were fitted. <b>Metal</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks replaced rubber bladders. To allow the Tu-142 to operate from semi-prepared runways, the Tu-95's four-wheel main undercarriage bogies were replaced with six-wheel units; the main undercarriage fairings were also modified.|$|E
