40|$|The <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> {{vision of}} {{companies}} have been gaining {{a lot of attention}} both within the scholarly and business context. A lot of time and money is being invested to develop <b>and</b> implement <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision statements and business students {{all over the world are}} taught these concepts. However, literature on how <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision actually influence employees is limited and inconsistent. Therefore, this thesis explores how <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision influence employees’ work motivation. The study follows an inductive approach and has a qualitative nature. In order to build a basis for the research, various literatures on <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision and motivational theories are reviewed. Data was collected by the conduction of twelve interviews with employees in different job positions. The semi structured character of the interviews implied the use of templates to analyze the data. Thereby, categories and codes were developed and relationships between the individual motivation and the influence of <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision were identified. The results show that the influence of <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision cannot be generalized but is highly dependent on individual aspects. Intrinsically motivated employees are positively influenced by their company’s <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision. Hence, <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision can push intrinsic motivation. On the other hand, the motivating influence of a <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision is rather low on extrinsically motivated employees. Interestingly, the findings also show that <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision play a greater role for people in higher positions (top & middle managers). Front line employees are rather extrinsically motivated and less dedicated to their company’s <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision. The results contribute to existing literature by encouraging a more differentiated approach for dealing with the topic in taking the individual component into consideration. Furthermore, the findings bear potential for employers to apply <b>and</b> communicate their <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision more purposefully to motivate employees...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Edward R. Murrow School of Communication, Washington State UniversityOrganizational <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision play {{important}} roles {{in the life of}} an organization and well-being of its employees. While many researchers have studied <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision from leadership perspectives, little is known about employee constructions of their organization's <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision. Unlike previous research which approached <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision from rhetorical and socio-cultural perspectives, this study builds on a social constructionist foundation. Based on individual interviews with 45 employees from 22 organizations, this study seeks to understand how employees construct vision (in particular, the ideal future state of the organization, general values related to the ideal state, and authorship/source of vision) <b>and</b> <b>mission</b> (in particular, organization's reason for being, uniqueness, possible changes, customers, clients, market segments, products, services, economic concerns, specific values related to its present operations, and ownership of the mission). This study also addresses the question of how employees' constructions of <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision compare with the official versions of <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision. To answer the question, the author conducted a thematic analysis of employee responses as compared to official <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision statements found on organizations' Web sites. Results indicate lack of congruence between official and employee constructions of organizational <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision. This study suggests that the lack of congruence is due to poor communication of vision/mission by leaders, low employee awareness of the advantages of knowing vision/mission, employees' perceptions of vision/mission as irrelevant to daily work, and observed discrepancy between vision/mission and leaders' actions. These findings have important practical implications for organizational professionals. The study makes a significant contribution to <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision literature, as well as research on employee perceptions, employee alignment, organizational identification, and organizational control.

40|$|The {{world is}} globalising, {{we are living}} in an {{information}} society, consumption has acquired new content and form. Mankind has reached an era where needs and consumption no longer have a direct connection and through acquiring things we do not satisfy our direct needs but rather buy affiliation, status and contentment. Thus today’s retailing organisations have an important role to play in moulding and directing contemporary culture. In the thesis titled “Mission and Vision in retailing – based on Sportland Eesti AS’s example” the author examined <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision in retailing. A word is the simplest way of expressing thoughts generated from feelings and the utmost chance of amplifying them. It has been proven that word and thought have immense power, however <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision are the expression of a company’s existence put into words. The thesis’ main problems were: what are <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision, <b>and</b> how <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision affect the creation of a company’s strategy, concept and sales environment, positioning and differentiation from competitors. <b>Mission</b> <b>and</b> vision in retailing were viewed in the context of Sportland Eesti AS. Sportland Eesti AS is a part of Sportland International Group AS, where the subjects of <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision are paid considerable attention. The author’s long-term and tight relationship with Sportland most probably affected the distancing of the thesis {{but on the other hand}} it provided the possibility of contrasting theory and practical processes. The theoretical definition of <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision, and the connected themes played an important role in the thesis. The author’s analysis of Sportland’s <b>mission,</b> vision <b>and</b> values was based on a discourse analysis and in order to determine the opinions of Estonian retailing experts on <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision the author conducted and expert semi structured expert interview with them. The thesis alternates with the theoretical, literature based approach to <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision and the connected realms, phenomenon, activities etc and the author’s analysis and comments about Sportland and an overview of the opinions and citations from the interviews conducted with the Estonian retailing experts. In the first chapter the author gives a short overview of the Estonian retailing development over the past fifteen years. The development found longer coverage with the aim to find the breaking point where supply exceeded the demand. That very point may be considered to be the moment of entering a consumer society where the success and failure of companies is affected by different factors than before and where the subjects of <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision become presumably more important. The second chapter consisted of ponderings over the term consumer society with the help of different authors. The author also covered the development of the Sportland store chain from 1997 to the present day and gave an overview of the company’s structure. In the last part of the second chapter the author reviewed strategic planning. The third chapter described the thesis methodology. In the beginning of the chapter a short overview is given of the discourse analysis that was used to analyse Sportland’s <b>mission,</b> vision <b>and</b> values; the choice of interviewees, interview questions and other issues connected with the interviews were also covered. The fourth chapter is dedicated to <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision. In the first part of the chapter the author gives the theoretical definition of mission, then brings out the connections between <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> the power of word and thought and lastly analyses the mission of Sportland. The second part of the chapter covers vision. The chapter is concluded by the analysis of the interviews with the Estonian retailing experts. The fifth chapter reviews organisational values and structure and sixth positioning and its connections with <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision. The seventh chapter views concept and the development of the retailing environment, and the importance of <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision at that. Based on Sportland Eesti AS it could be said that a clearly worded <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision are a strong basis for the development of a retailer’s strategy, concept and the retailing environment and the clear-sighted and meaningful organisation of daily work. It is also clear that <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision aid in the differentiation from competitors. In principle all interviewed retailing experts considered the subject of <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision as the general basis for organising a company’s activities to be important, however, the opinions differed in the sense of how much the subject is paid attention to in Estonian retailing companies and how much attention should be paid to it. Based on the development of Sportland Eesti AS, it could be said that paying attention to those questions became actual in 2000. Also all interviewees agreed that in the 1990 s the subject of <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision had no practical value in Estonia and that the importance started increasing in 2000 when competition had become tighter. All interviewees also noted that through tightening competition also the importance of the so called softer issues becomes more important for the comapnies. Taking into consideration the volume of the thesis, it was not possible to cover all aspects connected with <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision. The discussion included a somewhat more thorough overview of the possible development directions of the thesis. The author was forced to leave out marketing in retailing and its connections to <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision, since the marketing subject itself is very extensive. The author also didn’t cover the subject of <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision from the aspect of human resources, i. e. the communication of the <b>mission</b> <b>and</b> vision to the organisation members and by the members...|$|R
