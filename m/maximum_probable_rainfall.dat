40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to predict and analyze the dam break flood in a real river valley. A numerical model was developed for simulating dam break flood and applied for analyzing flood situation due to the instantaneous hypothetical failure of the proposed dam in river Dibang, a major Himalayan tributary of the River Brahmaputra. Significant variation in bed slope, bed width and resistance characteristic along the channel length are the typical characteristics of Dibang river. To compute the flood under such dam failure conditions, natural channel is generally represented by a simplified channel.. Such simplification may lead to erroneous estimation of the important parameters such as <b>maximum</b> <b>probable</b> depth, peak arrival, <b>maximum</b> <b>probable</b> velocity and inundated area. Therefore, due emphasis should be given in the selection of an appropriate computational channel while simulating a real dam break flood.

The other approach considers only the original simplified river channel of Dibang. The predictions of dam Break Wave Propagation by both the methods have been compared and analyzed.

40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to develop}} a PMP {{estimation}} method in a basin-scale by considering both temporal and spatial characteristics and to compare the existing PMP estimation method with the developed method in this study.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} rainfall variability and uncertainties on the spatial scaling structure of peak flows using the Whitewater River basin in Kansas, and Iowa River basin in Iowa as illustrations. We illustrate why considering individual hydrographs at the outlet of a basin can lead to misleading interpretations {{of the effects of}} rainfall variability. The variability of rainfall is characterized in terms of storm intensity, duration, advection velocity, zero-rain intermittency, variance and spatial correlation structure. We begin with the simple scenario of a basin receiving spatially uniform rainfall of varying intensities and durations, and advection velocities. We then use a realistic space-time rainfall field obtained from a popular rainfall model that can reproduce desired storm variability and spatial structure. We employ a recent formulation of flow velocity for a network of channels and calculate peak flow scaling exponents, which are then compared to the scaling exponent of the channel network width function maxima. The study then investigates the role of hillslope characteristics on the peak flow scaling structure. The basin response at the smaller scales is driven by the rainfall intensities (and spatial variability), while the larger scale response is dominated by the rainfall volume as the river network aggregates the variability at the smaller scales. The results obtained from simulation scenarios {{can be used to make}} rigorous interpretations of the peak flow scaling structure obtained from actual space-time model, and actual radar-rainfall events measured by the NEXRAD weather radar network. An ensemble of <b>probable</b> <b>rainfall</b> fields conditioned on the given radar-rainfall field is then generated using a radar-rainfall error model and <b>probable</b> <b>rainfall</b> generator. The statistical structure of ensemble fields is then compared with that of given radar-rainfall field to quantify the impact of radar-rainfall errors on 1) spatial characterization of the rainfall events and 2) scaling structure of the peak flows. The effect of radar-rainfall errors is to introduce spurious correlations in the radar-rainfall fields, particularly at the smaller scales. However, preliminary results indicated that the radar-rainfall errors do not significantly affect the peak flow scaling exponents...|$|R
