This, {{together}} with a high shear modulus and a very low figure for Poisson's ratio (the relationship of longitudinal to lateral strain), indicate {{the high degree of}} stiffness and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty. Despite these limitations and iridium's high cost, a number of applications have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.|$|E
5|$|Titanium has the {{inherent}} ability to osseointegrate, enabling use in dental implants that {{can last for}} over 30 years. This property is also useful for orthopedic implant applications. These benefit from titanium's lower <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> (Young's modulus) to more closely match that of the bone that such devices are intended to repair. As a result, skeletal loads are more evenly shared between bone and implant, leading to a lower incidence of bone degradation due to stress shielding and periprosthetic bone fractures, which occur at the boundaries of orthopedic implants. However, titanium alloys' stiffness is still {{more than twice that}} of bone, so adjacent bone bears a greatly reduced load and may deteriorate.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is a steel {{gray and}} hard metal that is brittle at room {{temperature}} and has a close-packed hexagonal crystal structure. It has exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus 287 GPa) and a reasonably high melting point. The <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> of beryllium is approximately 50% {{greater than that of}} steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.|$|E

If the head of model (Fig. 1) is uniformly compressed without buckling to the axial direction by force P below elastic limit the pressure q per unit area of contact surface of compound cylinders develops, then the longitudinal strain of model εz and the tangential strain εt at contact circumferential surface shall be expressed by the following equation. [the equation is omitted] then q will be determined from the two conditions that εz 1 =εz 0 and εt 1 =εt 0. For the calculation of E and m, I assume the helical spring which the total length of steel wire l is satisfied with the next conditions; l= 2 πRn/cosα=h/sinα and use the following ezuations; [omitted] An example of results obtainable by these equations is shown in Table 2. From this table it is evident that as α in the inside cylinder decreases εz increases, consequently the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> longitudinal <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> the model decreases. From the above-mentioned results one of the causes that the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> longitudinal <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> compression wood is ever very small to comparison with normal wood may be existed in the lower fibrillar slope in the center layer of the secondary wall of compression wood tracheid. 針葉樹アテ材の縦弾性係数に関しては実験観察方法の個人的差異, 或は又供試材に於けるアテ形成程度の定量的表現の困難性等の為必ずしも定則的結論を得るに至つてはいないが, 圧縮並びに引張弾性係数はいづれも同比重の正常材に比し甚だ僅少であるという事実が多くの研究者により実証され, 又との原因に就いても細胞膜の構造的特性その他との関連に於て種々考察が加えられている. 著者もこの原因の一つが細胞膜のヒブリル構造, 就中第二次肥厚膜の中層に於けるヒブリル傾斜が正常材に比し甚だ緩であることに帰せられると考え, バネ弾性を応用せる繊維膜の力学的構造仮読模型を想定し, これに縦軸方向の荷重を作用せしめ, その際の応力と歪の関係よリバネの螺旋傾斜角の変化に対応する縦弾性係数増減の力学的解析を試みた...|$|R

An experimental study was conducted to investigate mechanical properties of energy efficient concrete with binary, ternary and quaternary admixture at different curing ages. Slump test for workability and air content test were performed on fresh concretes. Compressive strength, splitting tensile strength were made on hardened concrete specimens.

25|$|The {{buckling}} {{strength of a}} member {{is less than the}} elastic {{buckling strength}} of a structure if the material of the member is stressed beyond the elastic material range and into the non-linear (plastic) material behavior range. When the compression load is near the buckling load, the structure will bend significantly and the material of the column will diverge from a linear stress-strain behavior. The stress-strain behavior of materials is not strictly linear even below the yield point, hence the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> decreases as stress increases, and significantly so as the stresses approach the material's yield strength. This reduced material rigidity reduces the buckling strength of the structure and results in a bucking load less than that predicted by the assumption of linear elastic behavior.|$|E

The dividing line between intermediate and long timber columns cannot be readily evaluated. One way of defining the lower limit of long timber columns would be to set it as the smallest value of the ratio of length to least cross sectional area that would just exceed a certain constant K of the material. Since K depends on the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> and the allowable compressive stress parallel to the grain, {{it can be seen that}} this arbitrary limit would vary with the species of the timber.

25|$|There are {{two classes}} of {{non-toxic}} anti-fouling coatings. The most common class relies on low friction and low surface energies. Low surface energies result in hydrophobic surfaces. These coatings create a smooth surface which can prevent attachment of larger microorganisms. For example, fluoropolymers and silicone coatings are commonly used. These coatings are ecologically inert but have problems with mechanical strength and long-term stability. Specifically, after days biofilms (slime) can coat the surfaces which buries the chemical activity and allows microorganisms to attach. The current standard for these coatings is polydimethylsiloxane, or PDMS, which consists of a non-polar backbone made of repeating units of silicon and oxygen atoms. The non-polarity of PDMS allows for biomolecules to readily adsorb to its surface in order to lower interfacial energy. However, PDMS also has a low <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> that allows {{for the release of}} fouling organisms at speeds of greater than 20 knots. The dependence of effectiveness on vessel speed prevents use of PDMS on slow-moving ships or those that spend significant amounts of time in port.|$|E

His work had also gained the attention of several people who were later to give him work, including Stanislas de la Roche Toulay, who had prepared the design for the metalwork of the Bordeaux bridge, Jean Baptiste Krantz and Wilhelm Nordling. Further promotion within the company followed, but the business began to decline, and in 1865 Eiffel, seeing no future there, resigned and set up as an independent consulting engineer. He was already working independently on the construction of two railway stations, at Toulouse and Agen, and in 1866 he was given a contract to oversee the construction of 33 locomotives for the Egyptian government, a profitable but undemanding job in the course of which he visited Egypt, where he visited the Suez Canal which was being constructed by Ferdinand de Lesseps. At the same time he was employed by Jean-Baptiste Kranz to assist him {{in the design of the}} exhibition hall for the Exposition Universelle which was to be held in 1867.

The mechanical properties (i.e., <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> rupture and <b>elasticity,</b> internal bonding strength) of boards increased with increasing board density and met the requirement for 15 type medium-density fiberboard (MDF) by JIS A 5905 - 1994.
