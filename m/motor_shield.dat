40|$|This {{essay is}} about {{controlling}} a hybrid two phase step motor via an {{open loop control}} system based on Arduino Uno microcontroller. We program the microcontroller so that the system can perform all the basic functions that a step motor is capable of. All the excitation modes are possible. We constract the motor’s speed profile through a numerical method {{so that we can}} monitor it’s behaviour in a step by step manner. Knowing the speed profile we can deside if a particular step motor is suitable for a specific application or not. We can examine if the motor can fullfill all the requirements imposed by the system designer. For example if the motor is capable of reaching it’s pull out rate, or to perform a specific number of steps in a certain amount of time. A more intresting requirement is if we want the motor to excecute a specific number of steps with a specific speed within a very strict time frame without missing the target possition. We can confront such requirements in robotics, CNC machines, plotters and other modern machinery.

40|$|Introduction We have {{developed}} a low-cost stopcock valve actuator for radiochemistry automation built using a stepper motor and an Arduino, an open-source single-board microcontroller. The con-troller hardware can be programmed to run by serial communication or via two 5 – 24 V digital lines for simple integration into any automation control system. This valve actuator allows for automated use of a single, disposable stopcock, providing a number of advantages over stopcock manifold systems available on many commercial radiochemistry rigs or over using solenoid valves. This actuator allows for the use {{a wide variety of}} stopcocks, ranging in size, shape and material, giving flexibility to be used in a large variety of applications. Material and Methods The actuated valve consists of two main parts, the actuator and the control electronics. The actuator consists of a stepper motor, an infrared ‘home position’ sensor, a stopcock backplate, and a coupler from the driveshaft to stopcock handle. The stepper motor is a NEMA- 17 size that runs 200 steps/rotation with a 5 mm drive shaft. The coupler is an interchangeable part, custom to each stopcock model, with each part drilled out to fit the motor drive shaft and milled out for a tight fit to the stopcock handle. The backplane consists of a plate offset from the motor body with 5 screws positioned to keep the stopcock body from rotating relative to the motor. A reflective optical sensor (Vishay TCRT 1000) is used as a limit switch to determine a ‘home’ position for the stopcock. With a slight modification to most any stopcock in cutting off a tab that limits rotation, the handle can rotate 360 °. This allows for opening all three ports to each other, which has been done to all stopcocks used with this actuator. The control electronics consist of an Arduino Uno board and a <b>motor</b> <b>shield</b> (add-on board), connecting to the actuator by an Ethernet cable. The <b>motor</b> <b>shield</b> functions to interface the low-power Arduino circuitry with a high power H-bridge motor driver circuit. The Arduino runs two sets of code, initialization and its loop. The initialization routine runs when power is first powered up, and then continues to run the loop. The initialization routine rotates the valve until the IR limit switch is activated, and rotates an-other 45 ° from position home, sealing off all ports on the stopcock. Following initialization, the Arduino enters its loop, which repeatedly compares its current position to its target posi-tion. When the target position and current posi-tion do not match, the stepper motor turns in the shortest direction towards its target position. The hardware can be interfaced by either serial communication or by two 5 – 24 V digital signals defining positions 1 – 4. The wide range of allowed input signal voltages is realized by using an optocoupler that accepts 5 – 24 V inputs but outputs TTL signals compatible with the Arduino’s hardware. Results and Conclusion A photo of the implementation of the actuator is shown in FIGURE 1. It has overall dimensions of 3. 5 × 1. 75 × 2. 5 ”, excluding a mounting bracket. Control electronics are housed in a compact box built for an Arduino, giving the control electron-ics a clean, professional look.

40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2015 People rely on GPS {{to reach}} {{destination}}s, {{but once the}} destination is reached, there is no system for navigation to a desired location inside a building. With an indoor positioning system (IPS), users could view their location in a building and determine indoor routes. Additionally, the FCC has set an objective to implement IPS to improve E 911 accuracy. Currently, there are over 200 start-ups and large firms in competition to develop IPS, with most utilizing signals such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or WiFi. A better IPS product can be developed using magnetic positioning to generate a magnetic field using an extremely low frequency (ELF) signal. ELF consumes little energy and can travel through walls and objects; therefore avoiding troublesome issues encountered with BLE and WiFi. The main challenge with magnetic positioning {{is the size of}} the copper coil used to generate the magnetic field: it must be large enough to create a strong field, yet small enough for integration as a beacon into building infrastructure. The ELF beacon is rectangular-shaped for placement above doorways to tag users upon entering a room. Tagging occurs when the user’s smartphone magnetometer detects the dipole magnetic field of the beacon. The field is generated using a set-up that mimics a signal generator: Arduino Uno connected to Arduino <b>Motor</b> <b>Shield,</b> running C-code to create an ELF square wave, powered by batteries. By setting each beacon frequency to a distinctive value, user location can be determined based on unique identification. The prototype beacon’s coil was wound by hand; therefore the largest gauge wire could not be used due breakage risk and the prototype is not fully optimized in terms of size. Future plans include winding a 40 gauge copper wire by machine with multiple layers for further size optimization...|$|E
40|$|Creating {{intelligent}} systems that can sense {{and interact with}} their environment {{has been a huge}} factor behind the work on artificial intelligence and automation. It involves multidisciplinary and complex technology that has proven to be challenging for researchers working in that area. Despite this, great {{progress has been made in}} this area of study over recent years and automated systems can be found everywhere in our daily lives from the automobile industry to manufacturing. The aim of this project involves investigating the idea of an autonomous tracking device. This device will be based on an autonomous luggage piece which would make a traveller’s journey a lot easier. It is important to keep in mind that this idea could be implemented on more than just luggage. Other systems this could be implemented on would be shopping trolleys, golf bags or even for film making. In order to achieve autonomy, background research on triangulation was conducted and is presented in this document. The sensors used for distance measurements were modified ultrasonic sensors used in combination with radio and Bluetooth transmitters. The whole project involved the design of two devices, one carried by the person and hence referred to as ‘the personal device’ throughout this document and one tracking robot. The tracking device’s control circuit was placed on a rigid body with two DC motor driven wheels at the front. Power was supplied by using a battery pack and the device’s brain consisted of Arduino microcontrollers. The <b>motor</b> <b>shield</b> purchased to drive these motors failed to work properly and hence the device could not be tested as an autonomous device.

40|$|An Induction motor {{reliability}} survey at an egg {{processing plant}} shows that almost 50 % {{of the total}} motor failures are fan induction motors. Visual investigations of the faulty fan motors show that {{the main cause of}} the induction motor failure is air gap eccentricity. In this study, experimental tests are performed on a 1. 1 kW three-phase induction motor to detect air gap eccentricity and overheating of the induction motor. Heating tests show that end shield housing temperature reaches 100 °C with blocked air flow from the fan, which can reduce the lifespan of the bearing. Dimension measurements of the end shield housing show that the dimensions of both tested <b>motors</b> back-end <b>shields</b> are larger than ISO tolerance grade limit. It leads to a loose fit between the housing and bearing, causing air gap eccentricity. Also, both <b>motor</b> back end <b>shield</b> housing has an out-of-round condition leading to an unbalanced magnetic pull. To detect the air gap eccentricity caused by too loose of a fit between housing bore and bearing, current Park’s vector approach is used. To measure three phase current, Hall Effect current transducers, a digital oscilloscope is used and Matlab software to process the measurement data. Results show that Park’s vector approach can be used to detect the air gap eccentricity caused by too loose a fit between bearing and housing. Therefore, the Park’s vector approach can be used to diagnose air gap eccentricity and analyse the type of the air gap eccentricity...|$|R

40|$|In {{this survey}} paper, we show by {{straightforward}} mathematical scaling considerations that small inverter-fed ac motors of tip to typical 20 kW at 1500 /min {{are likely to}} suffer from discharge (electric discharge machining) bearing currents, whereas larger motors are likely to be subjected to high-frequency (HF) circulating bearing currents. When comparing motors that operate at the same voltage level, the resulting bearing-current density is high for very small and very large motors. Smaller values occur in between these two extremes with medium size motors in the range of 10 - 100 kW. Therefore, electric bearing insulation is useful for larger motors to interrupt the HF circulating bearing-current path, whereas small <b>motors</b> need rotor <b>shielding,</b> common-mode voltage filters, or hybrid bearings. ...|$|R

The dynamic model reveals {{that the number of}} the driving motor can affect the performances of the shield TBM driving system.

Through maximizing the shield TBM cutterhead&# 39;s speed-torque gain of the single induction <b>motor</b> or <b>shield</b> TBM cutterhead&# 39;s speed-total-torque gain of all induction motors, we obtain the optimum transmission ratio (OTR) and the optimum reduction ratio (ORR) of the shield TBM cutterhead driving system.

40|$|A {{new type}} of ultra low-background gamma-ray {{spectrometer}} has been installed in the underground laboratory HADES in Belgium located {{at a depth of}} 500 m water equivalent. The spectrometer is composed of two coaxial HPGe-detectors of about 1. 9 kg each. The lower detector has the typical U-shaped arm while the top detector's arm is inverted to make the two detectors' windows face each other. The solid angle is effectively doubled for small samples and close to 3. 2 p. The muon fluence rate in HADES is 0. 09 s- 1 m- 2, which is about 5000 times lower than at the surface (40 m above sea level). The detailed muon spectrum is measured with an active muon shield comprising two plastic scintillators stacked on top of the lead shield. The plastic scintillators are 2. 5 cm thick and with an area of 0. 8 × 0. 8 m 2. The scintillators are connected in coincidence to exclude environmental gamma- and X-rays. All data is stored in list mode, which is suitable for offline analysis of time-interval distributions, coincidences and subsequent background reduction. A completely {{new type of}} lead shield is used around the HPGe-detectors. The outer part of the shield is made of 145 mm low-background lead (20 Bq/kg) while the inner 40 mm is made of ultra low-background lead (2. 5 Bq/kg), which in turn is lined on the inside with 35 mm of electrolytic copper.

40|$|The Liquid Waste Technology Development {{organization}} is investigating technologies to support closure of radioactive waste tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Tank closure includes {{removal of the}} wastes that have propagated to the tank annulus. Although amounts and types of residual waste materials in the annuli of SRS tanks vary, simple salt deposits are predominant on tanks with known leak sites. This task focused on developing and demonstrating a technology to inspect and spot clean salt deposits from the outer primary tank wall located in the annulus of an SRS Type I tank. The Robotics, Remote and Specialty Equipment (RRSE) and Materials Science and Technology (MS&T) Sections of the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) collaborated to modify and equip a Force Institute magnetic wall crawler with the tools necessary to demonstrate the inspection and spot cleaning in a mock-up of a Type I tank annulus. A remote control camera arm and cleaning head were developed, fabricated and mounted on the crawler. The crawler was then tested and demonstrated on a salt simulant also developed in this task. The demonstration showed that the camera is capable of being deployed in all specified locations and provided the views needed for the planned inspection. It also showed that the salt simulant readily dissolves with water. The crawler features two different techniques for delivering water to dissolve the salt deposits. Both water spay nozzles were able to dissolve the simulated salt, one is more controllable and the other delivers a larger water volume. The cleaning head also includes a rotary brush to mechanically remove the simulated salt nodules in the event insoluble material is encountered. The rotary brush proved {{to be effective in}} removing the salt nodules, although some fine tuning may be required to achieve the best results. This report describes the design process for developing technology to add features to a commercial wall crawler and the results of the demonstration testing performed on the integrated system. The crawler was modified to address the two primary objectives of the task (inspection and spot cleaning). SRNL recommends this technology as a viable option for annulus inspection and salt removal in tanks with minimal salt deposits (such as Tanks 5 and 6.) This report further recommends that the technology be prepared for field deployment by: (1) developing an improved mounting system for the magnetic idler wheel, (2) improving the robustness of the cleaning tool mounting, (3) resolving the nozzle selection valve connections, (4) determining alternatives for the brush and bristle assembly, and (5) adding a protective housing around the <b>motors</b> to <b>shield</b> them from water splash. In addition, SRNL suggests further technology development to address annulus cleaning issues that are apparent on other tanks that will also require salt removal in the future such as: (1) Developing a duct drilling device to facilitate dissolving salt inside ventilation ducts and draining the solution out the bottom of the ducts.
