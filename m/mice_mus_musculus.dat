5|$|The New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) {{is a major}} visitor and {{pollinator}} of Banksia verticillata. These birds {{can travel}} 15m (50ft) between inflorescences in a feeding session, and preferentially choose flower spikes with partly opened flowers. Other honeyeater species observed, the white-cheeked honeyeater (Phylidonyris nigra) and western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus), visit this species to a much lesser extent. The brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta) has also been recorded as a visitor. Small mammals are not major pollinators, although bush rats (Rattus fuscipes) and house <b>mice</b> (<b>Mus</b> <b>musculus)</b> have been recorded. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) visit flower spikes but are not effective pollinators.|$|E

2500|$|The {{adaptive}} {{significance of}} polyandry in animals is controversial. Polyandry has direct benefits for females allowing fertilization assurance, provision of resources, and parental {{care for their}} offspring. House <b>mice</b> (<b>Mus</b> <b>musculus</b> musculus) have shown indirect, genetic benefits, where females have increased offspring survival through multiple mating, showing that practicing polyandry mating results {{in an increase in}} offspring viability. In a meta analysis, including 10 different orders of insects, polyandry increased the production of eggs by females specifically in Lepidopterans and Orthopterans. Indirect benefits of mating for females can be gained through sperm competition to attain [...] "good genes", cryptic female choice, increased genetic quality, and genetic diversity. Females spiders (Pisaura mirabilis) store more sperm from gift-giving males suggesting that sperm storage is under female control through cryptic sperm choice. The increase in sperm storage from the gift giving males might allow females to produce [...] "sexy sons" [...] that also give gifts and increase the fitness of offspring. Sperm storage and fertilization success increased with copulation duration, suggesting an advantage in sperm competition.|$|E

2500|$|What all primary rodent prey species {{share is}} that they are either nocturnal or crepuscular and are often common to {{abundant}} in openings of woods and rocky environments. The reason Eurasian eagle-owls take rats, which associate rather closely with humans, much more regularly than they take house <b>mice</b> (<b>Mus</b> <b>musculus)</b> is not their larger size (many other rodents regularly taken by eagle-owls are as small or smaller than a house mouse) but the rat’s ability to flourish along the edges of crop fields, refuse dumps, roadsides and abandoned buildings and fields, whereas the mice are more closely tied to active human habitations. A single refuse dump can host several thousand rats and eagle-owl territories that include dumps can locally expect higher productivity due to the abundance of this food source. Squirrels are readily predated but, being diurnal, are largely unavailable to this and other owls. When they are captured, it is presumably around dawn or dusk from their tree hole, in species such as the widespread [...] red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), or burrow entrance, in the case of ground squirrels, most regularly recorded as prey in Asia Minor and the Central Asia. A few specimens of the [...] woolly flying squirrels (Eupetaurus cinereus), the largest of the world’s flying squirrels and one of the rarest, were the only identified foods for Eurasian eagle-owls in northern Pakistan alongside some European hares. Although not common in the diet, a few species of marmot have been taken and may be an important aspect of the prey biomass. In Europe, adult-sized alpine marmots, (Marmota marmota) have been killed. However, the average weight of Tarbagan marmots (Marmota sibirica) taken in Mongolia was only [...] and that of alpine marmots in Engadin, Switzerland was only [...] These obviously comprising young marmots as adults have average weights from , from spring low weights to pre-hibernation weights during autumn hypophagia. Other than marmots, the largest rodent known to be hunted by Eurasian eagle-owls is the introduced aquatic rodents, the muskrat (Ondatra zibethica), which in one study estimated to average [...] when taken, and the nutria (Myocastor coypus), equal in size to the large marmots.|$|E

50|$|Hymenolepis microstoma is an obligate parasite. Adults {{live in the}} {{bile duct}} and small {{intestine}} of rodents such as <b>mice</b> (<b>Mus</b> <b>musculus),</b> and larvae infect grain beetles such as Tribolium spp., in which they metamorphose from larvae into juvenile worms. Worms vary from 4 to 30 cm in length, depending on the age and number of worms within the host. Adults have completely lost their mouth and intestine. Instead they use their skin (tegument) to absorb nutrients directly from the host gut.|$|E
50|$|In whole animal-based approaches, {{phenotypic}} screening is best exemplified where {{a substance}} is evaluated for potential therapeutic benefit across {{many different types}} of animal models representing different disease states. Phenotypic screening in animal-based systems utilize model organisms to evaluate the effects of a test agent in fully assembled biological systems. Example organisms used for high-content screening include the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), zebrafish (Danio rerio) and <b>mice</b> (<b>Mus</b> <b>musculus).</b> In some instances the term phenotypic screening is used to include the serendipitous findings that occur in clinical trial settings particularly when new and unanticipated therapeutic effects of a therapeutic candidate are uncovered.|$|E

50|$|A study {{published}} in 2009 showed that the world population of the northern rockhopper had declined by 90% since the 1950s, possibly because of climate change, changes in marine ecosystems and overfishing for squid and octopus by humans.

Surveys show that the birds {{are at risk of}} infection by goose barnacles. house <b>mice</b> (<b>Mus</b> <b>musculus)</b> have been introduced into their environment by human sea expeditions.

50|$|The eastern {{indigo snake}} is carnivorous, like all snakes, and will eat any other small animal it can overpower. It {{has been known}} to kill its prey by beating it against nearby objects.
