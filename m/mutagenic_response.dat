40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The Salmonella/mammalian-microsome {{mutagenicity}} {{test was used}} to evaluate Senecio jacobaea (SJ) plant, Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) and metabolites in goat milk, to evaluate response differences with microsomes from several animal species and to compare SJ plant responses to other plants. Bioassessment experiments were conducted to evaluate PA toxicity changes associated with copper (Cu) and molybdenum (Mo) ingestion in sheep and esterase inhibition, microsomal enzyme induction and cysteine supplement in rats. Acetone extracts of SJ caused negative or toxic <b>mutagenic</b> <b>responses</b> in the absence of liver microsomes and positive responses after microsomal activation. Senecio PA and monocrotaline gave only negative responses. Milk from SJ-fed goats produced positive <b>mutagenic</b> <b>responses</b> after microsomal activation. Only slight species microsomal differences were observed. Acetone extracts from alfalfa, lettuce and thread-leaf groundsel gave only negative <b>mutagenic</b> <b>responses.</b> Comfrey extracts produced toxic responses that were abolished by the microsomal system. Bracken produced a positive response after bioactivation with liver microsomes. The dietary addition of Cu or Cu and Mo to SJ diets fed to lambs caused only marginal effects on LiverCu levels and no anparenthemolvtic effects. Lambs died after eating about 100 % of their body weight in dried SJ with lambs fed the SJ+Cu+Mo diet dying about four wks before lambs fed the SJ+Cu diet. Dietary exposure to esterase inhibiting organophosphates and carbamate resulted in increased PA toxicity. Increased toxicity was demonstrated by decreased PA (Senecio longilobus) LD₅₀ values after dietary exposure to organophosphates (coumaphos, tri-o-cresyl phosphate and malathion) or the carbamate (carbaryl). Rats fed a SJ diet with tri-o-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) had decreased (P<. 05) weight gain while rats fed a SJ diet with 2 -pyridine aldoxime methiodide (2 -PAM) had similar weight gain to those fed just the SJ diet. Rats fed SJ, SJ+ TOCP or SJ+ 2 -PAM diets had similar survival times (approx 60 d). Induction of microsomal enzymes by phenobarbital (PB) or dietary eucalyptus leaves caused only marginal effects on the acute LD₅₀ for a PA (Senecio longilobus) mixture. Dietary phenothiazine (PT) did not alter SJ toxicity but did cause reduced feed intake and weight gain. Rats fed SJ with cysteine had increased (P<. 05) survival time and SJ ingestion and slightly increased weight gain.

However, LOH events do not occur only in genetically unstable cancer cells but also have been detected in normal somatic cells of mouse and man. Mice, in which one of the alleles for adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Aprt) has been disrupted by gene targeting, were used to investigate the potency of carcinogens to induce LOH in vivo. After 7, 12 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benz[a]anthracene (DMBA) exposure, a 3 -fold stronger <b>mutagenic</b> <b>response</b> was detected at the autosomal Aprt gene than at the X chromosomal hypoxantine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) gene in splenic T-lymphocytes. Allele-specific PCR analysis showed that the normal, nontargeted Aprt allele was lost in 70 % of the DMBA-induced Aprt mutants. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that the targeted allele had become duplicated in almost all DMBA-induced mutants that displayed LOH at Aprt. These results indicate that the main mechanisms by which DMBA caused LOH were mitotic recombination or chromosome loss and[*]duplication but not deletion. However, after treatment with the alkylating agent N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, Aprt had a similar <b>mutagenic</b> <b>response</b> to Hprt while the majority (90 %) of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced Aprt mutants had retained both alleles. Unexpectedly, irradiation with x-rays, which induce primarily large deletions, resulted in a significant increase of the mutant frequency at Hprt but not at Aprt.

In contrast, a lexA 11 strain carrying any of these plasmids was nonmutable by UV. This unexpected behavior was abolished when the lexA 11 mutation was complemented in trans by the lexA gene of S. typhimurium. The results of UV mutagenesis correlated well with those of survival to UV irradiation, indicating that MucAB and UmuDCEc proteins participate in the error-prone repair of UV damage in lexA 552 but not in lexA 11. These intriguing differences between the <b>mutagenic</b> <b>responses</b> of lexA 552 and lexA 11 mutants to UV irradiation are discussed, taking into account the different degrees to which the SOS response is derepressed in these mutants...|$|R
40|$|Two {{conflicting}} phenomena, the bystander {{effect and}} the adaptive response, {{are important in}} determining biological re-sponses at low doses of radiation and {{have the potential to}} have an impact on the shape of the dose–response relation-ship. Using the Columbia University charged-particle micro-beam and the highly sensitive AL cell mutagenic assay, we reported previously that nonirradiated cells acquired muta-genesis through direct contact with cells whose nuclei had pre-viously been traversed with either a single or 20 a particles each. Here we show that pretreatment of cells with a low dose of X rays 4 h before a-particle irradiation significantly de-creased this bystander <b>mutagenic</b> <b>response.</b> Furthermore, by-stander cells showed an increase in sensitivity after a subse-quent challenging dose of X rays. Results from the present study address some of the pressing issues regarding both the actual target size and the radiation dose response and can improve on our current understanding of radiation ris...|$|E
40|$|A {{modification}} of the Ames assay using rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) liver postmitochondrial fraction (PMF) was developed to investigate the relative mutagenic potential {{of a series of}} aflatoxins (AFs). Preliminary experiments revealed that the 20 000 x g (S 20) liver fraction contained a higher metabolic activity than either the S 9 or S 30 fractions, and that 5 mg of S 20 protein/plate gave the highest <b>mutagenic</b> <b>response.</b> A 9 – 24 h preincubation period at 25 °C was also required. The results from comparative mutagenicity experiments showed the following relative potencies: AFB 1 3 ̆e AFL 3 ̆e AFG 1 3 ̆e AFM 1 3 ̆e AFB 2 3 ̆e AFP 1 3 ̆e AFQ 1. The relative potencies observed with this in vitro system qualitatively correlated with the in vivo carcinogenic activity seen in trout, indicating that this assay is of value in predicting the carcinogenic potential of mycotoxins in this species...|$|E
40|$|The {{animal studies}} {{described}} here {{were carried out}} according to Home Office regulations and under the guidance issued by the Medical Research Council [S 1]. Normal inbred mouse strains were obtained from either Charles River or Harlan. Scy (GENA 175) was detected in F 1 mice generated from ENU-treated BALB/cAnN males mated with C 3 H/He females [S 2] and were maintained by backcrossing to C 3 H/HeH. Crsh (MUT 1494) was detected in a study investigating the <b>mutagenic</b> <b>response</b> of F 1 [C 3 H/HeH 101 /H] males to various ENU dose fractionations (B. C., unpublished data). Mutagenized males were mated with females from the PT-specific locus tester stock that is homozygous for seven visible loci, and the progeny were screened for mutations at these loci and also for new dominant mutations. The MUT 1494 stock was initially maintained in crosses with F 1 [C 3 H/HeH 101 /H] mice, and offspring were then bred to BALB/c for one generation to enabl...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mutagenic</b> {{specificity}} in <b>response</b> {{to chemical}} mutagens {{has been observed}} with certain temperature-sensitive mutants of reovirus type 3. One mutant induced by nitrous acid reverted specifically with nitrous acid. Three nitrosoguanidine-induced mutants reverted after nitrous acid treatment. These findings thus suggest that analysis of chemical induction of reversion from the temperature-sensitive phenotype may be a useful approach for studying the nature of mutation in animal viruses...|$|R
40|$|Background: Laser {{irradiation}} of congenital melanocytic nevi is {{a controversial}} treatment. Recurrence of lesions after laser treatment {{appears to be}} the rule, and the effects of laser irradiation on cellular biological behavior and the possible <b>mutagenic</b> <b>responses</b> of nevomelanocytes that have received nonlethal doses of irradiation are still unclear. Without treatment, there is an increased potential for malignant degeneration over a life-time. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effects of Q-switched lasers on congenital nevi and to explain the mechanism(s) behind the response of the nevi to laser treatment. Five congenital nevi were divided into 3 equal parts: 1 part was treated with the Q-switched ruby laser at a wavelength of 694 nm, 1 part was treated with the Q-switched neodymium:YAG laser at a wavelength of 1064 nm, and 1 part was left untreated to serve as control. At intervals ranging from 3 days to 3 months after laser irradiation, the lesions were excised and evaluated by routine staining. This clinical study was conducted entirely at the Massachusetts General Hospital Dermatology Laser Center, Boston, Mass. Observations: Both the superficial and the deep portions of the congenital melanocytic nevi were affected by the 2 lasers, as evidenced by macroscopic inspection as well as microscopic evaluation. However, the Q-switched laser treatment did not destroy all nevomelanocytes, particularly in the deeper, less pigmented portions of the lesions. Conclusions: Both the Q-switched ruby laser and the neodymium:YAG laser often removed only the superficial portion of the congenital melanocytic nevi. The Q-switched ruby laser (694 nm) appeared to be more effective in removing nevomelanocytes than the Q-switched neodymium:YAG laser (1064 nm) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{approach}} {{was used to}} measure the genotoxicity of creosote-contaminated soil before and after four bioremediation processes. The soil was taken from the Reilly Tar site, a closed Superfund site in Saint Louis Park, Minnesota. The creosote soil was bioremediated in bioslurry, biopile, compost, and land treatment, which were optimized for effective treatment. Mutagenicity profiles of dichloromethane extracts of the five soils were determined in the Spiral technique of the Salmonella assay with seven tester strains. Quantitative <b>mutagenic</b> <b>responses</b> in the plate incorporation technique were then determined in the most sensitive strains, YG 1041 and YG 1042. Mutagenic potency (revertants per microgram extract) in YG 1041 suggested that compost, land treatment, and untreated creosote soil extracts were moderately mutagenic with Arochlor-induced rat liver (S 9) but were nonmutagenic without S 9. However, the bioslurry extract was strongly mutagenic and the biopile extract was moderately mutagenic either with or without S 9. A similar trend was obtained in strain YG 1042. The strong mutagenic activity in the bioslurry extract was reduced by 50 % in TA 98 NR, which suggested the presence of mutagenic nitrohydrocarbons. Variation in reproducibility was 15 % or less for the bioassay and extraction procedures. Bioavailability of mutagens in the biopile soil was determined with six solvents; water-soluble mutagens accounted for 40 % of the total mutagenic activity and they were stable at room temperature. The mutagenic activity in the bioslurry and biopsile samples was due to either the processes themselves or to the added sludge/manure amendments. The in vitro approach was effective in monitoring bioremediated soils for genotoxicity and will be useful in future laboratory and in situ studies...|$|R
