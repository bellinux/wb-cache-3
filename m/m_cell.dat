40|$|To {{clarify the}} nature of <b>M</b> <b>cells,</b> the {{detailed}} ultrastructural characteristics and lectin-binding properties of <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> were investigated in follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) of chicken caecal tonsils. <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> presented various outlines from columnar to dome shaped. Their polymorphism was dependent {{on the number of}} harboured intraepithelial migrating cells. The lighter and larger nuclei of <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> were situated at more apical levels in the epithelial lining compared with those of neighbouring microvillous epithelial cells. The microvilli, which were significantly shorter and thicker than those of adjacent microvillous epithelial cells, were sparsely distributed or completely absent on the apical surfaces of <b>M</b> <b>cells.</b> In general, the apical cytoplasm of <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> without microvilli protruded slightly into the intestinal lumen. Numerous small vesicles were often contained in the apical cytoplasm. The numerous small invaginations of the apical and lateral cell surfaces suggested active transportation of luminal substances. No canaliculi existed in the apical cytoplasm of <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> whereas they were often detected in the neighbouring microvillous epithelial cells. A noteworthy finding was the frequent detection of multivesicular bodies in the apical cytoplasm of <b>M</b> <b>cells.</b> These multivesicular bodies suggest some degradation of ingested luminal substances during transcytoplasmic transportation.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: The follicle-associated {{epithelium}} (FAE) of Peyer's patches mainly {{consists of}} two cell types: absorptive enterocytes with a brush border and <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> without this apical specialization. To study the controversial ontogeny of <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> (mesenchymal vs. epithelial origin), the expression pattern of tissue-specific cytoskeletal proteins, markers of cell origin that {{play a crucial role}} in the specific shape of epithelial cells and brush border assembly, was investigated. METHODS: The localization of cytokeratins, vimentin, and villin was determined on mouse FAE using immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Epithelial-specific cytokeratins were expressed in both absorptive enterocytes and <b>M</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas vimentin was not detected in mouse FAE. Villin, a tissue-specific, actin-binding protein of the brush border, was expressed in the two cell types.

Recent studies have uncovered a unique population of cells in the midmyocardial region of the canine ventricle. These <b>cells,</b> named <b>M</b> <b>cells,</b> were found to possess electrophysiologic features and a pharmacologic responsiveness {{different from those of}} other myocardial cells. Although well characterized in the dog, their presence or absence in the human heart is unknown. Methods. Standard microelectrode techniques were used to map slices of ventricular free wall obtained from normal human hearts (n = 4). Preparations were paced at cycle lengths ranging from 1 to 10 s. Results. We identified three cell subtypes: endocardial, subepicardial (<b>M</b> <b>cells)</b> and epicardial cells. The principal features differentiating <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> from the other cell subtypes were their longer action potential duration, more accentuated action potential duration rate relations and greater maximal rate of increase in action potential upstroke (Vmax). Our findings suggest that <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> represent ∼ 30 % of the cellular mass of the left ventricular wall. Concordance between changes in their repolarization and changes in QTU interval provide support for the role of <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> in the generation of the electrocardiographic (ECG) U wave.

40|$|Mucosal immune {{surveillance}} depends on M cells that {{reside in the}} epithelium overlying Peyer’s patch and nasopharyngeal associated lymphoid tissue to transport particles to underlying lymphocytes. <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> development is associated with B lymphocytes in a basolateral pocket, but the interactions between these cells are poorly understood. In a cell culture model of <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, we found lymphotoxin/tumor necrosis factor α induction of CD 137 (TNFRSF 9) protein on intestinal epithelial cell lines, raising the possibility that CD 137 on M cells in vivo might interact with CD 137 L expressed by B cells. Accordingly, while CD 137 -deficient mice produced UEA- 1 + <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> progenitors in nasopharyngeal associated lymphoid tissue and Peyer’s patch epithelium, they showed an abnormal morphology, including the absence of basolateral B cell pockets. More important, CD 137 -deficient nasopharyngeal associated lymphoid tissue M cells were defective in microparticle transcytosis. Bone marrow irradiation chimeras confirmed that while induction of UEA- 1 + putative <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> precursors was not CD 137 -dependent, full <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> transcytosis function required expression of CD 137 by radioresistant stromal cells {{as well as by}} bone marrow-derived cells. These results are consistent with a two-step model of <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, with initial CD 137 -independent commitment to the <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> lineage followed by a CD 137 -CD 137 L interaction of M cells with CD 137 -activated B lymphocytes or dendritic cells for functional maturation...|$|E
40|$|M {{cells are}} {{specialized}} epithelial cells, which assist immune surveillance by transcytosis of particles and antigens to underlying lymphoid tissues. So far, three <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> phenotypes {{have been identified}} in airways and intestines. However, the mechanism of <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation is poorly understood, as well as the relationships between different <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> subtypes. To better understand these questions, we treated human (Caco- 2 BBe) and rodent (IEC- 6) intestinal epithelial cell lines with lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and TNF receptor (TNFR) agonists. Treated cells were then studied for regulation of genes previously shown to associate with <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> and Follicle-Associated Epithelium (FAE). Moreover, we used a reporter transgenic mouse strain to follow the development of <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> subsets in vivo, and examined the de novo induction of M cells by cholera toxin (CT). We found that LTbetaR and TNFR agonists can induce transcription of FAE specific genes (Ccl 20 and Lamb 3) as well as rodent <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> specific genes such as Sgne- 1 /Scg 5, Cldn 4, and Gp 2 in Caco 2 -BBe cells and IEC- 6 cells. These cytokines have distinct but complementary effects; TNFR agonists induced FAE specific genes, while the LTbetaR agonist induces <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> specific genes. The combination of these cytokines showed additive induction of the FAE-associated Ccl 20, Lamb 3 and a surprisingly the induction of CD 137 /Tnfrsf 9. Functionally, cytokine treatment led to both the reorganization of microvilli as well as Claudin- 4 redistribution. Moreover, {{with the help of the}} reporter transgenic mouse model, we have found that M cells overlying intestinal Peyer's patches (PP) and Nasal Associated Lymphoid Tissue (NALT) have distinct developmental origins, yet show convergent phenotypes, such as expression of a PGRP-S reporter in vivo. By contrast, though PP and Villous M cells are derived from intestinal crypt stem cells, their phenotypes are clearly distinct. Thus, PP M cells form an intimate M cell-dendritic cell functional unit while Villous M cells do not engage with underlying DC. Though B lymphocytes are thought to play a critical role in <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> function by forming a basolateral pocket and possibly signaling through CD 137, initial commitment to <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> lineages is B lymphocyte and CD 137 independent. In addition, CT can causes rapid induction of new M cells in the airway and intestines without cell division, suggesting transdifferentiation from mature epithelial cells. CT-induced M cells show the local <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> phenotype without evidence for mixed phenotypes. Finally, <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> phenotypes display distinct capabilities; thus, intestinal PP M cells were more efficient than Villous M cells in the uptake of Salmonella. Our studies show that LTbetaR and TNFR agonists induce many features associated with <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, and suggest that these agonists may be involved in secondary lymphoid tissue development in vivo. Additionally, we confirmed that the differentiation of M cells in vivo toward strictly defined phenotypic subsets, and is consistent with functional specialization...|$|E
40|$|In vitro <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> models, {{consisting}} of co-cultures of Caco- 2 cells and lymphoid cells, were developed and examined to observe bacterial transport. However, under our experimental conditions, the differentiation of Caco- 2 cells into M cell-like cells {{could not be}} induced efficiently. To obtain a functionally stable <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> model based on human cells, C 2 BBe 1 cells were screened and co-cultured with human Raji cells. In our co-cultures, increased sialyl Lewis A antigen expression and decreased Ulex europeaus agglutinin 1 binding were observed. Regarding the functional properties of the model, microsphere and lactic acid bacteria transport across the C 2 BBe 1 co-cultures were increased compared with the levels seen in monocultures. The C 2 BBe 1 monolayers that were co-cultured with Raji cells exhibited some <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> features; therefore, we consider our <b>M</b> <b>cell</b> model to be useful for investigating the interactions of bacteria with M cells. Key words: M cell; C 2 BBe 1; Raji; co-cultur...|$|E
40|$|<b>M</b> <b>cells</b> {{located in}} the follicle-associated {{epithelium}} of Peyer's patches (PP) are shown to be the principal sites for the sampling of gut luminal antigens. Thus, PP have long been considered the gatekeepers of the mucosal immune system. Here, we report a distinct gateway for the uptake of gut bacteria: clusters of non-follicle-associated epithelium-associated Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA) - 1 + cells, which we have designated intestinal villous <b>M</b> <b>cells.</b> Interestingly, villous <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> are developed in various PP [or gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) ]-null mice, such as in utero lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR) -Ig-treated, lymphotoxin α (LTα) -/-, tumor necrosis factor/LTα-/-, and inhibition of differentiation 2 (Id 2) -/- mice. Intestinal villous <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> have been observed to take up GFP-expressing Salmonella, Yersinia, and Escherichia coli-expressing invasin, as well as gut bacterial antigen for subsequent induction of antigen-specific immune responses. Thus, the identified villous <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> could be an alternative and PP-independent gateway for the induction of antigen-specific immune responses {{by means of the}} mucosal compartment...|$|R
40|$|It is {{essential}} to investigate the apical surface properties of both <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> and dome enterocytes to understand the mechanisms involved in the binding of pathogens to <b>M</b> <b>cells.</b> In rabbit appendix tissue, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) highlight differences between <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> (MAb 58) and dome enterocytes (MAb 214). Such antibodies ultimately recognized intestinal mucin-related epitopes. To further characterize these differences, the labeling patterns obtained with these MAbs were compared to those obtained with other antibodies to intestinal mucins on dissected domes from all gut-associated lymphoid tissues. A glycoprotein recognized by MAb 58 was purified on a CsCl isopycnic density gradient and microsequenced, and its mRNA expression was localized by in situ hybridization. It was identified as the rabbit homologue of human Muc 2, i. e., the major mucin secreted in intestine tissue. Two other Muc 2 carbohydrate epitopes were also expressed on <b>M</b> <b>cells,</b> although Muc 2 mRNA was not detected. All results indicated that <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> express, on their apical membrane, glycoconjugates bearing at least three glycosidic epitopes from Muc 2. MAb 214 and MAb 6 G 2, which recognized a partially characterized mucin expressed on dome enterocytes, were negative markers for <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> in rabbit gut-associated lymphoid tissues. We propose that the presence, {{on the surface of}} <b>M</b> <b>cells,</b> of carbohydrates also expressed on Muc 2, together with the absence of an enterocyte-associated mucin, could favor pathogen attachment and accessibility to the M-cell luminal membrane...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{attachment}} and ingestion of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis by cultured epithelial cells requires {{the expression of}} a fibronectin (FN) attachment protein homologue (FAP-P) which mediates FN binding by M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Invasion of Peyer's patches by M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis occurs through <b>M</b> <b>cells,</b> which, unlike other intestinal epithelial cells, express integrins on their luminal faces. We sought to determine if the interaction between FAP-P of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis and soluble FN enabled targeting and invasion of <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> by <b>M.</b> avium subsp. paratuberculosis in vivo via these surface integrins. Wild-type and antisense FAP-P mutant M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains were injected alone or coinjected with blocking peptides or antibodies into murine gut loops, and immunofluorescence microscopy was performed to assess targeting and invasion of <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> by <b>M.</b> avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Nonopsonized M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis preferentially invaded <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> in murine gut loops. M-cell invasion was enhanced 2. 6 -fold when M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was pretreated with FN. Invasion of <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> by the antisense FAP-P mutant of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was reduced by 77 to 90 % relative to that observed for the control strains. Peptides corresponding to the RGD and synergy site integrin recognition regions of FN blocked M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis invasion of <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> by 75 and 45 %, respectively, whereas the connecting segment 1 peptide was noninhibitory. Antibodies against the α 5, αV, β 1, and β 3 integrin subunits inhibited M-cell invasion by 52 to 73 %. The results indicate that targeting and invasion of <b>M</b> <b>cells</b> by <b>M.</b> avium subsp. paratuberculosis in vivo is mediated primarily by the formation of an FN bridge formed between FAP-P of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis and integrins on <b>M</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
