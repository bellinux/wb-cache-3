However, investigations on the prevalence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> in patients with bipolar disorder are still surprisingly rare. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze comorbidity of bipolar disorder and <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and the association of treatment with antipsychotics and mood stabilizers with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> as well as to point out the necessity of appropriate preventive measures and treatment of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> in patient with bipolar disorder.

40|$|Background: Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death worldwide. There are several factors that can {{increase}} a person's risk of developing CVD, and many of these may occur simultaneously. A clustering of risk factors for CVD can be defined as <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Previous studies have shown an intergenerational association for single risk factors for CVD between parents and offspring, but few studies have examined intergenerational association of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Moreover, there is evidence that physical activity can decreased the risk of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> but whether physical activity can modify an intergenerational association in <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> is not known. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to prospectively examine the association between parental <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> and the risk of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> in their adult offspring. We will also examine the independent effect of offspring physical activity, on risk of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> as well as the possible modifying role physical activity may have on any intergenerational associations in <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Methods: We used data on 7064 father-offspring and 9874 mother-offspring pairs from the two latest survey from the HUNT Study in Norway (HUNT 2 1995 - 97 and HUNT 3 2006 - 08) linked with the Family registry at Statistics Norway. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratio (OR) as an estimate of relative risk for <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> in offspring, according to <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> in their parents, as well as independent and possible modifying effects of offspring physical activity level. All associations were adjusted for offspring age, gender, smoking status and education level. Results: During the follow-up period, 2684 offspring developed <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> There was a positive association between parental <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> and offspring risk of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> (adjusted OR= 1. 71 (95 % CI: 1. 51 - 1. 93), if the mother had <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and adjusted OR= 1. 50 (95 % CI: 1. 30 - 1. 72), if father had <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome).</b> Offspring physical activity was inversely associated with risk of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> (adjusted OR= 0. 92 (95 % CI: 0. 81 - 1. 03), for low level of physical activity, and adjusted OR= 0. 56 (95 % CI: 0. 47 - 0. 67) for high level of physical activity). However, stratified analyses and tests for interaction showed no modifying effect of physical activity on the intergenerational association of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Conclusion: This study shows that there is an intergenerational association in <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> between parents and their adult offspring. Physical activity can reduce the risk of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> but do not modify the intergenerational association in risk of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Naturally, {{since the}} <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{disorder}} of energy distribution and storage, fat accumulation explains {{for a significant}} proportion of cardiovascular risk.

When left untreated, it signifi-cantly {{increases the risk of}} diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested that hypogonadism may be an additional component of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> This has potential implications for the treatment of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> with testosterone. We reviewed the avail-able literature on <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> and hypogonadism with a particular focus on testosterone therapy. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive MEDLINE review of the world literature from 1988 to 2004 on hypogonadism, testosterone and <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was performed. Results: Observational data suggest that <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> is strongly associated with hypogonadism in men. Multiple interventional studies have shown that exogenous testosterone has a favorable impact on body mass, insulin secretion and sensitivity, lipid profile and blood pressure, which are the parameters most often disturbed in <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Conclusions: Hypogonadism is likely a fundamental component of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Tes-tosterone therapy may not only treat hypogonadism, but may also have tremendous potential to slow or halt the progression from <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> to overt diabetes or cardiovascular disease via beneficial effects on insulin regulation, lipid profile and blood pressure. Furthermore, the use of testosterone to treat <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> may also lead to the prevention of urological complications commonly associated with these chronic disease states, such as neurogenic bladder and erectile dysfunction. Physicians must be mindful to evaluate hypogonadism in all men diagnosed with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> as well as <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> in all men diagnosed with hypogonadism.

This study evaluated markers of inflammation in black CAD patients, {{some of whom had}} <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Methods: <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was defined according to International Diabetes Federation criteria. Inflammatory markers leptin, adiponectin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured in 40 patients and 20 control subjects. Results: <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was present in 23 patients and absent in 17 patients. Leptin was the only significantly higher marker in patients with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> compared to patients without <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> (P < 0. 01). Leptin was higher in women than men (P < 0. 01) and higher in both genders with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> (P < 0. 03 and P < 0. 04, respectively). Leptin levels rose significantly with increasing <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> criteria (P < 0. 05). hs-CRP concentrations were elevated in both patient groups. Positive correlations were found between leptin and body mass index (BMI) (r = 0. 7107; P < 0. 0001), waist circumference (WC) (r = 0. 4981; P < 0. 002), and hs-CRP (r = 0. 3886; P < 0. 02). Conclusions: Leptin differentiated between CAD patients with and without <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> and determined <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> status in women and men. Leptin was the only marker that increased with additional <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> criteria. Elevated hs-CRP concentrations may indicate a low-grade inflammatory state in CAD patients.

40|$|Although the {{individual}} {{components of the}} <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> are clearly associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), we wanted to quantify the increased prevalence of CHD among people with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) was used to categorize adults over 50 years of age by presence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> (National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP] definition) with or without diabetes. Demographic and risk factor information was deter-mined for each group, {{as well as the}} proportion of each group meeting specific criteria for <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The prevalence of CHD for each group was then deter-mined. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> is very common, with 44 % of the U.

Older Americans over 50 years of age without <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> regardless of diabetes status had the lowest CHD prevalence (8. 7 % without diabetes, 7. 5 % with diabetes). Compared with those with metabolic syn-drome, people with diabetes without metabolic syn-drome did not have an increase in CHD prevalence. Those with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> without diabetes had higher CHD prevalence (13. 9 %), and those with both <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> and diabetes had the highest prev-alence of CHD (19. 2 %) compared with those with nei-ther. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was a significant univariate predictor of prevalent CHD (OR 2. 07, 95 % CI 1. 66 – 2. 59).

This positive association of parity and gravidity with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was confined to pre-menopausal women (Ptrend < 0. 01). Among the components of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> only high blood pressure showed positive association with parity and gravidity (Ptrend = 0. 01 and < 0. 001). Neither Parity nor gravidity was appreciably associated with other components of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> ConclusionsMulti parity or gravidity may be a risk factor for <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{reaches its}} highest {{prevalence}} in the elderly, and {{evidence suggests that}} <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> could be an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment. The aims {{of this study were}} to detect whether patients with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> have lower cognition and to investigate whether there is a relationship with cognition and single <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> components. Methods: We assessed fasting blood glucose (FBG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and anthropometric measurements. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was diagnosed according to National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criteria. The population sample was divided into two groups according to the presence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Cognitive function was investigated through the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results: We enrolled 159 elderly subjects (mean age, 69. 8 ± 4. 8 years). Seventy had <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> subjects had higher hsCRP values (P< 0. 0001) and lower MMSE scores (P< 0. 0001) than those without <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> MMSE scores were significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI), hsCRP, <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> the number of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> components, and each of them. However, at multivariate regression analysis, only fasting blood glucose [FBG; B=- 0. 046; 95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 066 to - 0. 028; P< 0. 0001] and the number of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> components (B=- 0. 317; 95 % CI - 0. 572 to - 0. 010; P= 0. 042) were found to be independent predictors of lower MMSE scores. Conclusion: We found that subjects with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> have lower MMSE scores than those without, even without symptomatic cognitive impairment, and that the number of metabolic abnormalities is independently associated to lower MMSE scores. We suggest that these patients should always undergo cognitive screening to prevent more severe outcomes...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionMetabolic {{syndrome}} is increasing among adolescents. We examined {{the utility of}} body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference to identify <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> in adolescent girls. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 185 predominantly African American girls who were a median age of 14 years. Participants were designated as having <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> if they met criteria for 3 of 5 variables: 1) high blood pressure, 2) low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, 3) high fasting blood glucose level, 4) high waist circumference, and 5) high triglyceride level. We predicted {{the likelihood of the}} presence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> by using previously established cutpoints of BMI and waist circumference. We used stepwise regression analysis to determine whether anthropometric measurements significantly predicted <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> ResultsOf total participants, 18 % met the criteria for <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> BMI for 118 (64 %) participants was above the cutpoint. Of these participants, 25 % met the criteria for <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> whereas only 4 % of participants with a BMI below the cutpoint met the criteria for <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> (P <. 001). Girls with a BMI above the cutpoint were more likely than girls with a BMI below the cutpoint to have <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> (P =. 002). The waist circumference for 104 (56 %) participants was above the cutpoint. Of these participants, 28 % met the criteria for <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> whereas only 1 % of participants with a waist circumference below the cutpoint met the criteria for <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> (P <. 001). Girls with a waist circumference above the cutpoint were more likely than girls with a waist circumference below the cutpoint to have <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> (P =. 002). Stepwise regression showed that only waist circumference significantly predicted <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> ConclusionBoth anthropometric measures were useful screening tools to identify <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Waist circumference was a better predictor of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> than was BMI in our study sample of predominantly African American female adolescents living in an urban area...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{commonly}} associated with cardiovascular diseases and psychiatric mental illness. Hence, we aimed to assess the <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> among severe mental illness (SMI). Materials and Methods: The study included 267 patients who were referred to the psychiatric unit at 5 th Azar Education Hospital of Golestan University of Medical Sciences in Gorgan, Iran. Results: The mean waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride and fasting blood glucose levels were significantly higher in the SMI with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> but the high density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol was significantly lower. The prevalence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> in SMI patients was 20. 60. There were {{significant differences in the}} mean of waist circumference, systolic (except for women) and diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol and fasting blood glucose in men and women with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> when compared with subjects without <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The prevalence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> in SMI women was higher than men. The most age distribution was in range of 30 - 39 years old. The most prevalence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was in age groups 50 - 59 years old. The prevalence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was increased from 30 to 59 years old. Conclusion: The prevalence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> in patients with SMI in Gorgan is almost similar to those observed in Asian countries. The prevalence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was lower than western countries. These observations may be due to cultural differences in the region. It should be mention that the families of mental illness subjects in our country believe that their patients must be cared better than people without mental illness. These findings {{of this study suggest that}} mental illness patients are at risk of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> According to our results, risk factors such as age and gender differences may play an important role in the presence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> In our country, women do less physical activity than men; therefore, the incidence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> is higher among women. © 2016 Journal of Natural Science, Biology and Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{associated}} with a high risk of cardiovascular disease in hypertension. We evaluated whether <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is associated}} with early vascular alterations, such as increased peripheral wave reflections and endothelial dysfunction, in untreated essential hypertensive patients. METHODS: Augmentation index and pulse wave velocity were determined with applanation tonometry in 391 untreated hypertensive patients and 166 controls. Endothelium-dependent response was assessed as flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was defined according to the latest National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment panel III. RESULTS: Hypertensive patients showed significantly (P < 0. 001) increased augmentation index and central pulse wave velocity, as well as reduced flow-mediated dilation, compared with controls. No further impairment in augmentation index or flow-mediated dilation was observed between patients with or without the <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> components and with increasing number of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Age and systolic blood pressure, but no other single factor of the <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> resulted as significant predictors of augmentation index and flow-mediated dilation. Female gender was associated with increased augmentation index (P < 0. 05) {{in the presence of the}} <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Central pulse wave velocity was selectively impaired by <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> in both genders. Finally, reactive hyperemia was reduced in patients with the <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> and decreased significantly with the increasing number of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In untreated hypertensive patients, the presence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which selectively impairs central pulse wave velocity, does not account for a further deterioration of peripheral wave reflection and conduit artery endothelial function. Our results suggest that blood pressure, age and gender are important determinants of peripheral vascular structural and functional parameters in these subjects, irrespective of the <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: To examine {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD) mortality risk in men with diabetes only, <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> only and concurrent <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> and diabetes. Research design and methods: We examined CVD mortality risk by <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> and diabetes status in {{men from the}} Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study (mean age [SD]: 45. 1 [10. 2] years). Participants were categorized as having neither diabetes nor <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> (n= 23, 770), <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> only (n= 8, 780), diabetes only (n= 532) or both (n= 1, 097). The mean duration of follow-up was 14. 6 (7. 0) years {{with a total of}} 483, 079 man-years of exposure and 1, 085 CVD deaths. Results: Age, examination year and smoking adjusted CVD death rates (per 1, 000 man-years) in men with neither <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> nor diabetes, <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> only, diabetes only, and both were 1. 9, 3. 3, 5. 5 and 6. 5, respectively. CVD mortality was higher in men with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> only (HR [95 % CI]: 1. 8 [1. 5, 2. 0]), diabetes only (2. 9 [2. 1, 4. 0]), and both (3. 4 [2. 8, 4. 2]) compared to men with neither. The presence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was not associated (1. 2 [0. 8, 1. 7]) with higher CVD mortality risk in individuals with diabetes. In contrast, the presence of diabetes substantially increased (2. 1 [1. 7, 2. 6]) CVD mortality risk in individuals with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Conclusions: The presence of diabetes was associated with a 3 -fold higher CVD mortality risk, and <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> status did not modify this risk. Our findings support that physicians should be aggressive in utilizing CVD risk reducing therapies in all diabetic patients regardless of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> status...|$|R

We tested the cross-sectional associations between <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> and nine inflammatory markers. Methods We measured C-reactive protein, CD 40 ligand, interleukin- 6, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1, osteoprotegerin, P-selectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and tumor necrosis factor receptor- 2 in 2570 Framingham Offspring Study participants free of diabetes and cardiovascular disease at examination 7. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was defined by National Cholesterol Education Program criteria. We performed multivariable linear regressions for each biomarker with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> as the exposure adjusting for age, sex, smoking, aspirin use, and hormone replacement. We subsequently added to the models components of the <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> as continuous traits plus lipid lowering and hypertension treatments. We considered P [*] Results <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was present in 984 (38 %) participants and was statistically significantly associated with each biomarker (all P[*] [*] 0. 02) except osteoprotegerin. After adjusting for its component variables, the <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was associated only with P-selectin (1. 06 fold higher in <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> 95 % CI 1. 02, 1. 10, p[*]=[*] 0. 005). Conclusions <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> was associated with multiple inflammatory biomarkers. However, adjusting for each of its components eliminated the association with most inflammatory markers, except P-selectin.

40|$|Background: The American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLBI), {{revising}} the National Cholesterol Evaluation Program for Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III), and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have proposed definitions of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> that {{take into account}} waist circumference thresholds according to ethnicity. In this study we estimated the prevalence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> in a Japanese-Brazilian population using NCEP definitions for Westerners (NCEPwe) and Asians (NCEPas), and IDF for Japanese (IDF). Methods: A total of 650 Japanese-Brazilians living in a developed Brazilian city and aged 30 - 88 years were included. Results: <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> prevalence according to NCEPwe, NCEPas, and IDF was, respectively, 46. 5 %, 56. 5 %, and 48. 3 %. Only 43. 5 % of subjects did not have <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{by any of the}} 3 definitions, and 38. 3 % fulfilled <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> criteria for all 3 definitions. Ten percent of subjects were positive for <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> based on NCEPas and IDF, but not for NCEPwe. Because IDF requires abdominal obesity as a criterion, the frequency of subjects without <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> according to IDF, but with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> by NCEPwe and NCEPas was 8. 2 %. Conclusions: Independent of the <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> definition, Japanese-Brazilians present an elevated <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> prevalence, which was higher when using NCEP criteria for Asians, followed by the IDF definition for Japanese.
