50|$|Iron {{deficiency}} can {{be avoided}} by choosing appropriate soil for the growing conditions (e.g., avoid growing acid loving plants on lime soils), or by adding well-rotted manure or compost. If iron deficit chlorosis is suspected then check the pH of the soil with an appropriate test kit or instrument. Take a soil sample at surface and at depth. If the pH is over seven then consider soil remediation that will lower the pH toward the 6.5 - 7 range. Remediation includes: i) adding compost, <b>manure,</b> <b>peat</b> or similar organic matter (warning. Some retail blends of manure and compost have pH in the range 7 - 8 because of added lime. Read the MSDS if available. Beware of herbicide residues in manure. Source manure from a certified organic source.) ii) applying Ammonium Sulphate as a Nitrogen fertilizer (acidifying fertilizer due to decomposition of ammonium ion to nitrate in the soil and root zone) iii) applying elemental Sulphur to the soil (oxidizes {{over the course of}} months to produce sulphate/sulphite and lower pH). Note: adding acid directly e.g. sulphuric/hydrochloric/citric acid is dangerous as you may mobilize metal ions in the soil that are toxic and otherwise bound. Iron can be made available immediately to the plant by the use of iron sulphate or iron chelate compounds. Two common iron chelates are Fe EDTA and Fe EDDHA. Iron sulphate (Iron(II)_sulfate) and iron EDTA are only useful in soil up to PH 7.1 but they {{can be used as a}} foliar spray (Foliar_feeding). Iron EDDHA is useful up to PH 9 (highly alkaline) but must be applied to the soil and in the evening to avoid photodegradation. EDTA in the soil may mobilize Lead, EDDHA does not appear to.|$|E

40|$|The {{difficulties}} in using complicated models of carbon mineralization {{and the poor}} performance of simple ones call for new models that are simple in use and robust in performance. We have developed {{a model for the}} mineralization of carbon from experimental data in which the organic matter is treated as a single component. The logarithm of the average relative mineralization rate, K, or rate constant, of a substrate considered as a whole was found to be linearly related to the logarithm of time, t, provided prevailing soil conditions remained unchanged. The equation is: logK = logR - S logt, or K = R t-S, in which R (dimension tS - 1) represents K at t = 1, and S (dimensionless, 1 ≥ S ≥ 0) {{is a measure of the}} rate at which K decreases over time, also called the speed of 'ageing' of the substrate. The quantity of the remaining substrate, Yt, is calculated by Yt = Y 0 exp(-Rt 1 - S), where Y 0 is the initial quantity of the substrate. The actual relative mineralization rate, k, at time t is proportional to K, according to k = (1 - S) K. The model was tested against an assembly of 136 sets of data collected from trials conducted in 14 countries all over the world.

40|$|Volatilization {{of ammonia}} (NH 3) from animal manure {{is a major}} pathway for {{nitrogen}} (N) losses that cause eutrophication, acidification, and other environmental hazards. In this study, the effect of alternative techniques of manure treatment (aeration, separation, addition of peat) and application (broadcast spreading, band spreading, injection, incorporation by harrowing) on NH 3 emissions {{in the field and}} N uptake by ley or cereals was studied. The effect of a mixture of slurry and peat on soil properties was also investigated. The aim {{of this study was to}} find ways to improve the utilization of manure N and reduce its release to the environment. Injection into the soil or incorporation by harrowing clearly reduced NH 3 volatilization from slurry more than did the surface application onto a smaller area by band spreading or reduction of the dry matter of slurry by aeration or separation. Surface application showed low NH 3 volatilization, when pig slurry was applied to tilled bare clay soil or to spring wheat stands in early growth stages. Apparently, the properties of both slurry and soil enabled the rapid infiltration and absorption of slurry and its ammoniacal N by the soil. On ley, however, surface-applied cattle slurry lost about half of its ammoniacal N. The volatilization of NH 3 from surface-applied <b>peat</b> <b>manure</b> was slow, but proceeded over a long period of time. After rain or irrigation, the <b>peat</b> <b>manure</b> layer on the soil surface retarded evaporation. Incorporation was less important for the fertilizer effect of <b>peat</b> <b>manure</b> than for pig slurry, but both manures were more effective when incorporated. <b>Peat</b> <b>manure</b> applications increase soil organic matter content and aggregate stability. Stubble mulch tillage hastens the effect in surface soil compared with ploughing. The apparent recovery of ammoniacal manure N in crop yield was higher with injection and incorporation than with surface applications. This was the case for leys as well as for spring cereals, even though NH 3 losses from manures applied to cereals were relatively low with surface applications as well. The ammoniacal N of surface-applied slurry was obviously adsorbed by the very surface soil and remained mostly unavailable to plants roots in the dry soil. Supplementing manures with inorganic fertilizer N, which adds plant-available N to the soil at the start of growth, increased the overall recovery of applied N in crop yields...|$|R

Taxonomists and morphologists have long argued about the proper classification and anatomical interpretation of these, most modified of higher plants, while physiologists from the time of Sachs have seen in Lemna and Spirodela a type of plant peculiarly suited for experimental investigations in the field of nutrition. This has been because of their small size and aquatic habit which make them ideal for culture in nutrient solution. In recent times there has been considerable controversy over the question as to whether organic <b>manures,</b> humus, <b>peat,</b> and soil supply small amounts of organic materials which promote the growth of green plants. Are the beneficial effects often observed upon treatment with these substances simply the result of correcting recognized or unrecognized inorganic deficiencies, or are they the result of accessory growth factors? In undertaking to answer this question, Spirodela polyrrhiza (L.) Schleid. was chosen as the test plant since careful control of its growth environment is readily achieved. The possibility of freeing the plants of microorganisms and employing sterile culture technique make its use particularly desirable in a study concerned with the effects of organic materials.

The {{aim of this}} paper is to describe basic structure of organic fertilizer (and growing media) evaluation model to present the model example by comparison of different manures as well as example of using plant growth experiment for calculating impact of pH and EC of growing media on lettuce plant growth. The basic structure of the model includes selection of quality indicators, interpretations of indicators value, and integration of interpreted values into new indexes. The first step includes data input and selection of available data as a basic or additional indicators depending on possible use as fertilizer or growing media. The second part of the model uses inputs for calculation of derived quality indicators. The third step integrates values into three new indexes: fertilizer, growing media, and environmental index. All three indexes are calculated on the basis of three different groups of indicators: basic value indicators, additional value indicators and limiting factors. The possible range of indexes values is 0 - 10, where range 0 - 3 means low, 3 - 7 medium and 7 - 10 high quality. Comparing fresh and composted manures, higher fertilizer and environmental indexes were determined for composted manures, and the highest fertilizer index was determined for composted pig manure (9. 6) whereas the lowest for fresh cattle manure (3. 2). Composted manures had high environmental index (6. 0 - 10) for conventional agriculture, but some had no value (environmental index = 0) for organic agriculture because of too high zinc, copper or cadmium concentrations. Growing media indexes were determined according to their impact on lettuce growth. Growing media with different pH and EC resulted in very significant impacts on height, dry matter mass and leaf area of lettuce seedlings. The highest lettuce seedlings with highest mass and leaf area are produced using growing media with pH close to 6 and with EC lower than 2 dSm- 1. It could be concluded that conductivity approx. 3 dSm- 1 has inhibitory effect on lettuce if pH is about 7 or higher. The computer model shows that raising pH and EC resulted in decreasing growth which could be expressed as increasing stress index. The lettuce height as a function of pH and EC is incorporated into the model as stress function showing increase of lettuce height by lowering EC from 4 to 1 dSm- 1 or pH from 7. 4 to 6.

The paper present the investigations carried out between 2005 - 2008 period at Research Institute for Fruit Growing Pitesti-Maracineni, regarding the quantitative and qualitative traits of fruits, belonging to some high bush blueberry cultivars recently released in Romania. The plants were grown on 3 planting substrates (peat 50 % + <b>manure</b> 50 %; <b>peat</b> 50 % + manure 50 % + 40 g sulphur; litter 100 % (controls) administrated in the planting hole). We find that, during the experimentation period the yields, registered very significant differences (248 %) on the substrates containing peat. The fruit size was 0. 5 times higher comparatively with the control...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of pelleted cow <b>manure</b> (PCM), <b>peat,</b> {{municipal solid waste}} compost (MSWC), wet olive husk compost (WOHC) and green waste compost (GWC) on soil biochemical activity, antioxidant capacity (trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC)) {{and the level of}} soil organic matter was evaluated in a short-term laboratory study. Peat was the most acidifying material, followed by GWC and PCM, reflecting the acidic characteristics of the compounds present in the aqueous and alkaline extracts of the amendments. Organic materials caused a marked increase of total and water-soluble organic carbon, total N, water- and alkali-soluble phenols in soil, with values generally reflecting the amount of organic matter present in the amendments. The breakdown percentage of C added expressed as CO 2 -C evolution for PCM was considerably the highest (18 %) and for WOHC was considerably the lowest. The water-soluble organic carbon present in the amendments and soil total N acted as controllers of the rate of decomposition of organic C in soil. The highest TEAC was in peat soil, with 583. 0 mM g− 1, followed by PCM soil (450. 2 mM g− 1), while soils treated with compost had quite similar values (about 230 mM g− 1). TEAC was strictly correlated with both alkali- and water-soluble phenols and water-soluble organic carbon. The level of ATP in PCM soil at the 60 th day of incubation suggests that the PCM is the most effective amendment for increasing the activity of microbial biomass in soil...|$|R
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{promoters}} for a canal was Richard Prat, who was {{a lawyer}} in Glastonbury, had been the town clerk since 1813, and held several important offices in the town. He saw the canal {{as a way to}} halt the economic downturn in the town and its drainage problems, and called a meeting in August 1825, at which a firm plan was formulated. Richard Hammett, a local man from Street, was commissioned to conduct a survey of the route in 1826. Hammett had experience of building a <b>manure</b> canal through <b>peat</b> heathland. He considered two main routes; the first followed the course of the River Brue, but was rejected on the grounds of engineering costs, and the interference with its drainage function. The second route followed the South Drain, which had been newly constructed following floods in 1794, to connect with the River Brue near Cripps Bridge, and to re-use the old course of that River at Highbridge to create a basin.|$|R
40|$|Manure {{constitutes}} a nutrient resource {{that should be}} efficiently recycled in agriculture. We assessed the nutrient cycling properties of three bedding materials (peat, wood shavings and pelleted straw) in horse manure by comparing their compostability, ability to retain nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) under rainfall and capacity to release N when mixed with soil. Manure with pelleted straw bedding had superior composting characteristics as it lost half of its dry mass, reached temperatures > 60  °C and ended up having a carbon (C) to N (C:N) ratio of < 15. In percolated water, 4 – 11 % of total manure N and 5 – 23 % of total manure P was leached during a 2 h 15 min event of artificial rainfall. <b>Peat</b> <b>manure</b> was most susceptible to P loss. In all fresh manures, C:N ratio exceeded 30, which led to net N immobilization in soil. Composting decreased the C:N leading to a slight positive or an insignificant fertilizer effect...|$|R
40|$|Two depths (10 and 20 cm) of {{floating}} sphagnum peat covers {{were compared to}} uncovered swine slurries in storage, as a nitrogen conservation method. The test was repeated over three consecutive summers. Following a nitrogen mass balance analysis, for the manure stored in tanks of limited diameter but full depth, the slurries covered with the two depths of peat conserved 60 % and 76 % of their nitrogen, while that uncovered conserved only 54 %. The sphagnum <b>peat</b> reduced <b>manure</b> evaporation during storage and helped conserve nitrogen during the tank mixing operation. A drying temperature of 105 $ sp circ$C gave the sphagnum peat moss the most hydrophobicity to keep it floating over liquid <b>manures.</b> The sphagnum <b>peat</b> conserved nitrogen by absorbing the manure moisture rather than by fixing the volatilized ammonia. Applied to rye grass, the <b>peat</b> treated <b>manure</b> improved the nitrogen uptake efficiency by 140 190 % and 190 % to 340 %, as opposed to untreated manure and chemical fertilizers, respectively...|$|R

40|$|A {{consecutive}} extraction {{method was}} developed which allows {{to determine the}} total amount of water soluble phosphorus in soil. For that, soil was shaken with deionized water, which was removed and replaced after one hour; this procedure was repeated ten times. The concentrations measured at each extraction step allow to quantify desorption of total water soluble phosphorus. Seven soils of the Ultuna long term soil organic matter experiment, Sweden, were used to test the method. Two additional soils from a horse paddock were used for method development. Soils treated with farmyard manure and sewage sludge showed the highest release of total water soluble phosphorus, whereas calcium nitrate and ammonium sulfate showed the lowest. Fallow, green <b>manure</b> and <b>peat</b> treatments showed intermediate release. The amount of total water soluble phosphorus was controlled by pH, total P and P-AL. The increase in potentially releasable water soluble P is about 20 per cent of total P but 55 per cent of P-AL in average among all soils tested. Data were compared with an earlier phosphorus fractionation of four of the soils used showing that all resin P and part of sodium bicarbonate P was released by consecutive extraction with water. The relative decline in consecutive P release was inversely related to the P quantity/intensity ratio. The estimation of total water soluble phosphorus obtained by the method showed that the actual availability of P in soil to plants seems not to be limited by chemical binding and release of P to the soil solution, but by the ability of plants to obtain P from the soil solution...|$|R
