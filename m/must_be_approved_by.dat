In November 2008, for the first time, the Smithsonian opened a board meeting to the public. Clough has made {{efforts to improve the}} Smithsonian's facilities and long-term planning, as well as plans to reorganize and cut back on staff and budget. In February 2012, Clough's travel expenses were probed by senator Charles E.

5|$|The NCTA {{negotiated}} with Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia {{for the formation}} of a new regional entity. The authority was created by an interstate compact, a special type of contract or agreement between one or more states. Pursuant to the Compact Clause of the U.S. Constitution, any such compact <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> Congress. After the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact was approved by the Maryland General Assembly in 1965, and passed through the Virginia General Assembly and Congress in 1966, WMATA was founded on February 20, 1967.|$|E

5|$|The {{mayor and}} council set local taxes and a budget, which <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> Congress. The Government Accountability Office and other analysts have {{estimated}} that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the District's local budget of anywhere between $470million and over $1billion per year. Congress typically provides additional grants for federal programs such as Medicaid and {{the operation of the}} local justice system; however, analysts claim that the payments do not fully resolve the imbalance.|$|E
5|$|First, the {{assigned}} herald develops a written description based on {{consultation with the}} petitioner.

At all stages the documents <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> both the petitioner and the Chief Herald. The final step is to prepare the letters patent, the official notice of an award of arms, which includes a drawing of the armorial bearings and the accompanying legal text and explanation of {{the symbolism of the}} bearings.

He can declare war and peace, ratify laws and treaties, convene and close legislative sessions, call and postpone elections, dismiss the government and dissolve the parliament.

After a bill is proposed by the government, it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the House of Representatives then the Senate, and becomes law after being ratified by the king. A royal veto on legislation can be overridden by a two-thirds vote in both houses. The parliament also has the right of interpellation.|$|E

5|$|The {{role of the}} {{president}} of Slovenia is mainly ceremonial. One of {{the president}}'s duties is to nominate the Prime Minister, after consulting with political groups represented in the National Assembly. The president also proposes candidates for various state offices, as well as judicial appointments to the Constitutional and Supreme Court, which <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the National Assembly. In rare circumstances, the president possesses the power to pass laws and dissolve the National Assembly. The President is also the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. Unlike the majority of the government, which is chosen by the National Assembly and elected through proportional representation, the president is directly elected by the majority of Slovenian voters.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{democratic}} {{structures and}} methods are developing {{there is not}} such a mirror in creating a European civil society. The Treaty of Lisbon may go some way to resolving the deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president. An alternative viewpoint is that electoral pressures undermine the Commission's role as an independent regulator, considering it akin with institutions such as independent central banks which deal with technical areas of policy. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.|$|E
5|$|PRSA is {{organized}} as a 501(c)(6) not-for-profit organization and {{governed by a}} set of bylaws. A Chair is nominated each year and elected based on a vote of the Leadership Assembly.

A Board of Directors can propose membership fee changes that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the assembly. The board has the authority to create or dissolve task forces and committees as well as revoke or reward membership status. PRSA's Board of Ethics and Professional Standards and the Universal Accreditation Board make recommendations on the code of conduct and accreditation programs respectively. PRSA has more than 100 chapters in ten districts, 300 student chapters and 14 interest groups.|$|E

5|$|To {{amend the}} Constitution, {{one of two}} things must happen before the National Assembly can {{consider}} the measure: The president must suggest the change, or 150,000 eligible voters must send a petition to the National Assembly. Both chambers of the National Assembly must discuss the proposed amendments for a minimum of three months. Two conditions can prevent a discussion from taking place: Either there is a state of emergency, or there are less than six months in the current term of the House of Representatives. In order for an amendment to take effect, it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> either two-thirds of both chambers of the National Assembly or a simple majority of the voting population of Belarus in a national referendum. The only restriction is that Sections One, Two, Four and Eight can only be changed by national referendum. Rules for conducting a national referendum are enumerated in Chapters 22 through 25 of the Electoral Code of the Republic of Belarus. Since the original adoption of the Constitution in 1994, it has been amended twice; once in 1996 and once in 2004.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the Kwan Um School of Zen, people became Dharma Teachers rather quickly, mostly out of need in order to run practice. The current requirement is that a person must take the five precepts after at least four days of retreat, or an agreed upon time by the guiding teacher of a Zen Center. To become a Dharma Teacher in Training will take the individual the minimum of two years after taking the five precepts. This also can only be approved of by the guiding teacher. The student will then take the ten precepts. To become a Dharma Teacher, one must complete a minimum of two years of training as a Dharma Teacher in Training that includes a course of study and certain amount of time attending retreats and serving certain practice roles. It takes a minimum of five years after becoming a Dharma Teacher to become a Senior Dharma Teacher and this <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the guiding teacher. At this time, the person will take the sixteen precepts. Receiving inga (inka) only comes when a student has proven satisfactorily in further training sanctioned by a Zen Master and members of the school. Becoming a Zen Master will require the sanction of several Zen Masters in and outside the school.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the current}} rules, players must have at least 10 years of major league {{experience}} {{to be eligible for}} induction. In addition, they must be retired {{for at least five years}} if living, or deceased for at least six months. Players meeting these qualifications must pass through a screening committee, and are then voted on by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Each writer may vote for up to 10 players; to be admitted into the Hall of Fame, a player <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> 75% of those casting ballots. Players receiving less than 5% approval are removed from future BBWAA ballots. The rules, as revised in July 2016, allow that all individuals eligible for induction but not for the BBWAA ballot—players who have not been approved by the BBWAA election process within 15 years of their retirement, umpires, managers, pioneers, and executives—may be considered by one of four voting bodies that have taken over the role of the former Veterans Committee, based on the era in which each individual candidate made his greatest contribution to the sport. On a few occasions, exceptions have been made to the guidelines in place at the time: Lou Gehrig was elected in 1939 following his diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Roberto Clemente was elected shortly after his death in 1972; and Addie Joss was elected in 1978 even though he completed only nine seasons before his death.|$|E
