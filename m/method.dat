40|$|Ordinary {{differential}} equations arise {{frequently in the}} study of the physical world. Un-fortunately many cannot be solved exactly. This is why the ability to solve these equations numerically is important. Traditionally mathematicians have used one of two classes of <b>methods</b> for numerically solving ordinary {{differential equations}}. These are linear multistep <b>methods</b> and Runge–Kutta <b>methods.</b> General linear <b>methods</b> were introduced as a unifying framework for these traditional <b>methods.</b> They have both the multi-stage nature of Runge–Kutta <b>methods</b> as well as the multi-value nature of linear multistep <b>methods.</b> This extremely broad class of <b>methods,</b> besides containing Runge–Kutta and linear multistep <b>methods</b> as special cases, also contains hybrid <b>methods,</b> cyclic composite linear multistep <b>methods</b> and pseudo Runge–Kutta <b>methods.</b> In this thesis we present a class of <b>methods</b> known as Almost Runge–Kutta <b>methods.</b> This is a special class of general linear <b>methods</b> which retains many of the properties of traditional Runge–Kutta <b>methods,</b> but with some advantages.

30|$|In this subsection, {{we present}} two {{heuristic}} algorithms for MK CP. As mentioned in ‘Related work’ {{section in the}} literature, there are mainly four categories of <b>methods</b> for community partition: hierarchy-based <b>methods,</b> spectrum-based <b>methods,</b> density-based <b>methods,</b> and modularity-based <b>methods.</b> In our point of view, spectrum-based <b>methods,</b> density-based <b>methods,</b> and modularity-based <b>methods</b> are not suitable for MK CP. In spectrum-based <b>methods,</b> communities are partitioned by studying the adjacency matrix which cannot reflect the information of influence propagation. In density-based <b>methods,</b> communities are defined as areas of higher density than {{the remainder of the}} data set. Therefore, this category of <b>methods</b> requires the location knowledge of nodes which cannot be formulated in our MK CP problem. In modularity-based <b>methods,</b> the objective of community partition is only to maximize the global modularity score. Therefore, all the three categories of <b>methods</b> cannot be applied for MK CP and we focus on hierarchy-based <b>methods.</b>|$|R
