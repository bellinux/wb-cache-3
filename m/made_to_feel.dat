5|$|The {{experience}} of the last ten days must satisfy everyone that if freight trains are stopped on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the city of Baltimore is not only deprived of the great commercial advantages which she has heretofore enjoyed, but the entire community is <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that all business must be seriously crippled {{and the price of}} all kinds of family supplies greatly increased.|$|E
5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) is {{reluctant}} {{to follow up on}} the case of murdered drug addict Jenny Goode, who was run over by a car. The case has been cold for three months, but he is <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> guilty by his partner Bolander (Ned Beatty) into reexamining it. Munch makes no progress after speaking with the family and reexamining notes. Based on witness accounts of a man with long blond hair and a black car, Munch spends all night looking through suspect photos until he finds a man with a black car with front end damage and long black hair, but blond eyebrows. Munch and Bolander question him, believing the suspect (Joe Hansard) to have dyed his hair to change his appearance after killing the woman. He quickly confesses to having hit her accidentally while driving drunk.|$|E
5|$|Survival horror is a subgenre {{of video}} games {{inspired}} by horror fiction {{that focuses on}} survival of the character as the game tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or scary ambience. Although combat {{can be part of}} the gameplay, the player is <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition, health, speed and vision, or through various obstructions of the player's interaction with the game mechanics. The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game. Games make use of strong horror themes, like dark maze-like environments and unexpected attacks from enemies.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{designed}} to have a future-retro look, with heavy use of grey tones to give a dreary, stagnant feel to totalitarian London. The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{like a cross between}} a crypt and an undercroft. The Gallery is V's home as well as the place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, Bacchus and Ariadne by Titian, a Mildred Pierce poster, St. Sebastian by Andrea Mantegna, The Lady of Shalott by John William Waterhouse and statues by Giacometti.|$|E
25|$|Slang terms {{derived from}} gago are kagaguhan ("a foolish action"), ogag (same meaning as gago), and nakagago ("to be <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> stupid"). Ulol, loko, and sira ulo {{can be used}} similarly, {{but they are not}} interchangeable; they also imply madness or mental {{retardation}} on top of stupidity.|$|E
25|$|If {{the patient}} can {{be led to}} accept one suggestion, they will more readily accept others. With {{resistant}} patients, it becomes necessary to find a suggestion that they can accept. Resistance is always important, and should always be respected, so if the resistance itself is encouraged, the patient is <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> more comfortable, {{because they know that}} they are allowed to respond however they wish.|$|E

5000|$|After {{entering}} the NFL's substance abuse program, Soward was critical about its effectiveness. [...] "It was horrible counseling. I’ve been in every rehab centre known to man," [...] said Soward. [...] "They {{even had the}} nerve to put me in rehab in Miami, the drug capital of the world. I don’t really think the rehabilitation process is very good for players down there. I think it is more of a disciplinary kind of rehabilitation which doesn’t teach anybody anything. For me, the more they took away from me the more it <b>made</b> me want <b>to</b> drink, the more it <b>made</b> me want <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> depressed, the more it <b>made</b> me want <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> bad about me." ...|$|R

25|$|By the 1970s the OPC {{had grown}} a new ‘pietist/revivalist’ wing under the {{influence}} of Jack Miller. According to Tim Keller, the New Life Churches and their Sonship course represented classic revivalism, and it did not fit well with the more doctrinalist cast of the OPC. The New Life Churches were <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> unwelcome and nearly all left in the early 90s to swell the pietist ranks of the PCA.|$|E
25|$|With {{the other}} {{planters}} Milan was equally whimsical. For trifling misdemeanors, he instituted elaborate investigations and meted out extravagant fines and punishments where a wiser {{man would have}} overlooked the whole matter. Offending negroes were <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{the pressure of the}} governor's heavy hand. A runaway who might have been mercifully beheaded was impaled alive on a sharpened stick to die in horrible agony. Another negro, arrested on a similar charge, had his foot cut off, after which he was confiscated to the governor's use and put to work in his kitchen.|$|E
25|$|The {{main effect}} of {{suspension}} bondage {{is to create a}} heightened sense of vulnerability and inescapability, as the subject is <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that by attempting to free themselves they may fall and hurt themselves, thus also creating a form of mental bondage in addition to the physical one that holds them. Being suspended, especially in a large open space, also creates a sense of objectification, submissiveness and erotic helplessness for the subject, which can be erotically stimulating for them and for those observing them. Rope suspension is sometimes done as performance art at BDSM conventions and fetish-themed nightclubs.|$|E

50|$|The present Gbongan could, {{therefore}} {{be said to}} be founded around C1825, {{at a time when there}} was a renewed influx of people from the crumbling Oyo empire. The fact that Gbongan was headed by an Oba attracted many people to settle there, and the fact that the town had moved to a truly forested region <b>made</b> people <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> secure. By the middle of the 19th century, Gbongan had become one of the biggest towns in this region.|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} psychological {{affect on}} Hilde was the coercion {{to embody the}} patriarchal fascist belief system {{of the time and}} to inculcate it into her own personal identity. She was <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> inferior and submissive, but also encouraged to never exclude herself from a group. This personal type of fascism aided in the rally of Austrian youth to support the Nazi cause during the Mühlviertler Hasenjagd. Many years after the period of National Socialism, it was still difficult for Hilde to extricate herself from this pattern of thinking. As an adult, she still felt extreme anxiety about being excluded from groups and events.|$|E
25|$|Among {{victims who}} are still living with their {{perpetrators}} high amounts of stress, fear, and anxiety are commonly reported. Depression is also common, as victims are <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> guilty for ‘provoking’ the abuse and are frequently subjected to intense criticism. It is reported that 60% of victims meet the diagnostic criteria for depression, either during or after termination of the relationship, and have a greatly increased risk of suicide. Those who are battered either emotionally or physically often are also depressed because of a feeling of worthlessness. These feelings often persist long-term and {{it is suggested that}} many receive therapy for it because of the heightened risk of suicide and other traumatic symptoms.|$|E
25|$|John Conolly took up {{residence}} as the third superintendent on 1 June 1839. In April 1839, Serjeant-at-law John Adams, one of the Visiting Justices of the asylum and a founding member and first chairman of Legal & General, suggested that Conolly visit the Lincoln Asylum and see the system operated by Robert Gardiner Hill. He was so impressed by this {{that he decided to}} abolish mechanical restraints at Hanwell. This must have taken enormous powers of persuasion: the existing staff would have to change their work practices and learn how to nurse more effectively those patients with troubling behaviour. However, the reform seemed to avoid the patient suffering further trauma as a result of restraint and being <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> completely helpless. Conolly succeeded in introducing the reform by 21 September 1839, less than 3 months after he took charge. This is perhaps a testament to the earlier work of Ellis.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, the 'Skin Jean' was launched: a line {{of leather}} {{trousers}} <b>made</b> <b>to</b> look and <b>feel</b> like jeans. In the same year the Minoray technique was created by contouring strips of leather on a base of silk organza around {{the contours of the}} body.|$|R

50|$|Marvin Gaye {{was going}} through a {{personal}} crisis in the summer of 1976. In November 1975, Gaye's estranged first wife, Anna Gordy Gaye, sued Gaye for divorce, claiming irreconcilable differences, and sought child support for their adopted son, Marvin Gaye III. Gaye later argued his spending habit was causing him to fall behind on payments. In September 1976, a warrant was issued for Gaye's arrest after he failed to pay alimony; this <b>made</b> him <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> vulnerable during the recording sessions causing the singer to hide from the public for several days.|$|R
25|$|The series {{begins with}} the mirror {{appearing}} in the attic of {{a house in the}} country and Daniel traveling to meet his father, and new step-siblings for the first time. When he arrives at the house, he is not <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> very welcome. His stepsister Mandy is very upset and runs off to the attic. Daniel tries to resolve the upset and goes after her. When he enters the attic he notices the reflection of a young girl in the mirror. Daniel tries to investigate but Mandy gets in his way and they stumble through the mirror into 1867. They eventually get back, but later Lily and Mandy go through the mirror. While they are in 1867, the mirror is knocked out of alignment and they cannot travel back to their own time. Trapped in 1867 they spend the night in the de Lutrelle's barn. They finally get back home when the mirror is put back into alignment.|$|E
25|$|Episode five: Bianca and Andy - Bianca {{was very}} much {{looking forward to the}} time when her husband Andy {{returned}} from an eighteen-year stint serving with the RAF. The thirty-four-year-old couple were reunited to help bring up their growing family. But events did not run as expected. With three boys under ten, and a fourth child on the way, Bianca feels over-worked and unappreciated by her partner. Meanwhile, Andy does not adjust easily to spending so much time at home and now feels there is no communication in the partnership. Andy makes an effort to dress up for college, but at home Bianca only sees him in old jeans with socks and sandals. Woodall and Constantine question whether a new wardrobe can help the couple's marriage. Woodall helps Bianca to embrace her growing pregnancy bump with carefully fitted dresses and tops. With the help of hairdresser Richard Ward the couple are transformed and given a fresh look and <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> happier and more comfortable together in their relationship.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, a {{new threat}} to the Cape arose. Some 900 of the Kat river Khoikhoi, who had in former wars been firm allies of the British, joined their former enemies: the Xhosa. They were not without justification. They complained that while serving as {{soldiers}} in former wars — the Cape Mounted Rifles consisted largely of Khoikhois — they had not received the same treatment as others serving in defence of the colony, that they got no compensation for the losses they had sustained, {{and that they were}} in various ways <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> they were a wronged and injured race. A secret alliance was formed with the Xhosa to take up arms in order to remove the Europeans and establish a Khoikhoi republic. Within a fortnight of the attack on Colonel Mackinnon, the Kat river Khoikhoi were also in arms. Their revolt was followed by that of the Khoikhoi at other missionary stations, and some of the Khoikhoi of the Cape Mounted Rifles followed their example, including some of the very men who had escorted the governor from Fort Cox. But many of the Khoikhoi remained loyal, and the Fingo likewise sided with the Cape government.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked across}} {{at him as}} he sat, plump and rosy and complacent, puffing at his cigarette, and my heart warmed to the old ruffian. It was {{impossible}} to maintain an attitude of righteous iciness with him. I might loathe his mode of life, and hate him as a representative--and a leading representative--of one of the most contemptible trades on earth, but there was a sunny charm about the man himself which <b>made</b> it hard <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> hostile <b>to</b> him as an individual.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Peedles, {{speaking}} without rising, {{from personal}} observation in the daytime--which she hoped {{would not be}} deemed a liberty; literature, even in manuscript, being, so to speak, public property--found herself {{in a position to}} confirm all that Mr. Jarman had remarked. Speaking as one not entirely without authority on the subject of literature and the drama, Mrs. Peedles could say that passages she had read had struck her as distinctly not half bad. Some of the love-scenes, in particular, had <b>made</b> her <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> quite a girl again. How he had acquired such knowledge was not for her to say. Cries of [...] "Naughty!" [...] from Jarman, and [...] "Oh, Mr. Kelver, I shall be quite afraid of you," [...] roguishly from Miss Sellars.|$|R
500|$|Amid {{frequent}} court appearances battling {{to stay in}} the United States, Lennon became stressed, {{a situation}} that was only worsened by constant surveillance by the FBI, due to his political activism. Lennon said, [...] "I just couldn't function, you know? I was so paranoid from them tappin' the phone and followin' me." [...] All this combined <b>made</b> Lennon begin <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> emotionally withdrawn. Lennon put his suffering aside to write the songs for Mind Games, writing all the songs for it in a week.|$|R
25|$|Contacts between Russia and Australia {{date back}} to 1803, when Secretary of State for the Colonies Lord Hobart wrote to Governor of New South Wales Philip Gidley King in {{relation}} to the first Russian circumnavigation of the globe by Adam Johann von Krusenstern and Yuri Lisyansky. As the Russian and British empires were allies in the war against Napoleon, the Russian warship Neva, with Captain Ludwig von Hagemeister at the helm, was able to sail into Port Jackson on 16 June 1807. Hagemeister and the ship's officers were extended the utmost courtesy by Governor William Bligh, with the Governor inviting the Russians to Government House for dinner and a ball. This was the beginning of personal contacts between Russians and Australians, and Russian ships would continue to visit Australian shores, particularly as a stop on their way to supplying the Empire's North American colonies. The Suvorov commanded by Captain Mikhail Lazarev spent twenty-two days in New South Wales in 1814, when it brought news of Napoleon's defeat, and this was followed up by the 1820 visit of the Otkrytiye and Blagonamerenny. In 1820, Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Vasilyev arrived in New South Wales, on board Antarctic research ships Vostok and Mirny, under the command of Mikhail Lazarev. Bellingshausen returned to Sydney after discovering Antarctica, spending the winter at the invitation of Governor Lachlan Macquarie. Macquarie played the greatest role in the expression of Russophilia in the Colony, ensuring that the Russian visitors were <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> welcome. While in Sydney, Bellingshausen collected information on the colony, which he published in Russia as Short Notes on the Colony of New South Wales. He wrote that Schmidt, a naturalist who was attached to the Lazarev expedition, discovered gold near Hartley, making him the first person to discover gold in Australia. While in Sydney, on 27 March 1820, officials from the colony were invited on board the Vostok to celebrate Orthodox Easter, marking {{the first time that a}} Russian Orthodox service was held in the Australian Colonies.|$|E

500|$|Turner had a {{very close}} {{relationship}} with her only daughter, Cheryl (b. 1943).

5000|$|The newly {{released}} [...] "I Don’t Wanna Be In Love", featured in {{an episode of}} Vampire Diaries, hit #2 on the Hype Machine’s most popular chart. [...] "I wrote this song {{toward the end of}} a relationship," [...] says Long. [...] "I didn't realize how weighed down I felt until after it ended, but I knew something wasn't right. It <b>made</b> me sad <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> disconnected from someone that I once felt so close to. The song is basically me taking a look at my situation and being honest with myself about how I felt." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{with all}} these excellences, there is one fault, which I [...] {{considered}} a great one, and which does not comport with the general [...] character of the school for kindness and good feeling. It is the [...] little effort made by the scholars to become acquainted with the [...] new ones who enter. Whoever goes there, must push herself forward, [...] or she will never feel at home. The young ladies seem to forget, [...] that the new comer must feel rather unpleasantly, {{in the midst of}} a [...] hundred persons, to whom she is wholly a stranger, and with no one [...] to speak to. Two or three will stand together, and instead of [...] deciding upon some plan, by which the individual may be <b>made</b> <b>to</b> [...] <b>feel</b> at ease, something like the following conversation takes [...] place.|$|R
500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with the Grand Rapids Press, Dufek recalled growing up in Ann Arbor and meeting his father's Michigan teammates.

Then, as you got older, and you got more deeply involved in the game yourself, you just hoped that {{you had a chance to}} play in college -- and after watching all those games at Michigan Stadium, that maybe Michigan would take a chance on you." ...|$|R
