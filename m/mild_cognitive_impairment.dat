5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the {{cerebral}} cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy {{of the affected}} regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, {{and parts of the}} frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus. Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from <b>mild</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{study the}} {{features}} of piribedil use {{in the treatment of}} <b>mild</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Material and methods. Open randomized study of piribedil efficacy in treatment of <b>mild</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> of the patients with CHF and ischemic heart disease was performed. Eligible patients were randomized into group of piribedil treatment or control group. Each group included 20 patients. Patients of the main group received piribedil 50 mg a day during 12 weeks. Cognitive functions were estimated by Burdon’s test, 5 and 7 subtests of Wexler before and after 12 weeks of treatment. Results. Significant improvement of cognitive tests was revealed in patients receiving piribedil at the final visit. Maximum effect of the drug was observed in younger patients, patients with increased carotid arteries intima-media thickness and increased left ventricular end-diastolic dimension. Conclusion. Piribedil significantly improves memory and attention in patients with CHF and can be used in therapy of <b>mild</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> in these patients. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate changes in cognitive functions, depression and life-satisfaction for elderly participants with <b>mild</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> participating in an individual cognitive improvement program. Methods: A quasi-experimental with non-equivalent control group pretest-posttest design was implemented. The participants were senior citizens over 65 years of age who had been clinically diagnosed with <b>mild</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> in G City and J Province (experimental group: 29, control group: 27). The experimental group participated in the individual cognitive improvement program based on Korean traditional tales and games for nine weeks. Results: After the intervention, only the participants in the experimental group reported significant improvement in K-MMSE (t=- 2. 5, p=. 016), MoCA-K (t=- 2. 6, p=. 008), depression (t= 3. 51, p=. 001), and life sat-isfaction (t=- 2. 75, p=. 008) when compared to those in the control group.

5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} usually {{diagnosed}} {{based on the}} person's medical history, history from relatives, and behavioural observations. The presence of characteristic neurological and neuropsychological features {{and the absence of}} alternative conditions is supportive. Advanced medical imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to help exclude other cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia.

5|$|Reduction in the {{activity}} of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only donepezil is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. The use of these drugs in <b>mild</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are mild to moderate in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses. Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (bradycardia), decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production.|$|E

25|$|Age is a {{major risk}} factor for most common {{neurodegenerative}} diseases, including <b>mild</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment,</b> Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease. While much {{research has focused on}} diseases of aging, there are few informative studies on the molecular biology of the aging brain (usually spelled ageing brain in British English) in the absence of neurodegenerative disease or the neuropsychological profile of healthy older adults. However, research does suggest that the aging process is associated with several structural, chemical, and functional changes in the brain as well as a host of neurocognitive changes.

[...] In 'normal aging', the brain is undergoing oxidative stress in a multitude of ways. [...] The main contributors include protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation and oxidative modifications in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. [...] Oxidative stress can damage DNA replication and inhibit repair through many complex processes, including telomere shortening in DNA components. [...] Each time a somatic cell replicates, the telomeric DNA component shortens. [...] As telomere length is partly inheritable, there are individual differences in the age of onset of cognitive decline.|$|E

The {{spectrum}} ranges from <b>mild</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment</b> to the neurodegenerative diseases of Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease. Furthermore, many types of [...] memory may decline with ageing, but not semantic memory or general knowledge such as vocabulary definitions, which typically increases or remains steady until late adulthood [...] (see Ageing brain). Intelligence may decline with age, though the rate may vary depending on the type and may in fact remain steady throughout most of the lifespan, dropping suddenly only as people near the end of their lives. Individual variations in rate of cognitive decline may therefore be explained in terms of people having different lengths of life. There might be changes to the brain: after 20 years of age there may be a 10% reduction each decade in the total length of the brain's myelinated axons.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{contemporary}} cognitive theorists postulate models {{featuring a}} central pool [...] "of mental resources {{that must be}} allocated to the various operations involved in processing, retaining, and reporting information". This means that working memory and the various {{areas of the brain}} responsible for it are theoretically limited to a finite set of [...] "mental resources" [...] or mental capacity with which to carry out operation. Cognitive inhibition, of course, is responsible for determining what is relevant to the working memory and shuts out what is irrelevant, [...] "freeing up space" [...] and mental capacity needed for more pressing matters. In the theory of inefficient inhibition, cognitive inhibition does not perform its function fully, and a shortage of mental resources leads to decreased performance or inefficiency in tasks that require more mental capacity. While inefficient inhibition can result naturally in individuals diagnosed with <b>mild</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairment,</b> this effect is especially pronounced in methamphetamine-dependent individuals. Clinically, these individuals can be highly distractible and exhibit difficulty focusing, which illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition is being impaired and that inefficient inhibition is resulting. Because {{of the nature of the}} psychoactive drug, the brain is unable or reduced in its capacity to shut out irrelevant stimuli to the task at hand, and so tries to process and respond to any and all stimuli. This is most likely due to the effects of methamphetamine on inhibitory neurotransmitters like GABA, discussed in an earlier section.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWith ageing of the {{population}} in the world, patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) consequently increase. People suffering from this pathology show early modifications in their "activities of daily living". Those abilities modifications are part of the dementia diagnosis, but are often not reported by the patients or their families. Being able to capture these early signs of autonomy loss could be a way to diagnose earlier dementia and to prevent insecurity at home. We first developed a wearable camera (shoulder mounted) to capture people's activity at home in a non-invasive manner. We then developed a video-indexing methodology to help physicians explore their patients' home-recorded video. This video indexing system requires video and audio analyses to automatically identify and index activities of interest where insecurity or risks could be highlightened. Patients are recruited among the Bagatelle (Talence, France) Memory clinic department patients and are suffering from <b>mild</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> or very <b>mild</b> AD. We met ten patients at home and we recorded one hour of daily activities for each. The data (video and questionnaires: Activities of Daily Living/Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) are now collected on an extended sample of people suffering from <b>mild</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>impairments</b> and from very mild AD. We aimed at evaluating behavioral modifications and ability loss detection by comparing the subjects' self reported questionnaires and the video analyses. This project is a successful collaboration between various fields of research. Here, technology is developed to be helpful in everyday challenges that people suffering from dementia of the Alzheimer type are faced with. The automation of the video indexing could be a great step forward in video analysis if it could reduce the time needed to embrace the patient's lifestream, helping in early diagnosis of dementia and becoming a very useful tool to keep individuals safe at home. In fact, many goals could be reached with such video analyses: an early diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer type, avoiding danger in home living and evaluating the progression of the disease or the effects of the various therapies (drug-therapy and others) ...|$|R
