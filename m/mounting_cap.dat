To investigate the possibility of designing and producing a noninvasive artificial visionary system an interdisciplinary {{research has been}} carried out. The concept solution is based on the conversion of moving images captured through a camera and converting them into visual signals for optical nerve. The proposed system is EEG based non-invasive brain computer interface (BCI).

50|$|Articulated {{specimens}} {{are known}} from Cambrian Stage 3 of Xiaoshiba, China; fragmentary specimens {{have also been}} found in the Chengjiang, Cambrian Series 2 deposits in Guizhou, China, and in China's lowermost Cambrian Series 3 beds of the Kaili Formation, in the Middle Cambrian beds of the Tyrovice Member, Buchava Formation of the Czech Republic, in the Lower Cambrian <b>Mount</b> <b>Cap</b> formation (Mackenzie Mountains, Canada), in the Emu Bay Shale of Kangaroo Island, South Australia, upper Botomian Stage of the Lower Cambrian, and in the Middle Botomian Sinsk Biota of the Siberia, Russia. Isolated sclerites are also common in the small carbonaceous fossil record. Taken together, these finds show that Wiwaxia had a truly cosmopolitan distribution, occurring at all palaeolatitudes and on most palaeocontinents. The Chinese material was originally considered to represent a separate species; like W. corrugata, it possessed spines and regions of sclerites (although it is only known from disarticulated remains), but the sclerites bear a higher density of ribs, and there are two distinct thicknesses of rib (i.e. larger and smaller). At a microscopic level, the sclerites do not differ from Burgess Shale or <b>Mount</b> <b>Cap</b> sclerites, but the Chinese material seems to have developed spines from an early age, distinguishing it from the W. corrugata. The knob-bearing sclerites from all three localities seem to belong to a different species, and a further species is represented in the Xiaoshiba deposits. What is surprising is the limited variety exhibited between species: all have a fundamentally equivalent scleritome, displaying a notable degree of morphological stasis for some 15 Ma.|$|R
5000|$|A more {{informative}} data source is the organic microfossils of the <b>Mount</b> <b>Cap</b> formation, Mackenzie Mountains, Canada. This late Early Cambrian assemblage (...) consists of microscopic fragments of arthropods' cuticle, which is left behind when the rock is dissolved with hydrofluoric acid. The diversity of this assemblage {{is similar to}} that of modern crustacean faunas. Most interestingly, analysis of fragments of feeding machinery found in the formation shows that it was adapted to feed in a very precise and refined fashion. This contrasts with most other early Cambrian arthropods, which fed messily by shovelling anything they could get their feeding appendages on into their mouths. This sophisticated and specialised feeding machinery belonged to a large (about 30 cm) organism, and would have provided great potential for diversification; specialised feeding apparatus allows a number of different approaches to feeding and development, and creates a number of different approaches to avoid being eaten.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although silver {{nanoparticles}} are {{of great}} fundamental and practical interest, only one structure {{has been determined}} thus far: M 4 Ag 44 (SPh) 30, where M is a monocation, and SPh is an aromatic thiolate ligand. This is {{in part due to}} the fact that no other molecular silver nanoparticles have been synthesized with aromatic thiolate ligands. Here we report the synthesis of M 3 Ag 17 (4 -tert-butylbenzene-thiol) 12, which has good stability and an unusual optical spectrum. We also present a rational strategy for predicting the structure of this molecule. First-principles calculations support the structural model, predict a HOMO−LUMO energy gap of 1. 77 eV, and predict a new “monomer <b>mount</b> ” <b>capping</b> motif, Ag(SR) 3, for Ag nanoparticles.

So he was in an urgent need for a suitable mill stump to <b>mount</b> the <b>cap</b> on, as he had no place to put his new acquisition. He bought the wrecked Heckington mill, and, from 1891 until early 1892, he fitted the white onion-shaped and fantail-driven Tuxford's Mill cap to the Heckington Mill and set it working for the following 54 years. Later on he installed a large circular saw-mill in a shed on one side, also driven by wind-power using line-shafts. It was used to make elm boards for coffins. John Pocklington was very successful in milling, baking, building, sawing, and farming. In that time and even up today the mill was also called the Pocklington's Mill.|$|R

Using a colour image sequence recorded by a camera <b>mounted</b> to a <b>caps</b> head, we train a population of neurons to achieve optimally stable responses.

The proposed objective thus successfully separates cells which are specific for orientation and invariant to colour from orientation invariant colour cells...|$|R

Microneedle patches are designed to serve this need by collecting dermal interstitial fluid containing biomarkers without the dangers, pain, or expertise needed to collect blood. This study presents novel methods to collect biomarker analytes from microneedle patches for analysis by integration into conventional analytical laboratory microtubes and microplates. Microneedle patches were made out of cross-linked hydrogel composed of poly(methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic acid) and poly(ethylene glycol) prepared by micromolding. Micro-needle patches were shown to swell with water up to 50 -fold in volume, depending on degree of polymer cross-linking, and to collect interstitial fluid from the skin of rats.

30|$|I {{would never}} have {{expected}} to almost lose all my crystals brought to Brookhaven that day. I thought I was well prepared for the data collection because I had already carried out all the experimental procedures at home in Boston. The well-developed crystals were safely harvested from the tiny droplet into a large well with so-called cryo-protectant solution. These incubated crystals could then be fished up using a small nylon loop supported on a metal cap, and quickly flash frozen by <b>mounting</b> the <b>cap</b> on the diffractometer equipped with cold stream from liquid nitrogen, ready to shoot with X-rays. The problem arose when the <b>cap</b> was <b>mounted</b> on the machine by the magnetic force. On Bob’s machine, the magnet {{was so strong that}} the moment a crystal was put on, the force that attracted the cap on the machine shook the crystal off from the nylon loop, no matter how careful I was. We only had three crystals had left. The atmosphere, not the crystals, seemed frozen. Ellis suggested that everyone leave the room. He then turned to me and said: “Jia-huai, I am going to buy lunch for you. Just relaxed”. That did help reduce the tension! I used my right hand to fish crystal, at the same time I used my left hand to help hold the cap more smoothly and set the crystal on. A beautiful diffraction pattern showed up. This was our first 2.8 Å data set of TCR crystal! That would lead to our 1998 published study (Wang et al., 1998).|$|R
