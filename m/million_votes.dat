5|$|In 1972 and 1973 Thorpe's {{political}} fortunes, {{and those}} of the Liberals, revived. Thorpe's personal standing was enhanced when, on 14 March 1973, he married Marion, Countess of Harewood, whose former husband was a first cousin to the Queen. After a series of by-election victories and local government gains, an electoral breakthrough for the party looked plausible when Heath called a general election in February 1974. In that election, with more than six <b>million</b> <b>votes</b> (19.3% of those cast), the Liberals achieved by far their best election result since the Second World War, but under the first-past-the-post voting system this large vote translated into only 14 seats. However, as neither major party won an overall majority, these seats gave Thorpe (whose personal majority in North Devon increased to 11,072) significant leverage. He was briefly in coalition discussions with Heath, who was prepared to give cabinet posts to Thorpe and other senior Liberals. Thorpe later denied that there was any serious prospect of agreement, and in March 1974 Harold Wilson formed a minority Labour government. In the second 1974 general election, in October, Wilson achieved a narrow majority; the Liberals lost ground, with 5.3 <b>million</b> <b>votes</b> and 13 MPs.|$|E

McKinley won with 7.1 <b>million</b> <b>votes</b> to Bryan's 6.5 million, 51% to 47%. The electoral vote was not as close: 271 for McKinley to 176 for Bryan. McKinley increased the Republican vote by 2,000,000 from Harrison's defeat in 1892, though Bryan also increased the Democratic total.|$|E

5|$|Willkie {{concluded}} {{his campaign}} on November 2 {{with a large}} rally at New York's Madison Square Garden.

Willkie received 45 {{percent of the popular}} vote to Roosevelt's 55 percent. The president received 27.2 <b>million</b> <b>votes</b> to Willkie's 22.3 million, and won 449 to 82 in the Electoral College.

5|$|One hundred {{players were}} chosen {{to be on the}} ballot for the All-Star Game (minimum of two players from each team), but fans were also given the option to write in any player who was not listed. Ballots were all digital for the fourth {{consecutive}} time, giving fans the ability to cast votes online at NHL.com and Facebook.

The NHL put no limitation on the number of votes an individual could cast. When fan balloting ended, 14.3 <b>million</b> <b>votes</b> had been cast and the top six were named to the All-Star Game.

Individually, Sidney Crosby led all players with 635,509 votes, while teammate Kris Letang was elected as a write-in candidate. The six players elected by the fans are listed below with their vote totals.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{faced the}} Atlanta Braves in the 1996 National League Championship Series. Smith started Game 1 and {{subsequently}} registered three putouts and one {{assist in the}} field, but went hitless in four at-bats in the Cardinals' 4–2 loss. The Cardinals then won Games 2, 3, and 4, contests in which Smith did not appear. Upon receiving the start in Game 5, Smith nearly duplicated his Game 1 performance with four putouts, one assist, and zero hits in four at-bats as part of another Cardinals defeat. The Cardinals also failed to win Game 6 or Game 7 in Atlanta, ending their season. When the Cardinals were trailing by ten runs during Game 7 on October 17, Smith flied out to right field while pinch-hitting in the sixth inning, marking {{the end of his}} playing career. Smith finished his career with distinctions ranging from the accumulation of more than 27.5 <b>million</b> <b>votes</b> in All-Star balloting, to holding the record for the most MLB at-bats without hitting a grand slam.|$|E

5|$|The rapid {{deterioration}} of the economy led to the resignation on 27 March 1930 of the coalition government that had been elected in 1928. A new cabinet was formed, and Paul von Hindenburg used his power as president to govern via emergency decrees. He appointed Heinrich Brüning as chancellor. Goebbels {{took charge of the}} NSDAP's national campaign for Reichstag elections called for 14 September 1930. Campaigning was undertaken on a huge scale, with thousands of meetings and speeches held all over the country. Hitler's speeches focused on blaming the country's economic woes on the Weimar Republic, particularly its adherence to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which required war reparations that had proven devastating to the German economy. He proposed a new German society based on race and national unity. The resulting success took even Hitler and Goebbels by surprise: the party received 6.5 <b>million</b> <b>votes</b> nationwide and took 107 seats in the Reichstag, making it the second largest party in the country.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe {{was the son}} and {{grandson}} of Conservative MPs, but decided to align with the small and ailing Liberal Party. After studying at Oxford University {{he became one of}} the Liberals' brightest stars in the 1950s. He entered parliament at the age of 30, made a rapid mark, and was elected party leader in 1967. After an uncertain start during which the party lost ground, Thorpe capitalised on the growing unpopularity of the Conservative and Labour parties to lead the Liberals through a period of notable electoral success. This culminated in the general election of February 1974, when the party won 6 <b>million</b> <b>votes.</b> Under the first-past-the-post electoral system this gave them only 14 seats, but with the election having resulted in a hung parliament with no party having an overall majority, Thorpe was in a strong position. He was offered a cabinet post by the Conservative prime minister, Edward Heath, if he would bring the Liberals into a coalition. His price for such a deal, reform of the electoral system, was rejected by Heath, who resigned in favour of a minority Labour government.|$|E
