Honda was the eighth largest automobile manufacturer in the world behind Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Hyundai Motor Group, General Motors, Ford, Nissan, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree of}} roast {{has an effect}} upon coffee flavor and body. Darker roasts are {{generally}} bolder because they have less fiber content and a more sugary flavor. Lighter roasts have a more complex and therefore perceived stronger flavor from aromatic oils and acids otherwise destroyed by longer roasting times. Roasting does not alter the amount of caffeine in the bean, but does give less caffeine when the beans are <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>volume</b> because the beans expand during roasting.|$|E
2500|$|Saucepans (or just [...] "pots") are vessels with {{vertical}} sides {{about the}} same height as their diameter, used for simmering or boiling. Saucepans generally have one long handle. Larger pots of the same shape generally have two handles close {{to the sides of}} the pot (so they can be lifted with both hands), and are called sauce-pots [...] or soup pots (3–12 litres). Saucepans and saucepots are <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>volume</b> (usually 1–8 l). While saucepots often resemble Dutch ovens in shape, {{they do not have the}} same heat capacity characteristics. Very small saucepans used for heating milk are referred to as , such saucepans usually have a lip for pouring the heated milk.|$|E
50|$|Theoretical {{framework}} of the model can be either cost theory or production theory. In a model based on the production theory, the volume of activity is <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> input <b>volume.</b> In a model based on the cost theory, the volume of activity is <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> output <b>volume.</b>|$|R

50|$|Despite {{historical}} {{consumer preference}} for refined flour and the traditionally higher per-unit cost of whole grain, whole-wheat flour products are ascendant {{largely due to}} changing consumer attitudes. The Whole Grains Council industry association reports an approximate doubling of the whole-wheat flour production {{over the course of}} the years 2003 to 2007. In another visible example, whole-wheat bread has reached approximate parity with soft white bread as <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> slice <b>volume</b> in the United States; as of 2010, whole-wheat bread narrowly exceeds soft white bread as <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> dollar <b>volume.</b>|$|R
2500|$|When Shasta was completed, it was {{the second}} highest dam in the world – surpassed only by Hoover Dam on the Colorado – as well as the highest {{man-made}} structure in California. It was also the second most massive concrete dam <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>volume,</b> exceeded only by Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in Washington. An anonymous workman reportedly said, [...] "Old Shasta's about the secondest dam there is." [...] When the dam was completed, chief engineer Frank Crowe is known to have declared, [...] "Look at that Shasta Dam. That dam will stand there forever holding back the river. And that powerhouse will keep right on turning out juice until somebody discovers how to make power out of sunlight." [...] (Ironically, the invention of photovoltaics in the 1950s disproved Crowe's claim, as the Shasta Dam continues to produce as much electricity as ever.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{quantity}} of gunpowder is specified by weight, but almost always <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>volume,</b> especially in larger scale operations. A powder scale {{is needed to}} determine the correct mass thrown by the powder measure, as loads are specified with a precision of 0.10 grain (6.5mg). One grain is 1/7000 of a pound. Competition shooters will generally throw a slightly underweight charge, and use a powder trickler to add few s of powder at a time to the charge to bring it to the exact weight desired for maximum consistency. Special care is needed when charging large capacity cases with fast burning, low volume powders. In this instance, it is possible to put two charges of powder in a case without overflowing the case, which can lead to dangerously high pressures and a significant chance of bursting the chamber of the firearm. Non-magnum revolver cartridges are the easiest to do this with, as they generally have relatively large cases, and tend to perform well with small charges of fast powders. [...] Some powders meter (measure by volume) better than others due to the shape of each granule. [...] When using volume to meter each charge, it is important to regularly check the charge weight on a scale throughout the process.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 April Charles {{wrote to}} his older sister Susan that he had also seen the {{rhinoceros}} in the zoo let {{out for the first}} time that spring, [...] "kicking & rearing" [...] and galloping for joy. He then passed on the gossip that Miss Martineau had been [...] "as frisky lately [...] the Rhinoceros. – Erasmus has been with her noon, morning, and night: – if her character was not as secure, as a mountain in the polar regions she certainly would loose it. – Lyell called there the other day & there was a beautiful rose on the table, & she coolly showed it to him & said [...] "Erasmus Darwin" [...] gave me that. – How fortunate it is, she is so very plain; otherwise I should be frightened: She is a wonderful woman". He began thinking about marriage himself, and on the back of an old letter (dated 7 April 1838) he listed the pros and cons of London, Cambridge or the countryside, noting that [...] "I have so much more pleasure in direct observation, that I could not go on as Lyell does, correcting & adding up new information to old train & I do not see what line can be followed by man tied down to London. – In country, experiment & observations on lower animals. – more space – [...] ". In an 8 May letter to his Cambridge friend Charles Thomas Whitley, who had recently married, Darwin described himself as having [...] "turned a complete scribbler", and said [...] "Of the future I know nothing I never look further ahead than two or three Chapters – for my life is now <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>volume,</b> chapters & sheets & has little to do with the sun – As for a wife, that most interesting specimen in the whole series of vertebrate animals, Providence only know whether I shall ever capture one or be able to feed her if caught." ...|$|E
50|$|The chaldron {{was used}} as the measure for coal from the 13th century, <b>measuring</b> <b>by</b> <b>volume</b> being much more {{practical}} than weighing low-value, high-bulk commodities like coal. It was not standardized, and there were many different regional chaldrons, the two most important being the Newcastle and London chaldrons. The Newcastle chaldron was used to measure all coal shipped from Northumberland and Durham, and the London chaldron became the standard measure for coal in the east and south of England.|$|R

The Concrete Mobile was the original and only mobile or volumetric concrete mixer at that time. The Concrete Mobile’s concept was simple. It was designed to hold the materials necessary to produce concrete separately and to <b>measure</b> <b>by</b> <b>volume</b> and mix the materials as needed on site. The Concrete Mobile provided customers good fresh, high quality concrete on demand when and where it was needed.|$|R

30|$|This {{study is}} the result of field work {{conducted}} in 2014 which resulted in an exhaustive inventory of the road network of Phewa Watershed (42  % of the total watershed road network) and road-related landslides. It is based on observations and measurements, which were at times roughly estimated (e.g. such as the age of an erosion event), yet supported by a statistical analysis. The study evaluated the direct and forecasted impacts of road construction as <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>volumes</b> of soil released by road construction and related direct economic impacts. Results demonstrate that road-induced erosion in the watershed is mostly occurring on roadside embankments, which produce small and shallow soil failures which often make the road drivable for no more than one year until the next monsoon season, which was the main trigger of all failures observed.|$|R
