5|$|If {{consciousness}} (the mind) {{can exist}} independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One {{possible explanation is}} that of a miracle, proposed by Arnold Geulincx and Nicolas Malebranche, where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.|$|E
5|$|It is one {{of several}} {{phenomena}} underlying synaptic plasticity, the ability of chemical synapses to change their strength. As <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> thought to be encoded by modification of synaptic strength, LTP is widely considered one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlies learning and memory.|$|E
5|$|Since {{different}} neuronal cell {{types are}} neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently {{been used as}} a model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was first discovered to occur in the hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed {{to be one of the}} main neural mechanisms by which <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> stored in the brain.|$|E
50|$|Declarative <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> the <b>memory</b> for {{conscious}} events. There are {{two types}} of declarative memory: episodic and semantic. Episodic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> for remembering experiences whereas semantic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> remembering specific facts.|$|R
50|$|In {{discussing}} multidirectional <b>memory,</b> it <b>is</b> {{important to}} highlight that screen <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> also {{a kind of}} multidirectional memory, even though screen memory operates more on the personal level while multidirectional <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> primarily collective. Screen <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> “covering up a traumatic event-another traumatic event-that cannot be approached directly”.|$|R
25|$|An autobiographical <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> a {{personal}} representation of general or specific events and personal facts. Autobiographical memory also refers to {{memory of a}} person's history. An individual does not remember exactly everything {{that has happened in}} one's past. <b>Memory</b> <b>is</b> constructive, where previous experience affects how we remember events and what we end up recalling from <b>memory.</b> Autobiographical <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> constructive and reconstructed as an evolving process of history. A person's autobiographical <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> fairly reliable; although, the reliability of autobiographical <b>memories</b> <b>is</b> questionable because of memory distortions.|$|R

5|$|Nova is the {{daughter}} of one of the highly influential Confederate Old Families; despite having unusually high psionic potential her father prevents her from being taken into the Confederate Ghost Program. However, after her family is murdered by an anti-Confederate resistance movement, Nova flees to the undercity of Tarsonis, where she is forced to work as an organized crime enforcer. Nova is rescued during the Zerg invasion of Tarsonis, and ends up in the possession of the newly formed Terran Dominion, who train her as a ghost.

50|$|<b>Memory</b> <b>is</b> a {{very broad}} {{function}} which includes several distinct abilities, {{all of which can}} be selectively impaired and require individual testing. There is disagreement as to the number of memory systems, depending on the psychological perspective taken. From a clinical perspective, a view of five distinct types of <b>memory,</b> <b>is</b> in most cases sufficient. Semantic memory and episodic memory (collectively called declarative memory or explicit memory); procedural memory and priming or perceptual learning (collectively called non-declarative memory or implicit memory) all four of which <b>are</b> long term <b>memory</b> systems; and working memory or short term <b>memory.</b> Semantic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> <b>memory</b> for facts, episodic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> autobiographical <b>memory,</b> procedural <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> <b>memory</b> for the performance of skills, priming <b>is</b> <b>memory</b> facilitated by prior exposure to a stimulus and working <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> a form of short term memory for information manipulation.|$|R
50|$|Declarative <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> <b>memory</b> {{which can}} <b>be</b> {{consciously}} recalled, such as facts and knowledge, for instance autobiographical memory. Within declarative <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> semantic and episodic <b>memory.</b> Semantic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> facts, and episodic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> recalling previous experiences in life. Studies on individuals with ASD has shown impairments to their episodic memory but a relative preservation of their semantic memory. The brain regions that {{play a major}} role in declarative learning and <b>memory</b> <b>are</b> the hippocampus and regions of the medial temporal lobe.Little research has been conducted on M-LFA individuals and memory function. Memory profiles of M-LFA individuals and of HFA individuals seem to be similar, but there is some evidence that declarative <b>memory</b> impairment <b>is</b> consistently greater for M-LFA individuals than for HFA individuals.|$|R

He gains access to Raghuveer's palace and overhears Ghora telling Raghuveer that if Indu's memories of the past are not revived within the day they can never be revived, and she will be with Raghuveer forever. Harsha kidnaps Indu and takes her to Bhairavakona and in the process, Ghora is accidentally killed by Raghuveer. Raghuveer arrives by helicopter and asks Indu to come with him; however Indu sees Mithra's painting, and her past-life <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> revived; she reunites with Harsha.

5|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Riley and {{her parents}} move to San Francisco for her father's new business. Riley has poor first experiences: the new house is cramped and old, the moving van with all their {{belongings}} is misdirected, her father is under stress from his business, and a poor encounter at a pizza restaurant leaves her disheartened. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness accidentally causes Riley to cry {{in front of her}} class, creating a sad core memory. Joy, panicking, tries to dispose of it, but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> sucked out of Headquarters, and taken to the maze-like storage area of long-term memory.|$|E

Olivia visits Raul's wife Susan Lugo (Rosa Arredondo) and claims to have met her before as well, but Susan does not remember their meeting. She says the only people at a meeting Olivia describes were Raul, Susan, and John Scott (Mark Valley). Olivia realizes that she apparently still has his memories inside of her head, and is mixing them up with her own. Over at Massive Dynamic, Nina Sharp's (Blair Brown) attempts to delve into Scott's memories for information hit a dead end {{when they find out}} that crucial pieces of his <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> missing; they soon discover that the memories they need are in Olivia's mind.|$|E

Billie's <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> rekindled when she is finding the {{location}} of a demon named Dogan (Eric Steinberg) and recognizes similarities between him and Christy's kidnapper. After this revelation, Billie's storylines focus on her search for her sister; the Halliwells worry about Billie becoming obsessed with finding Christy as she takes more risks to get information, such as interrogating and torturing demons. Billie accuses her parents of choosing to forget Christy rather than trying to locate her. Billie's mother Helen (Barbara Niven) gives her Christy's diary, in which Billie finds a pentagram on the last page. The pentagram is a symbol for the demonic council known as Triad (Steven J. Oliver, Seren Oliver, and Leland Crooke). She eventually gains enough control over her powers to travel to the past, speak to Christy, and find her location.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> revealed.|$|E

He tries to overfeed it by offering {{the sum total of}} his Time Lord memories; Merry also leads the citizens in a song of hope, confusing Akhaten who then disappears. However, the Doctor's <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> not enough to sate the creature and Akhaten reappears. Clara returns to help, offering Akhaten the leaf that blew into her father's face on the day he met her mother, which contains an infinite amount of untold potential that Clara's mother never saw because she died early. Akhaten, overwhelmed by the infinite potential it has consumed, implodes on itself and the Rings are saved. The Doctor returns Clara to her home on the same day they left and gives her back her mother's ring, telling her that all the creatures she saved wanted her to have it back. Suddenly Clara remembers seeing the Doctor at her mother's funeral and asks why he was there. He tells her that she reminds him of someone who died and she rebukes him for using her as a replacement, but he assures her she is not a replacement and Clara leaves. However, the moment she is gone, the Doctor's expression becomes grim and closes the TARDIS door from which Clara left.|$|E
