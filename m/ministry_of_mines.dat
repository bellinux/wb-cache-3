25|$|Brazil is the 10th largest energy {{consumer}} in {{the world}} and the largest in South America. At the same time, it is an important oil and gas producer in the region and the world's second largest ethanol fuel producer. The governmental agencies responsible for energy policy are the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mines</b> and Energy (MME), the National Council for Energy Policy (CNPE, in the Portuguese-language acronym), the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) and the National Agency of Electricity (ANEEL). State-owned companies Petrobras and Eletrobrás are the major players in Brazil's energy sector, as well as Latin America's.|$|E
25|$|Generation {{capacity}} in Brazil {{is dominated by}} hydroelectric plants, which account for 77% of total installed capacity, with 24 plants above 1,000 MW. About 88 percent of the electricity fed into the national grid is estimated to come from hydroelectric generation, with over 25% coming from a single hydropower plant, the massive 14 GW Itaipu dam facility, located between Brazil and Paraguay on the Paraná River. Natural gas generation is second in importance, representing about 10% of total capacity, close to the 12% goal for 2010 established in 1993 by the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mines</b> and Energy.|$|E

The first car with an ethanol engine was produced in 1978 and the first airplane engine running on ethanol in 2005. Recent oil discoveries in the Pre-salt layer have {{opened the door for}} a large increase in oil production.

25|$|Well before 1976, Venezuela {{had taken}} several {{steps in the}} {{direction}} of nationalization of its oil industry. In August 1971, under the presidency of Rafael Caldera, a law was passed that nationalized the country's natural gas industry. Also in 1971 the law of reversion was passed which stated that all the assets, plant, and equipment belonging to concessionaires within or outside the concession areas would revert to the nation without compensation upon the expiration of the concession. The movement towards nationalism was experienced once again under decree 832. Decree 832 stipulated that all exploration, production, refining, and sales programs of the oil companies had to be approved in advance by the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mines</b> and Hydrocarbons.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} {{continued to}} push for development in the nuclear sector. It was the government's ambition to acquire all phases of the nuclear cycle through international cooperation. With this in mind, in 1974 the Brazilian Company for Nuclear Technology (Companhia Brasileira de Tecnologia Nuclear – CBTN) was enhanced and became the Brazilian Nuclear Enterprises (Nuclebrás). Headed by Paulo Nogueira Batista, a career diplomat, Nuclebrás was charged with implementing the nuclear program by promoting the creation of indigenous companies to build parts and offer services for the nuclear plants on the pipeline. While Nuclebrás dealt with implementation and funding, CNEN retained the responsibilities of nuclear planning, regulation and inspection. Additionally, CNEN continued to be the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mines</b> and Energy’s advisory body for domestic and international nuclear policy.|$|E

This venture {{collapsed}} when it emerged {{that the company had}} failed to secure the relevant permits from the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mines</b> and Development. A second diversification attempt, aimed at supplying food for the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, also ended abruptly when the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority accused ZDI of importing its rations without paying duties. Both the Zimbabwe National Army and Zimbabwe Republic Police also defaulted on payments for ammunition due to lack of funds, and it was widely reported that ZDI could no longer pay its workers. Employees claimed they had not received their wages for seven months. In response, the company sent most of its staff on forced leave.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{defining}} {{elements of the}} model adopted by the new administration is the establishment of energy auctions as the main procurement mechanism for distribution companies to acquire energy to serve their captive consumers. This initiative assisted in the introduction of competition in the power sector and also helped {{to address some of}} the existing market imperfections. Under this system, auctions of capacity from new generation projects will be held three to five years in advance of delivery dates. The <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mines</b> and Energy wants to ensure that the totality of future expansion needs is met and that plants are only built once they have won bids in energy auctions and are guaranteed long-term contracts. The first auction was held in December 2004, with contracts for a total of about 40GW traded.|$|E
25|$|Although {{much of the}} {{protected}} area is unspoiled with human intervention, logging of Gabonese redwood trees has increased considerably in recent years where roads have been built {{and there are two}} logging concessions in the area which could threaten the park in the future. Other threats to the park include low scale gold mining and hunting for crocodile skin, ivory or meat to sell in the cities of Gabon although this is relatively low. Hunting management is being implemented by a protocol signed within Gabon, between the Gabonese Ministry of Forestry Economy, the Governorate of the Woleu-Ntem Province, Bordamur and the villages in which are directly involved. The protocol acknowledges the interests of conservationists, loggers and local communities on matters relating to hunting and fishing. There is also a management strategy towards hunting activities in the north-eastern periphery of the park between the Ministry of Forestry Economy, the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mines,</b> and local representatives.|$|E
