[...] Biomarkers characterize disease progression starting from the earliest natural history of the disease. Biomarkers assess disease susceptibility and severity, which allows one to predict outcomes, determine interventions and evaluate therapeutic responses. From a forensics and epidemiologic perspective, biomarkers offer unique insight about the relationships between environmental risk factors.|$|E
5000|$|GAD67 is a {{key enzyme}} {{involved}} in the synthesis of inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and people with schizophrenia {{have been shown to}} express lower amounts of GAD67 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to healthy controls. [...] The mechanism underlying the decreased levels of GAD67 in people with schizophrenia remains unclear. Some have proposed that an immediate early gene, Zif268, which normally binds to the promoter region of GAD67 and increases transcription of GAD67, is lower in schizophrenic patients, thus contributing to decreased levels of GAD67. [...] Since the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is involved in working memory, and GAD67 and Zif268 mRNA levels are lower in the DLPFC of schizophrenic patients, this <b>molecular</b> <b>alteration</b> may account, at least in part, for the working memory impairments associated with the disease.|$|E
50|$|Using another genetically {{engineered}} mouse that lacks Sgol2 function, and siRNA experiments in oocytes, {{it has been}} shown that disruption of the mouse SGOL2 does not cause any alteration in sister chromatid cohesion in embryonic cultured fibroblasts and adult somatic tissues. Moreover, although these mutant mice also develop normally and survive to adulthood without any apparent alteration, both male and female Sgol2-deficient mice from this line are infertile. By different approaches it was demonstrated that SGOL2 is necessary for protecting centromeric cohesion during mammalian meiosis I. In vivo, the loss of SGOL2 promotes a premature release of the meiosis-specific REC8 cohesin complexes from anaphase I centromeres. This <b>molecular</b> <b>alteration</b> is manifested cytologically by the complete loss of centromere cohesion at metaphase II leading to single chromatids and physiologically with the formation of aneuploid gametes that give rise to infertility.|$|E

40|$|Severe {{combined}} immunodeficiency (SCID) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by defect of T- and B-cell immunity. In {{many cases of}} autosomal recessive SCID, thus far described, the <b>molecular</b> <b>alteration</b> involves genes encoding for molecules that participate in the signal transduction. We report on a patient affected by a {{combined immunodeficiency}}, characterized by severe T-cell functional impairment, {{in spite of a}} close to normal number of circulating mature type T and B cells. NK cells were absent. Associated with the immunodeficiency, this patient also showed short stature characterized by very low growth velocity, delayed bone age and absence of increase of the plasma levels of Insulin growth factor-I (IGF-I) after growth hormone (GH) in vivo stimulation indicating peripheral hyporesponsiveness to GH. Evaluation of the protein tyrosine phosphorylation events occurring following either T-cell receptor (TCR) or GH receptor (GHR) triggering revealed striking abnormalities. No <b>molecular</b> <b>alteration</b> of GHR gene was found, thus suggesting the presence of postreceptorial blockage. Mutational screening and expression analysis failed to reveal any <b>molecular</b> <b>alteration</b> of JAK 2 and STAT 5 A/B genes thus ruling out the involvement of these genes in the pathogenesis of this form of SCID. Mutational analysis of IL 2 Rg chain gene revealed the presence of a L 183 S missense mutation, thus indicating an atypical and a more complex clinical presentation of this X-linked form of SCID.

Several studies have demonstrated a high correlation of susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death with the existence of TWA. We describe a number of cellular and <b>molecular</b> <b>alterations</b> in the diseased heart that may provide a link between electrical and mechanical alternans and arrhythmia susceptibility. Repolarization alternans is likely the result of distinct and diverse cellular and <b>molecular</b> <b>alterations</b> that are associated with exaggerated regional repolarization heterogeneity, which renders the heart susceptible to malignant arrhythmias...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{variation}} was {{studied in}} several mouse L cell lines containing tandemly repeated {{herpes simplex virus}} thymidine kinase (TK) genes introduced by DNA-mediated gene transfer. Variants were obtained after alternate positive and negative selection for TK expression. Three classes of <b>molecular</b> <b>alteration</b> are described. One class consisted of a concerted wave of hypermethylation affecting many sites in all or {{nearly all of the}} TK genes. This resulted in genetically stable TK- variants. Of five TK+ transformants from independent transfer experiments, only one, named HM, showed this class of methylation. Hypermethylation was a reproducible phenomenon in HM, yielding TK- variants after selection with either bromodeoxyuridine or acycloguanosine [Acyclovir or 9 -(2 -hydroxyethy-oxymethyl) guanine]. A second class of alteration consisted of methylation affecting some, but not all, genes in the cluster. This happened in all TK+ (HAT [hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine]-resistant) cell lines investigated, and this second class of methylation was incapable of generating TK- variants. Neither type of methylation was accompanied by genomic rearrangements. The third class of <b>molecular</b> <b>alteration</b> was found among TK+ (HAT-resistant) back revertants of hypermethylated HM TK- derivatives. It consisted of a 10 -fold amplification of the hypermethylated TK genes. Demethylation of hypermethylated HM variants was not observed. Thus, hypermethylation in this system can be compensated for by amplification but cannot be reversed...|$|E

40|$|Glioblastoma is {{the most}} common and most {{aggressive}} primary brain tumor. Despite maximum treatment, patients only have a median survival time of 15  months, because of the tumor’s resistance to current therapeutic approaches.
