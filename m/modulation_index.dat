25|$|For {{the case}} of a carrier {{modulated}} by a single sine wave, the resulting frequency spectrum can be calculated using Bessel functions of the first kind, {{as a function of the}} sideband number and the <b>modulation</b> <b>index.</b> The carrier and sideband amplitudes are illustrated for different modulation indices of FM signals. For particular values of the <b>modulation</b> <b>index,</b> the carrier amplitude becomes zero and all the signal power is in the sidebands.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{sidebands}} are on {{both sides}} of the carrier, their count is doubled, and then multiplied by the modulating frequency to find the bandwidth. For example, 3kHz deviation modulated by a 2.2kHz audio tone produces a <b>modulation</b> <b>index</b> of 1.36. Suppose that we limit ourselves to only those sidebands that have a relative amplitude of at least 0.01. Then, examining the chart shows this <b>modulation</b> <b>index</b> will produce three sidebands. These three sidebands, when doubled, gives us (6 * 2.2kHz) or a 13.2kHz required bandwidth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract––This paper {{presents}} a generalized {{pulse width modulation}} (GPWM) algorithm for induction motor drives. In the proposed approach, by varying a constant (k 2) value from zero to one, various DPWM algorithms can be generated along with the SVPWM algorithm. As the proposed approach uses instantaneous phase voltages only for the calculation of gating times of the inverter, the complexity burden involved is very less {{when compared with the}} classical space vector approach. Then, the rms stator flux ripple, which is a measure of ripple in line current characteristics have been plotted for all the DPWM and SVPWM algorithms. From which, it is concluded that the SVPWM algorithm gives superior performance at low <b>modulation</b> <b>indices,</b> whereas the DPWM algorithm gives superior performance at higher <b>modulation</b> <b>indices.</b> Hence, to achieve the superior waveform quality at all <b>modulation</b> <b>indices,</b> a hybrid PWM (HPWM) algorithm has been presented in this paper.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel space-vector based Generalized Discontinuous {{pulse width modulation}} (GDPWM) algorithm without angle estimation based {{on the concept of}} imaginary switching times. The conventional space vector pulse width modulation (CSVPWM) method with equal division of zero state vectors V 0 and V 7 is modified. A constant-variable µ and modulation phase angle δ ranging from 0 to 1 are used to generate infinite number of modulating waveforms. Also, the classical triangle comparison approach is replaced by space vector approach. To avoid the complex coordinate transformations, trigonometric calculations and sector identification involved in CSVPWM, the concept of imaginary switching times is utilized. The imaginary switching times proportional to the reference phase voltages are used to calculate the actual switching times for reduced complexity and memory required. The proposed PWM technique results in reduced current ripple over the CSVPWM at high <b>modulation</b> <b>indices</b> and low switching losses at all <b>modulation</b> <b>indices.</b> To validate the proposed method, simulation is carried out on V/f controlled induction motor and the no-load current waveforms at different <b>modulation</b> <b>indices</b> and frequencies are presented and %THDs is compared...|$|R

2500|$|However it is {{possible}} to talk about a <b>modulation</b> <b>index</b> exceeding 100%, without introducing distortion, in the case of double-sideband reduced-carrier transmission. In that case, negative excursions beyond zero entail a reversal of the carrier phase, as shown in the third waveform below. This cannot be produced using the efficient high-level (output stage) modulation techniques (see below) which are widely used especially in high power broadcast transmitters. Rather, a special modulator produces such a waveform at a low level followed by a linear amplifier. What's more, a standard AM receiver using an envelope detector is incapable of properly demodulating such a signal. Rather, synchronous detection is required. Thus double-sideband transmission is generally not referred to as [...] "AM" [...] even though it generates an identical RF waveform as standard AM as long as the <b>modulation</b> <b>index</b> is below 100%.
