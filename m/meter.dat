Rhythm and <b>meter</b> are different, although closely related. <b>Meter</b> is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show <b>meter.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{damage is}} dealt by units within the CO zone, the CO's power <b>meter</b> fills slightly, {{at a rate}} of one bar per five hit points worth of damage inflicted. As the CO power <b>meter</b> is filled, the CO zone grows larger. When the <b>meter</b> is full, the CO can {{activate}} his power which has an effect on the whole battlefield, such as repairing allied units, damaging enemy units, or temporarily altering weather conditions. In addition, the offensive and defensive boosts that normally apply only in the CO zone, also applies to all allied units on the whole battlefield for the turn that the CO power is active. If the CO unit is destroyed, the CO <b>meter</b> empties and the CO returns to the HQ, able to be redeployed with another unit.|$|E

The length of each of Crash's lives is tied to his health <b>meter,</b> which {{decreases}} whenever Crash is damaged from enemy attacks or falls down a bottomless pit. The player can replenish Crash's health <b>meter</b> by instructing Crash to eat Wumpa Fruit. Each time the health <b>meter</b> is fully depleted, Crash loses a life. However, the player can win an additional life for Crash by collecting 25,000 units of the magical substance Mojo or by collecting a rare type of Golden Wumpa Fruit. After the last life is lost, the player can continue playing by restarting the current episode.|$|E

5|$|Each time a {{successful}} attack is performed on a player, their health <b>meter</b> depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. A player can increase their health {{by picking up}} food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. If a player {{does not have enough}} stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun <b>meter</b> only appears when the opponent is knocked down. It depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun <b>meter</b> is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun <b>meter</b> faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If a player is low on health, the stun <b>meter</b> will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them. Certain attacks to a stunned opponent will actually reset the stun <b>meter.</b>|$|E
5|$|From 1889 to 1960, the <b>meter</b> {{was defined}} as the length of a platinum-iridium (90:10) alloy bar, known as the International Prototype <b>Meter</b> bar.

5|$|Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers, found {{throughout}} the game in unmarked chests (white chests in Ascension), increase {{the maximum amount of}} health and magic, respectively. Minotaur Horns, which increase the Items and Fire meter's maximum length, are available in God of War III and Ghost of Sparta, respectively. The Items <b>meter</b> allows the use of secondary weapons, called Items, and the Fire <b>meter</b> allows the use of Thera's Bane. The meters are increased in increments and reach their maximum once a certain number of Eyes, Feathers, and Horns are found. Other chests contain green, blue, or red orbs. Green orbs replenish the player's health, blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage, and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic for new, more powerful attacks, and replenish the Rage <b>meter</b> in God of War. Gold orbs found in God of War II and Ascension, and white orbs in God of War III, replenish the Rage <b>meter</b> instead of red orbs; the Rage <b>meter</b> in Ascension is also refilled by landing attacks on foes. Chests with changing colors, which allow players to choose which <b>meter</b> to replenish, have also been available. Red orbs can also be collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. Bosses and more powerful opponents release a combination of colored orbs when killed via the quick-time feature.|$|E

5|$|Mario's health {{consists}} of a three-piece health <b>meter,</b> which is depleted through contact with enemies and hazards. When swimming underwater, Mario has an air supply <b>meter,</b> which quickly depletes his main health <b>meter</b> if it runs out. Mario's health and air supply can be restored by collecting coins, or through touching bubbles if underwater. When the health <b>meter</b> becomes empty, the player loses a life and must {{go back to a}} predetermined checkpoint. The health <b>meter</b> can be temporarily expanded to six units {{through the use of a}} Life Mushroom, with the maximum health returning to three units if the overall health falls to three units from enemy or hazard contact, or if Mario suffers instant death. Instant death can occur by being swallowed by quicksand or dark matter; falling into bottomless pits, which either consist of black holes or by leaving a planet's gravitational pull and falling into space. The player can obtain extra lives by collecting 1-Up Mushrooms, 50 coins without losing a life, or 50 Star Bits.|$|E

5|$|Originally the 1995 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships {{was planned}} to take place at Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre in Hamar, the same venue which hosted short track speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics. However, because Storhamar was at {{scheduled}} time playing play-offs in the Norwegian Ice Hockey Championship, it was in December 1994 decided to move the tournament to Gjøvik. The championship opened on Friday 17 March with the 1500 <b>meter</b> races, and {{was followed by the}} 500 <b>meter</b> races the following day. The remaining events were held on 19 March. It is the only time the world championship has been held in Norway. There were set six world records during the championship.

5|$|Sora, {{along with}} his allies, both possess a Hit Point (HP) <b>meter</b> and a Magic Point (MP) <b>meter,</b> which {{increase}} as they gain experience and level up. The MP <b>meter</b> is divided into various sections that are used up whenever that character performs magic, with more powerful magic using more MP. MP can be replenished by performing melee attacks or using items. The HP <b>meter</b> determines the character's health, reducing whenever a character takes damage, although it can be replenished by using healing items or spells. If one of Sora's allies runs out of health, they will be knocked out temporarily until someone heals them. However, if Sora loses all of his health, the game ends and the player must resume play {{from the beginning of}} an area or boss. Defeating enemies causes various orbs to fall; green orbs which replenish health, blue orbs which restore MP, and yellow orbs which represent Munny, the game's currency, which can be used to purchase new items.|$|E
