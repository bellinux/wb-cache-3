5000|$|Beginning in the 1920s aerosol {{measurements}} {{became more}} common place because the negative {{health effects of}} industrial aerosols and dust were starting to be recognized by health organization. [...] The major concern at this time was the increase in incidents of silicosis in industry and mine workers. The main methods for these measurements where based off Aitken’s simple <b>microscopic</b> <b>method.</b> It wasn't until the 1960s that aerosol measurement methods started to get more complex and involve the technological and instrumentation advancements of the time.|$|E
50|$|Estimating age {{at death}} for adults {{involves}} observing morphological features in the skeletal remains, comparing the information with changes recorded for recent populations of known age. With subadults, the development of teeth, length of long bones, and union of epiphyses are used to estimate age. With adults, age is measured through macroscopic and <b>microscopic</b> <b>methods.</b> Macroscopic methods do not involve destruction of the specimen while <b>microscopic</b> <b>methods</b> are more time intensive and require equipment, some destruction, and specialized knowledge.

50|$|The {{author has}} deemed it enlightening to reconsider this {{difficulty}} by placing {{it at the}} heart of legal theory instead of confining it to its periphery. This, in turn, implies a more in-depth analysis of the essential features of law in general from a new perspective. The author suggests that such an analysis requires a <b>microscopic</b> <b>method,</b> proceeding from the simple to the complex. He thus starts by describing minutely the smallest specific legal element and then shows how this irreducible particle enters, through a series of transformations and combinations, in the composition of any legal phenomenon.|$|E
5000|$|Detection of cryptococcal antigen (capsular material) by {{culture of}} CSF, sputum and urine {{provides}} definitive diagnosis. [...] Blood cultures may be positive in heavy infections. India ink of the CSF {{is a traditional}} <b>microscopic</b> <b>method</b> of diagnosis, although the sensitivity is poor in early infection, and may miss 15-20% of patients with culture-positive cryptococcal meningitis. [...] Unusual morphological forms are rarely seen. Cryptococcal antigen from cerebrospinal fluid is the best test for diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis in terms of sensitivity. Apart from conventional methods of detection like direct microscopy and culture, rapid diagnostic methods to detect cryptococcal antigen by latex agglutination test, lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFA), or enzyme immunoassay (EIA). A new cryptococcal antigen LFA was FDA approved in July 2011. [...] Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used on tissue specimens.|$|E

Lack of accurate <b>microscopic</b> <b>method,</b> which only can work with minimal amounts of blood at the time made it impossible to systematically explore the work of enzymes in normal and pathological condition of the body. A method which was created and later has received the name of the Bach-Zubkova, allowed to work with one cubic millimeter of blood (a drop of blood, approximately, with a small pin head). At the request of the Institute ten special calorimeters were built, which are provided to hospitals for systematic studies. According to Professor Yaroslav S.
