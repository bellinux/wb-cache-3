When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that if something goes wrong, they won't <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> she doesn't want to put them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for a fetal surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument in the waiting room, and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her a taste of the freedom that she has been missing.

25|$|Pottery {{has a long}} {{tradition}} that extends into the pre-Hispanic period. Oaxaca shares many pottery types with other parts of Mexico along with two of its own: barro negro and the green glazed pottery of Atzompa. The first is centered in the town of San Bartolo Coyotepec near the capital city. This pottery gets its color from the local clay used to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> its shine from a technique developed by Doña Rosa Nieto in the mid-20th century. The Atompa green-glazed ware is made much the same way it was in colonial times, although there have been some recent innovations with color and decorative techniques. This pottery is found in Santa María Atzompa, near Oaxaca city.|$|E

All new aircraft were supposed to be first tested by the control officer, who also received a 500 Norwegian kroner (NOK) fee for each such test. However, as Høver felt that the aircraft seemed to work fine, he made a 20-minute flight, being very pleased with its performance when he landed. The issue was kept secret, and Østby could make the official first flight and collect his 500 NOK on 17 July.|$|E

500|$|Adverse winds {{as well as}} {{damaged and}} leaky boats slowed the American fleet's progress. At Schuyler Island, Providence and Jersey were sunk or burned, and crude repairs were {{effected}} to other vessels.

By the following morning, the ships were still more than [...] from Crown Point, and the British fleet's masts were visible on the horizon. When the wind finally changed, the British had its advantage first. They closed once again, opening fire on Congress and Washington, which were {{in the rear of}} the American fleet.

Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about that. It just seemed like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt.

500|$|Crime Cutz {{has been}} {{described}} by Lily Moayeri of Under the Radar as an EP that strongly showcases the nu-disco side of the duo. The music of the EP was influenced by records by Russian jazz musicians that were released in the 1970s and 1980s but were never distributed in the duo's home country; these musicians attempted to copy the disco style of American and French acts such as Chic. Frankel, who was sent mp3 files of these tracks by a Russian record dealer on eBay, said that their failure to mimic the style of the popular songs they wanted to recreate due to their different synthesizer sounds is what made the songs unique: [...] "I guess that's kind of what Nick and I do ... We find a sound we like, try to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> fail, but in the process we make something new." [...] The rhythm of each track was developed first before writing the melodies and lyrics, given that the main goal of the EP was for it to be [...] "instantly rhythmically gratifying", as member Nick Millhiser described. In addition to its disco element, Crime Cutz features exaggerated arrangements and childlike R vocals that gives it a 1980s-esque atmosphere. Consequence of Sound's David Sackllah noted Crime Cutz to be Holy Ghost!'s cleanest-sounding release to date. As for the lyrical content, Frankel wanted the songs' seductive lyrics to be [...] "phonetically fun" [...] as with most other disco records.|$|E

They ultimately settled for Sky, as the network was [...] "the one that we believed would let us do what we wanted". In January 2012, Glenister believed their decision to go with Sky was [...] "vindicated", as the terrestrial networks would restrict its content, violence, and language. He stated that the restrictions would not make the series [...] "the show it is and it wouldn't be the show we wanted to make". Head of Sky Drama Elaine Pyke had an immediate interest in the project, as she was [...] "immediately grabbed by how thrilling, scary, and funny it is", believing it to be [...] "the perfect show for Sky1".
