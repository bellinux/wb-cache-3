[...] Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that the film [...] "has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop." [...] The film did receive notable pans from several major reviewers. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker called the film [...] "Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell."

Robert Hofler of Variety criticized Sellars for using body microphones to amplify the singing, thus compensating for the [...] "vocally distressed" [...] Maddalena. He further complained that the director, known for designing unorthodox settings for the operas he has staged (Hofler mentions The Marriage of Figaro in the New York Trump Tower and Don Giovanni in an urban slum), here uses visually uninteresting, overly realistic sets {{for the first two}} acts. Hofler felt that it was time that the opera received a fresh approach: [...] "Having finally arrived at the Met, Nixon in China has traveled the world. It is a masterpiece, a staple of the opera repertory, and now it simply deserves a new look". However, Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times, while noting that Maddalena's voice was not as strong as it had been at the world premiere, maintained that due to his long association with the role, it would have been impossible to bring the opera to the <b>Met</b> with <b>anyone</b> else as Nixon: [...] "Maddalena inhabits the character like no other singer".

Initially, the list of people was short, and time passed for nearly a year before <b>anyone</b> <b>met</b> or organized a kick. Emails were exchanged discussing the club and what we should name it, along with several aborted weekend kicks. As other teams across the country were sprouting up they were able to secure a sister-club relationship with an AFL club back in Oz. Jones negotiated a deal with the Western Bulldogs who promised a set of used jumpers. After many emails, and phone calls, the inaugural kick was set for the Sunday of the Labor Day weekend of 1998, at Denver’s City Park. Two people, Craig Jones, and Jim Baldwin were the only attendee. The following week, a Saturday, Jones, Baldwin, and Dainauski were joined by more founding members of the club, Rusty Waugh, Paul Renouf, John Hevko, Charley Ellis, Greg Merritt, and Mick Daly.Week after week, more people showed up; skills were the focus, as many had never played a game of footy before. Craig Jones was elected President, Jonas Stoltz VP, Paul Renouf Secretary, and Mick Daly Treasurer. The club was slowly becoming organized.Finally, in early October 1998, the first Aussie Football match was played in Denver. On a shortened oval, two teams of 12 faced off: ‘Renouf’s Rejects’ versus the ‘Presidents team’. Stoltz initiated the setup of the Bulldogs club website, Craig Jones had T-shirts made up, and the Bulldogs were gaining an identity.|$|R
