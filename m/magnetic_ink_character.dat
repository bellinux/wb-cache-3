500|$|In the 1950s, SRI {{worked under}} the {{direction}} of the Bank of America to develop ERMA (Electronic Recording Machine, Accounting) and <b>magnetic</b> <b>ink</b> <b>character</b> recognition (MICR). The ERMA project was led by computer scientist Jerre Noe, who was at the time SRI's assistant director of engineering. [...] As of 2011, MICR remains the industry standard in automated check processing.|$|E
2500|$|Digital {{microtext}} printers utilize {{specially designed}} fonts and ink for the purpose. [...] The ink used is most commonly MICR (<b>Magnetic</b> <b>Ink</b> <b>Character</b> Recognition) toner particles {{but may also}} be polyester based toners and styrene acrylate polymer based toners. [...] The ink {{is not limited to}} grayscale only, but may also use color toners or even more specialized toners containing dyes sensitive to ultraviolet or infrared radiation and producing fluorescence when exposed to those radiations.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Patrick Hanratty {{was making}} similar {{developments}} at GE {{as part of}} their partnership with G&L on the Numericord. His language, PRONTO, beat APT into commercial use when it was released in 1958. Hanratty then went on to develop MICR <b>magnetic</b> <b>ink</b> <b>characters</b> that were used in cheque processing, before moving to General Motors to work on the groundbreaking DAC-1 CAD system.|$|R
50|$|IBM {{introduced}} the 3890 High Speed Document Processor in 1973. This {{piece of equipment}} is used by financial institutions to sort and tally all cheques, utility payment and gift certificates {{at the end of}} each banking day. The machine reads the <b>magnetic</b> <b>ink</b> <b>characters</b> (MICR) and/or the optical characters (OCR) that are encoded on the bottom of each document. This code line facilitates totalling the cheques and sorting them into pockets. The document process is designed to feed at a rate of 2400 six inch cheques per minute.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the speed}} with which they can be read by {{computer}} systems, <b>magnetic</b> <b>ink</b> <b>character</b> recognition is used extensively in banking, primarily for personal checks. The ink used in <b>magnetic</b> <b>ink</b> <b>character</b> recognition (MICR) technology is also used to greatly reduce errors in automated (or computerized) reading.|$|E

40|$|The {{motivation}} for {{this paper is}} a problem faced by banks which process large volumes of deposited checks. The checks must be separated by bank number before shipment to the Federal Reserve or other banks. The sorting is usually accomplished using a reader-sorter which reads the <b>magnetic</b> <b>ink</b> <b>characters</b> on the checks and separates them into different "pockets. " This paper characterizes the optimal sorting strategy and describes an efficient procedure for finding the optimal solution for problems of the size generally found in practice. The algorithm {{is based on a}} two state dynamic programming recursion in which characterization theorems are used to drastically reduce the size of the state space and in which the storage requirements are minimal. The paper includes an analysis of computational experience and describes how the algorithm {{can be used in a}} real time environment with deadlines. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{bounds of}} the design space for 3 D-printed objects {{continue}} to rapidly extend as the library of printable materials continues to grow. This thesis explores printed objects uniquely enabled {{by the addition of}} a <b>magnetic</b> <b>ink</b> to the existing repertoire of materials for the MultiFab printer, a high-resolution, multi-material inkjet 3 D printer. Magnetic nanoparticles, a base ink, and a dispersion method are selected to develop the <b>magnetic</b> <b>ink.</b> The ink is optimized for maximal magnetic content and its magnetic properties are characterized. A 9. 7 ± 0. 8 wt% magnetite ink with expected stability exceeding 10 days is achieved. Design, characterization, and validation of two small-scale multi-material actuators driven by magnetism is performed. The first actuator is a simple fixed cantilever, while the second is a tilting panel. More advanced structures and actuators are explored and are suggestive of an extremely wide scope for potential future applications. The fields of application shown for 3 D-printable <b>magnetic</b> <b>ink</b> in a multi-material context range from biomimicry (e. g. stimuli-responsive surfaces) to optics and aerodynamics. by Louise E. van den Heuvel.
