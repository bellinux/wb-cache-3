Its operation is based on the following principles: voluntary, equality of the parties, neutrality of the mediator, exclusion of the public, efficiency of the procedure, confidentiality of information, fairness.

A popular dispute resolution technique used in IJV’s is arbitration; however, many times a court process is given priority as this system has more authority.

40|$|Objective The {{concepts}} and associated analyses of <b>mediation</b> <b>and</b> moderation {{are important to}} the field of psychology. Although pediatric psychologists frequently incorporate <b>mediation</b> <b>and</b> moderation in their theo-ries and empirical research, on few occasions have we integrated <b>mediation</b> <b>and</b> moderation. In this article, conceptual reasons for integrating <b>mediation</b> <b>and</b> moderation are offered. Method We illustrate a model that integrates <b>mediation</b> <b>and</b> moderation. Results In our illustration, the strength of an indirect or a mediating effect varied as a function of a moderating variable. Conclusions Clinical implications of the integration of <b>mediation</b> <b>and</b> moderation are discussed, as is the potential of integrated models to advance research programs in pediatric psychology.

The Commission for Conciliation, <b>Mediation</b> <b>and</b> Arbitration endeavours first and foremost to conciliate between the parties. If it is unsuccessful in this, the matter moves on to arbitration. The entire process is very informal, and at no charge, and is therefore very accessible to labourers, who often utilise it: About 300 new cases are brought before the Commission for Conciliation, <b>Mediation</b> <b>and</b> Arbitration daily. In addition to the Commission for Conciliation, <b>Mediation</b> <b>and</b> Arbitration, 1995 saw the introduction of bargaining councils, which allow for communication across the industry. A bargaining council is organised collectively and voluntarily, and must be registered. In order to be registered, an alternative-dispute-resolution mechanism, similar to the Commission for Conciliation, <b>Mediation</b> <b>and</b> Arbitration, must be put in place.|$|R
