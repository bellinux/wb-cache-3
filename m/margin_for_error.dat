Frequency reproduction is always strictly {{less than half of}} the sampling frequency, and imperfect filters require a larger <b>margin</b> <b>for</b> <b>error</b> (noise level versus sharpness of filter), so an 8kHz sampling rate limits the maximum frequency to 4kHz, while a 48kHz sampling rate limits an MP3 to a maximum 24kHz sound reproduction.

25|$|Until March 2008, the International Tennis Federation (ITF), Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Women's Tennis Association (WTA), Grand Slam Committee, {{and several}} {{individual}} tournaments had conflicting rules on how Hawk-Eye {{was to be}} utilised.

On 19 March 2008, the aforementioned organizing bodies announced a uniform system of rules: three unsuccessful challenges per set, with an additional challenge if the set reaches a tiebreak. In an advantage set (a set with no tiebreak) players are allowed three unsuccessful challenges every 12 games.

However, in his third season in 2006, Stoops led the Wildcats to an improved 6–6 record, the first non-losing season for the school since 1998 when the Wildcats went 12–1. In 2008, the Wildcats earned their first bowl berth in a decade, defeating BYU by a score of 31–21. In 2009, the Wildcats earned their second straight bowl berth and a second straight eight-win season. On November 21, 2009, the Oregon Ducks came to Arizona Stadium in a game that would decide which team went to the Rose Bowl. ESPN's College GameDay crew dubbed it as the game of the week and ventured down to Tucson to cover it. After a back and forth battle, the Oregon Ducks won in double overtime 44–41 to clinch the Rose Bowl bid. Arizona was defeated 33–0 by Nebraska in a rematch of the 1998 Holiday Bowl. Following the Holiday Bowl, offensive coordinator Sonny Dykes left the Wildcat program to become the head coach at Louisiana Tech, and {{defensive coordinator}} Mark Stoops, a brother of Mike, became the defensive coordinator at Florida State. To replace them, Mike Stoops promoted Bill Bedenbaugh and Seth Littrell to co-offensive coordinators, while promoting Tim Kish to be co-defensive coordinators with Greg Brown, who was hired from Colorado.|$|E

500|$|It {{quickly became}} {{apparent}} that Elephant Island, [...] of rock and ice with little shelter, was not a welcoming environment particularly with winter approaching {{and most of the}} expedition members weakened by their ordeal. Furthermore, the expedition could not be expected to be spotted by search parties or passing whalers. Within days of landing on Elephant Island, Shackleton decided to take a small party and sail the largest lifeboat, the James Caird, named for one of the expedition's sponsors, to South Georgia, [...] away. From there he would obtain a ship and return for the remainder of his men. [...] Worsley, whose navigational skills had impressed Shackleton, volunteered to accompany him.

50|$|When CBTC {{is applied}} to systems that {{previously}} ran under complete human control with operators working on sight it may actually result in a reduction in capacity (albeit {{with an increase in}} safety).

For instance, CBTC introduction in Philly's Center City trolley tunnel resulted initially in a marked increase in travel time and corresponding decrease in capacity when compared with the unprotected manual driving. This was the offset to finally eradicate vehicle collisions which on-sight driving cannot avoid and showcases the usual conflicts between operation and safety.|$|R

40|$|Background: STN-DBS {{is now a}} key {{treatment}} {{choice for}} advanced Parkinson’s disease. The optimum target area within the STN is well established. However, no emphasis {{on the impact of}} trajectory exists. The ellipsoid shape of the STN and the off-centre traditional target point mean that variation in the electrode inclination should affect STN engagement. Understanding of this relationship could inform trajectory selection during planning by improving STN engagements and <b>margins</b> <b>for</b> <b>error.</b> Methods: We simulated electrode placement at the clinical target through a set of trial trajectories. Twelve 3 D-reconstructed STNs were created from MRI data of 6 patients. An appropriate target within each STN was then chosen. Each STN was approached through 56 simulated trajectories arranged in a grid covering a quadrant of skull around and in front of the coronal suture. A subset of 20 viable trajectories was reassessed for depth of engagement in each STN whilst approaching the chosen target. Results: Group averages for each trajectory are presented as traffic light maps and as an overlaid skull mask illustrating recommended electrode entry sites. Trajectories under 30 degrees anterior to the bregma and between 10 to 30 degrees off the midline accommodated over 2. 4 degrees of wobble. A mean engagement of 6 mm was possible in half of the subset. The longest engagements are on trajectories which saddle the coronal suture, extending to 40 degrees lateral. Microelectrode tracts of 14 additional STNs were collated using above protocol and engagement exceeded 5 mm in all central trajectories without capsular side effects, suggesting placement away from STN borders. Conclusions: Trajectory selection influences engagement and flexibility to accommodate electrode wobble or brain shift whilst approaching a chosen STN target. We recommend having the first trial trajectory 20 degrees anterior to the bregma, moving postero-laterally in successive trials to balance both error and engagement. When wider <b>margins</b> <b>for</b> <b>error</b> are beneficial (e. g. second side during bilateral procedures), trajectories nearer the coronal suture and around 25 degrees off the midline are advised...|$|R
