5|$|In May 1900, Teuruarii journeyed {{with a few}} island dignitaries to Papeete on the {{invitation}} of Gustave Gallet, the French governor, to discuss the possibility of annexing the island. On May 11, Teuruarii signed a statement of annexation, officially bringing Rurutu under French control. Months later, the L'Aube brought Gallet to Rurutu, where he officially took possession of the island. On August 25, in a formal ceremony witnessed by Governor Gallet, the officers of the L'Aube, the French officials aboard, the former king and the native population, {{the flag of the}} protectorate was lowered and the French tricolor raised in its place; this <b>moment,</b> <b>like</b> the ceremony of 1888, was celebrated by a 21-gun salute from the French vessel.|$|E

500|$|... "Miss Independent" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics, who lauded Clarkson for distancing herself from her American Idol persona, but criticized the song's resemblance {{to some of}} the songs on Stripped— particularly [...] "Dirrty" [...] and [...] "Fighter" [...] (2002). On its release, Brian Hiatt of Entertainment Weekly noted that [...] "its hard R sound may shock fans who embraced the mellow [...] "A <b>Moment</b> <b>Like</b> This." [...] "Miss Independent" [...] begins with Clarkson singing in a throaty moan over a bangin' hip-hop beat, then bursts into a power-chord-propelled, disco-diva chorus that's not unlike Britney Spears' [...] "Stronger"." [...] Rolling Stone wrote, [...] ""A <b>Moment</b> <b>Like</b> This" [...] was exactly the sort of treacly by-the-numbers ballad critics expected of a TV-contest winner; that's probably why its assertive follow-up, [...] "Miss Independent," [...] was such a surprise." [...] AllMusic's senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that it [...] "managed to make Kelly Clarkson seem younger and hipper without slutting her up like Christina Aguilera (who, ironically, co-wrote [...] "Miss Independent," [...] the first single from Thankful) while retaining a strong sense of melodic songcraft." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the song [...] "gives Clarkson the youthful edge she desperately needs to balance out the Adult Contemporary goo of songs like [...] "Anytime" [...] and [...] "A <b>Moment</b> <b>Like</b> This." [...] Cinquemani also added, [...] ""Miss Independent" [...] is no [...] "Dirrty," [...] but it proves that if anyone can out-sing Aguilera, it's Clarkson." [...] On March 5, 2013, Billboard ranked the it the number sixteen in its list of [...] "Top 100 American Idol Hits of All Time".|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on Ten started as {{instrumental}} compositions that Vedder added lyrics to after he joined the band. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "All I really believe in is this fucking <b>moment,</b> <b>like</b> right now. And that, actually, is what the whole album talks about." [...] Vedder's lyrics for Ten deal with subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. The album also tackles social concerns such as homelessness ("Even Flow") {{and the use of}} psychiatric hospitals ("Why Go"). The song [...] "Jeremy" [...] and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates.|$|E

500|$|In {{accordance}} with the Marxist doctrine that history is made by collective action, not individuals, Eisenstein forbore to single out any person in his film, but rather focused on the [...] "mass protagonist". Soviet film critics hailed this approach, including the dramaturge and critic, Adrian Piotrovsky, writing for the Leningrad newspaper Krasnaia gazeta: The hero is the sailors' battleship, the Odessa crowd, but characteristic figures are snatched here and there from the crowd. For a <b>moment,</b> <b>like</b> a conjuring trick, they attract all the sympathies of the audience: like the sailor Vakulinchuk, like the young woman and child on the Odessa Steps, but they emerge only to dissolve once more into the mass.

[...] "Lose Yourself" [...] is also the longest-running Oscar-winning number-one song since singer-actor Bing Crosby's [...] "White Christmas" [...] had 14 weeks on top in the 1940s.

"There was {{one moment}} in the Six-Day War which symbolized the great victory: that was the moment in which the first paratroopers – under Gur's command – reached the stones of the Western Wall, feeling the emotion of the place; there never was, and never will be, another <b>moment</b> <b>like</b> it. Nobody staged that moment. Nobody planned it in advance. Nobody {{prepared}} it and nobody was prepared for it; {{it was as if}} Providence had directed the whole thing: the paratroopers weeping — loudly and in pain — over their comrades who had fallen along the way, the words of the Kaddish prayer heard by Western Wall's stones after 19 years of silence, tears of mourning, shouts of joy, and the singing of [...] "Hatikvah"".|$|E

500|$|It was {{suggested}} that the song {{would become one of}} the biggest-selling releases of the decade, with HMV spokesman Gennaro Castaldo saying: [...] "This is proving {{to be one of the}} biggest single releases for years if not the decade. Only Leona Lewis's debut hit [...] "A <b>Moment</b> <b>Like</b> This", which sold over 500,000 copies in its first week, can compare. It's selling more than most Christmas No 1s would, and HMV has placed an urgent order for more copies." [...] On December 28, 2008, the UK Singles Chart listed it as the second biggest selling single for the year end countdown and the nineteenth best-selling single of the decade. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified the song double-platinum, denoting shipments of over 1.2 million copies within the country.|$|E
500|$|Lewis {{performed}} a nineteen-song set list with a four-piece band and two backup vocalists.

Many singled out her performance of [...] "Ave Maria" [...] as the set's highlight, while others also praised renditions of [...] "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face", [...] "A <b>Moment</b> <b>Like</b> This" [...] and [...] "Run". Several noted that {{nearly a third of}} the set list consisted of both official covers recorded by Lewis previously included on her albums, as well as cover songs intended just for the tour. Some were complimentary of the unofficial covers, most notably Lewis' version of [...] "Time After Time" [...] by Cyndi Lauper, whereas others felt that there were too many and that they were too forgettable.|$|E

Director Rob Cohen revealed that in Curry's draft, the character of Noah was younger, but he made the conscious decision to age him to 19, because he felt as if it was [...] "not healthy" [...] and that audiences would lose sympathy for the protagonist.
