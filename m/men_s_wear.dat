40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} development of the children 2 ̆ 7 s ready-to-wear industry between 1920 and 1969 from the point-of-view of industry insiders, including significant manufacturers, designers, and trade journalists. The goal {{of this study was to}} analyze an idea proposed by industry designer Robert Love during the mid- 1960 s. Love believed that the first two phases of the evolution of the children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wear</b> industry were (1) the establishment of large children 2 ̆ 7 s ready-to-wear manufacturing firms; and (2) the growth in influence of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wear</b> specialist designers during the 1950 s and 1960 s. This study draws from the history of children 2 ̆ 7 s ready-to-wear firm Joseph Love, Inc. as well as the careers of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wear</b> specialist designers Helen Lee, Suzanne Godart, and Betsy Daniels in order to examine the two stages of industry development and evaluate the accuracy of Love 2 ̆ 7 s statement. Through an analysis of trade and popular publications, archival collections, and oral histories, this research identifies and explores the marketing, branding, and advertising strategies employed during each period. During the purported first phase, the building of brand names was crucial to the success of the children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wear</b> manufacturers operating within a new industry. Establishing strong and recognizable brand names was also a precursor to the rise of designer names in association with children 2 ̆ 7 s clothing. Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wear</b> designers of the 1950 s and 1960 s frequently worked under the auspices of major children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wear</b> brands. Themes of manufacturing, marketing, and designer and brand recognition inform this study of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wear</b> firms and designers, as this research begins to contextualize the growth of designer branding in the children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wear</b> industry...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} South African <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement {{and the possible}} influences of {{various factors such as}} demographic characteristics, expenditure on clothing, the frequency of clothing purchases, store patronage and <b>men</b> <b>s</b> work dress code. A survey was conducted across Gauteng which is the largest retail hub in South Africa with mainly urban areas. Most consumers in Gauteng have access to different clothing retailers. Consulta Research, a professional research company assisted with data collection. Data was collected by means of convenient sampling. Online questionnaires were distributed to their data base and a total of 479 usable questionnaires were completed. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, ANOVA s, Chi square tests and other post hoc tests. The study confirmed that men clothing involvement is not equally strong for all four dimensions of clothing involvement that are distinguished in literature. Previous studies suggested that involvement should be studied from an age ordering perspective, and therefore respondents demographic characteristics were vital in terms of the analysis of the data. Certain demographic characteristics seemed to be good indicators of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement, namely age and marital status while factors such as work dress code surprisingly {{do not seem to be}} useful to predict <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement. The majority of the sample spent less than 5 % of their monthly household income on clothing for themselves and indicated that they purchase clothing sporadically when necessary. Findings nevertheless indicated that expenditure on their clothing and frequency of clothing purchases are useful indicators of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement. Although younger men (generation Y) were more inclined to patronise specialised <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing retailers, irrespective of their work dress code, the majority of men patronised general retailers and department stores when purchasing their clothing. Findings confirm that consumption- and purchase involvement are the prevalent forms of clothing involvement that are relevant in terms of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing behaviour. Indications are that <b>men</b> <b>s</b> advertising involvement is not particularly strong, which implies that they gain their product information and fashion information from alternative sources that rather relates to purchase involvement which tested high in most cases. This has implications for retail because <b>men</b> <b>s</b> stronger purchase involvement probably means that the physical retail environment is more important in terms of fashion information and to inspire <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing purchases. Therefore retailers should focus more on factors that make in-store decisions easier for males such as displays and placement of clothing. Male apparel is a potentially lucrative and growing market that can be even more profitable. Younger men spend more on their clothing therefore this group should therefore take preference but the older men should not be forgotten. Based on the findings of this study various recommendations are made with a large focus to either expand this study or build onto this existing research. Topics related to male clothing and involvement of clothing can definitely be built on and studied more in the apparel industry to fill a gap on knowledge that is lacking and should be explored further.

50|$|The Ching {{family is}} an {{affluent}} family that produces textiles for the royal family, the {{government officials and}} the army during the Tang Dynasty.

To insult the Ching's family gift to Princess <b>Man</b> <b>Sing,</b> Lady Gwai had the fabric laid {{on the floor as}} a carpet for Princess <b>Man</b> <b>Sing</b> to step on during her wedding ceremony. Seeing none of the Tibetan girls present at the ceremony being attractive, Lady Gwai suggest to the Tang Emperor that the Ching family take a Tibetan girl as their daughter-in-law to better relations with the new royal in-laws. 2nd madam Ching could not refuse the request since the Tang Emperor had agreed to Lady Gwai's suggestion.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} Indian {{middle class}} <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear {{of violence in}} public spaces. It attempts to broaden {{the perspective of the}} implications of fear of violence. Both the public and academic discourses on violence in public spaces in India are centered on the notion of the female victim. In this thesis I argue that we need to open up a strict binary understanding of only women as vulnerable and affected by the fear of crime in public spaces. I discuss the gendered implications of different types of violence, and how different identity categories that cut across gender, have an impact on middle class <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear. In addition to this I assess how the fear for others safety and the masculine ideal of being a protector has an impact on <b>men</b> <b>s</b> personal fear of violence. Because there is no research on <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear of crime in an Indian context I have supported my analyses with three theoretical frameworks, all relevant in different ways. This is the research on masculinity in India, the research on men and fear from the West, and the research on middle class women and fear of crime in India. My own research consists of data collected through a survey where 98 men and women participated, and interviews with men who are involved in initiatives for safer cities. To understand how fear of violence in public spaces is affecting lives in India, it is necessary to not restrict ourselves to only women s narratives. This thesis is an attempt at putting <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear of violence on the agenda, and hopefully it contributes to a widening of the understanding of fear of violence in public spaces...|$|R
