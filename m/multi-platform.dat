By early February, the game sold 102,779 units, coming in second overall to The Last Story for the Wii. By {{the end of}} the year, the game had sold just over 152,500 units.|$|E
5|$|Episode Two was {{developed}} simultaneously with Episode One by a development {{team led by}} David Speyrer. This schedule of simultaneous development aided them in streamlining the story between the two games to create an immersive story. The technology used was the same for both games, allowing the development teams to quickly fix any technical problems that might arise from either game; this happened often because of the <b>multi-platform</b> release.|$|E

5|$|Chartjackers {{garnered}} a viewing figures peak {{of almost}} half a million with its final episode and was critically panned by reviewers. Some commentators felt that the programme's concept was ridiculous and doomed from the start, others felt that the series showed a contempt for music and the general public, and other critics questioned whether {{the point of the}} project was to raise money for charity or for the four bloggers to promote themselves. The show was nominated for a 2010 Broadcast Digital Award in the Best <b>Multi-Platform</b> Project category, but lost out to The Operation...Surgery Live.|$|E
5|$|Computer {{role-playing}} games (CRPGs) {{are once}} again popular. Recent titles, such as BioWare's Mass Effect series and Bethesda Softworks' The Elder Scrolls series, have been produced for console systems and have received <b>multi-platform</b> releases, although independently developed games are frequently created as personal computer (PC) exclusives. Developers of role-playing games have continuously experimented with various graphical perspectives and styles of play, such as real-time and turn-based time-keeping systems, axonometric and first-person graphical projections, and single-character or multi-character parties. Subgenres include action role-playing games, roguelikes and tactical role-playing games.|$|E
5|$|Development for {{multiple}} platforms is profitable, but difficult. Optimizations needed for one platform architecture {{do not necessarily}} translate to others. Individual platforms such as the Sega Genesis and PlayStation 3 are seen as difficult to develop for compared to their competitors, and developers are not yet fully accustomed to new technologies such as multi-core processors and hyper-threading. <b>Multi-platform</b> releases are increasingly common, but not all differences between editions on multiple platforms can be fully explained by hardware alone, and there remain franchise stalwarts that exist solely on one system. Developers for new platforms such as handheld and mobile systems {{do not have to}} operate under the pressure of $20 million budgets and the scrutiny of publishers' marketing experts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Application on <b>multi-platforms</b> for a {{computer-aided}} {{fixture design}} (CAFD) system is significant. But now, relative less {{attention is focused}} on this direction. On above backgrounds, research was carried out on data construction, data description, data conversation as well as data parsing. In modular fixture system, components in the modular fixture base were described according to their CSG-based primitives. So, XML was used to represent the simple data because of its widely using on net and different operational systems. By developing interfaces between diverse CAD systems, the modular fixture system can be applied on heterogeneous environments and reinventing the wheel can be avoided...|$|R
5|$|<b>Multi-platform</b> {{releases}} {{were common}} {{in the early days}} of RPGs, but there was a period during the 1990s when this was not generally the case. The sixth generation of home gaming consoles led many game developers to resume the practice, and some opted to develop primarily or exclusively for consoles. The combination of the Xbox and DirectX technologies proved especially popular due to the two systems' architectural similarities, as well as their common set of programming tools. Multimedia and art assets, which account for a greater proportion of the development budget than in the past, are easily transferable between multiple platforms.|$|E
5|$|Sequels {{to many of}} {{the above}} titles were also {{developed}} for next-gen systems, including Lionhead's Fable II (2008) and Fable III (2010). The Fallout and Baldur's Gate series of PC RPGs spawned console-friendly, Diablo-style action titles for the PS2 and Xbox as their respective PC series ended. Bethesda's Oblivion was released simultaneously for console and PC, but was considered a major launch title for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. BioWare continued to produce launch-exclusive RPG titles for the Xbox 360, such as Mass Effect (2007) and Mass Effect 2 (2010); and released the <b>multi-platform</b> Dragon Age series starting in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Chartjackers was devised in 2009 by Davenport and Andy Mettam of Hat Trick Productions, and was {{commissioned}} for development by Geoffrey Goodwin and Jo Twist of BBC Switch. Alongside the programmes Off the Hook and The Cut, it was featured {{as part of}} a season of <b>multi-platform</b> content designed to appeal to teenagers. The show was also directly linked to the 2009 annual appeal for the British charity Children in Need – profits from sales of the completed pop song were donated to the charity. Chartjackers aired weekly at approximately 1:10p.m. on Saturday afternoons on BBC Two, with the first episode premiering on 12 September 2009 during the channel's two-hour long BBC Switch segment. The series garnered a viewing figures peak of almost half a million with its final episode and was critically panned by reviewers.

It was voted the 22nd-best game of all time in 2006 by readers of the Japanese magazine Famitsu. The game was a commercial success; 13 weeks after its release, Final Fantasy VIII had earned more than US$50 million in sales, making it the fastest-selling Final Fantasy title until Final Fantasy XIII, a <b>multi-platform</b> release. It was ported to Microsoft Windows in 2000 and re-released via Steam in 2013 and in Japan during 2014. It was re-released worldwide as a PSOne Classic on the PlayStation Store in 2009 compatible with PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable with support for PlayStation Vita coming in 2012.

40|$|Computer based {{controllers}} {{are being}} used increasingly {{in every aspect of}} modern life and have been integrated into everything from simple thermostats to the most complicated fighter jets. Multiple methodologies can be used within these controllers including differential equations, discrete difference equations, and fuzzy logic. Also, they can run on platforms ranging from scaled down versions of consumer operating systems to directly on embedded processors. What 2 ̆ 7 s missing is a low cost framework that links the variety of methodologies used in controllers and the variety of platforms that controllers can run on. My thesis is {{that it is possible to}} create a real-time control systems framework that is portable across platforms, is extensible, and has a low cost. The approach to make the framework <b>multi-platformed</b> and to allow it to use multiple control methodologies was to build a software system with a layered design. This was done so that the platform specific information could be isolated in its own layer, the control methodology information could be isolated in its own layer, and the services provided by the framework could be loosely couple from both of them. To solve the problem of price it was decided to make the project open source, which had the added benefit of allowing students, scientists and even corporations to improve upon the system in the long run. The solution that was implemented is called RTCSF, Real-Time Control Systems Framework. It runs on two different platforms, RTLinux, and a preemptable version of the base Linux 2. 6 kernel. Two control methodologies were also implemented in RTCSF, one uses discrete difference equations, and the other uses fuzzy logic. It reached the goals of being <b>multi-platformed,</b> multi-methodology, and low cost, although it has limitations such as being only soft real-time on the 2. 6 preemptable kernel and when running the fuzzy logic methodologies...|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} utilisation {{of technology}} {{provides a more}} collaborative environment to improve the traditional distance learning. Moreover, it has invigorated {{a new era of}} discussion from a range of participants including online learners, learning sources, and eLearning managers. The Learning Management System (LMS) is defined as a hub for handling the overall learning framework in Distance/eLearning education.

5|$|Insomniac had {{exclusively}} developed {{games for}} the PlayStation console until in 2010 when Insomniac announced its partnership with Electronic Arts via EA Partners to develop a <b>multi-platform</b> game for PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Studios' Xbox 360 console. The company hoped to reach a wider audience, while keeping the rights to its IP and retain full control of its franchises. The company revealed nothing about the game. The company established a new subsidiary called Insomniac Click, which focused on casual games and games for Facebook. Its first game was not set in any of Insomniac's existing franchises. Insomniac again partnered with Electronic Arts, which owned the popular casual game developer Playfish, to help the game to reach a broad audience. Outernauts was announced shortly after; it was released in July 2012 for browsers and mobile platforms.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} engagement actions during the experiences in game advertising, with the aim to investigate the elements that support consumer action in a Virtual Reality (VR) game developed for Oculus Rift. Since VR {{can be understood as}} a potential investment in advertising platform, the proposal of this chapter is to comprehend the experience of engagement with brands inside the game, including aspects about VR gameplay and immersion. For that, the researchers developed a game with different levels of brand integration in a VR environment. In order to measure engagement levels in this experience, the researchers have invited 24 participants to play the game to observe their behaviors. As a result of this study, it is suggested that the VR can be a useful environment to insert advertising for <b>multi-platforms</b> experiences, since it can promote an emotional and cognitive experiences around the brand and not only a simple exposition of the advertising...|$|R
40|$|Screen {{industries}} {{around the}} globe are evolving. While technological change has been slower to take effect upon the Australian film industry than other creative sectors such as music and publishing, all indications suggest that local screen practices are {{in a process of}} fundamental change. Fragmenting audiences, the growth of digital video, distribution and exhibition, the potential for entirely new forms of cultural expression, the proliferation of <b>multi-platforms,</b> and the importance of social networking and viral marketing in promoting products, are challenging traditional approaches to ‘film making’. Moreover, there has been a marked transition in government policy rationales and funding models in recent years, resulting in the most significant overhaul of public finance structures for the film industry in almost 20 years. Film, Cinema, Screen evaluates the Australian film industry’s recent development – particularly in terms of Australian feature film and television series production; it also advocates new approaches to Australian film, and address critical issues around how screen production globally is changing, with implications for local screen industries...|$|R
