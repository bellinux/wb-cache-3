5|$|The city {{industry}} {{is dominated by}} food processing, textile, printing and <b>metal</b> <b>processing.</b> In 2012, it accounted for 30% of the city GDP. Most of the industrial areas are located in Gazi Baba municipality, on the major routes and rail lines to Belgrade and Thessaloniki. Notably, the ArcelorMittal and Makstil steel plants are located there, and also the Skopje Brewery. Other zones are located between Aerodrom and Kisela Voda, along the railway to Greece. These zones comprise Alkaloid Skopje (pharmaceuticals), Rade Končar (electrical supplies), Imperial Tobacco, and Ohis (fertilisers). Two special economic zones also exist, around the airport and the Okta refinery. They have attracted several foreign companies, such as Johnson Controls, Johnson Matthey and Van Hool.|$|E

25|$|In North Lanarkshire the North British Railway was a keen competitor, {{having taken}} over the Monkland Railways. The area {{contained}} the rapidly growing iron production area surrounding Coatbridge, and servicing that industry with coal and iron ore, and transport to local and more distant <b>metal</b> <b>processing</b> locations, dominated the Caledonian's activity in the region. The Rutherglen and Coatbridge line, later linking Airdie, and the Carfin to Midcalder line were routes with significant passenger traffic. Many lines to coal and iron ore pits further east were built, but serving remote areas the lines closed when the mineral extraction ceased.|$|E
25|$|Pforzheim University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule Pforzheim – Hochschule fuer Gestaltung, Technik und Wirtschaft) enrolls about 5400 students. It {{was formed}} in 1992 by way of merging the former Pforzheim School of Design (Fachhochschule fuer Gestaltung) and Pforzheim Business School (Fachhochschule fuer Wirtschaft) and {{additionally}} establishing the Faculty of Engineering. The Pforzheim School of Design had {{its roots in the}} Ducal Academy of Arts and Crafts and Technical School for the <b>Metal</b> <b>Processing</b> Industry, established 1877. The Pforzheim Business School was the successor institution of the National Business College, which was established in 1963. The campuses of the Faculty of Design and the Faculties of Economics and Engineering are located at separate sites in the city area. The Pforzheim University of Applied Sciences fosters international exchange. Among other relationships, it is affiliated with the NIEBES Association and has close academic ties to Osijek University of Croatia and academic exchange programs with many institutions abroad, among them Auburn University, the University of Wyoming, Brigham Young University and the Illinois Institute of Technology, in Chicago, of the United States of America.|$|E

The goal of MPLUS {{is to provide}} access to the specialized technical expertise and equipment needed to solve <b>metals</b> <b>processing</b> issues that limit {{the development and implementation of}} emerging <b>metals</b> <b>processing</b> technologies. The scope of work can also extend to other types of materials. MPLUS has four primary User Centers including: (1) Processing [...] casting, powder metallurgy, deformation processing including (extrusion, forging, rolling), melting, thermomechanical processing, high density infrared processing; (2) Joining [...] welding, monitoring and control, solidification, brazing, bonding; (3) Characterization [...] corrosion, mechanical properties, fracture mechanics, microstructure, nondestructive examination, computer-controlled dilatometry, and emissivity; (4) Materials/Process Modeling [...] mathematical design and analyses, high performance computing, process modeling, solidification/deformation, microstructure evolution, thermodynamic and kinetic, and materials data bases. A fully integrated approach provides researchers with unique opportunities to address technologically related issues to solve <b>metals</b> <b>processing</b> problems and probe new technologies. Access is also available to 16 additional Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) user facilities ranging from state of the art materials characterization capabilities, high performance computing, to manufacturing technologies. MPLUS can be accessed through a standardized User-submitted Proposal and a User Agreement. Nonproprietary (open) or proprietary proposals can be submitted. For open research and development, access to capabilities is provides free of charge while for proprietary efforts, the user pays the entire project costs based on DOE guidelines for ORNL costs...|$|R
