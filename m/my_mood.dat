500|$|As the war intensified, the Achebe {{family was}} forced to leave Enugu for the Biafran capital of Aba. As the turmoil closed in, he {{continued}} to write, but most of his creative work during the war took the form of poetry. The shorter format was a consequence of living in a war zone. [...] "I can write poetry," [...] he said, [...] "something short, intense more in keeping with <b>my</b> <b>mood...</b> All this is creating in the context of our struggle." [...] Many of these poems were collected in his 1971 book Beware, Soul Brother. One of his most famous, [...] "Refugee Mother and Child", spoke to the suffering and loss that surrounded him. Dedicated to the promise of Biafra, he accepted a request to serve as foreign ambassador, refusing an invitation from the Program of African Studies at Northwestern University in the US. Achebe traveled to many cities in Europe, including London, where he continued his work with the African Writers Series project at Heinemann.|$|E
500|$|Six {{months later}} he was in back in Ireland, and in August Olivia was visiting Valentine Fox with her husband where she {{received}} news of her father's death. She left for an extended stay in Torquay where she stayed until September before leaving for a visit to Scotland with her husband. Yeats left Ireland for Paris to visit Maud in November, and {{did not return to}} London until January 1897, with Maud following close behind and arriving in London in February. Yeats wrote of Maud's visit: [...] "Maud wrote to me... she was in London & would I come to dine. I dined with her & my trouble increased—she certainly had no thought of the mischief she was doing– & at last one morning.... found <b>my</b> <b>mood</b> did not answer hers and & burst into tears—'There is someone else in your heart' she said. It was the breaking between us for many years". The affair ended that spring when Yeats again returned to Ireland. Olivia did not visit him again at Woburn Place for many years, according to Yeats biographer Richard Ellmann.|$|E
2500|$|In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese recalls that, [...] "I {{left that}} room feeling hurt and humiliated. I did {{something}} I virtually never do, as I said much earlier: I {{went out and}} got drunk. Outside in the Dunedin night the rain was trickling down the windows and the wind was blowing. It was cold and horrible, which exactly reflected <b>my</b> <b>mood.</b> The drops of rain on the windows could have been tears in my soul." ...|$|E

2500|$|In her Kylie / Fashion book, {{illustrating}} her fashion from 1987 as a 25-year recognition, {{said that}} the photoshoot was about sending the message across. She stated [...] "The shoot was incredible. It was my first album with Parlophone {{and we were very}} sure of the message we wanted to get across: sunshine, beach, fun, glamour. I've always loved Ibiza and it's true that the island has a magical quality. The lightness of the chiffon matched <b>my</b> <b>mood</b> and desire." [...] Baker, who helped through the album process, {{said that the}} images have a [...] "mystical quality to them." [...] He then said [...] "With 'Light Years', we wanted a cover that was a visual statement about Kylie reclaiming the throne of the Princess of Pop. Ibiza was perfect [...] And so, surrounded by the infinity of blue sky and ocean, Kylie returned to her rightful place!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Felix responded on 27 November 1916: [...] "Your {{presence}} by {{the middle}} of December is essential. The plan I'm writing you about has been worked out in detail and is three quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone." [...] A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: [...] "I know that if I come, I shall certainly get sick... You don't know how things are with me. I want to cry all the time. <b>My</b> <b>mood</b> is terrible. I've never had one like it before... I don't know myself what's happening to me. Don't drag me to Petrograd. Come down here instead. Forgive me, my dear one, for writing such things to you. But I can't go on any more, I don't know what's the matter with me. Neurasthenia, I think. Don't be angry with me, please don't be angry. I love you terribly. I can't live without you. May the Lord protect you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani {{described}} the album {{as having a}} [...] "more experimental direction". With The Face magazine, Madonna explained her inspirations behind the songs and the music of Music. She said, [...] "This record, {{more than any other}} records, covers all the areas of my life. I left off partying on Ray of Light. But I'd just had a baby, so <b>my</b> <b>mood</b> was complete, like wonderment of life, and I was incredibly thoughtful and retrospective and intrigued by the mystical aspects of life." [...] Madonna also summed it up as [...] "Funky, electronic music blended with futuristic folk. Lots of jangly guitars and moody melancholic lines." [...] "Music", the title track is the first featured on the record. Starting with Madonna's androgynous voice saying [...] "Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on, I wanna dance with my baby". Above this lyric, Madonna's voice electronically manipulated asks [...] "Do you like to boogie woogie?". According to Santiago Fouz-Hernández in his book Madonna's Drowned Worlds: New Approaches to Her Cultural Transformations, [...] "Music" [...] is a 'disco anthem, and the beat commands [...] to get up and dance'. He also said that the song is an expression to her public and it is one of Madonna's catchiest singles of her career. The second track [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] is a club-savvy stomper marked by futuristic keyboard lines and vocals that darken from distorted, and robotic passages. Madonna claimed that the song was the hardest to write. Madonna sings, [...] "I like to singy, singy, singy, like a bird on a wingy, wingy, wingy", with childlike abandon amid a vibrant, celebratory swirl of electronic keyboard riffs and thumpy dance beats.|$|E

60|$|I {{will go on}} to town--I don't want to {{come back}} to Breadalby for the present. But it is quite all right--I don't want you to mind having biffed me, in the least. Tell the others it is just one of <b>my</b> <b>moods.</b> You were quite right, to biff me--because I know you wanted to. So there's the end of it.|$|R

The only thing it does is help keep people off my back because they figure I'm on medication." ...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} from 1964 he said: [...] "I start with my material and my color. With that I express myself. From the material I {{come to my}} subject and that is maybe contrary to what painters did in earlier days. I paint the way I write, the way I laugh. That is why I paint differently all the time, because <b>my</b> <b>moods</b> change. That’s the way I feel." ...|$|R

60|$|Burton, {{though a}} year or two older than I, proved an invincible explorer, tireless, uncomplaining and imperturbable. In all our harsh experiences, {{throughout}} all our eighty days of struggle with mud, rocks, insects, rain, hunger and cold, he never for one moment lost his courage. Kind to our beasts, defiant of the weather, undismayed by any hardship, he kept the trail. He never once lifted his voice in anger. His endurance of <b>my</b> <b>moods</b> was heroic.|$|R
60|$|The spring laziness {{is already}} upon me--insomuch {{that the spirit}} begins to move me to cease from Mississippi {{articles}} and everything else and give myself over to idleness until we go to New Orleans.

I hope {{to get in a}} mood and rattle off a good one to finish with--but just now all <b>my</b> <b>moods</b> are lazy ones.|$|R

5000|$|Psychologically {{those were}} {{difficult}} days for Chekhov, who {{was suffering from}} anxiety and insomnia. [...] "I would have eagerly flee to you in Petersburg, such are <b>my</b> <b>moods,</b> by cholera rages, twenty verstas from here," [...] he wrote Suvorin on 28 July 1983, complaining about [...] "deadly longing for some loneliness" [...] and [...] "horrid psychopathic moods." [...] "...I dont think that I suffer from some psychological ailment. Its just that the will to live seems to have left me, although I dont think its any kind of sickness, perhaps something transitory and trivial," [...] he wrote to Suvorin in January 1894.|$|R
6000|$|<b>My</b> dark <b>mood</b> was deepened into {{bitterness}} by my father's farm, where I {{found my}} mother imprisoned {{in a small}} cabin on the enormous sunburned, treeless plain, with no expectation of ever living anywhere else. Deserted by her sons and failing in health, she endured the discomforts of her life uncomplainingly-but my resentment of [...] "things as they are" [...] deepened during my talks with her neighbors, who were all housed in the same unshaded cabins in equal poverty and loneliness. The fact that at twenty-seven I was without power to aid my mother in any substantial way added to <b>my</b> despairing <b>mood.</b>|$|R
