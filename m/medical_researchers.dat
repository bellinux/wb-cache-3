5|$|Although {{the venom}} {{of a few}} spider and {{scorpion}} species can be very dangerous to humans, <b>medical</b> <b>researchers</b> are investigating {{the use of these}} venoms for the treatment of disorders ranging from cancer to erectile dysfunction. The medical industry also uses the blood of horseshoe crabs as a test for the presence of contaminant bacteria. Mites can cause allergies in humans, transmit several diseases to humans and their livestock, and are serious agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{scientific}} study of yoga began with the works of N. C. Paul and Major D. Basu in the late 19th century, and then continued in the 20th century with Sri Yogendra (1897–1989) and Swami Kuvalayananda. Western <b>medical</b> <b>researchers</b> came to Swami Kuvalayananda's Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center, starting in 1928, to study Yoga as a science.|$|E
5|$|Research at the Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health brought Carson {{into contact}} with <b>medical</b> <b>researchers</b> {{investigating}} the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance {{was the work of}} National Cancer Institute researcher and environmental cancer section founding director Wilhelm Hueper, who classified many pesticides as carcinogens. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide carcinogenesis.|$|E

25|$|Several {{cases of}} tanning {{addiction}} {{have been reported}} by <b>medical</b> <b>researchers.</b> Though the mechanism by which tanning addiction occurs is unknown, some evidence indicates that the release of endorphins during the tanning process causes the pleasurable effects that underlie the addiction.|$|E

25|$|It {{was there}} that <b>medical</b> <b>researchers</b> first {{attributed}} Édouard’s abnormal size to a tumour in his pituitary gland.

25|$|The {{practice}} of naming Afro-Brazilians with religious surnames was proved even by some indirect approaches. <b>Medical</b> <b>researchers</b> demonstrated {{that there is}} a statistical correlation between a religious name and genetic diseases related to African ancestry such as the sickle-cell disease. Due to miscegenation, the correlation exists even among white people that have religious surnames.|$|E
