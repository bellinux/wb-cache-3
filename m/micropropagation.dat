5|$|<b>Micropropagation</b> {{techniques}} including tissue culture.|$|E
5|$|Three main {{methods are}} used for {{propagating}} Hippeastrum: seeds, bulbils and 'twin scales'. More recently <b>micropropagation</b> in vitro has been used on a commercial scale.|$|E
25|$|<b>Micropropagation,</b> {{also known}} as tissue culture, is the {{practice}} of rapidly multiplying stock plant material to produce {{a large number of}} progeny plants. <b>Micropropagation</b> uses in vitro division of small pieces in a sterile environment, where they first produce proliferations of tissue, which are then separated into small pieces that are treated differently so that they produce roots and new stem tissue. The steps in the process are regulated by different ratios of plant growth regulators. Many commercial organizations have produced cannas this way, and specifically the “Island Series” of cannas was introduced by means of mass-produced plants using this technique. However, cannas have a reputation for being difficult <b>micropropagation</b> candidates.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{plant hormones}} or PGRs are {{commonly}} used {{in a number of}} different techniques involving plant propagation from cuttings, grafting, <b>micropropagation,</b> and tissue culture.|$|E
25|$|<b>Micropropagation</b> {{techniques}} {{can be employed}} to disinfest plants of a virus. In the growing tip of a plant, cell division is so rapid that the younger cells {{may not have had}} time to be infected with the virus. The rapidly growing region of meristem cells producing the shoot tip is cut off and placed in vitro, with a very high probability of being uncontaminated by virus.|$|E
25|$|Green {{biotechnology}} is biotechnology {{applied to}} agricultural processes. An {{example would be}} the selection and domestication of plants via <b>micropropagation.</b> Another example is the designing of transgenic plants to grow under specific environments in the presence (or absence) of chemicals. One hope is that green biotechnology might produce more environmentally friendly solutions than traditional industrial agriculture. An {{example of this is}} the engineering of a plant to express a pesticide, thereby ending the need of external application of pesticides. An example of this would be Bt corn. Whether or not green biotechnology products such as this are ultimately more environmentally friendly is a topic of considerable debate.|$|E
500|$|The commonest form of {{commercial}} propagation is by twin-scaling, {{in which the}} bulbs are cut into many small pieces but with two scales still connected by a small fragment of the basal plate. The fragments are disinfected and placed on nutrient media. Some 25–35 new plants can be produced from a single bulb after four years. <b>Micropropagation</b> methods are not used for commercial production but is used for establishing commercial stock.|$|E
500|$|Particularly {{since the}} mid-1960s {{there have been}} {{advances}} in understanding of the physics of plant physiological processes such as transpiration (the transport of water within plant tissues), [...] the temperature dependence of rates of water evaporation from the leaf surface and the molecular diffusion of water vapour and carbon dioxide through stomatal apertures. These developments, coupled with new methods for measuring the size of stomatal apertures, {{and the rate of}} photosynthesis have enabled precise description of the rates of gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere. Innovations in statistical analysis by Ronald Fisher, Frank Yates and others at Rothamsted Experimental Station facilitated rational experimental design and data analysis in botanical research. The discovery and identification of the auxin plant hormones by Kenneth V. Thimann in 1948 enabled regulation of plant growth by externally applied chemicals. Frederick Campion Steward pioneered techniques of <b>micropropagation</b> and plant tissue culture controlled by plant hormones. The synthetic auxin 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or 2,4-D {{was one of the first}} commercial synthetic herbicides.|$|E
2500|$|The {{propagation}} of plants by cuttings of fully developed leaves, stems, or roots is performed by gardeners utilizing auxin as a rooting compound {{applied to the}} cut surface; the auxins are taken into the plant and promote root initiation. In grafting, auxin promotes callus tissue formation, which joins the surfaces of the graft together. In <b>micropropagation,</b> different PGRs are used to promote multiplication and then rooting of new plantlets. [...] In the tissue-culturing of plant cells, PGRs are used to produce callus growth, multiplication, and rooting.|$|E
2500|$|Elm {{propagation}} methods {{vary according}} to elm type and location, and the plantsman's needs. Native species may be propagated by seed. In their natural setting native species, such as wych elm and European White Elm in central and northern Europe and Field Elm in southern Europe, set viable seed in ‘favourable' seasons. Optimal conditions occur after a late warm spring. After pollination, seeds of spring-flowering elms ripen and fall {{at the start of}} summer (June); they remain viable for only a few days. They are planted in sandy potting-soil at a depth of one centimetre, and germinate in three weeks. Slow-germinating American Elm will remain dormant until the second season. Seeds from autumn-flowering elms ripen in the Fall and germinate in the spring. Since elms may hybridize within and between species, seed-propagation entails a hybridisation risk. In unfavourable seasons elm seeds are usually sterile. Elms outside their natural range, such as Ulmus procera in England, and elms unable to pollinate because pollen-sources are genetically identical, are sterile and are propagated by vegetative reproduction. Vegetative reproduction is also used to produce genetically identical elms (clones). Methods include the winter transplanting of root-suckers; taking hardwood cuttings from vigorous one-year-old shoots in late winter, taking root-cuttings in early spring; taking softwood cuttings in early summer; grafting; ground and air layering; and <b>micropropagation.</b> A bottom heat of 18 degrees and humid conditions are maintained for hard- and softwood cuttings. The transplanting of root-suckers remains the easiest and commonest propagation-method for European Field Elm and its hybrids. For 'specimen' urban elms, grafting to wych-elm root-stock may be used to eliminate suckering or to ensure stronger root-growth. The mutant-elm cultivars are usually grafted, the ‘weeping' elms 'Camperdown' and 'Horizontalis' at , the dwarf cultivars 'Nana' and 'Jacqueline Hillier' at ground level. Since the Siberian Elm is drought-tolerant, in dry countries new varieties of elm are often root-grafted on this species.|$|E
50|$|Most Sansevieria species seldom set seed, and {{commercial}} {{species such as}} Sansevieria trifasciata are typically grown using <b>micropropagation.</b> However, since S. pinguicula grows so slowly, <b>micropropagation</b> is unprofitable. Therefore, vegetative propagation by division or by leaf cutting is the preferred method.|$|E

50|$|In {{plant tissue}} culture IBA and other auxins are used to {{initiate}} root formation in vitro in a procedure called <b>micropropagation.</b> <b>Micropropagation</b> of plants {{is the process of}} using small samples of plants called explants and causing them to undergo growth of differentiated or undifferentiated cells. In connection with cytokinins like kinetin, auxins like IBA can be used to cause the formation of masses of undifferentiated cells called callus. Callus formation is often used as a first step process in <b>micropropagation</b> where the callus cells are then caused to form other tissues such as roots by exposing them to certain hormones like auxins that produce roots. The process of callus to root formation is called indirect organogenesis whereas if roots are formed from the explant directly it is called direct organogenesis.|$|E
50|$|Callus is of {{particular}} use in <b>micropropagation</b> {{where it can be}} used to grow genetically identical copies of plants with desirable characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The major {{limitation}} {{in the use}} of <b>micropropagation</b> {{for many}} plants is the cost of production; for many plants the use of seeds, which are normally disease free and produced in good numbers, readily produce plants (see orthodox seed) in good numbers at a lower cost. For this reason, many plant breeders do not utilize <b>micropropagation</b> because the cost is prohibitive. Other breeders use it to produce stock plants that are then used for seed multiplication.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Micropropagation</b> often {{produces}} more robust plants, leading to accelerated growth compared to similar plants produced by conventional methods - like seeds or cuttings.|$|E
