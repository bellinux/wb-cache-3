40|$|We {{show that}} {{alloying}} with {{rare earth metals}} (REMs) can dramatically improve the <b>machineability</b> {{of a range of}} titanium alloys, even though the REM is not incorporated in the alloy matrix. The mechanism for this is that under cutting, shear bands are formed within which the nano-precipitates of REM are shear mixed. This lowers the melting point such that the mechanism of deformation changes from dislocation mechanism to localised amorphisation and shear softening. The material then fractures along the thin, amorphous shear-band. Outside the shear band, the REM remains as precipitates. The new alloys have similar mechanical properties and biocompatibility to conventional materials. Comment: MRS Conference proceedings Phoenix 201...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 The {{interaction}} between abrasive waterjet (AWJ) and brittle materials, {{as well as}} lated machining mechanisms, was studied using a hybrid experimental - numerical analysis approach. First, the <b>machineability</b> of ceramic materials, such as alumina, silicon nitride, silicon carbide, and titanium diboride, was studied by varying the AWJ input parameters. The AWJ machining forces on these materials were measured and discussed. First, an SEM {{study was conducted to}} investigate the AWJ machining mechanisms on continuous fiber-reinforced ceramic composites (CFCC). Second, a moire interferometry experimental setup and procedure were developed, as well as a 3 -D finite element model. The measured surface displacement distributions were used to drive the finite element modeling. In this inverse problem, the measured reaction forces of the specimen during AWJ drilling were matched the reaction forces from the finite element simulation. Three pressure loads of the AWJ exerted on the cavity were assumed for the FEA model, and their effects on the surface displacement distribution were studied through numerical experiments. The verification of the finite element model was carried out by studying a statically loaded specimen, both experimentally and numerically, in which the moire fringe patterns from the experiments and the displacement contour plots from the FEA were compared. The test results from the <b>machineability</b> study indicated that structural ceramics can be machined by AWJ at a reasonable material removal rate. Under certain conditions a threshold supply pressure exists. The impact force on a specimen by pure waterjet is about 20...|$|E
40|$|Packaging {{materials}} with paper are often susceptible to rupture when pulled over the forming shoulder of vertical pouch form-, fill- and seal-machines. The {{reason is that}} the arising web tensions are too high in relation to the tensile strength of the laminated packaging materials. Tests on a form-, fill- and seal-machine of the Transwrap 125 H type showed that manipulations at the paper surface with the aim to reduce the dynamic friction coefficient are not so efficient. In this case the bending stiffness has to be regarded as the considerable criterion for the <b>machineability.</b> Therefore, as far as the machine is concerned, variations of the feeding angle at the forming shoulder promise the best possible results...|$|E

40|$|A machineable mica based {{glass-ceramic}} for dental application {{has been}} developed. The main crystalline {{phase of the}} product is a Na-fluorophlogopite mica. The effect of ZrO 2 addition on nucleation and crystallization was studied and the resulting microstructure was compared with the mechanical properties. No effective nucleation process {{was found in the}} zirconia-free composition. A constant number of crystals was found independent of the crystallization conditions. Therefore it is assumed that nuclei are quenched in during the preparation of the glass. A linear growth law for the mica crystals was found. Pseudodendritic growth forms seem to be the consequence of lattice defects. In contrast, the nucleation process of the ZrO 2 -containing glass is sensible to variations in composition and nucleation temperature. An optimized nucleation leads to a fine-grained mica structure after crystallization at 900 °C.

40|$|Selection {{of process}} {{parameters}} has very {{significant impact on}} product quality, production costs and production times. The quality and cost are much related to tool life, surface roughness and cutting forces which they are functions of process parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut and tool nose radius). In this paper, empirical models for tool life, surface roughness and cutting force are developed for turning operations. The process parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut and tool nose radius) are used as inputs to the developed <b>machineability</b> models. Two data mining techniques are used; response surface methodology and neural networks. The data of 28 experiments {{have been used to}} generate, compare and evaluate the proposed models of tool life, cutting force and surface roughness for the selected tool/material combination. The resulting models are utilized to formulate an optimization model and solved to find optimal process parameters, when the objective is minimizing production cost per workpiece, taking into account the related boundaries and limitation of this multi-pass turning operations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a process to develop a multi-material {{paperboard}} based laminate carton and membrane. This includes replacing the existing paperboard-polyethylene-foilpolyethylene structure used in the Foldcan. The new structure must meet the current barrier requirement without contaminating the pulp and finished paperboard. Standard requirements of repulpablility for recycled paperboard mills must aslo be met. Research has been conducted to identify all current materials. Potential replacement material for traditional, commonly laminated materials as well as newly developed materials have been studied. A possible new paperboard based lamination which could be easily separated and recycled by all recycled paperboard mills may be successful!. The research concluded that two development paths would be followed. The first path using a material made of flexible glass. This new material is the best candidate for barrier materials but will not be commercially available in the U. S. A. until 1 994. The second path using a material made with metallization. This structure will prove other aspects of a lamination including bond, sealability and <b>machineability.</b> Ultimately the metilization will be replaced with flexible glass.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} the material and energy flow through the abrasive waterjet machine and the WARD recycling machine. The goal was to track all of the material, water, abrasive, energy, air, and tooling through the different components of the machining and recycling processes. The material removal was found to be a function of length and part geometry, while all of the other variables were simply a function of time. The cutting speed determines the abrasive use, water use, and power use, and is varied based on the material, geometry, thickness and cut quality. The cutting speed was found to be linear with <b>machineability</b> [...] a measure of the material, almost linear with hardness [...] inversely related to thickness, somewhat inversely related to quality, and linear with power. Water was found to be the most abundant consumable, following by abrasive, together making up over 99 % of the output waste. In the recycling process, roughly 60 % of abrasive can be recycled after a single use, with the only significant consumable being power, used to dry the moist abrasive. Replacement tooling on both the abrasive waterjet and the WARD recycling unit were found to be negligible compared to the large amount of abrasive sludge produced every minute. by Michael Omar Kurd.

The main objective of this project is to examine the progress of tool wear, identify the interaction between the different parameters and to find out the optimal parameter {{that can be used in}} dry machining. In this project, 33 full factorial design of experiments (DOE) was employed in STATISTICA software to plan and perform the experiment systematically so that any possible experimental error would be minimized. Machining variables considered are cutting length, cutting speed and feed rate. The variables for there levels were 90, 120 and 150 rev/min for cutting speed, 0. 13, 0. 18, 0. 22 mm/rev for the feed rate and 0. 8, 1. 0, and 1. 2 mm for depth of cut respectively. Machining AISI 1065 was carried out by using the conventional lathe machine. The work piece is been turning for 7 rounds for each turning process.

Experimental data was analyzed in STATISTICA. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is done to identify the most influencing parameters in this research. From the ANOVA analysis, the cutting speed and the feed rate are the most significant parameter that influencing tool wear. Depth of cut effect can be negligible.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the wear of coated carbide insert in {{machining}} of mild steel. <b>Machineability</b> of mild steel is considered good although the cutting temperature is high. The characteristic of mild steel like high strength, high resistance to breakage and high modulus of elasticity has increased the tool wear of the coated carbide when {{it is used to}} machining the mild steel for long period. As a result, tool wear of the coated carbide inserts in machining of mild steel still need to be improved. The main objective of this project is to examine the progress of tool wear and determine the crater wear and flank wear of the tool in machining the mild steel in turning process. In this project, 33 full factorial design of experiments (DOE) was employed in STATISTICA software to plan and perform the experiment systematically so that any possible experimental error would be minimized. Machining variables considered are cutting length, cutting speed and feed rate. The variables for three levels were 90, 120 and 150 m/min for cutting speed, 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 15 mm/rev for feed rate and 60, 120 and 180 mm for cutting length respectively. Machining of mild steel was carried out by using the conventional lathe machine. After each experiment, flank and crater wear of the coated carbide inserts was investigated and measured by using optical microscope integrated with Image Analyzer. Experimental data was analyzed in STATISTICA. Flank and crater wear curves were then plotted using Minitab software. The result indicates that feed rate is the most significant parameter that influencing both the flank and crater wear compared to cutting speed and cutting length. Optical micrograph of tool wear shows the crater wear progressed faster than flank wear. Tool wear curves shows that when the number of experiments increases, the flank and crater wear increase monotonically...|$|E
40|$|Magnesium alloys {{have been}} of growing {{interest}} to various engineering applications, such as the automobile, aerospace, communication and computer industries due to their low density, high specific strength, good <b>machineability</b> and availability as compared with other structural materials. However, most Mg alloys suffer from poor plasticity due to their Hexagonal Close Packed structure. Grain refinement has been {{proved to be an}} effective method to enhance the strength and alter the ductility of the materials. Several methods have been proposed to produce materials with nanocrystalline grain structures. So far, most of the research work on nanocrystalline materials has been carried out on Face-Centered Cubic and Body-Centered Cubic metals. However, there has been little investigation of nanocrystalline Mg alloys. In this study, bulk coarse-grained and nanocrystalline Mg alloys were fabricated by a mechanical alloying method. The mixed powder of Mg chips and Al powder was mechanically milled under argon atmosphere for different durations of 0 hours (MA 0), 10 hours (MA 10), 20 hours (MA 20), 30 hours (MA 30) and 40 hours (MA 40), followed by compaction and sintering. Then the sintered billets were hot-extruded into metallic rods with a 7 mm diameter. The obtained Mg alloys have a nominal composition of Mg– 5 wt% Al, with grain sizes ranging from 13 μm down to 50 nm, depending on the milling durations. The microstructure characterization and evolution after deformation were carried out by means of Optical microscopy, X-Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Scanning Probe Microscopy and Neutron Diffraction techniques. Nanoindentaion, compression and micro-compression tests on micro-pillars were used to study the size effects on the mechanical behaviour of the Mg alloys. Two kinds of size effects on the mechanical behaviours and deformation mechanisms were investigated: grain size effect and sample size effect. The nanoindentation tests were composed of constant strain rate, constant loading rate and indentation creep tests. The normally reported indentation size effect in single crystal and coarse-grained crystals was observed in both the coarse-grained and nanocrystalline Mg alloys. Since the indentation size effect is correlated to the Geometrically Necessary Dislocations under the indenter to accommodate the plastic deformation, the good agreement between the experimental results and the Indentation Size Effect model indicated that, in the current nanocrystalline MA 20 and MA 30, the dislocation plasticity was still the dominant deformation mechanism. Significant hardness enhancement with decreasing grain size, down to 58 nm, was found in the nanocrystalline Mg alloys. Further reduction of grain size would lead to a drop in the hardness values. The failure of grain refinement strengthening with the relatively high strain rate sensitivity of nanocrystalline Mg alloys suggested a change in the deformation mechanism. Indentation creep tests showed that the stress exponent was dependent on the loading rate during the loading section of the indentation, which was related to the dislocation structures before the creep starts. The influence of grain size on the mechanical behaviour and strength of extruded coarse-grained and nanocrystalline Mg alloys were investigated using uniaxial compression tests. The macroscopic response of the Mg alloys transited from strain hardening to strain softening behaviour, with grain size reduced from 13 ìm to 50 nm. The strain hardening was related to the twinning induced hardening and dislocation hardening effect, while the strain softening was attributed to the localized deformation in the nanocrystalline grains. The tension–compression yield asymmetry was noticed in the nanocrystalline region, demonstrating the twinning effect in the ultra-fine-grained and nanocrystalline region. The relationship k tensions < k compression failed in the nanocrystalline Mg alloys; this was attributed to the twofold effect of grain size on twinning. The nanocrystalline Mg alloys were found to exhibit increased strain rate sensitivity with decreasing grain size, with strain rate ranging from 0. 0001 /s to 0. 01 /s. Strain rate sensitivity of coarse-grained MA 0 was increased by more than 10 times in MA 40. The Hall-Petch relationship broke down at a critical grain size in the nanocrystalline region. The breakdown of the Hall-Petch relationship and the increased strain rate sensitivity were due to the localized dislocation activities (generalization and annihilation at grain boundaries) and the more significant contribution from grain boundary mediated mechanisms. In the micro-compression tests, the sample size effects on the mechanical behaviours were studied on MA 0, MA 20 and MA 40 micro-pillars. In contrast to the bulk samples under compression, the stress-strain curves of MA 0 and MA 20 micro-pillars were characterized with a number of discrete strain burst events separated by nearly elastic strain segments. Unlike MA 0 and MA 20, the stress-strain curves of MA 40 micro-pillars were smooth, without obvious strain bursts. The deformation mechanisms of the MA 0 and MA 20 micro-pillars under micro-compression tests were considered to be initially dominated by deformation twinning, followed by dislocation mechanisms. For MA 40 pillars, the deformation mechanisms were believed to be localized dislocation activities and grain boundary related mechanisms. The strain hardening behaviours of the micro-pillars suggested that the grain boundaries in the nanocrystalline micro-pillars would reduce the source (nucleation sources for twins/dislocations) starvation hardening effect. The power law relationship of the yield strength on pillar dimensions in MA 0, MA 20 supported the fact that the twinning mechanism was correlated to the pre-existing defects, which can promote the nucleation of the twins. Then, we provided a latitudinal comparison of the results and conclusions derived from the different techniques used for testing the coarse-grained and nanocrystalline Mg alloy; this helps to better understand the deformation mechanisms of the Mg alloys as a whole. At the end, we summarized the thesis and highlighted the conclusions, contributions, innovations and outcomes of the research. Finally, it outlined recommendations for future work...|$|E
