50|$|The {{fact that}} the current is carried by a corona {{discharge}} (and not a tightly-confined arc) means that the moving particles are diffusely spread out into an expanding ion cloud, and collide frequently with neutral air molecules. It is these collisions that create a net movement. The momentum of the ion cloud is partially imparted onto the neutral air molecules that it collides with, which, being neutral, do not eventually migrate back to the second electrode. Instead they continue to travel in the same direction, creating a neutral wind. As these neutral molecules are ejected from the ionocraft, there are, in agreement with Newton's Third Law of Motion, equal and opposite forces, so the ionocraft moves {{in the opposite direction}} with an equal force. There are hundreds of thousands of molecules per second ejected from the device, so the force exerted is comparable to a gentle breeze. Still, this is enough to make a light balsa <b>model</b> <b>lift</b> its own weight. The resulting thrust also depends on other external factors including air pressure and temperature, gas composition, voltage, humidity, and air gap distance.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a low speed wind tunnel test of 0. 046 scale model target thrust reversers {{installed}} on a 727 - 200 model airplane are presented. The full airplane model was mounted on a force balance, except for the nacelles and thrust reversers, which were independently mounted and isolated from it. The installation had the capability of simulating the inlet airflows and of supplying the correct proportions of primary and secondary air to the nozzles. The objectives of the test were to assess the compatibility of the thrust reversers target door design with the engine and airplane. The following measurements were made: hot gas ingestion at the nacelle inlets; <b>model</b> <b>lift,</b> drag, and pitching moment; hot gas impingement on the airplane structure; and qualitative assessment of the rudder effectiveness. The major parameters controlling hot gas ingestion {{were found to be}} thrust reverser orientation, engine power setting, and the lip height of the bottom thrust reverser doors on the side nacelles.

40|$|In recent years, the FAA {{has worked}} with Transport Canada, National Research Council Canada (NRC) and APS Aviation, Inc. to develop {{allowance}} times for aircraft operations in ice-pellet precipitation. These allowance times are critical to ensure safety and efficient operation of commercial and cargo flights. Wind-tunnel testing with uncontaminated anti-icing fluids and fluids contaminated with simulated ice pellets had been carried out at the NRC Propulsion and Icing Wind Tunnel (PIWT) {{to better understand the}} flowoff characteristics and resulting aerodynamic effects. The percent lift loss on the thin, high-performance wing model tested in the PIWT was determined at 8 angle of attack and used as one of the evaluation criteria in determining the allowance times. Because it was unclear as to how performance degradations measured on this model were relevant to an actual airplane configuration, some means of interpreting the wing <b>model</b> <b>lift</b> loss was deemed necessary. This paper describes how the lift loss was related to the loss in maximum lift of a Boeing 737 - 200 ADV airplane through the Aerodynamic Acceptance Test (AAT) performed for fluids qualification. A loss in maximum lift coefficient of 5. 24 percent on the B 737 - 200 ADV airplane (which was adopted as the threshold in the AAT) corresponds to a lift loss of 7. 3 percent on the PIWT model at 8 angle of attack. There is significant scatter in the data used to develop the correlation related to varying effects of the anti-icing fluids that were tested and other factors. A statistical analysis indicated the upper limit of lift loss on the PIWT model was 9. 2 percent. Therefore, for cases resulting in PIWT <b>model</b> <b>lift</b> loss from 7. 3 to 9. 2 percent, extra scrutiny of the visual observations is required in evaluating fluid performance with contamination...|$|E
