5|$|Adjectives <b>modify</b> a noun by {{providing}} {{additional information about}} their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they <b>modify</b> and after determiners. In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, {{and they do not}} agree in form with the noun they <b>modify,</b> as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. We {{develop a}} score test {{statistic}} based on quasi-score functions for {{goodness of fit}} of generalized linear models to sparse data. A <b>modified</b> score test statistic is also obtained. The <b>modified</b> score test statistic has a simple form and {{is closely related to}} the test statistic based on the <b>modified</b> Pearson statistic developed by Farrington (1996). The <b>modified</b> score test statistic is {{greater than or equal to}} the standardized <b>modified</b> Pearson statistic. For Poisson data the <b>modified</b> score test statistic is identical to the standardized <b>modified</b> Pearson statistic. For binomial data the <b>modified</b> score test statistic is, in general, more powerful than the test based on the <b>modified</b> Pearson statistic. The gain in power of the <b>modified</b> Pearson statistic and the <b>modified</b> score statistic over the score statistic may be substantial. 1...|$|R

40|$|Combined the {{nitric acid}} {{oxidation}} method and in-situ polymerization method {{were applied to}} prepare two kinds of electromagnetic <b>modified</b> short carbon fibers (SCF), coated with aniline/magnetic liquid and aniline/magnetic powder.

The complex permittivity and complex permeability of the <b>modified</b> SCF were measured by Agilent PNALN 5230 A microwave network analyzer in 50 MHz- 2 GHz band.

40|$|Three {{kinds of}} <b>modified</b> asphalt were {{prepared}} by adding waste crumb rubber (WCR), waste polyethylene (WPE), and WCR/WPE to base asphalt, respectively. The influence of different doses {{on the performance}} of <b>modified</b> asphalt, such as 25 °C penetration, softening point, 5 °C ductility, and 135 °C, 165 °C viscosity, was studied, and the modification mechanism of <b>modified</b> asphalt was discussed through the fluorescence microscope.
