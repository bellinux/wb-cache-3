5|$|I do {{not know}} what I may appear to the world, but to <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and {{diverting}} myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.|$|E
5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For <b>myself,</b> <b>I</b> must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.|$|E
5|$|C'est trop bête d'en parler (It's {{too stupid}} to talk about). There was a break. Coppi {{attacked}}. His brother Fausto gave him a push to get him away. He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by <b>myself.</b> <b>I</b> {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E

5000|$|... "All <b>I</b> Ask of <b>Myself</b> <b>Is</b> That I Hold Together" [...] was {{the first}} single from Ned's Atomic Dustbin's 1995 album, Brainbloodvolume.|$|R

5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
25|$|On 7 October 2013, Armatrading {{announced}} on her website {{that she would}} be embarking on her last major tour, to be combined with her first solo tour of intimate concerts, featuring just herself playing and singing. She released a CD/DVD album from the tour, entitled Me <b>Myself</b> <b>I</b> World Tour, in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Someone {{from whom}} I feel ever more distant is Juan Gris. I admire him but I cannot {{understand}} why he wears himself out with decomposing objects. <b>Myself,</b> <b>I</b> am advancing towards synthetic unity and I don't analyze any more. I take from things what {{seems to me to}} have meaning and be most suitable to express my thought. I want to be direct, like Voltaire. No more metaphors. Ah those stuffed tomatoes of all the St-Pol-Roux of painting.|$|E
50|$|I {{began to}} ceaselessly examine and confirm my state of mind: myself {{when it went}} well, myself when it went poorly, <b>myself</b> when <b>I</b> was trying to defeat my partner, <b>myself</b> when <b>I</b> was feeling fear, <b>myself</b> when <b>I</b> was feeling insecure, etc. From these confirmations, I learned the {{importance}} of ceaselessly keeping my mind calm.|$|R

25|$|With {{reference}} to rumours which I believe were {{at one time}} afloat, though I know not with what degree of currency: and also with {{reference to}} the times when I shall not be here to answer for <b>myself,</b> <b>I</b> desire to record my solemn declaration and assurance, as in the sight of God and before His Judgement Seat, that at no period of my life have I been guilty of the act which is known as that of infidelity to the marriage bed.|$|E
25|$|I {{have often}} {{sat back and}} thought just how nice {{it would be if}} you could relive your life based on the {{experience}} gained. For <b>myself,</b> <b>I</b> would never again try to achieve the impossible by trying to change things. On the two occasions I have tried to do this , I have failed, not because I lack followers, or because of the opposition of opposing bodies, but because of the activities of anarchists and those who are envious of your success and popularity.|$|E
25|$|I {{was getting}} so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring <b>myself,</b> <b>I</b> was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E

25|$|If I {{knew what}} I know now I {{probably}} would have switched. At the time I had already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for <b>myself.</b> <b>I</b> just persevered with it.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, I {{worked in}} a Jewish school in Dublin, {{teaching}} French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and {{worked in a}} kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was {{going out to the}} Middle East by <b>myself.</b> <b>I</b> wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.|$|E
25|$|My dear friend, {{what is this}} our life? A {{boat that}} swims in the sea, and all one knows for certain {{about it is that}} one day it will capsize. Here we are, two good old boats that have been {{faithful}} neighbors, and above all your hand has done its best to keep me from 'capsizing'! Let us then continue our voyage -- each for the other's sake, for a long time yet, a long time! We should miss each other so much! Tolerably calm seas and good winds and above all sun -- what I wish for <b>myself,</b> <b>I</b> wish for you, too, and am sorry that my gratitude can find expression only in such a wish and has no influence at all on wind or weather.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{know you}} haven't. I ain't blaming you, gentlemen. <b>I</b> brought <b>myself</b> down--yes, <b>I</b> did it <b>myself.</b> It's right <b>I</b> should suffer--perfectly right--I don't make any moan." ...|$|R
6000|$|Besides, if she suffers, I suffer too. In {{the length}} and breadth of England, I doubt {{if there is a}} much more wicked young woman to be found than <b>myself.</b> <b>Is</b> it nothing to feel that, and to endure it as I do? ...|$|R

25|$|For <b>myself,</b> <b>I</b> am now in my 63rd year, yet my {{constitution}} is not seriously impaired, {{as you may}} conclude when I mention that I still am able to skate, to play at cricket occasionally with my sons, and that last year I rowed with them upon the Tay, a distance of eight miles, as stroke of a Four-oar? Nor when I think of others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised. It is true we used to be told, even in those days, that no man in a Racing-Boat could expect to live to the age of thirty.|$|E
25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews. It {{has been argued that}} in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think Hollywood {{is the place to be}} yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found myself to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me and I learned how to be <b>myself....</b> <b>I</b> learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} said {{anything}} about politics today. I don't propose {{to say anything about}} politics. You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing <b>myself.</b> <b>I</b> came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E

25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and I asked for permission to take him out. But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused my request. John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to <b>myself.</b> <b>I</b> told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. Just call Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was too embarrassed even to ask me for help.|$|E
500|$|He talked {{openly in}} the music press about his problems, telling the NME: [...] "When I cut <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> feel so much better. All {{the little things that}} might have been {{annoying}} me seem so trivial because I'm concentrating on the pain", and [...] "I'm {{the sort of person who}} wakes up in the morning and needs to pour a bottle down my throat".|$|E
500|$|As a child, Williams kept {{to herself}} and was self-sufficient; as she has said, [...] "I was really secretive with my parents and I think I sort of {{continued}} that... I found that by keeping to <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> got on OK. I don't know why." [...] When Williams was nine, her family moved to San Diego, California. She became interested in acting {{at an early age}} when she saw a local production of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.|$|E
5000|$|Ned's Atomic Dustbin had {{one last}} UK top 40 single with [...] "All <b>I</b> Ask of <b>Myself</b> <b>Is</b> That I Hold Together" [...] in 1995, {{following}} a final appearance on The Word, while the uncharacteristically slow number, [...] "Stuck", became the band's final single, making the BBC Radio One B-list. In 1995, after an extensive US tour to support Brainbloodvolume, Ned's Atomic Dustbin split up in New York City following {{what would be}} their final show.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>myself,</b> so <b>I</b> am told, {{carry this}} coyness--this {{shrinking}} reticence concerning anything connected {{with my own}} personality, almost too far; and people grumble at me because of it. People {{come to me and}} say - ...|$|R
