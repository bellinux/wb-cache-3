40|$|<b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>biofuels</b> from {{existing}} biomass {{may provide a}} sustainable alternative to the extensive utilization of fossil fuels. Biomass offers environmental advantage over fossil fuels {{as it is a}} renewable energy source with low sulphur and nitrogen content and is carbon neutral over its production and utilization. Ranges of biomass are reported worldwide to be suitable raw material for bioethanol production. These can be generally classified into three groups; sucrose based (sugar cane), starch based (corn, wheat and barley) and lignocellulosic (which is mostly comprised of lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses in grasses, wood and straw) materials. However, the limited supply of two biomass groups (sucrose and starch) will not satisfy society’s growing energy demands; thus biofuel technology based on lignocelluloses is under intense investigation. The main bottleneck in lignocellulosic biomass conversion for biofuel production is the enzymatic depolymerisation of cell wall polysaccharides into fermentable sugars. Protein engineering has recently been used to improve the performance of lignocelluloses degrading enzymes, as well as proteins involved in biofuel synthesis pathways. We have produced a recombinant enzyme that has the ability to produce monomeric sugars from a complex substrate.

40|$|Lignocellulosic {{biomass is a}} {{renewable}} raw material, {{widespread and}} {{with a huge potential}} for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>biofuels</b> as bioethanol. In Portugal, the most abundant exploitable lignocellulosic biomass derives from the agro-industrial and forestry sectors. Large amounts of residues are generated during wine processing, specially pruning residues of vine. Approximately 1. 2 - 3. 5 t/ha of vine pruning residues (VPR) are estimated to be produced per year, which are usually burnt in the field. VPR are composed by 30. 6 % of cellulose, 18. 2 % of hemicellulose and 29. 5 % of lignin. In order to produce ethanol from this agro-industrial residue, autohydrolysis treatment in two sequential steps were proposed for solubilization of hemicellulose in a separate stream and improving the enzymatic susceptibility of cellulose following the biorefinery concept. In a first stage, VPR was submitted to autohydrolysis treatment at 180 ºC for 60 min (Severity factor, So= 4. 13) at liquid to solid ratio = 6 g of distilled water/g of VPR. In liquid phase, 55 g of xylan/ 100 g of xylan in raw material was recovered as xylooligosaccharides (13 g/L). Autohydrolyzed VPR was evaluated in a second step of autohydrolysis treatment under temperature in the range 180 - 200 ºC and time 30 - 40 min. After sequential treatments, 90 - 99 % of cellulose was recovered in solid phase and enzymatic saccharification of pretreated solid was assayed using 25 FPU/g of cellulase CTec 2 and solid loading of 5 and 10 % of pretreated VPR. Sequential treatment of VPR significantly improved the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose from 70 % to 100 % of cellulose to glucose conversion for second autohydrolysis at 200 ºC for 30 min. Under these conditions of pretreatment, two configurations of saccharification and fermentation (simultaneously –SSF- and separately –SHF-) were carried out. Ethanol production was successfully obtained from two processes achieving cellulose to ethanol conversion of 93 and 97 % for SHF and SSF, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{continued}} {{depletion of}} oil reserves, {{a necessity for}} energy security and the environmental importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions has prompted the industrial development of clean, non-conventional, renewable fuels. Transport fuels are currently composed primarily of fossil-derived alkanes and commonly contain a minor <b>biofuel</b> component <b>of</b> bioethanol in gasoline or fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) in diesel. Increasing biofuel supply to satisfy governmental targets imposes substantial technological constraints on automobile engine manufacturers and raises controversies over arable land usage. ‘Drop-in’, microbial, alkane biofuels are structurally identical to fossil fuels and their production does not compete directly with arable farming, thereby obviating {{the problems associated with}} the <b>manufacture</b> and deployment <b>of</b> bioethanol and FAMEs. This study investigated alkane biosynthesis in two non-photosynthetic bacteria, Mycobacterium sp. NCIMB 10403 and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, to evaluate their potential for use as biocatalysts in the industrial <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> ‘drop-in’ <b>biofuels.</b> This study employed single- and two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as a means to provide a rigorous analysis of alkane biosynthesis in these bacteria. In addition, a microarray analysis was used to develop an understanding of the genes potentially important in regulating alkane production in D. desulfuricans. In contrast to the original reports from the 1960 ’s, Mycobacterium sp. NCIMB 10403 and D. desulfuricans NCIMB 8307 did not synthesise alkanes. Alkane biosynthesis was confirmed in D. desulfuricans NCIMB 8326 although the alkane quantities and carbon chain length distribution differed significantly to those previously reported. The microarray data gave evidence to suggest that the expression of genes encoding a long chain fatty acid-CoA ligase and an aspartyl/glutamyl-tRNA amidotransferase may be important for regulating alkane biosynthesis in D. desulfuricans. Furthermore, several genes encoding hypothetical proteins were identified as being potentially involved directly in the formation of alkanes.

40|$|Modern {{energy policy}} aims to ratchet up the <b>manufacture</b> and use <b>of</b> <b>biofuels,</b> i. e. any fuel {{produced}} from biological materials. Yet biofuels derived from agricultural crops and residues, wood, forest residues, or {{other kinds of}} plant-based biomass feedstocks can be as environmentally and socially devastating as the finite fossil fuel resources they seek to replace. Often overlooked are their globalization impacts on land grabs, food security, greenhouse gas emissions, drought, deforestation, interference with climate change adaption measures, population displacement, desertification, sea level rise, biodiversity, and scalability. These environmental and social consequences result in food shortages, violent conflicts, urban riots, rural protests, and rising food costs. There is, however, hope for biofuels. Certain other types <b>of</b> <b>biofuels,</b> known collectively as second generation biofuels, are a more suitable alternative for global and regional energy needs because of their availability {{as well as their}} significantly reduced public health, environmental, and climate change impacts on society. These new biofuels are derived from algae, seaweed, food waste, and other plant and animal residues. While these biofuels are a more appropriate replacement for fossil fuels than first generation biofuels, they too carry with them potentially significant impacts. Therefore, a cautionary analysis of regulatory and governance regimes for second generation bio¬¬fuels is critical for improving innovation and investment for this energy resource. To that effect, I provide an inquiry into biofuel law and policy through the theoretical framework of science, technology, society, and the environment (STSE) to assess the hurried development <b>of</b> <b>biofuels</b> and how this biofuel gold rush has had adverse social, economic, and environmental consequences globally.
