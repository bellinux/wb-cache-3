The drag forces exerted on the particles by the relative velocity by {{them and the}} flow were treated as additional forces acting on the particles. Therefore, these <b>multiphase</b> <b>flow</b> phenomena including a solid e.g.~particulate and a gaseous or fluid phase resolve the particulate phase by discrete methods, while gas or liquid flow is described by continuous methods, and therefore, is labelled the combined continuum and discrete model (CCDM) as applied by Kawaguchi et al., Hoomans, Xu 1997 and Xu 1998. [...] Due to a discrete description of the solid phase, constitutive relations are omitted, and therefore, leads {{to a better understanding}} of the fundamentals. This was also concluded by Zhu 2007 et al. and Zhu 2008 et al. during a review on particulate flows modelled with the CCDM approach. It has seen a mayor development in last two decades and describes motion of the solid phase by the Discrete Element Method (DEM) on an individual particle scale and the remaining phases are treated by the Navier-Stokes equations. Thus, the method is recognized as an effective tool to investigate into the interaction between a particulate and fluid phase as reviewed by Yu and Xu, Feng and Yu [...] and Deen et al.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of an inductive flow tomography (IFT) system, employing a multi-electrode electromagnetic flow meter (EMFM) and novel reconstruction techniques, for measuring the local water velocity distribution in water continuous single and <b>multiphase</b> <b>flows.</b> A series of experiments were carried out in vertical-upward and upward-inclined single phase water flows and 'water continuous' gas–water and oil–gas–water flows in which the velocity profiles ranged from axisymmetric (single phase and vertical-upward <b>multiphase</b> <b>flows)</b> to highly asymmetric (upward-inclined <b>multiphase</b> <b>flows).</b> Using potential difference measurements obtained from the electrode array of the EMFM, local axial velocity distributions of the continuous water phase were reconstructed using two different IFT reconstruction algorithms denoted RT# 1, which assumes that the overall water velocity profile comprises the sum {{of a series of}} polynomial velocity components, and RT# 2, which is similar to RT# 1 but which assumes that the zero'th order velocity component may be replaced by an axisymmetric 'power law' velocity distribution. During each experiment, measurement of the local water volume fraction distribution was also made using the well-established technique of electrical resistance tomography (ERT). By integrating the product of the local axial water velocity and the local water volume fraction in the cross section an estimate of the water volumetric flow rate was made which was compared with a reference measurement of the water volumetric flow rate. In vertical upward flows RT# 2 was found to give rise to water velocity profiles which are consistent with the previous literature although the profiles obtained in the <b>multiphase</b> <b>flows</b> had relatively higher central velocity peaks than was observed for the single phase profiles. This observation was almost certainly a result of the transfer of axial momentum from the less dense dispersed phases to the water, which occurred preferentially at the pipe centre. For upward inclined <b>multiphase</b> <b>flows</b> RT# 1 was found to give rise to water velocity profiles which are more consistent with results in the previous literature than was the case for RT# 2 —which leads to the tentative conclusion that the upward inclined <b>multiphase</b> <b>flows</b> investigated in the present study did not contain significant axisymmetric velocity components...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It {{is known}} that {{particle}} size has an influence in determining the erosion rate, and hence equipment life, on a target material in single phase flows (i. e. flow of solid particles in liquid only or gas only flows). In reality this is rarely the case for field applications in {{the oil and gas}} industry. Field cases are typically multiphase in nature, with volumetric combinations of gas, liquid and sand. Erosion predictions of <b>multiphase</b> <b>flows</b> extrapolated from single phase flow results may sometimes be overly conservative or severely under-predict reality. Current understanding of particle size distribution on material erosion in <b>multiphase</b> <b>flows</b> is limited. This work examines the effect of particle size distribution on material erosion of a cylindrical aluminium rod positioned in a 2 " vertical pipe under slug and distributed bubble regimes using various water and air volume ratios.

The particles are allowed to be mixed sizes and are not restricted to equal external accelerations. The results are validated by ensuring conservation of energy and momentum. This approach will be integrated with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver to allow full two-way coupling between the solid and fluid phases.
