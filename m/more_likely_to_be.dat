5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> artefacts {{at the end of}} their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E

50|$|Gender {{shapes the}} risk, context, and {{consequences}} of victimization. According to government statistics, {{with the exception of}} rape, men <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than women <b>to</b> <b>be</b> victims of all violent crimes. However, women are underrepresented as victims in official data, and are much <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than men <b>to</b> <b>be</b> targets of certain types of victimization, such as rape and domestic violence. Women <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> victims of child abuse than men and <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have experienced abuse at an early age.|$|R

5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as breast-feeding and changing diapers. Some theorize that {{this has to do}} with the idea of women as having a natural instinct towards motherhood. Fathers, on the other hand, have been <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> portrayed in play activities with their children and are often <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shown interacting with sons than daughters.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{linguists}} {{claim that}} panlectal grammars have psychological validity, and polylectal diasystems are much <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cognitively real for bilingual and bidialectal speakers, speakers {{of only one}} dialect or language may still {{be aware of the}} differences between their own speech and that of other varieties.|$|E

5|$|Another {{study found}} that the risk of {{predation}} for a bird targeted by a Eurasian sparrowhawk or northern goshawk increased 25-fold if the prey was infected with the blood parasite Leucocytozoon, and birds with avian malaria were 16 times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries. The researchers found lesions like those caused by stress fractures on a dromaeosaurid hand claw, {{one of only two}} such claw lesions discovered {{in the course of the}} study. Stress fractures in the hands have special behavioral significance compared to those found in the feet, since stress fractures there can be obtained while running or during migration. Hand injuries, by contrast, are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> obtained while in contact with struggling prey.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to mortality, {{cancer is a}} cause of considerable morbidity in women. Women have a lower lifetime probability of being diagnosed with cancer (38% vs 45% for men), but are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> diagnosed with cancer at an earlier age.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans and Inuit are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{infected}} with colds and develop complications such as otitis media than Caucasians. This {{may be explained}} by issues such as poverty and overcrowding rather than by ethnicity.|$|E

5|$|In a Swiss {{study of}} the {{nominate}} subspecies, 76% of eggs hatched, and 58% of chicks fledged. Birds of the race A. s. blakistoni in the Tian Shan hatched 90% of their eggs, and hatchlings survived to fledging in 47% of the nests. In the latter study, early nests {{were more likely to}} fail because less plant cover made them <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found by predators. Neither the average lifespan nor the maximum age of survival are known.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the habitat requirements– such as humidity, temperature, soil {{composition}} and water content– of B.nothofagi. However, as the species seems to only occur together with N.fusca, it should largely conform to their demands. The tree species prefers lowlands and hills along river valleys and usually grows on nutrient-rich, well-drained soil. The species is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found inland than in the coastal regions.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{well-documented}} {{association between}} criminal behavior and victimization among female offenders. That said, {{the age and}} gendered patterns of victimization risk, context, and consequences are highly visible and exacerbated among incarcerated women. There <b>is</b> evidence <b>to</b> support that women involved with crime often have extensive histories of physical and sexual abuse. Female offenders <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> abused than male offenders and <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> victimized than female non-offenders. A survey of national correctional populations found that over half of female inmates have been physically or sexually abused, compared to fewer than one in five male inmates.|$|R
5|$|The Buckleyi Group {{contains}} all cultivars {{with at least}} some features clearly showing inheritance from S. russelliana: stem segments with rounded, more symmetrical teeth; more or less symmetrical (regular) flowers which hang down, below the horizontal; and pollen which is pink.

5|$|The {{cell lines}} of origin {{are not fully}} understood. The {{mechanism}} may involve abnormal activation of stem cells. In the proximal airways, stem cells that express keratin 5 are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affected, typically leading to squamous-cell lung carcinoma. In the middle airways, implicated stem cells include club cells and neuroepithelial cells that express club cell secretory protein. Small-cell lung carcinoma may be derived from these cell lines or neuroendocrine cells, and may express CD44.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} (1–3 in Ayt Ayache and Ayt Ndhir) {{cardinal}} numerals have native Berber and borrowed Arabic forms.

The retention of one is also motivated {{by the fact that}} Berber languages near-universally use unity as a determiner.|$|E
