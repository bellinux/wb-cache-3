40|$|Foraminifera from samples {{collected}} in {{the lower part of}} the Ocozocoautla Formation were studied. This sequence crops out north-west of Tuxtla Gutiérrez in central part of Chiapas state in south-eastern Mexico. The lower part of the unit consists mostly of argillaceous and <b>marly</b> <b>sandstone</b> with inoceramids. This horizon yields a poorly preserved but biostratigraphically useful foraminiferal assemblage. The upper part of the Gansserina gansseri zone is defi ned on the basis of the planktic foraminiferal association. An early Maastrichtian age has been assigned, rather than late Campanian-Maastrichtian as previously determined in the literature. The environment was interpreted as outer shelf-upper slope with Tethyan affi nities, on the basis of the benthic and planktic foraminiferal association...|$|E
40|$|Tree {{exploration}} {{drill holes}} were dug in the Neogene Middle Pliocene sediments {{in the vicinity}} of the village of Bac for the investigation of the mineral water and CO 2 gas. The first drill hole (B 1) was dug 30 m in depth indicated a water bearing horizon in o to 26. 4 m thick grey <b>marly</b> <b>sandstone</b> with a free level aquifer and ground water 2. 2 m at depth and yield of 10 l/s. The second and third drill holes (ED- 1 and ED- 2) were dug 301 m to depth and determined a free level aquifer, a sub artesian aquifer and four horizons with artesian aquifers. Mineral water and CO 2 gas were determined. The yield of mineral water in both drill holes amounted to 40 l/s, and CO 2 gas to 2. 16 t/h. Battery testing with self potential flow yielded 60 l/s mineral water and 3. 238 t/h CO 2 gas for both well...|$|E
40|$|During the two mainshocks of September 26, 1997 in the Umbria-Marche border a strong-motion accelerograph {{recorded}} peak ground accelerations {{as large}} as 0. 6 g, approximately, {{in the town of}} Nocera Umbra, at distances of 10 to 15 km from the epicentres. This value is significantly larger than expected {{on the basis of the}} usual regressions with magnitude and distance. A broad-band amplification up to a factor of 10 was consistently estimated in previous papers, using both weak and strong motion data recorded at the accelerograph site during local moderate earthquakes. To study the cause of this amplification we deployed six seismologic stations across the tectonic contact between the Ceno-Mesozoic limestone and the Mesozoic <b>marly</b> <b>sandstone</b> where the accelerograph is installed. Seismograms of 21 shallow aftershocks in the magnitude range from 2. 2 to 4. 0 and a subcrustal Mw = 5. 3 event are analysed. Regardless of epicentre location, waveforms show a large complexity in an approximately 200 m wide band adjacent to the tectonic contact. This is interpreted as the effect of trapped waves in the highly fractured, lower velocity materials within the fault zone...|$|E
40|$|The {{salinity}} of {{the waters}} of the detritic aquifer of Bou Ahmed (Morocco) is very diverse. Based on their hydrogeochemistry, two types of water have been differentiated. The less saline group of waters (electrical conductivity less than 1. 500 μS/cm) {{is directly related to the}} surface waters of the two rivers that feed the aquifer. The more saline group (1. 000 μS/cm - 3. 900 μS/cm) corresponds to sampling points along the valley sides. Their greater salinity is a consequence of the longer contact time with the <b>marly</b> <b>sandstones,</b> which has allowed ion exchange processes to develop. In addition, waters have an elevated HCO 3 - content as a result of the influence of a deep source of CO...|$|R
6000|$|Fifteen {{minutes of}} hard {{paddling}} landed us at Selele, a stony point between two sandy baylets: amongst {{the mass of}} angular boulders a tree again showed the highest flood-mark to be 13 feet. Here {{for the first time}} I remarked the black glaze concerning which so much has been written.[FN#28] The colour is a sunburnt black, tinted ferruginous red like meteoric stones, and it is generally friable, crumbling under the nails. It tastes strongly of iron, which flavours almost every spring in the country, yet the most likely places do not show this incrustation. Sometimes it looks like a matrix in which pudding- stone has been imbedded; it may be two or three lines in thickness and it does not colour the inside. At other times it hardly measures the thickness of paper, coating the gneiss slabs like plumbago. Humboldt tells us ("Personal Narrative," [...] ii. 243, Bohn), that the [...] "Indians" [...] of the Atures declare the rocks to be burnt (carbonized) by the sun's rays, and I have often found the same black glaze upon the <b>marly</b> <b>sandstones</b> that alternate with calcareous formations where no stream ever reached them--for instance, on the highlands of Judea, between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea; in inner Istria, and in most countries upon the borders of the Mediterranean.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{geologic}} {{evolution of}} the South Armenian Block (SAB) in the Mesozoic is reconstructed from a structural, metamorphic, and geochronologic study including U–Pb and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating. The South Armenian Block Crystalline Basement (SABCB) outcrops solely in a narrow tectonic window, NW of Yerevan. The study of this zone provides key and unprecedented information concerning closing of the Northern Neotethys oceanic domain north of the Taurides-Anatolides platform from the Middle Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous. The basement comprises of presumed Proterozoic orthogneiss overlain by metamorphosed pelites as well as intrusions of granodiorite and leucogranite during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. Structural, geochronological and petrological observations show a multiphased {{evolution of the}} northern margin of the SAB during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. A south-dipping subduction under the East Anatolian Platform-South Armenian Block (EAP-SAB) is proposed in order to suit recent findings pertaining emplacement of relatively hot subduction related granodiorite {{as well as the}} metamorphic evolution of the crystalline basement in the Lesser Caucasus area. The metamorphism is interpreted as evidencing: (1) M 1 Barrovian MP–MT conditions (staurolite–kyanite) at c. 157 – 160 Ma and intrusion of dioritic magmas at c. 150 – 156 Ma, (2) near-adiabatic decompression is featured by partial melting and production of leucogranites at c. 153 Ma, followed by M 2 HT–LP conditions (andalusite–K-feldspar). A phase of shearing and recrystallization is ascribed to doming at c. 130 – 150 Ma and cooling at 400 °C by c. 123 Ma (M 3). Structural observations show (1) top to the north shearing during M 1 and (2) radial extension during M 2. The extensional event ends by emplacement of a thick detrital series along radial S, E and W-dipping normal faults. Further, the crystalline basement is unconformably covered by Upper Cretaceous-Paleocene series dated by nannofossils, evolving from Maastrichtian <b>marly</b> <b>sandstones</b> to Paleocene limestones...|$|R
40|$|The Miocene Termina Formation of the {{northern}} Apennines (Italy) contains thin marly limestone or <b>marly</b> <b>sandstone</b> bodies rich in macrofauna mainly consisting of large lucinid clams. Modern representatives of this fauna occur in cold seep settings where they house chemosymbiotic bacteria. Moreover, these rocks record a delta 13 C-depletion confirming their origin influenced by a cold seep. The Miocene sections of Sasso delle Streghe and Sarsetta (near Modena) represent classic examples of cold seeps. These sections consist of marls and marly sandstones, respectively, with lucinids (Sasso delle Streghe) or bioclastic sands with lucinids (Sarsetta); both sections are capped by the Sandstones of Montebaranzone. They yield ostracodes that are mainly represented by deep-water filter-feeder species (Platycopa, i. e. Cytherella sp.) and numerous deposit-feeders (Podocopa: i. e. Neonesidea and Krithe), together with species frequently occurring in shallow water environments. These assemblages are able to colonize disaerobic environments such as cold seeps. Although some authors consider the filter-feeders as dominant taxa in disaerobic settings, our data do not provide evidence of {{significant differences in the}} ostracode assemblage composition between the deposits originated in seafloors with or without seepage influence. However, the number of specimens is greater in seafloors devoid of seepage influence...|$|E
40|$|An imbricated Mesozoic to Palaeogene {{continental}} margin sequence is juxtaposed with ophiolitic {{rocks in the}} East Arm of Sulawesi, Indonesia. The two tectonic terranes are bounded by the Batui Thrust and Balantak Fault System, which {{are considered to be}} the surface expression of the collision zone between the Banggai-Sula Platform and the Eastern Sulawesi Ophiolite Belt. The collision complex contains three distinctive sedimentary sequences : 1) Triassic-Palaeogene {{continental margin}} sediments, ii) Cretaceous pelagic sediments and iii) Neogene coarse clastic sediments and volcanogenic turbidites. (i) Late Triassic Lemo Beds consisting largely of carbonate-slope deposits and subsidiary clastics including quartz-rich lithic sandstones and lensoidal pebbly mudstone and conglomeratic breccia. The hemipelagic limestones are rich in micro-fossils. Some beds of the limestone contain bivalves and ammonites, including Misolia, which typifies the Triassic-Jurassic sequence of eastern Indonesia. The Jurassic Kapali Beds are dominated by quartzose arenites containing significant amounts of plant remains and lumps of coal. The Late Jurassic sediments consist of neritic carbonate deposits (Nambo Beds and Sinsidik Beds) containing ammonites and belemnites, including Belemnopsis uhligi Stevens, of Late Jurassic age. The Jurassic sediments are overlain unconformably by Late Cretaceous Luok Beds which are predominantly calcilutite with chert nodules rich in microfossils. The Luok Beds are unconformably overlain by the Palaeogene Salodik Limestones which consist of carbonate platform sediments rich in both benthic and planktonic foraminifera of Eocene to Early Miocene age. These sediments were deposited on the continental margin of the Banggai-Sula Platform. (ii) Deep-sea sediments (Boba Beds) consist largely of chert and subsidiary calcilutite rich in radiolaria of Cretaceous age. These rocks are part of an ophiolite suite. (iii) Coarse clastic sediments (Kolo Beds and Biak Conglomerates) are typical post-orogenic clastic rocks deposited on top of the collision complex. They are composed of material derived from both the continental margin sequence and ophiolite suite. Volcanogenic Lonsuit Turbidites occur {{in the northern part of}} the East Arm in Poh Head and unconformably overlie the ophiolite suite. Late Miocene to Pliocene planktonic foraminifera occur in the intercalated marlstone and <b>marly</b> <b>sandstone</b> beds within these rocks. The collision zone is marked by the occurrence of Kolokolo Melange, which contain exotic fragments detached from both the ophiolite suite and the continental margin sequence and a matrix of calcareous mudstone and marlstone rich in planktonic foraminifera of late Middle Miocene to Pliocene age. The melange is believed to have been formed during and after the collision of the Banggai-Sula Platform with the Eastern Sulawesi Ophiolite Belt. Hence, the collision event took place in Middle Miocene time. The occurrence of at least three terraces of Quaternary coraline reefs on the south coast of the East Arm of Sulawesi testifies to the rapid uplift of the region. Seismic data suggest that the collision might still be in progress at the present time. <p...|$|E
40|$|The Upper Jurassic of Rida {{consists}} of three depositional sequences. The HST of the lower one (Oxfordian Sequence) corresponds to the marls and <b>marly</b> limestone and <b>sandstone</b> of {{the lower part of}} the Sot de Chera Fm. The reported data and the correlation to proximaler areas of the basin allows to precise the age of the upper boundary of the sequence (topmost Planula Subbiozone,). The identification of an unconformity on top of the Rida Mb (middle part of the Loriguilla Fm) allows to differentiate two sequences (Kimmeridgian sequence- 1 and Kimmeridgian sequence- 2), in which the TST and the HST have been recognized. The age of the boundary between both sequences is located in the middle late Kimmeridgia...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of pre-Holocene paleo-relief gives vital {{information on the}} landscape's evolution and the thickness of loose Holocene sediments {{in the city of}} Piraeus and neighboring township of Neo Faliro in Greece. For that purpose, borehole and geophysical data have been analyzed with the collaboration of geomorphologists and geophysicists. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) sections and boreholes have detected formations of various grain size, permeability and compaction. The results have shown that there is a depression between the Piraeus peninsula and Neo Faliro, shallow at the western part, and deeper at the east-southeastern region of the study area. Three main litho-stratigraphic units were also detected. The oldest and deepest was unit 3 which consisted of Pre-Holocene deposits of Marls, <b>marly</b> limestones, <b>sandstones</b> and conglomerates dating to the Pliocene-Pleistocene age. The upper region of unit 2 consisted of loose Holocene sediments of sand (with the latter corresponding to marine, lagoonal and fluvial depositional environments). Unit 1 was the youngest one, consisting of colluvial deposits, archaeological strata and human deposits (rambles). ERT profiles, even in coastal, very conductive environments in cities, can provide useful information to the geomorphologists...|$|R
40|$|The Rhenodanubian Flysch of the {{northern}} Vienna Forest is composed of various layers of <b>sandstones,</b> <b>marly</b> shales, calcareous marls, and clay shists, which are covered by Quaternary periglacial cover beds and loess deposits. This area at {{the margin of the}} eastern Alps represents an undulating landscape of the Austrian low-mountain regions. The Vienna Forest Flysch region is considered to be susceptible to landslides. Both petrography of the bedrock and soil mechanical properties of the Quaternary sediments control the current slope dynamics in the study area. In a temporal context it is evident that the stability of slopes exceeding 27 ∘ is controlled by a succession of several steps of slope formation. On the basis of field surveys, laboratory analyses, and slope stability modelling, results from investigations on recent landslides demonstrate five different phases of slope formation. In general, after passing these phases the stability of studied slopes is increased, due to the different soil mechanical properties of the potential sliding masses...|$|R
40|$|Lithological {{boundaries}} {{provide information}} useful for {{activities such as}} mineral and hydrocarbon exploration, water resource surveys, and natural hazard evaluation. Automated detection of lithological boundaries reduces bias inherent in expert interpretation of boundaries and thus improves the reliability of lithological mapping. The Rotation Variant Template Matching (RTM) algorithm was applied to ASTER imagery to detect pre-defined lithological boundaries. Templates incorporating the mineral combinations gypsum-calcite and calcite-illite were designed to detect boundaries between evaporites, <b>marly</b> limestone, and <b>sandstone.</b> The RTM algorithm successfully detected lithological boundaries by rotating the templates over the ASTER imagery. The accuracy of the detected boundaries was spatially assessed using fuzzy set theory. Boundaries from a published geological map and boundaries interpreted from a stereo pair of aerial photos by five experts were used as references for assessing the accuracy. A confidence region unifying spatial errors was defined for the geological map and stereo-pair interpretation to provide boundary zones from these references. The correspondence between detected boundaries and the boundary zones of the aerial photo was better than between detected boundaries and boundary zones of the geological map...|$|R
40|$|A direct {{relation}} {{exists between the}} kinematic evolution of thrust-related folds and the 4 -D distribution of the related deformational features. Templates of deformation patterns associated to thrust-related folding mechanisms have been produced by using geometrical modelling. This technique implies homogenous material and a qualitative relation among number, angle, and sense of bending. Deformation patterns produced by geometrical modelling consist of an array of deformation panels limited by either active or fixed axial surfaces. The distribution of deformational features within deformation panels {{is assumed to be}} homogeneous because mechanical properties of deforming multilayers (mechanical stratigraphy) are difficult to include in geometrical modelling. This is a major limitation when attempting to closely predict the actual distribution of deformational features in natural thrust-related anticlines. The mechanical stratigraphy exerts a first order control on deformation patterns in fault-related folds. In this contribution, we present results of hybrid cellular automata (HCA) numerical experiments designed to study the influence of the mechanical stratigraphy on the geometrical and deformational architecture of thrust-related anticlines. The evolution of fault-related structures in HCA experiments progresses in environmental conditions that closely match the natural ones. This, coupled with the implementation of complex mechanical stratigraphies, produces geometrical and deformational architectures that can be successfully compared with the natural ones. Simulated mechanical units span from massive limestones, to well bedded <b>marly</b> limestones, <b>sandstones,</b> and marls, up to clays. Bed thickness can be set to less than 1 cm. These mechanical units are combined in different ways for producing several model mechanical stratigraphies. Our experiments show that the introduction of a detailed mechanical stratigraphy into numerical modelling tools, designed to simulate the spatial distribution of folding-related deformational features, can significantly alter predictions obtained in geometrically-derived deformation panels. The concept of deformation panel retains its validity when fracture frequency comparisons in different locations along folds are made using the same mechanical unit...|$|R
40|$|This work {{shows the}} results {{obtained}} after {{the analysis of the}} Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) of 29 sites sampled on Aptian-Albian marls, <b>marly</b> limestones, fine <b>sandstones</b> and lutites. The study area is located on {{the northern part of the}} central sector of the Basque-Cantabrian basin. Fifteen sites were sampled on syn-diapiric rocks related to the Bakio and Bermeo diapirs, on their halokinetic sequences, whereas 14 sites were done on rocks from the same age but do not affected by diapir growth in order to compare them. The parameters Km, Pj and T show typical values of weakly deformed rocks and only vary in function of lithology. The magnetic foliation of almost all sites is parallel to bedding, suggesting it reflects depositional and compaction processes. Whereas the orientation of the magnetic lineation, always contained on the bedding plane, varies between sites sampled on the halokinetic sequences and the rest of sites. In detail, in the Bakio diapir, the magnetic lineation is parallel to the diapir flanks suggesting a possible control related to its growth.

40|$|Nine {{samples were}} {{collected}} from a 3 m thick section of the Gratteri Formation cropping out at Casa Asciutto, near Isnello (Madonie Mts.) consisting of yellow silty marls alternating to bioclastic <b>marly</b> and quartzy <b>sandstones,</b> rich in displaced larger foraminifers such as lepidocyclinids (Nephrolepidina and Eulepidina), and nummulitids (Heterostegina and Operculina). Planktonic foraminifers are badly preserved or absent through the section because of dissolution. The pre - sence of displaced specimens of Nephrolepidina praemarginata, which was {{the object of a}} biometrical analysis for the embryonic apparatus, dates the studied section at least late Rupelian. In the silty marl layers deep water agglutinated foraminifers (DWAF) and bathyal hyaline foraminifers are frequent; 36 agglutinated and 26 hyaline species of benthic foraminifers, some of which in open nomenclature, were identified. Upsection the specific diversity tends to decrease, whereas the quartz supply increases and assemblages become exclusively constituted by agglutinated DWAF with predominant tubular suspension feeding taxa. In three samples few, badly preserved and displaced gastropods belonging to Architectonicidae, Ampullinidae, Trochidae, Cerithiopsidae, Rissoidae and Pyramidellidae were recognized. The Gratteri Formation deposited during the late Rupelian in a basin periodically affected by gravitative and turbiditic flows, which carried basinward coeval shallow-water larger foraminifers and gastropods. The dissolution of the most calcareous taxa is imputed to the fluctuations and local rise of the calcite compensation depth (CCD) or, more likely, to reducing conditions in bottom sediments...|$|R
