40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most {{widespread}} cancer in women in the world; it manifests mostly in two forms: <b>microcalcifications</b> and massive lesions.

Subjects and methodsSixty-two cases with suspicious <b>microcalcifications</b> detected on mammographic examination had been re-evaluated by MicroPure US. The studied cases underwent true cut tissue/surgical excision biopsy. Histopathology revealed 25 benign and 37 malignant lesions and was considered the gold standard of reference. ResultsMalignant <b>microcalcifications</b> were easier to be visible at MicroPure US, as they were detected in 86. 5 % (n= 32 / 39) compared to only 68 % (n= 17 / 25) of the benign lesions. US depicted more breast masses associated with malignant <b>microcalcifications</b> in 78 % (n= 29 / 37) than those associated with benign ones seen in 36 % (n= 9 / 25). Visibility of suspicious <b>microcalcifications</b> at US was aided by preliminary mammogram.

40|$|Objective: Root canal obliterations {{may pose}} {{esthetic}} and clinical problems or {{may even be}} {{a risk factor for}} tooth survival. <b>Microcalcifications</b> in the pulp can be so extensive that the entire root canal system becomes obliterated. Since bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteopontin (OPN) are involved in both physiological and pathological mineralization processes, our hypothesis was that these two bone-related noncollagenous proteins are present in <b>microcalcifications</b> of the pulp. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to characterize the nature of <b>microcalcifications</b> in the pulp of aged human teeth. Methods: From a large collection of human teeth, 10 were found to exhibit pulpal <b>microcalcifications.</b> The teeth were extracted for periodontal reasons from 39 - 60 year old patients. After fixation in aldehydes and decalcification, teeth were processed for embedding in LR White resin for analysis in the light and transmission electron microscope. For the detection of BSP and OPN, post-embedding high resolution immunocytochemistry was applied. Results: The <b>microcalcifications</b> were round or elongated, occasionally coalescing, and intensely stained with toluidine blue.

We compared the textural parameters obtained from specimen PAIs between samples with punctate <b>microcalcifications</b> on specimen radiography and those without <b>microcalcifications.</b> RESULTS: On specimen US, the mean value (2748. 4 ± 862. 5) of samples with <b>microcalcifications</b> on specimen radiography was higher than that (1961. 9 ± 780. 2) of those without <b>microcalcifications</b> (P = 0. 007).

IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 62 (4), 1203 - 1214. Goal: The {{presence}} of <b>microcalcification</b> clusters {{is a primary}} sign of breast cancer; however, it is difficult and time consuming for radiologists to classify microcalcifications as malignant or benign. In this paper, a novel method for the classification of <b>microcalcification</b> clusters in mammograms is proposed. Methods: The topology/connectivity of individual microcalcifications is analysed within a cluster using multiscale morphology. This is distinct from existing approaches that tend {{to concentrate on the}} morphology of individual microcalcifications and/or global (statistical) cluster features. A set of <b>microcalcification</b> graphs are generated to represent the topological structure of <b>microcalcification</b> clusters at different scales. Subsequently, graph theoretical features are extracted which constitute the topological feature space for modelling and classifying <b>microcalcification</b> clusters. k-Nearest Neighbours based classifiers are employed for classifying <b>microcalcification</b> clusters. Results:The validity of the proposed method is evaluated using two well-known digitised datasets (MIAS and DDSM) and a full-field digital dataset. High classification accuracies (up to 96 %) and good ROC results (area under the ROC curve up to 0. 96) are achieved.

Conclusion: The results indicate that the proposed approach is able to outperform the current state-of-the-art methods.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{retrospectively}} {{investigate the}} diagnostic value of breast MRI {{in patients with}} BI-RADS 3 - 5 <b>microcalcifications</b> in mammography. METHODS: Eighty-four patients with BI-RADS 3 - 5 <b>microcalcifications</b> on mammography underwent breast MR exams before surgical biopsy with a hookwire position under mammographic guidance. Two radiologists reviewed each lesion with BI-RADS by consensus. The diagnostic value of mammography and MRI was compared. RESULTS: Histopathological examination revealed 49 benign lesions and 42 malignant lesions. In the assessments of mammography, 21 lesions (23. 1 %) were assigned to category 3, 51 lesions (56. 0 %) to category 4, and 19 lesions (20. 9 %) to category 5. The area under the receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve for mammography and MR assessment was 0. 844, and 0. 945, respectively (p< 0. 05). In cases of category 3 <b>microcalcifications,</b> the specificity of mammography and MR was 100 %, and 95. 2 % (p =  1. 000), respectively.

Therefore, 3  T-MR imaging for lesions with <b>microcalcification</b> might have sufficiently high sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy to decide the indications for SVAB. 3  T-MR imaging {{may be useful to}} determine candidate lesions for SVAB after mammography detects <b>microcalcification.</b> When the candidate lesion shows abnormal enhancement along with calcification, it should be subjected to SVAB. If the lesion has no abnormal enhancement on MR imaging, follow up could be a good choice.|$|E
40|$|Purpose This study aims to {{investigate}} sensitivity of breast {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) for mammographic microcalcifications-only ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), based on its histopathology and mammographic extent of <b>microcalcifications.</b> Methods Mammograms were reviewed to measure the extent of <b>microcalcifications.</b> Sensitivity of MRI was calculated in the overall study population and in groups differing for DCIS nuclear grade, microinvasivity, and microcalcifications' extent. Results Overall sensitivity of MRI was 78. 3 % for dynamic contrast enhanced and 66. 7 % for diffusion-weighted imaging and did not vary with nuclear grade and microinvasivity, while it increased with larger extent of <b>microcalcifications</b> (ExpB= 1. 063 – 1. 046, P=. 037 –. 013). Conclusions Mammographic extent of <b>microcalcifications</b> positively affects sensitivity of breast MRI...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multiresolution {{approach to the}} computer aided detection of clustered <b>microcalcifications</b> in digitized mammograms based on Gabor elementary functions. A bank of Gabor functions with varying spatial extent and tuned to different spatial frequencies {{is used for the}} extraction of <b>microcalcifications</b> characteristics. Classification is performed by an Artificial Neural Network with supervised learning. First results show that most <b>microcalcifications,</b> isolated or clustered, are detected by our algorithm with a 95 % value both for sensibility and specificity as measured on a test data set...|$|R
40|$|The entity of pure flat {{epithelial}} atypia {{remains a}} challenge due to controversy of the surgical management of residual <b>microcalcifications</b> after core needle biopsies. This study aims {{to assess the}} morphological data observed in immediate surgical resection specimen of residual <b>microcalcifications</b> after a diagnosis of pure flat epithelial atypia on mammotome core biopsy. Sixty-two mammotome core biopsy with a diagnosis of pure flat epithelial atypia (flat epithelial atypia without associated atypical ductal hyperplasia, in situ and/or invasive carcinoma) were identified. From these 62 cases, 20 presented residual <b>microcalcifications</b> and underwent an immediate surgical excision after mammotome. Of the 20 patients with excised <b>microcalcifications,</b> 8 (40 %) cases had residual pure flat epithelial atypia, 4 (20 %) cases had atypical ductal hyperplasia, 4 (20 %) cases had lobular in situ neoplasia, no lesions were retrieved in 4 (20 %) case. None of the patients had either in situ ductal carcinoma and/or invasive carcinoma. Surgical resection of residual <b>microcalcifications</b> after the diagnosis of pure flat epithelial atypia on core needle biopsy remains still a debate. The present study shows no cases of in situ ductal and/or invasive carcinoma on immediate excision of residual <b>microcalcifications</b> after mammotome core biopsies. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
