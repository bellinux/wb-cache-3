50|$|The {{potential}} of the Internet to consolidate and manipulate information has a new application in data aggregation, also known as screen scraping. The Internet gives users the opportunity to consolidate their usernames and passwords, or PINs. Such consolidation enables consumers to access {{a wide variety of}} PIN-protected websites containing personal information by using one <b>master</b> <b>PIN</b> on a single website. Online account providers include financial institutions, stockbrokers, airline and frequent flyer and other reward programs, and e-mail accounts. Data aggregators can gather account or other information from designated websites by using account holders' PINs, and then making the users' account information available to them at a single website operated by the aggregator at an account holder's request. Aggregation services may be offered on a standalone basis or in conjunction with other financial services, such as portfolio tracking and bill payment provided by a specialized website, or as an additional service to augment the online presence of an enterprise established beyond the virtual world. Many established companies with an Internet presence appear to recognize the value of offering an aggregation service to enhance other web-based services and attract visitors. Offering a data aggregation service to a website may be attractive because of the potential that it will frequently draw users of the service to the hosting website.|$|E
40|$|The {{electronic}} component V-I characteristics express {{a relationship between}} the current flowing via a chosen couple of pins, and the voltage applied on those pins. That voltage varies between two safe, for the component health limits, during the V-I characteristic recording. The applied voltage variation follows a certain function like sinus or ramp. The V-I characteristics of an individual component type can differ according to production technology, according to a particular manufacturer, or according to measurement conditions itself. Those so called natural differences can be registered by the study of statistically significant component population with known origin and history, and they can be subsumed in the comparison <b>master</b> <b>pin</b> print. That comparison <b>master</b> <b>pin</b> print is subsequently used as a criterion for discovering differences caused by improper treatment, failure or by the counterfeiting process. The article illustrates a counterfeit detector application for comparative V-I characteristics analysis aimed at a relevant knowledge base development for particular production technologies and component types...|$|E

5000|$|Dean recalled, [...] "Dad's body {{men could}} remove and replace fenders, bumpers and {{anything}} that unbolted, but little else. He used this outside fellow, who owned a tin building with a dirt floor, to do the serious repair that called for replacing quarter-panels and lead work, and his name was Bill Hines. Bill let me hang around and watch him work, and {{he taught me how}} to work lead and do other neat custom tricks."Dean <b>mastered</b> <b>pin</b> striping and began earning extra cash. He also started chopping tops, which very few people were doing at the time. He was a member of the Down River Modified car club. After high school, he went to Pasadena, California and studied at the Art Center College of Design under famous automotive designer Strother MacMinn.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} match {{of the actual}} event Carlito faced Chris Masters. In the beginning, Carlito had the {{advantage}} over Masters, as he performed a splash and Springboard Back elbow on Masters. Masters, however, gained the advantage and executed a Powerbomb. Carlito performed a Back Cracker. Carlito then <b>pinned</b> <b>Masters</b> while using the ropes for leverage to win the match.|$|R
50|$|The link plates fit together, {{and connect}} the chain by feeding their pins through the {{bushings}} {{of the inner}} plates, from opposite sides. In this way the pair form a loosely interconnected, closed set, with each <b>master</b> link's <b>pin</b> located in the slot of the other, and the two bushings held captive. The connection is then made secure by pulling the chain outwards {{on both sides of}} the link. This latter action forces the pin ends into the narrow ends of the slots where they become locked. The overall security of such a master link depends upon the chain being under tension in normal use, though it can fail in extreme conditions where this condition does not hold.|$|R

50|$|A {{master key}} {{operates}} {{a set of}} several locks. Usually, there is nothing special about the key itself, but rather the locks into which it will fit. These master-keyed locks are configured to operate with two, or more, different keys: one specific to each lock (the change key), which cannot operate {{any of the others}} in the set, and the master key, which operates all the locks in the set. Locks that have master keys have a second set of the mechanism used to operate them that is identical to all of the others in the set of locks. For example, <b>master</b> keyed <b>pin</b> tumbler locks often have two shear points at each pin position, one for the change key and one for the master key. A far more secure (and more expensive) system has two cylinders in each lock, one for the change key and one for the master key.|$|R

50|$|Goemon charged {{into the}} battle, wearing Lord Nobunaga's armor and {{carrying}} the repaired double-bladed sword. The armies were fearful and confused {{as they saw}} the crimson armor of Nobunaga. Goemon fought through the armies until he confronted and killed Mitsunari during a solar eclipse. Superstitious over the eclipse, Mitsunari's army fled in fear. Goemon then charged through Tokugawa's army, but Hattori Hanzo appeared and intercepted him mid-way. Goemon immobilized his former <b>master</b> by <b>pinning</b> Hanzo's foot {{to the ground with}} a broken sword blade. Approaching Tokugawa, Goemon closed the distance seemingly with apparent intent to kill, but was intercepted by Sasuke (who had joined Tokugawa's army). Mortally wounded by Sasuke, Goemon staggered and it was revealed that he was only holding Chacha's fan; instead of trying to kill Tokugawa, Goemon only planned to get him to promise that there would finally be peace and then leave. Goemon tries to make his way back to Chacha, but falls to the ground from his wounds. In his final moments, he admires the fireflies and stars while Chacha cries, never to see Goemon again.|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} {{televised}} match, Edge and Chris Masters (representing Raw) faced Rey Mysterio and Matt Hardy (representing SmackDown!). Before the match, Edge refused to wrestle, saying he didn't care about representing Raw and chose Snitsky as his replacement. Masters and Snitsky quickly gained the early {{advantage in the}} match, as they took the upper hand over Mysterio. Mysterio fought back with a tilt-a-whirl, a counterattack hold. Afterwards, Hardy and Snitsky were tagged in, leading to Hardy getting the advantage as he delivered a Side Effect and DDT on Snitsky. Back and forth action took place between both teams. The match ended when Mysterio performed the 619 on Masters, before Hardy performed the Twist of Fate on Snitsky. Mysterio <b>pinned</b> <b>Masters</b> to give SmackDown! the win over Raw.|$|R

The two ambushed Rey Mysterio, leading to a tag match at Taboo Tuesday against Mysterio and Matt Hardy. Edge chose not participate, so Masters teamed with Edge's replacement, Gene Snitsky. Masters and Snitsky lost when Mysterio <b>pinned</b> <b>Masters.</b> At Survivor Series, Masters competed in a five-on-five Survivor Series match between SmackDown! and Raw wrestlers. During the match, there appeared to be a near-break in the Master Lock by Bobby Lashley, who [...] "powered out" [...] of the hold. As the hold was never completely locked in, however, the [...] "Master Lock" [...] had not been officially broken. Masters was eliminated by Rey Mysterio.|$|R
