5000|$|The first European {{hypermarket}} {{is commonly}} mistaken {{to be the}} Carrefour store that opened in 1963, at Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, France, However, the Belgian retailer Grand Bazar preceded Carrefour by two years when it opened three hypermarkets in a short span in 1961 under the name SuperBazar after Belgian law restricting the size of department stores was abolished in January 1961. The first SuperBazar, opened in Bruges on 9 September 1961, initially designed to become a non-food department store, however only covered a surface area of 3300 m2, and was later converted into a regular supermarket. The substantially larger store that opened a week later in Auderghem near Brussels, covering , {{is regarded as a}} more proper hypermarket that brought the concept to fruition. [...] It was Belgian <b>market</b> <b>development</b> <b>engineer</b> , who adopted the concept from his frequent trips to the United States, particularly inspired from the Grand Union's [...] "Grand Way" [...] center in Paramus, New Jersey.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCreativity is {{becoming}} increasingly important in architecture and industrial design. Creativity at conceptual design stage of a design process is a requirement in today's competitive job <b>market.</b> A <b>development</b> <b>engineer</b> produces concept or model that is {{passed on to the}} design engineer for converting into a device, process, or structure. Like the <b>development</b> <b>engineer,</b> the designer should be creative. Today, many major companies and research institutes are using virtual technology. Before prototyping stage, the new product is created virtually in electronic environment with the help of solid modeling softwares. In conceptual design, the object is shaped by making a selection among alternative solutions. This can be easily done in a virtual environment. Education system should be able to feed creative minds by offering some courses and by providing them with opportunities for developing their creativity in art, design, and in servicing. Solid modeling softwares allow students to visualize their creations 3 - dimensionally with the associated physical and mechanical properties. The content of engineering drawing courses in engineering curriculum is to be modified for providing solid modeling techniques to engineering students. This may require additional credit. Solid modeling environment can also be used in primary and secondary education in technology and design, visual arts, geometry, 3 D art and project preparation courses...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between financial development and economic growth for Ireland for the period 1965 - 2007 using a vector error correction model (VECM). Questions were raised whether financial development causes economic growth or reversely {{taking into account the}} positive effect of industrial production index. Financial <b>market</b> <b>development</b> is estimated by the effect of credit <b>market</b> <b>development</b> and stock <b>market</b> <b>development</b> on economic growth. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the long-run relationship between these variables applying the Johansen cointegration analysis taking into account the maximum eigenvalues and trace statistics tests. Granger causality tests indicated that economic growth causes credit <b>market</b> <b>development,</b> while there is a bilateral causal relationship between stock <b>market</b> <b>development</b> and economic growth. Therefore, it can be inferred that economic growth has a positive effect on stock <b>market</b> <b>development</b> and credit <b>market</b> <b>development</b> taking into account the positive effect of industrial production growth on economic growth for Ireland...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the long run}} and causal relationship between stock <b>market</b> <b>development</b> and economic growth for seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test, the study finds that the stock <b>market</b> <b>development</b> is cointegrated with economic growth in Egypt and South Africa. Moreover, this test suggests that stock <b>market</b> <b>development</b> has a significant positive long run impact on economic growth. Granger causality test based on vector error correction model (VECM) further shows that stock <b>market</b> <b>development</b> Granger causes economic growth in Egypt and South Africa. However, Granger causality {{in the context of}} VAR shows evidence of bidirectional relationship between stock <b>market</b> <b>development</b> and economic growth for Cote D'Ivoire, Kenya, Morocco and Zimbabwe. In Nigeria, there is a weak evidence of growth-led finance using market size as indicator of stock <b>market</b> <b>development.</b> Based on these results, the paper argues that stock markets could help promote growth in Africa. However, to achieve this goal, African stock markets need to be further developed through appropriate regulatory and macroeconomic policies.

The study adopted Vector Error Correction mechanism.

The results show that FDI had no significant causal effect on financial <b>market</b> <b>development</b> while there are bidirectional causality between financial <b>market</b> <b>development</b> and exchange rate. In addition, a further analysis of effects of FDI and exchange rate on financial <b>market</b> <b>development</b> showed that both FDI and exchange rate had negative effects on financial market development; thus implying that FDI and macroeconomic instability adversely affect the development and provision of financial services in Nigeria. ...|$|R

This study examines <b>market</b> <b>development</b> using the novel approach of measuring <b>market</b> <b>development</b> by using the number of personal contacts in export markets as the measure of <b>market</b> <b>development</b> activity. Contacts are divided into those who receive training (technical assistance) versus those who were contacted to facilitate trade (trade servicing). As a method of comparison, this study evaluates import demand in two ways: using <b>market</b> <b>development</b> expenditures as well as the numbers of technical assistance or trade service contacts. The study is applied to the grass seed industry, using cross-section time series data.
