5|$|The {{number of}} works {{attributed}} to the trobairitz is estimated at thirty-two songs, but ranges anywhere from 23 to 46. There {{are a number of}} reasons why an exact number is not known. In the courtly love tradition it was common for poems to be written as an exchange of letters, or a debate, as in a tenso. Some of these may have been originally written by one poet; however, some were originally an actual exchange of epistles, later gathered together in a manuscript. Some of these were between men, and some were {{between a man and a}} woman. Some modern editors attribute these solely to the man who originated the exchange, and some attribute them to both the <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> involved. There is a long history of attributing these solely to men, even when all evidence points to the contrary.|$|E

2500|$|Inspirational romance, as {{the market}} exists today, {{combines}} explicitly Christian themes {{with the development of}} a romantic relationship. In 2004, 167 novels were published in the inspirational romance subgenre. These novels typically do not include gratuitous violence or swearing, and the central courtship is chaste. Sex, if it is present at all, occurs after marriage and is not explicitly detailed. Many novels in this genre also focus on the hero or heroine's faith, turning the love story into [...] "a triangle: the <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> and also their relationship with God." [...] When people read inspirational romance novels, they observe subtle details and see the novel more realistically, changing how they perceive the world. Themes such as forgiveness, honesty, and fidelity are common.|$|E

2500|$|Augustine saw {{marriage}} as a covenant between one man and one woman, {{which may not be}} broken. It was the Creator who established monogamy: [...] "Therefore, the first natural bond of human society is man and wife." [...] Such marriage was confirmed by the Saviour in the Gospel of Matthew (Mat 19:9) and by His presence at the wedding in Cana (John 2:2). In the Church—the City of God—marriage is a sacrament and may not and cannot be dissolved as long as the spouses live: [...] "But a marriage once for all entered upon in the City of our God, where, even from the first union of the two, the <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> marriage bears a certain sacramental character, can in no way be dissolved but by the death of one of them." [...] In chapter 7, Augustine pointed out that the Roman Empire forbad polygamy, even if the reason of fertility would support it: [...] "For it is in a man's power to put away a wife that is barren, and marry one of whom to have children. And yet it is not allowed; and now indeed in our times, and after the usage of Rome (nostris quidem iam temporibus ac more Romano), neither to marry in addition, so as to have more than one wife living." [...] Further on he notices that the Church's attitude goes much further than the secular law regarding monogamy: It forbids remarrying, considering such to be a form of fornication: [...] "And yet, save in the City of our God, in His Holy Mount, the case is not such with the wife. But, that the laws of the Gentiles are otherwise, who is there that knows not." ...|$|E
