40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a natural way {{to extend a}} bivariate Powell-Sabin (PS) B-spline <b>basis</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> planar {{polygonal}} domain to a PS B-spline <b>basis</b> defined <b>on</b> <b>a</b> subset of the unit sphere in R^ 3. The spherical basis inherits many properties of the bivariate basis such as local support, the partition of unity property and stability. This allows us to construct a C^ 1 continuous hierarchical <b>basis</b> <b>on</b> the sphere that is suitable for preconditioning fourth-order elliptic problems on the sphere. We show that the stiffness matrix relative to this hierarchical basis has a logarithmically growing condition number, which is a suboptimal result compared to standard multigrid methods. Nevertheless, {{this is a huge}} improvement over solving the discretized system without preconditioning, and its extreme simplicity contributes to its attractiveness. Furthermore, we briefly describe a way to stabilize the hierarchical basis with the aid of the lifting scheme. This yields <b>a</b> wavelet <b>basis</b> <b>on</b> the sphere for which we find a uniformly well-conditioned and (quasi-) sparse stiffness matrix. status: publishe...|$|R
