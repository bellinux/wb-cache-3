Some sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the existence of a equivalent function H(t,x) sending the (c,d) -quasibounded solutions of nonlinear system xΔ=A(t) x+f(t,x) onto those of linear system xΔ=A(t) x.

Decoherence happens when different portions of the system's wavefunction become entangled in different ways with the measuring device. For two einselected elements of the entangled system's state to interfere, both the original system and the measuring in both elements device must significantly overlap, in the scalar product sense. If the measuring device has many degrees of freedom, it is very unlikely for this to happen.|$|E
