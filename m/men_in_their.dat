Blenker was a German immigrant himself, a refugee of the Revolutions of 1848, {{and many of the}} units under his command were heavily German-American. Encamped at Roach's Mills, Virginia, the 68th participated in the defense of Washington, losing three <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> first combat, a minor skirmish with a Confederate patrol.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Le Mesurier {{worked on}} his first film, Death in the Hand, a mystery in which he played the {{character}} Jack Mottram. He went on to appear in over 100films, including Private's Progress (1955), I'm All Right Jack (1959), The Punch and Judy Man (1962), Carlton-Browne of the F.O.

5|$|Sarraj and Bizri wielded {{substantial}} {{influence in}} Syrian politics, checking {{the power of}} the political factions and purging Nasser's opponents from the officer corps. This was a source of concern for Quwatli, but he kept both <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> posts, partially due to pressure from Nasser. Quwatli further solidified his ties with the latter by appointing Akram al-Hawrani, the prominent Arab socialist leader, as speaker of parliament, and Salah al-Din Bitar, the co-founder of the pan-Arabist Ba'ath Party, as foreign affairs minister.|$|E
5|$|Williamson {{was born}} to an upper-middle-class family in the rural Saint Ann Parish. He {{initially}} considered joining the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church, studying for this position in Montego Bay, but eventually decided against this. In 1979, he began to devote himself {{to the cause of}} gay rights in Jamaica, becoming the first individual to do so in such a public manner. Jamaica had a reputation for its widespread anti-gay prejudice, an attitude that pervaded public discourse at all levels of society, with a number of popular Jamaican musicians inciting violence against gay <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lyrics.|$|E

5|$|As in the First World War, white Rhodesians {{volunteered for}} the forces readily and in large numbers. Over 2,700 had come forward before the war was three weeks old. Somewhat ironically, the Southern Rhodesian recruiters' main problem was not {{sourcing}} manpower but rather persuading men in strategically important occupations such as mining to stay home. Manpower controls were introduced to keep certain <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> civilian jobs. The SRAF accepted 500 recruits {{in the days following}} the outbreak of war, prompting its commander Group Captain CW Meredith to contact the Air Ministry in London with an offer to run a flying school and train three squadrons. This was accepted. In January 1940 the Southern Rhodesian government announced the establishment of an independent Air Ministry to oversee the Rhodesian Air Training Group, Southern Rhodesia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS).|$|E
5|$|Garfield's {{promotion}} {{gave him}} {{command of the}} 20th Brigade of the Army of the Ohio, which was ordered in early 1862 to join Major General Ulysses S. Grant's forces as they advanced on Corinth, Mississippi. Before the 20th Brigade arrived, however, Confederate forces under General Albert Sidney Johnston surprised Grant's <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> camps, driving them back. Garfield's troops got word of the battle and advanced quickly, joining {{the rest of the}} army on the second day to drive the Confederates back across the field and into retreat. The action, later known as the Battle of Shiloh, was the bloodiest of the war to date; Garfield was exposed to fire for much of the day, but emerged uninjured. Major General Henry W. Halleck, Grant's superior, took charge of the combined armies and advanced ponderously toward Corinth; when they arrived, the Confederates had fled.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1989 {{the actor}} Jack Douglas and Richard Hope-Hawkins {{organised}} a benefit concert for Terry-Thomas, after discovering {{he was living}} in virtual obscurity, poverty and ill health. The gala, held at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, ran for five hours, and featured 120artists with Phil Collins topping the bill and Michael Caine as the gala chairman. The show raised over £75,000 for Terry-Thomas and Parkinson's UK. The funds from the charity concert allowed Terry-Thomas to move out of his charity flat and into Busbridge Hall nursing home in Godalming, Surrey. He died there on 8 January 1990, at the age of 78. The funeral service was held at St. John the Baptist Church, Busbridge, where the theme from Those Magnificent <b>Men</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> Flying Machines was played; he was cremated at Guildford Crematorium.|$|E

5|$|The Italian Army {{force in}} the area of Primosole Bridge came from the 213 Coastal Division {{commanded}} by General Carlo Gotti. Coastal divisions were second line divisions, usually formed from <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> forties and fifties, and were intended to perform labour or other second line duties. Recruited from the local population, their officers were mostly men who had retired but had then been called up again. Their morale was low, not least because of their second rate equipment and weapons. It had been intended to improve their armaments with equipment seized from the recently disbanded Vichy French army, but when the arms arrived in Sicily, many of them had been made unusable, and some had the wrong type of ammunition or no ammunition at all.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} {{mode of transmission}} of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person. Globally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex; however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2014, most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (83% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 67% of total new diagnoses). In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men. About 15% of gay and bisexual men have HIV while 28 percent of transgender women test positive in the US.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} team, {{made up of}} some of {{the most}} distinguished <b>men</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> fields, included representatives from the United States, Denmark, Norway and France, as well as from Britain and its Empire.

Another Nimrod veteran, the 46-year-old James Murray, was Stefansson's oceanographer. Among the younger scientists were William Laird McKinlay (1889–1983), a 24-year-old science teacher from Glasgow who was recommended by the Scottish explorer William Speirs Bruce, and Bjarn Mamen (1893–1914), a 20-year-old skiing champion from Christiania, Norway, who was taken on as a forester, despite lacking scientific experience.|$|E
