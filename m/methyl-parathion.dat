In this study, we used 11 microsatellite markers to genotype two populations with high levels of resistance to <b>methyl-parathion</b> and aldrin (Polk and Stromsburg), two populations with low and intermediate levels of resistance (Mead and Clay Center) from Nebraska, and one population from outside the Corn Belt (Safford, Arizona). The genetic diversity measured by observed heterozygosity (Ho) was reduced 15 – 32 % in the highly resistant populations compared with the more susceptible populations in Nebraska. Significant genetic differentiation was detected between the resistant and susceptible populations (Polk and Stromsburg versus Mead and Clay Center) in Nebraska (FST = 0. 016) and between all the populations from Nebraska and Arizona (FST = 0. 059). The average observed heterozygosities in the populations were positively correlated with insecticide susceptibility based on mortality at diagnostic concentrations of aldrin and <b>methyl-parathion,</b> respectively. These results indicate that the insecticide selection from exposure to aldrin and <b>methyl-parathion</b> may be a contributing factor in shaping the genetic structure of western corn rootworm populations in Nebraska.

40|$|Relative flight {{behavior}} of methyl-parathion-resistant and -susceptible western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte populations, was studied {{as part of}} a larger effort to characterize the potential impact of insecticide resistance on adult life history traits and to understand the evolution and spread of resistance. A computer interfaced autograph was used to compare flight of resistant and susceptible individuals, and flight of resistant individuals with and without prior exposure to <b>methyl-parathion.</b> In each case, mean trivial and sustained flight durations were compared among treatments. In general, there were few differences in trivial or sustained flight characteristics as affected by beetle population, insecticide exposure, sex, or age and there were few significant interactions among variables. Tethered flight activity was highly variable and distributions of flight duration were skewed toward flights of short duration. Tethered flight activity was similar among resistant and susceptible beetles with the exception that susceptible beetles initiated more flights per beetle than resistant beetles. After sublethal exposure to <b>methyl-parathion,</b> total flight time, total trivial flight time, and mean number of flights per resistant beetle declined significantly. Because long-range flight was uncommon, short- to medium-duration flights may play an important role in determining gene flow and population spread of resistant D. v. virgifera.

40|$|AbstractThe {{organophosphate}} and carbamate pesticides <b>methyl-parathion</b> and carbaryl have {{a common}} action mechanism: they inhibit acetylcholinesterase enzyme by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses. However, they can alter the expression of exocytotic membrane proteins (SNARE), by modifying release of neurotransmitters and other substances. This study evaluated the adverse effects of the pesticides <b>methyl-parathion</b> and carbaryl on expression of SNARE proteins: Syntaxin- 1, Syntaxin- 4 and SNAP- 23 in freshwater rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus. Protein expression of these three proteins was analyzed before and after exposure to these two pesticides by Western Blot. The expression of Syntaxin- 1, Syntaxin- 4 and SNAP- 23 proteins in B. calyciflorussignificantly decreases with increasing concentration of either pesticides. This suggests that organophosphates and carbamates have adverse effects on expression of membrane proteins of exocytosis by altering the recognition, docking and fusion of presynaptic and vesicular membranes involved in exocytosis of neurotransmitters.

A study was conducted to investigate whether surfactants and cyclodextrins can be used to enhance the transport of <b>methyl-parathion</b> in a contaminated soil. At aqueous concentrations of surfactants tested, the proportion of each surfactant sorbed to the soil increased with increasing surfactant concentrations. The maximal adsorbed mass is about 5130 and 14, 200 mu g/g for Brij 35 and Tween 80, respectively in the case of nonionic surfactants, sorption attenuates surfactant effectiveness by increasing the organic carbon content of the soil matrix and retarding transport of <b>methyl-parathion</b> through batch and soil column experiments. However, in contrast with the surfactants, hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD) does not interact with the soil tested.

40|$|We {{validated}} a {{stochastic model}} {{of the evolution of}} resistance to adulticidal sprays of <b>methyl-parathion</b> in western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, populations in Nebraska. The population dynamics predicted by the model resembled that reported for field populations, and time until control failures occurred closely matched reports by commercial crop consultants. We incorporated uncertainty about the values used for 18 model parameters by replacing default values with random draws taken from a normal distribution. One parameter, the initial resistance allele frequency, was no longer measurable because of the evolution of resistance. We therefore proposed five candidate initial allele frequencies and developed probability distributions for the time to resistance for each by running 1000 simulations with parameters randomly varied. These distributions included variation because of stochastic effects as well as parameter uncertainty. We used Bayesian inference to estimate the candidate frequency most likely, given reported times to field control failures. The initial allele frequency of 10 - 4 was most likely (29 %), 10 - 3 was less likely (28 %), whereas 10 - 6 was relatively unlikely (5 %). Results from sensitivity analysis depended upon how evolution of resistance was measured. When resistance was examined as a genetic phenomenon, the rate of increase of the resistance allele depended almost entirely on genetic factors (LC 50 values), the characteristics of the pesticide (residual activity), and the variance associated with emergence of adults. When resistance was measured as failure of <b>methyl-parathion</b> to reduce populations below threshold levels (0. 5 gravid females per plant), parameters that contributed to population growth rate (mortality and fecundity) were also important.

Strains were isolated from water samples amended with 10 and 50 lg/ml of nine pesticides: organochlorinated insecticides (aldrin and lindane), organophosphorous insecticides (dimetoate, <b>methyl-parathion</b> and methidation), s-triazine herbicides (simazine and atrazine), fungicide (captan) and diflubenzuron (1 -(- 4 -chlorophenyl) - 3 -(2, 6 -difluorobenzoyl urea), a chitinase inhibitor. The majority of the strains belonged to the genera Pseudomonas and Aeromonas and only 9 % of the total of strains were Gram positive. From all the strains isolated, only 22 showed a wide growth range in all the pesticides tested and 4 of them were chosen for pesticide removal studies. The genetic identification of these strains showed their affiliation to Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus sp. and Exiguobacterium aurantiacum. These last two strains were those that showed the highest pesticide removal capacities and a high bacterial growth...|$|E
40|$|Commercial <b>methyl-parathion</b> (MeP) was {{detoxified}} {{using an}} electrochemical method that employed a Ti/Pt anode {{and stainless steel}} 304 as cathode. Sodium chloride was added as electrolyte and the mixture was passed through an electrolytic cell for 2 h. Due to the strong oxidizing potential of the produced chemicals, the organic pollutants were wet oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. A number of experiments were run at laboratory scale. Reductions of COD and BOD 5 were both over 80 % and the mean energy consumption was 18 - 8 kWh per kg(- 1) COD reduced (CODr) The degradation of MeP was more effective when the pH of the brine solution was in the acid range than when {{it was in the}} alkaline range. From the results it can be concluded that electrolysis could be used as an oxidation pre-treatment stage for detoxification of toxic wastes with MeP. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.

3000|$|Lead {{exposure}} to H. fossilis provoked hypocalcemia. This derives {{support from the}} studies of Rogers et al. (2003) who have also reported hypocalcemia in lead-exposed rainbow trout. Other investigators have also noticed decreased blood/plasma calcium content of fish treated either with aldrin (Bano 1982; Singh et al. 1996), malachite green (Srivastava et al. 1995), cadmium (Larsson et al. 1981; Muramoto 1981; Giles 1984; Kuroshima 1987; Pratap et al. 1989, Rai and Srivastav Ajai 2003), propoxur (Singh et al. 1997), formothion (Singh et al. 1997), chlorpyrifos (Srivastav Ajai et al. 1997 a), deltamethrin (Srivastav Ajai et al. 1997 b), <b>methyl-parathion</b> (Mishra et al. 2004), cypermethrin (Mishra et al. 2005) or botanical pesticide (Prasad et al. 2011). Contrary to it, an elevation of plasma calcium concentrations has also been reported by other workers from the fish exposed to various toxicants (Sastry and Sharma 1978; Bansal et al. 1979; Sharma et al. 1982). However, no effect on plasma calcium level has been noticed in methoxychlor-exposed Northern puffer Sphaeroides maculatus (Eisler 1967 and DDT-treated flounders Platichthys flesus(Haux [...]) 1979).|$|E
40|$|Intrinsic protein {{fluorescence}} {{is due to}} aromatic amino acids, mainly tryptophan, {{which can}} be selectively measured by exciting at 295 nm. Changes in emission spectra of tryptophan are due to the protein conformational transitions, subunit association, ligand binding or denaturation, which affect the local environment surrounding the indole ring. In this study, tryptophan fluorescence was monitored in intact mitochondria at 333 nm following excitation at 295 nm in presence of insecticides using spectrofluorometer. <b>Methyl-parathion,</b> carbofuran, and endosulfan induced Trp fluorescence quenching and release of cytochrome c when incubated with the mitochondria, except fenvalarate. Mechanism of insecticide-induced mitochondrial toxicity for the tested insecticides has been discussed. Reduction in the intensity of tryptophan emission spectra of mitochondrial membrane proteins in presence of an increasing concentration of a ligand {{can be used to}} study the interaction of insecticides/drugs with the intact mitochondria. Furthermore, this assay can be readily adapted for studying protein–ligand interactions in intact mitochondria and in other cell organelles extending its implications for pesticide and pharma industry and in drug discovery...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the degradation of four pesticides by low-concentration of dissolved ozone {{in order to establish}} the effect of operational parameters. The results indicated that dissolved ozone (initial concentration of 1. 4 mg/l) was effective to oxidize 60 - 99 % of 0. 1 mg/l aqueous diazinon, parathion, <b>methyl-parathion</b> and cypermethrin shortly within 30 min. The feasibilities of applying low dissolved levels of ozone in water (1. 4 - 2. 0 mg/l) to remove the target pesticides residing on vegetable surface (Brassica rapa) were studied. Ozonated water was mostly effective in cypermethrin removal (> 60 %). The efficacy highly depended on the dissolved ozone levels. Higher temperature enhanced the efficacy in pesticide removal; however, the solubility of ozone in water is inversely proportional to temperature. The maximal efficacy for diazinon removal was detected to be at 15 - 20 °C. Major limitation factors for residual pesticide removal are temperature, concentration of ozone gas applied and concentration of dissolved ozone established.

30|$|A {{vast number}} of {{synthetic}} organic compounds, such as PAHs, PCB, and PBDEs, caused water pollution in an extremely low concentration. A major challenge for wastewater treatment was sensing and detecting them rapidly and accurately. For many, nanomaterials were excellent adsorbents; they concentrated pollution to meet the detection threshold. CNTs {{have been used in}} real water samples for organic compounds detection [48]. Au-TiO 2 nanocomposite showed good linear with trace organophosphates (OPs) insecticides at 1.0  ng/ml level [49]. Multifunctional nanotube array based on TiO 2 was used to detect herbicide 4 -chlorophenol (4 -CP), dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and <b>methyl-parathion</b> (MP) [50]. Pathogen and virus have also been regarded as a long-term threat in wastewater. Due to large surface/volume ratios in nano-size devices, NNs depended nano-biosensors were fast and well-timed in some pathogen and virus diagnosis. Quantum dots [51], carbon nanotubes [52], graphene oxide [53], silica [54], and metal nanoparticles [55, 56] were solid foundation for sensor and detection technologies. The present challenges are aimed at eliminating false detection of pathogen and virus in complicated wastewater sample. In addition, research and development on portable and reusable detector will also be a creative endeavor.|$|E
