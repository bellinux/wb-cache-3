5|$|Hoping {{to prevent}} further uprisings, the United States decided to {{strengthen}} its <b>military</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region after the Winnebago War. Fort Crawford was reoccupied, as was Fort Dearborn in Chicago, which had been abandoned in 1823. A new outpost, Fort Winnebago, was built in October 1828 at the portage between the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis is {{the largest}} city by {{population}} in the U.S. state of Minnesota, and the county seat of Hennepin County. The origin and growth {{of the city was}} spurred by the proximity of Fort Snelling, the first major United States <b>military</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, and by its location on Saint Anthony Falls, which provided power for sawmills and flour mills.|$|E
5|$|The Seminole Wars {{increased}} the U.S. <b>military</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Everglades, {{which resulted in}} the exploration and mapping of many regions that had not previously been recorded. The military officers who had done the mapping and charting of the Everglades were approached by Thomas Buckingham Smith in 1848 to consult on the feasibility of draining the region for agricultural use.|$|E

5|$|In mid-November, Allied forces {{attacked}} the Japanese at Buna-Gona in New Guinea. Japanese Combined Fleet naval leaders, headquartered at Truk {{and under the}} overall command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, felt Allied advances in New Guinea posed a greater threat {{to the security of}} the Japanese Empire than an Allied <b>military</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern Solomons. Therefore, Combined Fleet naval staff officers began to prepare plans for abandoning Guadalcanal and shifting priorities and resources to operations around New Guinea. At this time, the navy did not inform the army of their intentions in this regard.|$|E
5|$|The age {{distribution}} was 24.0% {{under the age}} of 18, 18.2% from 18 to 24, 29.9% from 25 to 44, 16.9% from 45 to 64, and 10.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30 years. For every 100 females, there were 104.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 104.8 males. This large gender imbalance is due to the <b>military</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, most notably Naval Station Norfolk.|$|E
5|$|Blas Fajardo Ople (February 3, 1927 – December 14, 2003) was a Filipino {{journalist}} and politician who held several high-ranking {{positions in the}} executive and legislative branches of the Philippine government, including as Senate President from 1999 to 2000, and as Secretary of Foreign Affairs from 2002 until his death. Perceived as a leftist-nationalist {{at the onset of}} his career in public service, Ople was, in his final years, a vocal supporter for allowing a limited United States <b>military</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Philippines, and for American initiatives in the War on Terror including the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the initial}} {{phase of the}} war, the GR1s {{switched}} to medium level strike missions, typical targets for these strikes included munition depots and oil refining facilities. Only the reconnaissance Tornado GR1As continued to operate at the low-altitude high-speed profile throughout the war, the GR1A emerged unscathed despite the inherent danger posed by missions such as conducting pre-attack reconnaissance. In the war's aftermath, Britain maintained a <b>military</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf, around half a dozen GR1s were based at Ali Al Salem airbase in Kuwait for operations over the southern no fly zone as part of Operation Southern Watch; another half a dozen GR1s participated in missions over Northern Iraq in Operation Provide Comfort.|$|E
5|$|Hananu's revolt {{coincided with}} Turkish revolts against the French <b>military</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Anatolian cities of Urfa, Gaziantep and Mar'ash. It also {{was related to}} Barakat's revolt in Antioch, which was {{captured}} and held by Arab guerrillas for a week starting on 13 March 1920. The French Air Force bombarded Antioch for 17 days until the rebels withdrew to Narlija. On 18 April, {{taking advantage of the}} diversion of French forces to Gaziantep where a major battle between French and Turkish forces was taking place, Hananu decided to attack the French garrison at Harim. With fifty of his irregulars, Hananu stormed the town. As word of his attack spread to nearby villages, his forces subsequently swelled to 400.|$|E
5|$|Japan {{planned to}} rapidly seize European colonies in Asia {{to create a}} large {{defensive}} perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific; the Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war. To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise the United States Pacific Fleet and the American <b>military</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Philippines from the outset. On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific. These included {{an attack on the}} American fleet at Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, landings in Thailand and Malaya and the battle of Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the treaty}} with France, Turkish forces in {{southern}} Anatolia continued to support Hananu's rebels with arms {{for a while}} longer to pressure the French further and gain more leverage in negotiations over territorial concessions. At this point in the revolt, the rebels were in control of the villages of the Harim, Antioch, Jisr al-Shughur, Idlib and Maarrat al-Nu'man districts, but not the towns themselves. The French and Hananu entered into negotiations in the village of Kurin near Idlib in April, but they faltered. By order of the French Mandate's High Commissioner, Henri Gouraud, the French reinforced their <b>military</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> greater Aleppo region in April, and their columns defeated Hananu's rebels in a number of confrontations during this period. By April, the French had over 20,000 troops in southern Anatolia and northern Syria, with over 5,000 troops in Aleppo, 4,500 in the Idlib district, 1,000 in Qatma and 5,000 in the Antioch region. In May, French troops commanded by General Goubeau pursued Mawali and Sbaa Bedouin rebels after they launched several attacks against the highway between Homs and Hama. The Mawali surrendered after French aerial bombardments against their encampments in Qatara on 21 May.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1969, Chinese forces {{started the}} Sino–Soviet border conflict. The Sino–Soviet split had chagrined Premier Alexei Kosygin a great deal, {{and for a}} while he refused to accept its irrevocability; he briefly visited Beijing in 1969 due to the {{increase}} of tension between the USSR and China. By the early 1980s, both the Chinese and the Soviets were issuing statements calling for a normalisation of relations between the two states. The conditions given to the Soviets by the Chinese were the reduction of Soviet <b>military</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sino–Soviet border and the withdrawal of Soviets troops in Afghanistan and the Mongolian People's Republic and to end their support for the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. Brezhnev responded in his March 1982 speech in Tashkent where he called for the normalisation of relations. Full Sino–Soviet normalisations of relations would prove to take years, until the last Soviet ruler, Mikhail Gorbachev came to power.|$|E
5|$|While the Suez Crisis caused British {{power in}} the Middle East to weaken, it did not collapse. Britain again {{deployed}} its armed forces to the region, intervening in Oman (1957), Jordan (1958) and Kuwait (1961), though on these occasions with American approval, as the new Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's foreign policy was to remain firmly aligned with the United States. Britain maintained a <b>military</b> <b>presence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East for another decade. On 16 January 1968, {{a few weeks after}} the devaluation of the pound, Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his Defence Secretary Denis Healey announced that British troops would be withdrawn from major military bases East of Suez, which included the ones in the Middle East, and primarily from Malaysia and Singapore by the end of 1971, instead of 1975 as earlier planned. By that time over 50,000 British military personnel were still stationed in the Far East, including 30,000 in Singapore. The British withdrew from Aden in 1967, Bahrain in 1971, and the Maldives in 1976.|$|E
