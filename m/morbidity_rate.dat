40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{externally}} validate EPICON, {{a computerized}} system for grouping diagnoses from EMRs in general practice into episodes of care. These episodes {{can be used}} for estimating <b>morbidity</b> <b>rates.</b> DESIGN: Comparative observational study. MEASUREMENTS: <b>Morbidity</b> <b>rates</b> from an independent dataset, based on episode-oriented EMRs, were used as the gold standard. The EMRs in this dataset contained diagnoses which were manually grouped by GPs. The authors ungrouped these diagnoses and regrouped them automatically into episodes using EPICON. The authors then used these episodes to estimate <b>morbidity</b> <b>rates</b> that were compared to the gold standard. The differences between the two sets of <b>morbidity</b> <b>rates</b> were calculated and the authors analyzed large as well as structural differences to establish possible causes. RESULTS: In general, the <b>morbidity</b> <b>rates</b> based on EPICON deviate only slightly from the gold standard. Out of 675 diagnoses, 36 (5 %) were considered to be deviating diagnoses. The deviating diagnoses showed differences for two main reasons: "differences in rules between the two methods of episode construction" and "inadequate performance of EPICON. " CONCLUSION: The EPICON system performs well for the large majority of the <b>morbidity</b> <b>rates.</b> We can therefore conclude that EPICON is useful for grouping episodes to estimate <b>morbidity</b> <b>rates</b> using EMRs from general practices. <b>Morbidity</b> <b>rates</b> of diseases with a broad range of symptoms should, however, be interpreted cautiously.

40|$|Objectives: In this study, we {{evaluated}} the internal validity of EPICON, {{an application for}} grouping ICPCcoded diagnoses from electronic medical records into episodes of care. These episodes are used to estimate <b>morbidity</b> <b>rates</b> in general practice. Methods: <b>Morbidity</b> <b>rates</b> based on EPICON were compared to a gold standard; i. e. the rates from the second Dutch National Survey of General Practice. We calculated the deviation from {{the gold standard for}} 677 prevalence and 681 incidence rates, based on the full dataset. Additionally, we examined the effect of casebased reasoning within EPICON using a comparison to a simple, not case-based method (EPI- 0). Finally, we used a split sample procedure to evaluate the performance of EPICON. Results: <b>Morbidity</b> <b>rates</b> that are based on EPICON deviate only slightly from the gold standard and show no systematic bias. The effect of case-based reasoning within EPICON is evident. The addition of case-based reasoning to the grouping system reduced both systematic and random error. Although the <b>morbidity</b> <b>rates</b> that are based on the split sample procedure show no systematic bias, they do deviate more from the gold standard than <b>morbidity</b> <b>rates</b> for the full dataset. Conclusions: Results from this study indicate that the internal validity of EPICON is adequate. Assuming that the standard is gold, EPICON provides valid outcomes for this study population. EPICON seems useful for registries in general practice for the purpose of estimating <b>morbidity</b> <b>rates.</b> (aut. ref. ...|$|R

25|$|Conventional {{amphotericin}} B desoxycholate (AmB: {{used since}} the 1950s {{as a primary}} agent) {{is known to be}} associated with increased drug-induced Nephrotoxicity (Renal toxicity) impairing Renal function.

An increase in Eupatorium is attributed as one of the causes for the spread of the deadly Kyasanur forest disease (which has a <b>morbidity</b> <b>rate</b> of 10%) among humans since it harbors tick populations that are vectors for this disease.

40|$|Abstract — Data from {{published}} {{sources and}} unpublished surveys in the U. K. show that average alcohol consumption is lower in Afro-Caribbean {{men and women}} than in native British men and women. The proportion of heavy drinkers is also low in Afro-Caribbeans. Consistent with these consumption data, hospital admission rates for alcohol-related problems are lower in Afro-Caribbeans than in the general population. Among South Asians (Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis) average alcohol consumption is lower than in the native British population but alcohol-related <b>morbidity</b> <b>rates</b> for some South Asian communities are higher than for the general population. The reasons for these high <b>morbidity</b> <b>rates</b> are not clear.

OBJECTIVES- To determine morbidity and to analyze and classify the basal cell carcinomas diag-nosed in the city of Blumenau, from 1980 to 1999, according to their major clinical and his-tological features. METHODS- The author reviewed the histopathological findings of two laboratories of the city of Blumenau, considering the variables sex, age, primary site and histological type. The mor-bidity rates were calculated using the number of basal cell carcinomas found and the annual population estimated from 1980 to 1999.
