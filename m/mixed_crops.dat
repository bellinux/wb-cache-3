Treatments including five sole cultures of conventional wheat cultivars viz: Pishtaz (P), Falat (F), Shiraz (S), Qods (Q) and Toss (T), <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> of (F+P), <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> of (F+P+S), <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> of (F+S+T+Q) and <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> of (P+F+S+T+Q) with equal ratio of each cultivar. Traits under study were including grain and biological yield, yield components, harvest index, plant height, ear length and Land equivalent ratio for grain and biological yield of wheat.

The DM yield of S. splendida in <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> with C. pubescens increased 43. 4 % and in <b>mix</b> <b>cropping</b> with C. ternatea increased 15. 7 % compared to sole S. splendida. The value of land equivalent ratio of SS/CP (LERSS/CP) was > 1. The LERSS/CT value was 1. The competition ratio (CR) values of S. splendida in both <b>mix</b> <b>cropping</b> were > 1. The agressivity (A) values of S. splendida in both <b>mix</b> <b>cropping</b> were positive. The crude protein, NDF and ADF content of forage were not affected by <b>mix</b> <b>cropping</b> system.

25|$|As {{the western}} reaches of Virginia were {{developed}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century, the vast differences in the agricultural basis, cultural, and transportation needs of the area became a major issue for the Virginia General Assembly. In the older, eastern portion, slavery contributed to the economy. While planters were moving away from labor-intensive tobacco to <b>mixed</b> <b>crops,</b> they still held numerous slaves and their leasing out or sales was also part of their economic prospect. Slavery had become an economic institution upon which planters depended. Watersheds on most of this area eventually drained to the Atlantic Ocean. In the western reaches, families farmed smaller homesteads, mostly without enslaved or hired labor. Settlers were expanding the exploitation of resources: mining of minerals and harvesting of timber. The land drained into the Ohio River Valley, and trade followed the rivers.|$|E

The dry matter (DM) yield of B. decumbens was significantly (P 1. The aggressivity (A) value of B. decumbens in both <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> was positive. The crude protein (CP) content of B. decumbens did not significantly (P> 0. 05) increased by <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> with legumes.

Meanwhile neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) content of B. decumbens did not decrease by intercropping with C. pubescens and C. ternatea. In conclusion, <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> with C. pubescens and C. ternatea in peatland increased DM yield of B. decumbens. <b>Mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> with B. decumbens did not influence DM yield of C. pubescens and decreased DM yield and CP content of C [...] ternatea. <b>Mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> of B. decumbens with C. pubescens and B. decumbens with C [...] ternatea in peatland did not increase total DM yield of forage per unit area of land and nutrition contents of forage.
