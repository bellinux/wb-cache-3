5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a <b>mind.</b> <b>Could</b> they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
5|$|In his {{commentary}} on the ancient Confucian philosopher Mencius (372–289 BC), Shen wrote {{of the importance of}} choosing to follow what one knew to be a true path, yet the heart and <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> not attain full knowledge of truth through mere sensory experience. In his own unique way but using terms influenced by the ideas of Mencius, Shen wrote of an autonomous inner authority that formed the basis for one's inclination towards moral choices, a concept linked to Shen's life experiences of surviving and obtaining success through self-reliance. Along with his {{commentary on}} the Chinese classic texts, Shen Kuo also wrote extensively on the topics of supernatural divination and Buddhist meditation.|$|E
25|$|Mind {{uploading}} may {{potentially be}} accomplished by either of two methods: Copy-and-Transfer or gradual replacement of neurons. In {{the case of the}} former method, mind uploading would be achieved by scanning and mapping the salient features of a biological brain, and then by copying, transferring, and storing that information state into a computer system or another computational device. The simulated <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> be within a virtual reality or simulated world, supported by an anatomic 3D body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> reside in a computer that is inside (or connected to) a (not necessarily humanoid) robot or a biological body in real life.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} arguments (and {{the intuitive}} {{interpretations of the}} arguments above) do not directly explain how a Chinese speaking <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> exist in Searle's room, or how the symbols he manipulates could become meaningful. However, by raising doubts about Searle's intuitions they support other positions, such as the system and robot replies. These arguments, if accepted, prevent Searle from claiming that his conclusion is obvious by undermining the intuitions that his certainty requires.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{saw that}} the <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> not {{function}} as an empty container that simply receives data from outside. Something must be giving order to the incoming data. Images of external objects must be kept in the same sequence {{in which they were}} received. This ordering occurs through the mind's intuition of time. The same considerations apply to the mind's function of constituting space for ordering mappings of visual and tactile signals arriving via the already described chains of physical causation.|$|E
25|$|This {{historic}} intuition {{is therefore}} mathematical intuition. For Poincaré, it {{is a result}} of the principle of least effort, that is, of a link to scientific convention based on experimentation. Convention, thus given a context, permits one to consider different theories of the same problem, and subsequently make a choice based on the degree of simplicity and usefulness of explanations advanced by each of these theories (see also Occam's razor). The example chosen by Poincaré is that of three-dimensional space. He shows how the representation of this space is only one possibility, chosen for its usefulness among many models that the <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> create. His demonstration rests on the theory of The Mathematical Continuum (1893), one of Poincaré's earlier publications.|$|E

25|$|During the 18th century, writing {{shifted from}} the Puritanism of Winthrop and Bradford to Enlightenment ideas of reason. The belief that human and natural occurrences were {{messages}} from God no longer fit with the new human-centered world. Many intellectuals believed that the human <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> comprehend the universe through {{the laws of physics}} as described by Isaac Newton. One of these was Cotton Mather. The first book published in North America that promoted Newton and natural theology was Mather's The Christian Philosopher (1721). The enormous scientific, economic, social, and philosophical, changes of the 18th century, called the Enlightenment, impacted the authority of clergyman and scripture, making way for democratic principles. The increase in population helped account for the greater diversity of opinion in religious and political life as seen in the literature of this time. In 1670, the population of the colonies numbered approximately 111,000. Thirty years later it was more than 250,000. By 1760, it reached 1,600,000. The growth of communities and therefore social life led people to become more interested in the progress of individuals and their shared experience in the colonies. These new ideas {{can be seen in the}} popularity of Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, {{the renowned}} 20th century Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, who {{admitted}} Poe {{as a strong}} influence, praised the novel as [...] "Poe's greatest work". H. G. Wells noted that [...] "Pym tells what a very intelligent <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> imagine about the south polar region a century ago". Even so, most scholars did not engage in much serious discussion or analysis of the novel until the 1950s, though many in France recognized the work much earlier. In 2013, The Guardian cited The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket {{as one of the}} greatest novels ever written in English, and noted its influence on later authors such as Henry James, Arthur Conan Doyle, B. Traven, and David Morrell.|$|E

And if I catch you and my son again in any public {{restaurant}} I will thrash you" [...] to which Wilde responded: [...] "I don't know what the Queensberry rules are, but the Oscar Wilde rule is to shoot on sight". His account in De Profundis was less triumphant: [...] "It was when, in my library at Tite Street, waving his small hands in the air in epileptic fury, your father... stood uttering every foul word his foul <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> think of, and screaming the loathsome threats he afterwards with such cunning carried out". Queensberry only described the scene once, saying Wilde had [...] "shown him the white feather", meaning he had acted in a cowardly way. Though trying to remain calm, Wilde saw that he was becoming ensnared in a brutal family quarrel. He did not wish to bear Queensberry's insults, but he knew to confront him could lead to disaster were his liaisons disclosed publicly.|$|E

500|$|Poe's early detective fiction tales {{featuring}} C. Auguste Dupin {{laid the}} groundwork for future detectives in literature. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, [...] "Each [...] is a root from which a whole literature has developed.... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?" [...] The Mystery Writers of America have named their awards for excellence in the genre the [...] "Edgars". Poe's work also influenced science fiction, notably Jules Verne, who wrote a sequel to Poe's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket called An Antarctic Mystery, also known as The Sphinx of the Ice Fields. Science fiction author H. G. Wells noted, [...] "Pym tells what a very intelligent <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> imagine about the south polar region a century ago." [...] In 2013, The Guardian cited The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket {{as one of the greatest}} novels ever written in the English language, and noted its influence on later authors such as Henry James, Arthur Conan Doyle, B.

500|$|The Liberal Temper {{makes the}} {{argument}} for the division between Plato and early Greek philosophy without a fully realised account of Havelock's theory of Greek literacy, which he was still developing throughout this period. Rather than attempting once again to explain his distinction between 5th- and 4th-century BC thought {{in terms of a}} dissection of the earlier school, Havelock turned, in his 1963 Preface to Plato, to 4th-century BC philosophy itself. He was interested principally in Plato's much debated rejection of poetry in the Republic, in which his fictionalised Socrates argues that poetic mimesis—the representation of life in art—is bad for the soul. Havelock's claim was that the Republic can be used to understand the position of poetry in the [...] "history of the Greek mind." [...] The book is divided into two parts, the first an exploration of oral culture (and what Havelock thinks of as oral thought), and the second an argument for what Havelock calls [...] "The Necessity of Platonism" [...] (the title of Part 2): the intimate relationship between Platonic thought and the development of literacy. Instead of concentrating on the philosophical definitions of key terms, as he had in his book on Democritus, Havelock turned to the Greek language itself, arguing that the meaning of words changed after the full development of written literature to admit a self-reflective subject; even pronouns, he said, had different functions. The result was a universal shift in what the Greek <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> imagine: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Maturidi school, {{the second}} largest school of Sunni theology, posits the {{existence}} of a form of natural law. Abu Mansur al-Maturidi stated that the human <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> know of the existence of God and the major forms of 'good' and 'evil' without the help of revelation. Al-Maturidi gives the example of stealing, which is known to be evil by reason alone due to man's working hard for his property. Killing, fornication, and (for certain Muslims) drinking alcohol were all 'evils' the human <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> know of according to al-Maturidi. The concept of Istislah in Islamic law bears some similarities to the natural law tradition in the West, as exemplified by Thomas Aquinas. However, whereas natural law deems good what is self-evidently good, according as it tends towards the fulfilment of the person, istislah calls good whatever is connected to one of five [...] "basic goods". Al-Ghazali abstracted these [...] "basic goods" [...] from the legal precepts in the Qur'an and Sunnah: they are religion, life, reason, lineage and property. Some add also [...] "honour". Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya also posited that human reason could discern between 'great sins' and good deeds.|$|E
2500|$|Substantial {{similarity}} is {{a question}} of fact that is decided by a jury. In situations where [...] "reasonable <b>minds</b> <b>could</b> not differ" [...] in the opinion that substantial similarity of expression does not exist, a court may make summary judgment for the defendant, closing a case without finding infringement. Since [...] "substantial similarity" [...] can require careful evaluation, however, infringement cases usually lead to full inquiry with appropriate tests developed by the courts.|$|R

5|$|The 13th century saw popular {{outbursts of}} ecstatic piety {{in support of}} the Crusades such as that {{resulting}} in the Children's Crusade in 1212. Large groups of young adults and children spontaneously gathered, believing their innocence would enable success where their elders had failed. Few, if any at all, journeyed to the Eastern Mediterranean. Though little reliable evidence survives for these events, they provide an indication of how hearts and <b>minds</b> <b>could</b> be engaged for the cause.|$|R
2500|$|Canadians in the 19th century came {{to believe}} {{themselves}} possessed of a unique [...] "northern character," [...] due to the long, harsh winters that only those of hardy body and <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> survive. This hardiness was claimed as a Canadian trait, and such sports as ice hockey and snowshoeing that reflected this were asserted as characteristically Canadian. Outside the sports arena Canadians express the national characteristics of being peaceful, orderly and polite. Inside they scream their lungs out at ice hockey games, cheering the speed, ferocity, and violence, making hockey an ambiguous symbol of Canada.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rights of}} {{individual}} beneficiaries under a discretionary trust being uncertain, {{it was open}} to question {{to what extent the}} beneficiaries of a discretionary trust (if all of adult age and sound <b>mind)</b> <b>could</b> utilise the rule in Saunders v Vautier. It had been held that beneficiaries under a discretionary trust could do so, although that authority was decided pre-McPhail v Doulton, where to be valid the trustees {{had to be able to}} draw up a [...] "complete list" [...] of beneficiaries. That notwithstanding, leading commentators have suggested that provided all of the beneficiaries could be ascertained, they should still retain the right to terminate the trust under the rule, so long as it is an exhaustive discretionary trust.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is a close}} {{literary}} {{relationship between}} the Colossians and Ephesians. Over forty passages in Ephesians are expansions or variations of passages in Colossians. E. F. Scott argued that Paul used one letter {{as a model for}} the other, whereas others have considered Ephesians to be derivative of Colossians, edited and reworked by another. Donald Guthrie summarized the implications of this: [...] "Advocates of non-Pauline authorship find it difficult to conceive that one <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> have produced two works possessing so remarkable a degree of similarity in theme and phraseology and yet differing in so many other respects, whereas advocates of Pauline authorship are equally emphatic that two minds could not have produced two such works with so much subtle interdependence blended with independence." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rajneesh {{viewed the}} mind first and {{foremost}} as a mechanism for survival, replicating behavioural strategies that have proven successful in the past. But the mind's appeal to the past, he said, deprives human beings {{of the ability to}} live authentically in the present, causing them to repress genuine emotions and to shut themselves off from joyful experiences that arise naturally when embracing the present moment: [...] "The mind has no inherent capacity for joy. … It only thinks about joy." [...] The result is that people poison themselves with all manner of neuroses, jealousies, and insecurities. He argued that psychological repression, often advocated by religious leaders, makes suppressed feelings re-emerge in another guise, and that sexual repression resulted in societies obsessed with sex. Instead of suppressing, people should trust and accept themselves unconditionally. This should not merely be understood intellectually, as the <b>mind</b> <b>could</b> only assimilate it as one more piece of information: instead meditation was needed.|$|E

50|$|An intense {{interest}} in spiritualism, parapsychology and hypnosis continued throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{running in parallel}} with John Locke's views {{that there was an}} association of ideas requiring the coexistence of feelings with awareness of the feelings. Hypnosis, which was pioneered in the late 18th century by Franz Mesmer and Armand-Marie Jacques de Chastenet, Marques de Puységur, challenged Locke's association of ideas.
