5|$|In Manitoba, a {{city is a}} type {{of urban}} municipality. The Municipal Act {{stipulates}} that an urban municipality can only be named a city if it has a <b>minimum</b> <b>population</b> of 7,500 residents.|$|E
5|$|In Manitoba, {{an urban}} {{municipality}} may be named a town upon formation. Other than the requirements to incorporate as an urban municipality (1,000 residents and 400 people/km2), the Municipal Act has no <b>minimum</b> <b>population</b> threshold {{to limit the}} naming of them as towns. A town can alternately be named a village or urban municipality under the Municipal Act or a city {{if it has a}} <b>minimum</b> <b>population</b> of 7,500.|$|E
5|$|Genetic testing results {{published}} in 2001 indicated that Namib Desert Horses {{are one of}} the most isolated horse populations in the world, with the second-lowest genetic variation of all horse populations that have been studied to date. In part, this is due to their small founding population, and generally small modern population, made smaller during periods of drought. Despite the large domesticated breeding population from which the horses originally descended, at least one genetic bottleneck has occurred in the breed's history, resulting in a significant decline in genetic variation over a relatively short period of time. Although an ideal <b>minimum</b> <b>population</b> size for genetic variability would be around 200 horses, the current range cannot support this population given the average rainfall. Estimates for a necessary <b>minimum</b> <b>population</b> to maintain genetic effectiveness range between 100 and 150 animals.|$|E

5|$|State {{law allows}} for the {{incorporation}} of a community as either a city or a town; the only additional requirement to incorporate as a city is a <b>minimum</b> <b>population</b> of 3,000. Cities and towns in Arizona function largely in an identical manner, but cities are provided with additional powers that a town charter does not provide, limited primarily to certain powers regarding the regulation of utilities and construction within the city limits. State law allows adjoining towns to merge and it allows a city to annex a town, {{but it does not}} allow cities to merge. Additionally, a town may change its form of government to a city upon reaching the <b>minimum</b> <b>population</b> of 3,000. There are, however, large communities that have remained incorporated as a town in spite of attaining a large population; Gilbert, with more than 200,000 residents, remains incorporated as a town.|$|E

5|$|East Redmond was {{a town in}} King County, Washington {{that existed}} from 1956 to 1965. The town, then located {{to the east of}} Redmond in the Seattle {{metropolitan}} area, was formed {{as a result of a}} land use dispute between neighbors. East Redmond, with a population of fewer than 400 people, was found to have not met the state's <b>minimum</b> <b>population</b> requirement for incorporation and was dis-incorporated by a decision of the Washington Supreme Court in 1965.|$|E
5|$|In 1820–21, {{the federal}} land surveys {{had reached the}} disputed area from two directions, {{progressing}} southward from a baseline in Michigan and northward from one in Ohio. For unknown reasons, Surveyor General Tiffin ordered the two surveys to close on the Northwest Ordinance (Fulton) line, rather than Harris' line, perhaps lending implicit support to Michigan's claims over Ohio's. Thus, townships that were established north of the line assumed {{they were part of}} Michigan Territory. By the early 1820s, the growing territory reached the <b>minimum</b> <b>population</b> threshold of 60,000 to qualify for statehood. When Michigan sought to hold a state constitutional convention in 1833, Congress rejected the request because of the still-disputed Toledo Strip.|$|E

The locations were recommended by a report commissioned by OTA, using guidelines published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). While another thirteen locations were likely to have similar noise levels as the three sites selected to receive barriers, abatement was not considered at those locations {{because they did not}} meet other criteria, including <b>minimum</b> <b>population</b> density.

5|$|The Municipal Act, 2001 is the {{legislation}} that enables incorporation and stipulates governance of Ontario's municipalities, excluding the City of Toronto, which {{is subject to the}} City of Toronto Act, 2006. The Municipal Act, 2001 provides lower and single-tier municipalities with the authority to incorporate as cities, towns, villages, townships, or generically as municipalities. There are no <b>minimum</b> <b>population</b> thresholds or other requirements for these municipal sub-types. A municipality can change its status to any of these so long as its resulting name is not being used by another municipality. For upper-tier municipalities, the act provides them with the authority to incorporate as counties, regions and district municipalities.|$|E
5|$|The bald eagle's {{natural range}} covers most of North America, {{including}} most of Canada, {{all of the}} continental United States, and northern Mexico. It is the only sea eagle endemic to North America. Occupying varied habitats from the bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran Desert and the eastern deciduous forests of Quebec and New England, northern birds are migratory, while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year. At <b>minimum</b> <b>population,</b> in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, northern and eastern Canada, and Florida. Today, {{they are much more}} common (almost attaining their peak numbers pre-colonization in North America), and nest in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2015 Louisiana Laws Revised Statutes, {{residents}} of any unincorporated area may propose to incorporate as a municipality if the area meets prescribed <b>minimum</b> <b>population</b> thresholds. Municipal corporations are divided based on population into three classes: cities, towns, and villages. Those having five thousand inhabitants or more {{are classified as}} cities; those having less than five thousand but more than one thousand inhabitants are classified as towns; and those having one thousand or fewer inhabitants are classified as villages. The governor may change the classification of the municipality if the board of aldermen requests a change and a census shows that the population has increased or decreased making it eligible for a different classification. Municipalities are granted powers to perform functions required by local governments including the levy and collection of taxes and to assume indebtedness.|$|E
40|$|Difficulties {{often occur}} in {{separating}} closely related dinoflagellate species. In this study, the potential utility of mitochondrial cytochrome b (cob) gene sequence and mRNA editing characteristics {{was assessed using}} Prorocentrum Ehrenberg as a model. The cob sequences and the patterns of their mRNA editing were analyzed for several Prorocentrum taxa. Results revealed little difference in cob sequence and mRNA editing characteristics between geographic <b>populations</b> of P. <b>minimum</b> (Pavillard) Schiller, while a notable difference was detected between different species (P. minimum and P. micans Ehrenberg). Furthermore, these P. <b>minimum</b> <b>populations</b> consistently formed a tight cluster on phylogenetic trees inferred from cob sequences as well as mRNA editing characteristics, whereas different Prorocentrum species were well separated, with a genetic distance of 0. 0042 +/- 0. 0024 for the former and 0. 0141 +/- 0. 0012 for the latter (P < 0. 01; two-tailed t-test). When the analysis {{was applied to the}} case of P. donghaiense Lu et Goebel and CCMP 1517 strain of P. dentatum Stein, no differences were detected between these two taxa with respect to cob mRNA editing pattern and only small differences equivalent to those between P. <b>minimum</b> <b>populations</b> were detected in terms of cob sequence. On the cob sequence- and editing-based phylogenetic trees, P. donghaiense and P. dentatum CCMP 1517 consistently clustered together at a position sister to P. minimum. The results suggest that cob, combined with its mRNA editing, can potentially be a useful delineator of Prorocentrum species, and that P. donghaiense and P. dentatum CCMP 1517 are most likely the same species and both are closely related to P. minimum...|$|R
50|$|Estimates of the <b>minimum</b> {{reasonable}} <b>population</b> for {{a generation}} ship vary. Anthropologist John Moore has estimated that, {{even in the absence}} of cryonics or sperm banks, a population capacity of 160 people would allow normal family life (with the average individual having ten potential marriage partners) throughout a 200-year space journey, with little loss of genetic diversity; social engineering can reduce this estimate to 80 people. In 2013 anthropologist Cameron Smith reviewed existing literature and created a new computer model to estimate a <b>minimum</b> reasonable <b>population</b> in the tens of thousands. Smith's numbers were much larger than previous estimates such as Moore's, in part because Smith takes the risk of accidents and disease into consideration, and assumes at least one severe population catastrophe over the course of a 150-year journey.|$|R
40|$|Most {{contingent}} valuation studies focus on total {{willingness to pay}} (WTP) {{as a measure of}} welfare change. For policy involving species preservation, however, it is important to distinguish between the benefits of preventing a species from going extinct and the benefits of preserving numbers above the <b>minimum</b> viable <b>population</b> (MVP) level. Once MVP is exceeded, marginal WTP becomes relevant. These propositions are illustrated for the case of one charismatic species whose management is much debated, minke whales in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. It is shown that, for a given estimate of total preservation value, strict conservation and extinction can both be optimal. This finding highlights the importance of collecting marginal values in {{contingent valuation}} surveys.

5|$|The {{radiocarbon}} dating of the skeletal remains from 56 Beringian wolves showed a continuous population from over 50,800 YBP until 12,500YBP, followed by one wolf dated at 7,600YBP. This indicates that their population was in decline after 12,500YBP, although megafauna was still available {{in this region}} until 10,500YBP. The timing of this latter specimen {{is supported by the}} recovery of mammoth and horse DNA from sediments dated 10,500 YBP–7,600 YBP from the interior of Alaska. The timing for the extinction of horses in North America and the <b>minimum</b> <b>population</b> size for North American bison coincide with the extinction of an entire wolf haplogroup in North America, indicating that the disappearance of their prey caused the extinction of this wolf ecomorph. This resulted in a significant loss of phenotypic and genetic diversity within the species.|$|E
5|$|African {{elephants}} {{were listed}} as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2008, with no independent {{assessment of the}} conservation status of the two forms. In 1979, Africa had an estimated <b>minimum</b> <b>population</b> of 1.3million elephants, with a possible upper limit of 3.0million. By 1989, the population {{was estimated to be}} 609,000; with 277,000 in Central Africa, 110,000 in eastern Africa, 204,000 in southern Africa, and 19,000 in western Africa. About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought. From 1977 to 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in East Africa. After 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated, and savannah populations from Cameroon to Somalia experienced a decline of 80%. African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. Population trends in southern Africa were mixed, with anecdotal reports of losses in Zambia, Mozambique and Angola while populations grew in Botswana and Zimbabwe and were stable in South Africa. Conversely, studies in 2005 and 2007 found populations in eastern and southern Africa were increasing by an average annual rate of 4.0%. Due to the vast areas involved, assessing the total African elephant population remains difficult and involves an element of guesswork. The IUCN estimates a total of around 440,000 individuals for 2012.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities in Rhode Island can {{incorporate}} as a town or city {{by a special}} act of the state legislature {{and there is no}} <b>minimum</b> <b>population</b> requirement. Eight municipalities were reincorporated as cities operating under a charter, while the other thirtyone remain as towns which perform similar services. Since Rhode Island has no county level of government, cities and towns provide services commonly performed by county governments in other states. Rhode Island's cities and towns may adopt one of four different forms of government: councilmanager, mayorcouncil, town counciltown meeting, or administratorcouncil. The primary difference between these forms of government is how the chief executive is selected. The Councilmanager system involves an elected council who exercise overall control of the local government and a chief executive termed city or town manager who is generally appointed by and responsible to the council for the administration of local policies. Councilmanager systems may elect a mayor but they have no formal administrative functions with the potential exception of a degree of veto power. Mayorcouncil systems have a similarly elected council however the mayor is elected and yields administrative power. In the town counciltown meeting system, there is no fulltime chief executive. There are no towns or cities in Rhode Island that use the administratorcouncil form of government.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a two-sector demo-economic model (agricultural and non-agricultural sectors) applied to Europe and spanning {{the period from}} the neolithic agricultural revolution to the Industrial Revolution. The model describes the "incessant contest" between population growth and food production. As long as per capita agricultural output is above a critical <b>minimum,</b> the <b>population</b> is assumed to grow at a constant rate. When this output drops below the <b>minimum,</b> the <b>population</b> is subjected to random mortality "shocks" which lower the population until the production grows above the minimum. Society is thus in a "Malthusian trap". The average magnitude of the mortality crises is assumed to decrease as capital increases, which captures an increased "resistance" that comes with increased knowledge and technology. The slow accumulation of capital thus diminishes {{the severity of the}} mortality shocks; as a result both the population of the non-agricultural sector and capital grow sufficiently to bring about a permanent escape from the Malthusian trap, i. e. the Industrial Revolution. ...|$|R
