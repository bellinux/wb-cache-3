25|$|Valentinian Gnosticism {{may have}} been monistic rather than dualistic. In the Valentinian myths, the {{creation}} of a flawed <b>materiality</b> is not due to any moral failing {{on the part of the}} Demiurge, but due to the fact that he is less perfect than the superior entities from which he emanated. Valentinians treat physical reality with less contempt than other Gnostic groups, and conceive of <b>materiality</b> not as a separate substance from the divine, but as attributable to an error of perception which becomes symbolized mythopoetically as the act of material creation.|$|E
25|$|Materialism {{typically}} {{contrasts with}} dualism, phenomenalism, idealism, vitalism, and dual-aspect monism. Its <b>materiality</b> can, in some ways, {{be linked to}} the concept of determinism, as espoused by Enlightenment thinkers.|$|E
40|$|The author explores <b>materialities</b> as {{pre-established}} and co-producing {{features of}} criminal proceedings. This {{is done by}} discussing courtrooms, files and stories in relation to English Crown Court hearings. The three <b>materialities</b> gain significance {{in the course of}} the court hearing, but do not derive from it. They exceed the course of talk-in-court. Once the hearing started, the pre-established <b>materialities</b> can be referred to but not simply modified. <b>Materialities,</b> in this line, provide stability and guidance for the hearing. They facilitate, purify and condense it. However, their temporal separation causes problems for those who run the show. <b>Materialities</b> can be employed but not fully integrated. Unwelcome parts do, at times, disturb, disrupt and complicate the current dealings...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this special issue is on how {{everyday}} or 'mundane' <b>materialities</b> actively mediate health and care practices. This paper extends this concern with the mundane to care itself and explores how specific <b>materialities,</b> such as shared spaces and everyday objects, not only mediate but enable mundane care to happen. Our focus is on mundane help {{in the context of}} ill-health, between people who are not immediate family, such as neighbours, acquaintances and others we interact with in our daily lives. Drawing on recent empirical studies of low level support in two different parts of the UK, we show how <b>materialities</b> of care can mediate the affective risks associated with receiving such help. Specifically, we investigate how <b>materialities</b> help people to balance the expression of vulnerability with a need to retain their dignity, a practice Arthur W. Frank (2010) refers to as 'holding one's own'. In doing so, we argue that <b>materialities</b> are not just the conduits for care – what care passes through- or things that mediate care. We suggest instead that <b>materialities</b> are part of how relationships of mundane care are constituted and maintained...|$|R

25|$|However, {{with the}} {{evolving}} {{shift in the}} economy towards an informational <b>materiality,</b> in which value {{is based upon the}} informational significance, or the narratives surrounding the products, the clear-cut subjective separation is no longer obvious. Hardt and Negri see the open source approaches as examples of new ways of co-operation that illustrate how economic value is not founded upon exclusive possession, but rather upon collective potentialities. Informational <b>materiality</b> is characterized by gaining value only through being shared. Hardt and Negri thus suggest that the commons become the focal point of analyses of public relations. The point being that with this shift it becomes possible to analyse how the very distinctions between the private and public are evolving.|$|E

40|$|<b>Materialities</b> and Mobilities in Education {{develops}} new {{arguments about}} the ways in which educational processes can be analysed. Drawing on a recent interest in mobilities across the social sciences, and a conterminous resurgence in academic accounts of <b>materialities,</b> the book demonstrates how these two ostensibly differing perspectives on education might be fruitfully deployed in tandem. Considering the interaction and convergence of <b>materialities</b> and mobilities, the book highlights the relationship between structural constraints and opportunities and the agency of individuals, providing a unique and essential insight into contemporary education. Examining a range of education spaces from the formal to the informal and the different types of mobility that manifest in relation to education, the book introduces readers to a range of theoretical resources and detailed case studies used to analyse the spatiality of education from across the disciplines of human geography, education and sociology. Drawing on material from across the globe, <b>Materialities</b> and Mobilities in Education is an engaging and relevant text, which will appeal to postgraduate students, researchers and academics interested in the development of education policy and practice...|$|R

25|$|The demiurge {{creates the}} {{physical}} universe {{and the physical}} aspect of humanity. The demiurge typically creates a group of co-actors named archons who preside over the material realm and, in some cases, present obstacles to the soul seeking ascent from it.

In other cases it takes on a more ascetic tendency to view material existence negatively, which then becomes more extreme when <b>materiality,</b> including the human body, is perceived as evil and constrictive, a deliberate prison for its inhabitants.|$|E

25|$|Horn {{explores the}} mutable nature {{of art and}} {{identity}} through sculptures, works on paper, photography, and books. She describes drawing as the key activity in all her work because drawing is about composing relationships. Horn’s drawings concentrate on the <b>materiality</b> of the objects depicted. She also uses words {{as the basis for}} drawings and other works. Horn crafts complex relationships between the viewer and her work by installing a single piece on opposing walls, in adjoining rooms, or throughout a series of buildings. She subverts the notion of ‘identical experience’, insisting that one’s sense of self is marked by a place in the here-and-there, and by time in the now-and-then. She describes her artworks as site-dependent, expanding upon the idea of site-specificity associated with Minimalism. Horn’s work also embodies the cyclical relationship between humankind and nature—a mirror-like relationship in which we attempt to remake nature in our own image.|$|E

40|$|From food punnets {{to credit}} cards, plastic {{facilitates}} {{every part of}} our daily lives. It has become central to processes of contemporary socio-material living. Universalised and abstracted, it is often treated as the passive object of political deliberations, or a problematic material demanding human management. But in what ways might a 'politics of plastics' deal with both its specific manifestation in particular artefacts and events, and its complex dispersed heterogeneity? Accumulation explores the vitality and complexity of plastic. This interdisciplinary collection focuses on how the presence and recalcitrance of plastic reveals the relational exchanges across human and synthetic <b>materialities.</b> It captures multiplicity by engaging with the processual <b>materialities</b> or plasticity of plastic. Through a series of themed essays on plastic <b>materialities,</b> plastic economies, plastic bodies and new articulations of plastic, the editors and chapter authors examine specific aspects of plastic in action. How are multiple plastic realities enacted? What are their effects...|$|R
25|$|Statements of fact in a {{contract}} or in obtaining the contract {{are considered to}} be either warranties or representations. Traditionally, warranties are factual promises which are enforced through {{a contract}} legal action, regardless of <b>materiality,</b> intent, or reliance. Representations are traditionally precontractual statements which allow for a tort-based action (such as the tort of deceit) if the misrepresentation is negligent or fraudulent; historically a tort was the only action available, but by 1778, breach of warranty became a separate legal contractual action. In U.S. law, the distinction between the two is somewhat unclear; warranties are viewed as primarily contract-based legal action while negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations are tort-based, but there is a confusing mix of case law in the United States. In modern English law, sellers often avoid using the term 'represents' in order to avoid claims under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, while in America 'warrants and represents' is relatively common. Some modern commentators suggest avoiding the words and substituting 'state' or 'agree', and some model forms do not use the words; however, others disagree.|$|E
25|$|Nelson's work {{revolves}} around a personal language of symbols and archetypes. The {{subjects of the}} paintings change from piece to piece and from project to project but {{the core of the}} work stems from his own personal lexicon of archetypal symbols. Nelson's work from 2000-2010 touches on Chicago Imagism, Funk Art, and outsider art, emphasizing simplified images. The works are rich in <b>materiality.</b> Surfaces are thick with densely saturated pigments and heavily worked with layers of drawing...even the drawings have dimension, with the paper lifting off its backing. As Kathryn M. Davis writes in ArtNews, Nelson’s “sly paintings conjure cartoons, found signage, and modern hieroglyphs, and tie them together with lusciously patinated surfaces. Nelson describes his own process: “The unconscious is like a reservoir. Themes emerge, some that are humorous, others that are cryptic and vague.” His work presents an idiosyncratic slant on the human figure and a psychological take on human nature. Though not wholly human the beings in Nelson's artwork reflect the shifting role of the subconscious self, part animal and part human, part nature and part culture.|$|E
25|$|Semiotic {{art history}} seeks {{to uncover the}} codified meaning or {{meanings}} in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a collective consciousness. Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, Meyer Schapiro borrowed Saussure’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system. According to Schapiro, to {{understand the meaning of}} frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a , or a three-quarter view. Schapiro combined this method with the work of Charles Sanders Peirce whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the Mona Lisa. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its <b>materiality</b> is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to Leonardo da Vinci? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations {{as much as it is}} to reveal new possibilities.|$|E

500|$|Antoinist {{doctrine}} provides another interpretation to {{the original}} sin {{in the book of}} Genesis: Adam began to follow Eve, who had placed her confidence in a serpent, symbol of matter.

The [...] "tree of knowledge of good and evil" [...] in the Bible is redefined as [...] "the tree of the science of the sight of evil". Antoinism claimed to not be an atheist religion, but has a particular conception of God: this one does not exist outside of humans, and they do not exist outside of God.
