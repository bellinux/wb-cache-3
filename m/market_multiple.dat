50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Exit Multiple {{approach}} {{must be used}} carefully, because multiples change over time. Simply applying the current <b>market</b> <b>multiple</b> ignores the possibility that current multiples may be high or low by historical standards.

When using the Exit Multiple approach it is often helpful to calculate the implied terminal growth rate, because a multiple that may appear reasonable at first glance can actually imply a terminal growth rate that is unrealistic.|$|E

40|$|Transaction <b>market</b> <b>multiples</b> {{are widely}} used as {{benchmarks}} for negotiation between buyers and sellers. This research focuses on financial performance expressed as transaction <b>market</b> <b>multiples</b> of sales, EBITDA and net profit for the 2002 - 2009 period. The number of transactions declined much more in 2002 than in 2008 and 2009, but the value of transactions displayed the opposite trend. The 2008 - 2009 economic crisis impacted the valuation of food companies more than the 2002 crisis. <b>Market</b> <b>multiples</b> declined much more in 2009 than in 2002 and 2003. On average, transaction multiples are stable, even though their values on a given year are affected by economic cycles. The EV/EBITDA provides results with smaller spread than EV/ Sales and EV/net profit. The present research shows that valuations of dairy companies are quite close to the average valuations in the food business. But valuations of wines and spirits companies are a lot higher than other food business companies.

This result and qualitative data indicate answers to census questions could lead to under-reporting of some rural occupations "hidden" as second jobs.

The equilibrium conditions of the market are formulated and analyzed, and the existence of an equilibrium is proved. Computational results and comparisons between the competitive equilibrium and Nash equilibrium solutions are also presented, which show that the competitive market equilibrium solution often provides more efficient power distribution.|$|E
