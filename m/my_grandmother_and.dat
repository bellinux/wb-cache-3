I think {{he did not like}} me. I ran to <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> <b>and</b> she protected me. Kuakini saw me and said to my grandmother to let the haole go and told us to [...] "hakaka" [...] (fight). She did and we fought. I beat him. Kuakini made fun of Kinau who was about six years old then.|$|E
500|$|After {{being named}} Most Valuable Player (MVP) {{at the prestigious}} Boston Shootout and {{acknowledged}} as the leading participant at the Nike camp, Howard was mentioned as the best prospect in the country. By this time, he had dropped Michigan State and Illinois from his list of possible college destinations and had begun considering UNLV as well. Following his time at the Nike camp, his household was besieged by recruiters. Howard issued the following statement: [...] "Contact my coach. I do not want <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> <b>and</b> aunt upset about calls at all {{times of the day}} and night. I'm not the only person who lives in this house. I think my wishes should be respected. If not, {{when it comes time to}} make my decision, I'll take those things into account." [...] Although Howard was the best performer at the camp, talent scout Bob Gibbons felt Webber and Robinson were equally talented prospects. [...] Despite Howard's most recently listed college preferences and the fact that the team was under investigation for recruiting violations, Illinois continued pursuing Howard as its number one recruit. [...] By the end of July 1990, Howard was projected to sign with Michigan.|$|E

What the crime was she could not remember, but it had happened about fifteen years ago.|$|E

60|$|<b>My</b> <b>grandmother</b> <b>and</b> Walkirk were greatly concerned, {{as well as}} surprised, at what I had done.

When I returned, the iron grating was in its place. It was a neat and artistic piece of work, but I did not like it. I object decidedly to anything which suggests restraint. The whole affair of the secretary was indeed very different from what I would have had it, but I had discovered that even in our advanced era of civilization one cannot always have everything he wants, albeit he be perfectly able and willing to pay for it.|$|E
60|$|Everything being thus explained, and {{our dinner}} ended, all parties {{proceeded}} to {{the execution of}} the plan, each in his or her designated mode.

Martha had retired to the inner room for a moment, whither my grandmother, suspecting the truth, followed her. As I afterward ascertained, my sister, fearful {{of not being able to}} suppress her tears on my entrance, had withdrawn, in order to struggle for self-command without betraying our secret. I was told to commence an air, without waiting for the absent young lady, as the strain could easily be heard through the open door.|$|E
