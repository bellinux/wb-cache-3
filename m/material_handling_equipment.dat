25|$|Taylor {{rejected}} the notion, which was universal {{in his day}} and still held today, that the trades, including manufacturing, were resistant to analysis and could only be performed by craft production methods. In {{the course of his}} empirical studies, Taylor examined various kinds of manual labor. For example, most bulk materials handling was manual at the time; <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> {{as we know it today}} was mostly not developed yet. He looked at shoveling in the unloading of railroad cars full of ore; lifting and carrying in the moving of iron pigs at steel mills; the manual inspection of bearing balls; and others. He discovered many concepts that were not widely accepted at the time. For example, by observing workers, he decided that labor should include rest breaks so that the worker has time to recover from fatigue, either physical (as in shoveling or lifting) or mental (as in the ball inspection case). Workers were allowed to take more rests during work, and productivity increased as a result.|$|E
