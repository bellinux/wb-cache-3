Results of correlation analysis showed that life satisfaction was associated both with multiple group memberships prior to stroke and with the <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> group <b>memberships.</b> Path analysis indicated that belonging to multiple groups was associated with maintained well-being because there was a greater likelihood that some <b>of</b> those <b>memberships</b> would be preserved after stroke-related life transition. Furthermore, it was found that cognitive failures compromised well-being in part because they made it hard for individuals to maintain group memberships post-stroke. These findings highlight the importance of social identity continuity in facilitating well-being following stroke and, more broadly, show the theoretical contribution that a social identity approach to mental health can make in the context of neuropsychological rehabilitation...|$|R

Many of these applications use multicast groups with dynamic membership such as multi-media conferencing, multi-media broadcasting and multi-media distributed data bases.

Point-to-multipoint connections may be utilized for efficient implementation of multicast groups.

40|$|The {{closed shop}} {{has been one}} of the most burning labor issues of the last several years. It has thus far defied a {{generally}} satisfactory solution. The National War Labor Board faced the issue many times during the war and devised <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>membership</b> as a temporary solution, which neither labor nor management considered very satisfactory. Fourteen states have recently tried to solve the problem by way of statutes or constitutional amendments prohibiting the closed shop. Unions claim that this action by the states is unconstitutional and are pressing this claim in the courts. The recently enacted Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 attempts to deal with the problem by prohibiting all forms of union-security agreements except the type known as the union shop and by prohibiting certain abuses. Labor claims that the Act has gone too far. In general, employers have described the closed shop as un-American and a violation of the individual worker’s rights. Labor has answered that the closed shop is collective bargaining in its best form. Rarely are the basic issues clarified and analyzed. It is the general purpose of this study to examine the issue in the light of experience and of an analysis of the basic issues involved. To this end we shall first examine the terms used in connection with this issue and clarify the meanings for our purposes. Next, the history of the issue in the United States will be briefly surveyed. The third step will be to evaluate the arguments for and against the closed shop and to determine which way the balance lies. And finally, the proposed solutions to the problems will be evaluated in order to find the one which is based on the results of our analysis. Advisor: Curtis M. Elliot...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} motivational aspects of academic engagement from a social-psychological perspective by introducing the concept <b>of</b> school <b>membership</b> as a mediating factor between academic {{environment and the}} behaviors that comprise academic engagement. School membership is rooted in identity theory and {{is defined as the}} possession of social bonds with a social network of school members through which a highly salient self-identity and high levels of commitment {{as a member of the}} school are internalized. In order to identify links between academic environment, school membership, and academic engagement, I qualitatively examine disadvantaged students within "City High", a school employing the Talent Development High School Model, a comprehensive school reform model with that creates an environment conducive to the internalization <b>of</b> school <b>membership.</b> Using ethnographic methods, I compare and contrast school membership levels and perceptions of in and out of school environment within a diverse group of students at "City High". In order to test my qualitative findings on a broad scale, I quantitatively examine links between academic environment, school membership, and academic engagement through multilevel modeling techniques, using data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002. Both the qualitative and quantitative portions of this dissertation provide suggestive results indicating both the presence <b>of</b> school <b>membership</b> within disadvantaged students with high levels of academic performance and effort. In addition, both phases of this project indicate that students' social and structural academic environment were related to the creation and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> school <b>membership.</b> This dissertation concludes by examining the ways in which comprehensive school reform models benefit by focusing on students who are transitioning to high school and placing the creation of a "culture of success" on par with raising student achievement levels, as these goals are intertwined...|$|R
40|$|In many applications, e. g. {{urban traffic}} monitoring, stock trading, and {{industrial}} sensor data monitoring, clustering algorithms are applied on data streams in real-time to find current patterns. Here, sliding windows {{are commonly used}} as they capture concept drift. Real-time clustering over sliding windows is early detection of continuously evolving clusters {{as soon as they}} occur in the stream, which requires efficient <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> cluster <b>memberships</b> that change as windows slide. Data stream management systems (DSMSs) provide high-level query languages for searching and analyzing streaming data. In this thesis we extend a DSMS with a real-time data stream clustering framework called Generic 2 -phase Continuous Summarization framework (G 2 CS).  G 2 CS modularizes data stream clustering by taking as input clustering algorithms which are expressed in terms of a number of functions and indexing structures. G 2 CS supports real-time clustering by efficient window sliding mechanism and algorithm transparent indexing. A particular challenge for real-time detection of a high number of rapidly evolving clusters is efficiency of window slides for clustering algorithms where deletion of expired data is not supported, e. g. BIRCH. To that end, G 2 CS includes a novel window maintenance mechanism called Sliding Binary Merge (SBM). To further improve real-time sliding performance, G 2 CS uses generation-based multi-dimensional indexing where indexing structures suitable for the clustering algorithms can be plugged-in...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Peace building experience of Rotary Clubs in Northern Uganda between 2006 and 2010, {{so as to}} identify their contributions in post-conflict peace building processes. Through the Reflective Peace Practice (RPP) analytical framework, the paper presents an insight into Rotary clubs’ post-conflict Peace building interventions in the Northern Ugandan districts of Gulu, Kitgum, Lira and Pader. The paper is premised on the theoretical framework of Rotary’s outline of international service that identifies the paths to peace as: patriotism, conciliation, freedom, progress, justice, sacrifice, and loyalty. The paper discusses Rotary clubs’ peace building projects in Northern Uganda as clustered along three generic lines: the improvement of health, alleviation of poverty, and education support. The effectiveness of the “paths to peace” principles was hampered by challenges such as: the eroded core values of the people owing to life in Internally Displaced People’s (IDP) camps, the beneficiary non-ownership of Rotary projects, the difficulty in recruitment and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> Rotary clubs’ <b>membership</b> as well as limited funding.
