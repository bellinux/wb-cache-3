5|$|Smith {{also decided}} to join the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), an occult {{organisation}} whose British branch, the Mysteria Magica Maxima (MMM), was run by Crowley, who used it to promote Thelema. In January 1915, Smith signed up to the MMM, and in April went through the <b>Minerval</b> degree initiation at the British Columbia Lodge No. 1. In May, he {{took part in the}} Lodge's public performance of the Rites of Isis, which it was hoped would attract further members. In a private capacity, he meanwhile continued performing his A∴A∴ practices, and also began experimenting with the entheogenic properties of anhalonium. In October 1915, Crowley visited the Lodge, where he met with Smith. Soon after, Smith would be upgraded to the position of Master Magician within the Lodge, and in March 1916 received the Probationer level in the A∴A∴, adopting as his personal magical motto the Latin words Nubem Eripiam ("I will snatch away the cloud").|$|E
5|$|With the O.T.O. {{now being}} revived in North America, Smith founded the Agape Lodge No. 1, based at his Hollywood home, {{and brought in}} 7 initiates to the <b>Minerval</b> level in September 1935. He advertised the {{foundation}} of his group through an advert in American Astrology magazine and printed a pamphlet explaining what the O.T.O. was. The Agape Lodge held regular meetings, lectures, and study classes, {{as well as social}} events and a weekly Gnostic Mass open to the public. In February 1936 they held a Mass in honour of Wayne Walker, a proponent of New Thought who ran a group known as The Voice of Healing; they had hoped to attract Walker and his supporters to Thelema, but they were put off by the Lodge's sexual openness. Later that year, Smith and Jacobi's employer, the Southern California Gas Company, discovered their involvement in the Lodge, demoting Smith to bookkeeper and firing Jacobi. Angered, Jacobi left the Lodge altogether, while Smith shut down the group's private ritual activities for the next three years. As a result, the public attendance of the Gnostic Mass plummeted.|$|E
25|$|On May Day 1947, Gardner's friend Arnold Crowther {{introduced}} him to Aleister Crowley, the ceremonial magician who had founded the religion of Thelema in 1904. Shortly before his death, Crowley elevated Gardner to the IV° of Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) and issued a charter decreeing that Gardner could admit people into its <b>Minerval</b> degree. The charter itself was written in Gardner's handwriting and only signed by Crowley. From November 1947 to March 1948, Gardner and his wife toured the United States visiting relatives in Memphis, also visiting New Orleans, where Gardner hoped to learn about Voodoo. During his voyage, Crowley had died, {{and as a result}} Gardner considered himself the head of the O.T.O. in Europe, (a position accepted by Lady Frieda Harris). He met Crowley's successor, Karl Germer, in New York though Gardner would soon lose interest in leading the O.T.O., and in 1951 he was replaced by Frederic Mellinger as the O.T.O.'s European representative.|$|E
5000|$|The Prussian Rosicrucians, under Johann Christoph von Wöllner, began a {{sustained}} {{attack on the}} Illuminati. Wöllner had a specially engineered room in which he convinced potential patrons {{of the effectiveness of}} Rosicrucian [...] "magic", and his order had acquired effective control of the [...] "Three Globes" [...] and its attached lodges. Through this mouthpiece, the Illuminati were accused of atheism and revolutionary tendencies. In April 1783 Frederick the Great informed Charles of Hesse that the Berlin lodges had documents belonging to the <b>Minervals</b> or Illuminati which contained appalling material, and asked if he had heard of them. All Berlin masons were now warned against the order, which was now accused of Socinianism, and of using the liberal writings of Voltaire and others, alongside the tolerance of Freemasonry, to undermine all religion. In November 1783 the Three Globes described the Illuminati as a masonic sect which sought to undermine Christianity and turn Freemasonry into a political system. Their final anathema, in November 1784, refused to recognise any Illuminati as Freemasons.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{decline of}} the Illuminati was {{brought about by the}} indiscretions of their own <b>Minervals</b> in Bavaria, and {{especially}} in Munich. In spite of efforts by their superiors to curb loose talk, politically dangerous boasts of power and criticism of monarchy caused the [...] "secret" [...] order's existence to become common knowledge, along with the names of many important members. The presence of Illuminati in positions of power now led to some public disquiet. There were Illuminati in many civic and state governing bodies. In spite of their small number, there were claims that success in a legal dispute depended on the litigant's standing with the order. The Illuminati were blamed for several anti-religious publications then appearing in Bavaria. Much of this criticism sprang from vindictiveness and jealousy, {{but it is clear that}} many Illuminati court officials gave preferential treatment to their brethren. In Bavaria, the energy of their two members of the Ecclesiastical Council had one of them elected treasurer. Their opposition to Jesuits resulted in the banned order losing key academic and church positions. In Ingolstat, the Jesuit heads of department were replaced by Illuminati.|$|R
50|$|During {{this early}} period, the order had three grades of Novice, <b>Minerval,</b> and Illuminated <b>Minerval,</b> of which only the <b>Minerval</b> grade {{involved}} a complicated ceremony. In this the candidate was given secret signs and a password. A system of mutual espionage kept Weishaupt {{informed of the}} activities and character of all his members, his favourites becoming members of the ruling council, or Areopagus. Some novices were permitted to recruit, becoming Insinuants. Christians of good character were actively sought, with Jews and pagans specifically excluded, along with women, monks, and members of other secret societies. Favoured candidates were rich, docile, willing to learn, and aged 18-30.|$|E

50|$|According to John Robison's Proofs of a Conspiracy (1798), {{the third}} degree of the Bavarian Illuminati was called <b>Minerval</b> or Brother of Minerva, {{in honour of}} the goddess of learning. Later, this title was adopted for the first {{initiation}} of Aleister Crowley's OTO rituals.|$|E
50|$|Françoise Gravier, a French national, {{applied in}} 1982 to study cartoon drawing at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in the Belgian city of Liège. Gravier was {{requested}} {{to pay a}} fee of 24,622 Belgian francs (approximately 610 euros) as a <b>Minerval</b> (enrolment fee) which was only demanded from foreign students. After refusing to meet the fee, Gravier {{was rejected by the}} Académie and her Belgian study visa was revoked.|$|E

I accordingly constructed a series of rituals, <b>Minerval,</b> Man, Magician, Master-Magician, Perfect Magician and Perfect Initiate, which should illustrate the course of human life in its largest philosophical aspect.|$|E
50|$|He {{lived in}} various parts of Oklahoma and the Midwest, and {{graduated}} from high school in Valley Center, Kansas in 1937. He then moved to Southern California to study engineering at Pasadena Junior College, where he made friends with some students at the nearby California Institute of Technology. Among them was Jack Parsons, who shared his enthusiasm for science fiction, and who introduced him to Thelema. In 1941 McMurtry was initiated into the <b>Minerval</b> and I° of Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), a secret society headed at the time by Aleister Crowley.|$|E
5000|$|Breeze {{has been}} {{involved}} in the occult since the 1970s. He was involved in the publishing of Aleister Crowley's Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on The Book of the Law (edited by John Symonds and Kenneth Grant; 93 Publishing, 1974) and was a student of Marcelo Ramos Motta, who described him as [...] "an ex-Probationer who failed to keep his Oath and perform his Task and was cut contact with as a result." [...] In 1978, Breeze was initiated into the <b>Minerval</b> degree of Ordo Templi Orientis. During the next few years, he advanced through the Man of Earth degrees of O.T.O., taking his IV° & P.I. at Tahuti Lodge in New York City in January 1985.|$|E

5000|$|Weishaupt set Knigge {{the task}} of {{recruiting}} before he could be admitted to the higher grades of the order. Knigge accepted, {{on the condition that}} he be allowed to choose his own recruiting grounds. Many other masons found Knigge's description of the new masonic order attractive, and were enrolled in the <b>Minerval</b> grade of the Illuminati. Knigge appeared at this time to believe in the [...] "Most Serene Superiors" [...] which Weishaupt claimed to serve. His inability to articulate anything about the higher degrees of the order became increasingly embarrassing, but in delaying any help, Weishaupt gave him an extra task. Provided with material by Weishaupt, Knigge now produced pamphlets outlining the activities of the outlawed Jesuits, purporting to show how they continued to thrive and recruit, especially in Bavaria. Meanwhile, Knigge's inability to give his recruits any satisfactory response to questions regarding the higher grades was making his position untenable, and he wrote to Weishaupt to this effect. In January 1781, {{faced with the prospect of}} losing Knigge and his masonic recruits, Weishaupt finally confessed that his superiors and the supposed antiquity of the order were fictions, and the higher degrees had yet to be written.|$|E
50|$|In {{discussions with}} the Areopagus and Weishaupt, Knigge {{identified}} two areas which were problematic. Weishaupt's emphasis on the recruitment of university students meant that senior positions in the order often had to be filled by young men with little practical experience. Secondly, the anti-Jesuit ethos of the order at its inception had become a general anti-religious sentiment, which Knigge knew {{would be a problem}} in recruiting the senior Freemasons that the order now sought to attract. Knigge felt keenly the stifling grip of conservative Catholicism in Bavaria, and understood the anti-religious feelings that this produced in the liberal Illuminati, but he also saw the negative impression these same feelings would engender in Protestant states, inhibiting the spread of the order in greater Germany. Both the Areopagus and Weishaupt felt powerless to do anything less than give Knigge a free hand. He had the contacts within and outside of Freemasonry that they needed, and he had the skill as a ritualist to build their projected gradal structure, where they had ground to a halt at Illuminatus Minor, with only the <b>Minerval</b> grade below and the merest sketches of higher grades. The only restrictions imposed were the need to discuss the inner secrets of the highest grades, and the necessity of submitting his new grades for approval.|$|E
5000|$|Knigge was {{recruited}} late in 1780 at {{a convention of}} the Rite of Strict Observance by Costanzo Marchese di Costanzo, an infantry captain in the Bavarian army and a fellow Freemason. Knigge, still in his twenties, had already reached the highest initiatory grades of his order, and had arrived with his own grand plans for its reform. Disappointed that his scheme found no support, Knigge was immediately intrigued when Costanzo informed him that the order that he sought to create already existed. Knigge and three of his friends expressed {{a strong interest in}} learning more of this order, and Costanzo showed them material relating to the <b>Minerval</b> grade. The teaching material for the grade was [...] "liberal" [...] literature which was banned in Bavaria, but common knowledge in the Protestant German states. Knigge's three companions became disillusioned and had no more to do with Costanzo, but Knigge's persistence was rewarded in November 1780 by a letter from Weishaupt. Knigge's connections, both within and outside of Freemasonry, made him an ideal recruit. Knigge, for his own part, was flattered by the attention, and drawn towards the order's stated aims of education and the protection of mankind from despotism. Weishaupt managed to acknowledge, and pledge to support, Knigge's interest in alchemy and the [...] "higher sciences". Knigge replied to Weishaupt outlining his plans for the reform of Freemasonry as the Strict Observance began to question its own origins.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis review {{summarizes}} the cellular bases {{of the effects}} of NaCHOleate (2 -hydroxyoleic acid; 2 OHOA; <b>Minerval)</b> against glioma and other types of tumors. NaCHOleate, activates sphingomyelin synthase (SGMS) increasing the levels of cell membrane sphingomyelin (SM) and diacylglycerol (DAG) together with reductions of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC). The increases in the membrane levels of NaCHOleate itself and of DAG induce a translocation and overexpression of protein kinase C (PKC) and subsequent reductions of Cyclin D, cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDKs 4 and 6), hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, inhibition of E 2 F 1 and knockdown of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) impairing DNA synthesis. In addition in some cancer cells, the increases in SM are associated with Fas receptor (FasR) capping and ligand-free induction of apoptosis. In glioma cell lines, the increases in SM are associated with the inhibition of the Ras/MAPK and PI 3 K/Akt pathways, in association with p 27 Kip 1 overexpression. Finally, an analysis of the Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) database for glioma patient survival shows that the weight of SM-related metabolism gene expression in glioma patients' survival is similar to glioma-related genes. Due to its low toxicity and anti-tumoral effect in cell and animal models its status as an orphan drug for glioma treatment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) was recently acknowledged and a phase 1 / 2 A open label, non-randomized study was started in patients with advanced solid tumors including malignant glioma.
