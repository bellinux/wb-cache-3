5|$|One {{aspect of}} the Carolinian method of {{estimating}} longitude on inter-island sailings is to visualize the target island relative to a second reference island's alignment with a succession of selected stars, points of the star compass. It is a refined system of dead reckoning whereby the navigator constantly synthesizes his position relative to the reference island's location in his <b>mental</b> <b>model.</b> The most remarkable {{thing is that the}} reference island (lu pongank) may be over the horizon, unseen, even imaginary.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{focus on}} {{various aspects of}} {{cognitive}} theory to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an extraneous cognitive load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, {{the construction of a}} coherent <b>mental</b> <b>model</b> in the learning process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning situations that are associated with low working memory activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.|$|E

500|$|For a {{traditionally}} trained navigator, these inputs include physical {{signals from the}} sea, skies, and stars, memory signals from his knowledge of star, swell, and wind compasses; and cultural knowledge recorded in chants, dances, and stories. Examples of physical signals include the color, temperature, and taste (salinity) of seawater; floating plant debris; sightings of land-based seabirds flying out to fish; cloud type, color, and movement; wind direction, speed, and temperature; the direction and nature of ocean swells and waves; the position of stars in the sky, and his estimation of the speed, current set, and leeway of his sailing craft. The [...] "compass" [...] he carried was not magnetic but a <b>mental</b> <b>model</b> of where islands are located and the star points that one could use to navigate between them. This <b>mental</b> <b>model</b> would have taken years of study to build; dances, chants (rong), and stories help him to recall complex relationships of geography and location. The stars give him highly reliable position information when visible, but navigators such as Mau managed to keep their position and tracks in mind even when blocked by clouds, using other references such as wind and swell as proxies.|$|E
2500|$|A {{cognitive}} map is [...] "a <b>mental</b> <b>model</b> of objects' spatial configuration that permits navigation along optimal path between arbitrary pairs of points." [...] This mental map is built upon two fundamental bedrocks: layout, {{also known as}} route knowledge, and landmark orientation. Layout is potentially the first method of navigation that people learn to utilize; its workings reflect our most basic understandings of the world.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mental</b> <b>models</b> are {{the basis}} on which {{managers}} make decisions even though external decision support systems may provide help. Research has demonstrated that more comprehensive and dynamic <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> {{seem to be at}} the foundation for improved policies and decisions. Eliciting and comparing such models can systematically explicate key variables and their main underlying structures. In addition, superior dynamic <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> can be identified. This paper reviews existing studies which measure and compare <b>mental</b> <b>models.</b> It shows that the methods used to compare such models lack to account for relevant aspects of dynamic systems, such as, time delays in causal links, feedback structures, and the polarities of feedback loops. <b>Mental</b> <b>models</b> without those properties are mostly static models. To overcome these limitations of the methods to compare <b>mental</b> <b>models,</b> we enhance the widely used distance ratio approach (Markóczy and Goldberg, 1995) so as to comprehend these dynamic characteristics and detect differences among <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> at three levels: the level of elements, the level of individual feedback loops, and the level of the complete model. Our contribution lies in a new method to compare explicated <b>mental</b> <b>models,</b> not to elicit such models. An application of the method shows that this previously non-existent information is essential for understanding differences between managers' <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> of dynamic systems. Thereby, a further path is created to critically analyze and elaborate the models managers use in real world decision making. We discuss the benefits and limitations of our approach for research about <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> and decision making and conclude by identifying directions for further research for operational researchers.

2500|$|Accurate mental {{models are}} one of the {{prerequisites}} for achieving SA. A <b>mental</b> <b>model</b> can be described as a set of well-defined, highly organized yet dynamic knowledge structures developed over time from experience. The volume of available data inherent in complex operational environments can overwhelm the capability of novice decision makers to attend, process, and integrate this information efficiently, resulting in information overload and negatively impacting their SA. In contrast, experienced decision makers assess and interpret the current situation (Level 1 and 2 SA) and select an appropriate action based on conceptual patterns stored in their long-term memory as [...] "mental models". Cues in the environment activate these mental models, which in turn guide their decision making process.|$|E
2500|$|The NTSB further {{determined}} that the pilot's faulty <b>mental</b> <b>model</b> of the airplane's automation logic led to his inadvertent deactivation of automatic airspeed control. In addition, Asiana's automation policy emphasized the full use of all automation and did not encourage manual flight during line operations. The flight crew's mismanagement of the airplane's vertical profile during the initial approach led to a period of increased workload that reduced the pilot monitoring's awareness of the pilot flying's actions {{around the time of}} the unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control. Insufficient flight crew monitoring of airspeed indications during the approach likely resulted from expectancy, increased workload, fatigue, and automation reliance. [...] Lack of compliance with standard operating procedures and crew resource management were cited as additional factors.|$|E

Therefore, a study of the cataloguers’ <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> of the bibliographic universe was carried out to investigate whether the FRBR structure would be confirmed by <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> of cataloguers.

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} that {{project is to}} review the range of {{communication}} possibilities of metaphor, pattern and symbol. New conceptual tools are required to configure very large quantities of information into patterns that are both memorable and meaningful, and metaphor is often the only means to deal comprehensibly with complexity. Moreover, exploring “new ways of thinking” {{in the light of}} enhanced mental imagery (or <b>mental</b> <b>model)</b> appears indispensable inasmuch as furthering “mobilization of public opinion” and the “political will to change” is dependent upon insights that are too complex to be easily communicable. For instance, limitations of dualistic thinking are well-known and holistic approaches may represent more desirable alternatives, but how is it possible to implement such alternatives? The page Challenge: transcending the [...] "switch" [...] metaphor deals with that question.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{terms that}} have been used as AM {{synonyms}} or hypernyms have included desktop manufacturing, rapid manufacturing (as the logical production-level successor to rapid prototyping), and on-demand manufacturing (which echoes on-demand printing in the 2D sense of printing). That such application of the adjectives rapid and on-demand to the noun manufacturing was novel in the 2000s reveals the prevailing <b>mental</b> <b>model</b> of the long industrial era in which almost all production manufacturing involved long lead times for laborious tooling development. Today, the term subtractive has not replaced the term machining, instead [...] it when a term that covers any removal method is needed. [...] Agile tooling is the use of modular means to design tooling that is produced by additive manufacturing or 3D printing methods, to enable quick prototyping and responses to tooling and fixture needs. Agile tooling uses a cost effective and high quality method to quickly respond to customer and market needs, and it can be used in hydro-forming, stamping, injection molding and other manufacturing processes.|$|E

50|$|One view {{of human}} {{reasoning}} is that it depends on <b>mental</b> <b>models.</b> In this view, <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> can be constructed from perception, imagination, or the comprehension of discourse (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Such <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> are similar to architects' models or to physicists' diagrams in that their structure {{is analogous to the}} structure of the situation that they represent, unlike, say, the structure of logical forms used in formal rule theories of reasoning. In this respect, they are a little like pictures in the picture theory of language described by philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein in 1922. Philip Johnson-Laird and Ruth M.J.

40|$|Inspired by the {{question}} of the Club of Rome as to Design could help to translate the ubiquitous knowledge on sustainability into daily practise and Peter Senge's belief on <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> as a limiting factor to implementation of systemic insight (Senge 2006), we explored working with <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> as a sustainable design tool.

We summarize our prototyping exercises with the proposal of a design process using <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> to root sustainability in design practise and thinking beyond present-day eco-design (Liedtke et al 2013, Luttropp and Lagerstedt 2006, Pigosso and McAloone 2015) ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to explore}} the role of <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> in {{knowledge}} development in order to demonstrate how the type and strength of the <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> held by a team contribute to its success in general and to innovation in particular. Design/methodology/approach: Two cases are analysed (a successful and an unsuccessful team) which were developed via observation and interviews. The <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> in each case were analysed to map them to the success or otherwise of the teams. Findings: The first case demonstrates that <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> in a multidisciplinary team can provide opportunity for a shared generation of knowledge for process innovation while open to external influence. The second case demonstrates that, where there are strongly shared <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> that prevent the team from constructing an accurate picture of their present by closing out external influences and pre-selecting desired knowledge, opportunities for innovation are shut down. Practical implications: Where <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> provide a sharing framework without closing out the networks and systems that sustain them, they can foster and support innovation. Managing team openness becomes a priority for supporting innovation. Team leaders will need to consider what types of <b>mental</b> <b>models</b> are developing and foster a focus on innovative outcomes and not processes. A concentration on understanding the current context via challenging given assumptions is recommended. Originality/value: The paper offers clear, practical examples {{of the results of}} teams being encouraged to utilise open and closed systems of <b>mental</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R
