50|$|A {{magneto-optic}} effect is {{any one of}} a number of phenomena in which an electromagnetic wave propagates through a medium that has been altered by the presence of a quasistatic magnetic field. In such a material, which is also called gyrotropic or gyromagnetic, left- and right-rotating elliptical polarizations can propagate at different speeds, leading to a number of important phenomena. When light is transmitted through a layer of <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>material,</b> the result is called the Faraday effect: the plane of polarization can be rotated, forming a Faraday rotator. The results of reflection from a <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>material</b> are known as the magneto-optic Kerr effect (not to be confused with the nonlinear Kerr effect).|$|E
50|$|In particular, in a <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>material</b> the {{presence}} of a magnetic field (either externally applied or because the material itself is ferromagnetic) can cause a change in the permittivity tensor ε of the material. The ε becomes anisotropic, a 3×3 matrix, with complex off-diagonal components, depending of course on the frequency ω of incident light. If the absorption losses can be neglected, ε is a Hermitian matrix. The resulting principal axes become complex as well, corresponding to elliptically-polarized light where left- and right-rotating polarizations can travel at different speeds (analogous to birefringence).|$|E

A compact nanosecond pulse generator can be designed based on the special character of the avalanche transistor.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results in}} two different neighboring areas of research: the magnetic properties of thin ferrite films {{and the application of}} the films in two-dimensional photonic crystals. In the first part, we investigate the accuracy of the customary method for determining the magnetic anisotropy constants of ferrite films by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) experiment. We have improved the method and introduced an experimental procedure to obtain the anisotropy constants with higher precision. The magnetic anisotropy fields are obtained by using FMR on a (111) -oriented yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film made by pulsed laser deposition. Moreover, we found experimentally that the shapes of FMR spectra of laser deposited epitaxial YIG films strongly depend on the orientation of the magnetic bias field with respect to the crystalline axes of the film. Inhomogeneities of the constants of anisotropy throughout the film could be responsible for the complexity of the FMR spectra. We find the special directions of the applied magnetic field in which the contribution of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy has the smallest effect on the ferromagnetic resonance and therefore on the elements of the permeability tensor. In the second part, we study the electromagnetic wave propagation in two-dimensional (2 D) dielectric and magneto-optic photonic crystals (PCs). We have proposed a 2 D PC which is composed of <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>material</b> for the purpose of the enhancement of Faraday rotation in high transmission. It is assumed that the 2 D PC contains a bismuth iron garnet (BIG) film either as the PC background medium or as a defect, embedded in the 2 D PC.

40|$|A {{major issue}} in {{integrated}} optics is the protection of on-chip lasers against undesired external feedback. In non-integrated systems, undesired reflections can be easily blocked using Faraday isolators. However, Faraday isolators require <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>materials,</b> which are difficult to integrate into compact devices. Yu and Fan [1] have proposed a non-magnetic integrated isolator, in which a transverse mode of an optical waveguide is converted to another transverse mode only for a single propagation direction. However, the best implementation so far [2], based on a transversely non-uniform index modulation in a semiconductor, showed high losses. We present a novel design to achieve such a modulation in lowloss dielectric waveguides, using surface acoustic waves. We theoretically describe how to realize the two most essential features, which are a short interaction length and a wide isolation bandwidth. ...|$|R

Depending {{on the final}} application, some properties such as coercivity and magnetic anisotropy can be varied accordingly: for instance waveguide magneto-optic rotators/isolators require the "easy axis" to be in-plane; microwave devices need low coercivity, whereas magnetic recording media need high coercivity. Magnetic properties of magneto-optic garnets can be easily tailored in Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) by changing the deposition conditions: for example, it has been demonstrated that coercivity and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth of YIG films decrease with increasing substrate temperature.

40|$|Photonic {{integration}} {{has proved}} remarkably successful in combining multiple optical devices onto a single chip with {{the benefits of}} added functionality, and reduction in costs, arising from the replacement of manual assembly and alignment of individual components with lithographic techniques. However, the incorporation of optical isolators and related non-reciprocal devices within standard optoelectronic wafer platforms is exceptionally challenging. Preferred <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>materials</b> cannot be exploited as waveguide core layers on semiconductor wafers due to a lower refractive index. Another difficulty is the phase velocity mismatch {{as a consequence of}} the inherent structural birefringence associated with waveguide geometries. Our approach to the integration of an optical isolator with a III-V semiconductor laser involves combining a nonreciprocal mode converter with a reciprocal mode converter, based on an asymmetric profiled rib waveguide, fabricated by Reactive Ion Etching. We demonstrate that suitably tapered waveguides can be employed to connect the mode converter to other sections thereby avoiding problems caused by mode-matching and reflections from the section interfaces. The nonreciprocal mode converter is formed from a continuation of the III-V semiconductor waveguide core with a magneto-optic upper cladding so that Faraday rotation occurs through the interaction of the evanescent tail. The phase velocity mismatch due to the waveguide birefringence is overcome using a quasi-phase-matching approach. Lithography is used to pattern the top cladding so that the film immediately on top of the waveguide core alternates between magnetooptic and a non-magneto-optic dielectric of a similar refractive index. Our first demonstrations used a dielectric (silica or silicon nitride) patterned by etching, or lift-off, on top of a GaAs rib waveguide, over which was deposited a magneto-optic film. This film was deposited by sputtering from a Ce:YIG target and demonstrated magnetic hysteresis, but, as it was not annealed, it was believed to consist of Ce:YIG and/or gamma iron oxide microcrystallites embedded in an amorphous matrix.

40|$|This {{project is}} aimed at the {{integration}} of a polarisation-insensitive optical waveguide isolator on a Silicon-on-Insulator platform. The final device must provide comparable performance for both Transverse Electric and Transverse Magnetic modes at a wavelength of 1550 nm. This is achieved through two core components, a 45 ° Nonreciprocal Polarisation Mode Converter, and a 45 ° Reciprocal Polarisation Mode Converter. In order to realise the Nonreciprocal Polarisation Mode Converter, several materials were investigated, all consisting of Silicon-on-insulator substrates with various thicknesses of the core layer that were coated with films of <b>Magneto-Optic</b> garnet <b>materials.</b> A wide number of <b>Magneto-Optic</b> garnet <b>materials</b> were tested. Among them, the Cerium-Terbium Iron Garnet proved the most promising for two reasons: first, it has a considerable Faraday rotation coefficient; secondly, it can be grown in crystalline form {{without the need for}} a buffer/seed layer, necessary for growing most other garnets. Simulations were carried out for all grown materials in order to identify the most promising design. The simulated designs, however, could not always be translated into fabricated devices, as sometimes growth challenges would hinder the quality of the material. Since the growths on the 340 nm and 500 nm Silicon-on-Insulator platforms provided the best material quality, devices on these material systems were fabricated and optically characterised. Nonreciprocal isolation performance was observed in all fabricated devices, independently of the Magneto-Optic garnet used. On the 340 nm Silicon-on-Insulator platform, the best performance was obtained when Bismuth-Terbium Iron Garnet, either on its own or in combination with Terbium Iron Garnet, was used as Magneto-Optic periodic cladding, leading to more than 3 / 4 π Stokes vector angle. On the 500 nm Silicon-on-Insulator platform instead, Cerium-Yttrium Iron Garnet, either by Magnesium Oxide or on Yttrium Iron Garnet, provided a calculated isolation ratio of 11. 6 dB. The length of the fabricated devices ranged between 3 mm and 6 mm. A reproducible device fabrication process, optical characterisation method and dedicated data analysis process had to be developed for this project. Nonreciprocal Polarisation Mode Conversion was demonstrated for devices on both the 500 nm and 340 nm Silicon-on-Insulator platforms. Moreover, in order to achieve integration of <b>Magneto-Optic</b> garnet <b>materials</b> on Silicon-on-Insulator substrates, Radio-Frequency sputtering was preferred to wafer bonding as it improves the controllability and lends itself better to scaling up production. With regard to the Reciprocal Polarisation Mode Converter, an asymmetric structure consisting of an L-shaped waveguide was chosen. In such a structure, the rotation of the optical axis enables an injected linear polarisation mode to excite hybrid modes and reciprocal mode conversion. The research carried out in this project for the reciprocal polarisation mode converter helped identify major issues with fabrication and characterisation, and lead to the proposal of a new design for further research. This work successfully realised the first integrated polarisation-independent Faraday rotator showing comparable performance for both Transverse Electric and Transverse Magnetic modes. Device operation was based on nonreciprocal polarisation mode conversion, and it was demonstrated on both 500 nm and 340 nm Silicon-on-Insulator platforms. The results shown in this work in terms of performance and footprint prove the technology is suitable for optical integration...|$|R

However, even though theoretical calculations for dielectric tensors have been performed to study the physical origins of magneto-optical phenomena in the multilayer structures, very little work has been done to study the dielectric properties of individual layers. ^ In this dissertation, comprehensive dielectric property studies are performed for magnetic multilayer structures, including magnetron sputter deposited Pt/Co, Au/Co, Pd/Co/, Cu/Co, and Pt/Fe. The full dielectric tensor for magnetic layers and interfacial layers in these structures were determined. The most extensive work was done for Pt/Co structures. Also, the full dielectric tensor for the Heusler compound material NiMnSb was determined, and further studied using a phenomenological Lorentz oscillator model. The results were compared to previously published theoretical predictions, and origins of the Kerr response for these materials were discussed. ^ Two steps were needed to determine the full dielectric tensor. First, the uniaxial dielectric functions (diagonal parts of the dielectric tensors) were determined by in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry and ex situ spectroscopic ellipsometry, for the magnetic multilayer structures and for the NiMnSb thin film structures. Second, the off-diagonal part of the dielectric tensors for all materials were determined by ex situ spectroscopic magneto-optic analysis. ^ As well as the individual layer optical constants, the individual layer thicknesses on a nanometer scale are very important parameters for magneto-optic studies of multilayer structures.
