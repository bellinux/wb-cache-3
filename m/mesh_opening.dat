50|$|Perimeter or barrier {{guarding}} {{refers to}} a barrier placed around a work area where an automated piece of equipment-like a robotic arm-performs a function. This type of guarding is generally a wire partition system, but also can {{take the form of}} pressure sensitive mats or light curtains. Wire partitions systems used as machine guards must be fixed in place either on the machine or around its perimeter. These guarding systems may be configured with various sizes of wire mesh, solid sheet metal, or clear polycarbonate panels. Use of these materials depends on the hazard being guarded and the distance between the hazard and the guard. <b>Mesh</b> <b>opening</b> size of the guard depends on the proximity of the guard to the hazard. If the guard is installed close to moving parts, the mesh openings must be smaller than if the guard is installed a greater distance away from the moving parts. <b>Mesh</b> <b>opening</b> sizes for specific distances from the hazard are defined in ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012. Solid barriers such as sheet metal or clear view polycarbonate can be used to shield the hazard as well as control sparks or liquids. Size of the barrier (height and width) must conform to ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012. Wire partition guards provide a means of access to the guarded equipment with doors, lift out sections, or other controlled openings.|$|E

50|$|The {{screen is}} placed atop a substrate. Ink {{is placed on}} top of the screen, and a floodbar is used to push the ink through the holes in the mesh. The {{operator}} begins with the fill bar {{at the rear of the}} screen and behind a reservoir of ink. The operator lifts the screen to prevent contact with the substrate and then using a slight amount of downward force pulls the fill bar to the front of the screen. This effectively fills the mesh openings with ink and moves the ink reservoir to the front of the screen. The operator then uses a squeegee (rubber blade) to move the mesh down to the substrate and pushes the squeegee to the rear of the screen. The ink that is in the <b>mesh</b> <b>opening</b> is pumped or squeezed by capillary action to the substrate in a controlled and prescribed amount, i.e. the wet ink deposit is proportional to the thickness of the mesh and or stencil. As the squeegee moves toward the rear of the screen the tension of the mesh pulls the mesh up away from the substrate (called snap-off) leaving the ink upon the substrate surface.|$|E

When using codend meshes with larger <b>mesh</b> <b>opening</b> the discard was reduced remarkably. In the reference codend with 80 mm <b>mesh</b> <b>opening</b> the undersized bycatch was 47 % of the total catch of plaice, in the experimental codends with 120 mm <b>mesh</b> <b>opening</b> it was only 7 % and with 130 mm <b>mesh</b> <b>opening</b> just 3 %. On the other hand however, the applied mesh openings in the experimental codends let escape marketable plaice to some extent.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment {{was to develop a}} method to estimate mesh selectivity of pot and comparative catchability between pot and tube for white spotted conger eel (Conger myriaster). About ten times comparative fishing experiments were carried out off Haneda in Tokyo Bay, during October and November every year from 1997 to 2000. The experiment used collapsible pots of 5 <b>mesh</b> <b>openings</b> (21. 0, 18. 1, 15. 5, 13. 6 and 11. 6 mm) and tube of 9. 06 mm hole diameter as control gear. Result of this experiment indicated that pot of larger mesh size caught larger conger. Significant different was found in length distributions between the four years (ANOVA Test, P= 1. 9 x 10 - 45) and then the data were not combined for the analysis. In term of girth-perimeter ratio, R value of 50 % retention and selection range were calculated to be 1. 19 and 0. 24 from estimated logistic parameters, (α,β) =(- 10. 67, 8. 99). When catchability of tube was assumed to be 1, relative catchability of pot with 21. 0, 18. 1, 15. 5, 13. 6 and 11. 6 mm <b>mesh</b> <b>openings</b> were 0. 62, 0. 79, 0. 73, 0. 63 and 0. 51, respectively.

The Memotherm, Symphony, and Smart stents are not amenable to side-branch formation due to their elastic nature. The Palmaz stent should not be used in situations where a creation of side branch is anticipated because of its rigid nature and fixed strut joint, which can lead to balloon entrap-ment.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the <b>mesh</b> <b>opening</b> stiffness of fishing nets {{is an important issue}} in assessing the selectivity of trawls. It appeared that a larger bending rigidity of twines decreases the <b>mesh</b> <b>opening</b> and could reduce the escapement of fish. Nevertheless, netting structure is complex. A netting is made up of braided twines made of polyethylene or polyamide. These twines are tied with non-symmetrical knots. Thus, these assemblies develop contact-friction interactions. Moreover, the netting can be subject to large deformation. In this study, we investigate the responses of netting samples to different types of solicitations. Samples are loaded and unloaded with creep and relaxation stages, with different boundary conditions. Then, two models have been developed: an analytical model and a finite element model. The last one was used to assess, with an inverse identification algorithm, the bending stiffness of twines. In this paper, experimental results and a model for netting structures made up of braided twines are presented. During dry forming of a composite, for example, the matrix is not present or not active, and relative sliding can occur between constitutive fibres. So an accurate modelling of the mechanical behaviour of fibrous material is necessary. This study offers experimental data which could permit to improve current models of contact-friction interactions [4], to validate models for large deformation analysis of fibrous materials [1] on a new experimental case, then to improve the {{evaluation of}} the <b>mesh</b> <b>opening</b> stiffness of a fishing ne...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 A unique channel surface {{enhancement}} technique via diffusion-bonding a {{layer of}} conductive fine wire mesh onto the heating wall was developed and used to experimentally study flow boiling enhancement in parallel microchannels. Each channel was 1000 μm wide and 510 μm high. A dielectric working fluid, HFE 7000, was used during the study. Two fine meshes {{as well as two}} mesh materials were investigated and compared. According to the flow boiling curves for each channel, the amount of wall superheat was greatly reduced for all the mesh channels at four stream-wise locations; and the critical heat fluxes (CHF) for mesh channels were significantly higher than that for a bare channel in the low vapor quality region. According to the plots of local flow boiling heat transfer coefficient h versus vapor quality, a consistent increasing trend for h with vapor quality was observed for all the tested channels until the vapor quality reached approximately 0. 4. However, the three mesh channels showed much higher values of h than the bare channel, with the 100 mesh copper performing the best. Visualization using a high-speed camera was performed thereafter to provide some insights to this enhancement mechanism. A significant increase in nucleation sites and bubble generation was observed, and departure rates inside the mesh channels were attributed to the flow boiling enhancement. A sudden increase of h for mesh channels can also be attributed to the characteristics of nucleate boiling and indicates that nucleate boiling was the dominant heat transfer mode. Another interesting point observed was that the 100 mesh bronze outperformed the 200 mesh bronze for most of the studies. This suggests that nucleations happened inside the <b>mesh</b> <b>openings,</b> instead of on the <b>mesh</b> <b>openings.</b> In addition, an optimal mesh size should exist for HFE 7000 flow boiling...|$|R

Cathodes made from the coarsest mesh (30 -mesh) achieved the highest maximum power of 1616 ± 25 mW m- 2 (normalized to cathode projected surface area; 47. 1 ± 0. 7 W m- 3 based on liquid volume), while the finest mesh (120 -mesh) had the lowest power density (599 ± 57 mW m- 2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that charge transfer and diffusion resistances decreased with increasing <b>mesh</b> <b>opening</b> size. In MFC tests, the cathode performance was primarily limited by reaction kinetics, and not mass transfer.
