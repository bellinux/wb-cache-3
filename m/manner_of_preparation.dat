6000|$|I {{was within}} twenty {{feet of the}} leader, a grey stallion--lord of many brood-mares all deeply {{concerned}} {{for the welfare of}} their fuzzy foals. A cream-coloured beast--I knew him at once for the bad character of the troop--broke back, taking with him some frivolous fillies. I heard the snick of the whips somewhere in the dust, and the fillies came back at a canter, very shocked and indignant. On the heels of the last rode both the stockmen--picturesque ruffians who wanted to know [...] "what in hell" [...] I was doing there, waved their hats, and sped down the slope after their charges. When the noise of the troop had died there came a wonderful silence on all the prairie--that silence, they say, which enters {{into the heart of the}} old-time hunter and trapper and marks him off from the rest of his race. The town disappeared in the darkness, and a very young moon showed herself over a bald-headed, snow-flecked peak. Then the Yellowstone, hidden by the water-willows, lifted up its voice and sang a little song to the mountains, and an old horse that had crept up in the dusk breathed inquiringly on the back of my neck. When I reached the hotel I found all <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> under way for the 4th of July, and a drunken man with a Winchester rifle over his shoulder patrolling the sidewalk. I do not think he wanted any one. He carried the gun as other folk carry walking-sticks. None the less I avoided the direct line of fire and listened to the blasphemies of miners and stockmen till far into the night. In every bar-room lay a copy of the local paper, and every copy impressed it upon the inhabitants of Livingstone that they were the best, finest, bravest, richest, and most progressive town of the most progressive nation under Heaven; even as the Tacoma and Portland papers had belauded their readers. And yet, all my purblind eyes could see was a grubby little hamlet full of men without clean collars and perfectly unable to get through one sentence unadorned by three oaths. They raise horses and minerals round and about Livingstone, but they behave as though they raised cherubims with diamonds in their wings.|$|E

In {{order to avoid}} stress concentrations, corrosion proneness, and other negative consequences of the welding process, steel-concrete connection without welded mechanical shear connectors is sought nowadays.

In the paper, {{the assessment of the}} push-out test configuration was performed from the generalized fracture mechanics point of view. The numerical-analytical modelling of a steel-concrete connection is performed without and with the epoxy interlayer, while 2 D and 3 D modelling is used.

The model of a bi-material notch with various geometry, and material properties is used to simulate various singular stress concentrators that can be responsible for failure initiation.

The connection is achieved by an epoxy adhesive layer gritted with granules. In the tests, specimens made with various <b>manners</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> the epoxy interlayer are tested experimentally.

During the heating of non-ground, ground and pressed synthesized AgI samples, the phase transformations and the corresponding temperatures for one β-AgI and four γ-AgI samples with different β-AgI contents (representing a crystallographic impurity) were identified. The following phase transformations were observed for the non-ground AgI samples: β-AgI → α-AgI at 149. 6 °C (for the β-AgI sample) and γ-AgI → α-AgI at 148. 7 °C or 148. 2 °C for the γ-AgI samples with a minimum content of β-AgI (less than 7 %), as a crystallographic impurity. The phase transition γ-AgI → α-AgI was irreversible because β-AgI was obtained whenever the samples were heated up to 260 °C.

An etch&rinse adhesive (OptiBond FL, Kerr) applied with and without prior acid-etching and a self-etch adhesive (Clearfil SE, Kuraray) were employed to bond the restorative composite (Z 100, 3 M ESPE) to the diversely prepared enamel and dentin surfaces.

Bonding to diamond-sonoabraded and air-abraded enamel and dentin was, in general, not different from bonding to conventional diamond-bur prepared surfaces, whereas, bonding to Er:YAG-irradiated enamel and dentin surfaces in general resulted in a significantly lower bonding effectiveness compared to bonding to diamond-bur prepared surfaces. status: publishe...|$|E
