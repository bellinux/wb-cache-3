50|$|Couching, the {{stitching}} {{of decorative}} cord {{on to the}} surface of a fabric, was used widely across the Islamic world. In Afghanistan, a velvet dress could be worked in military style with gold-coloured threads on the front, sleeves and hem. Chieftains in Montenegro could wear robes heavily couched in gold thread. In Palestine, dresses could be heavily worked in vertical panels with couched threads of metal and cotton. In Syria, jackets were couched with stylised flowers and trees. In the Northwest Frontier of Pakistan, waistcoats were sewn with a combination of appliqué panels and couched <b>metal</b> <b>braid.</b>|$|E

40|$|Flexible water hoses (or {{flexible}} hose connectors) have become commonplace {{in recent years}} and provide a low-cost and convenient alternative to rigid pipe. Unfortunately, inadequate designs, particularly with regard to the selection of materials and material parameters, have made some hoses prone to failure. Such failures are often initiated by incidental exposure to corrosive substances commonly found in homes (including chlorides in tap water) that attack and corrode the stainless steel <b>metal</b> <b>braid.</b> A failure of the braid then leads to a rupture of the water-carrying tube. We evaluate the design considerations pertinent to flexible water hose failures and consider a recent failure scenario that illustrates some key points...|$|E

50|$|Since {{cartridge}} heaters {{are installed}} {{in a wide variety}} of machines, manufacturers must design the heaters to meet certain clearances. link The cartridge heaters might be terminated with the leads coming out straight, or in a right angle. Also, manufacturers must be careful that the leads are not exposed to temperatures higher than the maximum rating for the lead wire. In order to prevent lead wire damage from temperature, movement or contamination, the lead wire can be protected with a <b>metal</b> conduit, <b>braided</b> <b>metal</b> or silicone sleeves.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Closures of atrial septal defects or {{a patent}} foramen ovale (PFO) are {{increasingly}} performed percutaneously. The experience of late migration {{of a new}} bio-absorbable device is presented here, followed by conceptual discussion. METHODS: Six months post PFO closure with a BioSTAR® device a patient presented with chest pain. Echocardiography showed a hyperechogenic structure perforating the aortic wall. RESULTS: Surgical exploration showed a perforation of the ascending aorta by one metallic, non absorbable arm. This is the second case of late (> 6 months) dislocation of the residual framework of the occluder. CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of perforation of cardiac structures due to secondary dislocation is low. However this complication exists and should kept in mind in symptomatic patients with new onset of chest pain, after percutaneous procedures. The concept of biodegradation, with residual, non absorbable <b>metal</b> <b>braiding,</b> should be reviewed, analyzing in particular long term results and incidence of secondary dislocation...|$|R
40|$|A {{thermal barrier}} for {{extremely}} high temperature applications {{consists of a}} carbon fiber core and one or more layers of braided carbon fibers surrounding the core. The thermal barrier is preferably a large diameter ring, having a relatively small cross-section. The thermal barrier is particularly suited for use {{as part of a}} joint structure in solid rocket motor casings to protect low temperature elements such as the primary and secondary elastomeric O-ring seals therein from high temperature gases of the rocket motor. The thermal barrier exhibits adequate porosity to allow pressure to reach the radially outward disposed O-ring seals allowing them to seat and perform the primary sealing function. The thermal barrier is disposed in a cavity or groove in the casing joint, between the hot propulsion gases interior of the rocket motor and primary and secondary O-ring seals. The characteristics of the thermal barrier may be enhanced in different applications by the inclusion of certain compounds in the casing joint, by the inclusion of RTV sealant or similar materials {{at the site of the}} thermal barrier, and/or by the incorporation of a metal core or plurality of <b>metal</b> <b>braids</b> within the carbon braid in the thermal barrier structure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{origin and}} the {{consequences}} of the electric failure of in-service composite hollow insulators used in railway transportation were investigated. Direct electrical measurements made it possible the detection of partial discharges (PD) and UV emissions allowed of identifying the location of the PD at the interface between <b>metal</b> <b>braids</b> and a silicone liner. To investigate the effects of the damaging PD activity, physicochemical properties of the different polymers were investigated and compared to new samples. The thermomechanical properties of the HTV and RTV silicones showed important alterations in the polymers structure. The chemical analyses of the silicones and nitrile rubber conducted using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy revealed that the polymers were oxidized after electrical failure. The results indicated that the ozone production and UV emission were due to the surface electrical activities. The breakdown of alumina trihydrate (ATH) in the inner HTV silicone liner demonstrated that undesired electrical discharges induced an significant increase of temperature and the formation of moisture in the air present in the hollow insulator. Laboratory artificial aging performed on the silicones and nitrile rubber showed similar degradation as in service. Further electrical experiments conducted on empty hollow insulators enabled the detection of internal PD located in micro-voids present in the adhesive used to bond the HTV silicone liner to the inner composite tube...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 63 - 76 Electric {{discharge}} causing bearing {{and seal}} damage may occur in any nonelectric machine {{as a result}} of static electricity, accidental electromagnetic self excitation of casings, rotors, piping, foundations, galvanic effects, faulty grounding, etc. [1]. In addition, electric machines may develop very high shaft currents (order of 100 amp in large generators) because of inherent electrical characteristics. Shaft riding brushes can help detect problems and neutralize the currents by shaft grounding. Conventional brushes (carbon, graphite, solid <b>metals,</b> <b>braids,</b> and combinations thereof) have proved to be unreliable. They also develop excessive amounts of conducting dust, require frequent maintenance (cleaning, replacement), and {{it may be necessary to}} shut the unit down for servicing. Other problems include intolerance to oil, water, dirt, other types of environmental contamination, and high surface velocity, and high or low temperature. Some brushes require special slip rings. The development, testing, and application of a patented line of wire-bristle brushes is described along with their electrical characteristics, life expectancy, specification parameters, maintenance and maintainability, etc. Design features, and over 12 years of field experience, especially with turbomachinery and for ship propeller-shaft grounding, are also described. Results of an ongoing three year comparative test program (laboratory and operational) by a major user are described. Hardware will be available for inspection at presentation of paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cardiovascular {{magnetic}} resonance (CMR) {{is considered an}} attractive alternative for guiding transarterial aortic valve implantation (TAVI) featuring unlimited scan plane orientation and unsurpassed soft-tissue contrast with simultaneous device visualization. We sought to evaluate the CMR characteristics of both currently commercially available transcatheter heart valves (Edwards SAPIEN™, Medtronic CoreValve ®) including their dedicated delivery devices and of a custom-built, CMR-compatible delivery device for the Medtronic CoreValve ® prosthesis as an initial step towards real-time CMR-guided TAVI. Methods The devices were systematically examined in phantom models on a 1. 5 -Tesla scanner using high-resolution T 1 -weighted 3 D FLASH, real-time TrueFISP and flow-sensitive phase-contrast sequences. Images were analyzed for device visualization quality, device-related susceptibility artifacts, and radiofrequency signal shielding. Results CMR revealed major susceptibility artifacts for the two commercial delivery devices caused by considerable <b>metal</b> <b>braiding</b> and precluding in vivo application. The stainless steel-based Edwards SAPIEN™ prosthesis was also regarded not suitable for CMR-guided TAVI due to susceptibility artifacts exceeding the valve's dimensions and hindering an exact placement. In contrast, the nitinol-based Medtronic CoreValve ® prosthesis was excellently visualized with delineation even of small details and, thus, regarded suitable for CMR-guided TAVI, particularly since reengineering of its delivery device toward CMR-compatibility resulted in artifact elimination and excellent visualization during catheter movement and valve deployment on real-time TrueFISP imaging. Reliable flow measurements could be performed for both stent-valves after deployment using phase-contrast sequences. Conclusions The present study shows that the Medtronic CoreValve ® prosthesis is potentially suited for real-time CMR-guided placement in vivo after suggested design modifications of the delivery system. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The core may be {{synthetic}} filaments, solid <b>metal,</b> or <b>braided</b> or twisted steel filaments. The uppermost E string {{is usually}} solid steel, either plain or wound with aluminium {{in an effort}} to prevent [...] "whistling." [...] Gold plating delays corrosion of the steel and may also reduce whistling. Stainless steel gives a slightly different tone. Synthetic-core strings, the most popular of which is Perlon (a trade name for stranded nylon) combine some of the tonal qualities of gut strings with greater longevity and tuning stability. They are also much less sensitive to changes in humidity than gut strings, and less sensitive to changes in temperature than all-metal strings. Solid-core metal strings are stiff when newly replaced, and tend to go out of tune quickly.|$|R
50|$|The gaps or holes, {{allow some}} of the {{electromagnetic}} field to penetrate to the other side. For example, braided shields have many small gaps. The gaps are smaller when using a foil (solid metal) shield, {{but there is still}} a seam running the length of the cable. Foil becomes increasingly rigid with increasing thickness, so a thin foil layer is often surrounded by a layer of <b>braided</b> <b>metal,</b> which offers greater flexibility for a given cross-section.|$|R

A fuel cell results when the electrodes are immersed in electrolytes and electrically connected. As hydrogen and oxygen flow through the bore of the fibers, oxidation and reduction reactions develop an electrical potential. Since the hollow fiber configuration provides large electrode area per unit volume and intimate contact between fuel and oxidizer at the interface, and due to the low internal resistance of the electrolyte, high power densities can be obtained...|$|R

Driveshafts used in atherectomy medical devices are often comprised of coiled or <b>braided</b> <b>metal</b> wires. These constructions {{are designed to}} tolerate delivery through tortuous vessels and can endure high speed rotation used during activation of the atherectomy treatment. This research investigated polymer driveshaft designs, which were comprised of polymer inner and outer layers, and coiled or braided stainless steel wires. The polymer driveshaft materials included polyimide, nylon 12, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Mechanical testing of polymer driveshafts was conducted to determine material response in bending, tension, compression, and torsion. The polymer driveshaft test results were then compared with current coiled metal wire driveshaft constructions. The investigation identified polymer driveshaft options that could feasibly work in an atherectomy application...|$|R
40|$|A {{process has}} been {{explored}} based on the state-of-the-art technology to bond the platinum resistance thermometer (PRT) on to potential aerospace material such as a flat aluminum surface and a flexible copper tube to simulate coaxial cable for the flight applications. Primarily, PRTs were inserted into a <b>metal</b> plated copper <b>braid</b> to avoid stresses on the sensor while attaching the sensor with braid to the base material for long duration deep space missions. Appropriate pretreatment has been implemented in this study to enhance the adhesion of the PRTs to the base material. NuSil product has been chosen in this research to attach PRT to the base materials. The resistance (approx. 1. 1 k(Omega)) of PRTs has been electrically monitored continuously during the qualification thermal cycling testing from - 150 C to + 120 C and - 100 C to - 35 C. The test hardware has been thermal cycled three times the mission life per JPL design principles for JUNO project. No PRT failures were observed {{during and after the}} PRT thermal cycling qualification test for extreme temperature environments. However, there were some failures associated with staking of the PRT pig tails as a result of thermal cycling qualification test...|$|R
