MAE used one barrel of a two barrel Weber IDA downdraft carburetor with the other barrel blanked off. The domination of this engine was absolute as long as these regulations lasted until 1968. As Cosworth had a serious difficulty meeting the demand, the MAE was mainly sold as a kit. This experience led to the later FVA/DFV contract to be drawn where the responsibility of development rested with Cosworth, and the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>right</b> and responsibility rested with Ford. There also were some specially cast iron heads with similar dimensions to these brazed heads with Titanium alloy valve spring retainers called the 'Screamer Head' for MAE in later years.|$|R

The five strategies ranges from the basic strategy of having a complete set of singleâ€“operation machines to flexible multiâ€“operation machines. Each strategy is evaluated and a set of guideline is proposed. The results show that when job tardiness and workâ€“inâ€“process is the performance criteria, the duplication strategy is the best. However, if the performance criteria is machine utilisation, then the best strategy is the replacement strategy. ...|$|R

25|$|Chance Manufacturing's first coaster was the Toboggan, a {{portable}} ride {{in which a}} small vehicle climbed vertically up a tower then spiraled back down around the same tower. The ride was invented by Walter House of Amarillo, Texas, and Chance acquired the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>rights</b> and started producing it in 1969. It {{was designed to be}} a carnival ride, fitting on two trailers, but several units were purchased by amusement parks where they were set up as permanent attractions. Chance manufactured 32 of these units, two of which still operate at a permanent park. In 1998 Chance introduced the Big Dipper children's coaster. With the integration of the D. H. Morgan line into Chance Rides in 2001, the company acquired track manufacturing technology and the ability to offer a variety of coaster designs. D. H. Morgan was an offshoot of Arrow Development, original developer of tubular steel track, first used on Disney's Matterhorn Bobsleds attraction. In 2006, Chance formed an alliance with Vekoma. Chance Rides represented Vekoma in North America and manufactured the steel track for select projects. On October 17, 2012 Chance Rides and Vekoma discontinued their agreement to produce rides together for the North American market.|$|E
