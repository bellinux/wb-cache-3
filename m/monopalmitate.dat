40|$|Fatty acid esterification, {{common in}} {{naturally}} occurring astaxanthin, {{has been suggested}} to influence both colour stability and degradation of all-trans-astaxanthin. Therefore, astaxanthin stability was studied as influenced by monoesterification and diesterification with palmitate. Increased esterification decelerated degradation of all-trans-astaxanthin (RP-UHPLC-PDA), whereas, it had no influence on colour loss over time (spectrophotometry). This difference might {{be explained by the}} observation that palmitate esterification influenced the cis-trans equilibrium. Free astaxanthin produced larger amounts of 9 -cis isomer whereas <b>monopalmitate</b> esterification resulted in increased 13 -cis isomerization. The molar ratios of 9 -cis: 13 -cis after 60 min were 1 : 1. 7 (free), 1 : 4. 8 (<b>monopalmitate)</b> and 1 : 2. 6 (dipalmitate). The formation of 9 -cis astaxanthin, with its higher molar extinction coefficient than that of all-trans-astaxanthin, might compensate for colour loss induced by conjugated double bond cleavage. As such, it was concluded that spectrophotometry is not an accurate measure of the degradation of the all-trans-astaxanthin molecule. </p...|$|E

Upon increasing the concentration of Span 40 in the mixture, films became rougher and more heterogeneous, indicating surface enrichment by Span 40 molecules. In the case of mixtures composed by CMCAB and Tween 40, the increase of Tween 40 in the mixture led to smoother and more homogeneous films, indicating compatibility between both components. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that Span 40 and Tween 40 act as plasticizers for CMCAB, leading to dramatic reduction of glass transition temperature of CMCAB, namely, Delta T(g) = - 158 degrees C and Delta T(g) =- 179 degrees C. respectively.

40|$|Purpose. This study {{examines}} the microstructure, gelation tempera-tures, and flow properties of novel amphiphilogels consisting solely of non-ionic surfactants. Methods. Gels were prepared by mixing the solid gelator (sorbitan monostearate or sorbitan <b>monopalmitate)</b> and the liquid phase (liq-uid sorbitan esters or polysorbates) and heating them at 60 °C {{to form a}} clear isotropic sol phase, and cooling the sol phase to form an opaque semisolid at room temperature. Gel microstructure was ex-amined by light and electron microscopy and by small angle neutron scattering (SANS); gelation temperatures were measured by hot-stage microscopy, a melting point apparatus, and high sensitivity dif-ferential scanning calorimetry (HSDSC). Flow rheograms were per-formed to establish the zero-rate viscosity of the gels and their per-formance under shear. Results. Gel microstructures consisted mainly of clusters of tubules of gelator molecules that had aggregated upon cooling of the sol phase, forming a 3 D network throughout the continuous phase. The gels demonstrated thermoreversibility. Gelation temperature and viscos-ity increased with increasing gelator concentration, indicating a more robust gel network. At temperatures near the skin surface tempera-ture, the gels softened considerably; this would allow topical appli-cation. Conclusions.

The mechanical behavior of the bigels was determined using viscometer and static mechanical tester. Gel disintegration studies were carried out at pH 7. 4. The thermal and electrical properties of the bigels were analysed using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and phase-sensitive multimeter, respectively. Goat blood and HaCaT cells were used to test the hemocompatibility and the cytocompatibility of the bigels, respectively. The antimicrobial efficacy of the drug (metronidazole) loaded bigels was studied against E. coli. The efficiency of the bigels as controlled delivery formulations was evaluated in vitro. Iontophoretic delivery of the drugs was carried out by injecting an AC current (peak current of 96. 44 μA). The micrographs suggested the formation of an oleogel-in-hydrogel type of bigels. The particle size of the bigels containing proteins was smaller (4 - 5 μm) than the bigels containing natural polysaccharides and synthetic polymers. Hydrogen bonding was the major driving force in the formation of the bigels. The mechanical properties of the polysaccharide based bigels were better as compared to the other bigels. The firmness of starch bigels and maltodextrin bigels was found to be highest 729. 4421 ± 3. 1471 g and 1000. 7623 ± 1. 8211 g, respectively.

Because of their high aqueous phase content, gels permit a greater dissolution of drugs through the skin and enhance skin hydration by retaining {{a significant amount of}} transepidermal water, in contrast to creams and ointments. Conventionally, gels are differentiated into two different types according to the nature of their liquid phase: hydrogels, which contain a polar solvent (water) and organogels, which contain an organic/non-polar solvent, as external phase. Hydrogels consist of polymeric materials that exhibit the ability to swell and retain a large amount of water or other biofluids in its structures. Despite its great affinity for water, they only possess a swelling behavior without dissolving in water. This proves its high flexibility, similar to natural tissue. Organogels consist of a network of self-assembled molecules which forms a thermally reversible gel upon cooling, immobilizing a non-aqueous liquid. They are mainly composed by lipids (organic phase), so they easily interact with the lipid skin surface and enhance the drug permeation through the skin. The most widely used lipids are based in edible oils due to their high biocompatibility, such as soybean oil, sunflower oil, sesame seed oil or olive oil. Organogels form viscoelastic structures through non-covalent associations with gelling agents in low concentrations. The commonly used organogelators include sorbitan monostearate or sorbitan <b>monopalmitate.</b> These superstructures, often long fibers or needle-shaped structures, which entangle or form pseudocrystalline regions, immobilizing the liquid largely by surface tension and forming a gel of variable consistency. Lecithin organogels are a special type of organogels that do not require addition of any additional surfactant or penetration enhancer, as lecithin serves both the purposes. Recent studies have reported other types of gels for dermal drug application, such as proniosomal gels, emulgels, bigels and aerogels, combining features of conventional hydrogels and organogels. In conclusion, further studies in gel technologies are essentials to overcome the drawbacks of each gel system and for developing cost effective delivery systems for transdermal applications...|$|E
40|$|Proximate {{analysis}} of the commercial shrimp meat waste samples indicated the presence of 94. 6 % protein and 4. 2 % fat on a dry basis. The HPLC analysis revealed the presence of 17 amino acids (proline most abundant) and 7 sugars (ribose being the most abundant). The changes in the concentration of the amino acids and sugars after heat treatment, are explained based on their interaction through the Maillard reaction and by the thermal hydrolysis of proteins and polysaccharides present in tissue. Carotenoid pigments ($ beta$-carotene, canthaxanthin, astacene, and astaxanthin <b>monopalmitate)</b> were extracted and separated by thick layer chromatography. Their structures were identified tentatively by thick layer chromatography (TLC) and subsequently confirmed by Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Lipids were separated and categorized into glycerides, sterols, and phospholipids by thin layer chromatography while flavor-active components were extracted by different organic solvents into acidic, basic, and neutral fractions and their sensory properties determined. The flavor profile of the raw and cooked shrimp meat waste revealed the presence of 59 compounds in raw shrimp compared to 44 in cooked. The components identified were of different functional groups, including fatty acid esters, long chain alcohols, aldehydes, ketanes and hydrocarbons. Many fractions provided desirable aroma (nutty, fruity, floral, green woody, meaty) indicating the presence of important flavor compounds in the commercial shrimp waste. Model {{studies were carried out}} under different experimental conditions (water content, pH), to observe the influence of these parameters on the formation of Maillard reaction products. Furthermore, a comparative study between direct injection of the aqueous solutions and its organic extracts was conducted. The direct injection of aqueous solutions revealed the presence of many water soluble components that were not detected by organic solvent extraction such as droserone and 3, 9 -diazatricyclo$ lbrack 7. 3. 0. 0 sp{*}. 3 sp{*}. 7 sp{ *} rbrack$-dodecan- 2, 8 -dione while maltoxazine and acetanilide are example of compounds identified only in the dichloromethane extracts. Results also demonstrated that monosaccharides affected the yield of the compounds produced whereas the amino acids influenced the sensory properties of these models. Fructose and ribose were found to be the most reactive sugars in their respective categories. Thiazoles were found to be more water soluble whereas $ beta$-carbolines were more abundant in the organic extracts. The influence of water content was investigated in model systems containing fructose or glucose. It was found that water free systems decreased the yield of pyrazines and thiazoles while the formation of pyrrole and pyridine derivatives increased under dry heating conditions. The formation of Maillard reaction products were studied under different pH conditions in order to assess the effect of pH on the formation of heterocyclic compounds. Pyrazine and furan derivatives were the most affected by pH and alanine was found to be a better nitrogen source than lysine in the formation of pyrazines under different pH conditions. Finally, based on energy minimization studies using MM 2 force field, a plausible mechanism was proposed for the formation of maltol in Maillard model systems...|$|E
30|$|Marigold flower (Tagetes erecta) is a plant {{capable of}} synthesizing various {{carotenoids}} of which, once extracted, lutein esters make up around 72 % of them (Lim 2014). Studies aiming {{to increase the}} extraction yield of lutein esters have encouraged researches {{about the effect of}} enzymatic pretreatments to degrade cell walls and membranes in marigold flower (Barzana et al. 2002; Benitez-Garcia et al. 2014; Delgado-Vargas and Paredes-López 1997; Navarrete-Bolanos et al. 2004); however, this native plant of Mexico is mainly used as an ornament. The type and proportion of carotenoids of the plant depend on the variety being mostly lutein and zeaxanthin in yellow flowers, while for white flowers it is mostly lutein, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene (Benitez-Garcia et al. 2014). Studies showed that hydrolysis of zeaxanthin esters to achieve their free forms enhances the bioavailability of this carotenoid (Chitchumroonchokchai and Failla 2006). Unesterified lutein (free lutein) is the most interesting carotenoid since it is in great demand in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries; its commercial market is expected to grow up to US $ 308 million in 2018 (Lim 2014; Lin et al. 2015 a). Thus, carotenoid esters are usually subjected to saponification, which consists in making the oleoresin react with concentrated alcohol solutions of potassium or sodium hydroxide. The disadvantages of saponification are the degradation and isomerization of carotenoids, as well as the power costs and the need to implement safety measures for handling corrosive chemicals and waste products. In addition, the food industry is always looking for more natural alternatives for obtaining their products. Some studies have aimed to replace saponification with the aid of lipases from different microorganisms, but few studies have used marigold oleoresin (Zorn et al. 2003). After pretreatments with bile salts and protease from Streptomyces griseus, mature human milk was treated with lipases from Candida rugosa in order to hydrolyze retinyl esters to obtain free β-carotene and retinol from milk; however, this method still required further chemical hydrolysis (Liu et al. 1998). Hydrolysis of esters of astaxanthin was achieved using the non-specific cholesterol esterase which has been demonstrated to hydrolyze vitamins (Howles and Hui 2001; Jacobs et al. 1982). Carboxyl ester lipase (cholesterol esterase) achieved high activity for papaya and loquat extracts but low activity in incubations with paprika and marigold oleoresins. A porcine pancreatic lipase and a lipase from Candida rugosa was also tested and showed some activity on xanthophyll extracts (Breithaupt et al. 2002). Alkali labile carotenoids were hydrolyzed with a pig liver esterase converting astaxanthin dipalmitate to the <b>monopalmitate</b> and free astaxanthin (Aakermann et al. 1996). Astaxanthin, from Haematococcus pluvialis algal cell extracts, was effectively hydrolyzed by 5 fungal lipases in Tween 80 -emulsified systems; under optimal conditions of pH, temperature, reaction time, and lipase dosage, free astaxanthin recoveries of 63.2 % were achieved (Zhao et al. 2011). A process for enzymatic hydrolysis of carotenoid esters and other esters with aims of human and animal consumption has been presented as a patent; this process consists in the following: (1) incubate the esters with ester- cleaving lipases, and (2) appropriately isolate the resulting free forms (Flachmann et al. 2005). Yarrowia lipolytica is a yeast that has the potential industrial application of producing α-ketonic, acetic, citric, isocitric, pyruvic, and succinic acid; furthermore, it produces extracellular enzymes such as proteases and lipases of great industrial interest (Fletcher 2006; Gajdos et al. 2015); recently, metabolically engineered Y. lipolytica has been applied in fermentations where omega- 3 eicosapentaenoic acid, a fatty acid {{with a wide range of}} health benefits, is produced by carefully balancing expression levels of pathway enzymes and modifying fatty acid and lipid metabolism (Xie et al. 2015). This microorganism has the ability to use fatty acids as a carbon source but the metabolism of these hydrophobic compounds is not yet fully understood; nevertheless, there are various proposed mechanisms in the literature for the use of fatty acids and alcohols by Y. lipolytica (Fickers et al. 2005; Fukuda and Ohta 2013; Hirakawa et al. 2009). It is considered a “safe to use” organism either as final product or as Yarrowia-derived product (Groenewald et al. 2014). Because of the safety of its use and its industrial interest, this work aims to explore the use of lipases produced by this microorganism to assess the lutein esters hydrolysis from an industrially obtained oleoresin into free lutein in flasks and 7  L stirred tank with 7 optimized nutrients. These results will also be compared with the use of lipases from Rhizopus oryzae.|$|E
