40|$|Many {{commercial}} <b>metrology</b> <b>systems</b> {{exist for}} making accurate surface form and roughness measurements of nominally planar parts. However, few <b>metrology</b> <b>systems</b> exist for making accurate absolute thickness measurements.

5000|$|However, {{by the mid}} 2000s, new {{manufacturing}} processes were requiring new process control capabilities, for example the need for control of new [...] "diffusion-less" [...] annealing processes and advanced strained silicon processes. To address these new process control requirements, in 2007, Xitronix Corporation introduced a photo-reflectance system to the semiconductor process control market. Like the Therma-Probe, the Xitronix <b>metrology</b> <b>system</b> utilized a fixed wavelength probe beam generated by a laser. However, the probe beam of the Xitronix system had a wavelength of approximately 375 nanometers, near the first major interband transition in silicon. At this wavelength the electro-modulation signal is dominant, which enabled the Xitronix system to precisely measure active doping concentration in diffusion-less annealing processes. This probe beam wavelength also provided excellent sensitivity to strain in strained silicon processes.|$|E
5000|$|After several {{preliminary}} experiments,a {{joint effort}} in 1984 between the National Bureau of Standards in the U. S. and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundes-Anstalt in Germany resolved {{the problems of}} junction stability and microwave distribution and created the first large Josephson array based on Levinson's idea. [...] Further design improvements and system development produced the first practical 1 V Josephson standards in 1985.Advances in superconductive integrated circuit technology, largely driven by {{the quest for a}} Josephson junction computer,soon made possible much larger arrays. In 1987, the design was extended to a chip with 14484 junctions that generated about 150 000 quantized voltages spanning the range from -10 V to +10 V.Numerous further refinements were made as 10 V Josephson standards were implemented in many national standards laboratories.By 1989, all of the hardware and software for a complete voltage <b>metrology</b> <b>system</b> was commercially available. Today, there are Josephson array voltage standards in more than 70 national, industrial, and military standards laboratories around the world. A program of international comparisons carried out by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) has measured differences between a traveling Josephson standard and those of NMIâ€™s that are typically less than 1 part in 109.|$|E
40|$|Abstract External <b>metrology</b> <b>systems</b> are {{increasingly}} being integrated with traditional industrial articulated robots, especially in the aerospace industries, to improve their absolute accuracy for precision operations such as drilling, machining and jigless assembly. While currently most of the metrology assisted robotics control systems are limited in their position update rate, such that the robot has to be stopped {{in order to receive}} a metrology coordinate update, some recent efforts are addressed toward controlling robots using real-time metrology data. The indoor GPS is one of the <b>metrology</b> <b>systems</b> that may be used to provide real-time 6 DOF data to a robot controller. Even if there is a noteworthy literature dealing with the evaluation of iGPS performance, there is, however, a lack of literature on how well the iGPS performs under dynamic conditions. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the dynamic measurement performance of the iGPS, tracking the trajectories of an industrial robot. The same experiment is also repeated using a laser tracker. Besides the experiment results presented, this paper also proposes a novel method for dynamic repeatability comparisons of tracking instruments...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{integrating}} <b>metrology</b> <b>systems</b> into production processes has generated significant interest in industry {{due to its}} potential in reducing production time and defective parts. One {{of the most interesting}} methods of integrating metrology into production is the usage of external <b>metrology</b> <b>systems</b> to compensate machine tools and robots in real time. Continuing the work described in our previous paper of a prototype laser tracker-assisted 3 -axis positioning system (Wang and Maropoulos Int J Adv Manuf Technol 69 (1 - 4) : 919 - 933, 2013), this paper describes experimental results of the dynamic path accuracy tests of the machine under real-time laser tracker compensation. Experiments show that the real-time corrections of the machine toolâ€™s absolute volumetric error have significantly increased the dynamic path accuracy of the machine. This result is also validated by a ballbar acting as an independent measurement instrument, reducing the 95 th percentile error from 60 Â Î¼m to less than 10 Â Î¼m, without any prior calibration or error mapping, showing that the proposed methods are feasible and can have very wide applications...|$|R

5000|$|Two {{researchers}} at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Drs. Vitaliy Fadeyev and Carl Haber have {{been experimenting with}} an audio restoration method which involves taking a very high definition digital photographic image of the vintage recording medium. They use a precision optical <b>metrology</b> <b>system</b> (designed to scan silicon detectors) to form {{an image of the}} groove on a 78 rpm record. After processing the digital file, they have an audio stream that represents the variations in the groove walls, allowing them to 'play' the record virtually without using a phonograph stylus. 2D images can be made more quickly and have proved worthy of further investigation on 78 rpm discs cut laterally. A 3D method is possible, though it takes much longer for the photographic survey of the recording and it requires much more storage space for the larger digital file. 3D methods are required for non-flat media such as [...] "hill-and-dale" [...] recordings (an early vertical cutting method by PathÃ©), Edison cylinders and Dictabelt rolls. 3D imaging is required for stereo phonograph records in order to capture the full detail of both inner and outer groove walls.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, where spectroscopic {{information}} is not required, photo-reflectance techniques have been implemented in semiconductor manufacturing process control. For example, in the late 1980s, Therma-Wave, Inc. introduced the [...] "Therma-Probe" [...] photo-modulated reflectance system to the market for semiconductor process control equipment. The original Therma-Probe focused an intensity modulated pump laser beam onto a spot on a silicon sample, modulating the sample reflectance. The reflectance changes were detected by a coincident laser probe beam of 633 nanometer wavelength. At this wavelength no electro-reflectance signal is present, since it is far removed from any interband transitions in silicon. Rather, the mechanisms responsible for the Therma-Probe signal are thermo-modulation and the Drude free carrier effect. The Therma-Probe was used primarily for monitoring of the ion implantation process in silicon semiconductor manufacturing. Measurement systems such as the Therma-Probe are particularly desirable in process control of microelectronics manufacturing because they provide the ability to quickly verify the correct execution of process steps, without contacting the wafer or removing the wafer from the clean room. Generally a number of measurements will be made on {{certain areas of the}} wafer and compared with expected values. As long as the measured values are within a certain range, the wafers are passed for continued processing. (This is known as statistical process control.) Other photo-modulated reflectance systems marketed for process control of implant processes are the [...] "TWIN" [...] <b>metrology</b> <b>system</b> marketed by PVA TePla AG, and the [...] "PMR-3000" [...] marketed by Semilab Co. Ltd (originally Boxer-Cross, Inc.).|$|E

This is a significant technical development that demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed methods and can have wide-scale industrial applications by enabling low-cost and structural integrity machine tools that could be deployed flexibly as end-effectors of robotic automation, to achieve positional accuracies that were the preserve of large, high-precision machine tools...|$|R

These systems include a tip/tilt camera (TTCam), distance measuring interferometers (DMI), guide probes (GP), and wavefront sensors (WFS). While the TTCam and DMIs are to monitor the mechanical alignment of the WFC, the WFSs and GPs will produce direct measurement of the optical alignment of the WFC with respect to the HET primary mirror. Together, these systems provide fully redundant alignment and pointing information for the telescope, thereby keeping the WFC in focus and suppressing alignment-driven field aberrations. In addition to these closed-loop <b>metrology</b> <b>systems,</b> we will have a pupil viewing camera (PVCam) and a calibration wavefront sensor (CWFS).
