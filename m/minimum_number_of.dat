30|$|Described {{here is a}} {{simplified}} method for fabrication of DNA nanotubes using a <b>minimum</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> staple oligomers for DNA origami. For this purpose, the cylindrical nanotemplates with two sticky ends have been designed using caDNAno software.

Finally, the produced nanostructures were joined together through their sticky ends using a ligase enzyme. Transmission electron microscope confirmed fabrication of these elongated nanotubes. In addition, high-resolution microscopy of DNA nanotubes by scanning tunnelling microscope indicated efficient attachments of the primarily DNA nanostructures via their sticky ends.
