Experimental results demonstrated that indole was effectively removed through the electro-Fenton process; while in the considered experimental conditions, the performances of EF were only slightly improved by the addition of UVA radiation. The most efficient operating conditions were achieved at pH 3. 0 in the presence of 200 mg L− 1 Fe-ABs catalyst (corresponding to an average iron concentration of 64 mg L− 1) with a current density of 0. 53 mA cm− 2. Under these conditions, 60 min were sufficient to completely degrade 20 mg L− 1 of indole, whose removal was found to obey the pseudo-first order model. In terms of organic carbon removal, about 90 % mineralization yield was reached in the optimal conditions for 7 h heterogeneous electro-Fenton treatment time. UPLC–MS/MS analysis was applied to identify and follow the evolution of indole oxidation products. Five stable organics intermediates were observed and four of them were identified as dioxindole, isatin, oxindole and anthranilic acid. A reaction sequence was therefore proposed for indole degradation according to the detected products.

Extensive tests were performed to determine the removal characteristics, pressure drops, metabolic products, and removal kinetics of the BTFs. The BTFs were operated in continuous mode at low loading rates varying from 0. 59 to 5. 00 g H 2 Sm− 3 h− 1 with an empty bed retention time (EBRT) of 25 s. The removal efficiency (RE) for each BTF was > 99 % in the steady-state period, and high standards were met for the exhaust gas.

40|$|The {{adverse effect}} of natural organic matter (NOM) on the {{capacity}} of activated carbon to adsorb 2 -methylisoborneol (MIB), a compound with an earthy/musty odor, is less severe for submicron-sized powdered activated carbon (SPAC) than for conventionally sized powdered activated carbon (PAC) [11]. In this study the NOM effect was confirmed, and the mechanism responsible for the effect was investigated by studies with another <b>malodorous</b> <b>compound,</b> geosmin. The mechanism was investigated {{with respect to the}} properties of NOM by simplified equivalent background compound (EBC) estimation and penetration index. Correlations between penetration index values and fractional areas of size-exclusion chromatogram indicated that higher NOM loading on SPAC were associated mainly with a fraction of NOM having a molecular weight (MW) > 2 kDa and a chromophoric moiety, which did not diffuse into the inner region of adsorbent particles and instead adsorbed only onto their external surfaces. Therefore SPAC, which has a larger specific surface area per unit mass of adsorbent, adsorbs such high-MW chromophoric NOM {{to a greater extent than}} does PAC. However, such NOM does not compete for adsorption sites with geosmin because geosmin adsorbs onto the interior surfaces of adsorbent particles. Contrariwise, NOM with a MW of < 2 kDa and with an nonchromophoric moiety penetrates adsorbent particles and adsorbs onto interior surfaces. The estimated EBC concentration and its correlations with both size-exclusion chromatogram fractions and penetration index values indicated the characteristics of the NOM that competes with geosmin to be similar to those of MIB. Chromophoric NOM with a MW of < 230 Da competes for adsorption sites with both geosmin and MIB. Beside the nonchromophoric, low-MW (< 2 kDa) NOM, such chromophoric, very-low-MW NOM also penetrates adsorbent particles and adsorbs onto interior surfaces. The loading of such NOM is therefore independent of the size of the carbon particles (SPAC or PAC). The NOM effects on geosmin adsorption capacity were therefore found to be similar for SPAC and PAC, despite the fact that more NOM was loaded onto SPAC than PAC. The very-low-MW chromophoric NOM accounted for < 2 % of the entire NOM. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract During {{treatment}} of winery and distillery wastewater by natural evaporation in ponds, formation of <b>malodorous</b> <b>compounds</b> induces harmful olfactory effects. In this work, we studied {{the origin of}} <b>malodorous</b> <b>compounds</b> and methods to prevent and treat odours. The formation of volatile fatty acids (VFA) from pure substrates (glycerol, lactic and tartaric acids, ethanol) and complex media (winery and distillery wastewater) was studied. Various anaerobic bacteria ferment the glycerol and produce butyric or propionic acid. Valeric and caproic acids were observed at lower concentrations than butyric and propionic acids, but their malodorous intensities were higher. Microflora produce butyric, valeric, caproic, heptanoic and octanoic acids from ethanol, {{the main component of}} winery wastewater. When nitrate (an electron acceptor) is added, catabolism leads to an anaerobic respiration phenomenon (denitrification). The organic compounds are oxidised to CO 2 and the nitrate is reduced to N 2 (odourless compounds), without VFA formation. The preventive {{treatment of}} odours by nitrate addition was tested on an industrial scale in winery and distillery ponds. Furthermore, the study took the effect of nitrate on VFA degradation into consideration. The results make it possible to consider using nitrate for the curative treatment of pond odours...|$|R

The dissertation is organized into two sections based on the natural division of studies {{done in the past}} several years. Part I includes studies involving the estimation of binding constants and partition coefficients and the modeling of pseudophase gas-liquid chromatography. The binding of solutes to pseudophases, such as micelles and cyclodextrins, is an important phenomenon in numerous areas of chemistry. Here, the ability of various native and derivatized cyclodextrins to sequester oral <b>malodorous</b> <b>compounds</b> and other volatile solutes was examined by measuring their association constants. Numerous techniques were utilized to determine the solute-cyclodextrin affinities. The results {{of this study indicate that}} cyclodextrins are capable of binding with a wide variety of oral <b>malodorous</b> <b>compounds</b> to varying degrees. The equations used in this study were then developed further and applied to the separation of several enantiomers using a methylated-cyclodextrin/polysiloxane stationary phase. These calculations allow the contributions from all three solute equilibria to retention and selectivity to be measured. This work was then extended to micellar/ionic liquid gas-liquid chromatography stationary phases, and the Abraham solvation parameter model was used in order to deconvolute the types of interactions responsible for analyte partitioning to these two phases. Part II of this dissertation focuses on the work done on the development of a rapid capillary electrophoretic sterility test. This technique coalesces all cells in a sample into a single peak and removes them from potential interferences in the sample matrix.

40|$|Oxidation of <b>malodorous</b> <b>compounds</b> such as {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOC), hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) and {{volatile organic}} sulphur compounds (VOSC) generally leads to a significant decrease or even a complete elimination of their odour nuisance. Unfortunately, the oxidation rates of these compounds are often slow under standard conditions of temperature and atmospheric pressure. Even the oxidation rates of easily oxidisable compounds can still be too limited for complete oxidation and elimination of their odour nuisance. The latter is often related to the very low odour threshold values of these compounds, which can easily be in the ppb range.

Composting MSW is considered {{as a method of}} transferring organic waste materials from landfills to a product, which is suitable for agricultural purposes at a relatively low cost (Eriksen et al. 1999; Wolkowski 2003). Composting MSW reduces the volume of the waste, kills pathogens that may be present, decreases germination of weeds in agricultural fields, and destroys <b>malodorous</b> <b>compounds.</b> Converting the municipal waste to compost is very important because useful materials as compost produced from waste has been widely used for agricultural and horticultural purposes (Mavaddati et al. 2010). Composting of MSW has the potential to become a beneficial recycling tool for waste management in Iran. The major barriers against the use of compost are their handling, application, and storage due to its low density. Therefore, these bulky residues can be densified into pellets by the extrusion process. Pelletizing is a method of increasing the bulk density of biomass with mechanical pressure (Erickson and Prior 1990). Pellets have low moisture content (about 12 % wet basis (w.b)) and high bulk density (more than 1, 000  kg/m 3).

The {{emission}} of <b>malodorous</b> <b>compounds</b> and {{the accumulation of}} solids {{are two of the}} major challenges confronting swine production facility wastewater treatment. A project was undertaken to test the effectiveness of a commercial chemical formulation, Bio-Kat from NRPGroup, Inc., in remediating anaerobic treatment lagoons, through the reduction of gaseous emissions and solids. In other wastewater systems, Bio-Kat stimulates the indigenous microbes to more effectively remediate wastes. When Bio-Kat was applied to the surface of barn pit wastewaters, gaseous ammonia emissions were substantially reduced. Application of Bio-Kat to the primary treatment lagoon reduced total and volatile solids, ammonia, sulfides, and chemical oxygen demand. Taken together, these results indicate that Bio-Kat was apparently effective in enhancing the remediation of swine wastewaters leading to savings for the farmer and reducing environmental impacts.

Some antibacterial textiles already exist in hospitals or for clothing, such as textiles treated with silver [1], quaternary ammonium compounds [2, 3], triclosan [4] and deriva-tives, etc. However, these solutions could lead to the partial destruction of the skin resident flora which is the im-munological barrier of the skin providing a defense against pathogens. The alternative way explored in this work is the use of photocatalysis [5] in order to inhibit the growth of bacteria that causes odors and directly destroy the <b>malodorous</b> <b>compounds...</b>|$|R
40|$|Volatile sulfur {{compounds}} are {{cause of}} concern because, when present in high concentrations, they constitute a danger for health {{because of their}} strong toxicity. Furthermore, for low concentrations, they are often a cause of complaint, because of their low odor threshold. In this context, {{the purpose of this}} Thesis is to evaluate a new technology for the abatement of sulfur-based <b>malodorous</b> <b>compounds.</b> The investigated technology consists in the use of ozone generating low-pressure UV mercury lamps, operating at room temperature. Hydrogen sulfide is often found in industrial processes, (e. g. WWTPs (Wastewater Treatment Plants), leather production, sewage treatment, garbage disposal, etc). Moreover, it presents both a very high toxicity a low odor threshold. Thus, due to its high representativeness of the case, hydrogen sulfide was chosen as reference compound {{for the purposes of this}} project. In order to evaluate a wide range of cases, several experiments using different residence times, humidity contents and inlet concentrations of the pollutant were conducted. The obtained results show that this technology generally presents discrete conversion efficiencies, although not suffcient to be used as freestanding process. For this reason, a pretreatment is revealed to be necessary. The best conversion efficiency was obtained for low flow rates and high moisture content. At the end of the project, as side-study, a possible pretreatment using an adsorbent bed constituted by granular ferric oxide was evaluated. ...|$|R
40|$|Particulate matter {{expelled}} from tunnel-ventilated animal feeding operations (AFOs) {{is known to}} transport <b>malodorous</b> <b>compounds.</b> As a mitigation strategy, vegetative environmental buffers (VEBs) are often installed surrounding AFOs in order to capture particulates and induce lofting and dispersion. Many farmers are or are interested in implementing VEBs, yet research supporting their efficacy remains sparse. Currently, point measurements, often combined with models, are the primary means by which emission rates from AFOs and VEB performance has been investigated. The existing techniques lack spatial resolution and fail to assign the observed particulate reduction to capture, lofting, or dispersion. In recent years, lidar {{has emerged as a}} suitable partner to point measurements in agricultural research. Lidar is regarded for its ability to capture entire plume extents in near real time. Here, a technique is presented for estimating the capture efficiency of a VEB using lidar. An experiment was conducted in which dust was released upwind of a VEB at a known rate, and the emission rate downwind of the VEB was estimated using an elastic scanning lidar. Instantaneous lidar scans showed periodic lofting well above the VEB, but when scans were averaged over several hours, the plumes appeared Gaussian. The experiment revealed a capture efficiency ranging from 21 - 74 β, depending on the time of day. The methodology presented herein addresses deficiencies in the existing techniques discussed above, and the results presented add to the lacking body of research documenting VEB capture efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Phenol, p-cresol, and {{volatile}} fatty acids (VFA; acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, and valeric acids) were used as odor indicators of swine waste. Aeration of the waste allowed the indigenous microorganisms to grow and degrade these malodorous substances. The time required for degradation of these substances varied according to the waste used, {{and it was not}} necessarily related to their concentrations. Using a minimal medium which contained one of the <b>malodorous</b> <b>compounds</b> as sole carbon source, we have selected from swine waste microorganisms that can grow in the medium. The majority of these microorganisms were able to degrade the same substrate when inoculated in sterilized swine waste but with an efficiency varying from one strain to the other. None of these strains was able to degrade all malodorous substances studied. Within 6 days of incubation these selected strains degraded the following: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, phenol and all VFA; Alcaligenes faecalis, p-cresol and all VFA; Corynebacterium glutamicum and Micrococcus sp., phenol, p-cresol, and acetic and propionic acids; Arthrobacter flavescens, all VFA. On a laboratory scale, the massive inoculation of swine waste with C. glutamicum or Micrococcus sp. accelerated degradation of the malodorous substances. However, this effect was not observed with all of the various swine wastes tested. These results suggest that an efficient deodorization process of various swine wastes could be developed at the farm level based on the aerobic indigenous microflora of each waste...|$|R
40|$|Musth is an {{important}} male phenomenon affecting many aspects of elephant society including reproduction. During musth, the temporal gland secretions (as well as the urine and breath) of adult male Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) discharge a variety of <b>malodorous</b> <b>compounds</b> together with the bicyclic ketal, frontalin. In contrast, teenage male elephants in musth release a sweet-smelling exudate from their facial temporal gland. We recently demonstrated that the concentration of frontalin becomes increasingly evident as male elephants mature. In the present study, we demonstrate that behaviors exhibited towards frontalin are consistent and dependent on the sex, developmental stage and physiological status of the responding conspecific individual. To examine whether frontalin functions as a chemical signal, perhaps even a pheromone, we bioassayed older and younger adult males, and luteal- and follicular-phase and pregnant females for their chemosensory and behavioral responses to frontalin. Adult males were mostly indifferent to frontalin, whereas subadult males were highly reactive, often exhibiting repulsion or avoidance. Female chemosensory responses to frontalin varied with hormonal state. Females in the luteal phase demonstrated low frequencies of responses, whereas pregnant females responded significantly more frequently, with varied types of responses including those to the palatal pits. Females in the follicular phase were the most responsive and often demonstrated mating-related behaviors subsequent to high chemosensory responses to frontalin. Our evidence strongly suggests that frontalin, a well-studied pheromone in insects, also functions as a pheromone in the Asia...|$|R
