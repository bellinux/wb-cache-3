50|$|The law {{holds for}} the A and E {{proposition}}s of the Aristotelian square of opposition. For example, the A proposition 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' and the E proposition 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' cannot both be true {{at the same}} time, since {{no one can be}} honest and not honest at the same time. But both can be false, if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest, and some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not. For if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest, the proposition 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' is false. And if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not honest, the proposition 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' is false also.|$|R
50|$|A {{universal}} affirmative proposition, such as, 'Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' and {{a universal}} negative proposition {{having the same}} subject and predicate, such as, 'No <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white,' are called contrary. A universal affirmative proposition ("Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white") and the non-universal denial of that proposition in a way ("Some <b>man</b> <b>is</b> not white") are called contradictories. Of contradictories, one must be true, the other false. Contraries cannot both be true, although they can both be false, and hence their contradictories are both true (for example, both, 'Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest,' and 'No <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest,' are false. But their contradictories, 'Some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not honest,' and, 'Some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest,' are both true.|$|R
5|$|The exact {{death toll}} during the New York Draft Riots is unknown, but {{according}} to historian James M. McPherson, 119 or 120 people were killed. In all, eleven black men were lynched over five days. The riots forced hundreds of black people to flee the city. Violence by longshoremen against black <b>men</b> <b>was</b> especially fierce in the docks area.|$|E

5000|$|Universal {{statements}} <b>are</b> contraries: 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> just' and 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> just' {{cannot be}} true together, although {{one may be}} true and the other false, and also both may be false (if at least one <b>man</b> <b>is</b> just, {{and at least one}} <b>man</b> <b>is</b> not just).|$|R
50|$|In track events, SP2 {{women in}} H2 have faster laptimes than SP1 men in H1. Factoring {{is used in}} cycling to allow {{multiple}} classes and genders to compete against each other.

5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} {{party of}} 30 <b>men</b> <b>was</b> sent {{out from behind}} the third stone wall to see if the British would try and flank the American position. The party ran into the British, who had continued to advance, and they fell back to the stone wall. The Americans behind the wall fired one volley before Glover gave the order to retreat. The Americans retreated across a bridge over the Hutchinson stream, their retreat covered by the 150 men of the 14th Continentals who engaged in an artillery duel with the British. Howe camped on a hill {{on the opposite side of}} the stream but made no attempt to cross the stream.|$|E
50|$|Another logical {{opposition}} {{implied by}} this, though not mentioned explicitly by Aristotle, is 'alternation' (alternatio), consisting of 'subalternation' and 'superalternation'. Alternation is a relation between a particular statement and a universal {{statement of the}} same quality such that the particular is implied by the other. The particular is the subaltern of the universal, which is the particular's superaltern. For example, if 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is true, its contrary 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is false. Therefore the contradictory 'some <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is true. Similarly the universal 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' implies the particular 'not every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white'.|$|R

60|$|But, I say, what is {{the reason}} some so prize what others so despise, since they both stand in need of the same grace and mercy of God in Christ? Why, the one sees, and the other sees nothing, of this woeful miserable state. And thus have I showed you the {{necessity}} of a broken heart. 1. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> dead, and must <b>be</b> quickened. 2. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> a fool, and must be made wise. 3. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> proud, and must <b>be</b> humbled. 4. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> self-willed, and must <b>be</b> broken. 5. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> fearless, and must be made to consider. 6. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> a false believer, and must <b>be</b> rectified. 7. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> a lover of sin, and must be weaned from it. 8. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> wild, and must <b>be</b> tamed. 9. <b>Man</b> disrelishes the things of God, and can take no savour in them, until his heart is broken.|$|R
5|$|After the American {{defeat at}} the Battle of Queenston Heights, {{command of the}} U.S. Army of the Centre on the Niagara Frontier passed from Major General Stephen Van Rensselaer of the New York Militia to his second-in-command, Brigadier General Alexander Smyth of the Regular U.S. Army. Smyth had deeply resented being subordinated to a militia officer {{and this was the}} {{opportunity}} for which he had been waiting. He immediately planned to invade Canada with 3,000 troops. Assembling his forces at Buffalo, he directed a two-pronged attack in advance of his main invasion. Captain William King, with 220 <b>men,</b> <b>was</b> to cross the Niagara and spike the batteries at the Red House, beside Fort Erie, in order to enable Smyth’s main invasion force to land without facing artillery fire. At the same time, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Boerstler, with 200 <b>men,</b> <b>was</b> to land in Canada between Fort Erie and Chippawa and destroy the bridge over Frenchman’s Creek in order to hinder the bringing-up of British reinforcements to oppose Smyth's landing.|$|E
5|$|As {{the role}} of native cavalry grew, that of Roman/Latin cavalry diminished. In the early 1st century BC, Roman cavalry was phased out altogether. After the Social War, the socii were all granted Roman citizenship, the Latin alae abolished, and the socii {{recruited}} into the legions. Furthermore, Roman equestrians were no longer required to perform cavalry service after this time. The late Republican legion was thus probably bereft of cavalry (a tiny cavalry force of 120 <b>men</b> <b>was</b> probably added back to the legion under Augustus).|$|E
5|$|As {{with earlier}} campaigns, {{recruiting}} enough <b>men</b> <b>was</b> a problem. Jefferson {{called for the}} western counties of Virginia to provide militia manpower for Clark's campaign, but county officials protested {{that they could not}} spare the men. Militiamen did not want to set out on a lengthy expedition—they would be gone for six months to a year—while their families and homes were threatened by Lord Cornwallis's army in the east, by Indian raids from the north, and by Loyalists at home. Because of this resistance, Jefferson called for volunteers rather than ordering the militia to accompany the expedition.|$|E

5000|$|... 'Contrary' (medieval: contrariae) statements, {{are such}} that both cannot {{at the same time}} be true. Examples of these are the {{universal}} affirmative 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white', and the universal negative 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white'. These cannot be true at the same time. However, these are not contradictories because both of them may be false. For example, it is false that every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white, since some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not white. Yet it is also false that no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white, since there <b>are</b> some white <b>men.</b>|$|R
5|$|At Stockach, the French {{concentrated}} {{their forces}} into shorter lines, creating intense fighting conditions; initially, Charles's line was more extended, {{but he quickly}} pulled additional troops from his reserves to strengthen his front. When a small French force commanded by Dominique Vandamme nearly flanked the Austrian Army, Charles's personal intervention was crucial for the Austrians, buying time for reinforcements to arrive. General Jourdan, while trying to rally his <b>men,</b> <b>was</b> nearly trampled to death. Ultimately, the French were driven back upon the Rhine River.|$|E

5|$|Before World War One men {{generally}} had longer {{hair and}} beards. However, short hair on <b>men</b> <b>was</b> introduced in World War One for soldiers. Slaves and defeated armies were often required to shave their heads. The trench warfare in 1914 to 1918 exposed men to flea and lice infestations, which prompted {{the order to}} cut short hair, establishing a military tradition, and it expanded among civilians by imitation.|$|E

The propaganda campaign had begun well before the invasion, with the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing {{tens of thousands of}} leaflets throughout Latin America.
