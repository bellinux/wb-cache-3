500|$|The episode {{as a whole}} {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Rae Votta of Billboard wrote that it [...] "stumbles {{as much as it}} shines, with two plot lines-worth of structure that make sense, and two that fall completely flat". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman stated that [...] "while there were undeniably significant plot moments, the emotional depth was lacking", and Robert Canning of IGN said it was [...] "kind of boring" [...] and nothing happened to [...] "make it better than bland". AOLTV Crystal Bell found it frustrating, and said that the [...] "worst part" [...] was that it [...] "made <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> caring about these characters". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "a ton of it just didn't work". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson looked on the episode more favorably, however, and maintained that while it did not achieve the level of the previous two, it was a [...] "pretty strong outing nonetheless".|$|E
500|$|The young Stanford {{was given}} a {{conventional}} education at a private day school in Dublin run by Henry Tilney Bassett, who concentrated on the classics {{to the exclusion of}} other subjects. Stanford's parents encouraged the boy's precocious musical talent, employing a succession of teachers in violin, piano, organ and composition. Three of his teachers were former pupils of Ignaz Moscheles, including his godmother Elizabeth Meeke, of whom Stanford recalled, [...] "She taught me, before I was twelve years old, to read at sight. ... She made me play every day {{at the end of my}} lesson a Mazurka of Chopin: never letting <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> for a mistake. ... By the time I had played through the whole fifty-two Mazurkas, I could read most music of the calibre my fingers could tackle with comparative ease." [...] One of the young Stanford's earliest compositions, a march in D major, written when he was eight years old, was performed in the pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Dublin three years later. At the age of seven, Stanford gave a piano recital for an invited audience, playing works by Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Moscheles, Mozart and Bach. One of his songs was taken up by the University of Dublin Choral Society and was well received.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Scott of Sky Living wrote, [...] "while Clarkson {{is doing}} well musically, her love life still hasn't picked up and she is heartbroken once again. I'm sure the thought of another top ten hit might cheer her up!" [...] Scott Juba of The Trades {{considered}} [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] as {{the highlight of the}} album, writing [...] "Now that [...] {{a few years older than}} she was when she recorded her first album, she brings more authenticity to relationship songs." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters compared [...] "Don't Let <b>Me</b> <b>Stop</b> You" [...] (2009) with [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] saying that the former [...] "may sound like another rewrite of an older Clarkson hit (in this case, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes"), but the observational lyrics about a questionable relationship are what ultimately makes the whole thing click." [...] Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine felt that the song should sell records more because [...] "the entire musical backing drops out to let Clarkson’s voice through to live or die on its own." [...] Pam Avoledo of Blogcritics believed that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] was superior to the writing of [...] "Since U Been Gone", commenting that [...] "It's punchier, well-written and gives Clarkson a chance to show off her vocal skills without the trendy haughtiness." [...] Joe Cross of Cox Communications thought that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] was a decent follow-up to [...] "Since U Been Gone", saying [...] "It's no [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] which is just a pop-rock juggernaut, but as follow-ups go, it's not too shabby. Clarkson's down-home everything (well, mostly her looks) sells these little heartbreak haikus exceptionally well." [...] He also listed [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] as one of the 40 songs that defined the summer of 2005. The same sentiment was echoed by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy who considered the song as Clarkson's second best single after [...] "Since U Been Gone", writing [...] "It proved a slow burner at the time of release, but this track's greatness continues to be realised over time." ...|$|E

Journalist George Monbiot wrote [...] "Why Fukushima made <b>me</b> <b>stop</b> worrying and love nuclear power." [...] In it he said, [...] "As a result of the disaster at Fukushima, I am no longer nuclear-neutral. I now support the technology." [...] He continued, [...] "A crappy old plant with inadequate safety features was hit by a monster earthquake and a vast tsunami. The electricity supply failed, knocking out the cooling system. The reactors began to explode and melt down. The disaster exposed a familiar legacy of poor design and corner-cutting.
