5|$|Later in the century, from 1882, Arthur Blomfield {{and his son}} Charles made further {{additions}} and modifications, including restoring and reinstating the Shrine of StWerburgh. <b>More</b> <b>work</b> {{was carried}} out in the 20thcentury by Giles Gilbert Scott between 1891 and 1913, and by F.H.Crossley in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1956 he was {{selected}} at the Staff School run by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). His first trip outside Nigeria {{was an opportunity to}} advance his technical production skills, and to solicit feedback on his novel (which was later split into two books). In London, he met a novelist named Gilbert Phelps, to whom he offered the manuscript. Phelps responded with great enthusiasm, asking Achebe if he could show it to his editor and publishers. Achebe declined, insisting that it needed <b>more</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} similarities, Jack Garrick in 1982 grouped {{this species}} with the bignose shark (C. altimus) and the sandbar shark (C. plumbeus), while Leonard Compagno in 1988 placed {{it as the}} sister species of the grey reef shark (C. amblyrhynchos). A phylogenetic analysis based on allozyme data, published by Gavin Naylor in 1992, indicated that the Caribbean reef shark is the sister taxon to a clade formed by the Galapagos shark (C. galapagensis), dusky shark (C. obscurus), oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus), and the blue shark (Prionace glauca). However, <b>more</b> <b>work</b> is required to fully resolve the interrelationships within Carcharhinus.|$|E

Discovering a tear in his suit, he visits superhero costume designer Edna Mode. Mode, assuming that Helen knows what Bob is doing, makes new suits for the entire family. However, she rejects Bob's request for a cape, citing the large number of Supers who perished when their capes got caught in something.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{soon found}} {{work with a}} new company, and went on tour with his brother – who was also {{pursuing}} an acting career – in a comedy sketch called Repairs. In May 1906, Chaplin joined the juvenile act Casey's Circus, where he developed popular burlesque pieces and was soon {{the star of the}} show. By the time the act finished touring in July 1907, the 18-year-old had become an accomplished comedic performer. He struggled to find <b>more</b> <b>work,</b> however, and a brief attempt at a solo act was a failure.|$|E
5|$|Game hunting was a {{familiar}} beneficial skill to the colonists when they immigrated to the New World. Most northern colonists depended upon hunting, whether they hunted themselves or purchased game from others. As a method of obtaining protein for consumption, hunting was preferred over animal husbandry as domestic animals were expensive and <b>more</b> <b>work</b> was required to defend domestic animals against natural predators, Native Americans, or the French. Commonly hunted game included deer, bear, buffalo, and turkey. The larger parts of the animals were roasted and served with currant and other sauces, while smaller portions went into soups, stews, sausages, pies, and pasties.|$|E

5|$|He {{was then}} {{commissioned}} {{to repair a}} chimney at a local brewery. While working on this, he met a local welder who also knew the vicar of Bolton (Richard Greville Norburn), who wanted some repairs made to Bolton parish church's weathervanes. The vicar drove a 1929Humber limousine and was impressed by Dibnah's AJS motorcycle; the two quickly became friends. The church was the tallest building in Bolton and once Dibnah had repaired the weathervane the vicar asked him to gild it. Dibnah appeared in the local newspaper and the publicity and his friendship with the vicar enabled him to gain <b>more</b> <b>work</b> from the local clergy.|$|E
5|$|Her {{armament}} {{arrived in}} Philadelphia missing electrical cables and with incomplete documentation, which required Cramp's electricians to piece things together themselves, for which Cramp charged an extra $50,000. She was launched on 23 October 1900 and ran her acceptance trials in October 1901. The trials were successful but revealed incomplete work that Cramp had to finish before {{he received his}} last payment. <b>More</b> <b>work</b> {{needed to be done}} on the armament, but it had to wait until she arrived in Russia. Retvizan was accepted on 23 March 1902, under the command of Captain Eduard Schensnovich who commanded her throughout her Russian service.|$|E
5|$|In the Convict Establishment of 1855, the {{day began}} with the wakeup bell at 4:30 am, and the {{officers}} and prisoners assembled in the parade ground at 5:25 am.

This was followed by dinner in the exercise yard or the work site, and <b>more</b> <b>work</b> throughout the afternoon, until supper at 6:00 pm in the cells. Night officers took over at 7:15 pm.|$|E

5|$|Owing {{to several}} {{academic}} commitments, work on Theory of Literature {{did not begin}} until 1945, after Wellek and Warren received a stipend from the Rockefeller Foundation {{over a period of}} two summers. Wellek and Warren began dividing their responsibilities, at first evenly, but with <b>more</b> <b>work</b> done by Wellek as Warren dealt with the illness, and later loss, of his wife Eleanor in 1946. During this period of writing Wellek transferred to Yale University (1946) and Warren to the University of Michigan (1948), but collaboration continued.|$|E
5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of the blacktip shark were originally {{thought to be the}} graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides) and the spinner shark (C. brevipinna), due to similarities in morphology and behavior. However, this interpretation has not been borne out by studies of mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA, which instead suggest affinity with the blacknose shark (C. acronotus). <b>More</b> <b>work</b> is required to fully resolve the relationship between the blacktip shark and other Carcharhinus species.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} workshop was a blacksmith's shop, one of {{the first}} buildings to be constructed on the prison site. Later known as the East Workshops, other workshops included carpenter's, plumber's and painter's, a printing office, and from the 1850s, a metal shop.

5|$|The {{script was}} {{received}} by script editor Melinda M. Snodgrass at a fortunate time.

He passed it onto fellow executive producer Rick Berman, who held onto it for a week while the writers chased the production crew for updates.

She began her refit at Shelburne, Nova Scotia which lasted until November. <b>More</b> <b>work</b> was required at St. John's, Newfoundland and Sasketchewan did not return to Britain until January 1945.|$|E
5|$|Wild wolves are {{sometimes}} kept as exotic pets and, in some rarer occasions, as working animals. Although {{closely related to}} domesticated dogs, wolves do not show the same tractability as dogs in living alongside humans, and generally, much <b>more</b> <b>work</b> is {{required in order to}} obtain the same amount of reliability.
