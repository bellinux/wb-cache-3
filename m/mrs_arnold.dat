25|$|In 1886, {{he retired}} from school {{inspection}} and made another trip to America. Arnold died suddenly in 1888 of heart failure, when running to meet a tram that would have taken him to the Liverpool Landing Stage to see his daughter, who was visiting from the United States where she had moved after marrying an American. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> died in June 1901.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1833, {{an unknown}} species from the Serra dos Órgãos {{mountains}} of Brazil blossomed {{in the greenhouse}} of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> Harrison, an English collector of orchids homaged in diverse descriptions of noted species such as Bifrenaria harrisoniae and Cattleya harrisoniana. A short time later, Mrs. Harrison sent a drawing and cutting of this plant to the botanist John Lindley, who verified it {{to be not only}} a new species but a new genus. In its description, dated the same year, Lindley suggests the name of Leptotes, from the Greek λεπτότητα for mild, delicate, in reference to the appearance of the plant's flowers. He affirmed that Leptotes was similar to Tetramicra, from which it is distinguished by the structures of the pollinarium and by the smaller lateral lobes of the lip petal; and because they have no calcar attached to the ovarium. He also differentiated it from [...] Brassavola by the pollinia and trilobed lip. Lindley then described its type-species, Leptotes bicolor.: Leptotes bicolor in Edward's Botanical Register Vol.19, t.1625. James Ridgway & Sons Ed. London, 1833.|$|E
60|$|The hour wore on, and Hester Dethridge {{appeared}} again. The lad {{was waiting}} for Anne's orders for her mourning, and for her note to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> Brinkworth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! Unfortunately!" [...] Furiously Paul {{turned toward}} the woman, smiling with a fondness sickening to Babbitt. [...] "May! Want to {{introduce}} you. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold,</b> this is my old-acquaintance, George Babbitt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} of the weather, Patrick?" [...] asked <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> from the window, still {{undecided}} about the wisdom of letting her flock go off alone, papa having been called away after the plan was made.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{looks so}} much like snow I {{think it would be}} wiser to put off your {{sleighing}} party, Gwen," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold,</b> looking anxiously out at the heavy sky and streets still drifted by the last winter storm.|$|E
60|$|Washington {{arrived at}} the Robinson House shortly after the flight of the traitor. Being {{informed}} that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> was in her room, unwell, and that Arnold had gone to West Point to receive him, he took a hasty breakfast, and repaired to the fortress, leaving word {{that he and his}} suite would return to dinner.|$|E
6000|$|He {{advances}} {{to the door}} of an inner room. He offers his arm to Lady Lundie. Her ladyship stands immovable; determined to see the woman who has supplanted her. In a moment more, the door of entrance from the hall is thrown open; and the servant announces, [...] "Sir Patrick and Lady Lundie. Mr. and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> Brinkworth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We saw Mr. and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> Brinkworth at Florence, and {{afterward}} at Naples, Lady Lundie. They returned to England a week since, {{in anticipation of}} a certain happy event, which will possibly increase the members of your family circle. They are now in London. Indeed, I may tell you that we expect them here to lunch to-day." ...|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> {{remained}} {{in her room}} in a state bordering on frenzy. Arnold might well confide in the humanity and delicacy of Washington in respect to her. He regarded her with the sincerest commiseration, acquitting her of all previous knowledge of her husband's guilt. During the brief time she remained at the Robinson House, she was treated with the utmost deference and delicacy, but soon set off under a passport of Washington, for her father's house in Philadelphia.|$|E
6000|$|On {{approaching}} the Hudson, Washington {{took a more}} circuitous route {{than the one he}} had originally intended, striking the river at Fishkill, just above the Highlands, that he might visit West Point, and show the marquis the works which had been erected there during his absence in France. Circumstances detained them a night at Fishkill. Their baggage was sent on to Arnold's quarters in the Robinson House, with a message apprising the general that they would breakfast there the next day. In the morning (Sept. 24th) they were in the saddle before break of day, having a ride to make of eighteen miles through the mountains. When within a mile of the Robinson House, Washington turned down a cross road leading to the banks of the Hudson. Lafayette apprised him that he was going out of the way, and hinted that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> must be waiting breakfast for him. [...] "Ah, marquis!" [...] replied he good-humoredly, [...] "you young men are all in love with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold.</b> Go you and breakfast with her, and tell her not to wait for me. I must ride down and examine the redoubts {{on this side of the}} river, but will be with her shortly." [...] The marquis and General Knox, however, turned off and accompanied him down to the redoubts, while Colonel Hamilton and Lafayette's aide-de-camp, Major James McHenry, continued along the main road to the Robinson House, bearing Washington's apology, and request that the breakfast might not be retarded.|$|E
60|$|The {{family with}} the two aides-de-camp sat down to breakfast. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> had arrived but {{four or five days}} {{previously}} from Philadelphia, with her infant child, then about six months old. She was bright and amiable as usual. Arnold was silent and gloomy. It was an anxious moment with him. In the midst of the repast a horseman alighted at the gate. It was the messenger bearing Jameson's letter to Arnold, stating the capture of André, and that dangerous papers found on him had been forwarded to Washington. The mine had exploded beneath Arnold's feet. Controlling the dismay that must have smitten him to the heart, he beckoned <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> from the breakfast table, signifying a wish to speak with her in private. When alone with her in her room up-stairs, he announced in hurried words that he was a ruined man, and must instantly fly for his life! Overcome by the shock, she fell senseless on the floor. Without pausing to aid her, he hurried down stairs, informed his guests that he must haste to West Point to prepare for the reception of the commander-in-chief; and mounting the horse of the messenger, which stood saddled at the door, galloped down to the landing-place, where his six-oared barge was moored. Throwing himself into it, he ordered his men to pull out {{into the middle of the}} river, and then made down with all speed for Teller's Point.|$|E
6000|$|By {{going to}} the inn and openly {{addressing}} her to her face as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> Brinkworth? No! He had had enough, at Windygates, of meeting her face to face. The easy way was to write to her, and send the letter, by the first messenger he could find, to the inn. She might appear afterward at Windygates; she might follow him to his brother's; she might appeal to his father. It didn't matter; he had got the whip-hand of her now. [...] "You are a married woman." [...] There was the one sufficient answer, which {{was strong enough to}} back him in denying any thing! ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{made out}} {{the letter in}} his own mind. [...] "Something like this would do," [...] he thought, as he went round and round the walnut-tree: [...] "You may be {{surprised}} not to have seen me. You have only yourself to thank for it. I know what took place between you and him at the inn. I have had a lawyer's advice. You are Arnold Brinkworth's wife. I wish you joy, and good-by forever." [...] Address those lines: [...] "To <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> Brinkworth;" [...] instruct the messenger to leave the letter late that night, {{without waiting for an}} answer; start the first thing the next morning for his brother's house; and behold, it was done! ...|$|E
6000|$|Slight of {{resolution}} {{as he was}} of body, Paul threw his snow-beaded overcoat {{on the floor and}} crouched on a flimsy cane chair. [...] "Oh, you're an old blowhard, and you know less about morality than Tinka, but you're all right, Georgie. But you can't understand that--I'm through. I can't go Zilla's hammering any longer. She's made up her mind that I'm a devil, and--Reg'lar Inquisition. Torture. She enjoys it. It's a game to see how sore she can make me. And me, either it's find a little comfort, any comfort, anywhere, or else do something a lot worse. Now this <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold,</b> she's not so young, but she's a fine woman and she understands a fellow, and she's had her own troubles." ...|$|E
6000|$|Colonel Hamilton {{returned}} to the Robinson House and reported the escape of the traitor. He brought two letters also to Washington, which had been sent on shore from the Vulture, under a flag of truce. One was from Arnold, in which he wrote: [...] "I ask no favor for myself. I have too often experienced the ingratitude of my country to attempt it; but, from the known humanity of your Excellency, I am induced to ask your protection for <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> from every insult and injury that a mistaken vengeance of my country may expose her to.... I beg she may be permitted {{to return to her}} friends in Philadelphia, or to come to me as she may choose." [...] The other letter was from Colonel Beverley Robinson, interceding for the release of André, on the plea that he was on shore under the sanction of a flag of truce, at the request of Arnold.|$|E
60|$|December 1846.--Henry Fletcher and I dined at the Mount on the 21st of this month. The party {{consisted}} of Mr. Crabb Robinson (their Christmas guest), <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold,</b> Miss Martineau, and ourselves. My mother's cold was too bad {{to allow her}} to go, which I regretted, as it was, like all their little meetings, most sociable and agreeable. Wordsworth was much pleased with a little notice of his new edition in the Examiner; he thought it very well done. He expressed himself very sweetly at dinner on the pleasant terms of neighbourly kindness we enjoyed in the valleys. It will be pleasant in after times to remember his words, and still more his manner when he said this, it was done with such perfect simplicity and equality of feeling, without the slightest reference to self, and I am sure without thinking of himself at the time as more than one of the little circle whose friendly feeling he was commending.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold,</b> on {{arriving}} at her father's house in Philadelphia, had {{decided on a}} separation from her husband, to whom she could not endure the thoughts of returning after his dishonor. This course, however, was not allowed her. The executive council, wrongfully suspecting her of having aided in the correspondence between her husband and André, knowing its treasonable tendency, ordered her to leave the State within fourteen days, and not to return during the continuance of the war. [...] "We tried every means," [...] writes one of her connections, [...] "to prevail on the council to permit her to stay among us." [...] It was all in vain, and, strongly against her will, she rejoined her husband in New York. She returned home but once, about five years after her exile, and was treated with such coldness and neglect that she declared she never could come again. In England her charms and virtues, it is said, procured her sympathy and friendship, and helped to sustain the social position of her husband, who, however, was [...] "generally slighted, and sometimes insulted." [...] She died in London, {{in the winter of}} 1796.|$|E

The Arnolds are invited to spend some time in the castle with them, too, and are soon puzzled by strange events happening in the castle: odd noises that occur, eyes in portraits that shine mysteriously, lights that shine in tower rooms, despite being locked tight. It seems that there are unknown people who do not want them to stay in the castle.|$|E

The House was built with eleven bedrooms, each with a marble fireplace and adjoining marble bath, and an elevator. The rooms of Charles’ daughter, the late <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> B.

50|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> and Mrs. Bauer are {{knitting}} gloves. The gloves are one-size-fits-all, and two gloves make a pair {{that they}} sell for €5. They have each made 3 gloves. How do {{they share the}} proceeds from the sale? The problem can be described by a characteristic function form game with the following characteristic function: Each lady has 3 gloves, that is 1 pair with a market value of €5. Together, they have 6 gloves or 3 pair, having a market value of €15. Then all possible distributions of this sum are imputations, where none of the ladies gets less than €5, the amount they can achieve on their own. For instance (7.5, 7.5) is an imputation, but so is (5, 10) or (9, 6).|$|E
