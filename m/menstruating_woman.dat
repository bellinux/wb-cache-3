If this punishment is not exacted, the Ashanti believe, the ghost of the ancestors would strangle the chief. Menstruating women lived in special houses during their periods as they were forbidden to cross the threshold of men's houses. They swore no oaths and no oaths were sworn for or against them.

500|$|The Libellus {{consists}} {{of a series of}} responses (responsiones) by Gregory to [...] "certain jurisprudential, administrative, jurisdictional, liturgical and ritual questions Augustine was confronted with as leader of the fledgling English church". The numbering and order of these responses differ across the various versions of the Libellus (see below). But in the most widely known version (that reproduced in Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica) there are nine responses, each of which begins by re-stating or paraphrasing Augustine's original questions. Gregory's first response addresses questions about the relationship of a bishop to his clergy and vice versa, how gifts from the laity to the church should be divided amongst the clergy, and what the tasks of a bishop were. The second response addresses why the various northern European churches of which Augustine was aware had differing customs [...] and liturgies, and what Augustine should do when he encounters such differences. The third response was in answer to questions about the proper punishment of church robbers. The fourth and fifth response deal with who might marry whom, including whether it was allowed for two brothers to marry two sisters, or for a man to marry his step-sister or step-mother. The sixth response addresses {{whether or not it was}} acceptable for a bishop to be consecrated without other bishops present, if the distances involved prevented other bishops from attending the ceremony. The seventh response deals with relations between the church in England and the church in Gaul. The eighth response concerns what a pregnant, newly delivered, or <b>menstruating</b> <b>woman</b> might do or not do, including whether or not she is allowed to enjoy sex with her husband and how long after child-birth she has to wait to re-enter a church. The last response answers questions about whether or not men might have communion after experiencing a sexual dream, and whether or not priests might celebrate mass after experiencing such dreams. An additional chapter, not included by Bede in his Historia is known as the [...] "Obsecratio": it contains a response by Gregory to Augustine's request for relics of the local British martyr Sixtus. Gregory responds that he is sending relics of Pope Sixtus II to replace the local saint's remains, as Gregory has doubts about the actual saintly status of the British martyr. Although the authenticity of the [...] "Obsecratio" [...] has occasionally been questioned, most modern historians accept that it is genuine.|$|E

2500|$|In her Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven, Uta Ranke-Heinemann {{says that}} three discussions of {{marriage}} in the New Testament (Matthew 19, I Corinthians 7, and Ephesians 5:22-32) do not refer to generating children, which later became consistently emphasized in Catholic moral doctrine as {{the primary purpose of}} sexual relations, although, according to her, those texts does not indicate that conceiving children is excluded in marriage. The view that marriage is primarily intended for the purpose of procreation dominated early Christianity, and held by many Church Fathers. During the entire Middle Ages, the question of when intercourse was allowed and when it was not, was very important. Intercourse was prohibited on all Sundays and all the many feast days, as well as the 20 days before Christmas, the 40 days before Easter, and often the 20 days before Pentecost, as well as three or more days before receiving Communion (which at that time was offered only a few times a year). These forbidden days altogether totaled about 40% of each year. Some church leaders warned believers that children conceived on holy days would be born leprous, epileptic, diabolically possessed, or crippled. Penalties of 20 to 40 days of strict fasting on bread and water were imposed on transgressors. Intercourse was forbidden during the menstrual period and after childbirth, since [...] "physicians mistakenly believed that the blood of a <b>menstruating</b> <b>woman</b> or one who has just given birth was poisonous". It was also forbidden during pregnancy, with concern for protecting the fetus as the main reason. [...] "Christian theologians", including Pope Gregory I, held that abstinence should continue until a baby was weaned.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{clinical}} implications of administering thrombolytic therapy to <b>menstruating</b> <b>women</b> with acute myocardial infarction. Background. Although anecdotal case reports have suggested that thrombolytic therapy is safe during menstruation, the risk of increased bleeding in <b>menstruating</b> <b>women</b> receiving such therapy is poorly defined. Methods. We identified <b>menstruating</b> <b>women</b> who received thrombolytic therapy by soliciting information on all North American women enrolled in the GUSTO-I trial and then collected additional information about them with use of a one-page data form. We compared the characteristics and outcomes of these women with other GUSTO-I patient populations, including all North American women below the median age of menopause, all women and all patients. Results. The median age of the 12 <b>menstruating</b> <b>women</b> was 46 years; 75 % were cigarette smokers. The median hospital stay was 7 days, 2 fewer than the overall stay in GUSTO-I. None of these women died or had a stroke or severe bleeding. Three patients (25 %) had moderate bleeding (vaginal in two patients [66 %]) that required transfusion compared with 11 % of all GUSTO-I patients and all North American premenopausal women (p = 0. 13) and 17 % of all female GUSTO-I patients (p = 0. 47). Because of the small sample size of 12 women, the power was low (0. 37) to detect the observed difference in moderate bleeding. The median nadir hematocrit was 33 % in the <b>menstruating</b> <b>women</b> compared with 34 % in the premenopausal women and all women. The median time from symptom onset to treatment for the 12 women was 3. 7 h, which was 0. 9 h longer than the overall median in the trial (p = 0. 09). Conclusions. Although there was no statistically significant increase in bleeding risk during menstruation, this fact may be a result of low statistical power rather than a lack of effect. Thus, the results suggest that there may be a clinically significant increase in the risk of moderate bleeding. Nevertheless, the GUSTO-I experience is consistent with the concept that the lifesaving benefit of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction should generally not be withheld because of active menstruation...|$|R
