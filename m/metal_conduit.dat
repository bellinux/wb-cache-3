40|$|Abstract. The failure time of polyvinylchloride（PVC) {{insulated}} {{power cables}} was studied using an infrared radiation heating furnace and insulation resistance measurements. The temperature-time curve inside the furnace {{was similar to}} that of the ISO 834 standard. Two popular fire protection methods were employed for the cables; one method applied fire-retardant coatings directly on the cable surface, and the other inserted the cables into <b>metal</b> <b>conduits</b> coated with structural steel fire-retardant coating. The results showed that for both protection methods, the failure time of the cable increased with the thickness of the coating. However, if the cable coatings were thicker than 1. 5 mm, the coating will crack in the case of cable movement. When the steel structural coating was thinner than 1 mm or thicker than 3 mm, the protective effect was not remarkable for the relatively small expansion multiple. For the longest failure time of the cables, less than 10 minutes in these tests, neither of the two methods was effective in protecting the electrical cables that supply power (on transmit a signal) to equipment required to operate over a relatively long duration in fire conditions...|$|R

Cables intended for very flexible service or in marine applications may be protected by woven bronze wires. Power or communications cables (e.g., computer networking) that are routed in or through air-handling spaces (plenums) of office buildings are required under the model building code to be either encased in <b>metal</b> <b>conduit,</b> or rated for low flame and smoke production.|$|E
50|$|A {{waveguide}} flange is {{a connector}} for joining sections of waveguide, and {{is essentially the}} same as a pipe flange—a waveguide, {{in the context of this}} article, being a hollow <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> for microwave energy. The connecting face of the flange is either square, circular or (particularly for large or reduced-height rectangular waveguides), rectangular. The connection between a pair of flanges is usually made with four or more bolts, though alternative mechanisms, such as a threaded collar, may be used where there is a need for rapid assembly and disassembly. Dowel pins are sometimes used in addition to bolts, to ensure accurate alignment, particularly for very small waveguides.|$|E
50|$|Conduit may be {{installed}} underground between buildings, structures, or devices to allow installation {{of power and}} communication cables.

A duct bank will allow replacement of damaged cables between buildings or additional power and communications circuits to be added, without the expense of re-excavation of a trench. While <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> is occasionally used for burial, usually PVC, polyethylene or polystyrene plastics are now used due to lower cost, easier installation, and better resistance to corrosion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Corrosion causes <b>metals</b> {{delivering}} (<b>conduit</b> materials) {{into the}} conveyed liquid. If the corrosion be very rapid, {{it will cause}} pipes cavitation. Then, the intrusion of contaminants into the pipes result in negative suction and if the water has been scaling tendency, a scale layer will introduce, then induce internal scaling and reduce convey potential in pipes. The aim {{of this research was}} determining the corrosion potential of produced water in Ilam Water Treatment Plant during 2007 to 2008. For this reason the measures of temperature and pH determined by pH meter model E 520 manufactured of Switzerland at site and determining of Total Dissolved Solids, calcium hardness, calcium, total alkalinity and bicarbonate concentration had done in laboratory according to standard method manual. Values of pHs, Langlier Saturation Index, Ryznar Stability Index, Aggressiveness Index, Puckorius Scaling Index and Larson Ratio, calculated twice at month during 12 months between 2007 to 2008. The calculated results showed that the mean and Standard Deviation values of Langlier Saturation Index, Ryznar Stability Index, Aggressiveness Index, Puckorius Scaling Index and Larson Ratio are equal to 0. 29 and 0. 5, 7. 45 and 0. 17, 12. 44 and 0. 16, 7. 99 and 0. 14 and 0. 77 and 0. 1, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a joint initiative between Oak Ridge National Laboratory, operated by UT-Battelle, and Bechtel Jacobs Company, LLC (BJC) to characterize, package, transport, treat, and dispose of demolition waste from the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), Cooling Tower. The demolition and removal of waste from the site was the first critical step in the planned HFIR beryllium reflector replacement outage scheduled. The outage was scheduled to last a maximum of six months. Demolition and removal of the waste was critical because a new tower was to be constructed over the old concrete water basin. A detailed sampling and analysis plan was developed to characterize the hazardous and radiological constituents of the components of the Cooling Tower. Analyses were performed for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) heavy metals and semi-volatile constituents as defined by 40 CFR 261 and radiological parameters including gross alpha, gross beta, gross gamma, alpha-emitting isotopes and beta-emitting isotopes. Analysis of metals and semi-volatile constituents indicated no exceedances of regulatory limits. Analysis of radionuclides identified uranium and thorium and associated daughters. In addition 60 Co, 99 Tc, 226 Rm, and 228 Rm were identified. Most of the tower materials were determined to be low level radioactive waste. A small quantity was determined not to be radioactive, or could be decontaminated. The tower was dismantled October 2000 to January 2001 using a detailed step-by-step process to aid waste segregation and container loading. The volume of waste as packaged for treatment was approximately 1982 cubic meters (70, 000 cubic feet). This volume was comprised of plastic ({approx} 47 %), wood ({approx} 38 %) and asbestos transite ({approx} 14 %). The remaining {approx} 1 % consisted of the fire protection piping (contaminated with lead-based paint) and incidental <b>metal</b> from <b>conduit,</b> nails and braces/supports, and sludge from the basin. The waste, except for the asbestos, was volume reduced via a private contract mechanism established by BJC. After volume reduction, the waste was packaged for rail shipment.

50|$|PVC conduit {{has long}} been {{considered}} the lightest in weight compared to steel conduit materials, and usually lower in cost than other forms of conduit. In North American electrical practice, it is available in three different wall thicknesses, with the thin-wall variety only suitable for embedded use in concrete, and heavier grades suitable for direct burial and exposed work. Most of the various fittings made for <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> are also available in PVC form. The plastic material resists moisture and many corrosive substances, but since the tubing is non-conductive an extra bonding (grounding) conductor must be pulled into each conduit. PVC conduit may be heated and bent in the field, by using special heating tools designed for the purpose.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 55 - 58) The {{gravitational settling}} dynamics of molten iron droplets through silicate material {{is an important}} process during the early impact history of the Earth where settling may have occurred within magma oceans or within <b>metal</b> plume <b>conduits</b> descending rapidly to form the metallic cores in terrestrial bodies. Implications for equilibration of liquid metal in the silicate mantle are key in aiding {{our understanding of the}} thermo-chemical evolution of Earth. To simultaneously meet geochemical constraints for rapid core formation as well as siderophile trace element distribution throughout the upper mantle, an emulsion of iron droplets or an emulsion metal plume may be important. Previous experiments have shown that descending metal silicate plumes entrain magma ocean material in trailing conduits that travel to the core-mantle boundary. It has also been shown that the style of metal emulsions will descend through these conduits in two stages, as a coalesced group within the plume head and later settling through the conduit column. However, the nature of iron settling through a magma ocean and within conduits is only understood in a rudimentary way. Here, I consider physical fluid models which study the settling of liquid iron droplets through silicate melts using liquid gallium emulsions and glucose solutions. I test the effect of several physical properties including the metal volumetric ratio, density difference, fluid viscosity, metal droplet diameter, and liquid versus solid metal spheres. Three stages are observed during gravitational settling. Regime 1 reveals rapid sinking of liquid metal droplets and entrainment of low-density (light element) fluids into a metal pond and into the core itself, regime 2 is characterized by upward migration of entrained fluid and regime 3 couples slow compaction of metal droplets at the base with final segregation of residual glucose solution. Results show that high volumetric ratios and low viscosity ratios of metal to magmas will have faster sinking velocities and metal pond or core formation times. I find that increased metal volumetric ratio and liquid (versus solid) metal spheres demonstrates more entrainment of magma into a metal pond or into the core. Higher levels of entrainment predicts the presence of light elements in the core during its formation and suggests ???bottom-up??? migration of light elements and metal-silicate segregation at high pressures during post core forming events. Upward migration of light elements will leave behind higher bulk density metals that initiate overturn in the outer core and can assist in powering the geodynamo. Finally, the settling process of emulsion metal droplets through magma oceans, plume conduits, and entrainment into the core provide a large surface areas and longer residence time for metal-silicate equilibration to address the excess siderophile observation while still descending rapidly enough to form the Earth's core in 30 My. I observe a metal sediment layer that forms above the metallic core after settling. If this sediment layer is stable, it may be entrained in upwelling mantle plumes over the Earth???s history and contribute towards mixing of siderophile elements with mantle minerals...|$|R

Through a combination of galvanic corrosion (where the copper refrigerant pipes were in physical contact with the aluminum electrical conduit, causing the conduit to erode over time), and vibration - as well as jagged edges and stretched wires resulting from poor workmanship during the installation - the electrical wires inside the conduit ended up missing chunks of their plastic insulation, and the conduit was rendered un-grounded (there was no separate ground wire; the <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> itself was designed to function as the ground, so {{the disintegration of the}} conduit rendered the system un-grounded).|$|E
