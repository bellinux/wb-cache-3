The 7010 was introduced in 1962 as a mainframe-sized 1410. The later Systems 360 and 370 could emulate the 1400 <b>machines.</b> A <b>desk</b> size <b>machine</b> with a different instruction set, the IBM 1130, was released concurrently with the System/360 to address the niche occupied by the 1620. It used the same EBCDIC character encoding as the 360 and was mostly programmed in Fortran, which was relatively easy to adapt to larger machines when necessary.|$|R

The few people trying to understand this child have given him a name, not a satisfactory name, but a name; they call him C(culturally deprived. 2 ̆ 2 What defines him is not an absence of money or nice clothes or good furniture or cars or food, although all these objects are usually lacking. These children suffer from poverty of experience. Perhaps their lives are rich with experience their teachers know nothing about.

50|$|Program errors were {{difficult}} to find. Programmers could sit at the <b>machine</b> control <b>desk</b> watching the <b>machine</b> perform one instruction {{at a time to}} see where unintended events occurred. However, machine time became more and more valuable so John Bennett suggested that Mrs Berners-Lee write a diagnostic program to print out the contents of the accumulator and particular store lines at specific points in the program so that diagnosis could take place away from the machine. The challenge of her routine 'Stopandprint' was that it had to monitor the program under diagnosis without interfering with it, and there was very little space in the fast store. With J M Bennett and D. G. Prinz, she was involved in writing interpretive subroutines that were used by the Ferranti group.|$|R

5000|$|As Cooke-Yarborough {{wrote of}} his design in 1953 [...] "a slow {{computer}} can only justify its existence {{if it is}} capable of running for long periods unattended and the time spent performing useful computations is {{a large proportion of the}} total time available". The design was noted for its reliability because in the period from May 1952 until February 1953 it averaged 80 hours per week running time. Dr Jack Howlett, Director of the Computer Laboratory at AERE 1948-61, said it [...] "could be left unattended for long periods; I think the record was over one Christmas-New Year holiday when it was all by itself, with miles of input data on punched tape to keep it happy, for at least ten days and was still ticking away when we came back." [...] It was the machine's untiring durability, rather than its speed, that was its main feature. Human mathematicians (a job role called a [...] "hand-computer") could make calculations at a similar speed, but not continuously for the same lengths of time. Dr Howlett commented: One day EB ‘Bart’ Fossey, an excellent hand-computer (still with what used to be called the Atlas Computer Laboratory), settled down beside the <b>machine</b> with his <b>desk</b> <b>machine</b> and attempted a race. He kept level for about half an hour working flat out, but had to retire, exhausted; the machine just ploughed on.|$|R
40|$|The {{first four}} decades of {{computer}} technology are each characterized by {{a different approach to}} the way computers were used. In the 1950 s, programmers would reserve time on the computer and have the computer all to themselves while they were using it. In the 1960 s, batch processing carne about. People would submit their jobs which were queued for processing. They would be run one at a time and the owners would pick up their output later. Time-shanng became the way people used computers in the 1970 s so that users could share a computer under the illusion that they had it to themselves. The 1980 s are the decade of personal computing: people have their own dedicated <b>machine</b> on their <b>desks...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Relayer was {{recorded}} at Squire's garage studio, marking {{the first time}} Yes had made a studio album outside of London. The process was cheaper as they no longer needed to pay fees to book studio time, which allowed the band {{to spend more time}} on the music. It is their last from the 1970s to feature Eddie Offord as their producer before he left to pursue other projects. Having worked with Yes as their producer, engineer, and live sound mixer since 1970, Offord later stated that his time with the group had become [...] "a bit stale" [...] by the time of Relayer. As Squire's studio did not yet have the right equipment to record, Offord set up a 24-track recording <b>machine</b> and mixing <b>desk</b> using his own equipment, and was joined by Genaro Rippo as his tape operator. The album's production duties were shared by Offord and the group. After the album {{was recorded}}, it was mixed at Advision Studios in London.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an innovative modeling, interfacing and training framework and application for microtunneling machines under heterogeneous {{gravel and sand}} soils, based on a machine simulator. It is initialized using a selective collection of skilled pilots' know-how during {{the performance of a}} pipe jacking microtunneling machine operation, generating a rule-based system based on grouped rules and states that replicate the machine's performance. The adjustment of these states and associated rules allows the creation, setup and analysis of a realistic functional model for tunneling machines. The developed system integrates a friendly Human-Machine Interface (HMI) that closely resembles real machines' pilot cabinets and allows natural interaction with the implemented inference engine through the simulated control panel. Additionally, the framework allows the training of tunneling machine operators by simulation and subsequent gathered data analysis, obviating or reducing mechanical movement times if desired. The virtual pilot's desk allows global training time and cost reductions, and increases safety for future operatorsand machinery. The HMI is divided into two screens, which replicate the data and the command panels of a real <b>machine's</b> control <b>desk.</b> The presented framework has allowed the first implementation of a jack piping microtunneling machine simulator by means of the developed pilots' steering know-how capture methodology.

50|$|Mort Mort Feingold (Andy Samberg) is an old-school, low tech, Jewish CPA with {{an old-fashioned}} adding <b>machine</b> on his <b>desk</b> and stacks upon stacks of paper files {{all over his}} office. He specializes in {{preparing}} tax returns for wealthy celebrities and the sketches lampoon the publicly perceived lifestyles, eccentricities, and vices of those celebrities through Mort Mort's comments about their financial records. Mort Mort himself is a composite of good-natured Jewish stereotypes and throughout each sketch he delivers {{a steady stream of}} Borscht Belt comic style self deprecating one liners about himself and about his clients' public images. A running gag in the sketches is that Mort Mort is extremely short of stature. In one installment of the sketch he displays a photo of himself with his good friend, Danny DeVito that has been digitally manipulated to make Andy Samberg (in character as Mort Mort) appear to be several inches shorter than DeVito. The illusion of shortness is achieved in the live sketch via very simple forced perspective (mainly, Samberg is seated behind a normal-height desk on an unseen extremely low chair).|$|R
40|$|On your one-minute {{walk from}} the coffee <b>machine</b> to your <b>desk</b> each morning, you pass by dozens of scenes – a kitchen, an elevator, your office – and you {{effortlessly}} recognize them and perceive their 3 D structure. But this one-minute scene-understanding problem has been an open challenge in computer vision since the field was first established 50 years ago. In this dissertation, we aim to rethink the path researchers took over these years, challenge the standard practices and implicit assumptions in the current research, and redefine several basic principles in computational scene understanding. The key idea of this dissertation is that learning from rich data under natural setting is crucial for finding the right representation for scene understanding. First of all, to overcome the limitations of object-centric datasets, we built the Scene Understanding (SUN) Database, a large collection of real-world images that exhaustively spans all scene categories. This scene-centric dataset provides a more natural sample of human visual world, and establishes a realistic benchmark for standard 2 D recognition tasks. However, while an image is a 2 D array, the world is 3 D and our eyes see it from a viewpoint, but this is no...|$|R

40|$|The {{software}} infrastructure used on Volunteered Distributed Computing is evolving {{to meet the}} diverse needs of researchers. These emerging systems are being built using Open Source tools. We describe a number of such systems {{in the context of}} this emerging field. Throughout this paper we revisit concepts presented in the April 2004 paper entitled, “Tapping the Matrix”. 1. Machines are underutilized Modern machines are capable of executing billions of instructions in the time it takes us to blink. This fact may be less surprising when we consider that the typical machine’s sold today feature processors running at multiple gigahertz supported by hundreds of megabytes of main memory. Surprisingly, the vast majority of personal computers are underutilized. The truth is many machines are idle for as much as 90 % of an entire day. Even when active, most applications utilize fewer than 10 % percent of the machines CPU. Furthermore, this trend shows no signs of reversing, in fact, conservative estimates indicate that there are roughly 800 million personal computers in use. About 150 million are Internet connected machines which are expected to increase to one billion by 2015 [2] It is an observable fact that the vast majority of the desktop computers found in businesses, universities and homes are largely idle.

However, while an image is a 2 D array, the world is 3 D and our eyes see it from a viewpoint, {{but this is not}} traditionally modeled. To obtain a 3 D understanding at high-level, we reintroduce geometric figures using modern machinery. To model scene viewpoint, we propose a panoramic place representation to go beyond aperture computer vision and use data that is close to natural input for human visual system. This paradigm shift toward rich representation also opens up new challenges that require a new kind of big data - data with extra descriptions, namely rich data. Specifically, we focus on a highly valuable kind of rich data - multiple viewpoints in 3 D - and we build the SUN 3 D database to obtain an integrated place-centric representation of scenes. We argue for the great importance of modeling the computer's role as an agent in a 3 D scene, and demonstrate the power of place-centric scene representation. by Jianxiong Xiao. Thesis (Ph. D.)
