This paper describes a number of physical phenomena associated with EMAT generation under pulsed-magnetic-field bias. In particular, {{it is observed that}} for maximum transduction efficiencies the ultrasonic pulse must be retarded relative to the initiation of the current pulse to the electromagnet windings. A second maximum in the transduction efficiency is observed when the pulsed magnet-EMAT system is operated on ferromagnetic steel (1020).

40|$|To {{describe}} and simulate dynamic micromagnetic phenomena, we consider a coupled {{system of the}} nonlinear Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and the conservation of momentum equation. This coupling allows one to include <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>effects</b> into the simulations. Existence of weak solutions has recently been shown in Carbou et al.

In our contribution, we give an alternate proof which additionally provides an effective numerical integrator. The latter is based on linear finite elements (FEs) in space and a linear-implicit Euler time-stepping. Despite the nonlinearity, only two linear systems have to be solved per timestep, and the integrator fully decouples both equations. Finally, we prove unconditional convergence—at least of a subsequence—towards, and hence existence of, a weak solution of the coupled system, as timestep size and spatial mesh size tend to zero.

40|$|We {{report on}} the tuning of {{permittivity}} and permeability of a ferroelectric/ferromagnetic bilayer structure {{which can be used}} as a microwavephase shifter with two degrees of tuning freedom. The structure was prepared by the growth of a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) layer on a gadolinium gallium garnet substrate by liquid phase epitaxy, the growth of a barium strontium titanate (BST) layer on the YIG layer through pulsed laser deposition, and then the fabrication of a coplanar waveguide on the top of BST through e-beam evaporation and trilayer liftoff techniques. The phase shifters exhibit a differential phase shift of 38 °/cm at 6 GHz through permittivity tuning under an applied electric field of ∼ 75  kV/cm and a static magnetic field of 1700 Oe. By tuning the permeability through the applied magnetic field we increase the differential phase shift to 52 °/cm and simultaneously obtain a better match to the zero applied electric field condition, resulting in an improvement in the return loss from 22. 4 to 24. 9 dB. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of a lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) layer to tune the permeability of the YIG layer. This tuning relies on the piezoelectric and <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>effects</b> of PMN-PT and YIG, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{understand}} the mechanism responsible for the exceptionally high magnetostriction exhibited by the heavy rare earths. Magnetostriction constants λ(^ɤ, 2),λ(^ɑ, 2) and λ(_ 1) (^ɑ, 2) of order ȴ = 2 for gadolinium, terbium and their alloys were measured using a resistive strain gauge technique. The temperature dependence of these magnetostriction constants was observed from liquid helium temperature to close to their Curie temperatures for Gd, 90 %Gd- 10 %Tb, 70 %Gd- 30 %Tb, 507 oGd- 50 %Tb, 10 %Gd- 90 %Tb and Tb. The adequacy of theoretical predictions of the temperature dependence was tested with the results of these measurements. The observed temperature dependence of λ(^ɤ, 2) over the entire range of temperature and alloy compositions except for pure Gd, was found to follow closely the variation predicted by a theory termed as a single-ion model. The same conclusion resulted from the measurements of λ(_ 2) (^ɑ, 2) and λ(_ 1) (^ɑ, 2) but with less reliability. The extrapolated values of the constants at OK for Gd and its experimental temperature dependence are consistent with results of other investigations on gadolinium. The magnetostriction constants of the alloys varied linearly with the terbium concentration, again showing that the single-ion magnetocrystalline interaction is principally responsible for the <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>effects</b> due to terbium ions.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2009 In acoustics, {{pulse echo}} methods {{are well known}} {{as a means of}} {{measuring}} time of Hight. Traditional techniques for generating acoustic waves in solid ferromagnetic waveguides include piezoelectric, capacitive and magnetostriction. Piezoelectric and capacitive techniques are preferred due to the inefficiency of magnetostriction caused by electro-mechanical coupling losses and the fact that most ferromagnetic materials show low levels of magnetostriction. The aim {{of this study was to}} optimise the <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>effects</b> for sensing applications based on a ferromagnetic waveguide using the pulse echo method. The results obtained were implemented in the design of an acoustic thermometer. Two configurations for signal generation and recovery were examined, the use of a single wound copper coil acting as a transceiver coil, and the use of separate transmit and receive coils. Results obtained using the latter configuration indicated better signal to noise ratio's and provided the flexibility to manipulate the point of signal recovery. The pulse echo method was implemented and optimised. An acoustic thermometer based on an existing design was developed by inducing a partial reflection from a set position in the waveguide, defining a sensing probe. Awareness of the elastic properties of the waveguide material enabled the guaging of its temperature by measuring the acoustic pulse velocity in the probe. The accuracy of the instrument was increased through signal conditioning, examined together with cross correlation and an increased sampling frequency.

40|$|FeCoV/TiNx and FeCoV/Ti multilayers having t(FeCoV) = 30 - 700 Angstrom {{prepared}} by dc magnetron sputtering are investigated by x-ray diffraction, stress, and magnetization measurements. The x-ray diffraction {{data of the}} FeCoV/TiNx system show the presence of interstitial N atoms in the FeCoV layers due to reactive sputtering of Ti with nitrogen. The interstitial N causes {{an expansion of the}} FeCoV lattice in FeCoV/TiNx for small t(FeCoV). However, for the samples with large t(FeCoV), no lattice expansion is observed. In addition to the lattice expansion caused by the intake of N atoms, a change in the crystalline texture of FeCoV layers is also observed as indicated by the enhancement of the FeCoV(200) peaks. The magnetic hysteresis measurements on the samples show that the easy direction of magnetization lies in the plane of the layers. They further show that there are easy and hard axes of magnetization within the plane of the FeCoV layers. The stress anisotropy present in the plane of the samples induces a magnetic anisotropy through <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>effects</b> leading to the formation of the in- plane easy axis. The hysteresis and stress measurements carried out on these samples clearly show the influence of N on the in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The magnetoelastic energy {{in the case of the}} FeCoV/TiNx system, calculated from the stress data and from the magnetization measurements as a function of t(FeCoV) is found to agree over a large range of thickness, whereas the curves deviate significantly for small layer thickness. This deviation may be due to the role of the FeCoVNx phase. Hysteresis measurements also show that the remanence is about 95 % for all the samples of the FeCoV/TiNx system. In contrast, the coercivity increases linearly with increasing t(FeCoV) in this system. The coercivity of the FeCoV/Ti system is larger and increases more rapidly with t(FeCoV), as compared with the FeCoV/TiNx system. This behavior is attributed to a smaller grain size in the FeCoV/TiNx system due to the reactive sputtering of the Ti layers. However, there is no significant influence of N on the saturation magnetization of both systems. (C) 200...|$|R
