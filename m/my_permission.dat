500|$|According to Cinema Vision India, the film's {{theme is}} [...] "that people change [...] and they must". Ramachandran notes that when Kali's arm is amputated, he feels {{helpless}} and emasculated; Kumaran, his , becomes an easy target, adding that Kali refuses {{to see the}} benefits of his sister marrying a wealthy, educated man (even when Valli and his wife Manga ask for his consent), but sees the error of his ways when Valli abandons her defiant wedding preparations to join her brother: [...] "My sister has shown all of you that I am {{the most important person}} in her life. I need only that happiness for the rest of my life. And it is with that pride and arrogance that I give <b>my</b> <b>permission</b> for my sister to marry." ...|$|E
500|$|Bakshi {{is quoted}} as saying that he had [...] "mixed feeling" [...] about Jackson's adaptations, {{although}} he had not seen the films. [...] "In some respects I feel good that Peter Jackson continued and went on, and in some respects I feel bad that Saul Zaentz, the producer, and various people never called me, thanked me, or asked <b>my</b> <b>permission</b> to do the movie. [...] has anyone sent me a bottle of wine, on the tremendous success. [...] But I have more feelings on the business side of that than I do on the creative side. I'm glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at—I never did. And certainly there's a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works. So he had a little easier time than I did, and a lot better budget." ...|$|E

500|$|Although many of Davidson's parishioners {{accepted}} that his London rescue mission was entirely honourable, some, including Major Hamond, were less convinced. Hamond was {{suspicious of the}} stream of visitors that Davidson brought to the Stiffkey rectory and thought he was neglecting his parochial duties. In 1927 {{relations between the two}} men worsened when Davidson, in a letter which Tucker describes as [...] "breathless in its rudeness and insensitivity", upbraided the major for clearing the ground in the Morston churchyard alongside his recently deceased wife's grave: [...] "Morston Churchyard is the private freehold property of the Rector of Morston... you have no possible right to interfere with it in any way without <b>my</b> <b>permission</b> any more than I have the right to come and annex a part of your garden." [...] On one occasion, Davidson arrived late at Morston to officiate at a communion service, having forgotten the bread and wine; enraged, Hamond ordered him back to the rectory to collect it. An even greater lapse, in Hamond's eyes, was Davidson's failure to return to Stiffkey in time to officiate at the 1930 Armistice Day ceremony at the local war memorial.|$|E
500|$|Stalmaster {{convinced}} Donner and Ilya to have Reeve screen test in February 1977. Reeve {{stunned the}} director and producers, but {{he was told to}} wear a [...] "muscle suit" [...] to produce the desired muscular physique. Reeve refused, undertaking a strict physical exercise regime headed by David Prowse. Prowse had wanted to portray Superman, but was denied an audition by the filmmakers because he was not American. Prowse also auditioned for Non. Reeve went from 188 to 212 pounds during pre-production and filming. Reeve was paid a mere $250,000 for both Superman and Superman II, while his veteran co-stars received huge sums of money: $3.7 million for Brando and $2 million for Hackman for Superman I. However, Reeve felt, [...] "'Superman' brought me many opportunities, rather than closing a door in my face." [...] Jeff East portrays teenage Clark Kent. East's lines were overdubbed by Reeve during post-production. [...] "I was not happy about it because the producers never told me what they had in mind," [...] East commented. [...] "It was done without <b>my</b> <b>permission</b> {{but it turned out to}} be okay. Chris did a good job but it caused tension between us. We resolved our issues with each other years later." [...] East also tore several thigh muscles when performing the stunt of racing alongside the train. He applied 3 to 4 hours of prosthetic makeup daily to facially resemble Reeve.|$|E

[...] "Shortly after I sent the book for review", he writes, [...] "a very worried journal editor contacted me. He was upset that I hadn't included a copyright page on the e-book I sent him.

2500|$|Green also interviewed Georgia State Prosecutor Dan Duke, whom he {{reported}} as denying having worked with Kennedy {{as closely as}} the latter had claimed. [...] "Duke agreed that Kennedy 'got inside of some [...] meetings' but openly disputed Kennedy's dramatized account of their relationship. 'None of that happened,' [...] told Green", according to Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt in their New York Times Magazine column of January 8, 2006. Peggy Bulger, on the other hand, stated that when she interviewed Duke, {{he reported}}ly found {{the way it was}} written amusing the way it was written and: [...] " [...] Duke laughed about the way The Klan Unmasked was written. But he added that Kennedy 'didn't do it all, but he did plenty,' she said.

Jim Clark and Ben Green collaborated on the script of Freedom Never Dies: The Story of Harry T. Moore, based on Green's book and partially funded by the Freedom Forum. In a letter to Kennedy dated July 27, 1946, Georgia Governor Ellis Arnall wrote: 'You have <b>my</b> <b>permission</b> to quote me as making the following observation: Documentary evidence uncovered by Stetson Kennedy has facilitated Georgia's prosecution of the Ku Klux Klan.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|José Nicolau da Fonseca has {{recorded}} that Diogo Rodrigues died in Colvá, Gôa and was buried inside this mother church (Matriz) of Salcette {{of which he}} was the Captain of the fort at that time called Igreja da Nossa Senhora de Neves at Rachol with his grave's inscription reading: Aqui jaz Diogo Rodrigues o do Forte, Capitão desta Fortaleza, O qual derrubou os pagodes destas terras. Falleceu a 21 de Abril de 1577 annos. In English translation this reads: [...] "Here lies Diogo Rodrigues (called) 'O do Forte/ Captain of this Fortress, who destroyed the pagodas of these territories. He died on the 21st April of the year 1577." [...] The grave inscription stone and his relics are still inside the church, near the altar of Igreja da Nossa Senhora de Neves from 1577. [...] Hindu pagodas of Salcette in Goa were destroyed by Diego who personally oversaw this destruction in 1567. This led to the mass exodus of Hindus from the Portuguese held territories and the Hindus taking the idols of their deities across the Zuari river to the territories of the Hindu Sonde Kings. Amongst the temples destroyed are the temples of Shri Ramnathi, Shree Shantadurga and Shree Mangeshi. Also destroyed were nine pagodas in the village of Margão (Mathagrama) by Diogo, who was rewarded with the revenues of the lands belonging to them the destruction was triggered when a Jesuit was attacked and when the community of Loutolim disobeyed Diogo Rodrigues, the then Captain of the Fort of Rachol as he had called the residents of the village of Lotoulim for a meeting, but they did not turn up. As a punishment to them, he burnt down the temple of Ramnath. The villagers filed a case with Capitão às Justiças de sua Magestad in Goa. The magistrate ordered the Captain to rebuild the temple. With the support of the Archbishop Primaz and the Provincial Council, the Captain obtained an Order from the Viceroy to burn down en masse the temples of Salcete, consequently the viceroy: Dom António de Noronha (1564–1568) {{at the request of the}} Archbishop and the Jesuits ordered Diogo Rodrigues to burn down all the remaining temples he found in Salcette, the viceroy also issued a decree in December 1565 forbidding the erection of new temples and the repairs of the existing ones, this was as stated: [...] "I hereby order that in any area owned by my master, the King, nobody should construct a Hindu temple and such temples already constructed should not be repaired without <b>my</b> <b>permission.</b> If this order is transgressed, such temples shall be, destroyed and the goods in them shall be used to meet expenses of holy deeds, as punishment of such transgression." [...] Diogo Rodrigues was also known as [...] "O do Forte", In English: [...] "Of the Strong", the Captain of Salcette who ordered the destruction of the temples of Assolna, Ambelim, Velim, Veroda, Cuncolim and Talvorda, when the villagers failed to obey some of his orders. The property and income of the temples were given to the church authorities. The exact date when the Captain Diogo Rodrigues descended upon the temple of Malsa devi (to be converted into a Church of Our Lady of Conception in future) [...] in all fury was on 7 March 1567 just at the time when the priest was about to bedeck the idol of Mahalasa with silver ornaments. Those ornaments were confiscated along with other valuables of the temple and a proper inventory of the movables was made, then began the act of destruction. The image in the sanctum sanctorum was broken to pieces allegedly because Fr. Luis Goes had denounced her as a ‘bad woman’. The villagers managed to spirit away other idols. Sacred books and works of art that enhanced the beauty of this temple together with the roof were ruthlessly destroyed. The Captain retreated after planting a Cross at the most prominent spot at the site. The details of the destruction of this temple are to be found in the Report of Irmão Gomes Vaz dated December 12, 1567 which notes that the temple was totally destroyed on March 14, 1567. Diego Rodrigues took toll of 280 temples in Salcette alone. The cults from those temples were shifted mainly to the New Conquest areas where, the Desais and the Sardesais, the feudal lords of Sultan Adil Shaha of Bijapur, being Hindus themselves, took it as their holy duty to facilitate creation of new abodes for the said cults.|$|E
