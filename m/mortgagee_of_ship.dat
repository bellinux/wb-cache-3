50|$|The {{progress}} of this extension {{was stopped by}} a dispute between the South Devon Railway Company and the <b>mortgagee</b> in possession <b>of</b> the Dartmoor Railway, a line 24 miles long, constructed in 1820. This railway was crossed on the level at right angles by the South Devon line. The mortgagee not getting the terms he asked from the South Devon Railway, brought immense blocks of granite from his Dartmoor quarries, and deposited them on the line where the South Devon wished to cross. This effectually prevented the railway from proceeding with the line and they soon arranged a compromise, which had the desired effect, the granite blocks being then removed by the <b>mortgagee</b> <b>of</b> the Dartmoor Railway.|$|R

Moosa, a Moghul, also indirectly benefitted from the British suppression of Hindu rule in Malabar, as cultural imperatives had, at times, been an impediment with certain non-Muslims.|$|R

50|$|The Act {{attempted}} to remedy this evil by restricting {{the right of}} landlords to eject their tenants and prevented them from raising the rent except for limited purposes. At the same time, in fairness to the landlords, <b>mortgagees</b> <b>of</b> houses controlled by the Act were prevented from increasing the rate of interest and restricted in their rights to enforce the security. This was the first comprehensive European enactment controlling rent; since then many other Acts have been passed in Great Britain, and of course, in other European countries.|$|R

60|$|Naturally, therefore, when {{it became}} known that such redoubtable heads {{as those of the}} {{trustees}} and the underlying <b>mortgagees</b> <b>of</b> St. Asaph's were being put together, it was fully expected that some important development would follow. It was not accurately known from which of the assembled heads first proceeded the great idea which was presently to solve the difficulties of the church. It may well have come from that of Mr. Lucullus Fyshe. Certainly a head which had brought peace out of civil war in the hardware business by amalgamating ten rival stores and had saved the very lives of five hundred employees by reducing their wages fourteen per cent, was capable of it.|$|R
40|$|In 2007 and 2008 {{there were}} a series of cases in New South Wales, and two cases in Queensland, dealing with the {{enforceability}} of registered mortgages where the mortgagor’s (purported) execution of the instrument had been forged. In none of these cases was the mortgagee found to have been guilty of fraud, which meant that the mortgagee obtained an indefeasible interest in the relevant land. However, as Campbell J has pointed out, ‘[n]otwithstanding that registration confers indefeasibility on a mortgagee, {{there is still a}} question “indefeasibility for what?”’. This article examines the consequences for the mortgagor and the mortgagee following the registration, without fraud on the part <b>of</b> the <b>mortgagee,</b> <b>of</b> a mortgage where the mortgagor’s execution has been forged...|$|R
50|$|In a ship mortgage, a {{shipowner}} gives {{a lender}} (or mortgagee) {{an interest in}} a ship as security for a loan. Similar to other types <b>of</b> mortgage, a <b>ship</b> mortgage legally consists of three parts: the mortgage loan, the mortgage document (deed) and the rights derived from the mortgage deed onto money lender. Ship mortgages differ from other types of mortgage in three ways. First, some privileged claims could have a higher ranking over that <b>of</b> <b>mortgagee</b> against the <b>ship.</b> Second, ships naturally move between jurisdictions. And third, a ship is always at risk of partial or total damages at sea. The use <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> mortgages emerged as a widely accepted practice in shipping industry in the 19th century as a major source <b>of</b> finance for <b>ship</b> owners.|$|R

"Well, {{though as}} I said just now, the <b>mortgagees</b> <b>of</b> an estate {{as a body}} are merely a {{business}} corporation, and look at things from a business point of view only, you must remember that they are composed of individuals, and that individuals can be influenced {{if they can be}} got at. For instance, Cossey and Son are an abstraction and harshly disposed in their abstract capacity, but Mr. Edward Cossey is an individual, and I should say, so far as this particular matter is concerned, a benevolently disposed individual. Now Mr. Edward Cossey is not himself at the present moment actually one of the firm of Cossey and Son, but he is the heir of the head of the house, and of course has authority, and, what is better still, the command of money." ...|$|R
40|$|In the mid- 1990 s, {{mortgage}} bankers created Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) {{to escape}} {{the costs associated with}} recording mortgage transfers. To accomplish this, lenders permanently list MERS as the <b>mortgagee</b> <b>of</b> record instead of themselves to avoid the expense of recording any subsequent transfers. MERS’s claim that it is both an agent of the lender and the mortgagee, and the huge gaps left in the public record, give rise to a range of legal issues. This Article addresses whether security agreements naming MERS as a mortgagee meet traditional conveyance requirements and discusses the rights of counties to recover unpaid recording fees. The author explores the challenges facing judges, legislators, county recorders, and investors who must resolve these issues to rebuild confidence in real property recording systems...|$|R
60|$|Herein lay {{the truth}} about the Duke of Dulham's visit and the error of Mr. Lucullus Fyshe. Mr. Fyshe was {{thinking}} that the Duke had come to lend money. In reality he had come to borrow it. In fact, the Duke was reckoning that by putting a second mortgage on Dulham Towers for twenty thousand sterling, and by selling his Scotch shooting and leasing his Irish grazing and sub-letting his Welsh coal rent he could raise altogether a hundred thousand pounds. This for a duke, is an enormous sum. If he once had it {{he would be able to}} pay off the first mortgage on Dulham Towers, buy in the rights of the present tenant of the Scotch shooting and the claim <b>of</b> the present <b>mortgagee</b> <b>of</b> the Irish grazing, and in fact be just where he started. This is ducal finance, which moves always in a circle.|$|R
50|$|A {{mortgage}} bond, as per Thienhaus v Metje & Ziegler, is {{an instrument}} of hypothecation, {{a record of the}} mortgage agreement, a record of the principal debt and a debt instrument. It establishes the <b>mortgagee’s</b> right <b>of</b> mortgage (ius hypothecarium). Registration does not depend on the validity of the underlying causa, as South Africa applies the abstract system of transfer of real rights.|$|R
2500|$|Title {{insurers}} {{conduct a}} title search on public records before {{they agree to}} insure the purchaser or <b>mortgagee</b> <b>of</b> land. [...] Specifically, after a real estate sales contract has been executed and escrow opened, a title professional will search the public records to look for any problems with the home's title. This search typically involves a review of land records going back many years. More than one-third of all title searches reveal a title problem that title professionals will insist on fixing before the transaction closes. For instance, a previous owner may have had minor construction done on the property, but never fully paid the contractor (resulting in a mechanic's lien), or the previous owner may have failed to pay local or state taxes (resulting in a tax lien). Title professionals seek to resolve problems like these before the transaction closes, since otherwise, their employer, the title insurer, {{will be required to}} fix such title defects by paying such unpaid fees or taxes.|$|R

50|$|Although the Roman Catholic Ferdinand I {{was able}} to win back the abbey lordship in the Schmalkaldic War and reincorporate it into Lower Lusatia, he too kept the monks from returning, and instead mortgaged the {{extensive}} territory to several members in turn of the noble families of Schlick and Gersdorff. Heinrich von Gersdorff in about 1550 had a hunting lodge built to replace the abbot's house. The last owner of the nobility, Heinrich Anselm von Promnitz, sold Dobrilugk in 1624 to Johann Georg of Saxony, who shortly before had become the <b>mortgagee</b> <b>of</b> the whole of Lower Lusatia. The Lower Lusatian parliament had however been able to bring it about that the abbatial territory remained part of the margravate. So the curious situation arose that the lordship of Dobrilugk belonged administratively both to Lower Lusatia and Kursachsen. Subjects paid their taxes into the Lower Lusatia exchequer, but answered to the justice of the officials of the Saxon Elector, appeal from which could only {{be made to the}} Chamber Court in Dresden and no longer to the Lower Lusatia State Court.|$|R
40|$|To {{simplify the}} {{title to land}} and {{facilitate}} the transfer thereof must always be a subject of much interest in this country, where so large a proportion of {{the wealth of the}} inhabitants consists of land. I will therefore offer no apology for bringing under the notice of the Society this evening the Report (dated 24 th June, 1879) of the Select Committee appointed to enquire and report whether any and what steps ought to be taken to simplify the title to land, and to facilitate the transfer thereof, and to prevent frauds on purchasers and <b>mortgagees</b> <b>of</b> land; and also the First Report (dated 12 th August, 1879) of Her Majesty 2 ̆ 7 s Commissioners appointed to inquire into the law relating to the registration of deeds and assurances in Ireland. The labours of both these bodies extended over the greater part of the years 1878 and 1879, and have produced important proposals for the amendment of the law. The Select Committee treated the question principally as it affected England; the Royal Commission viewed it exclusively in its relation to Ireland...|$|R

The court found itself constrained by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine to give effect to a prior state-court judgment of foreclosure, but went on to consider several arguments MERS advanced about its legal status and authority, noting that it had held off on deciding dozens of additional cases until those matters were clarified. The court found that MERS had no power as an agent to assign the mortgage under its rules, its membership agreement, or the terms of the mortgage itself. The court also found that MERS had no power as the <b>mortgagee</b> <b>of</b> record to assign the mortgage: [...] "MERS's position that that it can be both the mortgagee and an agent <b>of</b> the <b>mortgagee</b> is absurd, at best." ...|$|R
