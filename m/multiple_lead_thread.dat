40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} Fastpath, {{a system}} for speculative parallelization of sequential programs on conventional multicore processors. Our system distinguishes between the <b>lead</b> <b>thread,</b> which executes at almostnative speed, and speculative threads, which execute somewhat slower. This allows us to achieve nontrivial speedup, even on two-core machines. We present a mathematical model of potential speedup, parameterized by application characteristics and implementation constants. We also present preliminary results gleaned from two different Fastpath implementations, each derived from an implementation of software transactional memory. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} the valuation performances of seven multiples on {{a sample of}} BSE-listed firms. When industry membership is used as the selection method for compa-rable firms, the P/CF <b>multiple</b> <b>leads</b> to the best valuation performance. P/E, P/B, P/CF and P/TA multiples assure the highest accuracies when ROE is used as the selection method for comparable firms. In the case of both selection methods of comparables, the P/S <b>multiple</b> <b>leads</b> to the least accurate valuation. In this study, accuracy levels of multiple valuations are generally lower than those obtained using the same methods on more developed capital markets. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} enhance design {{reliability}} of a co-rotating twin screw pulping extruder (TSPE), optimum design on screw {{parameters of the}} TSPE was studied based on the extrusion model. The maximum shear flux or the minimum power consumption, or the two synchronous optimizations were taken as objective functions, and constraint conditions, such as <b>thread</b> <b>lead,</b> depth of <b>thread,</b> screw rotational speed, number of reverse <b>thread</b> <b>lead,</b> actual top width of the flight, torsional strength and stiffness of the screw mandrel, and so on were confirmed base on actual requirements of the TSPE manufacture and application.

40|$|A 76 -year-old man {{developed}} superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) 20 {{months after}} the implantation of a dual chamber pacemaker, and was successfully treated with thrombolytic therapy followed by long-term anticoagulant therapy. The face and neck were markedly swollen, and superficial veins in the neck, upper arms and upper chest were prominently distended. Venography from bilateral cubital veins revealed a severe stenosis of the distal segment of the superior vena cava without the development of collateral channels. After an initial treatment with urokinase for 5 days followed by warfarin for 16 months, the symptoms and signs of the SVCS disappeared, and the digital subtraction angiography revealed a marked regression of the thrombotic stenosis. In view of the expected increase in the insertion of <b>multiple</b> <b>leads</b> in cases of dual chamber pacemakers or including fractured lead retention, more attention should {{be paid to the}} risk of the development of the SVCS in these cases.

40|$|Advanced age alone {{appears to}} be a risk factor for {{increased}} susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias. We previously observed in the aged rat heart that sinus rhythm ventricular activation is delayed and characterized by abnormal epicardial patterns although conduction velocity is normal. While these findings relate to an advanced stage of aging, it is not yet known when and how ventricular electrical impairment originates and which is the underlying substrate. To address these points, we performed continuous telemetry ECG recordings in freely moving rats over a six-month period to monitor ECG waveform changes, heart rate variability and the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias. At the end of the study, we performed in-vivo <b>multiple</b> <b>lead</b> epicardial recordings and histopathology of cardiac tissue. We found that the duration of ECG waves and intervals gradually increased and heart rate variability gradually decreased with age. Moreover, the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias gradually increased, with atrial arrhythmias exceeding ventricular arrhythmias. Epicardial <b>multiple</b> <b>lead</b> recordings confirmed abnormalities in ventricular activation patterns, likely attributable to distal conducting system dysfunctions. Microscopic analysis of aged heart specimens revealed multifocal connective tissue deposition and perinuclear myocytolysis in the atria. Our results demonstrate that aging gradually modifies the terminal part of the specialized cardiac conducting system, creating a substrate for increased arrhythmogenesis. These findings may open ne...|$|R
40|$|High T(sub c) superconducting {{thick film}} was {{prepared}} by screen printing process. Y-based (YBa 2 Cu 3 O(7 - x)) superconducting thick films were printed on 211 /Al 2 O 3, SNT/Al 2 O 3, and YSZ substrates. Because of poor adhesion of the superconducting thick films to 211 /Al 2 O 3 and SNT/Al 2 O 3 substrates, relatively low T(sub c) and J(sub c) values {{were obtained from}} the films printed on these substrates. Critical temperatures of YBa 2 Cu 3 O(7 - x) thick films deposited on 211 /Al 2 O 3 and SNT/Al 2 O 3 substrates were about 80 K. The critical current densities of these films were less than 2 A/cm(exp 2).
