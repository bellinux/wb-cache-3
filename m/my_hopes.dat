Franklin looking towards the Presidents Chair, {{at the back}} of which a rising sun {{happened}} to be painted, observed to a few members near him, that Painters had found it difficult to distinguish in their art a rising from a setting sun. I have said he, often and often {{in the course of the}} Session, and the vicissitudes of <b>my</b> <b>hopes</b> and fears as to its issue, looked at that behind the President without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting: But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting Sun.|$|E
5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, <b>my</b> <b>hopes</b> have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

500|$|Politically, the {{new king}} {{took steps to}} {{conclude}} the protracted constitutional deliberations of the Assembly. On 19 October 1864, he sent the Assembly a demand, countersigned by Constantine Kanaris, explaining that he had accepted the crown on the understanding that a new constitution would be finalized, and {{that if it was}} not he would feel himself at [...] "perfect liberty to adopt such measures as the disappointment of <b>my</b> <b>hopes</b> may suggest". It was unclear from the wording whether he meant to return to Denmark or impose a constitution, but as either event was undesirable the Assembly soon came to an agreement.|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} to New York, Cornwallis applied to Clinton for leave {{to return to}} England, where his wife was ill. [...] Clinton, believing Cornwallis was well positioned to influence the political leadership to gain additional troops for the war effort, granted the leave, and Cornwallis returned to England in December 1778. [...] Although he spent some time pleading Clinton's case, his wife's illness distracted him. [...] Finding her in [...] "a very weak state indeed", he stayed with her until she died on February 14, 1779. [...] Cornwallis was devastated by the loss, reporting that her death had [...] "effectually destroyed all <b>my</b> <b>hopes</b> of happiness in this world." [...] He eventually {{decided to return to}} service in April 1779; in a letter to Clinton he offered to serve either in the southern colonies or the West Indies.|$|E

500|$|Reimer was {{selected}} by the Red Deer Rebels in the fifth round of the 2003 Western Hockey League (WHL) Bantam Draft, with a pick that originally belonged to the Spokane Chiefs. The team drafted Reimer largely on the word of a single scout, Carter Sears. [...] After Reimer performed poorly during his first training camp with the club, Rebels head coach Brent Sutter wanted to release him, but Sears was persistent in his support for Reimer. Reimer made the club in his third attempt after having been cut the previous two seasons. [...] His first season in the WHL was a poor one for the Rebels. [...] Reimer played 34 games, recording only 7 wins. [...] Reimer broke his hand late in the season, an injury which cost {{him a chance to}} play for Team Canada at the 2006 IIHF World U18 Championships. [...] Reimer {{was selected}} by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the fourth round (99th overall) of the 2006 National Hockey League (NHL) Entry Draft. [...] John Ferguson, Jr., the Maple Leafs general manager at the time, remembers Reimer as an unfinished product needing time to develop, being [...] "somewhat raw". [...] At the time of the draft, Reimer was preparing for his high school graduation, and did not attend the event in Vancouver, British Columbia. [...] He said, [...] "I made a decision not to pay a lot of attention because I was reluctant to get <b>my</b> <b>hopes</b> too high." [...] His agent, Ray Petkau, called with the news about being drafted and later brought him his Maple Leafs jersey and hat that draftees receive. [...] Prior to the draft, Reimer had mentioned {{that he would like to}} be drafted by the Los Angeles Kings, saying [...] "I'd love to play hockey in all that sunshine." ...|$|E
500|$|Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode an A– grade. In a season review, Michelle Kung from Entertainment Weekly called the episode [...] "worthy", but {{noted that it}} was overshadowed by the show's [...] "ludicrous {{conspiracy}} plots". Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk concluded that [...] "Release" [...] was a [...] "good episode" [...] because it [...] "presented conclusions to [...] long running stories in the series [...] featured the conclusion to John Doggett's personal trial, his quest for closure with his son's murder." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two argued that, because of the [...] "minimal emphasis" [...] Doggett's son's murder was given in the show, the episode [...] "packs [...] punch". Shearman and Pearson saw similarities between Doggett's trials and those of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). They noted that while [...] "Mulder was always identified by his quest for his sister [...] ", Doggett [...] "carried {{the loss of his}} son as a private grief." [...] They concluded that this structuring made the entry [...] "emotionally powerful" [...] and [...] "moving". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, complimented the [...] "lyrical style" [...] of the episode, calling it [...] "gorgeously shot" [...] and [...] "well acted". Other reviews were not as glowing. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a negative review and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode made about as much sense as 'Underneath' or 'Jump the Shark'. It was entirely inappropriate for John Doggett’s struggle to end with someone else’s actions. If this is the way the series is going to end, then I have to say, <b>my</b> <b>hopes</b> for a rousing finale are dwindling." ...|$|E

2500|$|Slash was {{replaced}} by Nine Inch Nails touring guitarist Robin Finck in January 1997, who signed a two-year contract with the band in August 1997, making him an official member. Finck was originally recommended by Matt Sorum to Rose a year earlier as a possible second guitarist to complement Slash. Slash's departure was followed shortly thereafter by Matt Sorum in April 1997, who was fired by Rose after getting in an argument about Tobias's inclusion in the band. Sorum later stated Tobias was the [...] "Yoko Ono of Guns N' Roses". McKagan {{was the last of}} the Appetite lineup to leave, resigning as bassist in August 1997. McKagan had recently become a father and wrote about his decision to leave in his autobiography, stating [...] "Guns had been paying rent on studios for three years now—from 1994 to 1997—and still did not have a single song. The whole operation was so erratic that it didn't seem to fit with <b>my</b> <b>hopes</b> for parenthood, for stability." [...] McKagan {{was replaced}} later that year by former Replacements bassist Tommy Stinson. An actual break-up of Guns N' Roses never occurred, as new players were brought in as the old ones left. Rose reportedly purchased the full rights to the Guns N' Roses name in 1997. Slash claimed he and bandmates signed over the name in duress, stating [...] "Axl refused to go onstage one night during the Use Your Illusion tour in 1992 unless the band signed away the name rights to the band. Unfortunately, we signed it. I didn't think he'd go on stage otherwise." [...] Rose denied the claim, saying [...] "(it) Never happened, all made up, fallacy and fantasy. Not one single solitary thread of truth to it. Had that been the case I would have been cremated years ago legally, could've cleaned me out for the name and damages. It's called under duress with extenuating circumstances." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 8 March 1932, Puyi {{made his}} {{ceremonial}} entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng who was beaming with joy, Amakasu whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable. Puyi remembered about {{his first time}} in Changchun: [...] "I saw Japanese gendarmes, and rows of people, wearing all sots of clothes; some were in Chinese jackets and gowns, some were in Western suits and some in traditional Japanese dress, {{and they were all}} holding small flags in their hands. I was thrilled and reflected that I was now seeing the scene that I missed at the harbor. As I walked past them Hsi Hsia [...] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu [...] "bannermen" [...] who had been waiting for me to come for twenty years. These words brought tears to my eyes, and I was more strongly convinced than ever that my future was very hopeful". Puyi also noted he was [...] "too preoccupied with <b>my</b> <b>hopes</b> and hates" [...] to realize the [...] "cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me". Puyi's friend, the British journalist Woodhead, who covered his arrival in Manchuria, wrote [...] "outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorized by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin [...] "lawless... even its main street unsafe after dark". In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi stated he planned to govern Manchukuo “in the Confucian spirit” and he was “perfectly happy” with his new position. An Italian journalist from the Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote: “I was unable to interview this pale, tired prince who doesn’t’ like to talk, who is always plunged in his meditations and who maybe regrets his life as a simple, studious citizen. He has a fixed stare behind his black-framed glasses. When we were introduced, he responded with a friendly nod. But his smile lasted only a second. We could only await the word of the Master of Ceremonies to give us permission to bow ourselves out. A Japanese colonel, our guide, showed us the triumphal arches, the electric light decorations and endless flags. But all this, say the shopkeepers is [...] "made in Osaka"”.|$|E
