5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and to the group. Buffy <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> face her life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E

All students are eligible to some financial support from the Icelandic Student Loan Fund; the exact amount depends on their financial and personal situation. The student <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> repay this money two years after completing their study programme. In addition to Icelandic students, students from the European Union or EEA-EFTA member states are also eligible to apply for loans, {{if they have been}} working in their trade in the country for at least one year.|$|E
25|$|Consciousness is {{described}} as a state of being, very closely related to God. The consciousness within the normal person is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is consciousness that is subconscious, unconscious, or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of what constitutes the ordinary state of being. A consciousness asleep is caused by what Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions, which all imply a type of consciousness that is not aware of its own processes. It is said that to awaken consciousness one must understand that his or her consciousness is asleep. This implies that one <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> understand every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through the mental discipline of meditation and self-observation. Furthermore, it is stated that the awakening of consciousness {{is the only way to}} acquiring gnosis and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary suffering. The awakening of consciousness goes hand in hand with the transmutation of sexual energy because the higher states of consciousness depend upon the energy of sexual transmutation.|$|E

2500|$|Shoemaker {{advances}} {{the hypothesis}} that Western monks could have learned affective devotion to the Virgin Mary from the significant interactions between Western and Byzantine monastic communities, {{not to mention the}} interest of reform movements in Eastern ascetic practices. [...] For example, before he became abbot of Fécamp, William of Volpiano had been a reforming abbot at St. Benignus in Dijon, where [...] "he received a Greek bishop, Barnabas, into the community, and there were several other Greek monks"; and John of Fécamp received his monastic formation under his uncle at St. Begninus ("Mary at the Cross" [...] 598). [...] In the end, though [...] "we cannot be certain that the affective piety and Marian compassion of the High Middle Ages were Eastern imports, we nonetheless <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> reckon with fact that the emergence of these themes in the eleventh and twelfth centuries was not quite as unprecedented as some have assumed" [...] (Shoemaker, [...] "Mary at the Cross" [...] 606).|$|E

[...] The troubles had become a public relations issue for Diem beyond his country, with speculation about a US-Diệm rift being discussed in American newspapers following the self-immolation. The New York Times ran a front page headline on 14 June, citing leaked government information that diplomats had privately attacked Diem's handling of the crisis. It also reported that General Paul Harkins, {{the head of the}} US advisory mission in South Vietnam to order his men not to assist ARVN units that were taking action against demonstrators. The US at the time considered telling Vice President Tho that they would support him replacing Diem as President. This occurred at the time as the surfacing of rumours that South Vietnamese air force Chief of Staff Lieutenant Colonel Đỗ Khắc Mai had begun gauging support among his colleagues for a coup.|$|E

2500|$|The Stellungsdivisionen held {{sectors that}} were too wide for swift replacement, because of the tempo of British attacks and the Eingreif {{divisions}} [...] <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> swap places to enable frequent reliefs, which would limit the exhaustion of the infantry {{and make sure that}} the troops defending an area were familiar with the ground. The relief system could only apply only to infantry and engineers, because the artillery had been divided into two thirds in emplacements and one third kept mobile in support of counter-attacks. Armin ordered that the new tactics were to apply to Gruppe Staden, Gruppe Ypres and the right flank division of Gruppe Wijtschate. Divisional reliefs should be accomplished in one night; Eingreif divisions were to keep a third of their troops close to the front and the rest in reserve, only to advance to the battlefront after a British attack had started. If the Eingreif troops were needed, then at the minimum, the battalions engaged were to be relieved by fresh troops. The new Vorfeld defence system was to be explained in detail to the troops before they were sent into action. Armin concluded with a warning that more troops were straggling to the rear and that a cordon should be used to prevent soldiers without written authority moving beyond. Punishments for abandoning posts were to be inflicted and announced to the troops.|$|E
2500|$|In his 2006 article [...] "The Richness of Redundancy: Our Mutual Friend," [...] John R. Reed states, [...] "Our Mutual Friend has {{not pleased}} many {{otherwise}} satisfied readers of Dickens's fiction. For his contemporaries and such acute assessors of fiction as Henry James, the novel seemed to lack structure, among other faults. More recently, critics have discovered {{ways in which}} Dickens can be seen experimenting in the novel." [...] Reed maintains that Dickens's establishment of [...] "an incredibly elaborate structure" [...] for Our Mutual Friend was an extension of Dickens's quarrel with realism. In creating a highly formal structure for his novel, which {{called attention to the}} novel's own language, Dickens embraced taboos of realism. Reed also argues that Dickens's employment of his characteristic technique of offering his reader what might be seen as a surplus of information within the novel, {{in the form of a}} pattern of references, exists as a way for Dickens to guarantee that the meaning of his novel might be transmitted to his reader. Reed cites Dickens's multiple descriptions of the River Thames and repetitive likening of Gaffer to [...] "a roused bird of prey" [...] in the novel's first chapter as evidence of Dickens's use of redundancy to establish two of the novel's fundamental themes: preying/scavenging and the transformative powers of water. According to Reed, to notice and interpret the clues representing the novel's central themes that Dickens gives his reader, the reader must have a surplus of these clues. Echoing Reed's sentiments, in her 1979 article [...] "The Artistic Reclamation of Waste in Our Mutual Friend," [...] Nancy Aycock Metz claims, [...] "The reader is thrown back upon his own resources. He must suffer, along with the characters of the novel, from the climate of chaos and confusion, and like them, he <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> make connections and impose order on the details he observes." ...|$|E
