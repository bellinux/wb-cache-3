5|$|From a Neo-Darwinian perspective, {{evolution}} {{occurs when}} there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms. For example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common. <b>Mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> can lead to changes in allele frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, genetic hitchhiking, mutation and gene flow.|$|E
5|$|If genetic {{differentiation}} between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous {{in the local}} population and this may lead to organisms within these populations evolving <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important {{for the development of}} the biological species concept.|$|E

50|$|In {{firearms}} terminology, {{an action}} is the <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> handles the ammunition (loads, locks, fires, and extracts the cartridges) or the {{method by which}} <b>that</b> <b>mechanism</b> works. Breech-loading weapons have actions; actions are technically not present on muzzleloaders, as all loading is done by hand.

5|$|Paleoclimatology, {{although}} sometimes {{treated as}} part of paleoecology, focuses more {{on the history of}} Earth's climate and the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> have changed it – which have sometimes included evolutionary developments, for example the rapid expansion of land plants in the Devonian period removed more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing the greenhouse effect and thus helping to cause an ice age in the Carboniferous period.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is a poorly understood disorder, {{and a number}} of theories have speculated the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> cause the regurgitation, which is a unique symptom to this disorder.

25|$|Some {{potential}} specific psychological adaptations that Thornhill and Palmer suggest {{might be}} present in men to induce rape include {{the evolution of a}} <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> helps males evaluate the vulnerability of potential victims, or <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> motivates men with a lack of sexual access to females, to rape- the mate deprivation hypothesis.|$|R
5000|$|Described in patents 762,520 and 762,521, it {{introduces}} a new carry <b>mechanism</b> <b>that</b> reduces the power needed {{to operate the}} keys to one fourth of its predecessor's.

5|$|SFTPA2 genetic variants, SNPs, haplotypes, {{and other}} genetic {{variations}} {{have been associated}} with acute and chronic lung disease in several populations of neonates, children, and adults. Mutations in the SFTPA2 gene are found in patients with interstitial lung disease and lung cancer. SFTPA2 mutations also associated with pulmonary fibrosis via <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> involve protein instability and endoplasmic reticulum stress.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{things happen}} in other brain areas: an initial {{synaptic}} matrix is generated {{as a result of}} genetically determined chemical guidance, but then gradually refined by activity-dependent mechanisms, partly driven by internal dynamics, partly by external sensory inputs. In some cases, as with the retina-midbrain system, activity patterns depend on <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> operate only in the developing brain, and apparently exist solely to guide development.|$|E
5|$|The body's {{first line}} of defence against viruses is the innate immune system. This {{comprises}} cells and other <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> defend the host from infection in a non-specific manner. This means that {{the cells of the}} innate system recognise, and respond to, pathogens in a generic way, but, unlike the adaptive immune system, it does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the host.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{there were}} so many {{uncritical}} and unproven speculations about floral <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> floral ecology became discredited. In the 1920s, it was revived with further developments in detailed analyses of insects' senses, led by researchers Frederic Clements, Karl von Frisch and others. Their experiments resulted in new information, including the discovery that some insects have ultraviolet vision, and findings involving bee learning and communication. Modern floral ecology has been reinvigorated by its relevance for evolutionary studies.|$|E
5|$|Female {{birds have}} sperm storage <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from {{multiple}} males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against {{the possibility of}} infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{importance}} of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between {{the air and the}} snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute Qm, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> contribute to Qm.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.|$|E
5|$|One {{mechanism}} {{involved in}} recovery is nerve terminal sprouting, in which remaining brainstem and spinal cord motor neurons develop new branches, or axonal sprouts. These sprouts can reinnervate orphaned muscle fibers {{that have been}} denervated by acute polio infection, restoring the fibers' capacity to contract and improving strength. Terminal sprouting may generate a few significantly enlarged motor neurons doing work previously performed {{by as many as}} four or five units: a single motor neuron that once controlled 200 muscle cells might control 800 to 1000 cells. Other <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> occur during the rehabilitation phase, and contribute to muscle strength restoration, include myofiber hypertrophy—enlargement of muscle fibers through exercise and activity—and transformation of type II muscle fibers to type I muscle fibers.|$|E

Parliamentary elections in Singapore are required to be held regularly to elect the Parliament through universal suffrage. Although the right to vote in Singapore law is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution, the Government has affirmed that the right may be implied into the constitutional text.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{are one of}} the few animals {{where the}} {{molecular}} basis of the diversity of male sexual preferences has been examined. However, this research has been controversial, and much publicity has been produced by a study at the Oregon Health and Science University that investigated the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> produce homosexuality in rams. Organizations such as PETA campaigned against the study, accusing scientists of trying to cure homosexuality in the sheep. OHSU and the involved scientists vehemently denied such accusations.|$|E
5|$|The Cat's Eye Nebula is {{structurally}} a {{very complex}} nebula, and the mechanism or <b>mechanisms</b> <b>that</b> {{have given rise to}} its complicated morphology are not well understood. The central bright part of the nebular consists of the inner elongated bubble (inner ellipse) filled with hot gas.

The waist is observed as the second larger ellipse lying perpendicular to the bubble with hot gas.|$|E
