40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel decentralised control {{mechanism}} to manage <b>micro-storage</b> in the smart grid. Our approach uses an adaptive pricing scheme that energy suppliers apply to home smart agents controlling <b>micro-storage</b> devices. In particular, we {{prove that the}} interaction between a supplier using our pricing scheme and the actions of selfish <b>micro-storage</b> agents forms a globally stable feedback loop that converges to an efficient equilibrium. We further propose a market strategy that allows the supplier to reduce wholesale purchasing costs without increasing the uncertainty and variance for its aggregate consumer demand. Moreover, we empirically evaluate our mechanism (based on the UK grid data) and show that it yields savings of up to 16 % in energy cost for consumers using storage devices with average capacity 10 kWh. Furthermore, we show that it is robust against extreme system changes. Copyright © 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www. aaai. org). All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Die Tigray and Afar Wasser Initiative (TAWI) ist ein Kooperationsprojekt der Mekelle Universität (Äthiopien), der Fachhochschule Münster und der Westfälischen Wilhelms-Universität Münster. Gegenstand der Initiative ist die Wasserversorgung im ländlichen Raum der besonders wasserarmen Regionalstaaten Tigray und Afar im semi-ariden Norden Äthiopiens. Im Untergrund ist häufig noch Wasser zu finden, das gelegentlich auch von Menschen zu landwirtschaftlichen Zwecken extensiv genutzt wird. Dichtwände im Untergrund können dazu dienen, diese Nutzung zu intensivieren und zusätzlich den Landschafts-Wasserhaushalt positiv zu beeinflussen. Die so aufgestauten unterirdischen Wasserspeicher sollen als kleine bzw. kleinste Anlagen dezentral die Versorgungslage kleiner, lokaler Bevölkerungsgruppen verbessern. Gleichzeitig vermeidet die unterirdische Speicherung die Gefahr einer Erhöhung der Inzidenzrate für beispielsweise Malaria, wie sie infolge von oberirdisch angelegten Ponds nachgewiesen worden ist. The Tigray and Afar Water Initiative (TAWI) is a {{cooperation}} {{project of the}} Mekelle University (Ethiopia), the Muenster University of Applied Sciences (Germany) and the Westphalian Wilhelms-University Muenster (Germany). Subject of the initiative is the rural water supply for the specifically water-scarce regional states Tigray and Afar in the semi-arid north of Ethiopia. The here reported project deals with river reaches or creeks that carry water only for short time spans after longer rainfall periods in the longer of two rainy seasons. In the underground of these rivers often there is still water to be found, that is used casually by local people for agricultural purposes. Tight walls in the underground could serve to intensify this usage and additionally influence the landscape water balance positively. The so retained subsurface micro-reservoirs should serve to enhance the supply of small local user-groups locally. Storing water in <b>micro-storages</b> in the underground also avoids the danger of increasing the incidence of e. g. Malaria, an effect of open water ponds that has been proofed scientifically...|$|R

Second, to analyse the practical implications of <b>micro-storage</b> deployments in the grid, we present a novel algorithm that each agent can use to optimise its battery storage profile in order to minimise its owner's costs. This algorithm uses a learning strategy that allows it to adapt as the price of electricity changes in real-time, and we show that the adoption of these strategies results in the system converging to the theoretical equilibria. Finally, we empirically evaluate the adoption of our <b>micro-storage</b> management technique within a complex setting, based on the UK electricity market, where agents may have widely varying load profiles, battery types, and learning rates. In this case, our approach yields savings of up to 14 % in energy cost for an average consumer using a storage device with a capacity of less than 4. 5 kWh and up to a 7 % reduction in carbon emissions resulting from electricity generation (with only domestic consumers adopting <b>micro-storage</b> and, commercial and industrial consumers not changing their demand). Moreover, corroborating our theoretical bound, an equilibrium is shown to exist where no more than 48 % of households would wish to own storage devices and where social welfare would also be improved (yielding overall annual savings of nearly £ 1. 5 B) ...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of energy}} storage devices in homes has been {{advocated}} {{as one of}} the main ways of saving energy and reducing the reliance on fossil fuels in the future Smart Grid. However, if <b>micro-storage</b> devices are all charged at the same time using power from the electricity grid, it means a higher demand and, hence, more generation capacity, more carbon emissions, and, in the worst case, breaking down the system due to over-demand. To alleviate such issues, in this paper, we present a novel agent-based <b>micro-storage</b> management technique that allows all (individually-owned) storage devices in the system to converge to profitable, efficient behaviour. Specifically, we provide a general framework within which to analyse the Nash equilibrium of an electricity grid and devise new agent-based storage learning strategies that adapt to market conditions. Taken altogether, our solution shows that, specifically, in the UK electricity market, it is possible to achieve savings of up to 13 % on average for a consumer on his electricity bill with a storage device of 4 kWh. Moreover, we show that there exists an equilibrium where only 38 % of UK households would own storage devices and where social welfare would be also maximised (with an overall annual savings of nearly GBP 1. 5 B at that equilibrium) ...|$|E
40|$|Meeting the {{challenge}} of cutting global greenhouse gas emissions by 50 % by 2050, and ensuring energy security {{in the face of}} dwindling oil and gas reserves, requires a radical change in the way energy (and particularly electricity) is generated, distributed and consumed. Central to delivering this change, is the vision of a smart electrical distribution network (the Smart Grid) within which micro-generation and storage capabilities are ubiquitous, where intelligent sensing devices allow users to make informed choices about the control of devices in their home, and where producers and consumers are connected via a series of dynamically negotiated supply contracts. In this article, we describe why we believe intelligent agents are essential to delivering on the vision of a Smart Grid, and describe some results applying agents to the problem of coordinating <b>micro-storage</b> within a model of the smart grid...|$|E

40|$|For the {{application}} of durable <b>micro-storage</b> for autonomous systems and implants, 3 D thin-film batteries are leading candidates. Lithium ion batteries have the highest energy density of all known systems and are thus the best choice also for these rechargeable micro-batteries. Since liquid electrolyte based batteries present safety issues and limitations in size and design, pure solid state devices are considered particularly for miniaturization. Planar thinfilm lithium and lithium ion batteries are at present commercially available but have limited capacity (< 1 mAh/cm 2). The capacity can be increased by coating the thin-film stacks on micro-or nanostructured surfaces (3 D thin-film batteries). The main advantage of thin-film (TF) batteries is that its power can be increased by scaling down the film thickness.

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} control {{strategies}} for distributed <b>micro-storage</b> energy systems at the residential level {{to contribute to}} smart grid goals. A simulation model of an energy storage system (ESS) charger has been implemented to test these proposed control strategies. The smart community energy management system (SCEMS), acting as an aggregator of resources in the community according to the expected demand and production, sends to each individual home the active and reactive power set-points. Besides, in case the ESS has available capacity, once the SCEMS requirements are satisfied, {{it is used to}} absorb the harmonic current components demanded by the household circuitry. It allows a local improvement in the power quality of the demanded current, and thus contributes to the global power quality consumption of the community. Simulation results showing the operation of a local ESS at a home in a Smart Community are presented to validate the proposed control strategies...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} some of {{the challenges}} that arise when the new smart grid paradigm is applied to power systems. In particular, novel control strategies are designed to deal in a decentralized matter with the increasing complexity of the network. Two main areas are investigated: participation to frequency control of variable-speed wind turbines and management of large populations of competing agents (e. g. <b>micro-storage</b> devices and "smart appliances") that exchange energy with the system. The {{first part of this}} work presents two different techniques that allow wind turbines to provide frequency response: following the trip of a large power plant, the turbines population increases its aggregate generated power, reducing the resulting drop in frequency. A first method models the wind turbines as stochastic hybrid systems: the generators switch randomly between two operative modes characterized by different efficiency and generated power at equilibrium. Transitions are driven by frequency-dependent switching functions: single generators behave randomly while large populations perform deterministically, changing the total power in response to frequency variations. The second proposed control strategy allows a prescribed increase in generation, distributing the control effort among the individual turbines in order to maximize the duration of frequency support or minimize the resulting kinetic energy losses. The second part of the thesis deals with large populations of agents which determine their operation strategy in response to a broadcast price signal. <b>Micro-storage</b> devices performing energy arbitrage are initially considered: each agent charges/discharges during the day in order to maximize its profit. By approximating the number of devices as infinite, modelling the population as a continuum and describing the problem through a differential game with infinite players (mean field game), it is possible to avoid synchronicity phenomena and determine an equilibrium for the market. Finally, the similar case of flexible demand is analyzed, with price-responsive appliances that schedule their power consumption in order to minimize their energy cost. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a Nash equilibrium are provided, extending the results by introducing time-varying constraints on the power rate and considering partial flexibility of the devices.

40|$|International audienceSolid {{electrolytes}} {{are important}} part of all-solid state energy systems that store electrical energy on the chip. They allow a direct incorporation of <b>micro-storage</b> component with simple device architecture while operating at higher temperatures compared to liquid electrolytes. However, solid electrolytes are usually deposited at high temperatures, exceeding the thermal budget of current semiconductor technology. Herein, {{we report on the}} synthesis of high performance BaTiO 3 :H films as solid state electrolyte in which we incorporate protons during a room temperature RF sputtering process. Drastic changes occur on chemical, structural and electrical properties of the films when they accommodate highly mobile and reactive protons. BaTiO 3 :H films have well-defined crystalline phases and display an optical bandgap which decreases by increasing the HMR in the sputtering gas. In addition, these films show two relaxation processes. The first, thermally activated with an energy around 0. 5 eV, emerges at low temperature due to the proton diffusion within the oxide material. The diffusion of positively charged oxygen vacancies by overcoming an energetic barrier of about 1. 1 eV yields to a second relaxation which takes place at relatively high temperature.

40|$|Smart meters hold {{a lot of}} promise. Smart meters {{will enable}} demand side {{management}} for small electricity users through real time pricing and smart appliances. Smart meters will help with the integration into the electric power system of micro-generation and <b>micro-storage,</b> and of hybrid and all-electric vehicles. Smart meters will also yield unprecedented amounts of information about consumer behaviour. At present, the typical power company knows its clients ’ monthly electricity use. In the future, power companies could know electricity use per minute – if so desired. In other markets, similar revolutions in data availability have led to market segmentation. This can be benign, {{as in the case}} of targeted promotions (e. g., supermarkets) or pricing (e. g., airlines) but in other cases regulators had to step in to prevent exclusion (e. g., health insurance). Because the wholesale price of electricity varies sharply over the diurnal cycle, high-frequency use data may turn out to be very valuable to power companies.

40|$|By {{the year}} 2050, the UK must {{transition}} to a low carbon economy via an 80 % reduction of all carbon emissions. In {{order to ensure that}} this challenging low carbon emissions plan is met, not only will energy need to be generated and used more efficiently, but technologies that use cleaner energy, such as the electrification of home heating and vehicles, will need to be introduced. This increase in demand for electricity will need to be balanced with additional supply, however the current national grid is not capable of sustaining this increase. Therefore a more dynamic and efficient two-way national grid will be required which incorporates intermittent renewable resources, micro-generators, <b>micro-storage</b> devices and agent managed microgrids. Fred Schweppe, a recognised world leader in the field of electric power, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1960 onwards, researched ways in which a dynamic national grid could be implemented. However at the time the technologies available were limited. This paper compares {{the current state of the}} art techniques at solving some of problems Schweppe identified, describes the agent coordination algorithms that are used, and suggests some future research opportunities on applying agent coordination algorithms, that have not previously been used, to microgrids. ...|$|E
