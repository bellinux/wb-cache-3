THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS LEGISLATION IS NOTEWORTHY, CONSIDERING THAT <b>MERGERS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SCISSIONS</b> ARE IMPORTANT MEANS FOR THE CONCENTRATION OF GREEKENTERPRISES AND ALSO, BECAUSE THE PERPLEXITY OF THE PROCEDURE SET FORTH BY THE COMPANY LAW FAVOURS THE APPEARANCE OF DEFECTS. THE COUNCIL DIRECTIVES HAVE INTRODUCED TWO SYSTEMS OF HANDLING A DEFECTIVE MERGER OR SCISSION. PRINCIPAL AIM OF BOTH SYSTEMS IS LAW AND TRANSACTIONS' SECURITY. THE FIRST OF THESE SYSTEMS ALLOWS SHAREHOLDERS AND THIRD PARTIES TO HOLD DIRECTORS LIABLE FOR ANY FAULT COMMITED, BUT NOT TO FILE AN ACTION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DEFECTIVE MERGER OR SCISSION. THE SECOND SYSTEM WHICH HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY THE GREEK LEGISLATION PRESCRIBES THE POSSIBILITY OF A NULLIFYING ACTION.

Syp 1 arrives early but departs from the endocytic site before formation of deep membrane invaginations <b>and</b> <b>scission.</b> Using genetic, spatiotemporal, and ultrastructural analyses, we demonstrate that Bzz 1, the heterodimeric BAR domain protein Rvs 161 / 167, actin polymerization, and the lipid phosphatase Sjl 2 cooperate, each through a distinct mechanism, to induce membrane scission in yeast. Additionally, actin assembly and Rvs 161 / 167 cooperate to drive formation of deep invaginations. Finally, we find that Bzz 1, acting at the invagination base, stabilizes endocytic sites and functions with Rvs 161 / 167, localized along the tubule, to achieve proper endocytic membrane geometry necessary for efficient scission. Together, our results reveal that dynamic interplay between a lipid phosphatase, actin assembly, and membrane-sculpting proteins leads to proper membrane shaping, tubule stabilization, <b>and</b> <b>scission...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sorting, transport, and autophagic {{degradation}} of proteins in endosomes and lysosomes, {{as well as}} the division of these organelles, depend on scission of membrane-bound tubulo-vesicular carriers. How scission occurs is poorly understood, but family proteins bind these membranes. Here, we show that the yeast PROPPIN Atg 18 carries membrane scission activity. Purified Atg 18 drives tubulation <b>and</b> <b>scission</b> of giant unilamellar vesicles. Upon membrane contact, Atg 18 folds its unstructured CD loop into an amphipathic α-helix that inserts into the bilayer. This allows the protein to engage its two lipid binding sites for PI 3 P and PI(3, 5) P 2 PI(3, 5) P 2 induces Atg 18 oligomerization, which should concentrate lipid-inserted α-helices in the outer membrane leaflet and drive membrane tubulation <b>and</b> <b>scission.</b> The scission activity of Atg 18 is compatible with its known roles in endo-lysosomal protein trafficking, autophagosome biogenesis, and vacuole fission. Key features required for membrane tubulation <b>and</b> <b>scission</b> by Atg 18 are shared by other PROPPINs, suggesting that membrane scission may be a generic function of this protein family...|$|R
