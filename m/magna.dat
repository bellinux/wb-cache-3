5|$|In 1621, a {{bill was}} {{presented}} to Parliament to renew <b>Magna</b> Carta; although this bill failed, lawyer John Selden argued during Darnell's Case in 1627 that the right of habeas corpus was backed by <b>Magna</b> Carta. Coke supported the Petition of Right in 1628, which cited <b>Magna</b> Carta in its preamble, attempting to extend the provisions, and to make them binding on the judiciary. The monarchy responded by arguing that the historical legal situation was much less clear-cut than was being claimed, restricted the activities of antiquarians, arrested Coke for treason, and suppressed his proposed book on <b>Magna</b> Carta. Charles initially did not agree to the Petition of Right, and refused to confirm <b>Magna</b> Carta {{in any way that}} would reduce his independence as King.|$|E
5|$|In 1687, William Penn {{published}} The Excellent Privilege of Liberty and Property: {{being the}} birth-right of the Free-Born Subjects of England, which contained the first copy of <b>Magna</b> Carta printed on American soil. Penn's comments reflected Coke's, indicating {{a belief that}} <b>Magna</b> Carta was a fundamental law. The colonists drew on English law books, leading them to an anachronistic interpretation of <b>Magna</b> Carta, believing that it guaranteed trial by jury and habeas corpus.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Magnae,</b> {{sometimes}} <b>Magnae</b> Dobunnorum (Latin for [...] "The Greats of the Dobunni") {{to distinguish}} it from the <b>Magnae</b> of the Carvetii in northern Britain, was a Romano-British town and an important market centre for the British Dobunni tribe, located near modern-day Kenchester in Herefordshire, England. The town was shaped as an irregular hexagon, with a single main street {{along the line of}} the main Roman Road running east-west through the area, and an irregular pattern of side streets with tightly packed buildings leading off it.|$|R
50|$|<b>Magnae</b> was {{originally}} built {{to guard the}} junction of the Maiden Way with the Stanegate, the key supply route linking Coria (Corbridge) in the east to Luguvalium (Carlisle) in the west. As such it predates Hadrian's Wall. Its ruins are located at Carvoran in the civil parish of Greenhead in the English county of Northumberland. <b>Magnae</b> is one of 16 Roman forts along Hadrian's Wall; there are also 80 smaller milecastle forts and 158 turrets along its length. The Maiden Way ran south from <b>Magnae</b> to Bravoniacum (Kirkby Thore near Penrith).|$|R

5|$|In addition, medieval cases {{referred}} to the clauses in <b>Magna</b> Carta which dealt with specific issues such as wardship and dower, debt collection, and keeping rivers free for navigation. Even in the 13th century, some clauses of <b>Magna</b> Carta rarely appeared in legal cases, either because the issues concerned were no longer relevant, or because <b>Magna</b> Carta had been superseded by more relevant legislation. By 1350 half the clauses of <b>Magna</b> Carta were no longer actively used.|$|E
5|$|In 1534, George Ferrers {{published}} the first unabridged English-language edition of <b>Magna</b> Carta, dividing the Charter into 37 numbered clauses.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Charles Horton Peck {{described}} the variety <b>magna</b> from material collected in North Elba, New York. Peck {{explained that the}} variety differed from the typical species in several ways: var. <b>magna</b> grew among fallen leaves under balsam fir trees, or among mosses on the ground, not on buried wood; it lacked a stem, and was instead broad and rounded underneath; its hymenium was more yellow-brown then the nominate variety; and, its spore were slightly longer.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, <b>Magna</b> Carta became {{increasingly}} {{important as a}} political document in arguments over {{the authority of the}} English monarchy.

5|$|John's French defeats {{weakened}} {{his position}} in England. The rebellion of his English vassals resulted in the <b>Magna</b> Carta, which limited royal power and established common law. This would {{form the basis of}} every constitutional battle of the 13th and 14th centuries. The barons and the crown failed to abide by the <b>Magna</b> Carta, leading to the First Barons' War when rebel barons provoked an invasion by Prince Louis. Many historians use John's death and William Marshall's appointment as protector of nine-year-old Henry III to mark the end of the Angevin period {{and the beginning of the}} Plantagenet dynasty. Marshall won the war with victories at Lincoln and Dover in 1217, leading to the Treaty of Lambeth in which Louis renounced his claims. In victory, the Marshal Protectorate reissued the <b>Magna</b> Carta as the basis of future government.|$|E

5|$|Radicals such as Sir Francis Burdett {{believed}} that <b>Magna</b> Carta {{could not be}} repealed, but in the 19th century clauses which were obsolete or had been superseded began to be repealed. The repeal of clause 36 in 1829, by the Offences against the Person Act 1828 (9 Geo. 4 c. 31 s. 1), {{was the first time}} a clause of <b>Magna</b> Carta was repealed. Over the next 140 years, nearly the whole of <b>Magna</b> Carta (1297) as statute was repealed, leaving just clauses 1, 9, and 29 still in force (in England and Wales) after 1969. Most of the clauses were repealed in England and Wales by the Statute Law Revision Act 1863, and in modern Northern Ireland and also in the modern Republic of Ireland by the Statute Law (Ireland) Revision Act 1872.|$|E

5|$|The charter {{became part}} of English {{political}} life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling English Parliament passed new laws, it {{lost some of its}} practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in <b>Magna</b> Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going {{back to the days of}} the Anglo-Saxons, that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights, and that <b>Magna</b> Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as habeas corpus. Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke used <b>Magna</b> Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of <b>Magna</b> Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the English Civil War of the 1640s and the execution of Charles.|$|E
