The Progressive Conservatives polled at 29 percent compared to 52 percent for the Liberals and 19 percent for the NDP.

25|$|Early successes such {{as these}} {{paved the way for}} {{dynamical}} systems research into linguistic acquisition, answering <b>many</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> early linguistic development but leaving many others unanswered, such as how these statistically acquired lexemes are represented. Of particular importance in recent research has been the effort to understand the dynamic interaction of learning (e.g. language-based) and learner (e.g. speaker-based) variables in lexical organization and competition in bilinguals. In the ceaseless effort to move toward more psychologically realistic models, many researchers have turned to a subset of associative models, self-organizing maps (SOMs), as established, cognitively plausible models of language development.|$|E

25|$|After {{a disappointing}} {{loss to the}} Nuggets in the playoffs, the Mavericks entered the {{off-season}} with <b>many</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the future construction of the team. They began by re-signing Jason Kidd to a three-year contract extension, which took care of their pending point guard issue. The Mavericks also made a move to compound their age problem, by trading for former All-Star small forward Shawn Marion. In a three-team deal with the Grizzlies and Raptors, the Mavericks sent swing-man Antoine Wright along with defensive stalwart Devean George to Toronto, while aging guard Jerry Stackhouse landed in Memphis. Dallas also acquired burly center Nathan Jawai, and Kris Humphries. Many analysts viewed this as a beneficial trade for the Mavericks, being that it countered their age issues, while simultaneously providing them with more depth on the bench. The Mavericks also added veteran forwards Tim Thomas, Drew Gooden, and Quinton Ross.|$|E
25|$|Computers {{have been}} playing an {{increasing}} role in PA for some time (Sulsky & Keown, 1998). There are two main aspects to this. The first is {{in relation to the}} electronic monitoring of performance, which affords the ability to record a huge amount of data on multiple dimensions of work performance (Stanton, 2000). Not only does it facilitate a more continuous and detailed collection of performance data in some jobs, e.g. call centres, but it has the capacity to do so in a non-obvious, covert manner. The second aspect is in mediating the feedback process, by recording and aggregating performance ratings and written observations and making the information available on-line; many software packages are available for this. The use of IT in these ways undoubtedly helps in making the appraisal process more manageable, especially where multiple rating sources are involved, but it also raises <b>many</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> appraisees' reactions and possible effects on PA outcomes. Mostly, the evidence so far is positive.|$|E
25|$|A {{spate of}} suicide bombings {{reinforced}} the Likud position for security. Hamas {{claimed responsibility for}} most of the bombings. As Prime Minister, Netanyahu raised <b>many</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> many central premises of the Oslo Accords. One of his main points was disagreement with the Oslo premise that the negotiations should proceed in stages, meaning that concessions should be made to Palestinians before any resolution was reached on major issues, such as the status of Jerusalem, and the amending of the Palestinian National Charter. Oslo supporters had claimed that the multi-stage approach would build goodwill among Palestinians and would propel them to seek reconciliation when these major issues were raised in later stages. Netanyahu said that these concessions only gave encouragement to extremist elements, without receiving any tangible gestures in return. He called for tangible gestures of Palestinian goodwill in return for Israeli concessions. Despite his stated differences with the Oslo Accords, Prime Minister Netanyahu continued their implementation, but his Premiership saw a marked slow-down in the peace process.|$|E
