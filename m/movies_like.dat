5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 2.5 out of 4 stars, saying that [...] "A <b>movie</b> <b>like</b> {{this is fun}} for kids: bright, quick-paced, with broad, {{outrageous}} characters. But [...] "Home on the Range" [...] doesn't have the crossover quality of the great Disney films like Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.
