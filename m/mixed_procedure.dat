Using a strategy where multiple pens from each of five different NPH insulin products (Insuman Basal, sanofi-aventis, three metal bullets; Humulin N, Lilly, one glass bullet; Berlinsulin H Basal, Berlin-Chemie, one glass bullet; Insulin B. Braun Basal, two glass bullets; and Protaphane Penfill, NovoNordisk, one glass bullet) were compared at multiple sampling points and over a range of <b>mixing</b> <b>procedures</b> (3, 6, 10, and 20 times), the authors identified deviations in the delivered dose of insulin at initial use and with repeated dosing.

40|$|Reliable {{application}} of neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin requires previous resuspension of the suspension by tipping over the cartridge 20 times. This procedure is considered annoying by patients. The {{goal of this}} investigation was to assess the efficiency of the <b>mixing</b> <b>procedure</b> when performed less frequently than recommended. Neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin cartridges from five different manufacturers (sanofi-aventis, Lilly, Berlin-Chemie, B. Braun, and Novo Nordisk) were emptied with doses of 28 IU in the morning and the evening over 5 days. While the first dose was obtained after a regular resuspension procedure (20 × tipping over), the consecutive doses were obtained after 3, 6, 10, or 20 <b>mixing</b> <b>procedures</b> (12 cartridges per experimental series, two doses/day). Insulin concentrations of doses 1, 2, 6, and 10 were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Between dosing, cartridges were stored at room temperature in a horizontal position. Comparable insulin concentrations were seen in the first correctly prepared doses. Pronounced and substantial deviations from the selected dose were observed with most of the cartridges, in particular when resuspending only 3 and 6 times. Mean absolute percentage deviations when tipping 3 times and maximally observed overdoses were: Insuman basal: 1. 1 ± 1. 0 %/ 4 IU, Humulin N: 2. 6 ± 3. 4 %/ 19 IU, Berlinsulin H basal: 4. 4 ± 6. 0 %/ 26 IU, Insulin B.

40|$|Background and Aims: Risk Stratification has an {{important}} place in cardiac surgery to identify high-risk cases and optimally allocate resources. Hence various risk scoring systems have been tried to predict mortality. The aim {{of the present study}} was to validate the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II (EuroSCORE II) in Indian cardiac surgical patients. Methods: After obtaining ethics committee clearance, data on EuroSCORE II variables were collected for all patients > 18 years undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve surgery and mixed (CABG + valve) procedures between January 2011 and December 2012. Mortality prediction was done using the online calculator from the site www. euroscore. org. The calibration of the EuroSCORE II model was analysed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow test and discrimination was analysed by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and calculating area under the curve (AUC). The analysis was done in the total sample, CABG, valve surgery and in mixed procedures. Results: The overall observed mortality was 5. 7 % in the total sample, 6. 6 % in CABG, 4. 2 % in valve surgeries and 10. 2 % in mixed procedures whereas the predicted mortality was 2. 9 %, 3. 1 %, 2. 4 %, 5. 1 % in total sample, CABG, valve surgery and <b>mixed</b> <b>procedure,</b> respectively. The significance (P value) of Hosmer–Lemeshow test was 0. 292, 0. 45, 0. 56 and 1 for the total sample, CABG, valve surgery and <b>mixed</b> <b>procedure,</b> respectively, indicating good calibration. The AUC of ROC was 0. 76, 0. 70, 0. 83 and 0. 78 for total sample, CABG, valve surgery and <b>mixed</b> <b>procedure,</b> respectively. Conclusion: Mortality of the sample was under-predicted by EuroSCORE II. Calibration of the EuroSCORE II model was good for total sample as well as for all surgical subcategories.

Today, use of all-in (single-stage) mixing methods is superseding multistage methods for large-scale batter preparation to reduce costs and production time. In this study, multistage and all-in <b>mixing</b> <b>procedures</b> and three final high-speed mixing times (3, 5, and 15 min) for sponge cake production were tested to optimize a mixing method for pilot-scale research. Mixing for 3 min produced batters with higher relative density values than did longer mixing times. These batters generated well-aerated cakes with high volume and low hardness. In contrast, after 5 and 15 min of high-speed mixing, batters with lower relative density and higher viscosity values were produced. Although higher bubble incorporation and retention were observed, longer mixing times produced better developed gluten networks, which stiffened the batters and inhibited bubble expansion during mixing. As a result, these batters did not expand properly and produced cakes with low volume, dense crumb, and high hardness values. Results for all-in mixing {{were similar to those}} for the multistage <b>mixing</b> <b>procedure</b> in terms of the physical properties of batters and cakes (i. e., relative density, elastic moduli, volume, total cell area, hardness, etc.).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigation together with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) phase analysis of NSC and HSC samples was conducted. Evaluation of interfacial transition zone (ITZ) between the aggregate and cement matrix was performed. Volume share, thickness, porosity and composition of ITZ were studied. In case of HSC, samples obtained by several different <b>mixing</b> <b>procedures</b> were compared in order to find the most suitable procedure. In case of NSC, ITZ was identified around 40 - 50 % of aggregate grains and its thickness typically ranged between 10 and 40 µm. Higher porosity and lower share of clinker was observed in this area as a result of increased water-to-cement ratio (w/c) and the lack of fine particles improving the grading curve of the aggregate. Typical ITZ with lower content of Ca was observed only in one HSC sample, where it was developed around less than 15 % of aggregate grains. The typical thickness of ITZ in this sample was similar to ITZ in NSC (between 5 and 40 µm). In the remaining four HSC samples, no ITZ was observed. In general, the share of ITZ in HSC samples was found to be significantly smaller than in NSC samples. As ITZ is the weakest part of the material, this result explains to large extent the improved mechanical properties of HSC compared to NSC.
