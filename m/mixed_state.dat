25|$|A simple {{criterion}} for checking whether a density matrix is describing a pure or <b>mixed</b> <b>state</b> {{is that the}} trace of ρ2 is equal to 1 if the state is pure, and less than 1 if the state is mixed. Another, equivalent, criterion is that the von Neumann entropy is 0 for a pure state, and strictly positive for a <b>mixed</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: To explore {{diagnostic}} and treatment issues concerning bipolar <b>mixed</b> <b>states.</b> Method: Bipolar <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> are described {{and concerns about}} {{diagnostic and}} treatment difficulties are summarized and discussed. Result: <b>Mixed</b> <b>states</b> can present with equal admixtures of depressive or manic symptoms, or more commonly one component predominates. There is fair consensus, although little data, regarding the management of manic <b>mixed</b> <b>states.</b> However depressive <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> are far more complex {{both in terms of}} recognition and management. People suffering from <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> characteristically present with complaints of depression. Conclusions: The boundaries between depressive <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> and agitated depression are vague, yet carry substantial therapeutic implications. Bipolar <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> are often difficult to treat, and tend to take much longer to settle than either pure mania or depression.   Furthermore there is data that treatment with antidepressants can worsen the course of <b>mixed</b> <b>states.</b> Hence missed diagnoses can potentially have negative clinical implications.   Therefore in this paper the clinical presentation, diagnosis and therapy of <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> is reviewed with a view to improving management. <br /...|$|R
40|$|We prove a {{lower bound}} for Schmidt numbers of bipartite <b>mixed</b> <b>states.</b> This lower bound {{can be applied}} easily to low rank bipartite <b>mixed</b> <b>states.</b> From this lower bound {{it is known that}} generic low rank bipartite <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> have {{relatively}} high Schmidt numbers and thus entangled. We can compute Schmidt numbers exactly for some <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> by this lower bound as shown in Examples. This lower bound can also be used effectively to determine that some <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> cannot be convertible to other <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> by local operations and classical communication. The results in this paper are proved by ONLY using linear algebra, thus the results and proof are easy to understand. Comment: 10 pages, no figur...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first quantitative metric for aerosol population <b>mixing</b> <b>state,</b> {{defined as the}} distribution of per-particle chemical species composition. This new metric, the <b>mixing</b> <b>state</b> index χ, is an affine ratio of the average per-particle species diversity D α and the bulk population species diversity D γ, {{both of which are}} based on information-theoretic entropy measures. The <b>mixing</b> <b>state</b> index χ enables the first rigorous definition of the spectrum of <b>mixing</b> <b>states</b> from so-called external mixture to internal mixture, which is significant for aerosol climate impacts, including aerosol optical properties and cloud condensation nuclei activity. We illustrate the usefulness of this new <b>mixing</b> <b>state</b> framework with model results from the stochastic particle-resolved model PartMC-MOSAIC. These results demonstrate how the <b>mixing</b> <b>state</b> metrics evolve with time for several archetypal cases, each of which isolates a specific process such as coagulation, emission, or condensation. Further, we present an analysis of the <b>mixing</b> <b>state</b> evolution for a complex urban plume case, for which these processes occur simultaneously. We additionally derive theoretical properties of the <b>mixing</b> <b>state</b> index and present a family of generalized <b>mixing</b> <b>state</b> indexes that vary in the importance assigned to low-mass-fraction species...|$|R
25|$|In bipolar disorder, <b>mixed</b> <b>state</b> is a {{condition}} during which symptoms of both mania and depression occur simultaneously. Individuals experiencing a <b>mixed</b> <b>state</b> may have manic symptoms such as grandiose thoughts while simultaneously experiencing depressive symptoms such as excessive guilt or feeling suicidal. Mixed states {{are considered to be}} high-risk for suicidal behavior since depressive emotions such as hopelessness are often paired with mood swings or difficulties with impulse control. Anxiety disorders occur more frequently as a comorbidity in mixed bipolar episodes than in non-mixed bipolar depression or mania. Substance abuse (including alcohol) also follows this trend, thereby appearing to depict bipolar symptoms as no more than a consequence of substance abuse.|$|E
25|$|Hawking {{interpreted}} this to {{mean that}} when black holes absorb some photons in a pure state described by a wave function, they re-emit new photons in a thermal <b>mixed</b> <b>state</b> described by a density matrix. This would mean that quantum mechanics {{would have to be}} modified because, in quantum mechanics, states which are superpositions with probability amplitudes never become states which are probabilistic mixtures of different possibilities.|$|E
25|$|A {{superconductor}} {{with little}} or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too large. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. In Type I superconductors, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value Hc. Depending on the geometry of the sample, one may obtain an intermediate state consisting of a baroque pattern of regions of normal material carrying a magnetic field mixed with regions of superconducting material containing no field. In Type II superconductors, raising the applied field past a critical value H'c1 leads to a <b>mixed</b> <b>state</b> (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of magnetic flux penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the flow of electric current as long as the current is not too large. At a second critical field strength H'c2, superconductivity is destroyed. The <b>mixed</b> <b>state</b> is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called fluxons because the flux carried by these vortices is quantized. Most pure elemental superconductors, except niobium and carbon nanotubes, are TypeI, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are TypeII.|$|E
40|$|From the {{consideration}} of checking <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> by separable pure states, we introduce algebraic sets, which are determinantal varieties in complex projective spaces or products of complex projective spaces, for <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> in bipartite or multipartite quantum systems as their invariants under local unitary transformations. The algebraic sets of the <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> are independent of eigenvalues and only measure the geometric positions of eigenvectors. Thus complex differential geometry and algebraic geometry of these determinantal varieties turn to be powerful tools {{for the study of}} quantum entanglement of both bipartite and multipartite <b>mixed</b> <b>states.</b> The algebraic sets have to be the sum of linear subspaces if the <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> are separable. Examples of the entangled <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> which are invariant under partial transposition (thus bound entanglement) are constructed systematically from this new separability criterion. The relation of these invariants and Schmidt numbers of the <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> is anlysised and a lower bound for Schmidt numbers of generic low rank <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> is proved. We also proved that these algebraic sets are not empty for low rank <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> and give a stronger result which can be potentially used to treat the entanglement of high rank <b>mixed</b> <b>states.</b> Based on these algebraic sets, a necessary condition of simulating Hamiltonians using local unitary transformations is given. Many examples of entangled <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> with rich algebraic-geometric structure in their associated determinantal varieties are constructed and studied from this point of view...|$|R
25|$|A <b>mixed</b> quantum <b>state</b> {{corresponds}} to a probabilistic mixture of pure states; however, different distributions of pure states can generate equivalent (i.e., physically indistinguishable) <b>mixed</b> <b>states.</b> <b>Mixed</b> <b>states</b> are described by so-called density matrices. A pure state can also be recast as a density matrix; in this way, pure states can be represented as {{a subset of the}} more general <b>mixed</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R
40|$|When <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> are {{composed}} of s memory patterns, s types of <b>mixed</b> <b>states,</b> which can become equilibrium states of the model, can be generated. We previously reported that storage capacities for most <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> composed of uncorrelated memory patterns do not diverge at the sparse limit of the firing rate, f -> 0. On the contrary to the uncorrelated case, we show that the storage capacities for all <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> composed of correlated memory patterns diverge as 1 /|f log f| even when the correlation of memory patterns is infinitestimal small. We also show that, when the firing rate is fixed, as the correlation coefficient increases, the storage capacities of the <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> composed of all correlated memory patterns increase, while those of the <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> composed of {{only some of the}} correlated memory patterns decrease.

25|$|To {{create a}} {{population}} inversion under these conditions, {{it is necessary}} to selectively remove some atoms or molecules from the system based on differences in properties. For instance, in a hydrogen maser, the well-known 21cm wave transition in atomic hydrogen, where the lone electron flips its spin state from parallel to the nuclear spin to antiparallel, can be used to create a population inversion because the parallel state has a magnetic moment and the antiparallel state does not. A strong inhomogeneous magnetic field will separate out atoms in the higher energy state from a beam of <b>mixed</b> <b>state</b> atoms. The separated population represents a population inversion which can exhibit stimulated emissions.|$|E
25|$|The earth {{inside the}} chamber {{contained}} numerous disarticulated human bones. Although the {{minimum number of}} individuals is as low as 27, the broken and <b>mixed</b> <b>state</b> of the remains suggests severe disturbance. Thus, {{it is possible that}} the number of persons buried here was originally higher. The discovery of an Urnfield period burial above the original depositions indicates that the destruction of the grave, disturbance of its contents and removal of the roof must have taken place before the 10th/9th century BC. Charcoal and ashes were found in a number of locations, especially with human remains near the doorstone and near the southwest terminal slab. None of the human bones showed signs of burning. There was a continuous ash layer in the centre of the anteroom.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} algebraic sets, {{which are}} determinantal varieties {{in the complex}} projective spaces or the products of complex projective spaces, for the <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> in bipartite or multipartite quantum systems as their invariants under local unitary transformations. These invariants are naturally arised from the physical consideration of checking <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> by separable pure states. The algebraic sets of the <b>mixed</b> <b>states</b> are independent of the eigenvalues and only measure the geometric positions of the eigenvectors.
