5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place.

Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason <b>Martha</b> <b>and</b> Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when <b>Martha</b> <b>and</b> Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E
