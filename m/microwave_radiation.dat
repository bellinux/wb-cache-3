5|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{and printed}} circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity; heat sinks and heat exchangers use copper because of its superior heat dissipation properties. Electromagnets, vacuum tubes, cathode ray tubes, and magnetrons in microwave ovens use copper, as do waveguides for <b>microwave</b> <b>radiation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Modern {{microwave}} synthetic {{methods have}} also been reported. Rhodocenium hexafluorophosphate forms after reaction of cyclopentadiene and rhodium(III) chloride hydrate in methanol following work-up with methanolic ammonium hexafluorophosphate; the reaction yield exceeds 60% with only 30 seconds of exposure to <b>microwave</b> <b>radiation.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Hendrik van de Hulst {{predicted}} that <b>microwave</b> <b>radiation</b> with wavelength of 21 cm would be detectable from interstellar atomic hydrogen gas; and in 1951 it was observed. This radiation is {{not affected by}} dust absorption, and so its Doppler shift {{can be used to}} map the motion of the gas in our galaxy. These observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating bar structure in the center of our galaxy. With improved radio telescopes, hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies.|$|E

5|$|The {{observable}} Universe is isotropic on scales significantly {{larger than}} superclusters, {{meaning that the}} statistical properties of the Universe are the same in all directions as observed from Earth. The Universe is bathed in highly isotropic <b>microwave</b> <b>radiation</b> that corresponds to a thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly 2.72548 kelvin. The hypothesis that the large-scale Universe is homogeneous and isotropic {{is known as the}} cosmological principle. A Universe that is both homogeneous and isotropic looks the same from all vantage points and has no center.|$|E
5|$|After {{four years}} in Washington, he spent four years as Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), the number two position, at Embassy Moscow. These years {{cemented}} his reputation within the State Department as a Soviet expert. In early 1976, the State Department made public {{the fact that the}} Soviet Union had been beaming microwaves at the Moscow Embassy from a nearby building for many years. This caused concern about possible health effects of the low-level <b>microwave</b> <b>radiation.</b> Ironically, it was Soviet research that documented the psychological symptoms of sensitivity to microwave exposure. In the United States, the standards for safe exposure to microwaves were much more lenient than in the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Finder No. 3, Mark IV, for the Army, but the Army {{cancelled}} {{the order}} in August 1941 when the prototype was nearly complete. In January 1942, he was seconded to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research's Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney to develop secret valves for a Radio Direction Finder. He teamed up with Eric Burhop to build a magnetron, producing a working prototype on 23 May 1942. He {{then went on to}} build an original magnetron that generated 25centimetre <b>microwave</b> <b>radiation.</b> These magnetrons were used in radar equipment by the Army, RAAF, Royal Australian Navy (RAN), and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Wishing to return to Melbourne, he stepped down as Deputy Chief of the Division of Radiophysics in January 1944, and took charge of the Valve Laboratory at the University of Melbourne.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>microwaves</b> <b>radiation</b> and cold storage against adults of sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephlius surinamensis (L.) over various {{exposure}} times and cold storage period was evaluated. The insects {{were exposed to}} 2450 MHz at five different power levels of 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 W for five exposure times of 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 min. A complete mortality was achieved for tested insect at 400 W power level for exposure time of 12 min and 72 h cold storage period. At a given time, a direct positive relationship between mortality rates and <b>microwaves</b> <b>radiation</b> power level was obtained. For instance at 100, 200, 300 and 400 W power levels and 24 h cold storage for 3 min exposure period, the mortality rates were 40, 50, 55 and 72 %, respectively. Similar trend was obtained for LT 50 values. Considerable variation in the susceptibility of tested insect to microwaves power levels and cold storage periods was apparent in the fiducial limits of the LD 50 values. In the analysis of variance (ANOVA) the R 2 value revealed that 90. 8 % of variability in the susceptibility of O. surinamensis {{could be explained by}} the microwaves power, cold storage period and exposure duration. Combinations of <b>microwaves</b> <b>radiation</b> and cold storage were found highly compatible and synergistic. This was more significant for the insects which were exposed to the highest level of <b>microwaves</b> <b>radiation</b> and cold storage period. Synergistic interaction indicates that <b>microwaves</b> <b>radiation</b> can be used with cold storage for management of O. surinamensis. This treatment could provide an effective and friendly environmental treatment technique in IPM program...|$|R

5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{model for}} the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang theory. The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe was extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the <b>microwave</b> <b>radiation</b> background.|$|E
5|$|Diamond is hard, {{chemically}} inert, and {{has high}} thermal conductivity {{and a low}} coefficient of thermal expansion. These properties make diamond superior to any other existing window material used for transmitting infrared and <b>microwave</b> <b>radiation.</b> Therefore, synthetic diamond is starting to replace zinc selenide as the output window of high-power CO2 lasers and gyrotrons. Those synthetic polycrystalline diamond windows are shaped as disks of large diameters (about 10cm for gyrotrons) and small thicknesses (to reduce absorption) and can only be produced with the CVD technique. Single crystal slabs of dimensions of length up to approximately 10mm are becoming increasingly important in several areas of optics including heatspreaders inside laser cavities, diffractive optics and as the optical gain medium in Raman lasers. Recent advances in the HPHT and CVD synthesis techniques have improved the purity and crystallographic structure perfection of single-crystalline diamond enough to replace silicon as a diffraction grating and window material in high-power radiation sources, such as synchrotrons. Both the CVD and HPHT processes are also used to create designer optically transparent diamond anvils {{as a tool for}} measuring electric and magnetic properties of materials at ultra high pressures using a diamond anvil cell.|$|E
25|$|Most EPR {{machines}} are reflection spectrometers, {{meaning that the}} detector should only be exposed to <b>microwave</b> <b>radiation</b> {{coming back from the}} cavity. This is achieved by the use of a device known as the circulator which directs the <b>microwave</b> <b>radiation</b> (from the branch that is heading towards the cavity) into the cavity. Reflected <b>microwave</b> <b>radiation</b> (after absorption by the sample) is then passed through the circulator towards the detector, ensuring it does not go back to the microwave source. The reference signal and reflected signal are combined and passed to the detector diode which converts the microwave power into an electrical current.|$|E
