5|$|Amanita ocreata {{is highly}} toxic, {{and has been}} {{responsible}} for mushroom poisonings in western North America, particularly in the spring. It contains highly toxic amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins, a feature shared with the closely related death cap (A. phalloides), half a cap of which can be enough to kill a human, and other species known as destroying angels. There is some evidence it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> toxic of all the North American phalloideae, as a higher proportion of people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished. Dogs have also been known to consume this fungus in California with fatal results.|$|E
5|$|Overall, anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that temazepam <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> psychologically habit-forming (addictive) benzodiazepine. Temazepam abuse reached epidemic proportions {{in some parts of}} the world, in particular, in Europe and Australia, and is a major drug of abuse in many Southeast Asian countries. This led authorities of various countries to place temazepam under a more restrictive legal status. Some countries, such as Sweden, banned the drug outright. Temazepam also has certain pharmacokinetic properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance that make it more apt to abuse compared to many other benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|The genus Triakis {{contains}} two subgenera, Triakis and Cazon. The leopard shark is placed within the subgenus Triakis {{along with the}} banded houndshark (T. (Triakis) scyllium). A 2006 phylogenetic analysis by J. Andrés López and colleagues, based on protein-coding genes, revealed that Triakis and Cazon are in fact not closely related, and additionally that the leopard shark <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> basal member of its family.|$|E

5|$|The river martins are in {{some ways}} {{intermediate}} between typical swallows and other passerines: they have stout bills, large feet and relatively strong legs, which is unusual in aerial feeders. They also have a large syrinx (vocal organ) and a different bronchial structure. The extent of their differences from other swallows and the wide geographical separation of these two martins suggest that they are relict populations {{of a group of}} species that diverged from the main swallow lineage early in its evolutionary history, and they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> primitive of the swallows. Like other early hirundine lineages, they nest in burrows, rather than adopted nest holes or mud nests.|$|E
5|$|What <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{originally}} restored Spitfire in {{the world}} is maintained at Fantasy of Flight in Polk City, Florida. Over a six-year period in the 1990s, this aircraft was slowly restored by Personal Plane Services in England using almost 90% of its original aircraft skins. Owner Kermit Weeks insisted that the aircraft be restored as closely as possible to its original condition. Machine guns, cannon, gun sight and original working radios are all installed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{probable}} {{prokaryotic cell}} fossils date to almost 3.5billion years ago, most prokaryotes {{do not have}} distinctive morphologies and fossil shapes cannot {{be used to identify}} them as archaea. Instead, chemical fossils of unique lipids are more informative because such compounds do not occur in other organisms. Some publications suggest that archaeal or eukaryotic lipid remains are present in shales dating from 2.7billion years ago; such data have since been questioned. Such lipids have also been detected in even older rocks from west Greenland. The oldest such traces come from the Isua district, which include Earth's oldest known sediments, formed 3.8billion years ago. The archaeal lineage <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> ancient that exists on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{that are}} {{important}} to the marsh rice rat's diet include insects, fiddler crabs, and snails, but the species is known to eat many other animals, including fish, clams, and juvenile Graptemys and Chrysemys turtles. They scavenge on carcasses of muskrats, deermice, and sparrows, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important predator on eggs and young of the marsh wren. Rice rats also eat eggs and young of the seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus) and are aggressive towards the sparrow, apparently leading it to avoid nesting in Juncus in a seaside salt marsh in Florida. On islands in North Carolina, rice rats consume eggs of Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri). They have been observed preying on alligator eggs in Georgia.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} implies, Parasaurolophus was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} closely related to Saurolophus because of its superficially similar crest. However, it was soon reassessed {{as a member of}} the lambeosaurine subfamily of hadrosaurids—Saurolophus is an hadrosaurine. It is usually interpreted as a separate offshoot of the lambeosaurines, distinct from the helmet-crested Corythosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, and Lambeosaurus. Its closest known relative appears to be Charonosaurus, a lambeosaurine with a similar skull (but no complete crest yet) from the Amur region of northeastern China, and the two may form a clade Parasaurolophini. P. cyrtocristatus, with its short, rounder crest, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> basal of the three known Parasaurolophus species, or it may represent subadult or female specimens of P. tubicen.|$|E
5|$|The {{giant otter}} is an {{especially}} noisy animal, with a complex repertoire of vocalizations. All otters produce vocalizations, but by frequency and volume, the giant otter <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> vocal. Duplaix identified nine distinct sounds, with further subdivisions possible, depending on context. Quick hah barks or explosive snorts suggest immediate interest and possible danger. A wavering scream {{may be used in}} bluff charges against intruders, while a low growl is used for aggressive warning. Hums and coos are more reassuring within the group. Whistles may be used as advance warning of nonhostile intent between groups, although evidence is limited. Newborn pups squeak to elicit attention, while older young whine and wail when they begin to participate in group activities. An analysis published in 2014 cataloged 22 distinct types of vocalization in adults and 11 in neonates.|$|E
