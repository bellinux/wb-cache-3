500|$|Modes are {{numbered}} {{according to the}} number of half-wavelengths in the vibration. [...] Some modes exhibit vibrations in more than one direction (such as drumhead mode which has two) and consequently the <b>mode</b> <b>number</b> consists of more than one number. [...] When the vibration is in one of the higher modes, there will be multiple nodes on the resonator where there is no motion. For some types of resonator, this can provide a convenient place to make a mechanical attachment for structural support. Wires attached at nodes will have no effect on the vibration of the resonator or the overall filter response. In figure 5, some possible anchor points are shown as wires attached at the nodes. The modes shown are (5a) the second longitudinal mode fixed at one end, (5b) the first torsional mode, (5c) the second torsional mode, (5d) the second flexural mode, (5e) first radial expansion mode and (5f) first radially symmetric drumhead mode.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{performance}} issues addressed by the waffle-iron filter is that in many waveguide filters the attenuation {{is dependent on the}} transmission modes of the incident signal and some filters can be quite bad at suppressing spurious modes which may be contained in this signal. [...] For instance, with the corrugated waveguide filter, on which the waffle-iron filter is based, attenuation of TEn0 modes in the stopband is strongly dependent on the <b>mode</b> <b>number.</b> [...] This is not the case with the waffle-iron filter which attenuates all TEn0 modes nearly equally up to a certain frequency. [...] The limit is the frequency at which the distance between the metal teeth is greater than half the free-space wavelength of the signal. [...] The reason for the waffle-iron design's good performance in this respect is that the distance between the teeth is the same in both the longitudinal and transverse directions and nearly the same in all directions in between. [...] This makes the waffle-iron nearly isotropic to TEM waves in all these directions. [...] Since any TEn0 mode wave can be decomposed into two TEM mode waves travelling in different diagonal directions, all TEn0 modes are affected nearly equally.|$|E

30|$|Inclusive work on {{the dynamic}} {{stability}} of cantilever cylindrical shells considering all types of follower loads and wide ranges of length and thickness ratios {{does not meet the}} needs. In this paper, dynamic stability of clamped-free cylindrical shells was studied to bring out the geometric regions in which the structure acts as a general shell or a beam. In developing the equations of motion, FST theory was used and rotary inertias were considered. The results for the equivalent beam were in complete agreement with those in the literature. Results consisted of tables containing critical longitudinal <b>mode</b> <b>numbers</b> and critical circumferential <b>mode</b> <b>numbers,</b> and also diagrams showing flutter load parameters against vast intervals of length and thickness ratios. Raising the load function degree increased critical circumferential <b>mode</b> <b>numbers</b> and critical longitudinal <b>mode</b> <b>numbers</b> in specific ranges of thickness and length ratios. The flutter load parameter decreased by increasing the length ratio and decreasing the thickness ratio. In some ranges of small length ratios, results obtained based on FST theory should be more carefully dealt with since the critical longitudinal <b>mode</b> <b>numbers</b> are obtained to be higher than 5, in which FST seems not to be accurate enough. For long and moderately thick shells, ranges of thickness ratios exist in which the shell can be analyzed with a simple equivalent beam model, which is almost independent of the loading scheme. For very short and thin shells, and also for beam-like (long and moderately thick) shells, the ratios of Leipholz's to Beck's, and Hauger's to Beck's nondimensional critical loads are the same as their corresponding values in beams. Moreover, the nondimensional frequency parameters in beam-like shells are equal in all three problems.|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in compressible magnetohydrodynamics is presented. The three-dimensional simulations consider shear flow in a cylindrical jet configuration, embedded in a uniform magnetic field directed along the jet axis. The growth of linear perturbations at specified poloidal and axial <b>mode</b> <b>numbers</b> demonstrate intricate non-linear coupling effects. The physical mechanims leading to induced secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at higher <b>mode</b> <b>numbers</b> are identified. The initially weak magnetic field becomes locally dominant in the non-linear dynamics before and during saturation. Thereby, it controls the jet deformation and eventual breakup.

According {{to the degree of}} the decrease in the local magnetic shear by the Shafranov shift, the Mercier-unstable equilibria are categorized into toroidicity-dominant (strong reduction) and helicity-dominant (weak reduction) equilibria. In both types of eqililibria, interchange modes are destabilized for low toroidal <b>mode</b> <b>numbers</b> n < M, where M is the toroidal field period of the equilibria, and both poloidally and toroidally localized ballooning modes purely inherent to three-dimensional systems are destabilized for fairly high toroidal <b>mode</b> <b>numbers</b> n gg M, For moderate toroidal <b>mode</b> <b>numbers</b> n ~ M, tokamak-like poloidally localized ballooning modes with a weak toroidal mode coupling are destabilized in toroidicity-dominant equilibria, and in contrast, in the helicity-dominant equilibria, interchange modes are destabilized.
