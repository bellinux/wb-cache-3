40|$|Binding of {{platelet}} receptor glycoprotein Iba (GPIba) to the A 1 {{domain of}} von Willebrand factor (vWF) {{is a critical}} step in both physiologic hemostasis and pathologic thrombosis, for initiating platelet adhesion to subendothelium of blood vessels at sites of vascular injury. Gain-of-function mutations in GPIba contribute to an abnormally high-affinity binding of platelets to vWF {{and can lead to}} thrombosis, an accurate complication causing heart attack and stroke. Of various antithrombotic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting human GPIba, 6 B 4 is a potent one to inhibit the interaction between GPIba and vWF-A 1 under static and flow conditions. Mapping paratope to epitope with mutagenesis experiments, a traditional route in researches of these antithrombotic mAbs, is usually expensive and time-consuming. Here, we suggested a novel computational procedure, which combines with homology modeling, rigid body docking, free and steered molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to identify key paratope residues on 6 B 4 and their partners on GPIba, with hypothesis that the stable hydrogen bonds and salt bridges are the important linkers between paratope and epitope residues. Based on a best constructed model of 6 B 4 bound with GPIba, the survival ratios and rupture times of all detected hydrogen bonds and salt bridges in binding site were examined via free and steered MD simulations and regarded as indices of thermal and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stabilizations</b> of the bonds, respectively.

One study examined a three-dimensional conducting polymer and hydrogel network inside which silicon nanoparticles reside. The framework resulted in a marked improvement in electrode stability, with over 90% capacity retention after 5,000 cycles. However, the potential for inexpensive scale up has not been thoroughly investigated. Researchers at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland offered another potential solution, utilizing slurry coating techniques - which are currently employed at large scales for electrode production - with a conducting polymer binder. In general, the conducting polymer additive provides both <b>mechanical</b> <b>stabilization</b> and an avenue for conduction, replacing the conventional two-material system of a polymer stabilizer and carbon black particles.

50|$|Osseointegration is {{a dynamic}} process in which {{characteristics}} of the implant (i.e. macrogeometry, surface properties, etc.) {{play a role in}} modulating molecular and cellular behavior. While osseointegration has been observed using different materials, it is most often used to describe the reaction of bone tissues to titanium, or titanium coated with calcium phosphate derivatives. It was previously thought that titanium implants were retained in bone through the action of <b>mechanical</b> <b>stabilization</b> or interfacial bonding. Alternatively, calcium phosphate coated implants were thought to be stabilized via chemical bonding. It is now known that both calcium phosphate coated implants and titanium implants are stabilized chemically with bone, either through direct contact between calcium and titanium atoms, or by the bonding to a cement line-like layer at the implant/bone interface. While there are some differences (e.g. like the lack of chondrogenic progenitors), osseointegration occurs through the same mechanisms as bone fracture healing.|$|E

50|$|The sensor {{capturing}} the image {{can be moved}} {{in such a way}} as to counteract the motion of the camera, a technology often referred to as <b>mechanical</b> image <b>stabilization.</b> When the camera rotates, causing angular error, gyroscopes encode information to the actuator that moves the sensor. The sensor is moved to maintain the projection of the image onto the image plane, which is a function of the focal length of the lens being used. Modern cameras can automatically acquire focal length information from modern lenses made for that camera; in a few cases, a chip can be retrofitted to a lens allowing the focal length to be communicated. Minolta and Konica Minolta used a technique called Anti-Shake (AS) now marketed as SteadyShot (SS) in the Sony α line and Shake Reduction (SR) in the Pentax K-series and Q series cameras, which relies on a very precise angular rate sensor to detect camera motion. Olympus introduced image stabilization with their E-510 D-SLR body, employing a system built around their Supersonic Wave Drive. Other manufacturers use DSPs to analyze the image on the fly and then move the sensor appropriately.

40|$|Abstractβ-catenin is {{a central}} {{component}} of the adaptor complex that links cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton in adherens junctions and thus, {{it is a good}} candidate to sense and transmit mechanical forces to trigger specific changes inside the cell. To fully understand its molecular physiology, we must first investigate its mechanical role in mechanotransduction within the cadherin system. We have studied the mechanical response of β-catenin to stretching using single-molecule force spectroscopy and molecular dynamics. Unlike most proteins analyzed to date, which have a fixed mechanical unfolding pathway, the β-catenin armadillo repeat region (ARM) displays low mechanostability and multiple alternative unfolding pathways that seem to be modulated by its unstructured termini. These results are supported by steered molecular dynamics simulations, which also predict its <b>mechanical</b> <b>stabilization</b> and unfolding pathway restrictions when the contiguous α-helix of the C-terminal unstructured region is included. Furthermore, simulations of the ARM/E-cadherin cytosolic tail complex emulating the most probable stress geometry occurring in vivo show a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stabilization</b> of the interaction whose magnitude correlates with the length of the stretch of the cadherin cytosolic tail that is in contact with the ARM region...|$|E
