40|$|This master thesis was {{completed}} at Limes Audio in Umeå. Limes Audio are specialized in speech enhancement software which is mostly used in <b>conference</b> <b>phones.</b> Their software {{is used to}} reduce noise, echo cancellation as well as reduction of distortion. When a <b>conference</b> <b>phone</b> is malfunctioning it can be troublesome to find {{the cause of the}} problem. Common issues that lead to perceived poor audio quality are rattling plastics, loose parts and an environment with demanding acoustics. There is a need for automatic tests to run on <b>conference</b> <b>phone</b> which can diagnose audio quality and the acoustics of the environment where the <b>conference</b> <b>phone</b> is located in. A previous master thesis by Wilhelmsson called "Estimating Loudspeaker Distortion and Room Reverberation Time Using a Speakerphone" focused on evaluating several tests run in MATLAB for analyzing acoustic characteristics of a room. The goal of this thesis was to continue the work of the master thesis by Wilhelmsson. Previous tests served as a basis for this thesis. The tests where modified and rewritten in C and run on a Linux computer connected to a specific <b>conference</b> <b>phone</b> model. In the extended test made in this thesis using sine sweep signals, the reverberation time as well as the distortion for the <b>conference</b> <b>phone</b> setup was determined. The calculated reverberation time was compared to the results using Room EQ Wizard and gave almost identical results. Total harmonic distortion was not easy to relate to the perceived audio quality. There is a need to further develop methods to take into account other types of distortion than the total harmonic distortion. Rub & buzz is one kind of distortion that could be of interest. To investigate pass or fail thresholds for reverberation time as well as distortion is central for further development of this test software...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article {{proposes a}} {{framework}} to model and reason {{on what we}} call multi-calendar appointment scheduling problems. Multicalendar appointment scheduling problems such as planning a <b>phone</b> <b>conference</b> of three persons in France, Tunisia, and Japan refer to various temporal conditions, involving arbitrary calendric types such as months (Islamic months are defined differently from Gregorian months) possibly belonging to different calendars (e. g. the Gregorian calendar and the Islamic calendar). To solve such problems, we suggest {{a new class of}} Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs); we call them Multi-Calendar CSPs. In this framework, the constraint variables are identified with finite, convex intervals in some calendric type and time constraints on such variables are expressed in terms of typed finite domain constraints. To solve time constraints which are defined on variables of different calendric types, a novel constraint, called calendar conversion constraint is proposed. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This article {{provides}} {{a brief overview}} of important issues for educators regarding medical education and technology.

A work group of psychiatric educators was convened three times by <b>phone</b> <b>conference</b> to discuss the literature.

RESULTS: Knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward medical informatics are important to life-long learning and modern medical practice. A needs assessment is a starting place, since student, faculty, institution, and societal factors bear consideration. Technology needs to 2 ̆ 2 fit 2 ̆ 2 into a curriculum in order to facilitate learning and teaching.

50|$|In August 2010, the BBC {{announced}} a new six-part series Twenty Twelve, {{written and directed by}} Morton.

John Clarke and Ross Stevenson, creators of The Games claimed to have had many <b>phone</b> <b>conferences,</b> meetings and over four years of email exchanges with Morton and yet the series was made without their participation or permission. Following a 'thorough legal assessment', the BBC rejected their claims stating that; 'while the premise of the two shows was similar - focusing on the buildup to the staging of the Olympic games - the content and the style of the two shows was very different'. The series commenced on 14 March 2011 on BBC Four. A second series was broadcast on BBC2 in the run up to the 2012 London Olympic Games.|$|R
