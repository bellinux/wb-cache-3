5|$|After it {{was clear}} that Austria-Hungary had lost World War I, the Austrian {{government}} decided to give Viribus Unitis, along with much of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, to Yugoslavia, the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. This <b>move</b> <b>would</b> have avoided handing the fleet to the Allies, since the new state had declared neutrality. Following the transfer, she was renamed Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{reports that}} Jack Warner had banned {{the use of}} the German {{language}} throughout the company's studios were denied by studio representatives who indicated that this <b>move</b> <b>would</b> have prevented scores of studio employees from communicating with each other.|$|E
5|$|On November 21, the California {{lawsuit was}} dropped {{in order to}} merge with the Minnesota lawsuit. Boies hoped that the <b>move</b> <b>would</b> {{speed up the process}} since the courts will likely merge the suits as they are similar {{complaints}} seeking the same outcome.|$|E
5000|$|Object Control Skills involve {{controlling}} {{objects with}} the hands or feet. Such <b>moves</b> <b>would</b> include throwing, bouncing,dribbling, and catching.|$|R
50|$|The Bulls {{entered the}} 2002-03 NBA season with an eager sense of {{anticipation}} {{on what the}} prior year’s <b>moves</b> <b>would</b> become.|$|R
25|$|We now {{present some}} {{examples}} of plays in which self-capture occurs. These <b>moves</b> <b>would</b> be illegal under the optional rule prohibiting suicide.|$|R
5|$|Opponents of D.C. {{voting rights}} {{propose that the}} Founding Fathers never {{intended}} for District residents to have a vote in Congress since the Constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states. Those opposed to making D.C. a state claim that such a <b>move</b> <b>would</b> destroy {{the notion of a}} separate national capital and that statehood would unfairly grant Senate representation to a single city.|$|E
5|$|The western {{portion of}} SR78 in North County is {{currently}} slated for several improvements. There were plans {{to construct an}} additional interchange at Rancho Del Oro Road in Oceanside; however, the Oceanside City Council decided to cancel these plans in 2005, despite studies suggesting that this <b>move</b> <b>would</b> be detrimental to the traffic in the region. The City Council reinstated those plans in September2012.|$|E

60|$|Two <b>moves</b> <b>would</b> {{have made}} Frank the conqueror, but the {{gust of wind}} upset the board, and {{scattered}} the men upon the floor.|$|R
50|$|The sixteen {{teams were}} divided into two pools of eight. The top team from each pool then <b>moved</b> <b>would</b> advance to Group I for 1999.|$|R
5000|$|For example, if one casts two yuts and one do at his/her {{first turn}} in the game, {{possible}} <b>moves</b> <b>would</b> include (see The Stations below for the station names): ...|$|R
5|$|After {{nine days}} {{quartered}} at the capitol, {{the men of}} the 11th New York were moved to the heights near the Insane Asylum to Camp Lincoln. This <b>move</b> <b>would</b> allow for easy transport across the Potomac and into Virginia when necessary. While just five miles (8km) from the capitol, the standard of living the men were used to had changed dramatically, as their usual foodstuffs were replaced with beef steak, dry bread, and coffee. Ellsworth wrote to his fiance that they had not had butter in a week.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} World Cup, the IRB enlisted some of rugby’s biggest names {{to assist in}} the bid. In March 2009, Jonah Lomu and Lawrence Dallaglio were {{announced}} as ambassadors for the bid and in April 2009 Waisale Serevi was unveiled as an ambassador to coincide with the Oceania National Olympic Committees' general assembly. May 2009 saw the IRB announce that they would drop the Rugby World Cup Sevens in order to improve the chances of the sport being included. The benefit of this <b>move</b> <b>would</b> be to make the Olympics the premier event in international rugby sevens.|$|E
5|$|Galba {{may have}} chosen to award Halotus the lucrative procuratorship {{for any number of}} reasons; during his reign, Galba was known for making often unpopular {{political}} and economical actions, supposedly for what was, at least in Galba's mind, the financial health of the city. Halotus' great rise in status, and his subsequent prosperity, may have been in some way beneficial in Galba's eyes. Less specifically, the <b>move</b> <b>would</b> certainly have had some degree of benefit for Galba in some way, whether indirectly, or directly, economically or financially.|$|E
2500|$|This {{game between}} Bent Larsen and Walter Browne {{illustrates}} an alternate winning method with a knight pawn. A variation of <b>moves</b> <b>would</b> {{have resulted in}} the [...] "building a bridge" [...] method.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{following}} <b>moves</b> <b>would</b> be done strictly in Bal-Swing. However, these moves can be seen sometimes in Balboa if they are done very small, with feet on floor and no travelling.|$|R
5000|$|Ašner himself {{admitted}} the deportations of Serbs to Serbia, but denied {{there was any}} deportations to the camps, as he stated, [...] "such <b>moves</b> <b>would</b> be expensive, as one must feed and restrain the prisoners." ...|$|R
5|$|Hunt's skill on {{the field}} and {{positive}} influence on other team members led to his emergence, early in 2007, as a future candidate for the Broncos captaincy. Broncos chief executive Bruno Cullen stated that such a <b>move</b> <b>would</b> have his and the Broncos management's full support. Current captain Lockyer also gave his support to Hunt being the next captain, saying that he has the respect of fellow players and the necessary leadership qualities.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{producers}} were against the move, as The Simpsons {{had been in the}} top ten while airing on Sunday, and they felt the <b>move</b> <b>would</b> destroy its ratings. Ratings wise, new episodes of The Cosby Show beat The Simpsons every time during the second season and The Simpsons eventually fell out of the top ten. At {{the end of the season}} Cosby averaged as the fifth highest rated show on television, while The Simpsons was thirty eighth.|$|E
5|$|On 2 January 2015, Hibernians of the Maltese Premier League, {{through their}} English {{vice-president}} Stephen Vaughan, {{announced that they}} had offered Evans a contract {{up to the end}} of the season. The British Ministry of Justice said that such a <b>move</b> <b>would</b> not be possible as Evans was a convicted sex offender on licence and, as such, barred from working abroad. Malta's Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, warned Hibernians that hiring Evans could affect the whole country's reputation, while Justice Minister Owen Bonnici stated that Evans had a right to return to his profession after being released from prison.|$|E
25|$|A player may pass on any move. Usually, passing is {{beneficial}} {{only at the}} end of the game, when all territory has been claimed and further <b>moves</b> <b>would</b> be useless, or even harmful to a player's position.|$|R
5000|$|Unfortunately, our petrol {{stocks were}} badly depleted, {{and it was}} with some anxiety that we {{contemplated}} the coming British attack, for we knew that our <b>moves</b> <b>would</b> be decided more by the petrol gauge than by tactical requirements. Rommel ...|$|R
50|$|The {{potential}} {{implications of}} such <b>moves</b> <b>would</b> {{go far beyond}} the Indo-Pakistani rivalry on the subcontinent. Russia, the principal economic and political partner of Tajikistan, has also expressed its opposition to any military presence in Tajikistan other than its own.|$|R
5|$|On 8 January 2015, it was {{announced}} by Grimsby Town director John Fenty that a financial backer had offered the club to pay his full wages {{in order to bring}} Evans to the Conference Premier club. Having held a board meeting along with team manager Paul Hurst it was decided that the <b>move</b> <b>would</b> be of too high risk for the club. Grimsby had previously employed Clayton McDonald, the fellow footballer and friend of Evans who was acquitted in the same case, during the 2013–14 season.|$|E
5|$|On December 7, 2016, Microsoft {{announced}} that {{as part of}} a partnership with Qualcomm, it planned to introduce support for running Win32 software on ARM architecture with a 32-bit x86 processor emulator, in 2017. Terry Myerson stated that this <b>move</b> <b>would</b> enable the production of Qualcomm Snapdragon-based Windows devices with cellular connectivity and improved power efficiency over Intel-compatible devices, and still capable of running the majority of existing Windows software (unlike the previous Windows RT, which was restricted to Windows Store apps). Microsoft is initially targeting this project towards laptops.|$|E
5|$|Since the 2002 {{publication}} of The Rise of the Creative Class, Florida has enjoyed academic and commercial success {{in his study}} and promotion {{of the concept of}} a creative class, or a cohort of highly innovative, highly creative individuals who are sought after by businesses. Who's Your City?, Florida's fourth book on the subject, combines scholarly research with a lighthearted self-help tone. Some critics questioned the assumption that the target audience, those easily able to <b>move,</b> <b>would</b> consult the book for advice on moving, but also found the book provides a valuable insight into the impacts of locational choices on the urbanized world.|$|E
50|$|The Blackhawks {{faced an}} offseason of change after being crowned Stanley Cup Champions {{for a third}} time in six years. Coming into the offseason, it was well known Chicago was facing {{impending}} cap space struggles and <b>moves</b> <b>would</b> need to be made.|$|R
50|$|If a {{contestant}} was {{on level}} one, Eliminator <b>would</b> <b>move</b> one square behind them. In the same way, if the contestant was on level two, Eliminator <b>would</b> <b>move</b> two squares behind them, and <b>would</b> <b>move</b> three squares behind {{them if they}} were on level three.|$|R
50|$|In March 2010, BJ's {{announced}} they <b>would</b> <b>move</b> their corporate headquarters from Natick to Westborough, Massachusetts in 2011. On January 5, 2011, BJ's {{announced it would}} close five underperforming stores in the Southeast, eliminate approximately 100 headquarters jobs {{by the end of}} the month, and restructure its home office and some field operations. Its restructuring <b>moves</b> <b>would</b> result in savings of 78 to 82 cents per share for its fiscal fourth quarter.|$|R
5|$|The Belgian {{strategy}} for a defence against German aggression faced political {{as well as}} military problems. In terms of military strategy, the Belgians were unwilling to stake everything on a linear defence of the Belgian–German border, in an extension of the Maginot Line. Such a <b>move</b> <b>would</b> leave the Belgians vulnerable to a German assault in their rear, through an attack on the Netherlands. Such a strategy would also rely on the French to move quickly into Belgium and support the garrison there.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} had escalated when, in 40 AD, Caligula {{announced to the}} senate {{that he planned to}} leave Rome permanently and to move to Alexandria in Egypt, where he hoped to be worshipped as a living god. The prospect of Rome losing its emperor and thus its political power was the final straw for many. Such a <b>move</b> <b>would</b> have left both the senate and the Praetorian Guard powerless to stop Caligula's repression and debauchery. With this in mind Chaerea convinced his fellow conspirators to put their plot into action quickly.|$|E
5|$|All regular {{flights were}} {{converted}} to scheduled services in March 2000, with passenger service to Taipei, Bangkok and Tokyo commenced in July 2002, November 2003 and April 2004, respectively. Dragonair Cargo continued to see steady growth and the airline began a Hong Kong–Shanghai freight route on behalf of DHL in June 2003 and leased an Airbus A300 freighter to start a cargo service to Nanjing in June 2004. A second daily European loop to Frankfurt and London, in addition to Manchester and Amsterdam, followed and by mid-2004 the airline had five Boeing 747 freighters and 26 Airbus passenger aircraft. In a bitter Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) hearings in 2004, Cathay Pacific applied to fly to three mainland cities to which Dragonair filed an objection, saying the <b>move</b> <b>would</b> {{have an effect on}} its very survival.|$|E
50|$|It can {{be argued}} that an American attack would have {{probably}} resulted in the deaths of Soviet soldiers and a retaliatory strike on another American position in the world such as West Berlin. Such <b>moves</b> <b>would</b> have possibly resulted in an all-out nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Though CPI (M) {{has sought}} to build what it terms a [...] "secular and {{democratic}} alternative" [...] to the INC and BJP, general secretary Prakash Karat discarded the notion that these <b>moves</b> <b>would</b> result in a Third Front electoral alliance. He also suggested a possible Third Front would only emerge after the election.|$|R
