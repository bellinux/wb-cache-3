The predicted surface and μ-ILED temperatures agree well with experiments and finite element simulations.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{methodology}} for computer-aided <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>layouts</b> <b>of</b> buildings. The presented methodology addresses {{the very early}} phase <b>of</b> <b>designing</b> that is called Conceptual Design. In this methodology the architect does not pay attention to layout details, but operates on functional requirements, constraints, and high-level architectural concepts such as functional areas and rooms. The GraCAD system realizes this methodology by adding a high-level design tool to the wellknown commercial program ArchiCAD. This design tool has been realized using graph-based knowledge representation techniques and graph grammars as offered by the system PROGRES. Preliminary {{results show that the}} developed ArchiCAD add-on and the formalism of graph grammars seems to be useful in aiding architectural design...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} calculation model {{based on the}} ergonomic evaluation of team performance was proposed in order {{to carry out the}} ergonomic evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>layout</b> <b>design</b> schemes <b>of</b> the action station in a multitasking operational room. This model was constructed in order to calculate and compare the theoretical value of team performance in multiple layout schemes by considering such substantial influential factors as frequency of communication, distance, angle, importance, human cognitive characteristics and so on. An experiment was finally conducted to verify the proposed model under the criteria of completion time and accuracy rating. As illustrated by the experiment results,the proposed approach is conductive to the prediction and ergonomic evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>layout</b> <b>design</b> schemes <b>of</b> the action station during early design stages,and provides a new theoretical method for the ergonomic evaluation,selection and optimization <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>layout</b> <b>design</b> schemes...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{an attempt to}} increase the intelligence of a CAD system by adding capabilities (1) to systematically enumerate alternative solutions to a design problem, and (2) to take, at the same time, {{a broad spectrum of}} criteria or concerns into account. These capabilities are intended to complement the designer's abilities and performance. In connection with such attempts, fundamental problems arise when the objects to be designed have shape and are located in space. These problems are identified, and an approach to solve them is outlined. This approach is currently being tested over a range of domains all of which deal with the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>layouts</b> <b>of</b> rectangles subject to constraints and criteria. The search for alternatives takes place in a state space with properties that make it possible to systematically explore and evaluate the power of various search strategies or planning paradigms. The state space is established through a domain-independent generator, while the evaluation of points in that space is carried out by a domain-dependent tester built up through a process of knowledge acquisition familiar from work with expert system...|$|R
