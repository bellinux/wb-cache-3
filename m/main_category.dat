25|$|Predation is a {{biological}} interaction where a predator (a heterotroph that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators {{may or may}} not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation almost always results in the death of the prey. The other <b>main</b> <b>category</b> of consumption is detritivory, the consumption of dead organic matter. It can at times be difficult to separate the two feeding behaviours, for example, where parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on its decaying corpse. Selective pressures imposed on one another has led to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in various antipredator adaptations.|$|E
