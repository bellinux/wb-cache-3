This was the only <b>metalled</b> <b>road</b> the Japanese could use, and it was vital for them to break through to allow Yamamoto's tanks and heavy artillery to attack the main defences around Imphal itself. Only a few miles north of the saddle was Palel airfield, one of the only two all-weather airfields in the plain, and vital to the defenders.|$|E

25|$|As the British {{war machine}} pushed on across the Sinai Peninsula the {{infrastructure}} and supporting British garrisons strongly held all the territory they occupied. By {{the end of}} February 1917, 388miles of railway (at a rate of 1 kilometre a day), 203miles of <b>metalled</b> <b>road,</b> 86miles of wire and brushwood roads and 300miles of water pipeline had been constructed. The pipeline required three huge pumping plants working 24hours a day at Kantara, near a reservoir of 6,000,000 gallons. For local use, the pumps forced the water through 5inch pipe to Dueidar, through a 6inch pipe to Pelusium, Romani and Mahemdia and through a 12inch pipe the main supply was pushed across the desert from pumping station to pumping station. At Romani a concrete reservoir contained a further 6,000,000 gallons, at Bir el Abd 5,000,000 and at Mazar 500,000 and another of 500,000 at El Arish. And with railhead at Rafa, Gaza was by then just twenty miles away, five to six hours for infantry and mounted units at a walk and 2hours distant for horses at a trot.|$|E

500|$|Since ancient times, {{the town}} had been a trading centre, with roads {{radiating}} from it in all directions. To the north-east the only sealed, metalled motor road in the region, stretched along a spine of the Judean Hills to Jerusalem, via Edh Dhahriye, Hebron and Bethlehem, along the Wadi el Khalil (a tributary of the Wadi es Saba). To the north-west the road to Gaza [...] away crossed the open plain, to the west the track to Rafa via Tel el Fara (on the Wadi Ghazzeh), while the southern road to Asluj and Hafir el Auja continued the <b>metalled</b> <b>road</b> from Jerusalem.|$|E

500|$|Infantry {{from the}} 75th Division {{was to move}} up the main road despite several demolitions being carried out by the {{retiring}} Ottomans on this good <b>metalled</b> <b>road</b> running east to west through Amwas. On the left and {{to the north of the}} 75th Division, infantry from the 52nd (Lowland) Division was to make its way up minor roads or tracks from Ludd towards Jerusalem. And further north on the left of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, the Yeomanry Mounted Division was to move north and north east. Their aim was to cut the Ottoman Seventh Army's lines of communication at Bireh, [...] north of Jerusalem on the Jerusalem to Nablus road.|$|E
500|$|At 17:00 on 25 October the regiment, located around [...] from Beersheba, {{started to}} moved forward. Its first objective, [...] {{south-east}} at Esani, was reached at 01:00 on 26 October. Here they rested {{for two days}} before setting out again, travelling another [...] to Asluj {{to the south of}} Beersheba. Waiting until the next night at 18:00, they started north to attack Beersheba, the first [...] along a <b>metalled</b> <b>road.</b> Then they followed the Wadi Imshash for the next , stopping at 02:00 while the Canterbury Mounted Rifles reconnoitred a suspected Turkish post. The night march started again an hour later. By daylight the brigade was positioned [...] to [...] south of the Beersheba-Bir Arara Road, to the south-east of the [...] high Saba hill, with the regiment being the brigade reserve.|$|E
500|$|During the {{stalemate}} from April {{to the end}} of October, 1917 the EEF and the Ottoman Army improved their lines of communication, laid more railway and water lines and sent troops, guns and ammunition forward to defend their front lines. While the Ottoman lines of communication were shortened by the retreat across the Sinai, the EEF advance across the Sinai Peninsula into southern Palestine lengthened theirs, requiring a large investment in infrastructure. Since a brigade of light horse, mounted rifles, or mounted yeomanry (including infantry divisions) consisted of about 2,000 soldiers requiring ammunition, rations and supplies, this was a major undertaking. By March 1917, [...] of <b>metalled</b> <b>road,</b> [...] of wire-and-brushwood roads and [...] of water pipeline had been constructed, and [...] of railway lines laid at a rate of one kilometre a day. The railhead had been [...] from Gaza, but by mid-April the line had reached Deir el Belah, with a branch line to Shellal completed. Since the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps alone could not support a large offensive in advance of the railhead, horse- and mule-drawn wagon trains were established. Supply columns were designed to support military operations by infantry and mounted troops for about 24 hours beyond the railhead.|$|E

500|$|Transporting {{supplies}} {{forward from}} railhead {{was a slow}} but continuous 24-hour-a-day business, because the Ottoman Army had destroyed as much of their infrastructure as they could during their retreat. Only lorries of the British Army Service Corps (ASC) Motor Transport companies and camels of the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps could use the single, narrow, poorly <b>metalled</b> <b>road</b> from Gaza to Junction Station. Between Gaza and Beit Hanun the road was unsealed and deep in sand {{making it difficult for}} lorries to proceed, even with a light load of one ton. Supplies were also shipped by sea and landed at Wadi Sukereir, and later at Jaffa. Lack of infrastructure at Jaffa meant all supplies brought via ship had to be cross-loaded onto surf boats, which then had to be unloaded on the beaches. Such operations were heavily dependent on the weather, so the amount of supplies transported by sea was limited. But feeding an army dependent on horses was a huge task; the marching ration of a horse was [...] of grain a day. Even this small amount, which lacked any bulk food, when multiplied by the 25,000 horses in the Desert Mounted Corps, worked out at over 100 tons of grain a day. One hundred lorries would be needed for the horses as well as transportation for rations required by the troops in the front line.|$|E
2500|$|The Ottoman {{withdrawal}} {{back from}} Khan Yunis and Shellal, put enough {{distance between the}} two forces to require a pause in the advance, while the railway was laid to Rafa. By the end of February 1917, [...] of railway had been laid (at a rate of 1 kilometre a day), [...] of <b>metalled</b> <b>road,</b> [...] of wire and brushwood roads, and [...] of water pipeline had been constructed. And the Royal Navy undertook to land stores {{on the beach at}} Deir el Belah as soon as required and until the railway approached the Wadi Ghazzee.|$|E
2500|$|After 1900 {{upgrading}} {{the infrastructure of}} ports and roads was {{a high priority for}} the Dutch, with the goal of modernising the economy, facilitating commerce, and speeding up military movements. By 1950 Dutch engineers had built and upgraded a road network with 12,000km of asphalted surface, 41,000km of <b>metalled</b> <b>road</b> area and 16,000km of gravel surfaces. In addition the Dutch built, [...] of railways, bridges, irrigation systems covering 1.4 million hectares (5,400 sq mi) of rice fields, several harbours, and 140 public drinking water systems.

2500|$|Although the Ottoman {{forces had}} been driven out of Beersheba, {{they had not been}} {{dislodged}} {{from the rest of the}} Ottoman defensive line stretching westward to the Mediterranean coast, which had been destablished and [...] "thrown back on its left, but not broken". The remainder of their line continued to be strongly defended, particularly at Hareira, Sharia and Gaza, but the loss of Beersheba had placed EEF mounted units across the Beersheba to Hebron and Jerusalem road, and three Eighth Army infantry battalions were sent by the German General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein to reinforce the Ottoman troops fighting at Khuweilfe. They were to protect the only <b>metalled</b> <b>road</b> heading north in the region, which ran direct to Hebron and Jerusalem only about 50 miles (80km) to the north, from the threat of an EEF mounted advance.|$|E
60|$|In {{due time}} George and Sophie asked {{each other that}} question, and put it aside. They argued that the climate--a pearly blend, unlike the hot and cold ferocities of their native land--suited them, as the thick stillness of the nights {{certainly}} suited George. He was saved even {{the sight of a}} <b>metalled</b> <b>road,</b> which, as presumably leading to business, wakes desire in a man; and the telegraph office at the village of Friars Pardon, where they sold picture post-cards and pegtops, was two walking miles across the fields and woods.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} (March 24) {{was dark and}} threatening. At 6.30 A.M. we struck into the path, a mere bush-track, the corduroys and bridges made by the Swanzy house having {{completely}} disappeared. This want of public feeling, of 'solidarity,' amongst the several mining companies should be remedied with a strong hand. These men seem not to know that rivalry may be good in buying palm-oil, but is the wrong thing in mining. Such a jealousy assisted in making the Spanish proverb 'A silver mine brings wretchedness; a gold mine brings ruin.' Even in England I have met with unwise directors who told me, 'Oh, you must not say that, or people will prefer such and such a mine.' But, speaking generally, employers are aware that unity of interest should produce solidarity of action. The local employés like to breed divisions, {{in order to increase}} their own importance. This should be put down with a strong hand; and all should learn the lesson that what benefits one mine benefits all. Many of the little streams run between steep banks, and in the rainy season mud and water combine to make the line impracticable. Yet there is nothing to {{stand in the way of}} a cheap tram; and perhaps this would cost less and keep better than a <b>metalled</b> <b>road.</b> The twisting of the track, 'without rhyme or reason,' reminded me of the snakiest paths in Central Africa. Our course, as the map shows, was in every quadrant of the compass except the south-western.|$|E
