Minimization of the total energy of the system leads to a singular second order boundary value problem for the function ζ(r) describing the axially symmetric shape of the free surface.

5000|$|The <b>Minisci</b> {{reaction}} (...) is a named {{reaction in}} organic chemistry. It {{is a radical}} substitution to an aromatic compound, in particular to a heteroaromatic base, that introduces an alkyl group. The reaction was published about in 1971 by F. <b>Minisci.</b> The aromatic compound is generally electron-deficient and with N-aromatic compounds the nitrogen atom is protonated. A typical reaction is that between pyridine and pivalic acid to 2-tert-butylpyridine with silver nitrate, sulfuric acid and ammonium persulfate. The reaction resembles Friedel-Crafts alkylation but with opposite reactivity and selectivity.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Minisci</b> {{reaction}} proceeds regioselectively and {{enables the}} introduction {{of a wide range of}} alkyl groups. A side-reaction is acylation. The ratio between alkylation and acylation depends on the substrate and the reaction conditions. Due to the simple raw materials and the simple reaction conditions the reaction has many applications in heterocyclic chemistry.|$|R

40|$|Carbon-centered {{radicals}} represent highly useful reactive intermediates {{in organic}} synthesis. Their nucleophilic character is reflected by fast additions to electron deficient C=X double bonds as present in iminium ions or cationic heterocycles. This review covers diverse reactions of preformed or in situ-generated cationic substrates with {{various types of}} C-radicals, including alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, trifluoromethyl, aryl, acyl, carbamoyl, and alkoxycarbonyl species. Despite its high reactivity, the strong interaction of the radical’s SOMO with the LUMO of the cation frequently results in a high regioselectivity. Intra- and intermolecular processes such as the <b>Minisci</b> reaction, the Porta reaction, and the Knabe rearrangement will be discussed along with transition metal and photoredox catalysis or electrochemical methods to generate the odd-electron species...|$|R

Lithi-ation of 5 -benzoylpicolinamide with BuLi at – 78 ◦C {{followed by}} treatment with methyl bromoac-etate gave vertilecanin C [methyl 2 -(3 -benzoylpicolinamido) acetate], a natural product. Vertilecanin A type phenopicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized starting from nicotinic acid in 4 steps. Chlo-rination of nicotinic acid with SOCl 2 followed by treatment with anisole {{in the presence}} of AlCl 3 gave (4 -methoxyphenyl) (pyridin- 3 -yl) methanone. The <b>Minisci</b> reaction of the ketone afforded 5 -(4 -methoxybenzoyl) picolinamide. TiCl 4 -catalyzed acidic hydrolysis of the picolinamide gave 5 -(4 -methoxy-benzoyl) picolinic acid, from which 5 -(hydroxy(4 -methoxyphenyl) methyl) picolinic acid was obtained by selective reduction with NaBH 4.

30|$|Bipyridine {{displays}} excellent {{catalytic activity}} in autoxidation if added to manganese 2 -ethylhexanoate, {{but it has}} a retarding effect on the catalytic activity of cobalt dryers (Warzeska et al. 2002). Polyamines, such as 1, 1, 4, 7, 10, 10 -hexamethyl triethylenetetramine (HMTETA) in a complex with manganese, accelerate the oxidation of ethyl linoleate (Oyman et al. 2004). Likewise, another polyamine 1, 4, 7 -trimethyl- 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane (MeTACN) forms a complex with manganese(IV) (MnMeTACN) that catalyses the oxidation of ethyl linoleate (Oyman et al. 2004). Working with ethyl linoleate as a surrogate for linseed oil, van Gorkum has reported [Mn(III)(tbpppy)(dpm)] (where H 2 tbpppy is 2 -[bis(2 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -di-tert-butylbenzyl)aminomethyl]pyridine and Hdpm is dipivaloylmethane) to be the best potential alkyd paint dryer, acting through a reduction of Mn(III) to Mn(II) (van Gorkum et al. 2007). Cobalt and copper salts have been reported to enhance the catalytic activity of the manganese salt in the decomposition of hydroperoxides (<b>Minisci</b> et al. 2003).|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen-rich heterocyclic {{compounds}} {{have had}} a profound impact on human health, as these chemical motifs are found in a large number of drugs used to combat a broad range of diseases and pathophysiological conditions. Advances in transition metal-mediated cross-coupling have simplified the synthesis of such molecules; however, the development of practical and selective C–H functionalization methods that do not rely upon prefunctionalized starting materials is an underdeveloped area. 1 – 9 Paradoxically, the innate properties of heterocycles that make them so desirable for biological applications render them challenging substrates for direct chemical functionalization, such as limited solubility, functional group incompatibilities, and reagent/ catalyst deactivation. Herein we report that zinc sulfinate salts 9 can be used to transfer alkyl radicals to heterocycles, allowing for a mild, direct and operationally simple formation of medicinally relevant C–C bonds while reacting in an orthogonal fashion to other innate C–H functionalization methods (<b>Minisci,</b> borono-Minisci, electrophilic aromatic substitution, transition metal-mediated C–H insertion, C–H deprotonation). 2 – 7, 9 A toolkit of these reagents was prepared and reacted across a wide range of heterocycles (natural products, drugs, building blocks) withou...|$|R
40|$|Synthesis and {{applications}} of alkyl- and aryl-substituted NHC-boranes has been demonstrated. Chapter 1 shows {{the synthesis of}} methyl- and phenyl-substituted NHC-boranes by using organolithium reagents. Other alkyl- and aryl-substituted NHC-boranes have been prepared by hydroboration of alkenes and arynes respectively. The prepared substituted NHC-boranes were converted to Suzuki coupling precursors such as boronic acids, trifluoroborate salts, pinacol boronate esters and MIDA boronates. Fluorinated NHC-boranes were made by electrophilic fluorination of NHC-boranes with Selectfluor. The diMe-Imd-BF 2 H has been synthesized via {{the use of a}} nucleophilic fluorination source (TBAF). The corresponding boryl radical has been generated and its properties have been compared to the boryl radical of the parent diMe-Imd-BH 3. Chapter 2 describes the use of B-halo substituted NHC-boranes in the Suzuki coupling reactions. The NHC-(dibromo) arylboranes are converted to the boronic acids in-situ while the NHC-(difluoro) arylboranes are analogous to potassium trifluoroborate salts and used directly in the Suzuki coupling reaction. The potential for the use of NHC-(difluoro) arylboranes as a boron masking partner has been demonstrated. NHC-(difluoro) pinylborane has been used in the <b>Minisci</b> reaction showcasing the utility of NHC-boranes as a new boron partner in the C-C bond formation reactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{intramolecular}} radical {{addition to}} aniline derivatives was investigated by DFT calculations. The computational methods were benchmarked {{by comparing the}} calculated values of the rate constant for the 5 - exo cyclization of the hexenyl radical with the experimental values. The dispersion-corrected PW 6 B 95 -D 3 functional provided very good results with deviations for the free activation barrier compared to the experimental values of only about 0. 5 kcal mol − 1 and was therefore employed in further calculations. Corrections for intramolecular London dispersion and solvation effects in the quantum chemical treatment are essential to obtain consistent and accurate theoretical data. For the investigated radical addition reaction {{it turned out that}} the polarity of the molecules is important and that a combination of electrophilic radicals with preferably nucleophilic arenes results in the highest rate constants. This is opposite to the <b>Minisci</b> reaction where the radical acts as nucleophile and the arene as electrophile. The substitution at the N-atom of the aniline is crucial. Methyl substitution leads to slower addition than phenyl substitution. Carbamates as substituents are suitable only when the radical center is not too electrophilic. No correlations between free reaction barriers and energies (Δ G ‡ and Δ G R) are found. Addition reactions leading to indanes or dihydrobenzofurans are too slow to be useful synthetically...|$|R
40|$|Three {{types of}} ergolines, having a {{substituent}} in ring A were designed and their total syntheses were attempted. N-substituted 12 -methoxyergolines were synthesized as potential serotonergic agents {{to test the}} hypothesis of bioisosterism between the C 8 carbonyl oxygen of LSD and an ortho oxygen or a 5 -oxygen atom in hallucinogenic phenethylamines and tryptamines, respectively. ^ To investigate the enhanced dopaminergic effect of 13 -hydroxylation of ergolines, 2 -hydroxybenzergolines and 13 -hydroxyergoline were designed. A variety of approaches were examined to effect the construction of these targets. A classical approach involving the construction of 4 -keto- 7 -methoxybenz[cd[*]]indole as a synthon was unsuccessful. Several different attempts to prepare this tricyclic ketone all failed, apparently due to the decreased reactivity of the indole- 4 -position that results from the presence of the methoxy group at the 6 -position of indole in the necessary precursors to the tricyclic ketone. ^ Alternative synthetic approaches involved Suzuki cross-coupling of 6 -methoxyindole- 4 -boronic acid with either a 4 -substituted isoquinoline or 3 -substituted pyridine precursor. Although the coupling reactions proceeded well, intramolecular ring closure reactions to construct ring C generally failed. Of particular note, however, is potential for a Hammick reaction to effect this transformation, and promising preliminary results in this thesis work suggesting that future efforts employing this approach may be fruitful. An additional promising route involved the <b>Minisci</b> reaction, which in this work was successfully employed to produce a 13 -methoxy- 4 -oxoergoline. ...|$|R
