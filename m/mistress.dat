40|$|This project {{compares the}} {{depiction}} of two black maids and their <b>mistresses</b> from Gone with the Wind and The Help by analyzing the transcribed scenes, one from each movie.

It is found that grammar differences are more substantial than the phonetic ones and that the maids and <b>mistresses</b> adhere {{to the rules of}} AAVE and SAVE in various degrees. The <b>mistresses</b> virtually fit into a Southern Belle stereotype that is superior to the maids, and the maids follow the oppressed black stereotype; both prevailing in the depicted era. Both maids and <b>mistresses</b> have to match their stereotypes to fit into society...|$|R
