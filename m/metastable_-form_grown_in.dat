40|$|Microporous, {{non-woven}} nylon 6 (N 6) scaffolds {{were prepared}} {{with an air}} jet spinning (AJS) approach. In this process, polymer fibers with diameters down to the nanometer range (nanofibers) were formed by subjecting a fluid jet to high pressure air. The effects of the solution conditions on the morphological appearance and average diameter of the as-spun N 6 fibers and crystal structure were investigated. The morphological properties of the AJS membrane mats could easily be tailored by adjusting the concentration of the polymer solution. Solutions at high concentrations were necessary to form well-defined fibers without beads. The production rate (viz. solvent evaporation rate) had the greatest effect on the chain structure conformation of N 6. The predominant structure phase of the N 6 fibers fabricated by AJS was a thermodynamically stable ?-form while the electrospinning fibers induced the <b>metastable</b> ?<b>-form.</b> AJS significantly enhanced the mechanical properties of the N 6 mat. The bone formation ability of AJS fibers was evaluated by incubating the fibers in biomimetic simulated body fluid for 5 and 10 days at 37 °C. Overall, the new AJS approach developed for membrane structures has great potential for the fabrication of hard and soft tissue engineering scaffolds. Cuencavol. 30...|$|R

'Norland', {{vegetative}} {{growth and}} tuber productivity <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> the porous water and nutrient delivery system (PTNDS) {{developed by the}} Wisconsin Center for Space Automation and Robotics were compared with the vegetative growth and tuber productivity of plants <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> a peat:vermiculite potting mixture (PT/VR). The plants were grown at 12, 16, and 24 -h light periods, 18 degrees C constant temperature, 70 % relative humidity, and 300 micromol m- 2 s- 1 photosynthetic photon flux. Canopy height of plants <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> the PT/VR system was taller than that of plants <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> the PTNDS system. Canopy height differences were greatest when the plants were grown under a 24 -h photoperiod. Leaf and stem dry masses were similar for plants <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> the two systems under the 12 -h photoperiod. Under the 24 -h photoperiod, leaf and stem dry masses of plants <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> the PT/VR system were more than 3 times those of plants <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> the PTNDS system. Tuber dry masses were similar for plants <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> the two systems under the 12 -h photoperiod. Under the 24 h-photoperiod, tuber dry weights of plants <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> the PT/VR system were more than twice those of plants <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> the PTNDS system. A slightly higher harvest index (ratio of tuber weight to leaf plus stem weight) was noted for the plants <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> the PTNDS than for the plants <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> the PT/VR system. Plants <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> the PTNDS system at the 24 -h photoperiod matured earlier than plants grown at this photoperiod in the PT/VR system. Vegetative growth and tuber productivity of plants grown under the 16 -h photoperiod generally were intermediate to those noted for plants grown under the 12 and 24 -h photoperiods. These results indicate that potato plants <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> a PTNDS system may require less plant growing volume, mature in a shorter time, and likely produce more tubers per unit area compared with plants <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> the PT/VR system. These plant characteristics are a distinct advantage for a plant growing unit of a CELSS...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To compare cryopreserved human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs) <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> human serum-supplemented media (HS-SM) with cryopreserved HCECs <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> fetal bovine serum-supplemented media (FBS-SM). Methods: Three {{pairs of}} human corneas from donors aged 8, 28, and 31 years were {{obtained}} from the eye bank. From each pair, one cornea was used to start a HCEC culture using HS-SM; the other cornea was <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> FBS-SM. On reaching confluence, the six cell populations were frozen using 10 % dimethyl sulfoxidecontaining medium. Thawed cells <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> HS-SM were compared with those <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> FBS-SM with respect to morphology, growth curves, immunohistochemistry, real time-reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for endothelial cell markers, and detachment time. Results: No difference in morphology was observed for cells <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> the two media before or after cryopreservation. By growth curves, cell counts after thawing were similar in both media, with a slight trend toward higher cell counts <b>in</b> FBS-SM. Cells <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> both the media demonstrated a similar expression of endothelial cell markers when assessed by immunohistochemistry, although HCEC marker gene expression was higher <b>in</b> cells <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> HS-SM than <b>in</b> those <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> FBS-SM as assessed by RT-PCR. With FBS-SM, there was a tendency of longer detachment time and lower cell passages. Conclusions: HS-SM was similar to FBS-SM for cryopreservation of cultured HCECs as assessed by analysis of cell morphology, proliferation, and protein expression, although marker gene expression was higher <b>in</b> cells <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> HS-SM than <b>in</b> those <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> FBS-SM.

40|$|Glomerular cells <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> {{fibroblast}} {{growth factor}} (FGF) plus calf serum showed morphologic properties {{different from those}} of cells <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> calf serum (CS) alone. Cells <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> low concentrations of CS plus FGF grew as a monolayer in which the cells were closely apposed and nondividing, since they did not form the multiple layers seen <b>in</b> cells <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> high concentrations of CS alone. Cells shifted from growth in FGF plus CS to growth in CS alone showed morphologic features similar to those of differentiated glomerular epithelial cells, except that the cells were larger and more flattened. Indirect immunofluorescence studied using antibodies prepared against purified fibronectin or laminin demonstrated that subcultured secondary glomerular cells <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> CS alone had no detectable fibronectin or laminin on their cell surface, while cells <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> CS plus FGF showed these proteins at regions of cell-substrate contact. The differences between cells <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> CS alone and those <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> CS plus FGF were also demonstrated by the growth of subcultured glomerular cells on purified extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin, laminin, or Type IV collagen) or purified heparan sulfate. Low-density subcultured glomerular cells did not grow well on plastic alone, even in the presence of fibroblast growth factor, but grew well on plastic coated with extracellular matrix molecules. Secondary cells <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> CS alone required laminin or Type IV collagen, whereas cells <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> CS plus FGF required fibronectin or heparan sulfate...|$|R

40|$|Light, {{one of the}} {{environmental}} stimuli, is fundamental to the growth and development of plants. Red and far-red light are sensed using the phytochrome family of plant photoreceptors. To investigate the effect of light on root growth and gravitropism, we used the Arabidopsis phytochrome mutants <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> several light conditions. The root growth of phyA reared in all light conditions except white light and was stimulated compared to the WT. The stimulation of root growth was obvious <b>in</b> phyA <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> red light. On the other hand, the root growth of phyB <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> all light conditions de-creased, and the lowest rate of decrease was observed <b>in</b> phyAB <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> white and red light. The gravitropic response of phyA was stimulated compared to the WT when it was <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> all light con-ditions except far-red light. PhyAB <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> all light conditions showed the inhibition of gravitropic response. The transcript level of ACS, one of the enzymes regulating ethylene biosynthesis, increased <b>in</b> phyA <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> white and red light, but not <b>in</b> phyA <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> far-red light.
