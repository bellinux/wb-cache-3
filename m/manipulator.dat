5|$|Captain John Hart appears {{through the}} Cardiff space-time Rift using a vortex <b>manipulator</b> and asks Jack Harkness {{for help in}} {{locating}} three radioactive cluster bombs, apparently scattered across Cardiff. Jack Harkness tells his team that John cannot be trusted but agrees to help him. True to Jack's word, Captain John is lying and seizes the containers, trying to kill Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) using a paralyzing lip gloss, shooting Owen Harper (Burn Gorman), punching Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) and pushing Jack {{off the top of}} a building, thinking he's dead. However the containers, which are supposed to contain the location of a valuable diamond hidden by the lover he murdered, instead contain an explosive which latches on the DNA signature of her killer. As insurance against Torchwood leaving him to die, John handcuffs himself to Gwen and swallows the key. After superficially altering his DNA using that of the Torchwood staff, Jack and Owen are able to save John's life before banishing him. Spurned by his former lover, John leaves by means of his Vortex <b>Manipulator.</b>|$|E

The results show that actuation redundancy makes it possible to homogenize dynamic capabilities throughout the workspace and to increase the moving platform's accelerations.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the problem of}} performance evaluation of parallel <b>manipulators.</b> Although parallel <b>manipulators</b> have been extensively studied {{for more than twenty}} years, unfortunately, the concepts of manipulability and condition number were, in general, directly transposed from serial robots from the very beginning. Recently, both theoretical analysis and experiences indicate that these concepts, especially the local conditioning index (LCI), seem defective when they are applied in parallel <b>manipulators.</b> Compared with serial robots, parallel <b>manipulators</b> are better in force transmission. This paper tries to evaluate the performance of parallel <b>manipulators</b> from the view of force transmissibility. This concept is proposed, in this paper, from the investigation of planar parallel <b>manipulators.</b> It shall be said to be extended to other parallel <b>manipulators...</b>|$|R

5|$|The overall story arc {{focuses on}} the series' only playable single-player {{character}}, the protagonist Kratos, a Spartan warrior haunted by visions of himself accidentally killing his wife and child. The character finally avenges his family by killing his former master and <b>manipulator,</b> Ares, the God of War. Although Kratos becomes the new God of War, he is still plagued by nightmares and is eventually betrayed by Zeus, the King of the Olympian Gods—revealed by the goddess Athena to be Kratos' father. The constant machinations of the gods and Titans and their misuse of Kratos eventually drive him to destroy Mount Olympus.|$|E
5|$|Another bombshell is {{dropped in}} Dimitri's {{life when he}} finds out that Anton Lang, who he {{believed}} to be the son of two Marick family employees, is really his son with his maid, Corvina Lang (Margaret Sophie Stein). Dimitri had had a drunken one-night stand with Corvina which he had no memory of. Dimitri is happy to finally be a father, but Corvina convinces him not to tell Anton the truth right away. Dimitri attempts to forge relationship with Anton so it will ease the shock of the news. Nevertheless, Anton, who had believed Corvina was his sister, doesn't take the news of his parentage well and marries Kendall to throw it in Dimitri's face. Eventually, Anton sees Kendall for the <b>manipulator</b> that she is and divorces her. Anton and Dimitri manage to work things out before Anton leaves town.|$|E

5|$|On {{the third}} and fourth days (September 1 and 2, 1983), work began with the Canadarm Remote <b>Manipulator</b> System and the payload test article, and {{communications}} testing through TDRS continued. The former was successful, but the latter lost contact on a number of occasions, due to problems at the White Sands ground station. As a result, the crew had to be awakened early on September 1 {{in order to deal with}} the problem. A minor cabin pressure leak on September 2 was traced to the waste management system, and quickly controlled. The orbiter performed an Orbital Maneuvering System firing on September 2 to place itself in a lower orbit, where the air density was higher and the oxygen interaction experiments would work more effectively.|$|E
5|$|The group {{received}} {{an influx of}} funds in the late 1970s, which it used to pay housing and other expenses. In 1985, Nettles died, leaving Applewhite distraught and challenging his views on physical ascension. In the early 1990s the group took more steps to publicize their theology. In 1996, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale–Bopp and rumors of an accompanying spaceship. They concluded that this spaceship was the vessel that would take their spirits on board for a journey to another planet. Believing that their souls would ascend to the spaceship and be given new bodies, the group members committed mass suicide in their mansion. A media circus followed the discovery of their bodies. In the aftermath, commentators and academics discussed how Applewhite persuaded people to follow his commands, including suicide. Some commentators attributed his followers' willingness to commit suicide to his skill as a <b>manipulator,</b> while others argued that their willingness was due to {{their faith in the}} narrative that he constructed.|$|E
