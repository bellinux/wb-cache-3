5|$|Contrary to Feuilley's claims, Dubois {{mentioned}} that the Mascarene parrot was not edible which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> Réunion visitors mostly ignoring it. It {{was the last of}} the indigenous parrots of Réunion to become extinct. The only endemic bird species on Réunion that disappeared after the Mascarene parrot was the hoopoe starling in the mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|Little Thetford {{resisted}} the Parliamentary Inclosure Acts of William IV for sevenyears, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the strong Baptist following amongst the poor of the village. About half of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed under the Parliamentary Inclosure Thetford Act of Victoria.|$|E

5|$|Pope John Paul II {{provided}} a moral focus for anti-communism; {{a visit to}} his native Poland in 1979 stimulated a religious and nationalist resurgence centered on the Solidarity movement that galvanized opposition and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> his attempted assassination two years later.|$|E
5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements and likely tidal heating <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> melting {{of the ice}} if an antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia hydrate) or some salt was present. The melting <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176K. The ocean, however, {{is likely to have}} frozen long ago. The freezing of the water likely led to the expansion of the interior, which may have been responsible for the formation of the canyons and obliteration of the ancient surface. The liquids from the ocean may have been able to erupt to the surface, flooding floors of canyons in the process known as cryovolcanism.|$|E

5000|$|... 1964: On {{his return}} to Mount Athos, Father Paisios took up {{residence}} at the Iviron monastery, then at Katounakia. His failing health <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> him <b>to</b> leave Katounakia.|$|R
5|$|It {{is likely}} that Bede's work, {{because it was so}} widely copied, {{discouraged}} others from writing histories and <b>may</b> even <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the 13th century, {{women of}} the court were {{expected}} to be able to sing, play instruments, and write jocs partis, or partimen (a debate or dialogue {{in the form of a}} poem). The cultivation of these womanly skills <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the writings of the trobairitz.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Forbes {{stated the}} cere {{was covered by}} {{feathers}} which concealed the nostrils. This contradicts other accounts that mention that the nostrils were surrounded by red skin. Forbes based his description on the Paris specimen which had previously had its skull and mandible removed for study by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the distortion of {{the shape of the}} head and nostrils as indicated by the illustration in Forbes' article.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{and some}} of his {{siblings}} said they had been physically and psychologically abused by their father, Joseph Jackson. In 2003, Joseph admitted to whipping them as children, but has emphatically rejected the longstanding abuse allegations. The whippings deeply traumatized Jackson and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the onset of further health issues later in his life. Physicians speculated that he had body dysmorphic disorder.|$|E
50|$|A lack of metalinguistic {{awareness}} amongst Russenorsk speakers <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> them <b>to</b> {{believe they}} were speaking the language of their interlocutor; that is, that Russians believed they were speaking Norwegian and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|The latest {{redesign}} which commenced in <b>May</b> 2017 <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a {{large number}} of complaints from subscribers, chiefly that the chat room facility (which was unavaialble for three weeks) has not since worked correctly.|$|R
50|$|Heterospory {{developed}} due {{to natural}} selection pressures that encouraged {{an increase in}} propagule size. This <b>may</b> first <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> an increase in spore size and ultimately resulted in the species producing larger megaspores as well as smaller microspores.|$|R
5|$|Large scale {{changes in}} weather {{patterns}} {{may also have}} been caused by global dimming. Climate modelers speculatively suggest that this reduction in solar radiation at the surface <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the failure of the monsoon in sub-Saharan Africa during the 1970s and 1980s, together with the associated famines such as the Sahel drought, caused by Northern hemisphere pollution cooling the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Note: For {{the years}} after 2003, the Hockey Hall of Fame web site is accurate. The web site is {{inaccurate}} for the years before, for the players inducted prior {{to the establishment of}} the Toronto Hall, for example Nels Stewart, who was inducted in 1952, not 1962 as is listed on the HHOF web site. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> other publications stating the wrong years of induction. The book Honoured Members: Hockey Hall of Fame, published by the Hockey Hall of Fame itself, lists the players accurately.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is {{now found}} only in the Mikea Forest of southwestern Madagascar, but subfossil records {{indicate}} that {{it used to be}} more widely distributed in southern Madagascar. Climatic changes and competition with introduced species <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the shift in its distribution. The Mikea Forest, the only place where it is still known to occur, is threatened by human development.|$|E
50|$|Norris {{was known}} to spar 12 rounds every other day in {{preparation}} for fights. Some speculate that this intense training routine is a factor which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> ultimately <b>led</b> <b>to</b> his early expiration as a fighter.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that the museum's relationship with Redmond city planners was always contentious. [...] Schmit's putting up a Ferris wheel on the property <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> directly <b>to</b> the closing of the popular and successful museum in 1996.|$|R
25|$|By 1900 the Girls' Classical School {{was having}} {{financial}} problems as rival private schools {{were established in}} the city and public high schools became more common in Indiana. Sewall's more progressive ideas <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the drop in enrollment.|$|R
5|$|Spalding's {{memorial}} became relatively obscure, and was {{not covered}} extensively in any publication about Lutyens' works until the publication of Tim Skelton's Lutyens and the Great War in 2008. Barbara McLaren later married Bernard Freyberg, {{an officer in the}} Royal Naval Division, which Skelton speculates <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> Lutyens' commission for the Royal Naval Division Memorial on Horse Guards Parade in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{debut of}} deep-fried butter in 2010 at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Canada <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> {{a rise in}} {{attendance}} at the event. During the 18-day event in 2010, the concession stand purveying the dish sold 9,000 orders, which equated to 36,000 individual deep-fried butter balls using 800 pounds of butter. The dish was served in portions of four balls at the event, which totaled 315 calories.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} use of the stirrup from the 8th century on aided the warrior's stability and security in the saddle when fighting. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> greater use of shock tactics, although a couched lance could be used effectively without stirrups. In particular, Charles Martel recognized the military potential of the stirrup, and distributed seized lands to his retainers on condition that they serve him by fighting in the new manner.|$|E
50|$|Before the Neosho mucket was {{identified}} as a separate species, it was probably commercially popular especially as a source species for pearl button manufacture, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> partly <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the population and range decline presently observed.|$|R
5000|$|Journalist Lou Cannon {{writes that}} Jack Reagan was an {{alcoholic}} in his book Reagan. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> [...] <b>led</b> <b>to</b> his death on May 19, 1941, {{at the age of}} 57 after a series of heart attacks.|$|R
5000|$|According to BusinessWeek, {{critics of}} Welch have {{questioned}} whether the pressure he placed on employees <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> them <b>to</b> [...] "cut corners", which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> contributed to controversies over defense-contracting, or the Kidder, Peabody & Co. bond-trading scheme in the early 1990s.|$|R
5|$|The {{most likely}} cause of {{collapse}} at Tikal is overpopulation and agrarian failure. The fall of Tikal was {{a blow to}} the heart of Classic Maya civilization, the city having {{been at the forefront of}} courtly life, art and architecture for over a thousand years, with an ancient ruling dynasty. However, new research regarding paleoenvironmental proxies from the Tikal reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the abandonment of Tikal.|$|E
5|$|The {{observations}} {{made with}} the sundial provided essential confirmation {{of the need to}} reform the Julian calendar. The anemoscope, in contrast, was a complex mechanism attached to the ceiling which was used to measure the strength and direction of the wind but soon stopped functioning. The instrument <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the other name of the tower, Tower of the Winds; however, an ancient observatory at Athens was also called the Tower of the Winds and might have been the source for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} place names in Chadderton {{suggests}} that the ancient Britons once inhabited the area. Remains of Roman roads have been discovered running through the town, and the local road name Streetbridge {{suggests that the}} Romans once marched along it on a path which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> Blackstone Edge. Relics found at a tumulus in Chadderton Fold date from the Early Middle Ages, probably from the early period of Anglo-Saxon England, when Angles settled {{in the area and}} Chadderton emerged as a manor of the hundred of Salford.|$|E
50|$|In 1911 Mackrell again {{played for}} New Zealand in an {{exhibition}} match against Auckland. Mackrell received a kick to the head in a 1912 match which forced his retirement and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also <b>led</b> <b>to</b> his early death.|$|R
