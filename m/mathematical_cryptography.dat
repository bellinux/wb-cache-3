So, unlike other areas of mathematical cryptology even a novice can acquire, with modest effort, a good understanding of not only the potential applications, but also the underlying mathematics of lattice cryptography.

We propose here an improved complexity analysis dedicated to quadratic systems. Whilst the principle of the hybrid approach is simple, its careful analysis leads to rather surprising and somehow unexpected results. We prove that the optimal trade-off (i. e. num- ber of variables to be fixed) allowing to minimize the complexity is achieved by fixing a number of variables proportional to the number of variables of the system considered, denoted n. Under some nat- ural algebraic assumption, we show that the asymptotic complexity of the hybrid approach is 2 ^{n(3. 31 − 3. 62 log_ 2 (q)) }, where q is the size of the field (under the condition in particular that log(q) 2). We have been able to quantify the gain provided by the hybrid approach compared to a direct Gröbner basis method. For quadratic systems, we show (assuming a natural algebraic as- sumption) that this gain is exponential in the number of variables.

40|$|Although <b>mathematical</b> <b>cryptography</b> {{has been}} widely used, its {{security}} has only been proven under certain assumptions such as the computational power of opponents. As an alternative, quantum communication, in particular quantum key distribution (QKD) can get around unproven assumptions and achieve unconditional security. However, the key generation rate of practical QKD systems is limited by device imperfections, excess noise from the quantum channel, limited rate of true random-number generation, quantum entanglement preparation, and/or post-processing efficiency. This dissertation contributes to improving the performance of quantum communication systems. First, it proposes a new continuous-variable QKD (CVQKD) protocol that loosens the efficiency requirement on post-processing, a bottleneck for long-distance CVQKD systems. It also demonstrates an experimental implementation of the proposed protocol. To achieve high rates, the CVQKD experiment uses a continuous-wave local oscillator (CWLO). The excess noise caused by guided acoustic-wave Brillioun scattering (GAWBS) is avoided by a frequency-shift scheme, resulting in a 32 dB noise reduction. The statistical distribution of the GAWBS noise is characterized by quantum tomography. Measurements show Gaussian statistics upto 55 dB of dynamical range, which validates the security calculations in the proposed CVQKD protocol. True random numbers are required in quantum and classical cryptography. A second contribution of this thesis is that it experimentally demonstrates an ultrafast quantum random-number generator (QRNG) based on amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). Random numbers are produced by a multi-mode photon counting measurement on ASE light. The performance of the QRNG is analyzed with quantum information theory and verified with NIST standard random-number test. The QRNG experiment demonstrates a random-number generation rate at 20 Gbits/s. Theoretical studies show fundamental limits for such QRNGs. Quantum entanglement produced in nonlinear optical processes can help to increase quantum communication distance. A third contribution is the research on nonlinear optics of graphene, a novel 2 D material with unconventional physical properties. Based on a quantum-dynamical model, optical responses of graphene are derived, showing {{for the first time}} a link between the complex linear optical conductivity and the quantum decoherence. Nonlinear optical responses, in particular four-wave mixing, is studied for the first time. The theory predicts saturation effects in graphene and relates the saturation threshold to the ultrafast quantum decoherence and carrier relaxation in graphene. For the experimental part, four-wave mixing in graphene is demonstrated. Twin-photon production in graphene is under investigation.
