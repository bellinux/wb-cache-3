It {{is an extension of}} the well known INFOMAX method, in two directions: (1) handling of nonlinear mixtures, and (2) learning the nonlinearities to be used at the outputs. The method can therefore separate linear and nonlinear mixtures of components {{with a wide range of}} statistical distributions. This paper presents the basis of the MISEP method, as well as experimental results obtained with it. The results illustrate the applicability of the method to various situations, and show that, although the nonlinear blind separation problem is ill-posed, use of regularization allows the problem to be solved when the nonlinear <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> relatively <b>smooth...</b>|$|R

The chemical, optical, and structural {{properties of the}} films, {{as well as their}} stability under long exposition to humid atmosphere, were analyzed by x-ray photoelectron, infrared, and Raman spectroscopies; scanning and transmission electron microscopies; and optical transmittance spectrophotometry. It was found that the BN films grown on the anode using the B 2 H 6 -H 2 -NH 3 <b>mixture</b> <b>were</b> <b>smooth,</b> dense, adhered well to substrates, and had a textured hexagonal structure with the basal planes perpendicular to the film surface. These films were chemically stable to moisture, even after an exposition period of two years. In contrast, the films grown on the anode from the B 2 H 6 -N 2 mixture showed tensile stress failure and were very unstable in the presence of moisture. However, the films grown on the cathode from B 2 H 6 -H 2 -NH 3 gases suffered from compressive stress failure on exposure to air; whereas with B 2 H 6 -N 2 gases, adherent and stable cathodic BN films were obtained with the same crystallographic texture as anodic films prepared from the B 2 H 6 -H 2 -NH 3 <b>mixture.</b> These results <b>are</b> discussed in terms of the origin of film stress, the effects of ion bombardment on the growing films, and the surface chemical effects of hydrogen atoms present in the gas discharge...|$|R

The pre-mixed PCBM with cesium carbonate demonstrated a strikingly strong effect on {{the organization of the}} film. Whereas films formed from pure PCBM solution were rough due to strong inter-molecular interactions, the films formed from the <b>mixture</b> <b>were</b> much <b>smoother.</b> This indicates that the cesium carbonate moderates the inter-molecular interactions among PCBM molecules, hinting that the cesium diffusion observed in inverted organic photovoltaics and the likely ensuing ionic Cs-PCBM interaction decreases aggregation tendency of PCBM. This implies that the use of cesium salts affects the morphology of the organic layer and consequently improves the efficiency of these devices...|$|R
40|$|Context. As {{revealed}} by high-resolution spectral investigations in the wavelength range between 300 and 400 nm, the interstellar extinction curve does not display {{any of the}} sharp electronic absorption bands that are characteristic for large polyatomic molecules, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which belong to the most abundant interstellar molecules. Aims. We aim to verify whether the absorption curves of mixtures of medium-sized PAHs produced in the laboratory can explain the astronomical observations. Methods. The PAH <b>mixtures</b> <b>were</b> synthesized by infrared laser pyrolysis and subsequent chemical extraction and size separation. The matrix isolation technique was used to study the absorption spectra of isolated molecules at low temperature. Results. Our experimental results demonstrate that the UV-visible absorption curves of PAH <b>mixtures</b> can <b>be</b> very <b>smooth,</b> displaying no sharp bands, if the molecular diversity is sufficiently high. Conclusions. In view {{of the absence of}} sharp electronic features on the interstellar extinction curve for 300 < λ < 400 nm, we conclude from our experimental findings that the interstellar PAH population must be very diverse. The low fractional abundances of individual species prevent their detection on the basis of spectral fingerprints in the UV. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of two additives—poly(ethylene glycol) (MW 200) (PEG 200) alone and {{a mixture of}} PEG 200 and benzylideneacetone (PEG 200 /BDA) —on the mechanism of Zn electroreduction and the morphological characteristics of the coatings obtained was studied. A study of the adsorption of additive molecules onto a Fe electrode surface at the open circuit potential (EOCP) using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) disclosed that both PEG 200 and PEG 200 /BDA were adsorbed on the electrode, with a higher mass increase being observed for the system with PEG 200 /BDA. Cyclic voltammetry showed that the adsorption of PEG 200 /BDA partially inhibited the electroreduction of Zn at E =- 1. 12 V vs. SCE. This inhibition caused {{an increase in the}} overpotential for the discharge of Zn(II) ions, resulting in two reduction processes with different energies. A study of the reduction kinetics revealed that for both the PEG 200 and PEG 200 /BDA systems, the adsorption of additive molecules onto the electrode surface caused a decrease in the exchange current density (i 0), which made the kinetics of the process slower. When PEG 200 or PEG 200 /BDA was present in the electrolytic bath, the values of αc were slightly lower; this effect is associated with differences in the morphologies of coatings grown in the presence of additive molecules. The coatings grown {{in the presence of the}} PEG 200 /BDA additive <b>mixture</b> <b>were</b> compact, <b>smooth</b> and shiny materials comprised of flakes grouped in hemispherical clusters of uniform size...|$|R
