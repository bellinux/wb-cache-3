But as Slater prepares to have the charge sheets typed up, Del offers a deal: he will give Slater the name of the thief, provided he, Rodney, and Grandad are granted immunity from prosecution in writing and released without charge. Realising how much leverage being an informant would give him over Del in future, Slater readily agrees. With all the paperwork drawn up and signed by the Superintendent, Rodney and Grandad are led back into the interview room to see a desperate-looking Del as he prepares to sign it. He tells them of his predicament, explaining he {{has no choice but to}} co-operate, with he and Rodney facing the possibility of long prison sentences and Grandad being alone on the estate. He signs it and is asked by Slater: [...] "Who nicked the microwave?" [...] After further reassurances of his immunity from prosecution, Del confesses that he himself was the thief. A gleeful Del points at his immunity document as a horrified Slater looks on.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{examines}} malfunction {{and destruction}} of semiconductors by high power microwaves. The experiments employ a waveguide and a magnetron to study the influence of high power <b>microwaves</b> <b>on</b> TTL/CMOS IC inverters. The TTL/CMOS IC inverters are composed of a LED circuit for visual discernment. A CMOS IC inverter damaged by a high power microwave is observed with power supply current and delay time. When the power supply current was increased 2. 14 times for normal current at 10 kV/m, the CMOS inverter was broken by latch-up. The CMOS inverter damaged by latch-up returned its original level of functioning, because parasitic impedance inside the chip increased with the elapse of time. Three different types of damage were observed by microscopic analysis: component, onchipwire, and bondwire destruction. Based on the results, TTL/CMOS IC inverters {{can be applied to}} database to elucidate the effects of <b>microwaves</b> <b>on</b> electronic equipment. 1...|$|R

40|$|Microwaves are {{non-ionizing}} {{electromagnetic waves}} with frequencies between 0. 3 and 300 GHz. Both humans and microorganisms {{living on the}} human body are exposed to significant doses of microwave radiation in everyday life. Whether and how microwave radiation could influence the viability and growth of microorganisms {{is the subject of}} this educational paper. Studies on the effects of <b>microwaves</b> <b>on</b> the growth of microbial cultures were searched for in biomedical journals indexed in MEDLINE from 1966 to 2012. The published studies showed that microwaves produce significant effects on the growth of microbial cultures, which vary from the killing of microorganisms to enhancement of their growth. The nature and extent of the effect depend on the frequency of microwaves and the total energy absorbed by the microorganisms. Low energy, low frequency microwaves enhance the growth of microorganisms, whereas high energy, high frequency microwaves destroy the microorganisms. However, neither the effects of a wide spectrum of frequencies nor the effects of a wide range of absorbed energies have been investigated. Considering the potentially deleterious influence of <b>microwaves</b> <b>on</b> the symbiotic balance between microorganisms and the human host, further research on the effects of the complete frequency and energy spectra of <b>microwave</b> radiation <b>on</b> the growth of microorganisms is necessary...|$|R
