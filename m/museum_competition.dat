"Bernard Tschumi (The Manhattan Transcripts) For me, after studying several years, architecture has become religion. The architecture design {{is no longer a}} creation but has become a discovery journey. The way to see and think is as important as design. This thesis is not going to show how I design, but how I see, how I think and how I understand the architecture. The aim of this thesis is {{to find a way to}} rethink architecture by examining the communication between observers, architecture and architect. By introducing the hypothesis of a communicative model, a structure that consists of the object and subject which involve in the interactive relationship needs to be addressed. For this purpose, structuralism linguistics is introduced to implement the analysis of the architecture. The structuralism linguistics directly deals with the interaction between object and subject. By the study, an ideological conclusion is presented, which I call projection. The second part is Guandong <b>Museum</b> <b>Competition,</b> which is completed when I worked in Eisenman Architects. As an example, this project not only shows the design, but also shows the relationships between several intertwined systems. The third part of this thesis is The Highline competition project which is my first attempt to implement the projection idea in the design. By applying the meaning layer structure derived from linguistics, the design offers a new architectural perception which is based on the understanding of the interactions between objects and subjects.
