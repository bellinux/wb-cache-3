5000|$|In ammonia {{production}} CO and CO2 are considered poisons to {{most commonly used}} catalysts. <b>Methanation</b> catalysts are added after several ammonia synthesis steps to prevent carbon oxide buildup as methane does not have similar adverse effects on ammonia synthesis rates.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrumentation}} {{and process}} control complexity requirements are relatively high. The {{advantage of this}} technique over selective <b>methanation</b> is the higher space velocity, which reduces the required reactors size.

5000|$|<b>Methanation</b> {{reaction}} over different carried metal catalysts including Ni, Ru [...] and Rh {{has been}} widely investigated {{for the production of}} CH4 from syngas and other power to gas initiatives.

50|$|In April 2014 the European Union’s co-financed {{and from}} the KIT coordinated HELMETH (Integrated High-Temperature ELectrolysis and <b>METHanation</b> for Effective Power to Gas Conversion) {{research}} project started. The objective of the project is the proof of concept of a highly efficient Power-to-Gas technology by thermally integrating high temperature electrolysis (SOEC technology) with CO2-methanation. Through the thermal integration of exothermal <b>methanation</b> and steam generation for the high temperature steam electrolysis a conversion efficiency > 85% is expected (higher heating value of produced methane per used electrical energy). The process consists of a pressurized high-temperature steam electrolysis and a pressurized CO2-methanation module which are planned to be coupled in 2016. A methane output of approximately 30 kW (higher heating value) is targeted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methanation</b> as a {{means of}} {{producing}} synthetic natural gas has been considered since the 1970s. More recently it has been considered as a way to store energy produced from solar or wind power. This would also allow it to serve as a potential carbon capture mechanism.|$|E

50|$|Indirect coal {{liquefaction}} (ICL) processes operate in two stages. In the first stage, coal is converted into syngas (a purified mixture of CO and H2 gas).

The methane /SNG may then be fed into the natural gas grid or further converted in to LPG by synthesising SNG with partial reverse hydrogenation at high pressure and low temperature. LPG in turn can be converted into alkylate which is a premium gasoline blending stock because it has exceptional antiknock properties and gives clean burning.
