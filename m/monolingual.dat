5|$|The Gaelic Revival of {{the early}} twentieth century has had a {{long-term}} influence. There is now an extensive network of urban Irish speakers (Gaeilgeoirí) in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast. They represent an expanding demographic, with their own schools (called Gaelscoileanna) and their own social media. It has been argued that they tend to be more highly educated than <b>monolingual</b> English speakers, with better employment prospects and higher social status. Recent research suggests that urban Irish is developing in a direction of its own, both in pronunciation and grammar. Irish is also taught in mainstream English-speaking schools as a compulsory subject, but has been criticised for its ineffectiveness.|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that early bilinguals and <b>monolinguals</b> use different brain areas when performing nonlinguistic executive control tasks. For this, we explored brain activity of early bilinguals and <b>monolinguals</b> during a manual stop-signal paradigm. Behaviorally, bilinguals and <b>monolinguals</b> did not show {{significant differences in the}} task, which led us to compare brain activation that cannot be attributed to differences in performance. Analyses demonstrated that <b>monolinguals</b> activated the anterior cingulate cortex more than bilinguals when performing the stop-signal task. These results offer direct support for the notion that early bilingualism exerts an effect on neural circuitry responsible for executive control. Consistent with recent reports, we found that bilinguals used the anterior cingulate more efficiently than <b>monolinguals</b> to monitor nonlinguistic cognitive conflicts...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the behavioral and brain responses (ERPs) of {{bilingual word recognition}} to three fundamental psycholinguistic factors, frequency, morphology, and lexicality, in early bilinguals vs. <b>monolinguals.</b> Earlier behavioral studies have reported larger frequency effects in bilingualś nondominant vs. dominant language and in some studies also when compared to corresponding <b>monolinguals.</b> In ERPs, language processing differences between bilinguals vs. <b>monolinguals</b> have typically {{been found in the}} N 400 component. In the present study, highly proficient Finnish-Swedish bilinguals who had acquired both languages during childhood were compared to Finnish <b>monolinguals</b> during a visual lexical decision task and simultaneous ERP recordings. Behaviorally, we found that the response latencies were overall longer in bilinguals than <b>monolinguals,</b> and that the effects for all three factors, frequency, morphology, and lexicality were also larger in bilinguals even though they had acquired both languages early and were highly proficient in them. In line with this, the N 400 effects induced by frequency, morphology, and lexicality were larger for bilinguals than <b>monolinguals.</b> Furthermore, the ERP results also suggest that while most inflected Finnish words are decomposed into stem and suffix, only <b>monolinguals</b> have encountered high frequency inflected word forms often enough to develop full-form representations for them. Larger behavioral and neural effects in bilinguals in these factors likely reflect lower amount of exposure to words compared to <b>monolinguals,</b> as the language input of bilinguals is divided between two languages...|$|R

5|$|South of Ardnamurchan, Gaelic {{place names}} are more common, {{and after the}} 13th century, Gaelic became the main {{language}} of the entire Hebridean archipelago. Due to Scots and English being favored in government and the educational system, the Hebrides {{have been in a}} state of diglossia since at least the seventeenth century. The Highland Clearances of the nineteenth century accelerated the language shift away from Scottish Gaelic, as did increased migration and the continuing lower status of Gaelic speakers. Nevertheless, as late {{as the end of the}} nineteenth century, there were significant populations of <b>monolingual</b> Gaelic speakers, and the Hebrides still contain the highest percentages of Gaelic speakers in Scotland.

For example, the towns of San Rafael de Velasco, San Miguel de Velasco, Santa Ana de Velasco and San Ignacio de Velasco have functioning town councils (cabildos), and the caciques and the sexton still retain their capacities. The {{majority of the population}} of the Chiquitania is staunchly Catholic; the Chiquitano cosmovision is now only a dimly understood mythology for its inhabitants. Between 1992 and 2009, the populations of San Xavier and especially Concepción tripled, and more than doubled in San Ignacio de Velasco, now the region’s fastest-growing municipality. In other mission towns the population also increased, albeit on a smaller scale. As of 2011, San José de Chiquitos, San Xavier and Concepción have around 10,000inhabitants each; and San Ignacio de Velasco, the largest town in the Chiquitania, has about 35,000 and is now boasts a campus of a national university. On the other hand, in Santa Ana de Velasco there are currently only a few hundred people. The remoter settlements of Santiago de Chiquitos and Santo Corazón are quite small as well. According to various sources, in Bolivia the number of ethnic Chiquitanos is between 30,000 and 47,000 of which less than 6,000– mainly elderly people– still speak the original language.

40|$|Bilingual {{children}} sometimes show delays {{relative to}} <b>monolinguals</b> on language tasks. In the present studies, we explored whether French–English bilinguals’ tense use and shift would show a developmental lag {{in the context}} of narration. In Study 1, we showed that both French and English <b>monolinguals</b> showed age-related changes in tense use, with preschoolers preferring the past and adults the present. A developmental lag among bilingual children could therefore take the form of prolonged use of the past tense through middle childhood. In Study 2, we observed tense use in the narratives of French–English bilingual children (8 – 10 years), as well as French and English <b>monolinguals</b> from the same age group. The bilinguals tended to use more present tense than the <b>monolinguals.</b> In qualitative analyses, bilinguals also used a multitude of expressive strategies, such as exclamations, repetitions and onomatopoeia, that made the stories more vivid. Taken together these results suggest that French–English bilinguals do not present developmental differences from <b>monolinguals</b> in tense use. Instead, they adopt an imagistic narrative style that differs from the <b>monolinguals</b> in multiple ways, including a greater use of the present tense. The adoption of this style might be linked to both bilingualism and a cultural preference among French–English bilinguals...|$|R

50|$|It is a well-replicated {{finding that}} bilinguals have a smaller {{vocabulary}} size than their <b>monolinguals</b> counterparts. Given that bilinguals accumulate vocabulary from both their languages, when taking both languages into account, {{they have a}} much larger vocabulary than <b>monolinguals.</b> However, within each language bilinguals have a smaller vocabulary size and take longer to name pictures as seen in standardized vocabulary tests, such as the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and Boston Naming task. A possible explanation {{may be that the}} frequency of use of words is related to increased lexical accessibility, meaning that words that are used more frequently are accessed more quickly. Therefore, bilinguals may be 'less proficient' relative to <b>monolinguals,</b> purely because they use one sole language less frequently than <b>monolinguals,</b> who use the same language all the time. In addition, the need to select the appropriate language system makes ordinary linguistic processing more effortful. The simple act of retrieving a common word is more effortful for bilinguals than <b>monolinguals</b> due to the competition of the two languages.|$|R

The Dutch language had a low social prestige in Belgium at the time, and knowledge of French was considered necessary for social advancement, and Dutch-speakers suffered discrimination. The massive shift from Dutch to French was underway by the late 19th century.

25|$|In the {{language}} mode framework, language processing mechanisms and languages {{as a whole}} can be achieved to different extents. The relative activation state of language is called language mode, and it is influenced by many factors, such as the person spoken or listened to, users’ language proficiency, the nonlinguistic context and so on. Language users can be in a bilingual mode if they are talking to other bilinguals or reading text with mixed languages. However, if they listen {{to someone who is}} <b>monolingual</b> or is just speaking one language, the activation state would switch to a more <b>monolingual</b> mode.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that even highly-proficient Spanish-English bilinguals, who {{acquired}} their second language (L 2) in childhood and have little or no foreign accent in English, may require more acoustic information than <b>monolinguals</b> in order to identify English vowels and may have more difficulty than <b>monolinguals</b> in understanding speech in noise or reverberation (Mayo, Florentine, and Buus, 1997; Febo, 2003). One explanation that may account for this difference is that bilingual listeners use acoustic cues for vowel identification differently from <b>monolinguals</b> (Flege, 1995). In this study, we investigated this hypothesis by comparing bilingual listeners use of acoustic cues to vowel identification to that of <b>monolinguals</b> for six American English vowels presented under listening conditions created to manipulate the acoustic cues of vowel formant dynamics and duration. Three listener groups were tested: <b>monolinguals,</b> highly proficient bilinguals, and less proficient bilinguals.

The resynthesized stimuli were created using high-fidelity synthesis procedures (Straight; Kawahara, Masuda-Katsuse, and Cheveigne 1998) and digital manipulation.
