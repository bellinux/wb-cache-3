The site of the brick freight depot, closed in 1969 and demolished in 1975, is now owned by Greyhound Lines, which uses it as an intercity bus terminal. A track built in 1887 crossed Court Street, connecting with the Little Miami Railroad's Eggleston Avenue Connection for freight transfer. The line began by climbing the Deer Creek Valley, the only feasible rail entrance to downtown Cincinnati that did not follow a river valley. When the railroad was built in the late 1870s, the valley was used by the city as a dump. An 1852 city ordinance provided for raising the ground level, beginning with the raising of Court Street by as much as [...] To follow the eventual surface level and avoid the steep hillsides, the railroad was built on trestles for much of its ascent, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>grade</b> of 3.5%. After leaving the depot, the line traversed an S-shaped trestle to the east side of the valley, before crossing Elsinore Place and Eden Park Drive at grade, with a second trestle between these streets. (The former was replaced in January 1889 with a straighter single-track trestle.) A bridge took the line over Florence Avenue, and it then passed through the neighborhood of Mount Auburn before passing under the summit through the cut-and-cover Oak Street Tunnel north of McMillan Street. The line started its gradual descent as it left the tunnel, generally following the existing ground level and crossing streets at grade.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to growing}} {{consumption}} of nickel (Ni) {{in a range}} of industries, the demand for Ni has increased rapidly around the world. This trend requires a more precise estimation of available Ni grade deposits and an identification of factors controlling the grade distribution. To achieve these requirements, this study applies geostatistical techniques to spatial modeling of the Ni grade in a laterite Ni deposit, with reference to geomorphic features such as slope gradient and the thickness of limonite and saprolite zones. The Sorowako area in Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, was chosen as a case study area because it has a representative laterite Ni deposit with large reserves. Chemical content data from drillhole cores at 294 points were used for the analysis. The slope gradient was found to have a remarkable correlation with the thickness of the limonite zone, but there was no correlation between the thickness of the limonite and the saprolite zones above the bedrock. One important feature was a general correlation between the thickness of the saprolite zone and the <b>maximum</b> Ni <b>grade</b> in this zone: the grade increases with the thickness of the zone. Co-kriging was adopted to incorporate this correlation into estimating the <b>maximum</b> Ni <b>grade</b> in the saprolite zone. As a result, the <b>maximum</b> Ni <b>grade</b> in the saprolite zone tends to be high mainly in areas of slight slope. The Ni accumulation at this topographic feature probably originates from deep weathering by groundwater infiltrating through well-developed rock fracture...|$|R
