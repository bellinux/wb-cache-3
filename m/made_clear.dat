5|$|After Mussolini had <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> in 1922 that {{he would}} never give up the region of South Tyrol from being in Italy, Hitler adopted this position. Hitler in Mein Kampf had {{declared}} that concerns over the rights of Germans in South Tyrol under Italian sovereignty was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German-Italian alliance with Mussolini's Fascist regime. In Mein Kampf Hitler also <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> that he was opposed to having a war with Italy for the sake of obtaining South Tyrol. This position by Hitler of abandoning German land claims to South Tyrol produced aggravation among some NSDAP members who up to the late 1920s found it difficult to accept the position.|$|E

5|$|British {{architect}} Frederick Gibberd {{published a}} diagrammatic comparison of Durham Cathedral alongside a power station {{typical of the}} design of the time, like the one planned at Kepier.

It was argued that as long as the two structures were viewed simultaneously, the visual juxtaposition would be detrimental to the Cathedral. Somewhat ironically, Gibberd's Didcot Power Station would later be voted the third worst eyesore in Britain in 2003.|$|E

After leaving the Browns, Jones moved back to Ruston and did occasional scouting for the team at the nearby Grambling State University. He was also a volunteer coach of receivers on Grambling's football team. Later in life, he worked for his son Tom's general contracting business in Ruston.|$|E

5|$|The Belgian {{position}} on any offensive move was <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> by Leopold III. As {{far as he}} was concerned, the Belgian Army could not conduct offensive operations as it lacked tanks and aircraft; it existed solely for defence. The King also <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> that in the rapidly shrinking area of Belgium still free, there was only enough food for two weeks. Leopold did not expect the BEF to jeopardize its own position in order to keep contact with the Belgian Army, but he warned the British that if it persisted with the southern offensive the Belgians would be overstretched and their army would collapse. King Leopold suggested the best recourse was to establish a beach-head covering Dunkirk and the Belgian channel ports. The will of the CIGS won out. Gort committed just two infantry battalions and the only armoured battalion in the BEF to the attack, which despite some initial tactical success, failed to break the German defensive line at the Battle of Arras on 21 May.|$|E
