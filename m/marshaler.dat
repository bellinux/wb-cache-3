5000|$|A blittable type is a {{data type}} {{that does not}} require special {{attention}} from the interop <b>marshaler</b> because by default it has a common representation in managed and unmanaged memory. By pinning the data in memory, the garbage collector will be prevented from moving it, allowing it to be shared in-place with the unmanaged application. This means that both managed and unmanaged code will alter the memory locations of these types in a consistent manner, and much less effort is required by the <b>marshaler</b> to maintain data integrity. The following are some examples of blittable types available in the [...]NET framework: ...|$|E
5000|$|This very {{restrictive}} {{notion of}} blittable types appears {{to limit the}} usefulness of the interoperability services provided by [...]NET, but this is not so. While blittable types allow a straightforward definition of interoperable types, various ways exist to explicitly define how a non-blittable type should be converted by the interop <b>marshaler.</b> For example, in the [...]NET languages there are many attributes which can be applied to fields in types, to types themselves and to method parameters to indicate to the <b>marshaler</b> how to handle those particular data. These attributes have various purposes, such as detailing the packing or alignment of a type, specifying offsets of fields in a type, specifying array or string representations, controlling parameter-passing style for function calls, specifying memory management techniques, and more. If none of the attributes or other tools that are provided in the framework are adequate, fine-grained control is provided by the ability to implement the [...] interface and manually perform the conversion of data in both directions. Complete coverage of interoperation between managed and unmanaged code is out of the scope of this discussion, so please refer to the See Also section for more information. However, understanding what constitutes a blittable type allows a developer to identify situations where intervention is and is not required for a type to be correctly marshaled. In this way, less time is wasted on over-specification of types or function calls.|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} (un) marshaling {{framework is}} presented. It {{is designed for}} distributed applications implemented in languages such as C++. A marshaler/unmarshaler pair converts arbitrary structured data between its host and network representations. This technology {{can also be used}} for persistent storage. Our framework simplifies the design of efficient and flexible <b>marshalers.</b> The network latency is reduced by concurrent execution of (un) marshaling and network operations. The framework is actually used in Mozart, a distributed programming system that implements Oz, a multi-paradigm concurrent language. Mozart, including the implementation of the framework, is available at [URL]...|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, {{one-dimensional}} {{arrays of}} these types (including unsafe fixed buffers) as well as complex types containing only instance fields (which includes readonly fields) {{of these types}} are blittable. The presence of static or const fields that are non-blittable does not cause the type to become non-blittable, because such fields play no part in marshalling. Complex types (that is structs or classes) must also have instance field layout of Sequential applied using the StructLayout attribute {{in order to be}} considered blittable by the [...]net <b>marshaler.</b> Structs have this attribute applied automatically by the compiler, but you must explicitly add it to a class definition if you want an otherwise blittable class to be blittable.|$|E

Most often, for a given data structure, the <b>marshaler</b> and the unmarshaler are tightly related pieces of code that are synthesized conjunctly. This paper proposes a new point of view: the unmarshaler is considered as a byte-code interpreter evaluating a stream of bytes considered as a program i. e., a sequence of commands interspersed with quoted raw data. This program {{is an expression of}} the marshaling language. From that point of view, the <b>marshaler</b> logically appears as a compiler translating values into expressions of the marshaling language...|$|E

In the practical part of the research carried out in nursery school with a focus on awareness among educators, about the issue of emotional intelligence and its <b>marshaler</b> into the educational process. The method used is qualitative observations made supplemented by interviews with individual teachers.

This asymmetry and programmatic view has far-reaching consequences: (i) it is simple to accommodate new dynamically created classes of data, (ii) it is possible to have simultaneously various marshalers that offer different, even evolving, strategies in order to cope with different situations such as network congestion or processor memory exhaustion. 1. The Context According to the taxonomy of Distributed Shared Memory [5], DMEROON is a library of functions allowing objects to be shared over the Internet in a coherent way among multiple readers and, at most, one writer. Management is distributed and coherency is causal. Coherency is out of the scope of this paper [6] and so are many details of DME-ROON [7]. The DMEROON project started as the memory layer supporting a distributed language [9] but it soon tried to be a portable common layer for different languages (currently C and Scheme) to exchange, copy or share typed structured values...|$|E
