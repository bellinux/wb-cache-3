40|$|In the past, {{acceleration}} sensors {{have mostly}} {{been used for}} measurements of earthquakes or in aerospace applications. In recent years they have found new applications {{in the fields of}} machine monitoring and diagnostic. The automobile sector is another new application area for acceleration sensors, e. g. as a colision sensor for airbags or for driving safety control systems. The application of acceleration sensors in heavy and large machines has not been researched yet. Silicon <b>micromechanic</b> delivers decisive advantages. <b>Micromechanic</b> acceleration sensors with on-chip readout circuits can detect small signals and translate them into an interference-proof signal, such as a digital data format. Micromechanical sensors are produced in batch fabrication, with low cost and consistently high performance. In this work a sensor system has been developed that meets the special requirements of heavyload manipulation systems. The geometrical structure of the sensor has been adapted to the acceleration range of large manipulators. In addition, a new almost exclusively digital readout circuit has been developed. This special circuit allows the measurement of high precision accelerations during regular operation, but can also detect very high accelerations (shock), e. g. those generated by the collision of the manipulator with another object.

50|$|Given the (linear and/or nonlinear) {{material}} {{properties of the}} constituents, one important goal of <b>micromechanics</b> of materials consists of predicting {{the response of the}} heterogeneous material {{on the basis of the}} geometries and properties of the individual phases, a task known as homogenization. The benefit of homogenization is that the behavior of a heterogeneous material can be determined without resorting to testing it. Such tests may be expensive and involve a large number of permutations (e.g., in the case of composites: constituent material combinations; fiber and particle volume fractions; fiber and particle arrangements; and processing histories). Furthermore, continuum <b>micromechanics</b> can predict the full multi-axial properties and responses of inhomogeneous materials, which are often anisotropic. Such properties are often difficult to measure experimentally, but knowing what they are is a requirement, e.g., for structural analysis involving composites. To rely on <b>micromechanics,</b> the particular <b>micromechanics</b> theory must be validated through comparison to experimental data.|$|E

40|$|Simplified {{equations}} {{are presented}} for the elastic properties of randomly oriented short fiber-glass composites. The suggested equations for the Young’s modulus, the shear modulus and the Poisson ratio {{are given in}} terms of the fiber-glass content and the Young’s moduli of the constit-uents. The equations are applicable for fiber-glass volume fractions in the range 0. 1 to 0. 4. The theoretical results are compared with experimental values, and the achieved good correlation, shows the utility of the pro-posed approximations. SCOPE N RECENT YEARS, much work has been done on both elastic and strength be-Ihavior of polymeric materials reinforced with randomly oriented discontinuous fibers. In most cases, the prediction of these properties were based on the classical laminate analogy: the material is constructed from a large number (> 3) or an infinite number of orthotropic plies oriented in all directions. This model, coupled with the usual <b>micromechanic</b> formulation, gives complex equations for ~’, G and v which are difficult to use in practice. In this study, the classical laminate analogy [1, 2] is used in conjunction with invariants defined by Tsai and Pagano [3], and with Puck’s <b>micromechanic</b> formu-lation [4]. Numerical approximations become possible, by linking the range of fiber-glass volume content to 0. 1 - 0. 4. This range includes practically almost all of the short fiber-glass composites made by the usual fabrication methods. The approximate equations are compared with both exact theory and experi-mental results from tensile, flexure and torsion tests...|$|R
