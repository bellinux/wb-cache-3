50|$|In <b>many</b> <b>calorie</b> {{restriction}} studies, it {{is believed}} that Sir2 mediates the longevity effects from calorie restriction for several reasons. First, it was found that in yeast without SIR2, calorie restriction did not impart longevity in yeast; second, in Sir2 mutants an abundance of extra-chromosomal ribosomal DNA circles (that typically limit lifespan) has been observed, and that mitigation of these circles restore regular life span, but still are resistant to calorie restriction-mediated longevity; third, that caloric restriction increases the activity of Sir2 in vivo. Although Sir2 has been implicated in calorie restriction-mediated longevity, the method by which Sir2 is regulated under caloric restriction is still debated.|$|R

These habits include eating on the run, eating large portions, skipping meals, and late night eating. These habits are considered to be bad for various reasons. Eating on the run usually happens when a person is busy and does not have the time to cook a healthy meal. The result usually ends in fast and unhealthy meals as the food of choice. Eating on the run also causes a person to eat quickly usually causing one to eat larger portions in order for the hunger to be satisfied.

50|$|It has {{sometimes}} been suggested that the lives of calorie-restricted animals are only extended relative to control animals whose lives are artificially shortened by weight-gain from unnatural ad libitum feeding in the laboratory. However, studies designed {{to test this hypothesis}} suggest that reduced fat mass is not a major contributor to the longevity effects of calorie restriction. The strongest evidence comes from a study in which ob/ob mice, which are genetically prone to overeating and obesity, were compared to lean mice of the same genetic background but lacking the ob/ob mutation. When placed on calorie restriction, the ob/ob mice still have over twice the fat mass of ad libitum-fed congenic lean mice, and yet they have double the lifespan. Additionally, <b>many</b> modern <b>calorie</b> restriction studies restrict the control animals by 10-20% below their ad libitum intake in order to avoid confounding by obesity.|$|R

[...] Fundamental to the K-ration's inadequacy was its ration allowance, rigorously standardized at one ration per man per day.

40|$|Reduced {{function}} {{mutations in}} the insulin/IGF-I signaling pathway increase maximal lifespan and health span in <b>many</b> species. <b>Calorie</b> restriction (CR) decreases serum IGF- 1 concentration by ~ 40 %, protects against cancer and slows aging in rodents. However, {{the long-term effects}} of CR with adequate nutrition on circulating IGF- 1 levels in humans are unknown. Here we report data from two long-term CR studies (1 and 6 years) showing that severe CR without malnutrition did not change IGF- 1 and IGF- 1 : IGFBP- 3 ratio levels in humans. In contrast, total and free IGF- 1 concentrations were significantly lower in moderately protein-restricted individuals. Reducing protein intake from an average of 1. 67 g kg(- 1) of body weight per day to 0. 95 g kg(- 1) of body weight per day for 3 weeks in six volunteers practicing CR resulted in a reduction in serum IGF- 1 from 194 ng mL(- 1) to 152 ng mL(- 1). These findings demonstrate that, unlike in rodents, long-term severe CR does not reduce serum IGF- 1 concentration and IGF- 1 : IGFBP- 3 ratio in humans. In addition, our data provide evidence that protein intake is a key determinant of circulating IGF- 1 levels in humans, and suggest that reduced protein intake may become an important component of anticancer and anti-aging dietary interventions...|$|R

40|$|Enhanced stress {{response}} has been suggested to promote longevity in <b>many</b> species. <b>Calorie</b> restriction (CR) and conserved nutrient-sensing target of rapamycin (TOR) and protein kinase A (PKA) pathways have also been suggested to extend life span by increasing {{stress response}}, which protects cells from age-dependent accumulation of oxidative damages. Here we show that deleting the yeast 14 - 3 - 3 protein, Bmh 1, extends chronological life span (CLS) by activating the stress response. 14 - 3 - 3 proteins are highly conserved chaperone-like proteins that play important roles in many cellular processes. bmh 1 Δ-induced heat resistance and CLS extension require the general stress-response transcription factors Msn 2, Msn 4, and Rim 15. The bmh 1 Δ mutant also displays a decreased reactive oxygen species level and increased heat-shock-element-driven transcription activity. We also show that BMH 1 genetically interacts with CR and conserved nutrient-sensing TOR- and PKA-signaling pathways to regulate life span. Interestingly, the level of phosphorylated Ser 238 on Bmh 1 increases during chronological aging, which is delayed by CR or by reduced TOR activities. In addition, we demonstrate that PKA can directly phosphorylate Ser 238 on Bmh 1. The status of Bmh 1 phosphorylation is therefore likely to play important roles in life-span regulation. Together, our studies suggest that phosphorylated Bmh 1 may cause inhibitory effects on downstream longevity factors, including stress-response proteins. Deleting Bmh 1 may eliminate the inhibitory effects of Bmh 1 on these longevity factors and therefore extends life span...|$|R

40|$|Stevioside is a {{diterpene}} glycoside {{present in}} Stevia Rebaudiana leaves {{that has the}} ability to sweeten at rated between 70 to 350 times than sucrose (0. 4 % w/v). It has no calorific value. Unlike <b>many</b> low <b>calorie</b> sweeteners, stevioside is stable at high temperature. The objective of this research is to extract stevioside from stevia rebaudiana leaves by using cellulase from Aspergillus Niger. Acetate buffer and ethanol were used as a medium for enzyme and as a solvent, respectively. In this present study, the enzymatic extraction of stevioside from stevia rebaudiana leaves was carried out using cellulase with various parameters that affect the production of stevioside such as concentration of enzyme, incubation time and temperature. Cellulase was observed to give the highest stevioside yield (16230 ± 0. 3 μg/ml) at 40 oC. This indicated that the maximum temperature for cellulase activity was 40 oC. The results signify that the enzymatic extraction method is an alternative to solvent based stevioside extraction, based on its higher efficiency. Thus, it can be concluded that the extraction of stevioside from Stevia rebaudiana leaves using cellulase can be maximized under the maximum conditions for the cellulase activity where the used of solvent can be minimized in degrading the cell wall Together with the maximum heat and correct combination of the solvent used, a new and efficient way of extracting high yield of stevioside can be obtained...|$|R

5000|$|With annual costs {{exceeding}} $10 thousand, the respiration calorimeter {{was considered}} a dream project for the 19th century. Atwater began the first of about 500 experiments in 1896. In fact, [...] "he made history by establishing America’s first state agricultural experiment station at Wesleyan." [...] He studied respiration and metabolism in animals and in humans. The calorimeter aided studies in food analysis, dietary evolution, work energy consumption, and digestible foods. It measured the human metabolism balance by analyzing the heat produced and metabolic rate by a person performing certain physical activities. With this machine, the dynamics of metabolism could be quantified and the balance between food intake and energy output could be measured. Atwater applied the {{first law of thermodynamics}} to his research: Energy can be transformed (i.e., changed from one form to another), but it can neither be created nor destroyed. Before Atwater's development of the respiration calorimeter, <b>many</b> experiments on <b>calorie</b> intake and expenditure had been conducted on animals. During this period, there was a widely held belief that the first law of thermodynamics applied to animals, but did not apply to humans because they were unique. Atwater demonstrated that whatever amount of consumed energy humans cannot use is left over and stored in the body. His findings thus established that the first law applied to humans as well as animals. Atwater's research and conclusions in this regard changed both how people thought about science and about humans.|$|R
