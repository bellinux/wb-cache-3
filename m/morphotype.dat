A cladistic analysis performed by Varricchio and Barta (2015) (pictured below) found Gobioolithus to be a sister taxon to Styloolithus. However, they considered Styloolithus different enough from Gobioolithus to warrant its excluslion from Gobioolithidae.|$|E

5|$|The {{synonyms}} {{are other}} binomial names that were given {{over time to}} this taxon by authors who were unaware that the specimens they were describing belonged to a species already described by Linnaeus; in some cases, local variations in colour and form may have misled these authors into thinking they had a different species. Strombus vanicorensis is a subsequent, changed spelling of Strombus vanikorensis {{by one of the}} original authors. There is some disagreement in the literature {{as to whether or not}} this taxon and the similar-looking Laevistrombus turturella are actually separate species. Leo Man In 'T Veld and Koenraad de Turck (1998) considered that L.canarium and L.turturella are distinct (yet sympatric) species, based mainly on the shell morphology and a radula comparison. However, when Zaidi Che Cob reviewed a number of Strombus species in 2009, examining both shell characters and anatomical data including details of the genitalia, operculum and radula, he concluded that L.turturella was simply a <b>morphotype,</b> and therefore a synonym of L.canarium.|$|E
40|$|In {{a survey}} of the {{endophytic}} fungi from Pinus tabulaeformis in northeast China, approximately 11 % of isolates did not produce spores, although various techniques were employed to promote sporulation. These sterile mycelia were grouped into 74 <b>morphotypes</b> based on similar cultural characters. Arrangement of isolates into <b>morphotypes</b> does not reflect species phylogeny, and therefore they were further identified based on phylogenetic analysis of the 5. 8 S gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS 1 and ITS 2) regions, as well as sequence similarity comparison. Sequence analyses indicated that five <b>morphotypes</b> were Basidiomycota, while the other 69 <b>morphotypes</b> were Ascomycota. Further analyses resulted in two <b>morphotypes</b> being identified as Fusarium sporotrichioides and Schizophyllum commune. Twenty-two <b>morphotypes</b> were identified to generic level, seven to family (Lophiostomataceae and Valsaceae) level, and four to order (Helotiales and Pezizales) level. The 74 <b>morphotypes</b> were classified into 64 taxa, which indicates a high diversity of fungi on Pinus. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|We discuss, {{from the}} aspect of phylogeny, the interrelationships of the phytolith types in plants from the main taxonomical groups (algae, lichens, horsetails, gymnosperms, and floral plants) with homologues of known {{proteins}} of biomineralization. Phytolith <b>morphotypes</b> in various phylogenetic plant domains have different shapes. We found that, in ancient types of plants (algae, horsetails, and gymnosperms), there are fewer different phytolith <b>morphotypes</b> compared to more modern plants (floral plants). The phytolith <b>morphotypes</b> in primitive plants are generally larger than the <b>morphotypes</b> in more highly organized plants. We found that the irregular ruminate and irregular smooth <b>morphotypes</b> {{are the two most}} frequently encountered phytolith <b>morphotypes</b> in the tested plants (from algae to floral plants). These two <b>morphotypes</b> probably have a universal role. Silacidins, silicon transporters, silicateins, silaffins, and silicase homologues are often found in the major taxonomic groups of plants. Red algae had the smallest number of homologues of the biomineralization proteins (70 – 80), Monocotyledonous: 142, Coniferous: 166, Mosses: 227, and Dicotyledones: 336...|$|R
40|$|The {{variability}} in the chronology of the vegetative and reproductive development of weedy rice complex has been little studied. However, a field trial was established to study the timing of growth stages of sixteen weedy rice <b>morphotypes</b> and five rice varieties of Costa Rica. Weedy rice presented {{a wide range of}} variation for all descriptors among and within <b>morphotypes.</b> Weedy rice was taller than the rice varieties during vegetative phase and showed a growth increase of 14 - 23 cm every two weeks. Six <b>morphotypes</b> emerged earlier than commercial rice varieties, but no differences where found between samples for the time required for starting tillering. Early emergence of weedy rice <b>morphotypes</b> was not associated with early flowering, thus no correlation was detected between the vegetative and reproductive phases. All weedy rice <b>morphotypes</b> reached anthesis and maturity earlier than the rice varieties. Nevertheless, varieties Setesa- 9 and CR- 5272 overlapped anthesis with eleven <b>morphotypes</b> and variety CR- 4338 overlapped flowering with eight weedy rice <b>morphotypes.</b> In contrast, none of the <b>morphotypes</b> overlapped anthesis with varieties CR- 1821 and CR- 1113.

In China, the typical <b>morphotype</b> of Oncomelania hupensis is ribbed-shelled, and its distribution is restricted to Yangtze River basin.

25|$|The European jackal is {{the largest}} of the golden jackals, with animals of both sexes {{measuring}} 120–125cm (47–49in) in total length and 10–13kg (20–29lb) in body weight. One adult male in North-Eastern Italy is recorded to have reached 14.9kg (33lb). The fur is coarse, and is generally brightly coloured with blackish tones on the back. The thighs, upper legs, ears and forehead are bright reddish chestnut. Jackals in Northern Dalmatia have broader than average skulls, which is thought to result from human induced isolation from other populations, thus resulting in a new <b>morphotype.</b>|$|E

In the same year, the Polish paleontologist Karol Sabath reviewed the entire collection of fossil eggs discovered on the Polish expeditions, including the not-yet-named Gobioolithus eggs. Following Elżanowski, he referred them to Gobipteryx, though only tentatively because at the time ongoing studies of similar eggs found on the Soviet expeditions cast doubt on this classification.|$|E
40|$|Premise of the study: To {{study the}} genetic {{structure}} among three <b>morphotypes</b> of an African rainforest tree species, Santiria trimera, nuclear microsatellite markers were isolated and characterized. Methods and Results: Seven polymorphic loci were isolated using a pyrosequencing-based protocol and successfully amplified on three different <b>morphotypes</b> of S. trimera. For {{six of the}} seven loci, {{there is at least}} one private allele for one of the three <b>morphotypes.</b> The mean effective number of alleles is about four for each of the three <b>morphotypes.</b> Conclusions: These microsatellite markers are promising to explore the genetic delimitation among sympatric <b>morphotypes</b> found in Gabonese forests and to study the spatial genetic structure within each gene pool. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.

500|$|C. squamiferum is {{the type}} species and the sole species within the genus Chrysomallon.

Warén et al. classified this species in the family Peltospiridae, within the Neomphalina in 2003. Molecular analyses based on sequences of cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) genes confirmed the placement of this species within the Peltospiridae.

40|$|The Senna artemisioides species {{complex is}} characterised by {{extremely}} variable foliar morphology. This paper {{presents the results}} of an integrative study on reproductive biology, morphology and genetic variation to explore the evolutionary and systematic relationships within this species complex at Idalia National Park in central Queensland. Senna artemisioides showed discontinuous variation at both genetic and phenotypic level. At three sites, foliar morphology was discontinuous, being represented as discrete clusters. Analysis of isozyme variation indicated that many of the discrete morphological groups are distinguished by fixed genetic differences. <b>Morphotypes</b> were also characterised by widespread monomorphism. Most of the genetic variation was between <b>morphotypes</b> rather than within <b>morphotypes.</b> These fixed genetic differences indicate a lack of gene flow between <b>morphotypes</b> and therefore an absence of hybridisation. The two most distinct morphological groups (pyllodinous, pinnate) had high genetic distances of 0. 5, a value beyond the usual distance between congeneric species. Forty-two percent of pairwise comparisons between other <b>morphotypes</b> yielded genetic distance values that were relatively high (0. 21 - 0. 42). Some phenotypically distinct <b>morphotypes,</b> however, showed little or no isozyme divergence. The combined evidence suggests that genetically distinct <b>morphotypes</b> are independent lineages originating from an ancestral sexual reproductive event that is perpetuated by apomictic reproduction...|$|R
40|$|Fruits {{of fifteen}} <b>morphotypes</b> of Carica papaya of “sunrise solo” was {{evaluated}} {{to determine their}} nutritive characteristics, phenotypic and genotypic variability {{as well as the}} heritability and expected genetic advance of the nutritive traits. The result indicated that the moisture content was high among the <b>morphotypes</b> and differed significantly (p< 0. 01). Protein values were significantly different among the <b>morphotypes</b> and ranged from 0. 293 to 0. 82 %.

The mineral and vitamin contents of the <b>morphotypes</b> also varied significantly from one another (p< 0. 01). High thiamine content was observed in Pear red fruits while vitamin C content was high in oblong yellow fruits. The variability observed in these traits were more of genetic nature than non-genetic and indicates that there is considerable scope for selections in the <b>morphotypes.</b> High heritability and genetic advance was observed in crude fibre, ash, calcium, sodium, protein and riboflavin indicating that selection for these traits can be effective for their improvement...|$|R

Comparisons were made with the epimural communities observed at 12 well-distributed sites in the rumen of a mature wether. Epimural bacteria were already present on the epithelium at 1 week of age. The morphological composition of the epimural community changed with age, with the pattern of succession being similar in both groups of lambs.
