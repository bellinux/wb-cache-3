2500|$|In the UK an ‘employee’ has all {{available}} rights (all {{the rights of}} a ‘worker’ but also child care, retirement and job security rights). The meaning is explicitly left to the common law under the main statute, the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 230, and has developed according to the classical 19th century contrast between a contract ‘of service’ and one ‘for services’. The government may also pass secondary legislation to include specific groups of people into the ‘employee’ category. While the classical test was that an employee was subject to a sufficient degree of ‘control’, new forms of work where people have greater autonomy in how to perform their jobs, meant that, particularly from the mid-20th century, additional tests of employment were developed. Different expressions were used, including how much one could said to be ‘integrated’ into the business, or whether one metaphorically wore the ‘badge’ of the organisation. The focus {{was said to be}} on ‘economic reality’, and form over substance. Multiple relevant factors would include how much the employee was ‘controlled’, if they owned their tools, if they had the chance of profit, or bore the risk of loss. But in the late 1970s and 1980s, some courts began to speak of a new test of ‘mutuality of obligation’. The dominant view of this, now approved by the UK Supreme Court, was merely that workers exchanged work for a wage: an irreducible core of an employment contract. Another view stated that the employment relationship had to be one where there was an ongoing obligation to offer and accept work. This led to cases where employers, typically of people on low wages and little legal understanding, pleaded that they had only hired a person on a casual basis and thus should not be entitled to the major job security rights. However, the leading case, Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher decided by a unanimous Supreme Court in 2011, adopted the view that <b>mutuality</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> is the consideration of work for a wage, brought the definition of an employment contract in line with that in used in the EU. Confirming that employment contracts are one of a specific type, and separate from commercial agreements, Lord Clarke held that an exchange of work for a wage was essential.

40|$|The renewed {{interest}} {{in the concept of}} the psychological contract has come to the fore in attempts to describe, understand and predict the consequences of changes occurring in the employment relationship. Recognising that the employment relationship includes two parties to the exchange process, we set out to examine the content and state of the psychological contract from both the employee and employer perspective. The two perspectives permit an examination <b>of</b> the <b>mutuality</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations,</b> which has not received much empirical attention to date. The research methodology consists of two surveys conducted in a large local authority directly responsible and accountable for a range of public services including education, environmental health and social care to the local population. The key findings suggest that the majority of employees have experienced contract breach. This view is also supported by managers, as representatives of the employer, who further indicate that the organization, given its external pressures, is not fulfilling its obligations to employees {{to the extent that it}} could. Overall, the results indicate that employees are redressing the balance in the relationship through reducing their commitment and their willingness to engage in organizational citizenship behaviour when they perceive their employer as not having fulfilled its part in the exchange process...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{psychology}} and psychotherapy for some, {{has become a}} functional religion. Certain Christian scholars have employed deontological ethics <b>of</b> <b>mutuality</b> and <b>obligation</b> to critique the implicit ethical egoist perspective of humanistic, Jungian and ego psychologies as scholars such as Don Browning believe that therapists and pastoral counselors have appropriated clinical psychologies without examining their implicit ethical egoist orientations. They believe that an ethic of generativity best exemplifies the fit between modern {{psychology and}} Christian theology. So-called "generative man" is the preferred archetype to "productive man" or "psychological man. " However, the aretaic ethics of individuation and self-actualization have paradoxical utilitarian benefits for the community. It is argued {{that the process of}} narcissism associated with individuation is necessary before one can authentically embrace a deontological ethic <b>of</b> <b>mutuality...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court of Oklahoma {{affirmed the}} verdict for the {{plaintiff}}.

The court held that the contract did have <b>mutuality</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> because the contract constrained Price's discretion. Price was required to buy all the sand that he would sell from McMichael, so if he {{wanted to be in the}} sand business he was bound to buy from McMichael. The court noted that Price was an experienced sand salesmen, and that while the parties were in business Price was making a profit.|$|E

5000|$|Under UK law a {{distinction}} is drawn between a mere [...] "worker" [...] and an [...] "employee," [...] an employee having more legal rights than a worker. Whether a person working under a zero-hour contract is an employee or a worker can be uncertain; however, {{even in cases}} where the plain text of the zero-hour contract designates the person as a [...] "worker" [...] courts have inferred an employment relationship based on the <b>mutuality</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> between employer and employee.Thus, when deciding whether a zero-hours contract constitutes a contract of employment, conferring employee status, the wording of the contract will not be determinative of whether there is, in practice, a <b>mutuality</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation.</b> The tribunal will look closely at the reality of the agreement. If the reality {{is that there is a}} pattern of regular work which is regularly accepted, the tribunal may deem the contract to be one of employment.|$|E

This meant she was not even an employee, and so that whether or not she was in fact fairly dismissed, under the ERA 1996 sections 94 and 230 she had no right to claim at all. Mrs James argued that this was a perverse finding, {{and the fact that she}} was an employee was the only one that matched the practical reality of the work relationship.|$|E
5000|$|Government {{procurement}} in the United States is {{the process}} by which the Federal Government of the United States acquires goods, services (notably construction), and interests in real property. Contracts for Government procurement usually involve appropriated funds spent on supplies, services, and interests in real property by and {{for the use of the}} Federal Government through purchase or lease, whether the supplies, services, or interests are already in existence or must be created, developed, demonstrated, and evaluated. See 48 C.F.R. § 2.101 ("Acquisition" [...] defined, as to goods and services only). Federal Government contracting has the same legal elements as contracting between private parties: a lawful purpose, competent contracting parties, an offer, an acceptance that complies with the terms of the offer, <b>mutuality</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation,</b> and consideration. However, Federal contracts are much more heavily regulated, subject to volumes of statutes dealing with Federal contracts and the Federal contracting process, mostly in Titles 10, 31, 40, and 41 of the United States Code.|$|E

40|$|In this article, Professor Allen Blair {{examines}} the preeminent role of exclusivity in open-quantity contracts under the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”). Although {{the text of}} the UCC does not mandate that open-quantity contracts be exclusive, the vast majority of courts considering the issue have held that exclusivity is necessary to prevent such contracts from failing for lack of <b>mutuality</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation.</b> The Article traces the historic development of open-quantity agreements, focusing on pre-Code cases recognizing the commercial utility of such agreements but struggling with how to accommodate them under a classical model of contract formation. It was in this historic context that courts forged the requirement of exclusivity. Despite the fact that the UCC was intended to supplant rigid notions of contract formation, thus expanding the range of legally enforceable commercial agreements, post-Code courts have remained con- strained by classic contract law and still require exclusivity. This Article argues that by demanding exclusivity in open-quantity agreements, the majority of courts have relied on an outmoded conception of contract formation, which unduly restricts commercial deal-making and ignores the relational benefits {{at the heart of the}} UCC and Karl Llewellyn’s concept of agreement...|$|E
40|$|As states enact immigration-related laws {{requiring}} {{local law}} enforcement officers to identify and detain undocumented immigrants, the Fourth Amendment rights of aliens are becoming critically important. In United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, a divided Supreme Court suggested that aliens in the United States do not have Fourth Amendment rights unless they have established 2 ̆ 2 substantial connections 2 ̆ 2 to the United States. Lower courts have relied on Verdugo 2 ̆ 7 s holding to categorically deny Fourth Amendment rights to certain classes of undocumented immigrants. Commentators have criticized the 2 ̆ 2 substantial connections 2 ̆ 2 test as an isolated misinterpretation of Court precedent regarding the rights of aliens within the United States. This Article, however, takes a new approach. It analyzes Verdugo {{in the context of}} the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of aliens 2 ̆ 7 constitutional rights both inside and outside the United States. In doing so, this Article identifies the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s evolving approach to membership and highlights Verdugo 2 ̆ 7 s pivotal role in the development of that approach. This Article suggests that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s increasing extension of membership rights to aliens outside the United States and denial of membership rights to aliens within the United States is evidence of an emerging 2 ̆ 2 post-territorial 2 ̆ 2 approach to membership that rejects territorial presence as an accurate measure of membership. Rather, the post-territorial approach looks to more substantive indicators of membership, including community ties and <b>mutuality</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation,</b> to afford rights. Ultimately, this Article examines Verdugo 2 ̆ 7 s progeny through a post-territorial lens and concludes that lower courts that categorically deny certain classes of undocumented immigrants Fourth Amendment rights violate Verdugo 2 ̆ 7 s post-territorial mandate by failing to evaluate the claimant 2 ̆ 7 s substantive indicators of membership...|$|E

40|$|This Master thesis {{deals with}} the {{comparison}} of trade relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> in Germany and the Czech Republic. In order to introduce and analyse the topic thoroughly at first the main legal acts connected with relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> and trade relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> in both compared countries are being introduced. The main stress is put {{on the content of}} these legal acts, on their historical development, their application methods as well as on their mutual relationship. The next part of this Master thesis then explains the term trade relationship <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> with respect to the definitions obtained in both compared legal systems. After the theoretical introduction the general legal regulation of the trade relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> is being characterised. Since the general legal regulation of the trade relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> is based on the general legal regulation of the relationships <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> at first the differences between these two legal regulations in Germany are explained.
