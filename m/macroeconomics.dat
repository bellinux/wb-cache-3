5|$|<b>Macroeconomics</b> descends {{from two}} areas of research: {{business}} cycle theory and monetary theory. Monetary theory {{dates back to}} the 16th century and the work of Martín de Azpilcueta, while business cycle analysis dates from the mid 19th.|$|E
5|$|The General Theory {{is often}} viewed as the {{foundation}} of modern <b>macroeconomics.</b> Few senior American economists agreed with Keynes through most of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|As of the {{awarding}} of the 2017 prize, 49 Nobel Memorial Prizes in Economic Sciences {{have been given to}} 79 individuals. Up to 2007, nine awards had been given for contributions to the field of <b>macroeconomics,</b> more than any other category. The institution with the most affiliated laureates in economic sciences is the University of Chicago, which has 29 affiliated laureates.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and 1980s, new Keynesian {{researchers}} investigated how market imperfections like monopolistic competition, nominal frictions like sticky prices, and other frictions made microeconomics consistent with Keynesian <b>macroeconomics.</b> New Keynesians often formulated models with rational expectations, {{which had been}} proposed by Lucas and adopted by new classical economists.|$|E
5|$|Milton Friedman {{developed}} {{an alternative to}} Keynesian <b>macroeconomics</b> eventually labeled monetarism. Generally monetarism {{is the idea that}} the supply of money matters for the macroeconomy. When monetarism emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, Keynesians neglected the role money played in inflation and the business cycle, and monetarism directly challenged those points.|$|E
5|$|Modern <b>macroeconomics</b> {{can be said}} to {{have begun}} with Keynes and the {{publication}} of his book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in 1936. Keynes expanded on the concept of liquidity preferences and built a general theory of how the economy worked. Keynes's theory was brought together both monetary and real economic factors for the first time, explained unemployment, and suggested policy achieving economic stability.|$|E
5|$|New {{classical}} economics {{had pointed}} out the inherent contradiction of the neoclassical synthesis: Walrasian microeconomics with market clearing and general equilibrium could not lead to Keynesian <b>macroeconomics</b> where markets failed to clear. New Keynesians recognized this paradox, but, while the new classicals abandoned Keynes, new Keynesians abandoned Walras and market clearing.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{departments}} are {{headed by the}} commissioners. The lower rank staff is composed of 84% Russian officials, 10% Kazakhs and 6% Belarusians, proportional to the populations of the member states. The departments enable the Board of the Eurasian Commission to make decisions not only with regard to customs policies, but {{in such areas as}} <b>macroeconomics,</b> regulation of economic competition, energy policy and financial policy. The Commission departments are also involved in government procurement and labour migration control.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} disciplines, the initial {{emphasis}} of feminist economists was to critique the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches. The critique began in microeconomics {{of the household}} and labor markets and spread to <b>macroeconomics</b> and international trade, ultimately extending to all areas of traditional economic analysis. Feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis, broadened the focus on economics and sought pluralism of methodology and research methods.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis's collegiate {{scene is}} {{dominated}} by the main campus of the University of Minnesota where more than 50,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students attend 20 colleges, schools, and institutes. The graduate school programs ranked highest in 2007 were counseling and personnel services, chemical engineering, psychology, <b>macroeconomics,</b> applied mathematics and non-profit management. A Big Ten school and home of the Golden Gophers, the University of Minnesota is the fourth largest campus among U.S. public 4-year universities in terms of enrollment.|$|E
5|$|New classicals {{broke with}} Keynesian {{economic}} theory completely while monetarists had built on Keynesian ideas. Despite discarding Keynesian theory, new classical economists did share the Keynesian focus on explaining short-run fluctuations. New classicals replaced monetarists {{as the primary}} opponents to Keynesianism and changed the primary debate in <b>macroeconomics</b> from whether to look at short-run fluctuations to whether macroeconomic models should be grounded in microeconomic theories. Like monetarism, new classical economics was rooted at the University of Chicago, principally with Robert Lucas. Other leaders {{in the development of}} new classical economics include Edward Prescott at University of Minnesota and Robert Barro at University of Rochester.|$|E
5|$|Basic Guides were {{formerly}} {{issued for}} students which, unlike the Resource Guides, {{remained the same}} from year to year. The Art Basic Guide focuses on art fundamentals, such as the elements of art, principles of composition, and different 2-D and 3-D techniques. Additionally, a brief introduction to art history is included. The Economics Basic Guide reviews fundamental economic concepts {{in addition to the}} basics of <b>macroeconomics</b> and microeconomics. The Language and Literature Basic Guide provides students with a basic grounding in the analysis of literature and introduces key terms such as synecdoche, metonymy, assonance, and aphorism. The Math Basic Guide offers a general overview of major topics in high school math, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics. The Music Basic Guide begins by introducing the student to topics in music theory such as harmonics, rhythm, tempo, and the circle of fifths. It also includes information {{on a wide variety of}} instruments and a brief history of Western music. However, beginning in the 2010–2011 competition season, the Basic Guides were incorporated into the year's Resource Guides.|$|E
5|$|In general, the {{objective}} events follow a set organizational outline {{from year to}} year. Language and literature focuses on a single novel or a set of plays in addition to multiple short literary selections {{which tend to be}} poems or excerpts from short stories. The art and music sections include several selections with which students must familiarize themselves in addition to historical information. Economics remains fairly static; 85% of the material focuses on a standard course of <b>macroeconomics</b> and microeconomics and the remaining 15% focuses on the year's topic. For example, in 2005 the themed material covered the economics of ancient Egypt and Rome. Science and social science reflect the season's theme. Unlike the other events, there is no basic information that carries over. The math curriculum has varied as well, occasionally dropping and adding new subjects or shifting the weight of particular subjects.|$|E
5|$|Keynesians and monetarists {{recognized}} that people based their economic decisions on {{expectations about the}} future. However, until the 1970s, most models relied on adaptive expectations, which assumed that expectations were based on an average of past trends. For example, if inflation averaged 4% over a period, economic agents were assumed to expect 4% inflation the following year. In 1972 Lucas, influenced by a 1961 agricultural economics paper by John Muth, introduced rational expectations to <b>macroeconomics.</b> Essentially, adaptive expectations modeled behavior {{as if it were}} backward-looking while rational expectations modeled economic agents (consumers, producers and investors) who were forward-looking. New classical economists also claimed that an economic model would be internally inconsistent if it assumed that the agents it models behave as if they were unaware of the model. Under the assumption of rational expectations, models assume agents make predictions based on the optimal forecasts of the model itself. This did not imply that people have perfect foresight, but that they act with an informed understanding of economic theory and policy.|$|E
5|$|The new {{classical}} school {{culminated in}} real business cycle theory (RBC). Like early classical economic models, RBC models assumed that markets clear and that business cycles {{are driven by}} changes in technology and supply, not demand. New Keynesians tried to address many of the criticisms leveled by Lucas and other new classical economists against Neo-Keynesians. New Keynesians adopted rational expectations and built models with microfoundations of sticky prices that suggested recessions could still be explained by demand factors because rigidities stop prices from falling to a market-clearing level, leaving a surplus of goods and labor. The new neoclassical synthesis combined elements of both new classical and new Keynesian <b>macroeconomics</b> into a consensus. Other economists avoided the new classical and new Keynesian debate on short-term dynamics and developed the new growth theories of long-run economic growth. The Great Recession led to a retrospective {{on the state of}} the field and some popular attention turned toward heterodox economics.|$|E
5|$|Monetarism {{attracted}} the attention of policy makers in the late-1970s and 1980s. Friedman and Phelps's version of the Phillips curve performed better during stagflation and gave monetarism a boost in credibility. By the mid-1970s monetarism had become the new orthodoxy in <b>macroeconomics,</b> and by the late-1970s central banks in the United Kingdom and United States had largely adopted a monetarist policy of targeting money supply instead of interest rates when setting policy. However, targeting monetary aggregates proved difficult for central banks because of measurement difficulties. Monetarism faced a major test when Paul Volcker took over the Federal Reserve Chairmanship in 1979. Volcker tightened the money supply and brought inflation down, creating a severe recession in the process. The recession lessened monetarism's popularity but clearly demonstrated the importance of money supply in the economy. Monetarism became less credible when once-stable money velocity defied monetarist predictions and began to move erratically in the United States during the early 1980s. Monetarist methods of single-equation models and non-statistical analysis of plotted data also lost out to the simultaneous-equation modeling favored by Keynesians. Monetarism's policies and method of analysis lost influence among central bankers and academics, but its core tenets of the long-run neutrality of money (increases in money supply cannot have long-term effects on real variables, such as output) and use of monetary policy for stabilization became a part of the macroeconomic mainstream even among Keynesians.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} this is <b>macroeconomics.</b> In the 1960s and 1970s, <b>macroeconomics</b> {{was a part of the}} core of the subject. Why? Because <b>macroeconomics</b> was not only {{sufficiently}} important to be part of any economist's training, but also embodied a set of concepts and principles not found in microeconomic theory. However the replacement of Keynesian approach to <b>macroeconomics</b> with new classical <b>macroeconomics</b> and its successors, <b>macroeconomics</b> might now be regarded by the mainstream as merely an application of microeconomic theory.|$|E
25|$|In micro{{economics}}, neoclassical economics represents {{incentives and}} costs as playing a pervasive {{role in shaping}} decision making. An immediate {{example of this is}} the consumer theory of individual demand, which isolates how prices (as costs) and income affect quantity demanded. In <b>macroeconomics</b> it is reflected in an early and lasting neoclassical synthesis with Keynesian <b>macroeconomics.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, various Austrians {{incorporated}} {{models and}} mathematics into their analysis. Austrian economist Steven Horwitz argued in 2000, that Austrian methodology {{is consistent with}} <b>macroeconomics</b> and that Austrian <b>macroeconomics</b> can be {{expressed in terms of}} microeconomic foundations. Austrian economist Roger Garrison writes that Austrian macroeconomic theory can be correctly expressed in terms of diagrammatic models. In 1944, Austrian economist Oskar Morgenstern presented a rigorous schematization of an ordinal utility function (the Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem) in Theory of Games and Economic Behavior.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{developments}} were {{against the backdrop of}} improvements in both econometrics, that is the ability to measure prices and changes in goods and services, as well as their aggregate quantities, and in the creation of <b>macroeconomics,</b> or the study of whole economies. The attempt to combine neo-classical microeconomics and Keynesian <b>macroeconomics</b> would lead to the neoclassical synthesis which has been the dominant paradigm of economic reasoning in English-speaking countries since the 1950s. Hicks and Samuelson were for example instrumental in mainstreaming Keynesian economics.|$|E
25|$|Economist Mark Blaug {{has criticized}} over-reliance on methodological individualism, arguing it would rule out all {{macroeconomic}} propositions that cannot {{be reduced to}} microeconomic ones, and hence reject almost the whole of received <b>macroeconomics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{at least}} the 1960s, <b>macroeconomics</b> has been {{characterized}} by further integration as to micro-based modelling of sectors, including rationality of players, efficient use of market information, and imperfect competition. This has addressed a long-standing concern about inconsistent developments of the same subject.|$|E
25|$|The Journal of Applied Economics publishes {{original}} contributions on applied {{issues in}} micro and <b>macroeconomics.</b> The primary criteria for selecting papers are {{quality and importance}} for the field. Papers based on a well motivated research problem that make a concrete contribution to empirical economics or applied theory are especially encouraged.|$|E
25|$|Frisch {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of {{economics}} as a modern science. He made a number of significant advances in the field of economics and coined a number of new words including econometrics and <b>macroeconomics.</b> His 1926 paper on consumer theory helped set up Neo-Walrasian research. He formalized production theory (1965).|$|E
25|$|Within <b>macroeconomics</b> there is, {{in general}} {{order of their}} {{appearance}} in the literature; classical economics, Keynesian economics, the neoclassical synthesis, post-Keynesian economics, monetarism, new classical economics, and supply-side economics. Alternative developments include ecological economics, constitutional economics, institutional economics, evolutionary economics, dependency theory, structuralist economics, world systems theory, econophysics, feminist economics and biophysical economics.|$|E
25|$|Other topics include {{imperfect}} competition in <b>macroeconomics,</b> nominal rigidity. Most {{of his work}} is New Keynesian. Dixon supports the High Speed 2 development for the United Kingdom, and expressed his support in a Financial Times article on 6 January 2012, along with other leading economists. He has contributed to The Times Higher Education Supplement multiple times regarding economics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Macroeconomics</b> {{influenced}} the neoclassical synthesis {{from the other}} direction, undermining foundations of classical economic theory such as Say's Law, and assumptions about political economy such as the necessity for a hard-money standard. These developments are reflected in neoclassical theory by {{the search for the}} occurrence in markets of the equilibrium conditions of Pareto optimality and self-sustainability.|$|E
25|$|Greenwood–Hercowitz–Huffman {{preferences}} are a particular functional form of utility developed by Jeremy Greenwood, Zvi Hercowitz, and Gregory Huffman, in their 1988 paper Investment, Capacity Utilization, and the Real Business Cycle. It describes the macroeconomic impact of technological changes {{that affect the}} productivity of new capital goods. The paper also introduced the notions of investment-specific technological progress and capacity utilization into modern <b>macroeconomics.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1949, {{just before}} {{going off to}} Columbia he was offered and {{accepted}} an Assistant Professorship in the Economics Department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At M.I.T. he taught courses in statistics and econometrics. Solow's interest gradually changed to <b>macroeconomics.</b> For almost 40 years, Solow and Paul Samuelson worked together on many landmark theories: von Neumann growth theory (1953), theory of capital (1956), linear programming (1958) and the Phillips curve (1960).|$|E
25|$|Candidates for CAS and SOA {{membership}} {{must pass}} standardized tests in introductory economics and corporate finance. Candidates for SOA membership must pass an additional standardized test in applied statistics. Economics has two components: <b>macroeconomics</b> and microeconomics. Applied statistics has two components: regression and time series. Instead of passing exams, candidates may earn credit by passing an approved college {{class with a}} B- or better grade or by completing an approved correspondence class.|$|E
25|$|Speaking at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations {{conference in}} 2008, Aziz {{maintains}} his views that the Financial crisis occurred due to financial mismanagement, {{lack of understanding}} the <b>macroeconomics</b> principles and fragmented regulatory regimes in the world. In an interview with CNN, Aziz remains pessimist about Pakistan's approach to Free Trade Agreement with the United States in 2012 by judging the current relations with the United States and economical challenges faced by the country.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Robert Lucas of the Chicago {{school of}} {{economics}} introduced the Lucas critique, which called into question the logic behind Keynesian macroeconomic policy making. The new classical economics became the dominant school in <b>macroeconomics.</b> By the mid-1970s, policy makers were beginning to lose their confidence in the effectiveness of government intervention in the economy. In 1976 British Prime Minister James Callaghan said that the option of “spending {{our way out of}} recession” no longer exists.|$|E
25|$|In many areas, {{some form}} of price {{stickiness}} is postulated to account for quantities, rather than prices, adjusting {{in the short run}} to changes on the demand side or the supply side. This includes standard analysis of the business cycle in <b>macroeconomics.</b> Analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and their implications for reaching a hypothesized long-run equilibrium. Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and posted prices in markets deviating from perfect competition.|$|E
25|$|The Keynesian {{revolution}} is typically {{viewed as a}} major shift in <b>macroeconomics.</b> According to John Kenneth Galbraith, Say's Law dominated economic thought prior to Keynes for over a century, and the shift to Keynesianism was difficult. Economists who contradicted the law, which implied that underemployment and underinvestment (coupled with oversaving) were virtually impossible, risked losing their careers. In his magnum opus, Keynes cited one of his predecessors, John A. Hobson, who was repeatedly denied positions at universities for his heretical theory.|$|E
