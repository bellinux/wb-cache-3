DNA-raised antibody responses rise {{much more slowly}} than when natural infection or recombinant protein immunization occurs. As many as 12 weeks {{may be required to}} reach peak titres in mice, although boosting can decrease the interval. This response is probably due to the low levels of antigen expressed over several weeks, which supports both primary and secondary phases of antibody response. DNA vaccine expressing HBV small and <b>middle</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> was injected into adults with chronic hepatitis. The vaccine resulted in specific interferon gamma cell production. Also specific T-cells for middle envelop proteins antigens were developed. The immune response of the patients was not robust enough to control HBV infection ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe large L {{envelope}} protein of the hepatitis B virus has the peculiar capacity to adopt two transmembrane topologies. The N-terminal preS domain of L initially {{remains in the}} cytosol while the S domain is cotranslationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The preS region of {{about half of the}} L molecules is posttranslationally translocated to the lumenal space. We now demonstrate that the repression of cotranslational translocation of preS is conferred by a preS 1 -specific sequence. By analysis of L deletion mutants, the cytosolic anchorage determinant was mapped to amino acid sequence 70 to 94 of L. The intrinsic potential of this determinant to suppress cotranslational translocation was confirmed by transfer to the HBV <b>middle</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> In searching for cellular factors potentially involved in this novel process, we identified the cytosolic heat shock protein Hsc 70 as a specific binding partner of L. The interaction site(s) for the chaperone was mapped to amino acids 63 to 107 of L using coimmunoprecipitation andin vitrobinding analyses. Deletion of the cytosolic anchorage determinant almost completely abolished ATP-dependent Hsc 70 binding. Therefore, interaction between Hsc 70 and L is likely to be responsible for the suppression of cotranslational translocation of the preS domain...|$|E
40|$|Two plasmid DNA vectors, pCAGGS(S) {{encoding}} {{the genes}} of the major envelope protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV), and pCAGGS(S + preS 2) encoding {{the genes of}} the <b>middle</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> were used to study the mechanism and therapeutic potential of DNA-based immunization. Injection of these plasmids into the regenerating bilateral tibialis anterior muscle (TA) of normal C 57 BL/ 6 mice induced hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) -specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Seventy-two hours after injection of pCAGGS(S), infiltrating cells including antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DC) were localized around the injection site and HBsAg was expressed by both muscle cells and infiltrating cells. Spleen DC from the mice were exposed to HBsAg for up to 32 weeks after a single injection of pCAGGS(S), because these DC induced the proliferation of HBsAg-specific memory lymphocytes in culture without exogenous HBsAg. A single injection of pCAGGS(S) or pCAGGS(S + preS 2) resulted in the clearance of HBsAg in 28 out of 30 HBV-transgenic (Tg) mice. In contrast, more than 7 monthly injections of an HBsAg-based vaccine were required for the clearance of HBsAg in 6 out of 29 HBV-Tg mice. Infiltrating DC at the DNA vaccine injection site may {{have a role in}} initiating HBsAg-specific immune response, whereas the persistence of HBsAg exposed spleen DC may contribute to long-lasting immunity. This study also suggested that DNA-based vaccines may be a potent tool for treating chronic HBV carriers...|$|E

Cells {{infected with the}} recombinant adenovirus which contained the large envelope gene (HS 1.

No HBV <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> were detected in the culture medium from HS 1. HP-infected cells. Cells infected with recombinant adenovirus which contained the <b>middle</b> <b>envelope</b> gene (HS 2.

Cells infected with the recombinant adenovirus which contained the major envelope gene (HS.

Cells coinfected with a recombinant adenovirus which contained the large envelope gene and with either HS 2. HP or HS.

Secretion of the major and <b>middle</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> was inhibited more than 95 % {{by the presence of}} the large <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins.</b> These results suggest that differential biosynthesis, transport, and processing of the <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> occur during HBV infection, allowing efficient assembly and secretion of virions and hepatitis B surface antigen particles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNaturally {{occurring}} deletions {{within the}} human hepatitis B virus (HBV) preS 2 region have frequently {{been identified in}} patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while chronic carriers without cirrhosis and HCC contain no detectable preS 2 deletion variants. We have characterized two different preS 2 internal deletion variants from two patients. In addition to several weak phenotypes, our study revealed three unexpected strong phenotypes: (1) a paradoxical “hypermodification” phenomenon was observed with significantly increased size heterogeneity and molecular weights of the secreted <b>middle</b> (M) <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> containing a preS 2 internal deletion. This phenomenon was observed in transient transfection with a human hepatoma Huh 7 cell line {{as well as in}} stable transfection with a rodent hepatoma cell line 7777. (2) A significantly increased intracellular accumulation of all three <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> (large, <b>middle,</b> and small) was detected by both Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. (3) The <b>middle</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> with a preS 2 internal deletion were not recognized in vitro by a putative neutralizing antiserum, suggesting that these variants can evade immune recognition in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first identification and characterization of the M deletion variant protein in HBV natural infection...|$|R

The chimpanzee injected with 2 mg of DNA attained > 100 milli-international units/ml of anti-HBs antibody after one injection and 14, 000 milli-international units/ml after four injections. A smaller dose (400 microg) induced lower and transient titers, but a strong anamnestic response occurred 1 year later. Comparison with responses in 23 chimpanzees receiving various antigen-based HBV vaccines suggests that the DNA approach is promising for prophylactic immunization against HBV...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{study the}} pathway of {{degradation}} of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) <b>middle</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> (M), human hepatoblastoma cells were transfected with a plasmid that specifies production of M {{in the absence of}} other viral proteins. When expressed in HepG 2 cells, 90 % of M protein was secreted into the culture media within a 24 -h period. However, quite surprisingly, 10 % of this protein remained cell associated and was only slowly degraded over a 24 – 48 -h period. Treatment with inhibitors of the cytosolic proteasome complex resulted in the accumulation of full-length HBV M protein and M derived HBV-specific polypeptides of 20 and 17  kDa. Treatment with the endoglycosidases PNGase F and Endo H, confirmed that the two species were derived from a similar polypeptide with a N-linked glycan modification. Evidence that this peptide was derived from a proteolytic processing event was determined through the detection of the C-terminal fragment using a C-terminal tagged HA tagged construct. The hypothesis that the 20 and 17  kDa polypeptide species are intermediates of M degradation was reinforced by their detection in cells transfected with vectors specifying M secretion defective mutants that accumulate intracellular M. Moreover, deletion of a putative cleavage sites prevented the detection of the 20 and 17  kDa species, consistent with the notion that they are generated by the action of a cellular protease prior to proteasomal degradation. Thus, these results highlight an important way in which large protein aggregates, such as the HBsAg can be processed for efficient degradation via the proteasomes and allow for proper antigen presentation via the MHC I pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} between different genotypes of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) in co-infected patients remain largely unknown, especially in acute infection. Here, {{the evolution of}} HBV strains was studied in an acute, self-limited hepatitis B patient co-infected with genotypes Ba (B 2) and C. Virological analyses were performed at four time points after admission: T 1 (5 days), T 2 (11 days), T 3 (22 days) and T 4 (260 days). A dominant-genotype change from genotype C to Ba was found after anti-HBV e antigen (anti-HBe) seroconversion. Further clonal and phylogenetic analyses of the pre-S and pre-core/core regions of HBV were carried out to clarify the {{interactions between}} genotypes Ba and C. All clones propagated from T 1 and T 2 were of genotype C. In contrast, clones propagated from T 3 (after anti-HBe seroconversion) were of genotype Ba, C and/or recombinant within the pre-S region. At T 4, all clones were of genotype Ba with a 123 bp (from nt 3147 of the pre-S 1 region to nt 54 of the pre-S 2 region) in-frame pre-S deletion and had lost the start codon of the <b>middle</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> and the nucleocapsid-binding site. Phylogenetic analysis showed that genetic distance was greater at T 3 after seroconversion to anti-HBe. By using SimPlot, the breakpoint of one pre-S recombinant was located at nt 3069 – 3100 {{and the other two}} at nt 49 – 87. In conclusion, HBV genotype Ba may overtake genotype C as the predominant strain after anti-HBe seroconversion in acute hepatitis B. Recombination within the pre-S region emerged transiently and the pre-S deletion mutant was finally cleared...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{vaccines}} encoding a {{viral protein}} {{have been shown}} to induce antiviral immune responses and provide protection against subsequent viral challenge. In this study, we show that the efficacy of a DNA vaccine can be greatly improved by simultaneous expression of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2). Plasmid vectors encoding the major (S) or middle (pre-S 2 plus S) envelope proteins of hepatitis B virus (HBV) were constructed and compared for their potential to induce hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) -specific immune responses with a vector encoding the middle envelope and IL- 2 fusion protein or with a bicistronic vector separately encoding the <b>middle</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> and IL- 2. Following transfection of cells in culture with these HBV plasmid vectors, we found that the encoded major protein was secreted while the middle protein and the fusion protein were retained on the cell membrane. Despite differences in localization of the encoded antigens, plasmids encoding the major or middle proteins gave similar antibody and T-cell proliferative responses in the vaccinated animals. The use of plasmids coexpressing IL- 2 and the envelope protein in the fusion or nonfusion context resulted in enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses. In addition, the vaccine efficacy in terms of dosage used in immunization was increased at least 100 -fold by coexpression of IL- 2. We also found that DNA vaccines coexpressing IL- 2 help overcome major histocompatibility complex-linked nonresponsiveness to HBsAg vaccination. The immune responses elicited by HBV DNA vaccines were also modulated by coexpression of IL- 2. When restimulated with antigen in vitro, splenocytes from mice that received plasmids coexpressing IL- 2 and the envelope protein produced much stronger T helper 1 (Th 1) -like responses than did those from mice that had been given injections of plasmids encoding the envelope protein alone. Coexpression of IL- 2 also increased the Th 2 -like responses, although the increment was much less significant...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPreviously, we {{identified}} an HBV binding factor (HBV-BF), a 50 -kDa serum glycoprotein which interacts with HBV <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> {{and which is}} also located in the membrane of normal human hepatocyte (A. Budkowskaet al. (1993) J. Virol. 67, 4316). Here we show that HBV-BF is a neutral metalloproteinase which shares substrate specificity and properties with a newly described family of membrane type matrix metalloproteinases. HBV-BF treatment of the HBV resulted in the cleavage of the N-terminal part of the <b>middle</b> HBV <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> at the pre-S 2 (136 – 141) amino acid sequence VRGLYF/L (containing a single arginine cleavage site). HBV-BF affected the reactivity of the large HBV protein with pre-S 1 -specific MAbs, probably inducing the conformational change of the pre-S 1 domain. The HBV-BF-digested virus remained morphologically intact with unchanged S antigenic determinants. The structural modifications of the viral <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> induced by HBV-BF enabled cell membrane attachment and viral entry into the T-lymphocyte. Both processes were blocked by the metalloproteinase inhibitor 1, 10 phenanthroline. Thus, the host-dependent proteolytic activation of the <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> seems to be essential for the HBV entry into the cell. HBV-BF under a membrane bound or a secreted form could be (one of) the molecule(s) responsible for the HBV proteolytic activation...|$|R
40|$|The {{infectious}} {{particles of}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) and {{hepatitis delta virus}} (HDV) are coated with the large, <b>middle,</b> and small <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> encoded by HBV. While {{it is clear that}} the N-terminal pre-S 1 domain of the large protein, which is exposed at the virion surface, is implicated in binding to a cellular receptor at viral entry, the role in infectivity of the <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> antigenic loop, also exposed to the virion surface and accessible to neutralizing antibodies, remains to be established. In the present study, mutations were created in the antigenic loop of the three <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins,</b> and the resulting mutants were evaluated for their capacity to assist in the maturation and infectivity of HDV. We observed that short internal combined deletions and insertions, affecting residues 109 to 133 in the antigenic loop, were tolerated for secretion of both subviral HBV particles and HDV virions. However, when assayed for infectivity on primary cultures of human hepatocytes or on the recently described HepaRG cell line, virions carrying deletions between residues 118 and 129 were defective. Single amino acid substitutions in this region revealed that Gly- 119, Pro- 120, Cys- 121, Arg- 122, and Cys- 124 were instrumental in viral entry. These results demonstrate that in addition to a receptor-binding site previously identified in the pre-S 1 domain of the L protein, a determinant of infectivity resides in the antigenic loop of HBV <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> bear two {{determinants of}} viral entry: a receptor-binding site (RBS) in the pre-S 1 {{domain of the}} large <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> and a conformation-dependent determinant, of unknown function, in the antigenic loop (AGL) of the small, <b>middle,</b> and large <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins.</b> Using an in vitro infection assay consisting of susceptible HepaRG cells and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) as a surrogate of HBV, we first investigated whether subelements of the pre-S 1 determinant (amino acids 2 to 75), i. e., the N-terminal myristoyl anchor, subdomain 2 - 48 (RBS), and subdomain 49 - 75, were functionally separable. In transcomplementation experiments, coexpression of two distinct infectivity-deficient pre-S 1 mutants at the surface of HDV virions failed to restore infectivity, indicating that the myristoyl anchor, the 2 - 48 RBS, and the 49 - 75 sequence, likely cooperate in cis at viral entry. Furthermore, we showed {{that as much as}} 52 % of total pre-S 1 in the HDV envelope could bear infectivity-deficient lesions without affecting entry, indicating that a small number of pre-S 1 polypeptides—estimated at three to four per virion—is sufficient for infectivity. We next investigated the AGL activity in the small or large <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> background (S- and L-AGL, respectively) and found that lesions in S-AGL were more deleterious to infectivity than in L-AGL, a difference that reflects the relative stoichiometry of the small and large <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> in the viral envelope. Finally, we showed that C 147 S, an AGL infectivity-deficient substitution, exerted a dominant-negative effect on infectivity, likely reflecting an involvement of C 147 in intermolecular disulfide bonds...|$|R
40|$|As {{one of the}} world's {{most common}} {{infectious}} diseases, hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a serious worldwide public health problem, with HBV-associated liver disease accounting {{for more than half}} a million deaths each year. Although there is an effective prophylactic vaccine currently available to prevent infection, it has a number of characteristics that are suboptimal: multiple doses are needed to induce long-lasting immunity, immunity declines over time, it does not elicit protection in some individuals, and it is not effective therapeutically. We produced a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) -based vaccine vector expressing the HBV <b>middle</b> <b>envelope</b> surface <b>protein</b> (MS) and found that this vector was able to efficiently generate a strong HBs-specific antibody response following a single immunization in mice. A single immunization with the VSV-MS vector also induced robust CD 8 T-cell activation. The CD 8 T-cell response was greater in magnitude and broader in specificity than the response generated by a vaccinia virus-based vaccine vector or by recombinant protein immunization. Furthermore, a single VSV-MS immunization provided protection against virus challenge in mice.

HDV released into the media was assayed for HDV RNA and HBV <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> and characterized by rate-zonal sedimentation, immunoaffinity purification, electron microscopy, {{and the ability to}} infect primary human hepatocytes. Among the novel findings were that (i) immunostaining for delta antigen 6 days after infection with 300 genome equivalents (GE) per cell showed only 1 % of cells as infected, but this was increased to 16 % when 5 % polyethylene glycol was present during infection; (ii) uninfected cells did not differ from infected cells in terms of albumin accumulation or the presence of E-cadherin at cell junctions; and (iii) sensitive quantitative real-time PCR assays detected HDV replication even when the multiplicity of infection was 0. 2 GE/cell.

40|$|The {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) is a 42 nm {{viral particle}} and {{belongs to a}} family of closely related DNA viruses called the hepadnaviruses. All the hepadnaviruses have similar hepatotropism and life cycles in their hosts. It is an enveloped small circular, partially double stranded DNA virus. The viral genome has a length of approximately 3200 base pairs that encodes four open reading frames (ORF). These are the pre-Surface (pre-S) and Surface (S) gene, the pre-Core (pre-C) and Core (C) gene, the X-gene and the Polymerase (P) -gene. The pre-S and pre-C genes are upstream regions of the S and C genes.

Infection of some cells may involve antidengue antibody-mediated immune adherence to cells bearing immunoglobulin Fc receptors; however, this mechanism does not explain primary infection or the infection of cells without Fc receptors. We hypothesized that dengue virus <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> mediates initial binding to target cells. To test this hypothesis, a recombinant chimeric form of dengue type 2 virus <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> was used as a probe to investigate binding to the surfaces of potential target cells. <b>Envelope</b> <b>protein</b> was expressed amino terminal to the heavy-chain constant region of human immunoglobulin G containing the Fc receptor binding motif; the binding mediated by envelope determinants was distinguishable from the binding mediated by immunoglobulin Fc determinants.

The highest level of binding was to Vero cells; binding was dose and time dependent and saturable. Examination of partial-length recombinant <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> indicated that the binding motif was expressed between amino acids 281 and 423. Recombinant <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> inhibited infection of Vero cells by dengue virus, indicating the functional significance of the interaction of <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> and target cells in infectivity. These results suggest that <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> binding to a non-Fc receptor could explain the cell and tissue tropism of primary dengue virus infection...|$|R
40|$|The cytoplasmic {{tail of the}} {{immature}} Moloney {{murine leukemia}} virus (MoMuLV) <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> is approximately 32 amino acids long. During viral maturation, the viral protease cleaves this tail to release a 16 -amino-acid R peptide, thereby rendering the <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> fusion competent. A series of truncations, deletions, and amino acid substitutions were constructed in this cytoplasmic tail to examine its role in fusion and viral transduction. Sequential truncation of the cytoplasmic tail revealed that removal of as few as 11 amino acids resulted in significant fusion when the <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> was expressed in NIH 3 T 3 cells, similar to that seen following expression of an R-less envelope (truncation of 16 amino acids). Further truncation of the cytoplasmic tail beyond the R-peptide cleavage site toward the membrane-spanning region had no additional effect {{on the level of}} fusion observed. In contrast, some deletions and nonconservative amino acid substitutions in the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic tail (residues L 602 to F 605) reduced the amount of fusion observed in XC cell cocultivation assays, suggesting that this region influences the fusogenicity of full-length <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> Expression of the mutant <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> in a retroviral vector system revealed that decreased envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion correlated with a decrease in infectivity of the resulting virions. Additionally, some mutant <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> which were capable of mediating cell-cell fusion were not efficiently incorporated into retroviral particles, resulting in defective virions. The cytoplasmic tail of MoMuLV <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> therefore influences both the fusogenicity of the <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> and its incorporation into virions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInbred mice expressing {{endogenous}} mouse mammary {{tumor virus}} <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> can be infected with exogenous virus, and the mammary tumors that develop in these mice usually have many proviruses integrated in their genomes, indicating that this virus {{is not subject}} to receptor interference. We show here that transgenic mice expressing an exogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (C 3 H) <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> can still be infected with this virus. Moreover, cultured mammary gland cells expressing the mouse mammary tumor virus (C 3 H) <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> can be superinfected with pseudotyped viruses bearing that same protein. Thus cellular expression of the mouse mammary tumor virus <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> does not block superinfection in vivo or in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Current {{models of}} {{retroviral}} entry hypothesize that {{interactions between the}} viral <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> and the host receptor(s) induce conformational changes in the <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> that activate the <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> and initiate fusion. We employed a liposome-binding assay to demonstrate directly and characterize the activation of a model retroviral <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> (EnvA) from Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). In the presence of purified viral receptor, the trimeric ectodomain of EnvA was converted from a water-soluble form to a membrane-associated form, consistent with conversion of the <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> to its fusogenic state. This activation was nonlinear with respect to receptor concentration, suggesting cooperativity within the trimeric <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> The activated EnvA was stably associated with the target membrane through hydrophobic interactions, behaving like an intrinsic membrane protein. The ability of EnvA to associate with membrane was coincident {{with a loss of}} receptor-binding activity, suggesting that during viral entry activated EnvA dissociates from the receptor to facilitate membrane fusion. These results provide direct evidence that receptor binding triggers conversion of the EnvA protein to a membrane-binding form, illustrating that RSV is a useful model for the study of retroviral entry and activation of pH-independent fusion proteins...|$|R
40|$|Covalently closed {{circular}} DNA (cccDNA), {{the nuclear}} form of hepatitis B virus (HBV), is synthesized by repair of the relaxed circular (RC) DNA genome. Initially, cccDNA {{is derived from}} RC DNA from the infecting virion, but additional copies of cccDNA are derived from newly synthesized RC DNA molecules in a process termed intracellular amplification. It {{has been shown that}} the large viral <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> limits the intracellular amplification of cccDNA for duck hepatitis B virus. The role of the <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> in regulating the amplification of cccDNA in HBV is not well characterized. The present report demonstrates regulation of synthesis of cccDNA by the <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> of HBV. Ablation of expression of the <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> led to an increase (> 6 -fold) in the level of cccDNA. Subsequent restoration of <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> expression led to a decrease (> 50 %) in the level of cccDNA, which inversely correlated with the level of the <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins.</b> We found that the expression of L protein alone or in combination with M and/or S proteins led to a decrease in cccDNA levels, indicating that L contributes to the regulation of cccDNA. Coexpression of L and M led to greater regulation than either L alone or L and S. Coexpression of all three <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> was also found to limit completion of plus-strand DNA synthesis, and the degree of this effect correlated with the level of the proteins and virion secretion...|$|R
40|$|Current {{models of}} {{retroviral}} entry hypothesize that {{interactions between the}} host cell receptor(s) and viral <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> induce structural changes in the <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> that convert it to an active conformation, allowing it to mediate fusion with the membrane. Recent evidence supporting this hypothesis is the demonstration that Tva, the receptor for subgroup A avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV-A), induces conformational changes in the viral <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> These changes include conversion of the <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> to an active, membrane-binding state likely representing a fusogenic conformation. To determine whether binding of the soluble Tva (sTva) receptor was sufficient to activate fully the fusogenic potential of the ASLV-A <b>envelope</b> <b>protein,</b> we have evaluated the ability of ASLV-A to infect receptor-deficient cell lines {{in the presence of}} sTva. Soluble receptor efficiently mediated infection of cells devoid of endogenous Tva in a dose-dependent manner, and this infection was dependent absolutely on the addition of sTva. The infectivity of the virus was enhanced dramatically {{in the presence of the}} polycationic polymer Polybrene or when centrifugal forces were applied during inoculation, resulting in viral titers comparable to those achieved on cells expressing endogenous receptor. sTva functioned to mediate infection at low concentrations, approaching the estimated binding constant of the receptor and viral <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> These results demonstrate that receptor binding can activate the ASLV-A <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> and convert it to a fusogenic conformation competent to mediate the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes...|$|R

We show that transcytosis of primary HIV isolates is blocked by dimeric IgA or IgM against HIV <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins.</b> Neutralization occurs intracellularly within the apical recycling endosome, and immune complexes are specifically recycled to the mucosal surface. One epitope involved in neutralization is a conserved {{sequence of the}} gp 41 HIV <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> subunit. Finally, transcytosis also occurs across functional human mucosal tissue in a process inhibited by a serosal internalization of IgM against the HIV <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> These results suggest that induction of mucosal immunity to HIV <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> may impair the transcytotic route of HIV mucosal transmission...|$|R
40|$|The genomic RNA {{encoding}} {{the structural}} proteins of louping ill, a tickborne flavivirus, was cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparisons of louping ill <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> showed greater homology with tick-borne than mosquito-borne flaviviruses and greater homology {{with the western}} than the far eastern subtype of tick-borne encephalitis virus. Louping ill and tick-borne encephalitis viruses are probably varieties of a common tick-borne ancestral virus. The average amino acid sequence diversity between members of the tick-borne serogroup was significantly {{lower than that of}} mosquito-borne serogroups, suggesting that tick-borne flaviviruses have been subjected to different evolutionary immune selection pressure from the mosquito-borne viruses. Using the published model of tick-borne encephalitis <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> and the derived sequence data on louping ill virus, three discontinuous peptides (amino acids 81 - 88, 207 - 212 and 230 - 234) which may represent critical molecular determinants within the receptor binding site of tick-borne flaviviruses, were identified. These peptides may provide a specific genetic marker for these viruses. Recombinant baculoviruses and vaccinia viruses containing cloned DNA, encoding either the <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> or the structural proteins of louping ill virus, were constructed. Glycosylated <b>envelope</b> <b>protein,</b> presented both inside and on the surface of insect and mammalian cells, was expressed by all four recombinant viruses. Differences in antigenic presentation of <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> were observed between <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> and structural protein constructs as well as between insect cell and mammalian cell expression systems. Despite the expression of epitopes known to elicit neutralizing and protective antibodies when present in authentic antigen, the recombinant <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> expressed by either baculovirus or vaccinia virus failed to induce, under the experimental conditions employed, either neutralizing or protective antibodies in both mice and rabbits against louping ill virus. Hence, louping ill <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> expressed by baculoviruses and vaccinia viruses was antigenically reactive but immunogenically inert. </p...|$|R
