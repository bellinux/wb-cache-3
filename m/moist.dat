5|$|The Western Ghats {{are home}} to four {{tropical}} and subtropical <b>moist</b> broadleaf forest ecoregions – the North Western Ghats <b>moist</b> deciduous forests, North Western Ghats montane rain forests, South Western Ghats <b>moist</b> deciduous forests, and South Western Ghats montane rain forests. The northern portion of the range is generally drier than the southern portion, and at lower elevations makes up the North Western Ghats <b>moist</b> deciduous forests ecoregion, with mostly deciduous forests made up predominantly of teak. Above 1,000 meters elevation are the cooler and wetter North Western Ghats montane rain forests, whose evergreen forests are characterised by trees of family Lauraceae.|$|E
5|$|The most ideal {{food was}} that which most closely matched the humour of human beings, i.e. {{moderately}} warm and <b>moist.</b> Food should preferably also be finely chopped, ground, pounded and strained {{to achieve a}} true mixture of all the ingredients. White wine {{was believed to be}} cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar. Milk was moderately warm and <b>moist,</b> but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ. Egg yolks were considered to be warm and <b>moist</b> while the whites were cold and <b>moist.</b> Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine. Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare, there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef.|$|E
5|$|A {{desert is}} not the kind of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins <b>moist</b> and for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating <b>moist</b> habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental evaluation of moisture transfer {{of a novel}} membrane which is used in enthalpy heat exchanger. The <b>moister</b> transfer through a membrane was investigated in a model of counter flow heat exchanger {{and the effectiveness of}} <b>moister</b> transfer was evaluated for various flow velocities. It was found that the measuring error, i. e. difference between <b>moister</b> absorbed and released is quite high. Therefore, measuring uncertainty analyses were performed. The resulting uncertainty of effectiveness of <b>moister</b> transfer was derived using partial derivatives of all influencing quantities and considering both random and systematic uncertainties. It was found that measuring of mass flow rate has the biggest influence on resulting uncertainty of <b>moister</b> transfer effectiveness. Therefore, accuracy of measured air flow rates measuring must be improved to reach lower resulting uncertainty...|$|R

5|$|Mecopterans mostly inhabit <b>moist</b> environments {{although}} a few species are found in semi-desert habitats. Scorpionflies, family Panorpidae, generally live in broad-leaf woodlands with plentiful damp leaf litter. Snow scorpionflies, family Boreidae, appear in winter and are to be seen on snowfields and on moss; the larvae being able to jump like fleas. Hangingflies, family Bittacidae, occur in forests, grassland and caves with high moisture levels.

5|$|Sundews {{generally}} grow in seasonally <b>moist</b> or {{more rarely}} constantly wet habitats with acidic soils {{and high levels}} of sunlight. Common habitats include bogs, fens, swamps, marshes, the tepuis of Venezuela, the wallums of coastal Australia, the fynbos of South Africa, and <b>moist</b> streambanks. Many species grow in association with sphagnum moss, which absorbs much of the soil's nutrient supply and also acidifies the soil, making nutrients less available to plant life. This allows sundews, which do not rely on soil-bound nutrients, to flourish where more dominating vegetation would usually outcompete them.|$|E

40|$|When we solute {{the issue}} of {{moisture}} transfer {{it is necessary to}} deal with two mechanisms: molecular mass transfer and the convective mass transfer. The driving force of transmission is the difference of the concentrations of moisture, respectively the difference of the partial vapor pressures. For the convective mass transfer is the key value the convective <b>moister</b> coefficient, which depends on many parameters, but for one particular experimental design will be influenced mainly by velocity. Experimentally detectable is the total moisture transfer caused by both mechanisms, it is the overall moisture transfer coefficient. In previous work we tried from a set of measured data during various modes and for different samples evaluate the dependence of the convection <b>moister</b> coefficient on the flow velocity for the concrete arrangement of the experiment. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare these values of the convection <b>moister</b> coefficient with the values calculated from criterial equations using the analogy of heat and mass transfer...|$|R
