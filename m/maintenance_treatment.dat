25|$|On {{the basis}} of the successes of the pilot, the {{programme}} began scale-up in 2004 and plans are in place to open an additional 1500 methadone <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatment</b> clinics for about 300,000 heroin users by 2008. A National Training Center for methadone <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatment</b> has been established in Yunnan to provide clinical and technical support. The services offered at such clinics have been broadened and provide access to other services, including HIV and hepatitis testing, antiretroviral therapy for eligible AIDS patients, group activities, and skills training for employment. The use of methadone maintenance therapy has been incorporated into the AIDS Regulations as a treatment for heroin addiction. Additionally, the requirements for entrance into methadone <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatment</b> programmes have been relaxed to encourage greater access. For example, patients are no longer required to have local residency or a previous history of internment in a detoxification centre. The programme is not without problems, however, and retaining drug users in the programme remains a critical challenge.|$|E
40|$|Managing a {{pavement}} {{network has}} become more complex as the competition for pavement preservation funds has grown {{and the need to}} justify decisions has increased. As a result, tools that can help an agency collect, analyze, and summarize data have become increasingly important. As a result, asset management tools, such as pavement management systems, have become a necessary component of today’s transportation agencies. Coupled with a change in agency focus from expansion to preservation, pavement management systems are now being used to support the use of cost-effective preservation strategies such as preventive maintenance. However, the use of pavement management tools to support preventive maintenance programs is impacted by the degree to which preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments</b> are integrated into a pavement management system. Agencies that have successfully integrated their preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments</b> into their pavement management system have been able to demonstrate the benefits of their preventive maintenance programs to upper management. For the most part, these analyses have focused on the comparison of worst-first strategies to strategies that incorporate preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments</b> or illustrations of the cost-effectiveness of preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments...</b>|$|R

40|$|Preventive {{maintenance}} {{strategies are}} applied to pavement {{to bring it back}} to appropriate serviceability when it starts to deteriorate soon after construction due to several factors, e. g., traffic loading, deterioration of pavement materials, and climatic effects. In recent years, more and more highway agencies are adopting preventive maintenance strategies and moving away from rehabilitation actions since rehabilitating pavements at near failure is not a cost-effective pavement management technique. A variety of preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments</b> or thin surface treatments are available to bring pavements back to appropriate serviceability for road users. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) has adopted several preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments</b> including thin overlay, ultra-thin bonded asphalt surface (Nova Chip), chip seal, and slurry seal. This thesis discusses the effectiveness of thin surface or preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments</b> applied in 2007 on 16 highway sections in Kansas. Three types of thin surface treatments, 25 -mm Hot-Mix-Asphalt (1 ” HMA) overlay, ultra-thin bonded asphalt surface (Nova Chip), and chip seal, were examined in this study. These treatments were applied on three types of surface preparation, namely, bare surface, 25 -mm surface recycle (1 ” SR), and 50 -mm surfac...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundRecent {{trials have}} {{suggested}} that <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments</b> improve outcomes for patients not progressing after first-line therapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, physicians have little guidance on selecting which patients benefit the most and what drug or regimen is optimal. Here, we report a systematic review and network meta-analysis of <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments</b> in subgroups determined by performance status (PS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, histology and response to induction. MethodsPubMed and conference proceedings were reviewed and individual study relative efficacy measures were meta-analysed in a Bayesian hierarchical model. The primary outcome, overall survival (OS), was evaluated in terms of (i) posterior surface under cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), (ii) probability of being best treatment, (iii) probability of outperforming no maintenance, and (iv) posterior median hazard ratio (95 % credible interval). Secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and adverse events. FindingsTwelve trials evaluating eight <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments</b> in 3850 patients were meta-analysed. Selected <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments</b> showed clinically meaningful benefits of ⩾ 20 % reduction in hazards of death with ⩾ 90 % probability of outperforming no maintenance in terms of OS: (i) switch to or continue pemetrexed (nonsquamous), continue gemcitabine, or switch to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for PS 0 patients, (ii) switch to pemetrexed (nonsquamous) for PS 1 patients, (iii) switch to EGFR TKI for EGFR mutation positive patients, (iv) switch to or continue pemetrexed or switch to EGFR TKI for nonsquamous patients, (v) continue gemcitabine for squamous patients, (vi) switch to docetaxel or continue gemcitabine for responders to induction, or (vii) switch to or continue pemetrexed (nonsquamous) or switch to EGFR TKI for patients with stable disease post-induction. InterpretationMaintenance treatments show clinically meaningful survival benefits in good performance status patients with advanced NSCLC not progressing after first-line chemotherapy. Benefits are optimised by targeting specific maintenance to individual patients guided by PS, EGFR mutation status, histology and response to induction...|$|R
40|$|In psychiatry, one of {{the main}} factors {{contributing}} to poor response to pharmacological treatment is adherence. Noncompliance with <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments</b> for chronic illnesses such as schizophrenia and affective disorders can exceed 50 %, Poor adherence can be due to drug-related factors (tolerance, complexity of prescription, side effects, or cost), patient-related variables (illness symptoms, comorbidity, insight capacity, belief system, or sociocultural environment), and physician-related factors (communication or psychoeducational style). Psychosocial treatments must be used in conjunction with medication during the maintenance phase to improve adherence to treatment and to achieve - through the management of psychological variables - better social, work, and family functioning. This article reviews the concepts of adherence and noncompliance, and their impact on <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments,</b> as well as the effect of dealing with psychosocial factors in psychiatric treatment...|$|R
25|$|China {{has made}} {{impressive}} {{progress in the}} development and implementation of effective intervention strategies, especially since 2004. The country is currently in a transition stage in its HIV policy development.

25|$|In general, most oncologists rely on {{combinations}} of drugs for the initial, induction phase of chemotherapy. Such combination chemotherapy usually offers {{the benefits of}} early remission and a lower risk of disease resistance. Consolidation and maintenance treatments are intended to prevent disease recurrence. Consolidation treatment often entails a repetition of induction chemotherapy or the intensification chemotherapy with additional drugs. By contrast, <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatment</b> involves drug doses that are lower than those administered during the induction phase.|$|E
25|$|A {{large body}} of {{international}} research has shown the efficacy of methadone <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatment</b> programmes {{for the treatment of}} drug addiction and subsequent reduction in HIV risk behaviors. In acknowledgment of this evidence, in 2004 the Chinese government called for the use of such practices to mitigate HIV transmission. Immediately, under the governance of the Ministries of Health and Public Security and the State Food and Drug Administration, a pilot study of eight clinics in five provinces was done. Inclusion in the programme required: (1) several failed attempts to quit the use of heroin, (2) at least two terms in a detoxification centre, (3) age at least 20 years, (4) being a registered local resident of the area in which the clinic is located, and (5) being of good civil character. Those testing HIV positive need only fulfill criteria 4 and 5. To monitor the progress of the clinics, a database was established to gather data on demographics, medical issues, drug use, and other information about the patients. These data were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months, and indicated reductions in heroin use, drug-related crime, and unemployment in those who received methadone <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatment.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Maintenance</b> <b>treatments</b> for asphalt {{concrete}} generally include thin asphalt overlays, crack sealing, surface rejuvenating, fog sealing, micro milling or diamond grinding and surface treatments.

40|$|In recent years, {{the major}} efforts of highway {{agencies}} have shifted from constructing new facilities to preserving and maintaining existing systems. Maintenance responsibility lies {{with state and}} local agencies, {{and there is no}} federal fund for maintenance. Thus, it is extremely important that the use of available maintenance funds is optimized. A study of the effect of various <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments</b> of flexible pavement condition is presented in this paper. Pavement roughness was used as direct quantitative measures of pavement condition. A database, extracted from Indiana Department of Transportation records, was used in the analysis. Possible factors that may affect pavement condition were investigated. Maintenance-effect models were developed to examine the effect of various <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments</b> on pavement roughness. In addition, a maintenance-effectiveness measure was introduced to compare various treatments. Analyses were conducted for two highway classes and for two climatic regions...|$|R
25|$|PET imaging {{studies have}} {{suggested}} low doses are preferable. Clinical response was associated with at least 65% occupancy of D2 receptors, while greater than 72% was likely to cause hyperprolactinaemia and over 78% associated with extrapyramidal side effects. Doses of haloperidol greater than 5nbsp&mg increased the risk of side effects without improving efficacy. Patients responded with doses under even 2nbsp&mg in first-episode psychosis. For <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatment</b> of schizophrenia, an international consensus conference recommended a reduction dosage by about 20% every 6 months until a minimal maintenance dose is established.|$|E
25|$|Lamotrigine is {{approved}} in the US for <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatment</b> of bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder. While the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate are predominantly antimanics, lamotrigine {{is most effective}} for preventing the recurrent depressive episodes of bipolar disorder. The drug seems ineffective {{in the treatment of}} current rapid-cycling, acute mania, or acute depression in bipolar disorder; however, it is effective at prevention of or delaying of manic, depressive, or rapid cycling episodes. According to studies in 2007, lamotrigine may treat bipolar depression without triggering mania, hypomania, mixed states, or rapid-cycling.|$|E
25|$|Lamotrigine, {{originally}} {{marketed as}} Lamictal and available under many brands worldwide, is an anticonvulsant drug {{used in the}} treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. For epilepsy, it is used to treat focal seizures, primary and secondary tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Like the anticonvulsant medications carbamazepine and valproate, lamotrigine also seems to act as an effective mood stabilizer, and was the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for this purpose since lithium, a drug approved almost 30 years earlier. It is approved for the <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatment</b> of bipolar type II.|$|E

25|$|Virtually all roads {{require some}} form of {{maintenance}} before {{they come to the}} end of their service life. Pro-active agencies use pavement management techniques to continually monitor road conditions and schedule preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatments</b> as needed to prolong the lifespan of their roads. Technically advanced agencies monitor the road network surface condition with sophisticated equipment such as laser/inertial Profilometers. These measurements include road curvature, cross slope, asperity, roughness, rutting and texture. This data is fed into a pavement management system, which recommends the best <b>maintenance</b> or construction <b>treatment</b> to correct the damage that has occurred.|$|R
25|$|The three cysteinyl leukotrienes, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, are potent bronchoconstrictors, increasers of {{vascular}} permeability in postcapillary venules, and stimulators of mucus secretion {{that are}} {{released from the}} lung tissue of asthmatic subjects exposed to specific allergens. They play a pathophysiological role in diverse types of immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Drugs that block their activation of the CYSLTR1 receptor viz., montelukast, zafirlukast, and pranlukast, are used clinically as <b>maintenance</b> <b>treatment</b> for allergen-induced asthma and rhinitis; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced asthma and rhinitis (see Aspirin-induced asthma); exercise- and cold-air induced asthma (see Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction); and childhood sleep apnea due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy (see Acquired non-inflammatory myopathy#Diet and Trauma Induced Myopathy).
