This article describes a selec-tion procedure of desert sites in North Africa and Saudi Arabia, of size 1 O 0 x 1 O 0 km z, using a criterion of spatial uniformity in a series of Meteosat- 4 visible data. Twenty such sites are selected with a spatial uniformity better than 3 % <b>in</b> <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> <b>in</b> a multitemporal series of cloud-free images. These sites are among the driest sites in the world. Their meteorological properties are here described in terms of cloud cover with ISCCP data and precipitation using data from a network of meteorological stations. Most of the selected sites are large sand seas, the geomorphology of which can be characterized with Spot data. The temporal stability of the spatially averaged reflectance of each selected site is investigated at seasonal and hourly time scales with multitemporal series of Meteo-sat- 4 data. It is found that the temporal variations, of typical peak-to-peak amplitude 8 - 15 % <b>in</b> <b>relative</b> <b>value,</b> are mostly controlled by directional effects. Once the directional effects are removed, the residual rms varia-tions, representative of random temporal variability, are on the order of 1 - 2 % <b>in</b> <b>relative</b> <b>value.</b> The suitability of use of these selected sites in routine operational calibra-tion procedures is briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|Diversification {{return is}} an {{incremental}} return earned by a rebalanced portfolio of assets. The diversification {{return of a}} rebalanced portfolio is often incorrectly ascribed {{to a reduction in}} variance. We argue that the underlying source of the diversification return is the rebalancing, which forces the investor to sell assets that have appreciated <b>in</b> <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> and buy assets that have declined <b>in</b> <b>relative</b> <b>value,</b> as measured by their weights in the portfolio. In contrast, the incremental return of a buy-and-hold portfolio is driven {{by the fact that the}} assets that perform the best become a greater fraction of the portfolio. We use these results to resolve two puzzles associated with the Gorton and Rouwenhorst index of commodity futures, and thereby obtain a clear understanding of the source of the return of that index. Diversification return can be a significant source of return for any rebalanced portfolio of volatile assets. ...|$|R

40|$|Using {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} and (18 -F) -fluorodeoxyglucose, we studied cerebral glucose metabolism in 10 anorectic girls within their underweight state and after weight gain. Ten age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were used as controls. Both groups were scanned during rest, eyes closed and with low ambient noise. In absolute values, the underweight anorectic patients, when compared to control subjects, showed a global (p = 0. 002) and regional (p < or = 0. 001) hypometabolism of glucose which normalized with weight gain. <b>In</b> <b>relative</b> <b>values,</b> no global difference could be assessed between underweight anorectic patients and controls but a trend can, nevertheless, be observed toward parietal and superior frontal cortex hypometabolism associated with a <b>relative</b> hypermetabolism <b>in</b> the caudate nuclei and in the inferior frontal cortex. After weight gain, all regions normalized for absolute and <b>relative</b> <b>values,</b> although a trend appears toward relative parietal hypometabolism and inferior frontal cortex hypermetabolism in weight gain anorectic patients. Absolute brain glucose hypometabolism might result from neuroendocrinological or morphological aspects of anorexia nervosa or might be the expression of altered neurotransmission following deficient nutritional state. As some differences exists <b>in</b> <b>relative</b> <b>values</b> <b>in</b> underweight patients and tend to persist in weight gain states, this could support a potential abnormal cerebral functioning, a different reaction to starvation within several regions of the brain or different restoration rates according to the region.

50|$|Formally, {{convergence}} trades {{refer to}} trading in similar {{assets in the}} expectation that they will converge in value. Arbitrage is a stricter notion, referring to trading in identical assets or cash flows, while <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> is a looser notion, referring to using valuation methods (value investing) to take long-short positions in similar assets without necessarily assuming convergence, and is more associated with equities. For example, <b>in</b> <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> investing one may believe that the stock of one mining company is undervalued relative to some valuation, while another stock is overvalued (relative to this or another valuation), and thus one will expect the undervalued stock to outperform the overvalued stock, even if these are quite different companies.|$|R

50|$|Pairs trading or pair {{trading is}} a long-short, ideally market-neutral {{strategy}} enabling traders to profit from transient discrepancies <b>in</b> <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> of close substitutes. Unlike {{in the case of}} classic arbitrage, in case of pairs trading, the law of one price cannot guarantee convergence of prices. This is especially true when the strategy is applied to individual stocks - these imperfect substitutes can in fact diverge indefinitely. In theory the long-short nature of the strategy should make it work regardless of the stock market direction. In practice, execution risk, persistent and large divergences, as well as a decline in volatility can make this strategy unprofitable {{for long periods of time}} (e.g. 2004-7). It belongs to wider categories of statistical arbitrage, convergence trading, and <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> strategies.|$|R
