5000|$|The rules package changed {{again in}} 2000, with [...] "Spec" [...] (design specifications) rear wings being made legal {{for the first}} time, and new {{manufacturers}} being added to the eligibility list (exotics such as the Panoz Esperante, Qvale Mangusta and Jaguar XKR), along with their fuel injected / <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Early <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engines</b> in T-head {{configuration}} {{were the}} 1917 Stutz straight-4 and 1919 Pierce-Arrow straight-6 engines. The standard flathead engines {{of that day}} were not very efficient and designers tried to improve engine performance by using multiple valves. The Stutz Motor Company used a modified T-head with 16 valves, twin-spark ignition and aluminium pistons to produce 80 bhp (59 kW) at 2400 rpm from a 360.8 cid (5.8-liter) straight-4 (0.22 bhp per cubic inch). Over 2300 of these powerful early <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engines</b> were built. Stutz not only used them in their famous Bearcat sportscar but in their standard touring cars as well. In 1919 Pierce-Arrow introduced its 524.8 cid (8.6-liter) straight-6 with 24 valves. The engine produced 48.6 bhp (0.09 bhp per cubic inch) and ran very quietly, which was an asset to the bootleggers of that era.|$|R
50|$|The car {{was brought}} back after World War I with a <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engine</b> to bring fame to the marque at Brescia. The {{production}} Brescia tourer also brought in much-needed cash.|$|E
5000|$|Under the bonnet is Volkswagen’s 1.6-litre <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engine</b> that {{delivers}} [...] of power at 5500 rpm and peak torque of 140 Nm at 3250 rpm. Transmission is a five-speed manual.|$|E
50|$|In {{automotive}} engineering a multi-valve or multivalve {{engine is}} one where each cylinder has more than two valves. A <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engine</b> has better breathing and {{may be able to}} operate at higher revolutions per minute (RPM) than a two-valve engine, delivering more power.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, however, {{it had become}} clear that the Sierra {{had fallen out of}} step technologically against modern Japanese rivals which offered <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engines</b> and {{multi-link}} rear suspension. All of these features appeared on the Sierra's replacement, the front-wheel-drive Mondeo, which was unveiled at the end of 1992 and launched the following March.|$|R
50|$|In 1931 the Stutz Motor Company {{introduced}} a 322 cid (5.3-liter) dual camshaft 32-valve straight-8 with 156 bhp (116 kW) at 3900 rpm, called DV-32. The engine offered 0.48 bhp per cubic inch. About 100 of these <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engines</b> were built. Stutz also used {{them in their}} top-of-the-line sportscar, the DV-32 Super Bearcat that could reach 100 mph (160 km/h).|$|R
5000|$|An {{example of}} modern <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engines</b> for small boats is the Volvo Penta IPS Series.

Propshaft power ranges from [...] (highest efficiency 59.7 kW/liter for IPS400 3.7-liter straight-4 diesel). Multiple units can be combined.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 Chevron began {{developing}} a new road/race version of the Cypher. The Cypher has a carbon fibre-kevlar composite chassis and a fuel-injected lightweight 4.4 litre V8 <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engine.</b> It is offered in two forms: a touring version for road, and a race version with a turbocharged fuel-injected engine, space-frame chassis, and unitary body.|$|E
50|$|To {{achieve their}} goals, the rules {{targeted}} {{the type of}} car most manufacturers produced, a mid-range 4-door family saloon with a 2-litre normally aspirated <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engine</b> having a minimum production run of 2500 in one year. To enable the cars to be easily recognised on the track, the rules dictated that the car's body shape had to remain {{the same as the}} production model, but most other areas of the car could be modified specifically for racing.|$|E
5000|$|Amédée Varlet was the company's design-engineer, with {{a number}} of {{innovative}} inventions to his credit, generated between 1905 and 1914, which Delahaye patented. These included the twin-cam <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engine,</b> and the V6 configuration. Varlet continued in this role until he eventually took over the Drawing Office, at 76 years of age, when much younger Jean François was hired in 1932 as chief design-engineer. In 1932, Varlet was instructed by Weiffenbach, under direction from majority shareholder Madame Desmarais, Leon Desmarais' widow, to set up the company's Racing Department, assisted by Jean François. Those who knew him well at the factory affectionately referred to Charles Weiffenbach as [...] "Monsieur Charles".|$|E
50|$|<b>Multi-valve</b> <b>engines</b> {{continued}} to be popular in racing and sports engines. Robert M. Roof, the chief engineer for Laurel Motors, designed his multi-valve Roof Racing Overheads early in the 20th century. Type A 16-valve heads were successful in the teens, Type B was offered in 1918 and Type C 16-valve in 1923. Frank Lockhart drove a Type C overhead cam car to victory in Indiana in 1926.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of the use of this engine, the Dolomite Sprint has been claimed to be [...] "the world's first mass-produced {{multi-valve}} car". While other <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engines</b> (notably the Lotus 907) were produced in volume, they were not used in mass production vehicles until after the introduction of the Dolomite Sprint. The design of the cylinder head won a British Design Council award in 1974.|$|R
50|$|Turbocharging and {{supercharging}} are {{technologies that}} also improve engine breathing, {{and can be}} used instead of, or in conjunction with, <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engines.</b> The same applies to variable valve timing and variable intake manifolds. Rotary valves also offer improved engine breathing and high rev performance but these were never very successful. Cylinder head porting, as part of engine tuning, is also used to improve engine performance.|$|R
50|$|The 1.6-liter (1,587 cc) 4A-GE Toyota {{engine was}} one of the {{earliest}} straight-4 engines to have both a DOHC 16-valve configuration (four valves per cylinder, two intake, two exhaust) and electronic fuel injection (EFI). The cylinder head was developed by Yamaha Motor Corporation and was built at Toyota's Shimayama plant. While originally conceived of as a two-valve design, in 1984 Toyota and Yamaha changed the 4A-GE to a four-valve after a year of evaluation. It produced 115-140 bhp/86-104 kW@6,600 rpm (54.2-65.5 kW/liter) and 148 Nm/109 lbft@5,800 rpm. To compensate for the reduced air speed of a <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engine</b> at low rpm, the first-generation engines included the T-VIS feature.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, Renault {{launched}} the sports {{version of the}} Renault 19, replacing the Renault 9 Turbo and Renault 11 Turbo. Renault abandons its legendary 1.4 Cléon-Fonte turbo carburetor {{in favor of a}} <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engine</b> and multipoint injection, it will be an evolution of the engine of 1721 cm³ F2N, the race remains the same, but the bore is increased, giving a displacement of 1764 cm³, topped by a 16-valve cylinder head that will equip the R19 16S. This engine F7P 140 bhp also equip the Clio 16S in February 1991, replacing the Super 5 GT Turbo. In July 1992, the Clio 16S and 16S R19 are fitted as standard with a catalytic converter, in order to comply with pollution standards applicable to 1 January 1993, which makes them lose 3 c.|$|E
5000|$|A {{hemispherical}} {{cylinder head}} ("hemi-head") gives an efficient combustion chamber with an excellent surface-to-volume ratio, with minimal heat {{loss to the}} head, and allows for two large valves. However, a hemi-head allows {{no more than two}} valves per cylinder, and these large valves are necessarily heavier than in a <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engine.</b> The intake and exhaust valves lie {{on opposite sides of the}} chamber and necessitate a [...] "cross-flow" [...] head design. Since the combustion chamber is a partial hemisphere, a flat-topped piston would yield too low a compression ratio unless a very long stroke is used, so to attain desired compression ratio the piston crown is domed to protrude into the head at top dead center, resulting in a combustion chamber in the shape of the thick peel of half an orange.|$|E
5000|$|Ford Motor Company {{used the}} Zetec {{name on a}} variety of Inline-4-cylinder {{automobile}} engines. It was coined to replace [...] "Zeta" [...] on a range of 1.6 L to 2.0 L <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engines</b> introduced in 1991 because Ford was threatened with legal action by Lancia who owned the Zeta trademark. The company used the name widely in European advertising and later introduced it to the North American market with the Contour.|$|R
25|$|Within a few years, {{a dizzying}} {{assortment}} of technologies {{were being used}} by hundreds of producers all over the western world. Steam, electricity, and petrol/gasoline-powered automobiles competed for decades, with petrol/gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. Dual- and even quad-engine cars were designed, and engine displacement ranged {{to more than a}} dozen litres. Many modern advances, including gas/electric hybrids, <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engines,</b> overhead camshafts, and four-wheel drive, were attempted, and discarded at this time.|$|R
50|$|Although all {{manufacturers}} {{were familiar}} with <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engines</b> and hemispherical combustion chambers, adding more valves per cylinder, or designing the complex valve train needed for a hemispherical chamber were expensive ways of improving the high-RPM breathing of production vehicles. By canting {{the angle of the}} NASCAR-mandated two valves per cylinder, significantly larger valves could be used. The Chrysler hemi had an oversquare 4.25 in bore and 3.75 in stroke as did the wedge-chambered big-block Chrysler RB.|$|R
5000|$|Various engines {{were tried}} {{out in the}} {{prototype}} stage including Vauxhall, Ford and BMW units. The Vauxhall 2.3 L engine met United States emission requirements but {{did not meet the}} power target of [...] A German Ford V6 was considered but industrial action crippled supply. BMW could not supply an engine in the volumes needed. Colin Chapman of Lotus offered, and Jensen accepted, his company's new 1973 cc Lotus 907 dual overhead cam, 16-valve all-alloy engine. This <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engine</b> is the first modern dual overhead cam 4 valve per cylinder engine to be mass-produced on an assembly line. This setup puts out approximately 144 bhp (107 kW), topping out at 119 mph (192 km/h) and accelerating from zero to 60 mph in 7.8 seconds (8.1 seconds for the emission controlled U.S. version).|$|E
5000|$|A {{hemispherical}} head ("hemi-head") gives an efficient combustion chamber with minimal heat {{loss to the}} head, and allows for two large valves. However, a hemi-head usually allows {{no more than two}} valves per cylinder due to the difficulty in arranging the valve gear for four valves at diverging angles, and these large valves are necessarily heavier than those in a <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engine</b> of similar valve area, as well as generally requiring more valve lift. The intake and exhaust valves lie {{on opposite sides of the}} chamber and necessitate a [...] "cross-flow" [...] head design. Since the combustion chamber is virtually a hemisphere, a flat-topped piston would yield too low a compression ratio unless a very long stroke is used, so to attain desired compression ratio the piston crown is domed to protrude into the head at top dead centre, resulting in a combustion chamber in the shape of the thick peel of half an orange.|$|E
5000|$|Production of the 740 ceased on October 2, 1992, {{though the}} engine, transmission, chassis, and other details {{continued}} in the Volvo 940 (see below), which was essentially identical to the 740 {{with the exception of}} the rear of the sedans. For 1985, an intercooled version of the 2-litre turbo engine (B200ET) was introduced for markets such as Italy, where larger engines were heavily taxed. This unit produces [...] at 5500 rpm, ten horsepower more than the preceding non-intercooled B19ET variant, enough for a claimed 200 km/h top speed. For 1989, a 16-valve version of the larger B230 engine was introduced (B234), with nearly as much peak power as the turbo version. This was Volvo's first <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engine.</b> In 1990, the 740 received a minor facelift with new, smaller, composite headlamps and 780-style tail lights. In 1991, both the 740 and the newly introduced 940 received an updated dashboard, similar in appearance to the ones found in the 760. The 740 remained mostly unchanged for the 1992 model year, and sales ended in 1993 in favour of the Volvo 940.|$|E

50|$|In <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engines,</b> the {{conventional}} two-valves-per-cylinder setup is complemented by {{a minimum of}} an extra intake valve (three-valve cylinder head) or, more commonly, with an extra intake and an extra exhaust valve (four-valve cylinder head), the latter meaning higher RPM are, theoretically, achievable. Five valve designs (with three inlet and two exhaust valves) are also in use. More valves per cylinder means improved gas flow and smaller reciprocating masses may be achieved, leading to improved engine efficiency and, ultimately, higher power output and better fuel economy.|$|R
50|$|A <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engine</b> design {{typically}} has three, four, or five valves per cylinder {{to achieve}} improved performance. Any four-stroke {{internal combustion engine}} needs at least two valves per cylinder: one for intake of air and fuel, and another for exhaust of combustion gases. Adding more valves increases valve area and improves the flow of intake and exhaust gases, thereby enhancing combustion, volumetric efficiency, and power output. Multi-valve geometry allows the spark plug to be ideally located within the combustion chamber for optimal flame propagation. Multi-valve engines tend to have smaller valves that have lower reciprocating mass, which can reduce wear on each cam lobe, and allow more power from higher RPM without the danger of valve bounce. Some engines are designed to open each intake valve at a slightly different time, which increases turbulence, improving the mixing of air and fuel at low engine speeds. More valves also provide additional cooling to the cylinder head. The disadvantages of multi-valve engines are an increase in manufacturing cost and a potential increase in oil consumption due to the greater number of valve stem seals. Some SOHC multi-valve engines (such as the Mazda B8-ME) use a single fork-shaped rocker arm to drive two valves (generally the exhaust valves) so that fewer cam lobes will be {{needed in order to}} reduce manufacturing costs.|$|E
40|$|In {{automobile}} engineering terminology a <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engine</b> is {{one where}} each cylinder has more than two valves. A multivalve engine has better breathing and can operate at higher revolutions per minute (rpm) than a two valve engine, delivering more power. Nowadays Eicher Motor is generating only two valve engines. But the need of the hour is to develop more efficient, four valve engines, which provide better fuel efficiency. Eicher Motor has started working on four valve engines because two valve engines apart from delivering inferior fuel efficiency compared to four valve engines also fall short {{on the front of}} emission norms compliance. To keep the transition two valve to four valve economical, it was proposed that instead of having an entirely new set up for assembling the four valve engines, two valve engine assembly line be use after required modification. For this change were made to engine assembly common line (Block), and cylinder head assembly line conveyors, location of cylinder head assembly line, manpower, machine and tools etc. of Eicher Motor as per the requirement of four valve and two valve assembly line and also engine assembly process was changed...|$|E
50|$|Although most <b>multi-valve</b> <b>engines</b> have {{overhead}} camshafts, either SOHC or DOHC, a multivalve engine {{may be a}} pushrod {{overhead valve}} engine (OHV) design. Chevrolet has revealed a three-valve version of its Generation IV V8 which uses pushrods to actuate forked rockers, and Cummins makes a four-valve OHV straight six diesel, the Cummins B Series (now known as ISB). Ford also uses pushrods in its 6.7L Power Stroke engine using four pushrods, four rockers and four valves per cylinder. The Harley-Davidson Milwaukee Eight engine, introduced in 2016, uses four-valves per cylinder driven by pushrods and a single in-block camshaft.|$|R
