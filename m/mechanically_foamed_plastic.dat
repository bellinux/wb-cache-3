40|$|Plastics {{are used}} {{extensively}} as manufacturing mate-rials throughout the world. In particular, <b>foamed</b> <b>plastics</b> products, with high cell density and uniform cell sizes, offer superior mechanical properties (e. g., toughness[1] and fatigue life[2]) and improved thermal insulation[3] {{in comparison with}} solid plastics products. Applications of <b>foamed</b> <b>plastics</b> range from household commodities such as packaging and insulation materials, to advanced engineering products such as airplane and automotive parts with high strength-to-weight ratio. Additionally, <b>foamed</b> <b>plastic</b> products reduce material usage, which typically accounts for 50 to 70 % of total production cost.

40|$|Three heat {{resistant}} cross-linked PVC <b>foam</b> <b>plastics</b> were prepared and their performances {{were compared with}} universal cross-linked PVC structural foam. The results show that these three {{heat resistant}} foams have higher glass transition temperatures (close to 100 &# 176;C) than universal structural foam (83. 2 &# 176;C). Compared with the universal structural foam, the three heat resistant foams show much higher decomposition temperature and better chemical stability due to the crosslinking of PVC macromolecular chains. The heat distortion temperature (HDT) values of the three heat resistant <b>foam</b> <b>plastics</b> are just a little {{higher than that of}} universal structural foam.

40|$|As per our proposal, we have {{examined}} the Code Change Resolution submitted by the Safer Insulation Solution (Ref. 1) and the accompanied paper by V. Babrauskas (Ref. 2). In summary, the referenced documents claim the following: 1) Fire safety will not be decreased by waiving the fire performance of <b>foam</b> <b>plastic</b> insulation in IRC 316. 3 in lieu of placing a protective thermal barrier in front of non-FR treated foams for wall and ceiling constructions or where the foam insulation lies on the exterior and below grade of buildings. 2) The ASTM E 84 test method does not represent full scale test results for <b>foam</b> <b>plastic</b> insulations. 3) Halogenated FR treated <b>foam</b> <b>plastic</b> insulations are a health hazard that poses a threat greater than the fire hazard of non-FR treated foams when protected as defined above. With full respect for Dr. Babrauskas as a fire scientist, we disagree with these claims as described below. On item 1, Ref. 2, it is stated that: Current codes require <b>foam</b> <b>plastic</b> insulation materials to have both protection by a thermal barrier and compliance with Steiner Tunnel test requirements [ [...] . ] Insulations protected by a thermal barrier are fire safe {{and the use of}} flame retardants does not provide any additional benefit [ [...] . ] Changing the buildin...|$|R

At the same time, in order to check its seismic-isolation property, the high-performance foam concrete as filling materials of Galongla tunnel in Tibet was simulated by FEM. The simulated results show that the polystyrene <b>plastic</b> <b>foam</b> can remarkably decrease the stress and the plastic zone in final lining, so it can effectively reduce the seismic damage of the tunnel.

40|$|The work {{covers the}} high-porous silicon and {{titanium}} carbides manufactured on {{base of the}} syntactic <b>foam</b> <b>plastics.</b> The aim is to study the mechanism of forming carbides in the matrix of the syntactic <b>foam</b> <b>plastic</b> for development of the technology of high-porous non-metallic materials. The regularities of the phase formation and also the change of the structure and micromorphology of the condensated phase on the carbonization and carbidization stages of the syntactic <b>foam</b> <b>plastic</b> with introduced silicon and titanium oxides have been studied and explained by a complex of the physical-chemical methods from positions of the atomic-molecular conceptions. The proposed technology permits to obtain the wide spectrum of the materials with high thermo-mechanical properties. The reduction of the silicon oxide in the nitrogen atmosphere permits to improve the physical-chemical properties of the finished product, to manufacture the high-pure silicon carbide, to decrease sufficiently the silicon losses and electric power consumption varying the simple technological parameters to influence on the phase composition of the finished pproduct.
