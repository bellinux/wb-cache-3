50|$|Bistatic range {{refers to}} the basic <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> made by a radar or sonar system with {{separated}} transmitter and receiver. The receiver measures the time difference of arrival of the signal from the transmitter directly, and via reflection from the target. This defines an ellipse of constant bistatic range, called an iso-range contour, on which the target lies, with foci centred on the transmitter and receiver. If the target is at range Rrx from the receiver and range Rtx from the transmitter, and the receiver and transmitter are a distance L apart, then the bistatic range is Rrx+Rtx-L. Motion of the target causes a rate of change of bistatic range, which results in bistatic Doppler shift.|$|E

40|$|Question: What is the inter-rater {{reliability}} for <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> passive physiological or accessory movements in upper extremity joints? Design: Systematic review {{of studies of}} inter-rater reliability. Participants: Individuals with and without upper extremity disorders.

Results: Twenty-one studies were included of which 11 demonstrated acceptable inter-rater reliability. Two studies satisfied all criteria for internal validity while reporting almost perfect reliability. Overall, the methodological quality of studies was poor. ICC ranged from 0. 26 (95 % Cl - 0. 01 to 0. 69) for measuring the physiological <b>range</b> <b>of</b> shoulder internal rotation using vision to 0. 99 (95 % Cl 0. 98 to 1. 0) for the physiological <b>range</b> <b>of</b> finger and thumb flexion/extension using a goniometer. <b>Measurements</b> <b>of</b> physiological <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion using instruments were more reliable than using vision. <b>Measurements</b> <b>of</b> physiological <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion were also more reliable than <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> end-feel or <b>of</b> accessory <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion.
