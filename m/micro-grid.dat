40|$|<b>Micro-grids</b> offer a new {{challenging}} domain {{for power}} electronics, since {{they include a}} variety of power sources and electronic power processors (EPP) interacting each other. In <b>micro-grids,</b> energy efficiency requires smart control of power flow, and power quality calls for voltage support by reactive power regulation, suppression of voltage distortion at load terminals and limitation of current harmonics at utility interface.

In the recent past years, the micro grids that are driven through PV systems evolved considerably [3].

Despite significant cost reductions in solar panels, these options can still be cost-prohibitive mainly due over-sizing of generation assets corresponding {{with a lack of}} ability to actively manage electricity demand. The main contribution shared is the methodology and optimization approach of least-cost combinations of generation asset sizes, in solar panels and batteries, subject to meeting reliability constraints; these results are based on a techno-economic modeling approach constructed for assessing decentralized <b>micro-grids</b> with demand-side management capabilities. The software model constructed is implemented to represent the technical characteristics of a low-voltage, direct current network architecture and computational capabilities of a power management device. The main use-case of the model presented is based on serving representative, aggregated, household-level load profiles combined with simulated power output from solar photovoltaic modules and the kinetic operating constraints of lead-acid batteries at hourly timesteps over year-long simulations. The state-space for solutions is based on available solar module and battery capacities from distributors in Jharkhand, India. Additional work presented also extends to real-time operation of such isolated <b>micro-grids</b> with requisite local computation. First, for load disaggregation and forecasting purposes, clustering algorithms and statistical learning techniques are applied on quantitative results from inferred load profiles based on data logged from off-grid solar home systems. Second, results from an optimization approach to accurately parametrize a lead-acid battery model for potential usage in real-time field implementation are also shared. Economic results, sensitivity analyses around key technical and financial input assumptions, and comparisons in cost reductions due to the optimization of solar and battery assets for decentralized <b>micro-grids</b> with demand-side management capabilities are subsequently presented.
