5|$|The Peshwa's {{territory}} {{was in an}} {{area called}} the Desha, {{now part of the}} <b>modern</b> <b>state</b> of Maharashtra. The region consists of the valleys of the Krishna and Godavari rivers and the plateaus of the Sahyadri Mountains. Shinde's territory around Gwalior and Bundelkhand was a region of rolling hills and fertile valleys that slopes down toward the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the north. The Pindari territory was the valleys and forests of the Chambal, the north western region of the <b>modern</b> <b>state</b> of Madhya Pradesh. It was a mountainous region with a harsh climate. The Pindaris also operated from Malwa, a plateau region in the north west of the state of Madhya Pradesh, north of the Vindhya Range. Holkar was based in the upper Narmada River valley.|$|E
5|$|Numerous other {{battles that}} {{occurred}} in the <b>modern</b> <b>state</b> of Indiana include the Siege of Fort Wayne, the Pigeon Roost Massacre and the Battle of the Mississinewa. Most of the Native Americans remained passive throughout the war, but there were many incidents between settlers and the tribes, leading to the deaths of hundreds in the territory. The Treaty of Ghent, signed in 1814, ended the War and relieved American settlers from their fears of the nearby British and their Indian allies.|$|E

5|$|Plymouth Colony (sometimes New Plymouth) was an English colonial {{venture in}} North America from 1620 to 1691. The first {{settlement}} of the Plymouth Colony was at New Plymouth, a location previously surveyed and named by Captain John Smith.

At its height, Plymouth Colony occupied most of the southeastern portion of the <b>modern</b> <b>state</b> of Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|A {{handful of}} {{rooms in the}} <b>modern</b> <b>State</b> Apartments reflect either 18th-century or Victorian Gothic design. The State Dining Room, for example, whose current design {{originates}} from the 1850s but which was badly damaged during the 1992 fire, is restored to its appearance in the 1920s, before the removal {{of some of the}} gilded features on the pilasters. Anthony Salvin's Grand Staircase is also of mid-Victorian design in the Gothic style, rising to a double-height hall lit by an older 18th-century Gothic vaulted lantern tower called the Grand Vestibule, designed by James Wyatt and executed by Francis Bernasconi. The staircase has been criticised by historian John Robinson as being a distinctly inferior design to the earlier staircases built on the same site by both Wyatt and May.|$|E
5|$|All {{of modern}} NY446 was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} Route4, a cross-state unsigned legislative route defined by the New York State Legislature in 1908. Route4 continued south from Hinsdale on what is now NY16 and east {{from the village of}} Cuba on County Route20. The legislative route system was replaced by the <b>modern</b> <b>state</b> route system in 1924, at which time most of Route4 was designated NY17, including from Hinsdale to Cuba. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY17 was moved onto a more southerly alignment (now NY417) between Olean and Wellsville. Its former routing between Hinsdale and the Amity hamlet of Belvidere became the southwesternmost part of the new NY63, which continued north from Belvidere to the Lake Ontario shoreline.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Sanh's {{activities}} in the 1910s, there were {{two members of the}} Nguyễn Dynasty who commanded respect among Vietnamese monarchists. The first was the boy emperor Duy Tân, who was himself deported in 1916 after staging an uprising. Duy Tan's grandfather, Emperor Dục Đức, was the adopted son of the childless Emperor Tự Đức, the last independent emperor of Vietnam. The second figure who was seen by Vietnamese as a possible leader of an independent monarchy was Prince Cường Để. Cường Để was a direct descendant of Emperor Gia Long, who had established the Nguyễn Dynasty and unified Vietnam in its <b>modern</b> <b>state.</b> Cường Để was a prominent anti-colonial activist who lived in exile in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Discussed in ArticleVIII, the {{judiciary}} {{was separated from}} the two other branches of the government, and was to be served by elective judges. Courts of first instance existed in each voivodeship and were in constant session, with judges elected by the regional sejmik assemblies. Appellate tribunals were established for the provinces, based on the reformed Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal. The Sejm elected from its deputies the judges for the Sejm court, a precursor to the <b>modern</b> <b>State</b> Tribunal of Poland. Referendary courts were established in each province to hear the cases of the peasantry. Municipal courts, described in the law on towns, complemented this system.|$|E
5|$|Modern-day Nigeria {{has been}} the site of {{numerous}} kingdoms and tribal states over the millennia. The <b>modern</b> <b>state</b> originated from British colonial rule beginning in the 19th century and the merging of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate in 1914. The British set up administrative and legal structures whilst practising indirect rule through traditional chiefdoms. Nigeria became a formally independent federation in 1960. It experienced a civil war from 1967 to 1970. It then alternated between democratically elected civilian governments and military dictatorships until it achieved a stable democracy in 1999, with the 2011 presidential elections considered {{the first to be}} reasonably free and fair.|$|E

5|$|Sierra Highway or El Camino Sierra is a road in Southern California, United States.

Two portions of this road are currently signed as Sierra Highway. The first is an old alignment of SR14/U.S. Route 6 from Los Angeles to Mojave. This road is also signed with the unusual designation of State Route14U through the city of Santa Clarita. The second part signed as Sierra Highway is a portion of US395 in Bishop.|$|E

5|$|Since the country's {{reconstitution}} and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, Robert Mugabe's {{administration has}} pulled down many monuments and plaques making {{reference to the}} dead of the First and Second World Wars, perceiving them as reminders of white minority rule and colonialism that go against what the <b>modern</b> <b>state</b> stands for. This view is partly rooted in the association of these memorials with those commemorating the British South Africa Company's dead of the Matabele Wars, {{as well as those}} memorialising Rhodesian servicemen killed during the Bush War. Many Zimbabweans see their nation's involvement in the World Wars as a consequence of colonial rule that {{had more to do with}} the white community than the black majority. Southern Rhodesia's dead of the two World Wars today have no official commemoration, either in Zimbabwe or overseas.|$|E
5|$|The Alamanni, {{who were}} {{originally}} from the Main valley of central Germany, had colonised the Agri Decumates (roughly the <b>modern</b> <b>state</b> of Baden-Württemberg in SW Germany) when {{the region was}} evacuated by the Romans in the mid-3rd century after belonging to the Roman province of Germania Superior for over 150 years. The Alamanni established {{a series of small}} pagi ("cantons"), mostly strung along the East bank of the Rhine (although a few were in the hinterland). The exact number and extent of these pagi is unclear and probably changed over time. Pagi, usually pairs of pagi combined, formed kingdoms (regna) which, it is generally believed, were permanent and hereditary.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss Confederation in Huldrych Zwingli's time {{consisted}} of thirteen states (cantons) {{as well as}} affiliated areas and common lordships. Unlike the <b>modern</b> <b>state</b> of Switzerland, which operates under a federal government, each of the thirteen cantons was nearly independent, conducting its own domestic and foreign affairs. Each canton formed its own alliances within and without the Confederation. This relative independence served {{as the basis for}} conflict {{during the time of the}} Reformation when the various cantons divided between different confessional camps. Military ambitions gained an additional impetus with the competition to acquire new territory and resources, as seen for example in the Old Zurich War of 1440–1446.|$|E

5|$|The {{route of}} PA848 {{began as an}} {{alignment}} of the Cochecton and Great Bend Turnpike (a portion of the Great Bend and Newburgh Turnpike), a19th Century turnpike built from Great Bend, Pennsylvania to Newburgh, New York. The road was completed in Pennsylvania in1811, five years after construction began. The turnpike did not fare after the mid-1800s, with the road abandoned in 1853. When the <b>modern</b> <b>state</b> highway system for Pennsylvania debuted in1928, the alignment of future PA371 was not included. In1936, PA371 was designated on its alignment from New Milford to the New York state line; however, this would only last sixteen years, as the Pennsylvania Department of Highways truncated PA371 back to the intersection with PA171 in Union Dale, further east in Susquehanna County.|$|E
5|$|The {{war between}} Tecumseh and Harrison {{merged with the}} War of 1812 when the {{remnants}} of the Indian Confederation allied with the British in Canada. The Siege of Fort Harrison is considered to be the United States' first land victory during the war. Other battles that occurred in the <b>modern</b> <b>state</b> of Indiana include the Siege of Fort Wayne, the Pigeon Roost Massacre and the Battle of the Mississinewa. The Treaty of Ghent, signed in 1814, ended the war and relieved American settlers from their fears of the nearby British and their Indian allies. This marked the end of hostilities with the Native Americans in Indiana. Of the 58 recorded incidents between Native Americans and the United States in Indiana during the 19thcentury, 43 were Indian victories.|$|E
5|$|A broad swathe {{of western}} Chiapas {{was held by}} the Zoques, {{covering}} the Depresión Central, the middle Grijalva basin, the Chimalapas {{and parts of the}} Pacific coastline. The main Zoque settlements in the Depresión Central were Copainalá, Mezcalapa, Quechula and Tecapatán. Their settlements on the western side of the Grijalva River included Citalapa, Jiquipilas, Ocozocuautla and the Corzos valley. Coyatocmó was a small Zoque settlement that grew into the <b>modern</b> <b>state</b> capital, Tuxtla Gutiérrez. The Aztecs exacted tribute from the Zoques, and dominated trade routes running through their territory. In pre-Columbian times, the Depresión Central featured two of the largest cities in the region, Chiapa and Copanaguastla. The area around Chiapa de Corzo was occupied by the Chiapanecas, whose ethnicity and language are unknown. The Chiapanecas were militarily powerful before the Spanish conquest; they had forced a number of important Zoque settlements to pay them tribute, and had successfully resisted being incorporated into the Aztec Empire. The Chiapaneca territory lay between the territories of the Zoques and the Tzotzil Maya, in the upper and middle Grijalva basin; their main settlements were Acala, Chiapa, Ostuta, Pochutla and Suchiapa.|$|E
