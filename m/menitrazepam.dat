50|$|<b>Menitrazepam</b> {{is a drug}} {{which is}} a {{benzodiazepine}} derivative. It is similar in structure to tetrazepam and nimetazepam, with the 7-chloro group of tetrazepam replaced by nitro. It is a hypnotic agent used {{in the treatment of}} insomnia, and therefore has strong sedative, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and anxiolytic actions like those of other hypnotic benzodiazepines. <b>Menitrazepam</b> is a good oral hypnotic agent, however, delay in the time for peak plasma levels to reach their maximum brings into question the benefit of <b>menitrazepam</b> for the treatment of insomnia when compared to other hypnotics. Typically, the sleep inducing properties of hypnotics occur within 0.5 hours. In some cases, as with temazepam and nitrazepam, strong hypnotic effects can be felt 15 to 20 minutes after oral ingestion.|$|E
