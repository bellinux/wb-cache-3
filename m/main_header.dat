During the warm-up, six helium leaks were declared on the cryogenic distribution line (QRL). All the leaks were detected on the <b>main</b> <b>header</b> supplying supercritical helium at 4. 5  K during normal LHC operation. Following a complex investigation based on combination of time-of-flight leak detection over 400 -m long vacuum sub-sectors and X-rays, the leaks have been localized on the compensation bellows required for longitudinal thermal contraction. During the investigation, some compensation bellows were found damaged but not leaky yet, amounting to  16 the total number of bellows to be repaired. This paper will present the investigation method for the localization of damaged bellows, the failure mechanism and the applied improvements in the bellows design. The QRL repair procedures and the final leak-tightness validation campaign will be also described...|$|E
40|$|High {{acoustic}} energy {{is known to}} cause vibrations in pipes, and in some severe cases acoustic induced vibration can lead to fatigue failure at branch connections with high stress concentration. Industry guidelines suggest using mitigation measures such as fabricated full wrap-around reinforcement pad (re-pad) or Sweepolet fittings at branch connections. Effectiveness of these mitigation measures is evaluated via a finite element analysis of four types of branch connections; (i) Sockolet, (ii) Sockolet with 2 ” wide partial re-pad, (iii) Sockolet with full wrap-around re-pad, and (iv) Sweepolet. Four distinct acoustic frequency ranges (1 / 3 octave bands) with associated sound pressure levels are used as the excitation source. Maximum stress levels in the <b>main</b> <b>header</b> pipe at the branch tie-in are monitored to assess the potential for vibration damage. Of the four branch connections, Sockolet with full wrap-around re-pad {{is found to be}} least susceptible to damage, followed by the Sweepolet.

Simulation {{results are presented}} to demonstrate life extension of a typical power plant while satisfying the performance specifications. Key Words-Power-station control: feedforward control: robust control. Abatraet-The objective of life-extending control is to achieve a trade-off between structural durabiilty and dynamic performance. This paper focuses on structural durability of the <b>main</b> steam <b>header</b> under load following to illustrate how the life-extending control of fossil fuel power plants can be achieved via feedforward/feedback. This concept is poten-tially applicable to both new and aging power plants {{under a variety of}} operational modes such as hot start-up, scheduled shutdown, and load following where the plant power is rapidly maneuvered to meet the varying load demand. The feedforward control policy is synthesized via nonlinear optimization of a multi-objective cost functional of dynamic performance and service life under the constraints of actuator saturation, operational limitations, and allowable structural damage, including thermomechanical fatigue and plastic deformation. A linear robust feedback control law that is superimposed on the feedforward sequence is synthesized based on induced &-norm techniques. The results of simulation experiments are presented to demonstr-ate that the proposed feedforward/feedback control policy is potentially capable of ramping the plant power up at a rate of 10 % of the full load per minute while maintaining the specified performance and satisfying the damage constraints...|$|R
