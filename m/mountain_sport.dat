Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine what type of sport activities influence better sport tourists’ spending in Montenegro.

The Park has great potential to harmonize the needs of different users. The article is based on empirical research and a review of relevant literature. The empirical research was conducted on a sample of 124 respondentsin order to show the potential for the development of <b>mountain,</b> <b>sport,</b> educational and recreational tourism. The research includes interviews with climbers – presidents of mountaineering organizations in Bitola and the management team of Pelister. Through the research we value the elements referring to attracting visitors to sports and recreation, as well as the elements of influence and management of natural resources in the PelisterNational Park. The results showed that National Parkis mostly practiced for mountaineering and climbing. From sports activitiesthe ones that dominated are skiing, Nordic running and cycling. Also the Park is a place for education and place with potential of developing health tourism. ...|$|E

This paper develops an alternative spatial model, based upon the construction of orthopedic hospital service areas (HSA O s), and introduces indices {{for the analysis of}} patient streams in order to identify areas, irrespective of canton, with diverse characteristics, importance, needs, or demands. Methods HSA O s were constructed using orthopedic discharge data. Patient streams between the HSA O s were analysed by calculating three indices: the localization index (% local residents discharged locally), the netindex (the ratio of discharges of nonlocal incoming residents to outgoing local residents), and the market share index (% of local resident discharges of all discharges in local hospitals). Results The 85 orthopedic HSA O s show a median localization index of 60. 8 %, a market share index of 75. 1 %, and 30 % of HSA O s have a positive netindex.

40|$|The tourism {{industry}} {{is one of}} the fastest growing business sectors in the world. Over recent years, mountain tourism has become a more and more important part of this growth. This PhD thesis focuses on the alpine skiing industry, which {{is one of the}} categories of <b>mountain</b> <b>sport</b> tourism with the strongest financial influence in the mountain regions. Alpine skiing is an extremely competitive industry that has experienced stagnation trend in recent years. Therefore, it is important to examine factors that may have positive effects on the performance of ski resorts. Innovation is fundamental in order to realize the potential of the alpine skiing sector and to ensure sustainable business growth. For many ski resorts, innovation is a necessary condition for survival in a fiercely competitive environment. In other words, the competitiveness of ski resorts depends on their ability to innovate. The overall purpose of this PhD thesis is twofold. First, the thesis aims to increase knowledge about factors that affect alpine skiing demand and the price for alpine ski passes. Second, it aims to provide new knowledge about how the alpine skiing industry can use innovative pricing approaches to achieve competitive advantage. This is one of the first studies to contribute to the research-based knowledge on innovative pricing approaches in the alpine skiing industry. In general, the demand for alpine skiing exhibits strong variation. Hence, during periods with low demand, there is unused capacity. This thesis argues that one way to exploit unused capacity in the low-demand periods is to use innovative pricing strategies. Specifically, the findings of the appended research articles suggest that ski resorts can increase profitability and deal with fluctuations in demand by implementing the following pricing approaches: (1) variable pricing based on seasonality and (2) a dynamic pricing approach based on different weather scenarios. In addition, this thesis provides empirical evidence on the price–quality relationship at ski resorts and discusses practical implications for ski resorts’ managers. Possible directions for future research on innovative pricing approaches in the alpine skiing industry are also included for interested readers...|$|E
