5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of <b>Militia</b> colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of the <b>Militia</b> representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete <b>Militia</b> battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the <b>Militia</b> join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; this, too, was rejected. As both possible approaches {{for dealing with the}} <b>Militia</b> had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken to do away with it entirely {{and replace it with a}} newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements of the <b>Militia</b> willing to be transferred.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it allowed}} the <b>militia</b> men to draw Native American blood in revenge, {{the result of}} the battle was {{inconclusive}} with respect to its original purpose of stopping the Native American raids in the area. The men of the <b>militia</b> returned triumphantly to Galena, Illinois bearing the scalps of two Sauk warriors they had slain. The battle helped raise public opinion towards the <b>militia.</b> After the disastrous defeat at Stillman's Run in May, the battle at Yellow Creek coupled with the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, helped to demonstrate that the <b>militia</b> could stand up to and defeat Black Hawk's warriors.|$|E
5|$|Details of Bonnet's {{military}} service are unclear, {{but he held}} the rank of major in the Barbados <b>militia.</b> The rank was probably due to his land holdings, since deterring slave revolts was an important function of the <b>militia.</b> Bonnet's <b>militia</b> service coincided with the War of the Spanish Succession, {{but there is no}} record that he took part in the fighting.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{examples}} on the Mexican view on <b>militias</b> are the Chiapas conflict {{against the}} EZLN {{and against the}} EPR in Guerrero, where the government forces combated the upraised <b>militias.</b> And in a more recent case when civilian self-defence <b>militias</b> appeared during the Mexican war on drugs, the government regulated them and transformed the <b>militias</b> in to Rural federal forces, and those who resisted were combated and imprisoned.|$|R
50|$|Tuareg <b>militias</b> of Ghat are ethnic Tuareg tribal <b>militias,</b> {{operating}} in South-West Libya desert areas during the Second Libyan Civil War. The <b>militias</b> rose to {{prominence in the}} district of Ghat, which has a Tuareg majority. Gradually, the Tuareg forces expanded their hold also into neighbouring districts. The Libyan Tuaregs are supported by Tuaregs of Mali and groups like Ahmed al-Ansari, with support from the Misratan Libyan Dawn forces. Tuareg <b>militias</b> often utilize the Berber flag. Tuareg <b>militias</b> are sometimes identified as one of the main five forces in the Libyan Civil War.|$|R

5|$|During the night, {{three of}} the militia's horses wandered off; the next day, June 25, three men {{went in search of}} the animals while the rest stayed behind. At the cabin, seven Native American braves {{appeared}} in the distance. The troops immediately began pursuing the natives, who fled into the woods, instead of reporting the sighting to Dement. The Native American warriors, as had been done other times {{during the course of the}} war, set an ambush for the <b>militia</b> men in the forest. The <b>militia</b> pursued the natives into the woods and, as they entered the forest, the natives opened fire, the volley instantly killed two <b>militia</b> men and wounded another. The <b>militia</b> retreated and formed a battle line but the native forces would not relent. The rest of Dement's company attempted to rescue the outmatched <b>militia</b> men but were unable to beat back the native warriors. Black Hawk's band attacked the <b>militia</b> men, again forcing the beleaguered force to fall back to the Kellogg cabin and barn.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, U.S. diplomats {{spoke with}} the TFG's Ambassador to Ethiopia. Among the topics of {{conversation}} were Somali security forces, and Ambassador Abdulkarim Farah said that the TFG had trained nearly 7,000 <b>militia</b> in Baledogle who were now patrolling throughout Somalia, from Kismayo to Puntland. Another 3,500 <b>militia</b> were undergoing training. Farah said that on May 18 he planned to his hometown of Beledweyne to establish a <b>militia</b> training camp there, at the instruction of President Yusuf. Farah estimated that approximately 60 per cent of the <b>militia</b> were Darod, 30 per cent were Hawiye, and the remaining 10 per cent were from other clans; the majority of security forces in Mogadishu were Darod. He said that the TFG had not sought to exclude Darod from the <b>militia,</b> and attributed the imbalance to Hawiye having primarily supported the Council of Islamic Courts (CIC).|$|E
5|$|Later in the war, the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act 1943 {{was passed}} {{to change the}} law to allow the {{transfer}} of <b>Militia</b> units to the AIF if 65 percent or more of their personnel had volunteered for overseas service. Additionally, changes to the Act meant that <b>Militia</b> units were able to serve anywhere south of the Equator in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), excluding western Java and northern Borneo, {{and as a result of}} this, <b>Militia</b> units saw action against Japanese forces in the Dutch East Indies, at Merauke, later in the war. Despite this, the AIF remained the Australian Army's main combat force during the war and indeed more than 200,000 members of the <b>Militia</b> transferred to the AIF throughout the course of the conflict. Nevertheless, 32 <b>Militia</b> infantry battalions, later organised into three <b>Militia</b> divisions (3rd, 5th and 11th), saw service over much of the South West Pacific and participated in the following campaigns: Salamaua-Lae, Huon Peninsula, Finisterre Range, New Britain and Bougainville.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>militias</b> include guerrillas, Islamists, and <b>militias</b> {{who fought}} against Gaddafi {{but refused to}} lay down their arms when the war ended in October 2011. According to some {{civilian}} leaders, these latter <b>militias</b> shifted from merely delaying the surrender of their weapons to actively asserting a continuing political role as [...] "guardians of the revolution". Some of the largest, and most well-equipped <b>militias</b> are associated with Islamist groups now forming political parties. Before the official end of hostilities between loyalist and opposition forces, there were reports of sporadic clashes between rival <b>militias,</b> and vigilante revenge killings.|$|R
50|$|The Battle of Aden was {{a battle}} for the control of Aden, Yemen, between the Houthis and Yemen Army units and <b>militias</b> loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh on one side, and local residents, Southern Movement <b>militias,</b> and Yemen Army units and <b>militias</b> loyal to Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi on the other side.|$|R

5|$|The Frontier <b>Militia</b> {{represents}} the military {{arm of the}} Frontier systems' territorial defense pact. The <b>Militia</b> is a loosely governed mishmash of homesteaders, bandits, mercenaries, and pirates, all rising up as 'citizen soldiers' when the need arises. Each brigade within the <b>Militia</b> is responsible for fighting in an assigned section of Frontier territory. Although some brigades {{are little more than}} vast pirate organizations, the <b>Militia</b> has enough resources to be a real obstacle to the IMC's ambitions on the Frontier. The <b>Militia</b> often claims that direct action against the IMC {{is in the best interest}} of the homesteaders whom they allegedly represent, but not everyone on the Frontier sees it that way.|$|E
5|$|When the War Office re-authorized the <b>militia</b> in 1845 the 14th East Essex Regiment of <b>Militia,</b> {{which later}} became the Essex Rifles <b>Militia,</b> was given the old County Gaol as its headquarters.|$|E
5|$|A {{little over}} {{an hour after the}} committee's meeting, Governor Taylor {{declared}} a state of insurrection and called out the state <b>militia.</b> He called the legislature into special session, not in Frankfort, but in heavily Republican London, which he insisted was a safer location. Defiant Democratic legislators refused to heed the call to London, but when they attempted to convene first in the state capitol and later in other public locations in Frankfort, they found the doors barred by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in, and immediately ordered the state <b>militia</b> to stand down. He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort. The Republican <b>militia</b> refused to disband, and a rival Democratic <b>militia</b> formed across the lawn of the state capitol. Civil war seemed possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{task of the}} <b>militias</b> was {{to protect}} against guerrillas {{expected}} to appear after the takeover, against undercover agents sent to Czechoslovakia and {{to cooperate with the}} police and the army. About 3,000 militiamen joined police forces. Non-communists were slowly removed from the <b>militias.</b> The control over the <b>militias</b> went to the Ministry of the Interior.|$|R
50|$|On January 13, 2016, the Asayish {{attacked}} the government-backed Sootoro <b>militia's</b> checkpoints in Qamishli, {{resulting in the}} death of one Sootoro militant, although the <b>militias</b> reconciled on January 18.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Militias</b> {{have so far}} {{refused to}} be {{integrated}} into a central security force. [...] Many of these <b>militias</b> are disciplined, but {{the most powerful of}} them answer only to the executive councils of various Libyan cities. These <b>militias</b> make up the so-called Libyan Shield, a parallel national force, which operates at the request, rather than at the order, of the defence ministry.|$|R
5|$|A month later, Graves {{is leading}} the <b>Militia,</b> and Blisk has been {{promoted}} within the IMC. During a one on one confrontation over radio, Blisk denounces Graves for being a traitor, and vows to continue fighting the <b>Militia.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Stillman's defeat on May 14, {{the regulars}} and <b>militia</b> {{continued}} up the Rock River {{to search for}} Black Hawk. The militiamen became discouraged at {{not being able to}} find the British Band. When they heard about the Indian raids, many deserted so that they could return home to defend their families. As morale plummeted, Governor Reynolds asked his <b>militia</b> officers to vote on whether to continue the campaign. General Whiteside, disgusted with the performance of his men, cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of disbanding. Most of Whiteside's brigade disbanded at Ottawa, Illinois, on May 28. About 300 men, including Abraham Lincoln, agreed to remain in the field for twenty more days until a new <b>militia</b> force could be organized.|$|E
5|$|After {{this initial}} skirmish, Black Hawk led {{many of the}} civilians in his band to the Michigan Territory. On May 19, the <b>militia</b> {{traveled}} up the Rock River trailing and searching for Black Hawk and his band. Several small skirmishes and massacres ensued over the next month in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin before the <b>militia</b> regained public confidence in battles at Bloody Lake and Waddams Grove.|$|E
50|$|<b>Militias</b> {{have played}} an {{important}} role supporting Pakistan's Military since the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 when Pakistan, with the support of <b>militias,</b> was able to gain control of the region which is now known as Azad Kashmir. Pakistan found the <b>militias</b> volunteering to participate in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965 and the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 quite useful as well.|$|R
50|$|On 10 October, violent clashes erupted between Bani Walid <b>militias</b> and Misrata <b>militias</b> in {{the valley}} of Mardum, 10 km east of Bani Walid. One Bani Walid fighter was killed and two others injured, while the overall death toll was put at 10 killed. 5-10 civilians died due to {{shelling}} by the Misrata <b>militias</b> while some supplies were successfully delivered to the city.|$|R
50|$|Similar <b>militias</b> {{existed in}} Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, lands that, like Finland, were under Russian {{sovereignty}} {{until the end}} of World War I. These <b>militias</b> remained in existence until World War II, evolving somewhat into home guard <b>militias.</b> The phenomenon should be distinguished from the Freikorps established in Germany after its defeat in World War I, although some similarities exist.|$|R
5|$|All male Upper Canadians between 18 and 60years of {{age were}} members of the Sedentary <b>Militia,</b> which was called into active duty during the Rebellions of 1837. Macdonald served as a private in the <b>militia,</b> patrolling the area around Kingston, but the town saw no real action and Macdonald was not called upon to fire on the enemy.|$|E
5|$|At the Battle of Millstone, Brigadier General Philemon Dickinson of the New Jersey <b>militia</b> {{scored a}} {{brilliant}} success. On 20 January 1777 near Van Nest's Mill, 400 <b>militia</b> and 50 Pennsylvania riflemen crossed an icy stream and fought a pitched battle with 500 British regulars and three cannons. The British lost 25 casualties, 12 prisoners, 43 wagons, 104 horses, 115 cattle and about 60 sheep. The Americans admitted losses {{of four or}} five men. Afterward, the British refused to believe that they had been beaten by <b>militia.</b> On 23 January two British regiments were waylaid by Brigadier General William Maxwell near Woodbridge. The 200 New Jersey Continentals inflicted losses of seven killed and 12 wounded while only suffering two men wounded.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, {{the core}} of St. Louis {{leadership}} had shifted from the Creole and Irish families to a new group, dominated by anti-slavery Germans. Among this new class of leaders was Frank P. Blair, Jr., who led an {{effort to create a}} local <b>militia</b> loyal to the Union after Missouri Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson hinted about secession. This local <b>militia</b> allied itself with the Union army forces at Jefferson Barracks under the leadership of Nathaniel Lyon, which on May 10, 1861 cleared a Confederate encampment outside the city in {{what became known as the}} Camp Jackson Affair. While the Confederates were being marched back into town, a group of citizens attacked the Union and <b>militia</b> forces, costing 28 civilian lives.|$|E

5|$|Benedict Arnold {{was on his}} way to Philadelphia {{to discuss}} his future when he was alerted that a British force was marching toward a supply depot in Danbury, Connecticut. He {{organized}} the <b>militia</b> response, along with David Wooster and Connecticut <b>militia</b> General Gold S. Silliman. He led a small contingent of <b>militia</b> attempting to stop or slow the British return to the coast in the Battle of Ridgefield, and was again wounded in his left leg.|$|E
5|$|Bormann and Himmler shared {{responsibility}} for the Volkssturm (people's <b>militia),</b> which drafted all remaining able-bodied men aged 16 to 60 into a last-ditch <b>militia</b> founded on 18 October 1944. Poorly equipped and trained, the men were sent to fight on the eastern front, where nearly 175,000 of them were killed without having any discernible impact on the Soviet advance.|$|E
5|$|Boston {{lacked a}} regular supply of fresh meat, and many horses needed hay. On May 21, Gage ordered {{a party to}} go to Grape Island, in the outer harbor, and bring hay to Boston. When the Continentals on the {{mainland}} noticed this, they took alarm, and the <b>militia</b> were called out. As the British party arrived, they came under fire from the <b>militia.</b> The <b>militia</b> set fire to a barn on the island, destroying 80 tons of hay, and prevented the British from taking more than 3 tons.|$|E
50|$|In {{the middle}} of February 1948 the central {{committee}} of the Communist Party decided to form armed units from Communist Party members and supporters. On February 21, 1948 these units were renamed Dělnické milice (Worker's <b>Militias).</b> The <b>militias</b> were hastily equipped and set on alert during the communist takeover of power {{at the end of}} February. The name was soon changed to People's <b>Militias.</b>|$|R
50|$|When the Portuguese {{who were}} the first colonial power to {{dominate}} the island raised local <b>militias</b> {{under the command of}} local leaders known as Mudaliyars. These <b>militias</b> took part in the many Portuguese campaigns against the Lankan Kings. The Dutch continued to employ these <b>militias</b> but due to their unreliability tended to favor employing Swiss and Malay mercenaries in their campaigns in the island.|$|R
5000|$|Across the country, <b>militias</b> began {{surrendering}} to the government. The government formed a [...] "National Mobile Force" [...] {{for the purpose}} of evicting illegal <b>militias.</b> On the same day as the declaration, various <b>militias</b> in Misrata held meetings, ultimately deciding to submit to the government's authority, and handed over various public facilities they had been holding, including the city's three main jails, which were handed over to the authority of the Ministry of Justice. Hours before the announcement, in Derna, the two main <b>militias</b> (one of them Ansar al-Sharia) active in the city both withdrew, leaving both their five military bases behind.|$|R
