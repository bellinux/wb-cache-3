40|$|Analyst {{coverage}} {{has been cited}} increasingly as an important attribute {{in the selection of}} an underwriter for a firm about to go public. However, it has also been alleged that affiliated analysts provide biased research. In this study, we examine these interrelated issues by examining the long-run performance of IPOs with coverage from their managing underwriters in a 1993 - 2003 sample. We find that (1) analysts' research coverage from their <b>managing</b> <b>syndicate</b> is not related to long-run performance; (2) long-run performance is not different for firms that receive all-star analyst coverage; and (3) investors are not systematically worse off for following lead underwriter recommendations. ...|$|E

40|$|Search {{engines are}} {{essential}} {{components of the}} World Wide Web; both commercially {{and in terms of}} everyday usage, their importance is hard to overstate. This thesis examines the question of why there is bias in search engine results – bias that invites users to click on links to large websites, commercial websites, websites based in certain countries, and websites written in certain languages. In this thesis, the historical development of the search engine industry is traced. Search engines first emerged as prototypical technological startups emanating from Silicon Valley, followed by the acquisition of search engine companies by major US media corporations and their development into portals. The subsequent development of pay-per-click advertising is central to the current industry structure, an oligarchy of virtually integrated companies <b>managing</b> networks of <b>syndicated</b> advertising and traffic distribution. The study also shows a global landscape in which search production is concentrated in and caters for large global advertising markets, leaving {{the rest of the world}} with patchy and uneven search results coverage. The analysis of interviews with senior search engine engineers indicates that issues of quality are addressed in terms of customer service and relevance in their discourse, while the analysis of documents, interviews with search marketers, and participant observation within a search engine marketing firm showed that producers and marketers had complex relationships that combine aspects of collaboration, competition, and indifference. The results of the study offer a basis for the synthesis of insights of the political economy of media and communication and the social studies of technology tradition, emphasising the importance of culture in constructing and maintaining both local structures and wider systems. In the case of search engines, the evidence indicates that the culture of the technological entrepreneur is very effective in creating a new megabusiness, but less successful in encouraging a debate on issues of the public good or public responsibility as they relate to the search engine industry...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Several cybercrimes {{occurred}} in Taiwan throughout 2016, {{such as the}} computer hacking of governmental intranet {{that led to the}} theft of confidential information, website attacks by distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS), the crack of the public bicycle-sharing system, and the rampant ransomware. This phenomenon is not endemic in Taiwan but exists in other countries as well, which indicates that cybercrime has becoming a major type of crimes worldwide. Of all cybercrimes, the First Commercial Bank (hereafter referred to as FCB) ATM Heist was thrust into the international spotlight because the suspects were arrested and almost all the stolen cash was recovered. Besides, the malware planted into the ATMs was found in the next day after the crime was committed. Moreover, the modus operandi adopted by the hackers were successfully cracked in an unprecedentedly short period of time. 1. Case Profile On 11 July 2016, the FCB reported the incident of abnormal withdrawal to Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) as follows: more than NT$ 83. 27 million (approximately US$ 2. 63 million) was withdrawn in cash by unknown subjects from 41 ATMs at 22 FCB branches in Taiwan. 1 The evidence collected suggests that this crime was committed by a foreign criminal group consisting of 22 suspects from 8 countries. 2 The criminal syndicate infiltrated FCB’s intranet from one of the bank’s foreign branch and withdrew the money in cash by remotely taking control over its server. On 17 July 2016, 3 bagmen of this criminal syndicate, namely Peregudovs Andrejs (Latvia), Pencov Nicolae (Moldova) and Colibaba Mihail (Romania), were apprehended by the police in Taiwan, and the prosecution authorities also issued a warrant for the arrest of the other 19 suspects. By virtue of multiple sources of information such as the informants’ reports, the suspects’ call detail records, the confessions by the arrested suspects, and the monitor video clips, a total of NT$ 77. 48 million (approximately US$ 2. 44 million) was recovered. On 13 September 2016, the Taipei District Prosecutor’s Office charged the three arrested suspects with offences of fraudulence and money-laundering as well as offences against the computer security under Taiwan’s Criminal Code, requesting the court to sentence each of them to a 12 -year term of imprisonment. 3 The court of first instance finally sentenced each of them to a 5 -year term of imprisonment and a fine of NT$ 600, 000. 2. Crime Reconstruction and the Modus Operandi (a) Crime Reconstruction 4 Since May 2016, the criminal syndicate had gradually taken control over FCB’s ATM network by infiltrating and planting malware into the bank’s intranet and ATMs (Type PC 1500 XE), 5 which allowed the criminal syndicate to change FCB’s financial records and withdraw money from specific ATMs in Taiwan. On 10 and 11 July 2016, Berezovskiy Sergey and the other 11 bagmen approached those selected ATMs. They contacted the hackers overseas who managed to force the ATMs to dispense cash to them. Then they handed the stolen money to Pencov Nicolae, Colibaba Mihail, Peregudovs Andrejs and the other 4 bagmen who were responsible for hiding and transferring the filthy lucre. (b) The Modus Operandi of the Criminal Syndicate 6 The digital forensic laboratory of the Investigation Bureau, Ministry of Justice (MJIB) managed to recover the digital evidence from the wiped ATM hard drives seized by the police, based on which the instruments of crime and the log-in information were identified and the traces of pertinent program execution were found. The FCB London branch’s firewall log also helped reveal the traces of the hackers’ infiltration route into FCB’s intranet. The criminal syndicate’s modus operandi was thus verified. By virtue of all the pieces of evidence gathered and analyzed, the MJIB confirmed that the foreign criminal syndicate infiltrated FCB’s intranet, stole the money from selected FCB ATMs by planting homemade malware, and tried to hide and transfer the illicit money. Their modus operandi proceeded as follows: Step 1 : Hacking into the call recording server of the FCB London branch Checking the outbound connection attempts recorded in the FCB London branch’s firewall log, the MJIB found that the call recording server at that branch had abnormal connections with an unknown IP address in Switzerland (IP: 95. 183. 53. 210) at 22 : 36 : 15 on 31 May 2016. Step 2 : Infiltrating FCB’s intranet and remotely controlling its server After the criminal <b>syndicate</b> <b>managed</b> to infiltrate the call recording server of the FCB London branch on 31 May 2016, it firstly cracked the administrator’s account and password, and then accessed FCB’s intranet and the PCs used by the bank’s employees. On 11 June 2016, the criminal syndicate took the call recording server of the FCB London branch as a relay server, and then infiltrated the bank’s NCR server (produced by the NCR Systems Taiwan Ltd. and used for updating FCB’s NCR ATM programs). On 17 June 2016, the syndicate logged in the FCB intranet with the administrator’s account and collected the information it needed. Step 3 : Distributing package files, collecting information of the ATMs, and deploying malware After taking control over the AP server, the criminal syndicate successively distributed the utility programs disguised as the package files (with the filename extension “. DMS”) for FCB’s ATM updating programs. Then the syndicate used the AP server with the administrator’s account and password to distribute the abnormal package files to some of the bank’s ATMs. On 4 July 2016, the syndicate began to intensively distribute the package files to FCB’s ATMs in order to crack the Telnet server. It not only developed, distributed and executed programs such as the abovementioned abnormal package files to gather the information about FCB’s ATMs, but also deployed cash-dispensing programs (cnginfo. exe, cngdisp. ex, and cngdisp_new. exea) and programs for destroying the evidence (cleanup. bat and sdelete. exe) in the NCR server that operates FTP service, allowing its bagmen to download the programs and withdraw the money from the selected ATMs. Step 4 : Perpetrating the crime From 9 to 11 July 2016, Berezovskiy Sergey and the other 11 bagmen of the criminal syndicate approached the selected FCB ATMs in Taiwan, contacting the members who remotely controlled the call recording server of the FCB London branch to connect and control the cracked ATMs via the Telnet server. Then the bagmen downloaded and executed the programs such as cnginfo. exe, and cngdisp. exe pre-installed in the NCR server through the FTP service, making those ATMs dispense cash to them. After the ATMs finished dispensing cash, the bagmen executed the program cleanup. bat (containing Sdelete. exe, a Microsoft software used for erasing data from hard drives) 32 times with the instruction “Sdelete – p 32,” which made it extremely difficult for the MJIB to recover the erased records with available forensic tools. The 12 bagmen then took and hid the illicit money. Step 5 : Destroying the evidence After the criminal syndicate got the illicit money from all the selected FCB ATMs on 12 July 2016, it cracked FCB’s ATM distribution system (AP server) again and distributed 5 abnormal package files to those ATMs, thereby further destroying all the scraps of evidence pertinent to the crime. 3. The Need for International Cooperation Examining the FCB London branch’s firewall log, the MJIB found that the call recording server at the branch had abnormal connections with an unknown IP address in Switzerland (IP: 95. 183. 53. 210) at 22 : 36 : 15 on 31 May 2016. However, Taiwan is {{not a member of the}} Interpol, and has no official relationship and mutual legal assistance agreement with Switzerland, which prevented the MJIB from accessing the IP address and related information. It was with the cooperation from foreign law enforcement agencies such as the National Crime Agency in the United Kingdom and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States that the MJIB was able to gather and trace the registration and log-in information of the IP address as well as other forensic evidence. Such a practice stood as testimony to the important fact that international cooperation is of urgent necessity for combating transnational organized crime. إدارة المؤتمرا...|$|R
