40|$|Abstract We {{compared}} {{seven different}} tagging single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) programs in 10 regions with varied amounts of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and physical distance. We used the Collaborative Studies on the Genetics of Alcoholism dataset, {{part of the}} Genetic Analysis Workshop 14. We show that in regions with moderate to strong LD these programs are relatively consistent, despite different parameters and methods. In addition, we compared the selected SNPs in a multipoint linkage analysis for one region with strong LD. As the number of selected SNPs increased, the LOD score, <b>mean</b> <b>information</b> <b>content,</b> and type I error also increased. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a quantification of uncertainties of total column water vapour retrievals based on simulated near-infrared measurements of upcoming instruments. The concepts of three scheduled spectrometers {{were taken into}} account: OLCI (Ocean and Land Color Instrument) on Sentinel- 3, METimage on an EPS-SG (EUMETSAT Polar System – Second Generation) satellite and FCI (Flexible Combined Imager) on MTG (Meteosat Third Generation). Optimal estimation theory was used to estimate the error of a hypothetical total water vapour column retrieval for 27 different atmospheric cases. The errors range from 100 % in very dry cases to 2 % in humid cases with a very high surface albedo. Generally, the absolute uncertainties increase with higher water vapour column content due to H 2 O-saturation and decrease with a brighter surface albedo. Uncertainties increase with higher aerosol optical thickness, apart from very dark cases. Overall, the METimage channel setting enables the most accurate retrievals. The retrieval using the MTG-FCI build-up has the highest uncertainties apart from very bright cases. On the one hand, a retrieval using two absorption channels increases the accuracy, in some cases by one order of magnitude, in comparison to a retrieval using just one absorption channel. On the other hand, a retrieval using three absorption channels has no significant advantage over a two-absorption channel retrieval. Furthermore, the optimal position of the absorption channels was determined using {{the concept of the}} "information content". For a single channel retrieval, a channel at 900 or 915 nm has the highest <b>mean</b> <b>information</b> <b>content</b> over all cases. The second absorption channel is ideally weakly correlated with the first one, and therefore positioned at 935 nm, in a region with stronger water vapour absorption...|$|E
40|$|The {{dependence}} of the depth of field In a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image on the accelerating voltage is presented. The depth of field depends on the accelerating voltage of the primary beam and on the signal-to-noise ratio of the image if it is evaluated by calculating the image resolution along the optical axis {{defined in terms of}} the information passing capacity (IPC) of an optical system. The IPC corresponds to the <b>mean</b> <b>information</b> <b>content</b> included in an optical image, i. e., the quality of the image, evaluated based on the theory of Iinfoot. The calculated result has agreed well with the experimental result. Key words: scanning electron microscope (SEM), field depth, information passing capacity, resolution, accelerating voltage The depth of field (Df) in an SEM image, in the con-ventional definition, is given by 1 ' = d/{aM), (1) where d corresponds to the resolving power of the human eye. M and a are the magnification of the image and the beam convergence half angle, respectively. It is known that this method agrees well with experimental results when the magnification is relatively low such as a few thousands times or less. We have found from experiments, however, that the actual depth of field is much deeper than the value obtained by Eq. (1) in the case of high resolution observations using an in-lens type field emission SEM (Hitachi S- 5000). This phenomenon is remarkable for low-voltage operation. This shows that a new method is needed for evaluating the depth of field in high resolution work. The depth of field is regarded as the range (depth) on the optical axis z where the image resolutions Ra(z) along the axis satisfies the following equation (See Fig. 1) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{unconventional}} image segmentation approach which is devised {{to meet the}} requirements of image understanding and pattern recognition tasks. Generally image understanding assumes interplay of two sub-processes: image <b>information</b> <b>content</b> discovery and image <b>information</b> <b>content</b> interpretation. Despite of its widespread use, the notion of "image information content" is still ill defined, intuitive, and ambiguous. Most often, it is used in the Shannon's sense, which <b>means</b> <b>information</b> <b>content</b> assessment averaged over the whole signal ensemble. Humans, however,rarely resort to such estimates. They are very effective in decomposing images into their meaningful constituents and focusing attention to the perceptually relevant image parts. We posit that following the latest findings in human attention vision studies and the concepts of Kolmogorov's complexity theory an unorthodox segmentation approach can be proposed that provides effective image decomposition to information preserving image fragments well suited for subsequent image interpretation. We provide some illustrative examples, demonstrating effectiveness of this approach. Comment: 14 th Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis (SCIA 2005...|$|R

40|$|Because of {{the high}} costs {{associated}} with ascertainment of families, most linkage studies of Bipolar I disorder (BPI) have used relatively small samples. Moreover, the genetic information content reported in most studies has been less than 0. 6. Although microsatellite markers spaced every 10 [*]cM typically extract most of the genetic information content for larger multiplex families, they can be less informative for smaller pedigrees especially for affected sib pair kindreds. For these reasons we collaborated to pool family resources and carried out higher density genotyping. Approximately 1100 pedigrees of European ancestry were initially selected for study and were genotyped by the Center for Inherited Disease Research using the Illumina Linkage Panel 12 set of 6090 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Of the ~ 1100 families, 972 were informative for further analyses, and <b>mean</b> <b>information</b> <b>content</b> was 0. 86 after pruning for linkage disequilibrium. The 972 kindreds include 2284 cases of BPI disorder, 498 individuals with bipolar II disorder (BPII) and 702 subjects with recurrent major depression. Three affection status models (ASMs) were considered: ASM 1 (BPI and schizoaffective disorder, BP cases (SABP) only), ASM 2 (ASM 1 cases plus BPII) and ASM 3 (ASM 2 cases plus recurrent major depression). Both parametric and non-parametric linkage methods were carried out. The strongest findings occurred at 6 q 21 (non-parametric pairs LOD 3. 4 for rs 1046943 at 119 [*]cM) and 9 q 21 (non-parametric pairs logarithm of odds (LOD) 3. 4 for rs 722642 at 78 [*]cM) using only BPI and schizoaffective (SA), BP cases. Both results met genome-wide significant criteria, although neither was significant after correction for multiple analyses. We also inspected parametric scores for the larger multiplex families to identify possible rare susceptibility loci. In this analysis, we observed 59 parametric LODs of 2 or greater, {{many of which are}} likely to be close to maximum possible scores. Although some linkage findings may be false positives, the results could help prioritize the search for rare variants using whole exome or genome sequencing...|$|E

30|$|In another {{multiscale}} model, reducing NMDAR {{activity was}} associated with changes in information processing in neocortex [73]. The model contained two populations of excitatory cells (regular spiking and intrinsically bursting) and two populations of inhibitory cells (fast-spiking and low-threshold spiking), organized across the multiple layers of neocortex. These were conductance-based cellular models with three compartments—one somatic and two dendritic. NMDAR and AMPAR were located on the dendrites, while GABA_A receptors were located on the soma. Increasing the gamma activity generated by the model permitted less information to propagate from outside into the network. This effect can be understood by noting that information in the Shannon sense is related to entropy, or degree of unpredictability, where lower predictability <b>means</b> higher <b>information</b> <b>content.</b> Greater stereotypy (higher predictability) in the dynamical pattern (higher gamma) meant reduced variability, leading to reduced entropy and reduced information-carrying capacity. This compares with clinical observation, where the thought pattern of patients suffering from schizophrenia shows greater stereotypical phenomena (e.g., echolalia and perseveration), associated with a reduction in global (gestalt) perceptual responsivity.|$|R
30|$|From the 98 InDel markers {{tested for}} single copy and polymorphism, 19 markers {{were used to}} {{evaluate}} 43 Thai and 57 IRRI germplasm, including improved cultivars, breeding lines, landraces, and 5 other Oryza species. The Thai accessions were selected from all rice ecologies such as irrigated, deep water, upland, and rainfed lowland ecosystems. The IRRI accessions were groups of germplasm having agronomic desirable traits, including temperature-sensitive genetic male sterility (TGMS), new plant type, early flowering, and biotic and abiotic stress resistances. Most of the InDel markers were genes with diverse functions. These markers produced the total of 127 alleles for all loci, {{with a mean of}} 6.68 alleles per locus, and a <b>mean</b> Polymorphic <b>Information</b> <b>Content</b> (PIC) of 0.440. Genetic diversity of Thai rice were 0.3665, 0.4479 and 0.3972 for improved cultivars, breeding lines, and landraces, respectively, while genetic diversity of IRRI improved and breeding lines were 0.3272 and 0.2970, respectively. Cluster, structure, and differentiation analyses showed six distinct groups: japonica, TGMS, deep-water, IRRI germplasm, Thai landraces and breeding lines, and other Oryza species.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the process of}} order determining of elements connection as a stage of preproduction engineering for the use in the design phase of production department organization structure. The initial data are: given design object (production department), operating conditions and options of equipment. Conventional approaches are considered; a new method is proposed notable for better visualization. The essence of the approach lies in replacement of the simplified contour shapes and symbolic notations on unified three-dimensional models (UTM). UTM is a three-dimensional model created from the real object - prototype by means of generalizing abstraction. The best known representative of the group is chosen as a prototype. Stepwise method of UTM creating is presented. Testing results of the method for two specific groups of technological equipment are given: screw-cutting equipment and industrial manipulators with an anthropomorphic arm. An original program module is developed that {{works in conjunction with}} additional <b>means</b> for <b>information</b> <b>content</b> enhancement according to the algorithm of creation of multi-component 3 D-models. The proposed solution is intended for developers of automated preproduction engineering systems...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{access to}} learner support {{services}} and digital content {{have been transformed}} {{as a result of}} the availability of relatively low-cost mobile (m) devices and sophisticated m-applications. However, the limited input functionalities of m-devices <b>means</b> accessing <b>information,</b> <b>content</b> and services is often an unfriendly user experience ultimately affecting the uptake of m-technologies within the institution. To increase the impact of m-deployments the Waikato Institute of Technology is actively exploring the potential of Quick Response (QR) Codes to enable ready access for stakeholder. During this exploration a framework, A. C. E, has been used firstly, to guide the introduction of QR learning activities undertaken within the institution and secondly, to provide a diagrammatic overview to increase institutional awareness of these technologies. The A. C. E. framework is underpinned by three As, Cs and Es. It is aligned with the identifiable stages of a project life cycle, the foundation pillars of flexible learning and indicators of how e-deployments can be monitored. This interactive presentation will encourage participants to critically review how the ACE framework for the introduction of QR codes within the institution has been constructed...|$|R
40|$|Transposable element-based {{molecular}} markers can {{be utilized}} to investigate genetic diversity {{and to create}} genetic linkage maps. In this study, Class I and class II transposons were employed to obtain a comparative account of genetic diversity between wild and cultivated barley genotypes. Three types of PCR-based techniques were used: IMP (Inter MITE Polymorphism), IRAP (Inter-Retrotransposon Amplified Polymorphism) and REMAP (Retrotransposon-Microsatellite Amplified Polymorphism). Specific primer pairs for IMP, IRAP, and REMAP detected a total of 200 bands {{with an average of}} 20 bands per marker. The <b>mean</b> polymorphic <b>information</b> <b>content</b> (PIC) and discrimination power (D) values in all 47 genotypes from these three types of transposon-based polymorphisms were 0. 910 and 0. 935, respectively. Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) -based cluster analysis classified all 47 genotypes, both wild and cultivated, into separate groups consistent with their geographical origins. Sequencing followed by chromosome location of polymorphic bands enables precise gene introgression from wild gene pool to cultivated barley. The highly polymorphic nature of these marker systems makes them suitable for use in varietal identification and MAS-based breeding programs in barley and other cereals...|$|R
