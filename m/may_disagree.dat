5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they <b>may</b> <b>disagree</b> about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E

50|$|While utilitarianists <b>may</b> {{slightly}} <b>disagree</b> on why {{the evil}} of punishment can be justified, authors agree {{that the purpose of}} punishment is to reduce crime. This purpose directly relates to the principle of distribution of utilitarianism. Most utilitarianists agree that there are three ways to reduce crime: incapacitation, deterrence and reform.|$|R
25|$|In theory, {{when exercising}} {{judicial}} review of administrative action, the Court's task is only {{to ensure that the}} decision in question was made according to the law. Even though it <b>may</b> <b>disagree</b> with the decision, it will not substitute its own decision for that of the decision-maker. In practice, however, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the Court is applying that principle. The branch of law dealing with this facet of the Court's jurisdiction is administrative law.|$|E
25|$|Acarine {{ontogeny}} typically {{consists of}} an egg, a prelarval stage (often absent), a larval stage (hexapod except in Eriophyoidea which have only two pairs of legs), {{and a series of}} nymphal stages. Any or all of these stages except the adult may be suppressed or occur only within the body of a previous stage. Larvae (and prelarvae) have a maximum of three pairs of legs (legs are often reduced to stubs or absent in prelarvae); legs IV are added at the first nymphal stage. Usually, a maximum of three nymphal stages are present and they are referred to in sequence as the protonymph, deutonymph, and tritonymph; however, some soft ticks have supernumerary nymphal stages. The females of some Tarsonemidae bear sexually mature young. If one or more nymphal stages are absent, then authors <b>may</b> <b>disagree</b> on which stages are present. Only the Oribatida pass through all developmental stages.|$|E
25|$|The synod {{teaches that}} the Word of God, both written and preached, and the Sacraments are means of grace {{through which the}} Holy Spirit gives the gift of God's grace, creates faith {{in the hearts of}} individuals, forgives sins for the sake of Christ's death on the cross, and grants eternal life and salvation. Many Missouri Synod Lutherans define a sacrament as an action instituted by Jesus that {{combines}} a promise in God's Word with a physical element, although the synod holds no official definition for sacrament. This means that some <b>may</b> <b>disagree</b> on the number of sacraments. All agree that Baptism and Communion are sacraments. Confession and absolution is called a sacrament in the Apology of the Augsburg Confession and so is also considered by many Lutherans to be a sacrament, because it was instituted by Christ and has His promise of grace, even though it is not tied to a physical element.|$|E

50|$|Immunoblasts have {{significant}} basophilic cytoplasm and a central nucleolus. A tumor {{can be classified}} as immunoblastic if greater than 90% of its cells are immunoblasts.This distinction can be problematic, however, because hematopathologists reviewing the microscope slides <b>may</b> often <b>disagree</b> on whether a collection of cells is best characterized as centroblasts or immunoblasts. Such disagreement indicates poor inter-rater reliability.|$|R
50|$|First {{there was}} a drag race which Hammond was unable {{to take part in}} as his car broke down due to the alarm (for which he was deducted 1,000 points): {{accelerate}} to 100 mph then stop again. May won comfortably as his car proved to be in better mechanical condition than Clarkson's. This led to Clarkson claiming that speed is not everything and <b>May</b> <b>disagreeing,</b> in stark contrast to their usual opinions. Next the cars were examined by a forensics team to test the condition of their interior. Clarkson's car contained crisps, leaves, and his own dried skin, which he claimed was not disgusting at all and lost no points. May's car was in worse condition with nasal mucus, scabs and saliva costing him 30 points. Hammond again fared the worst with saliva, blood and pubic hairs, losing 30 points and, worst of all, feces losing another 1,000 points. Next, thieves attempted to steal all three cars: Clarkson and May's cars were still there after 20 minutes, but Hammond's was stolen almost immediately losing him yet another 1,000 points.|$|R

5000|$|There {{has been}} dispute {{as to the}} {{historical}} accuracy of Fair Game. Two claims in the film caused vastly differing responses among political analysts. The first is that Joe Wilson's fact-finding trip to Niger served to debunk a British claim that Saddam Hussein had earlier tried to obtain uranium from Niger. In a November 2010 Washington Post column about the film, Walter Pincus and Richard Leiby, two reporters who had covered the Plame affair, wrote that this characterization was accurate. In National Review, journalist Clifford <b>May</b> <b>disagreed,</b> writing that, rather than debunking the uranium claim, Wilson's trip and report had actually bolstered it, because [...] "the most important piece of information Wilson brought back from his mission to Africa was that a high-level Iraqi trade mission had visited Niger in 1999." [...] A December 2010 Washington Post editorial also disagreed with Pincus and Leiby, citing the 2004 British Butler Review, which stated that the original claim by the British government was accurate. In response, journalist David Corn, writing in Mother Jones, wrote that, contrary to the Butler Review, the CIA had stated in a private memo that the British uranium claim had been an exaggeration.|$|R
40|$|G. A. Cohen {{argues that}} Rawlsian constructivism mistakenly conflates {{principles}} of justice with optimal rules of regulation, a confusion that arises out of how Rawls has us think about justice. I use the concepts/conceptions distinction {{to argue that}} while citizens <b>may</b> reasonably <b>disagree</b> about the substance and demands of justice, some principled convergence may be possible: we can agree upon regulative principles consistent with justice, as each of us understands it. Rawlian constructivism helps us find that principled convergence, and this too is a conception of justice...|$|R
5000|$|The {{fundamental}} {{doctrines of}} some religions are {{considered by some}} to be illogical, contrary to experience, or unsupported by sufficient evidence, and are rejected for those reasons. Even some believers may have difficulty accepting particular religious assertions or doctrines. Some people believe the body of evidence available to humans to be insufficient to justify certain religious beliefs. They <b>may</b> thus <b>disagree</b> with religious interpretations of ethics and human purpose, or various creation myths. This reason has perhaps been aggravated by the protestations of some fundamentalist Christians.|$|R
2500|$|There is some {{professional}} disagreement as to {{what exactly}} technical diving encompasses. Nitrox diving and rebreather diving were originally considered technical, {{but this is no}} longer universally the case as several certification agencies now offer Recreational Nitrox and recreational rebreather training and certification. Some training agencies classify penetration diving in wrecks and caves as technical diving. Even those who agree on the broad definitions of technical diving <b>may</b> <b>disagree</b> on the precise boundaries between technical and recreational diving.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, Williams' {{impact on}} the field of study has proved of lasting significance. As Barbara Solow and Stanley Engerman put it in the preface to a {{compilation}} of essays on Williams that was based on a commemorative symposium held in Italy in 1984, Williams [...] "defined the study of Caribbean history, and its writing affected the course of Caribbean history.... Scholars <b>may</b> <b>disagree</b> on his ideas, but they remain the starting point of discussion.... Any conference on British capitalism and Caribbean slavery is a conference on Eric Williams." ...|$|E

Within a single school district, there can be substantial differences {{in the distribution of}} measured IQ. (The IQ for the top percentile at a high-performing school may be quite different from that at a lower performing school.) ...|$|E
50|$|Critical Stage: In {{the third}} stage of {{analytical}} reading, Adler directs the reader to critique the book. He asserts that upon understanding the author's propositions and arguments, the reader has been elevated to the author's level of understanding and is now able (and obligated) to judge the book's merit and accuracy. Adler advocates judging books based on the soundness of their arguments. Adler says that one <b>may</b> not <b>disagree</b> with an argument unless one can find fault in its reasoning, facts, or premises, though one is free to dislike it in any case.|$|R

In May 1935 Adolf Hitler made a well publicised speech in which he proclaimed that German rearmament offered no threat to world peace. That month Mottistone told the House of Lords that [...] "we ought to assume that it is genuine and sincere...I have had many interviews with Herr Hitler.

Nonetheless, the trading partners can hammer out a local coordination, despite vast global differences.

2500|$|Socialist Studies {{adopted the}} object and {{principles}} of the Socialist Party of Great Britain, and thus claims to hold that party's general ideology and stance on most social, economic, and political issues. [...] However, there are several ideological and practical differences between Socialist Studies and the Socialist Party of Great Britain, most of which arise from the former's narrower interpretation of {{the object and}} principles and its views on how strictly these interpretations must be adhered to.

2500|$|In {{the words}} of Rachel's parents: [...] "The act, while we <b>may</b> <b>disagree</b> with it, must be put into context. Rachel was partaking in a {{demonstration}} in Gaza opposing the War on Iraq. She was working with children who drew two pictures, one of the American flag, {{and one of the}} Israeli flag, for burning. Rachel said that she could not bring herself to burn the picture of the Israeli flag with the Star of David on it, but under such circumstances, in protest over a drive towards war and her government's foreign policy that was responsible for much of the devastation that she was witness to in Gaza, she felt it OK to burn the picture of her own flag. We have seen photographs of memorials held in Gaza after Rachel's death in which Palestinian children and adults honor our daughter by carrying a mock coffin draped with the American flag. We have been told that our flag has never been treated so respectfully in Gaza in recent years. We believe Rachel brought a different face of the United States to the Palestinian people, a face of compassion. It is this image of Rachel with the American flag that we hope will be remembered most." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} to incentivising monitoring for norm violations in open multi-agent systems such as Wikipedia. In such systems, there is no crisp definition of a norm violation; rather, {{it is a matter}} of judgement whether an agent’s behaviour conforms to generally accepted standards of behaviour. Agents <b>may</b> legitimately <b>disagree</b> about borderline cases. Using ideas from scrip systems and peer prediction, we show how to design a mechanism that incentivises agents to monitor each other’s behaviour for norm violations. The mechanism keeps the probability of undetected violations (submissions that the majority of the community would consider not conforming to standards) low, and is robust against collusion by the monitoring agents...|$|R
