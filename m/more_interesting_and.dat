After the episode, it was moved into the Simpsons' basement, where it has since reappeared as a prop {{in the background of}} several episodes, although never in a major role. The design was partially based on real Olmec heads, but changed to look <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> grotesque.|$|E
5|$|Grisedale Tarn is the {{starting}} point for the south ridge of Helvellyn, and may be reached from Grasmere or Patterdale, or from Dunmail Raise by a path alongside Raise Beck. Above the tarn the old pony track zigzags up the fellside, and takes a safe but unexciting route well away from crags {{on the side of the}} ridge, and avoiding all the intermediate tops. In suitable weather a <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> scenic route is to follow the edge of the crags as closely as possible, over the tops of Dollywagon Pike, High Crag and Nethermost Pike.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{originally}} wrote Veronica Mars as a {{young adult}} novel, featuring a male as the protagonist. He changed {{the gender of the}} protagonist because he thought a noir piece told from a female point of view would be <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> unique. The original pilot script was darker in tone than the one filmed, and several details were changed. Although it ranked low in the ratings, the pilot was critically acclaimed and Bell's performance as the protagonist was praised.|$|E

5|$|Central Saint Giles {{provides}} 66,090m² {{of floor}} space – almost {{double that of}} the old St Giles Court – split between two separate buildings. The 15-storey west block is for residential use, providing 109 flats of which 53 are designated as affordable. The much larger horseshoe-shaped eastern block, standing 11 storeys high, encircles a publicly accessible courtyard comprising 27% of the site's area. It provides 37,625m² of office space with {{by far the largest}} floor plates of any office block in the West End of London, with 4,000m² on all but the top two floors. At ground level, 2,276m² of space is available for retail outlets and restaurants. The block is irregularly shaped with recesses, projections and roof terraces intended to make it look <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> to break up its bulk.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{initially}} wrote Veronica Mars as a {{young adult}} novel, which featured a male protagonist; he changed the gender because he thought a noir piece told from a female point of view would be <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> original. Filming began in March 2004, and the series premiered in September to 2.49 million American viewers. The critically acclaimed first season's run of 22 episodes garnered an average of 2.5 million viewers per episode in the United States. Veronica Mars appeared {{on a number of}} fall television best lists, and garnered several awards and nominations. During the series' run, it was nominated for two Satellite Awards, four Saturn Awards, five Teen Choice Awards and was featured on AFI's TV Programs of the Year for 2005.|$|E

25|$|Although her novels were {{hugely popular}} during her lifetime, Burney's {{reputation}} as a writer of fiction suffered after her death {{at the hands of}} biographers and critics, who felt that the extensive diaries, published posthumously in 1842–46, offered a <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> accurate portrait of 18th-century life. Today critics are returning to her novels and plays with renewed interest in her outlook on the social lives and struggles of women in a predominantly male-oriented culture. Scholars continue to value Burney's diaries as well for their candid depictions of English society in her time.|$|E
25|$|A summability method M is regular if it {{agrees with}} the actual limit on all {{convergent}} series. Such a result is called an Abelian theorem for M, from the prototypical Abel's theorem. <b>More</b> <b>interesting,</b> <b>and</b> in general more subtle, are partial converse results, called tauberian theorems, from a prototype proved by Alfred Tauber. Here partial converse means that if M sums the series Σ, and some side-condition holds, then Σ was convergent in the first place; without any side-condition such a result would say that M only summed convergent series (making it useless as a summation method for divergent series).|$|E
25|$|First, Archie is not {{a friend}} but a paid employee, who acts as secretary, chauffeur, and legman to the mountainous and {{sedentary}} Wolfe. Then they differ in all important respects—age, background, physique, and education. Finally, {{it is impossible to}} say which is the <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> admirable of the two. They are complementary in the unheard-of ratio of 50-50. … Archie has talents without which Wolfe would be lost: his remarkable memory, trained physical power, brash American humor, attractiveness to women, and ability to execute the most difficult errand virtually without instructions. Minus Archie, Wolfe would be a feckless recluse puttering in an old house on West 35th Street, New York.|$|E

25|$|When {{the user}} encrypts files {{after the first}} stage of such an attack, the FEKs are {{automatically}} encrypted with the designated DRA's public key. The attacker only needs to access the computer once more as Administrator to gain full access to all those subsequently EFS-encrypted files. Even using Syskey mode 2 or 3 does not protect against this attack, because the attacker could back up the encrypted files offline, restore them elsewhere and use the DRA's private key to decrypt the files. Of course, if such a malicious insider can gain physical access to the computer, you might consider all security features to be irrelevant, because they could also install rootkits, software or even hardware keyloggers etc. on the computer – which is potentially much <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> effective than overwriting DRA policy.|$|E
25|$|Wanting {{to go back}} to his {{interesting}} life, Kyon activates {{the program}} and goes back in time to the Tanabata of three years ago. After meeting up with the future Mikuru, he obtains an uninstall program from the past's Yuki, which needs to be shot at the culprit right after the change in the early hours of December 18. Returning to the present, they find the culprit, Yuki, who had borrowed Haruhi's power to change everyone's memories except Kyon's, giving him the choice of which world he would rather live in. Kyon questions himself about his choice and thinks to himself that a normal world without the SOS Brigade and Haruhi Suzumiya would be calm and peaceful and thinks Yuki was tired of everything she had to do like monitoring Haruhi's behavior and protecting Kyon, but finally decides that his original world was <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> fun. Kyon tries to install the program into Yuki but is stabbed by Ryoko, who had retained her psychotic behavior. Before Ryoko can finish him off, he is rescued by future counterparts of Yuki, Mikuru and himself. He wakes up a few days later in a hospital, where the world is back to normal, but almost everyone believes Kyon had been in a coma since December 18 after falling down the stairs. When Yuki mentions to Kyon how the Data Integration Thought Entity would punish her for her actions, Kyon tells her to let them know that if they ever try such a thing, he can tell Haruhi about him being John Smith and have her alter reality so the organization would cease to exist. As December 24 comes and his everyday life returns, Kyon decides there is still time before he has to go back in time to save himself and decides to join in on the Christmas party.|$|E

[...] He recommended that Chester Beach (credited with the design of the 1923 Monroe Doctrine coin) or Robert I.

In Le Temps, Francisque Sarcey panned the play with a brief notice, claiming that all the other plays running that week were [...] "far <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> entertaining." [...] He noted the innovative Verne-d'Ennery idea of using the human characters of Volsius and Ox to represent good and evil in the fantasy, rather than resorting to the typical [...] "Good Fairy" [...] and [...] "Bad Fairy" [...] characters in such plays, but added that he [...] "didn't quite see what we've gained by the substitution." ...|$|E
