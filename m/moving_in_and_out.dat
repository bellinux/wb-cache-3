5|$|Like many low-mass stars, Gliese 876 is a {{variable}} star. Its variable star designation is IL Aquarii {{and it is}} classified as a BY Draconis variable. Its brightness fluctuates by around 0.04 magnitudes. This type of variability {{is thought to be}} caused by large starspots <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of view as the star rotates. Gliese 876 emits X-rays.|$|E
5|$|At Monte Cassino the {{historic}} abbey overlooked Allied positions below. Ground commanders were sure the monastery {{was being used}} by the Germans as an observation post. Lieutenant-General Bernard C. Freyberg, commander of the New Zealand Corps preparing for a new assault on the mountain, had repeatedly requested that the abbey be bombed. Taking advantage of the German practice of not giving away their positions by firing on small planes, Devers and Eaker flew low over the monastery, and saw what they believed to be a radio aerial and enemy soldiers <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out.</b> Wilson reluctantly agreed to its bombing. On 15 February Devers watched waves of American bombers level the monastery with Alexander, Clark, Freyberg and Eaker. But follow-up attacks that day, and over the next eight days, failed to take the position, much less break the Gustav Line. Devers visited Anzio on 16 February, and agreed with Alexander that Lucas should be relieved. Clark did so on 22 February.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} breathe like mammals, with airflow <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more like birds, with airflow {{moving in a}} unidirectional loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, air flows through the trachea and into two primary bronchi, or airways, which branch off into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then into even narrower tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the bronchial tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional airflow {{without the aid of}} avian-like air sacs.|$|E

5|$|Seoul unit {{director}} Dan Glass and Jim Mitchell {{were the}} visual effects supervisors {{of the first}} season. The season had a total VFX shot count of about 1200. An in-house VFX team was established in Chicago which completed over 700 shots. The major external VFX vendors were Locktix VFX (160-180 shots), Technicolor VFX (over 100 shots) and Encore VFX. Additional work was done by Studio 8 FX, Trace VFX and Almost Gold. Because of the series' tight budget and timeline the production {{made the decision to}} do most of the effects in-camera and only enhance them digitally where appropriate. In fact for a great number of shots which involved the sensates communicating and visiting each other telepathically the cast were simply <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the frame in timely fashion requiring no additional work. According to Glass, most of the VFX work that was done is invisible in the final show and consisted mostly of split-screens, crew and rig removal, weather augmentation and screen inserts. Executive producer Grant Hill commented he would be impressed if one would be able to recognize as many as 150 of the 1200 VFX shots, because most of them consisted of small things used to help the narrative, and they do not call attention to themselves. Of the more visible work done, Glass provided the examples of age manipulation of actors, dramatic enhancement of the weather in the car scenes in Iceland, a few greenscreens, and computer generated blades, blood and wounds.|$|E

25|$|Groups {{of human}} beings, left free to each {{regulate}} themselves, tend to produce spontaneous order, {{rather than the}} meaningless chaos often feared. This has been observed in society at least since Chuang Tzu in ancient China. A classic traffic roundabout is a good example, with cars <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> with such effective organization that some modern cities have begun replacing stoplights at problem intersections with traffic circles , and getting better results. Open-source software and Wiki projects form an even more compelling illustration.|$|E

Throughout the late spring and summer, the Samarrans and Baghdadis regularly engaged each other around the defensive fortifications of the city and inflicted many casualties on each other, but neither side was able to gain a clear advantage. Over the following months, the fighting spread to the districts neighboring Baghdad, as both sides fought to control the routes leading into the city.

40|$|The main {{obstacle}} for coherent {{control of}} open quantum systems is decoherence due to different dissipation channels {{and the inability}} to precisely control experimental parameters. To overcome these problems we propose to use dissipation-assisted adiabatic passages.

As a concrete example we present a scheme to entangle atoms by <b>moving</b> them <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of an optical cavity...|$|R
500|$|Although {{the novel}} is often {{referred}} to as [...] "a mystery", it is not an example of whodunit or detective fiction. Instead, the central puzzles are the origins of suffering and the motivations of unusual behavior. Characters appear in fragments, with brief scenes providing small clues about their identity. Vautrin, for example, slips in and out of the story– offering advice to Rastignac, ridiculing Goriot, bribing the housekeeper Christophe to let him in after hours– before he is revealed as a master criminal. This pattern of people <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of view mirrors Balzac's use of characters throughout La Comédie humaine.|$|E
500|$|There {{was wide}} {{commentary}} {{in the news}} media about the social situation in and around Moston. Writing in The Times, Jon Ronson focused on Manchester's apparent economic imbalance, pointing out that while [...] "superficially, it is a city of growth" [...] — hosting international environmental conferences in 1993 and bidding to host the 2000 Olympic Games — this could not disguise the realities of the poor quality of [...] "built-to-collapse" [...] housing, the city council's policy on homelessness, poverty, street violence and drug culture, all of which played parts in the events leading up to Capper's murder. The city, he said, had violent 'no-go' areas, where [...] "you can expect to be mugged," [...] created through drug abuse and hopelessness, and populated by people who [...] "don't work, have no money, and rarely leave the houses that they find themselves living in before dark." [...] Ronson highlighted a city of contrasts, where [...] "expensive canal-side cafes are springing up faster than you can count them: the joke around town is that you can sip cappuccino all day and gaze out at the corpses floating past." [...] David Ward, writing in The Guardian, similarly drew attention to the housing policies, and quoted an older Moston resident as saying: [...] "These people are <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> every three months. They're illiterate half of them — just shagging and having kids." [...] The Daily Mail – in what Barker and Petley called [...] "ideological overdrive" [...] – described Capper's killers as [...] "the product of a society that tolerates petty crime, the break-up of families and feckless spending... Most of Suzanne's tormentors were on social security... an underclass which is a grave threat to Britain's future." [...] Author Carol Anne Davis agreed that when looking for answers about how this crime came about one need only [...] "look at the upbringings of these women who were single parents to three children by their mid twenties, had teenage boyfriends who were barely legal and who supported themselves through drug dealing and theft." ...|$|E

40|$|Magnetic and magnetocaloric {{properties}} of ErAlO 3 single crystal were investigated. Magnetization of ErAlO 3 shows obvious anisotropy when magnetic field is applied along the a, b and c axes, {{which leads to}} large anisotropic magnetic entropy change. In particular, large rotating field entropy change from the b to c axis within the bc plane is obtained and reaches 9. 7 J/kg K at 14 K {{in a field of}} 5 T.
