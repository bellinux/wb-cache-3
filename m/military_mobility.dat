50|$|In 1859, {{the first}} European {{settlement}} was established when Father Charles Pandosy led {{the making of}} an Oblate mission at Okanagan Mission, now a neighbourhood of Kelowna. The Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858 eventually encouraged more settlement as some prospectors from the United States took the Okanagan Trail route {{on their way to}} the Fraser Canyon, although at the height of the rush the American adventurers who used the route did not settle because of outright hostilities from the Syilx, whom a few of the parties traversing the trail had harassed and brutalized. A few staked claims around the South Okanagan and Similkameen valleys and found gold and copper in places, with another trail from Fort Hope to newer goldfields at Rock Creek and Wild Horse Creek in the East Kootenay, skirting the US border and crossing Osoyoos Lake at Osoyoos, which was a customs post and also the location of the gold commissioner's office. The Dewdney Trail, surveyed and built by Edgar Dewdney, was constructed to prevent trade in the region from going north-south instead of remaining firmly under British control, and also for <b>military</b> <b>mobility</b> purposes should the need arise. In the decades following the gold rushes, ranchers, mostly on military land grants, came to settle on Okanagan Lake; notable ones included the Coldstream Ranch near Vernon, the Ellis Ranch, which formed the basis of the City of Penticton once subdivided, and the Richter Ranch, which continues in operation today, in the mountains between the Town of Oliver and the Village of Keremeos in the Similkameen.|$|E

40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{factors associated}} with rapid promotion rates among elite United States Army officers. It is particularly interested whether officer mobility rates {{are affected by the}} military experience of the officer?s father. Existing studies of <b>military</b> <b>mobility</b> focus primarily on factors dealing with three key areas: military organization, historical situations, and social background. Fathers? prior military service has received relatively little attention. This neglect is unwarranted, as there are studies enough to suggest that a father?s occupation may influence the choices and values of their offspring, which in turn bear on the promotion rates of their sons. This study suggests that among a set of elite officers, those who had a father with a history of military service are promoted to elite level more quickly than those without a father who served. To assess this hypothesis, Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) software developed by Charles Ragin in 1987 is used. QCA allows us to identify what factors are most important among a set of elite Army officers who were most quickly promoted to general officer rank...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of an object-oriented port simulation (PORTSIM) that addresses <b>military</b> <b>mobility</b> issues will be described, with {{a brief description of}} the tool selection process. This system provides users with (1) a graphical user interface, (2) the ability to simulate military units through a specified port, with each individual cargo item (i. e. piece of equipment) represented, (3) utilization statistics for all port resources e. g. gates, staging areas, berths, inspectors, and material handling equipments, (4) utilization statistics for ships that arrive at the port, and (5) a graphical dynamic animation that allows for identification of bottlenecks and facilitates the playing of what-if scenarios to maximize throughput. Cargo is simulated from the time it arrives at a gate or end ramp to the time it is loaded onto a ship. Animation is directly integrated with the simulation to allow for modifications to the scenario while the simulation is running and to have the new parameters used from that point forward in time. The simulation is flexible and allows for multiple cargo types (breakbulk, container, and roll-on/roll-off) and multiple ship types...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis explores {{the foundation of}} modern Disruption Tolerant Protocols. It introduces a previously unpublished protocol with high probability of delivery called the Geolocation Assisted Predictive Routing (GAPR) Protocol and implements Vector Routing for The ONE Simulator. GAPR and Vector are then combined and implemented as GAPR 2, a new protocol that provides delivery ratio near {{the best in the}} field while incurring a quarter of the overhead. GAPR 2, GAPR, and Vector, along with the most widely referenced DTN routing protocols (Epidemic, MaxProp, and PRoPHETv 2) are extensively simulated and their performance evaluated using three mobility models: the Helsinki scenario, a random mobility model, and a military scenario based on a real-world annual exercise. The custom-built <b>military</b> <b>mobility</b> model uses GIS topographical data and custom GIS overlays to implement a realistic scenario terrain. The performance of each protocol is evaluated. This thesis shows through simulation that DTN networks can be employed to enhance communications capabilities without expensive infrastructure or significant platform upgrades. Further, this thesis shows through large-scale simulations that such a network is capable of operating over hundreds of square kilometers and provides the simulation framework to test future routing protocols or equipment configurations.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} history of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) who gained notoriety in the Second World War by {{conducting}} a new form of covert warfare deep behind enemy lines. The LRDG waged a psychological war; continuously appearing and disappearing, they succeeded in creating a sense that the British were everywhere and yet nowhere. In order to effectively execute these covert operations LRDG soldiers became closely acquainted with the desert, their senses attuned to a battlefield of sand, wind and stars. This paper is a study of military bodies and technologies adapting to perform a novel form of deceptive warfare. Examined from the British military’s perspective it explores how the desert-modified car mingled biology, technology and environment to produce a new form of <b>military</b> <b>mobility</b> which shaped the character and legitimised the use of covert desert warfare. It also reveals how covert warfare was naturalised through a heroic narrative of piracy which inspired the group’s inception, justified its establishment and methods, and framed the soldiers’ own performance and understanding of their actions. Overall, the paper uses mobilities research to expose the processes which legitimise warfare strategies. It also argues that it is only by examining these mobilities that such narratives can be held accountable...|$|E
40|$|The Land Information System (LIS; [URL] is a {{flexible}} land surface modeling framework {{that has been}} developed {{with the goal of}} integrating satellite-and ground-based observational data products and advanced land surface modeling techniques to produce optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes. As such, LIS represents a step towards the next generation land component of an integrated Earth system model. In recognition of LIS object-oriented software design, use and impact in the land surface and hydrometeorological modeling community, the LIS software was selected as a co-winner of NASA?s 2005 Software of the Year award. LIS facilitates the integration of observations from Earth-observing systems and predictions and forecasts from Earth System and Earth science models into the decision-making processes of partnering agency and national organizations. Due to its flexible software design, LIS can serve both as a Problem Solving Environment (PSE) for hydrologic research to enable accurate global water and energy cycle predictions, and as a Decision Support System (DSS) to generate useful information for application areas including disaster management, water resources management, agricultural management, numerical weather prediction, air quality and <b>military</b> <b>mobility</b> assessment. LIS has e volved from two earlier efforts [...] North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) that focused primarily on improving numerical weather prediction skills by improving the characterization of the land surface conditions. Both of GLDAS and NLDAS now use specific configurations of the LIS software in their current implementations. In addition, LIS was recently transitioned into operations at the US Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) to ultimately replace their Agricultural Meteorology (AGRMET) system, and is also used routinely by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) /Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) for their land data assimilation systems to support weather and climate modeling. LIS not only consolidates the capabilities of these two systems, but also enables a much larger variety of configurations with respect to horizontal spatial resolution, input datasets and choice of land surface model through "plugins". LIS has been coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to support studies of land-atmosphere coupling be enabling ensembles of land surface states to be tested against multiple representations of the atmospheric boundary layer. LIS has also been demonstrated for parameter estimation, who showed that the use of sequential remotely sensed soil moisture products can be used to derive soil hydraulic and texture properties given a sufficient dynamic range in the soil moisture retrievals and accurate precipitation inputs. LIS has also recently been demonstrated for multi-model data assimilation using an Ensemble Kalman Filter for sequential assimilation of soil moisture, snow, and temperature. Ongoing work has demonstrated the value of bias correction as part of the filter, and also that of joint calibration and assimilation. Examples and case studies demonstrating the capabilities and impacts of LIS for hydrometeorological modeling, assimilation and parameter estimation will be presented as advancements towards the next generation of integrated observation and modeling system...|$|E

40|$|The {{mobility}} {{model is}} one of the most important factors in the performance evaluation of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). Traditionally, the random waypoint mobility model has been used to model the node mobility, where the movement of one node is modeled as independent from all others. However, in reality, especially in large scale <b>military</b> scenarios, <b>mobility</b> coherence among nodes is quite common. One typical mobility behavior is group mobility. Thus, to investigate military MANET scenarios, an underlying realistic mobility model is highly desired. In this paper, we propose a “virtual track ” based group mobility model (VT model) which closely approximates the <b>mobility</b> patterns in <b>military</b> MANET scenarios. It models various types of node mobility such as group moving nodes, individually moving nodes as well as static nodes. Moreover, the VT model not only models the group mobility, it also models the dynamics of group mobility such as group merge and split. Simulation experiments show that the choice of mobility model has significant impact on network performance. I...|$|R

The research was funded by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Finland, and carried out in cooperation with the Geological Survey of Finland. The topic is related to the <b>military</b> cross-country <b>mobility</b> analysis and the assessment of its reliability. The main data sources for the mentioned application are the classified soil maps, where no information about the quality is available. Soil is a typical vague phenomenon that cannot be effectively represented by traditional classification methods. Fuzzy concepts, capable to deal with vagueness, have been accepted as appropriate means for more realistic models, representing the imprecision at the same time. The fuzzy membership functions of the model are in this case based on the knowledge of geologists. The expertise includes many factors and the decisions on the uncertainty are not straightforward. Moreover, their knowledge is expressed in linguistic terms, representing the typical behavior. Therefore the fuzzy expert system, capable to handle also the spatial variability of the soil behavior, was implemented and tested on the case area. The knowledge of geologists on soil maps was documented during the con-struction of the system. The generated fuzzy membership functions match the collected expert knowledge, proving the correctness of the method. Further, the suitability of the fuzzy approach to the modeling of soils was demonstrated. Number of pages: 74 Language: Englis...|$|R
