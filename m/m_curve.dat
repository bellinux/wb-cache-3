50|$|The stay in Sasebo, however, {{proved a}} short one for Worcester, because she got {{underway}} on the 30th {{to return to}} Korean waters to resume her fire support and interdiction duties. At 0600 on 1 October, Worcester joined the blockading force off {{the east coast of}} Korea, south of the 41st parallel, ready to render gunfire support for UN troops advancing against North Korean forces. As she patrolled off the coast, Worcester launched her helicopter to conduct antisubmarine and antimine patrols and frequently stationed lookouts in the bows of the ship, their eyes peeled for mines. Periodically, the screening destroyers found and destroyed mines drifting nearby. Recent encounters with the horned spheres had resulted in all operations being carried on at the 100 fathom (180 <b>m)</b> <b>curve,</b> which meant maximum gun range for the ships if call-fire was required.|$|E
50|$|The Arendal Line was {{converted}} to standard gauge in 1935, {{and became the}} end of the Sørland Line from 9 November. This caused a break-of-gauge at Rise, causing transshipment of all passengers and freight. Work to convert the Grimstad Line started on 24 September 1935, with an average 22 people working with the project. The right-of-way had to be changed at the northern section before the bridge across Nidelva, giving the line a 128 <b>m</b> <b>curve</b> radius. The roundhouse at Grimstad was also moved. During ten hours on 8 November 1936, the 24 switches were replaced, and the following day operations resumed, with standard gauge trains. To being with, a steam locomotive was stationed at Grimstad, but in 1938 it was replaced with a multiple unit. The line was transferred from Arendal District to Kristiansand District when the Sørland Line was opened to Kristiansand from 21 June 1938.|$|E

50|$|The {{first was}} a six-axle {{articulated}} tram from Kassel, Germany, with 80% low floor. The company disliked the lack of air suspension and a door construction where the doors went outwards.

50|$|Due to {{the cost}} of land purchases, the Met's eastward {{extension}} from Moorgate Street was slow to progress and it had to obtain an extension of the Act's time limit in 1869. The extension was begun in 1873, but after construction exposed burials in the vault of a Roman Catholic chapel, the contractor reported that it was difficult to keep the men at work. The first section opened to the Great Eastern Railway's (GER's) recently opened terminus at Liverpool Street on 1 February 1875. For a short time, while the Met's station was being built, services ran into the GER station via a 3.5 chain <b>m</b> <b>curve,</b> the Met opening its station later that year on 12 July and this curve not being used again by regular traffic.

Tirante during the first war patrol of that vessel against enemy Japanese surface forces in the harbor of Cheju, Quelpart Island, off the coast of Korea, on 14 April 1945. With the crew at surface battle stations, Comdr. (then Lt. Comdr.) Street approached the hostile anchorage from the south within 1,200 yards m of the coast to complete a reconnoitering circuit of the island. Leaving the 10-fathom <b>m</b> <b>curve</b> far behind he penetrated the mined and shoal-obstructed waters of the restricted harbor despite numerous patrolling vessels and in defiance of 5 shore-based radar stations and menacing aircraft. Prepared to fight it out on the surface if attacked, Comdr. Street went into action, sending 2 torpedoes with deadly accuracy into a large Japanese ammunition ship and exploding the target in a mountainous and blinding glare of white flames. With the Tirante instantly spotted by the enemy as she stood out plainly in the flare of light, he ordered the torpedo data computer set up while retiring and fired his last 2 torpedoes to disintegrate in quick succession the leading frigate and a similar flanking vessel. Clearing the gutted harbor at emergency full speed ahead, he slipped undetected along the shoreline, diving deep as a pursuing patrol dropped a pattern of depth charges at the point of submergence. His illustrious record of combat achievement during the first war patrol of the Tirante characterizes Comdr. Street as a daring and skilled leader and reflects the highest credit upon himself, his valiant command, and the U.S. Naval Service.|$|E

We show that, for any generic smooth (resp.

C M) lift to the representation space near t 0. (C M denotes the Denjoy–Carleman class associated with M = (Mk), which is always assumed to be logarithmically convex and derivation closed). As an application we prove that any generic smooth curve in V /G admits locally absolutely continuous (not better!) lifts. Assume that G is finite.

40|$|The {{change in}} {{magnetostriction}} Δλ with change in magnetization ΔM for domain‐wall motion {{is shown to}} depend only on the wall type, the magnetostriction constants, and the saturation magnetization {{and not on the}} field required to effect the change.
