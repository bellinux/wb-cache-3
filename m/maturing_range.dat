40|$|ABSTRACT: Study One - Our {{objective}} was to characterize <b>mature</b> <b>range</b> cows based on intake and grazing activity. Starting {{in the early spring}} of 2013, 4 experiments were conducted. First, <b>mature</b> <b>range</b> cows (n = 137) were fitted with radio frequency identification tags (RFID) and placed in a dry-lot pen equipped with GrowSafe® technology to monitor DMI of alfalfa hay. These data were then used to assign cows a residual feed intake (RFI) value utilizing the National Research Council (NRC) (1996) model to predict intake of beef cattle. Cattle with negative and positive RFI were characterized as low-intake and high-intake, respectively. In addition, the following data were also recorded: weight (kg), age (mo), days pregnant (d), and body condition score (BCS). Second, 30 <b>mature</b> <b>range</b> cattle were selected from the first trial and fitted with pedometers for 7 d to monitor activity with step counts and estimate distance traveled. Third, <b>mature</b> <b>range</b> cows (n = 25) selected from the first trial were fitted with global position system (GPS) collars, and placed on pinyon-juniper rangeland from 20 June 2014 to 17 September 2014. Forth, <b>mature</b> <b>range</b> cows (n = 28) were fitted with GPS collars, and placed on ponderosa pine rangeland from 17 September 2014 to 15 October 2014. Distance traveled, slope, distance from water, elevation data were collected from both GPS trials. Low-intake and high-intake cows consumed 9. 3 and 12. 2 kg/d, respectively (P 0. 06). Step counts for low- and high-intake animals were 5839 and 5383 ± 2089, respectively (P = 0. 61), and estimated distance traveled was 4. 31 and 5. 35 ± 1. 66 km d⁻¹ for low- and high-intake animals, respectively (P = 0. 77). Low-intake cows (6. 23 km d⁻¹) traveled farther (P = 0. 005) each day than high-intake cows (5. 84 km d⁻¹) on pinyon-juniper rangelands, and high-intake cows utilized (P = 0. 013) steeper slopes. No differences were detected (P ≥ 0. 06) for distance traveled, distance from water, and elevation for cows grazing ponderosa pine rangeland). However, low-intake cattle preferred (P = 0. 046) steeper slopes on ponderosa pine rangeland than high-intake cattle. These results indicate that low-intake animals may travel farther on some rangelands and rebreed earlier. Study Two - Commercial grade heifers (n = 173) born and raised on the University of Arizona's V bar V Ranch from 2012 to 2014 were fitted with radio frequency identification tags (RFID) and placed in a drylot equipped with Growsafe® technology (8 bunks) for 60 d in 3 groups based on birth year in order to calculate DMI, residual feed intake (RFI), ADG, G:F, and residual gain (RG). Birth date, birth weight, weaning weight, age at start of trial, initial trial weight, and final trial weights were also recorded. Residual feed intake scores were utilized to place heifers in one of three treatment groups, low-, medium-, and high-intake. Reproductive and calf data were collected on heifers born in 2012. Means for birth date, birth weight, weaning weight, initial weight, final weight, and ADG did not differ among the three treatments. Residual gain for low-, medium-, and high-intake heifers were different (P 0. 05), respectively. Differences (P 0. 05). Study Three - Commercially available GPS tracking collars for cattle are cost prohibitive to most researchers. This paper will present a low-cost alternative to those collars (Knight GPS tracking collars), and provide detailed instructions on where to source materials and how to fabricate inexpensive GPS tracking collars. In addition, the two types of collars will be compared in a study where Brangus cattle (n = 8) were each fitted with LOTEK® 3300 and Knight GPS tracking collars for 31 d beginning 14 March 2015 at the Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) 37 km north of Las Cruces, New Mexico. Location, slope, distance from water, distance traveled and elevation were recorded every 10 min. A record of GPS fix rate was logged. No differences were detected (P≥ 0. 369) between collar types for location, slope, or distance from water. However, there was a tendency (P = 0. 08) for Knight collars to report a lower estimate for distance traveled at 6171 m d⁻¹ compared to Lotek collars at 7104 m d⁻¹. Fix rate was greater (P≤ 0. 001) for Lotek collars compared to Knight collars at 99. 9 and 66. 2 %, respectively. Study Four - Previously characterized commercial cows (n = 26) were placed into either high (positive RFI) or low intake (negative RFI) groups. On 14 May 2015, 13 high- and 13 low-intake cows were fitted with modified igotU GT- 120 ® GPS logging collars. Cattle were then placed on rangeland for 120 d. The first 30 d period animals transitioned from desert shrubland to pinyon-juniper. From 31 to 60 d, animals grazed pinyon-juniper rangeland. Next, during days 61 to 90, animals transitioned from pinyon-juniper to ponderosa pine, and the last 30 d were spent in ponderosa pine. Time periods will be referred to as month 1, 2, 3, and 4 for days 0 to 30, 31 to 60, 61 to 90, and 91 to 120, respectively. Location, slope, distance from water, elevation, and time spent close to water were recorded every 10 min. No differences were observed in the utilization of elevation or distance traveled, or distance from water (P> 0. 05). Low intake animals used a higher maximum slope (P 0. 05). Study Five - Hereford sires (n = 35) with 7 or more cow offspring on the University of Arizona V bar V ranch in Rimrock, Arizona were tested at Neogen laboratories in Lincoln, NE for an Igenity Gold genetic profile. Their residual feed intake (RFI), ADG, tenderness, marbling score, milk production percent choice, yield grade, fat thickness, ribeye area, heifer pregnancy rate, stayability, maternal calving ease, birthweight and docility were estimated. Sires were given a genetic RFI score based on their RFI profile and placed into one of three intake groups, low (0. 5 SD). Performance traits of cow offspring (n = 839) from those sires were also compared based on their sire's intake group. No differences (P > 0. 05) were detected among sire intake groups for ADG, tenderness, marbling score, percent choice, yield grade, fat thickness, ribeye area, heifer pregnancy rate, stayability, maternal calving ease, birthweight and docility. Residual feed intake differed among groups (P < 0. 05), and high intake cattle had more estimated milk production compared to low intake animals (P < 0. 05). Cows from low intake sires were born later in the year (P < 0. 05). High intake cattle had a higher (P < 0. 05) birthweight and survived longer (P < 0. 05) in the herd when compared to low and medium intake cows. Genetic RFI and expected milk production were moderately to highly correlated...|$|R

40|$|Australia has a <b>mature</b> <b>range</b> of health, {{welfare and}} {{education}} programs, collectively {{referred to as}} a social purpose market. These services are provided in an increasingly complex, mixed market where governments (the Commonwealth, states and territories, and local government) contribute significant expenditure, with supplementary expenditure from the for-profit, not-for-profit (NFP) and philanthropic organisations, and individual citizens. Within the social purpose market, services are delivered by all levels of government, NFPs and the private sector. Every year Australia spends more than half a trillion dollars (in excess of $ 510 billion) on these social purposes – which is almost one third (32 per cent) of Australia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The significant social and economic challenges associated with Australia’s ageing population mean this figure is projected to increase. Efforts to improve outcomes for Australia’s social purpose services are often designed to address individual segments within the market, and often underestimate the changing roles of governments, the NFP sector, the for-profit sector, and consumers.

40|$|Age, {{growth and}} {{maturation}} of Loligo vulgaris were studied by examination of growth increments within statoliths of 294 specimens (mantle length, ML, ranging from 31 to 498 mm) {{caught on the}} west Saharan shelf between 1985 and 1988. Maximum age was 335 d (290 mm ML) for females, and 396 d (498 mm ML) for males. Growth rates varied considerably among individuals with a greater range in males. Sexual dimorphism in length was apparent after about 210 d. Males and females diverged considerably in weight, with males reaching a greater weight after about 180 d. Growth in length between 124 and 396 d was best described by a power function, while growth in weight was best described by the Gompertz function. Males started maturing at 180 – 210 d and <b>mature</b> males <b>ranged</b> in age between 250 and 396 d; while females started maturing at 240 – 270 d and <b>mature</b> females <b>ranged</b> between 285 and 335 d.

40|$|One of the {{key issues}} in compost {{research}} is to assess when the compost has reached a mature stage. The maturity status of the compost determines {{the quality of the}} final soil amendment product. The nematode community occurring in a Controlled Microbial Composting (CMC) process was analyzed with the objective of assessing whether the species composition {{could be used as a}} bio-indicator of the compost maturity status. The results obtained here describe the major shifts in species composition that occur during the composting process. Compared to terrestrial ecosystems, nematode succession in compost differs mainly in the absence of K-strategists and numerical importance of diplogastrids. At the beginning of the composting process (thermophilic phase), immediately after the heat peak, the nematode population is primarily built by bacterial feeding enrichment opportunists (cp- 1) (Rhabditidae, Panagrolaimidae, Diplogastridae) followed by the bacterial-feeding general opportunists (cp- 2) (Cephalobidae) and the fungal-feeding general opportunists (Aphelenchoididae). Thereafter, during the cooling and maturation stage, the bacterial-feeding-predator opportunistic nematodes (Mononchoides sp.) became dominant. Finally, at the most mature stage, the fungal-feeding Anguinidae (mainly Ditylenchus filimus) were most present. Both, the Maturity Index (MI) and the fungivorous/bacterivorous ratio (f/b ratio), increase as the compost becomes more <b>mature</b> (<b>ranging,</b> respectively, from 1 to 1. 86 and from 0 to 11. 90).
