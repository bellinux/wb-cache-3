When she first moved by herself to upstate New York as a teenager, Miyagawa said she had difficulty making friends at school and assimilating into American culture. She stated that {{at the beginning of}} her life in America, “For years to come, I would cut <b>myself</b> <b>off</b> from Japan. My language skills deteriorated...I had no contact with its culture”. Now, she describes her identity as a “hybrid of acquired American beliefs and imagined Japanese sentiments”. She became a U.S citizen in 1993.|$|E

I was only hinting early on, but then I tell it like it is. It's like, now that I have your attention, I have a few things to tell you." ...|$|E
500|$|... "After a while I {{got sick}} of wearing tons of jewelry—I wanted to clean <b>myself</b> <b>off.</b> I see my new look as very {{innocent}} and feminine and unadorned. It {{makes me feel}} good. Growing up, I admired the kind of beautiful glamorous woman—from Brigitte Bardot to Grace Kelly—who doesn't seem to be around much anymore. I think it's time {{for that kind of}} glamor to come back. In pop music generally, people have one image. You get pigeonholed. I'm lucky {{enough to be able to}} change and still be accepted. If you think about it, that's what they do in the movies; play a part, change characters, looks and attitudes. I guess I do it to entertain myself." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1997, the British media {{reported}} that she was anorexic, labelling her [...] "Kylie Thinogue". Minogue had been told about the rumours and, as a response, wrote the track [...] "Did It Again". Interviewed by Company magazine that year, she was questioned on her weight and the song, and she explained [...] "It's {{a bit of a}} girl's song, with me telling <b>myself</b> <b>off</b> and never learning my lesson, particularly with men. It's me looking myself in the eye and saying 'You fool, stop being too clever and over-neurotic.'" [...] She had begun writing the song whilst British tabloids published rumors about her private life, and the poor reception that Impossible Princess lead single [...] "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] received. However, she re-wrote the original lyrics with Anderson and Seaman and Minogue said it told a [...] "different meaning". The song discusses telling herself off when she does not learn from her past mistakes. She commented that [...] "Some of the songs from Impossible Princess are close to the heart, but this song was a little voice on my shoulder." [...] The song was originally titled [...] "Clever Girl (Did It Again)".|$|E

Having to choose from clubs divided by class, race and skin-tone, James writes of his recruitment as a dark-skinned university-educated player to Maple, a club of the light-skinned lower middle class. He writes, in a chapter entitled [...] "The Light and the Dark": [...] "...faced with the fundamental divisions in the island, I had gone to the right and, by cutting <b>myself</b> <b>off</b> from the popular side, delayed my political development for years." ...|$|E

For high school, Vanunu attended Yeshivat Ohel Shlomo high school, a Bnei Akiva-run school, where he was an honor student. According to Vanunu, whilst in secondary school, he had a personal crisis which led to him deciding to leave Judaism. In an interview, he said that [...] "already at this stage, I decided to cut <b>myself</b> <b>off</b> from the Jewish religion, but I didn't {{want to have a}} confrontation with my parents because I wanted to complete my studies".|$|E
2500|$|On April 28, 1932, Bow {{signed a}} two-picture deal with Fox Film Corporation, for Call Her Savage (1932) and Hoop-La (1933). Both were successful; Variety favored the latter. The October 1934, Family Circle Film Guide rated {{the film as}} [...] "pretty good entertainment", and of Miss Bow said: [...] "This is the most {{acceptable}} bit of talkie acting Miss Bow has done." [...] However, they noted, [...] "Miss Bow is presented in her dancing duds as often as possible, and her dancing duds wouldn't weigh two pounds soaking wet." [...] Bow commented on her revealing costume in Hoop-La: [...] "Rex accused me of enjoying showing <b>myself</b> <b>off.</b> Then I got a little sore. He knew darn well I was doing it because we {{could use a little}} money these days. Who can't?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Paglia's Sexual Personae was {{rejected}} by at least seven different publishers before it was published by Yale University Press, whereupon it became a best seller, reaching seventh place on the paperback best-seller list, a rare accomplishment for a scholarly book. 'Paglia called it her [...] "prison book", commenting, [...] "I felt like Cervantes, Genet. It took all the resources of being Catholic to cut <b>myself</b> <b>off</b> and sit in my cell." [...] Sexual Personae has been called an [...] "energetic, Freud-friendly reading of Western art", one that seemed [...] "heretical and perverse", {{at the height of}} political correctness; according to Daniel Nester, its characterization of [...] "William Blake as the British Marquis de Sade or Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson as 'self-ruling hermaphrodites who cannot mate' still pricks up many an English major's ears".|$|E

2500|$|Orwell was {{an atheist}} who {{identified}} {{himself with the}} humanist outlook on life. Despite this, and despite his criticisms of both religious doctrine and of religious organisations, he nevertheless regularly participated {{in the social and}} civic life of the church, including by attending Church of England Holy Communion. Acknowledging this contradiction, he once said: [...] "It seems rather mean to go to HC [...] when one doesn't believe, but I have passed <b>myself</b> <b>off</b> for pious & there is nothing for it but {{to keep up with the}} deception." [...] Orwell was also extremely well-read in Biblical literature and could quote lengthy passages from the Book of Common Prayer from memory. His extensive knowledge of the Bible came coupled with unsparing criticism of its philosophy, and as an adult he could not bring himself to believe in its tenets. He said in part V of his essay, [...] "Such, Such Were the Joys", that [...] "Till about the age of fourteen I believed in God, and believed that the accounts given of him were true. But I was well aware that I did not love him." [...] Despite this, he had two Anglican marriages and left instructions for an Anglican funeral. Orwell directly contrasted Christianity with secular humanism in his essay [...] "Lear, Tolstoy and the Fool", finding the latter philosophy more palatable and less [...] "self-interested." [...] Literary critic James Wood wrote that in the struggle, as he saw it, between Christianity and humanism, [...] "Orwell was on the humanist side, of course—basically an unmetaphysical, English version of Camus’s philosophy of perpetual godless struggle." ...|$|E
