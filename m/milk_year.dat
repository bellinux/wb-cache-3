Refrigeration systems are used the heaviest in the warmer months for farming produce, which must be cooled {{as soon as possible}} in order to meet quality standards and increase the shelf life.

40|$|Behaviour of {{lactation}} {{length in}} Nili-Ravi buffaloes {{and its relationship}} with other economic traits was studied using 2704 lactations of 993 buffaloes. Lactations shorter than eight weeks {{were not included in}} the data set. About 59 % of the lactations had length shorter than the standard lactation of 10 months. Lactation length averaged 289. 5 days for an average milk yield of 1984 kg. Lactation curves were different for first and later parities with different days in <b>milk.</b> <b>Year</b> effeced (P< 0. 01) lactation length while season did not. Yet, interaction of year and season was significant (P< 0. 01). Age at calving within parity also had an effect (P< 0. 01) with first parity buffaloes having the highest average (280. 4 + 6. 25 days). The trait was 25 % repeatable. Phenotypic trend in the trait was positive, with least squares means for 1970 - 71 (227. 4 + 14. 03 days) and 1996 - 97 (300. 9 + 13. 86 days) being different by about 10 weeks. Further studies should be carried out to find out causes for this positive trend...|$|E
40|$|Milk {{producers}} ' {{responses to}} low expected rates of superlevy and superlevy uncertainty during 1984 / 5 - 1986 / 7 are examined. In England and Wales, the average size of unplanned deviations from quota remained constant over time, whereas the variation amongst {{producers in the}} planned deviation from quota rose more than threefold as producers learned {{to cope with the}} new system. Individual supply decisions appear consistent with the hypothesis of utility maximisation under uncertainty. The extent of over-quota supply is shown to depend on marginal cost, pre-quota expansion trends and size of enterprise, although much variation in supply relative to quota remains unexplained. This paper examines the response of producers to two features of the superlevy system as it was operated during {{the first three years of}} the EC milk quota scheme. Under Formula B, the rate of levy paid by the individual producer on each litre of his over-quota supply was small compared with the punitive rate charged to the dairy on its net excess. Initially, producers did not appear to recognise this. Over time, however, many producers revised their perception of the new policy so that by 1986 / 7 they were taking advantage of the opportunity built into the scheme for supplying over-quota milk at low penalty rates. They did so despite the second feature of the scheme of interest here, namely the uncertainty over the rate of superlevy to be paid. This rate depended on the collective behaviour of all producers in the dairy and was not known until the end of the <b>milk</b> <b>year.</b> In theory, in these conditions, we would expect planned excess supply to be greater for producers with low levy expectations and higher tolerance of risk (Burrell, 1985). * The author wishes to thank the Milk Marketing Board of England and Wales for their sponsorship of this research...|$|E
