5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, or even read one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, but more like free verse. To soften the impact, Aykroyd <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles Yellow Pages directory for when he turned it in to producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Bosanquet {{was one of}} the few bowlers in the MCC team not to {{have some}} success in the opening two matches of the tour, {{although}} he impressed Warner. In addition, he scored 79 runs with the bat in the second game. The third match of the tour was against New South Wales; Bosanquet took four for 60, and his googly caused many problems, particularly for Australia's opening batsman Reggie Duff. He continuously defeated the batsmen, maintaining his length effectively through the innings. By this stage of the tour, Warner believed that Bosanquet was potentially the best bowler in a strong attack if he could bowl a good length, particularly on hard, fast pitches which normally would favour the batsmen. However, Bosnaquet's bowling form remained erratic; in a minor match against a weak side, the opposing captain <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about his team's bowling being no worse than Bosanquet's.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 2009, Tonight Show host Conan O'Brien engaged in a satirical on-air and YouTube feud with Booker, with O'Brien jokingly {{insulting}} the City of Newark and Booker responding that he would ban O'Brien from the Newark airport. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for the feud to end during a prepared comedy bit, telling Booker to {{chalk it up to}} a head injury suffered by O'Brien less than two weeks earlier. Booker then appeared on O'Brien's show and assured viewers that the feud was over and that he was actually a big fan of O'Brien, who agreed that every time he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about Newark, he would donate $500 to the City of Newark, and also made a $50,000 donation to the Newark Now charity, which was matched by NBC Universal.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Keller laughed--and, more {{extraordinary}} still, Mr. Keller <b>made</b> <b>a</b> little <b>joke.</b>|$|R
60|$|Silence, intense, sardonic silence had intervened. The three {{looked at}} one another and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> sour <b>joke</b> about Mandas. Then the black-cap turned to me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Willie Turner!' said Elizabeth; 'oh! the apothecary's daughter, Wilhelmina. You {{must have}} heard of Mr. Turner. Rupert has <b>made</b> <b>a</b> {{standing}} <b>joke</b> of him, ever since the scarlet-fever.' ...|$|R
25|$|In 1998 comedian Eddie Izzard <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> {{using the}} same {{misconception}} in his Dress to Kill show.|$|E
25|$|Despite apologising on {{a number}} of platforms, in 2016, MacKenzie <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> in The Sun {{newspaper}} that if it was true that George Osborne (the then Chancellor of the Exchequer) was putting gongs up for sale, he should be made 'Lord MacKenzie of Anfield (Liverpool FC's home stadium).|$|E
25|$|When Schlessinger {{was born}} on 26 March 1945 he was wrapped in a British {{military}} parachute. He was named for his grandfather. After World War II {{the family moved to}} Osijek, where another son, Darko David, was born. Imre Schlessinger once <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> at the expense of Tito and was sentenced to several months in jail.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. When we {{were walking}} in the wood, I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> stupid <b>joke</b> about her.... What does she know about me--do you ever speak of me to her?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right, Miss Sharp. Right, as usual, Miss Sharp. Uncommon pretty company--haw, haw!" [...] and the Captain laughed {{more and}} more, {{thinking}} he had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> good <b>joke.</b>|$|R
60|$|As usual when he <b>made</b> <b>an</b> obscure <b>joke,</b> {{he leaned}} against the desk and {{bellowed}} in a paroxysm of laughter, his hands shaking so that he could hardly open the envelopes.|$|R
25|$|Neeson, who {{nearly always}} {{suppresses}} his Irish accent when acting, agreed {{to play the}} part of Clinch only {{on the condition that}} he could use his Irish accent. Neeson remarked on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that he made this demand because an episode of MacFarlane's Family Guy had previously <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> out of the juxtaposition of Neeson playing a cowboy with an Irish accent.|$|E
25|$|On August 8, 2006, 19 {{days after}} the first American landing, the PRT was {{attacked}} for the first time. Captain Frank Brooks, commanding at LZ Warheit, was dismayed to discover the PRT could not be quickly supported by LZ Warheit. From the PRTs position, that resembled {{the bottom of a}} funnel, it could not be seen or supported with indirect fire due to the multi-level and complicated local terrain. The tall mountains <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> of two dimensional maps, and rendered pre-determined landmarks useless. Eventually supporting aircraft scattered the attackers, but if the weather had been a problem, air support would not have provided the decisive results.|$|E
25|$|Laurinaitis' son, James Laurinaitis, played linebacker for Ohio State University. As a sophomore, James won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, {{given to}} the best {{defensive}} player in the country, and was {{a finalist for the}} Butkus Award, which is awarded to the best linebacker in the country. In 2007, James won the Butkus Award. In fact, Sports Illustrated <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about borrowing his father's shoulder pads and later did an interview with him that included a picture of him wearing them. He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in the 2nd round as the 35th overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, and played with the Rams through the team's final season in St. Louis in 2015, after which he moved to the New Orleans Saints.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{send it to}} Bob Cratchit's," [...] whispered Scrooge, {{rubbing his}} hands, and {{splitting}} with a laugh. [...] "He shan't know who sends it. It's {{twice the size of}} Tiny Tim. Joe Miller never <b>made</b> such <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> as sending it to Bob's will be!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Joe Miller was {{referred}} to in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol (1843), by the character Scrooge, who remarks [...] "Joe Miller never <b>made</b> such <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> as sending turkey to Bob's will be!" [...] Dickens also references Joe-Millerism in Sketches by Boz, in chapter 1 of The Boarding-house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why Mr. Waterlow. He {{wants to}} keep it near him {{to look at it}} in case he should take a fancy to change it. But I hope he won't change it--it's so lovely as it is!" [...] Francie <b>made</b> <b>a</b> mild <b>joke</b> of saying.|$|R
25|$|Rubin {{tried unsuccessfully}} to provide {{evidence}} of the damaging effect of TV on young minds by issuing subpoenas to actor Telly Savalas, star of Kojak, and to nationally known experts {{on the relationship between}} violence and television. After Zamora was convicted and sentenced to life, he unsuccessfully appealed his sentence, blaming Rubin for the TV intoxication defense which he claimed had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> of his trial. The federal appeals court ruled that evidence against Zamora was overwhelming and that Rubin had made the best of a weak case; the defense had in fact helped Zamora by focusing attention on Zamora's deprived background. Zamora was released from prison in 2004 after having served 27 years in prison. A Costa Rican national, Zamora was repatriated to that country.|$|E
25|$|Osbourne was criticised for her outbursts on the show, where {{before a}} live show in series three she {{reportedly}} {{spoke out against}} Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? presenter Chris Tarrant, {{who was in the}} show's audience prior to filming. Tarrant had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about Ozzy Osbourne to which Sharon Osbourne took offence, but most of her outburst focused on criticising Tarrant's recent infidelity to his wife Ingrid from whom he {{was in the process of}} separating. It was rumoured that Simon Cowell, fellow judge and creator of the show, was displeased with her performance in series three, and was thinking of replacing her and Louis Walsh for the next series. However, it was confirmed that Osbourne had been contracted to return for the fourth series of the show.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{provided}} the entertainment for the 2002 Annual White House correspondents' dinner. Once Carey completed his stand-up routine for the 1,800 guests, President George W. Bush, noting Carey's improv work, <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> of his own: [...] "Drew? Got {{any interest in}} the Middle East?" [...] In 2003, he joined Jamie Kennedy to host the WB's live special Play for a Billion. In September 2003, Carey led a group of comedians, including Blake Clark and The Drew Carey Shows Kathy Kinney, on a comedy tour of Iraq.|$|E
5000|$|McCoy wrote song at {{home while}} smoking hashish. The song was {{originally}} recorded in 1981 as a calypso version titled [...] "Malibu Nightmare". This version was just <b>made</b> as <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> {{but it was}} re-recorded for this album, as a more serious rock song. The song was also released as a single.|$|R
50|$|The {{perception}} of a liberal-leaning bias {{in the mainstream media}} is not a new one. Ronald Reagan <b>made</b> it <b>a</b> running <b>joke</b> during his term in office.|$|R
6000|$|Jennie, intrepid driver herself, {{clutched}} her brother's arm at times, {{as the vehicle}} lurched, but Curtis <b>made</b> it all <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> by shouting, [...] "It is always easy to slide into Hades--the worst is soon over." ...|$|R
500|$|Before {{beginning}} part I of the lecture, Pausch {{explained his}} story of having pancreatic cancer and only having 3 to 6 months to live, but still <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> {{of it by}} {{saying that he was}} still in the best shape of his life (and [...] "better than most of you [...] "), proceeding to do a series of push-ups on stage while still speaking. Pausch also talked about what he would not cover in the lecture, which included his family and children, religion, spirituality, and his terminal cancer or any other cancer.|$|E
500|$|When Woods first {{joined the}} PGA Tour in 1996, his long drives {{had a large}} impact on the world of golf. However, {{when he did not}} upgrade his {{equipment}} in the following years (insisting upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel-shafted clubs and smaller steel clubheads that promoted accuracy over distance), many opponents caught up to him. Phil Mickelson even <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> in 2003 about Woods using [...] "inferior equipment", which did not sit well with Nike, Titleist or Woods. During 2004, Woods finally upgraded his driver technology to a larger clubhead and graphite shaft, which, coupled with his clubhead speed, {{made him one of the}} Tour's lengthiest players off the tee once again.|$|E
500|$|Mikoyan spearheaded {{a project}} to produce a home cookbook, which would {{encourage}} {{a return to the}} domestic kitchen. The result, The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food ( [...] , Kniga o vkusnoi i zdorovoi pishche), was published in 1939, and the 1952 edition sold 2.5 million copies. Mikoyan helped initiate the production of ice cream in the USSR and kept the quality of ice cream under his own personal control until he was dismissed. Stalin <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about this, stating, [...] "You, Anastas, care more about ice cream, than about communism." [...] Mikoyan also contributed to the development of meat production in the USSR (particularly, the so-called Mikoyan cutlet), and one of the Soviet-era sausage factories was named after him.|$|E
50|$|When Ted Turner <b>made</b> <b>a</b> demeaning <b>joke</b> about Poles in a Washington speech, Sikorski {{demanded an}} apology and Turner complied. Sikorski's appeal to Polish {{nationals}} with dual citizenship {{to use the}} passport of the country they were visiting caused some controversy among the Polish expatriate community, but has now become an established practice.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1964 Carmichael <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joking</b> remark in {{response}} to a SNCC position paper written by his friends Casey Hayden and Mary E. King on the position of women in the movement. In the course of an irreverent comedy monologue he performed at a party after SNCC's Waveland conference, Carmichael said, [...] "The position of women in the movement is prone." [...] A number of women were offended. In a 2006 The Chronicle of Higher Education article, historian Peniel E. Joseph later wrote: While the remark was made in jest during a 1964 conference, Carmichael and black-power activists did embrace an aggressive vision of manhood — one centered on black men's ability to deploy authority, punishment, and power. In that, they generally reflected their wider society's blinders about women and politics.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope it is}} to be regained on easier terms," [...] said Charles; {{and then}} to ease the {{situation}} which began to irk him by its solemnity, he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> feeble <b>joke.</b> [...] "It is merely asked of you that you refrain from going through certain fires that are not accounted by mademoiselle of too purifying a nature." ...|$|R
500|$|When it was {{revealed}} that the Earl and the other Noah were living in the Kamelot family as a normal humans, the author <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> regarding the Earl was not suffering metabolic syndrome based on how much sugar he added to his coffee. Hoshino had already designed the Earl's human form before the manga began serialization. She found his [...] "tired" [...] human form as the series' main antagonist appropriate for the series' readership and one of its themes: grief. He was modelled on the Jump J-books editorial department, and her tastes were reflected in him. Although many readers considered the Earl obese, Hoshino laughingly maintained that he was not; however, his plumpness was important to the future plot.|$|E
500|$|Following Kurt Cobain's {{suicide in}} 1994, public and media {{interest}} in Love heightened, and her erratic onstage behavior and suspected drug problems during Hole's 1994–1995 world tour significantly exacerbated the media's critical observations of her. On July 4, 1995, at the Lollapalooza Festival in George, Washington, she punched musician Kathleen Hanna {{in the face}} after alleging she had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> about her daughter. Love was charged with assault, to which she pleaded guilty, {{and was sentenced to}} anger management classes. [...] In 1995, she was arrested in Melbourne for disrupting a Qantas Airways flight after getting into an argument with a stewardess. In a retrospective interview, Love stated that she could [...] "not remember much" [...] from the band's 1994–1995 tour, noting that she had been using both heroin and Rohypnol heavily at the time.|$|E
500|$|Germain and Klasky {{initially}} {{planned to}} portray the character as divorced, but Nickelodeon executives rejected the idea, feeling that the subject would be inappropriate for younger viewers. The studio also vetoed a reveal that the mother was dead, contending that such an idea would be [...] "scary" [...] and that [...] "children [...] want to see that." [...] Germain stated this prevented them from saying much about the character in earlier seasons, adding: [...] "We mention that she exists but we don't {{tell you what happened}} to her. We even <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> out of it in one episode. But we weren't allowed to go into the subject." [...] Even when the show did portray Chuckie's mother as having died from a terminal illness, the word [...] "dead" [...] was never used by any of the characters. The character had been briefly mentioned before in the episodes [...] "Real or Robots?" [...] (1991), [...] "Chuckie vs. the Potty" [...] (1992), and [...] "My Friend Barney" [...] (1993).|$|E
500|$|In 2011, the BBC apologised after Grant <b>made</b> <b>an</b> offhand <b>joke</b> about {{homosexuality}} and rugby {{when he was}} invited into the commentary box during coverage of an England vs Scotland game at Twickenham Stadium. Talking about playing rugby during his school days, Grant said: [...] "I discovered it hurt less if you tackled hard than if you tackled like a queen." ...|$|R
50|$|The casting {{director}} {{said she was}} not necessarily the best actor, but {{would be the best}} one for the commercial. The contestants' parents surprised their daughters by making a visit. Hana's boyfriend <b>made</b> <b>a</b> bad <b>joke</b> by pretending not to come but then arriving later on. Hana was not amused unlike her boyfriend who laughed a lot and apparently enjoyed having teased her.|$|R
