40|$|Microelectronic {{systems are}} <b>multi-material,</b> <b>multi-layer</b> structures, {{fabricated}} and exposed to environmental stresses {{over a wide}} range of temperatures. Thermal and residual stresses created by thermal mismatches in films and interconnections are a major cause of failure in microelectronic devices. Due to new device materials, increasing die size and the introduction of new materials for enhanced thermal management, differences in thermal expansions of various packaging materials have become exceedingly important and can no longer be neglected. X-ray diffraction is an analytical method using a monochromatic characteristic X-ray beam to characterize the crystal structure of various materials, by measuring the distances between planes in atomic crystalline lattice structures. As a material is strained, this interplanar spacing is correspondingly altered, and this microscopic strain is used to determine the macroscopic strain. This thesis investigates and describes the theory and implementation of X-ray diffraction in the measurement of residual thermal strains. The design of a computer controlled stress attachment stage fully compatible with an Anton Paar heat stage will be detailed. The stress determined by the diffraction method will be compared with bimetallic strip theory and finite element models...|$|E
40|$|Ceramic tiles are {{the main}} {{ingredient}} of a <b>multi-material,</b> <b>multi-layered</b> composite being considered for the modernization of tank armors. The high stiffness, low attenuation, and precise dimensions of these uniform tiles make them remarkable resonators when driven to vibrate. Defects in the tile, during manufacture or after usage, are expected to change the resonance frequencies and resonance images of the tile. The comparison of the resonance frequencies and resonance images of a pristine tile/lay-up to a defective tile/lay-up will thus be a quantitative damage metric. By examining the vibrational behavior of these tiles and the composite lay-up with Finite Element Modeling and analytical plate vibration equations, {{the development of a}} new Nondestructive Evaluation technique is possible. This study examines the development of the Air-Coupled Ultrasonic Resonance Imaging technique as applied to a hexagonal ceramic tile and a <b>multi-material,</b> <b>multi-layered</b> composite...|$|R

The criteria for remelting the solid substrate are derived from a one dimensional heat transfer model. Temperature gradients which occur during solidification and subsequent cooling {{are responsible for the}} build up of internal stresses which can be estimated through establishing an elastic beam model.

40|$|International audienceThe {{materials}} used {{in the field of}} ground transportation are becoming increasingly complex and it is usual to find numerous composite parts. The potential for utilization is generally verified through the numerical simulations, especially due to the increase in severe safety criteria. This paper deals with a finite element intended to describe numerically the behaviour of <b>multi-layered</b> <b>multi-materials</b> (combination of metallic and composite plies). A complete description of this element is presented with the taking into account of the resin ductility and the asymmetrical tension/compression behaviour for composite plies. The latter are performed by the introduction of an isotropic hardening law and a compressive multiplier depending on strain. Some numerical validations will be produced to verify the developments...|$|R
40|$|Ceramic tiles are {{the main}} {{ingredient}} of a <b>multi‐layer</b> <b>multi‐material</b> composite being considered for the modernization of tank armors. The high stiffness, low attenuation, and precise dimensions of these uniform tiles make them remarkable resonators when driven to vibrate. This study is aimed at modeling the vibration modes of the tiles and the composite lay‐up with finite element analysis and comparing the results with the resonance modes observed in air‐coupled ultrasonic excitation of the tiles and armor samples. Defects in the tile, during manufacturing and∕or after usage, are expected to change the resonance modes. The comparison of a pristine tile∕lay‐up and a defective tile∕lay‐up will thus be a quantitative damage metric. The understanding of the vibration behavior of the tile, both by itself and in the composite lay‐up, can provide useful guidance to the nondestructive evaluation of armor panels containing ceramic tiles...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} simulation {{procedure is}} described for the coupled response of <b>multi-layered</b> <b>multi-material</b> composite engine structural components which {{are subjected to}} simultaneous multi-disciplinary thermal, structural, vibration, and acoustic loadings including the effect of hostile environments. The simulation {{is based on a}} three dimensional finite element analysis technique in conjunction with structural mechanics codes and with acoustic analysis methods. The composite material behavior is assessed at the various composite scales, i. e., the laminate/ply/constituents (fiber/matrix), via a nonlinear material characterization model. Sample cases exhibiting nonlinear geometrical, material, loading, and environmental behavior of aircraft engine fan blades, are presented. Results for deformed shape, vibration frequency, mode shapes, and acoustic noise emitted from the fan blade, are discussed for their coupled effect in hot and humid environments. Results such as acoustic noise for coupled composite-mechanics/heat transfer/structural/vibration/acoustic analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of coupled multi-disciplinary computational simulation and the various advantages of composite materials compared to metals...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the least}} {{understood}} mechanisms of Li-ion batteries {{is the development of}} internal short circuits under mechanical loads. In this study, a micro mechanical model is developed and subjected to various loading scenarios to understand the sequence of failure in the <b>multi-layer,</b> <b>multi-material</b> structure of a Li-ion battery jellyroll. The constitutive response of each component of the electrode stack is obtained by comprehensive experimental tests using uniaxial and biaxial tensile and compressive loads. The homogenized response of the model is recovered through the computational homogenization theory. The model is validated by comparing the results of a macroscale simulation against experimental data. The study focuses next on the development of a failure criterion for the electrode stack based on the microstructural observations. Results show distinct failure mechanisms when the loading is predominantly tensile versus when it is compressive or combined tensile/compressive. A failure locus is plotted from the results of the simulations as a criterion to detect the onset of short circuit under complex multi-axial loading scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{models are}} used {{extensively}} by fire protection engineers for performance based design and forensic analysis. The {{equations of motion}} describing the gas phase are relatively well known and the approximations in the various gas phase sub-models have been extensively studied. However, coupling of the gas phase and the condensed phase to describe flame spread over a burning solid, {{has proven to be}} difficult to model. This is {{due to a lack of}} understanding of the underlying physical phenomena that take place during the decomposition of the solid as well as poor characterization of the fundamental material properties that control the burning process. The overall goal of this project is to improve the capability of the fire models to predict flame spread over materials that typically burn in a compartment fire. In this paper, we attempt to simulate fire growth and spread on 10 cm thick slabs of polyurethane foam. A <b>multi-layered,</b> <b>multi-material</b> model was developed to simulate flame spread, and material properties were obtained from various small scale experiments. Model predictions were compared with large scale experiments on polyurethane foam slabs, ignited on one edge. Results indicate that the model is capable of qualitatively predicting the observed trends in heat release rate, flame spread rate and heat fluxes measured in the experiments. This report will describe the progress that has been made to date on modeling fire growth and spread on polyurethane foam slabs and the comparison of these results with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to develop a}} methodology for predicting the high strain rate properties of macro scale polymer composite materials through micro and meso scale finite element modelling. The focus in this study was on <b>multi-layered</b> <b>multi-material</b> polymer composite laminates consisting of 0 / 90 and ± 45 layers of either; 52 Glass/Epoxy or Carbon/Epoxy non crimp fabric. A multi-scale finite element modelling methodology was developed at the micro and meso scale for predicting the elastic response, damage in itiation, damage evolution and strain rate dependence of macro scale polymer composite materials. The methodology was implemented in the Abaqus finite element package utilising Python scripting for simulation definition and Fortran code for user defined explicit material subroutines. Micro scale unit cells were tested in longitudinal, transverse and shear loa. ding directions over a range of strain rates. The results of the micro scale testing were converted into material properties of the meso scale yarns / tows. Meso scale unit cells were tested in in-plane, through thickness and shear loading directions over of a range of strain rates. The results of the meso scale testing were converted into material properties of macro scale polymer composite materials. The modelling methodology was validated against experimental testing conducted on meso scale samples over a range of strain rates using an electromechanical universal static test machine and an instrumented falling weight drop tower. The contribution to knowledge from this study is the development of a validated modelling methodology for predicting the elastic, damage and strain rate dependent response of polymer composite materials at a micro and meso scale. ivEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Artists have {{experimented with}} a variety of organic natural {{materials}} for use as paint binders and varnishes, and as ingredients for mordants in gildings. Often artists used many layers of paint to produce particular effects. How we see a painting is thus the final result of how this complex, highly heterogeneous, <b>multi-material</b> and a <b>multi-layered</b> structure interacts with light. The chemical characterisation of organic paint materials in works of art is of great interest in terms of conservation. This is because the organic components of the paint layer are particularly subject to degradation. In addition, knowing the organic paint materials allows us to differentiate between the painting techniques that have been used over history. Applying GC/MS analysis to microsamples of paint layers is widely recognised as the best approach for identifying organic materials such as proteins, drying oils, waxes, terpenic resins and polysaccharide gums. This then provides essential information for reconstructing artistic techniques, for assessing the best conditions for long-term preservation, and for planning restoration. This paper summarises the more common approaches adopted in the study of organic paint materials. Our progress in developing GC/MS analytical procedures in the field of the cultural heritage is presented, focusing on problems that arise from the presence of mixtures of many chemically complex and degraded materials, from the interference of inorganic species, from the small size of the samples, and from the risk of contamination. We outline some critical aspects of the analytical strategy, such as the need to optimise specific wet-chemical sample pre-treatments in order to separate the various components, to hydrolyse macromolecular analytes, to clean up inorganic ions, and to derivatise polar molecules for subsequent GC/MS separation and identification. We also discuss how to interpret the chromatographic data so as to be able to identify the materials. This identification is based on the presence of specific biomarkers (chemotaxonomy), on the evaluation of the overall chromatographic profile, or on the quantitative analysis of significant compounds. Selected examples and case studies relating to paintings from various ages and origins are given...|$|R
40|$|In cricket, {{high speed}} impacts occur between the cricket {{ball and the}} bat, player and their {{protective}} equipment. Improved understanding of impact dynamics {{has the potential to}} significantly improve the development of cricket equipment and also contribute to improving the player’s safety and performance. In particular, development of high performance cricket balls with enhanced structural properties (e. g. improved durability) would benefit greatly from such insight. In order to gain more insight into the impact dynamics of cricket balls, appropriate structural models of the ball are required. This work presents two fast-solving numerical models, a detailed multi-layer FE model as well as a universal FE model, for the structural analysis of cricket balls. The models were derived using experimental data obtained from tests developed for this purpose, including drop tests and high speed impact tests. The experimental work presented in this study included measurements of the impact behaviour of two-layer, three-layer, and five-layer cricket balls using a dynamic signal analyser and high speed video analysis software. The ball properties obtained experimentally were used to develop two mathematical models: a single-element model and a three-element model. These cricket ball models have been developed so that they capture the key characteristics of ball-impact behaviour while allowing for fast-solving dynamic simulation. The stiffness and damping properties of both models were determined using a novel fast-solving genetic algorithm. These models predict the force-time diagram during impact with very little computing cost. However, developing a mathematical model with a reasonable level of accuracy is still a challenge. The simulation of the ball model impact with a flat surface achieved reasonable agreement with experimental results for both the single-element and the three-element models. The genetic algorithm (GA) method proved to be more efficient and convenient than directly solving the differential equations. A detailed <b>multi-layer,</b> <b>multi-material</b> Finite Element (FE) model has also been developed. The model has been experimentally validated and refined to a greater level of detail than has been previously possible. Dynamic explicit analysis was conducted using ABAQUS (ABAQUS Inc., USA). A universal Finite Element (FE) ball model has also been developed within the ABAQUS CAE environment. This model {{can be seen as a}} combination of an FE model template and a material parameter selection tool based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. This approach allows for rapid model development while producing accurate results at different impact speeds. Two sets of real test data obtained from a five-layer cricket ball and a two-layer cricket ball at impact velocity of 25 m/s were used to examine the ANN model. The developed FE-ANN model and the corresponding training process represent an invaluable tool for facilitating design, analysis and structural optimization of cricket-related sport equipment. Furthermore, the application presented here can be extended to simulate any solid ball impact...|$|R
