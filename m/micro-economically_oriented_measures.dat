40|$|This {{study is}} part of a trend of {{examining}} noncognitive predictors, for example, a situational judgment test (SJT), as supplements to cognitive predictors for making college admission decisions. The authors examined criterion data over multiple academic years and universities. The criterion domain was broadly conceptualized, including both cognitive and interpersonal domains. The sample consisted of 7, 197 candidates of the Medical and Dental Studies Admission Exam in Belgium. Results confirmed the importance of cognitive predictors. A video-based SJT was differentially valid for predicting overall grade point average for different curricula. The SJT showed incremental validity over cognitively <b>oriented</b> <b>measures</b> for curricula that included interpersonal courses, but not for other curricula. The SJT became more valid through the years. This demonstrates the importance of carefully specifying predictor–criterion linkages and of differentiating both predictor and criterion constructs. The domains of personnel selection and higher educational admissions share a number of parallels (Sackett, Schmitt, Elling-son, & Kabin, 2001).

40|$|The {{extent to}} which sensory {{impairments}} in the foot, ankle and lower limb persist into the chronic phase of stroke is unclear. Furthermore, the {{extent to which}} these impairments influence walking, balance and falls is not well understood. This thesis investigated the prevalence, functional importance and measurement of lower limb somatosensory impairments in ambulatory people with chronic stroke. Methods This thesis comprised three studies: the first, a qualitative investigation, explored the views and experiences of people with chronic stroke (n= 13). This led to the second study: a cross sectional observational study in which the prevalence, distribution and functional relevance of lower limb sensory impairments were investigated in chronic stroke participants (n= 180) and healthy controls (n= 46). The final study, informed by the findings from the first two studies, a “synthesis” review of current sensory measures and patient and carer involvement, developed and evaluated three novel, functionally <b>oriented</b> <b>measures</b> of lower limb somatosensory discrimination in chronic stroke (n= 32) and healthy controls (n= 32). Results People with stroke felt problems with foot, ankle and lower limb sensation affected their walking, balance and contributed to falls. Furthermore, sensory impairments in the lower limb are prevalent with up to 59 % of chronic stroke survivors having a deficit of one or more somatosensory modality. Despite this, weak associations between traditional measures of tactile and proprioceptive sensation and walking, balance and falls were demonstrated. Novel, functionally <b>oriented</b> <b>measures</b> of tactile and proprioceptive discrimination were developed and evaluated. These measures were reliable and valid, showing greater sensitivity to predicting the presence of sensory impairments and had stronger associations with functional measures than traditional sensory tests. Conclusions This thesis has provided a comprehensive picture of lower limb somatosensory dysfunction in chronic stroke survivors. Sensory impairments persist into the chronic phase of stroke in the majority of stroke survivors. The extent to which such impairments influence functional ability warrants further investigation. The use of functionally <b>oriented</b> <b>measures</b> that assess higher-level somatosensation is encouraged.

It was predicted that firefighters who slept more and reported better quality sleep on average would exhibit lower impulsivity inclinations related to slower life history trajectories. UPPS impulsivity scores and self-reported sleep averages were analyzed and indicated a negative association between sleep variables and urgency and a positive association with premeditation. Perseverance, and in some cases premeditation, however, disclosed an unpredicted marginally significant positive association between increased and emergency nighttime waking-related sleep deprivation. Sensation seeking was not associated with sleep variables, but was strongly associated with number of biological children. This research contributes to understanding the implications of human sleep across ecological and behavioral contexts and implies further research is necessary for constructing evolutionarily <b>oriented</b> <b>measures</b> of impulsivity inclination and its meaning in the context of life history strategies...|$|R
