He also planned that the city's streets would be {{set up in a}} grid, with the idea that the city would be more like the rural towns of England than its crowded cities. The homes would be spread far apart and surrounded by gardens and orchards. The city granted the first purchasers land along the Delaware River for their homes. It had access to the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean, and became an important port in the Thirteen Colonies. He named the city Philadelphia (philos, [...] "love" [...] or [...] "friendship", and adelphos, [...] "brother"); it was to have a commercial center for a <b>market,</b> <b>state</b> house, and other key buildings.|$|E

Contrary to the prior literature, this paper estimates the sample separated from different <b>market</b> <b>states,</b> including bullish, bearish, and range-bound markets, and finds that the affecting patterns of the determinants of initial returns indeed exhibit some significant differences under different <b>market</b> <b>states.</b> For instance, the stronger the auditor reputation effect, the lower are the initial returns under a range-bound market, and the market momentum effect is stronger under a bullish market. In addition, the risk perception effect is stronger under a bearish market.

After studying the <b>market’s</b> <b>states</b> separation using the former, we use the latter to characterize the economic conditions over time and to compute the conditional probabilities of related <b>market</b> <b>states.</b> ...|$|R

This is the first study of the determinants of worker transitions between various labor <b>market</b> <b>states</b> using panel data from Egypt. We first provide a diagnosis of dynamic worker flows across different labor <b>market</b> <b>states.</b> We develop transition probabilities by gender across different labor <b>market</b> <b>states</b> utilizing Markov transition processes. Next we identify the effects of individual, household, job characteristics and location on different mobility patterns by estimating a multinomial logit regression. The results point to the highly static nature of the Egyptian labor market. Government employment and the out of labor force are the most persistent labor <b>market</b> <b>states.</b> Further, {{only a few of the}} explanatory variables except high levels of education are found to have predictive power in explaining the transitions from formal wage, informal wage, self-employment, unemployment government employment and out of labor <b>market</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{provides}} historical, theoretical, {{and empirical}} syntheses {{in understanding the}} rationality of investors, stock prices, and stock market efficiency behaviour in the theoretical lenses of behavioural finance paradigm. The inquiry is guided by multidisciplinary behavioural-related theories. The analyses employed a long span of Bursa Malaysia stock market data from 1977 to 2014 along the different phases of economic development and <b>market</b> <b>states.</b> The tests confirmed the presence of asymmetric dynamic behaviour of prices predictability as well as risk and return relationships across different <b>market</b> <b>states,</b> risk states and quantiles data segments. The efficiency tests show trends of an adaptive pattern of weak market efficiency across various economic phases and <b>market</b> <b>states.</b> Collectively, these evidences lend support to bounded-adaptive rational of investors' behaviour, dynamic stock price behaviour, and accordingly forming bounded-adaptive market efficiency...|$|R
50|$|A {{new society}} of <b>market</b> <b>states</b> is being born. The {{challenges}} facing the society of states today are {{a direct consequence of}} the strategic innovations that won the Long War—the development of nuclear weapons, a global system of communications, and the technology of rapid computation. These have undermined the ability of any nation state to govern its economy; to assert its laws in the face of universal norms of human rights; to defend its territory against weapons of mass destruction; to tackle transnational problems like climate change, epidemics and terrorism; and to protect the national culture from outside influences. <b>Market</b> <b>states</b> will take up these challenges. Though there are, at present, no <b>market</b> <b>states,</b> it is speculated that they will come in at least three fundamentally different forms: mercantile, managerial, and entrepreneurial.|$|R

Also, individual investors trade more in relatively riskier securities following gains than institutional investors.

This paper considers {{the ways in which}} these two labour <b>market</b> <b>states</b> differ for a sample of male and female respondents to the Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia (HILDA) survey. It presents data related to the reasons why respondents in these two labour force states consider they are jobless and analyses the characteristics of male and female respondents in the two labour <b>market</b> <b>states</b> to consider differences in outcomes. The findings suggest that there are differences in the two <b>states</b> of labour <b>market</b> outcomes and that these are further complicated when one considers processes for males and females. 頲 009 Springer Science+Business Media B.

Interestingly, we find that the behaviour of momentum returns in Malaysia is broadly consistent with that in the US market in that momentum returns are higher following UP markets compared with momentum returns following DOWN markets. We also find that momentum returns are larger when the market continues in same state than when it transitions to a different state, consistent with results in the US market and that the absence of momentum returns following DOWN <b>market</b> <b>states</b> is due to market dynamics. Our results suggest that investors in Islamic stocks can execute momentum strategies without loss of efficacy compared with Non-Islamic stocks...|$|R

40|$|Version 1. 01 Historical (Stressed-) Value-at-Risk ((S) VAR), and Expected Short-fall (ES), {{are widely}} used risk {{measures}} in regulatory capital and Initial Margin, i. e. funding, computations. However, whilst the definitions of VAR and ES are unambiguous, they depend on input distributions that are data-cleaning- and Data-Model-dependent. We quantify the scale of these effects from USD CDS (2004 – 2014), and from USD interest rates (1989 – 2014, single-curve setup before 2004, multi-curve setup after 2004), and make two standardisation proposals: for data; and for Data-Models. VAR and ES are required for lifetime portfolio calculations, i. e. collateral calls, which cover {{a wide range of}} <b>market</b> <b>states.</b> Hence we need standard, i. e. clean, complete, and common (i. e. identical for all banks), market data also covering this wide range of <b>market</b> <b>states.</b> This data is histor-ically incomplete and not clean hence data standardization is required. Stressed VAR and ES require moving market movements during a past (usually not recent) window to current, and future, <b>market</b> <b>states.</b> All choices (e. g. absolute difference, relative, relative scaled by some func-tion of <b>market</b> <b>states)</b> implicitly define a Data Model for transformation of extreme market moves (recall that 99 th percentiles are typical, and the behaviour of the rest is irrelevant). Hence we propose standard Data Models. These are necessary because different banks have different stress windows. Where there is no data, or a requirement for simplicity, we propose standard lookup tables (one per window, etc.). Without this standardization of data and Data Models we demonstrate that VAR and ES are complex derivatives of subjective choices...|$|R
