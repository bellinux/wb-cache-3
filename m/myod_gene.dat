50|$|Pitx2 {{plays a role}} in limb myogenesis. Pitx2 can {{determine}} the development and activation of the <b>MyoD</b> <b>gene</b> (the gene responsible for skeletal myogenesis). Studies have shown that expression of Pitx2 happens before MyoD is expressed in muscles. Further studies show that Pitx2 is directly recruited to act on the MyoD core enhancer and thus, directing the expression of the <b>MyoD</b> <b>gene.</b> Pitx 2 is in a parallel pathway with Myf5 and Myf6, as both paths effect expression of MyoD. However, {{in the absence of the}} parallel pathway, Pitx2 can continue activating MyoD genes. The expression of Pitx2 saves <b>MyoD</b> <b>gene</b> expression and keeps expressing this gene for limb myogenesis. Yet, the Pitx 2 pathway is PAX3 dependent and requires this gene to enact limb myogenesis. Studies support this finding as in the absence of PAX3, there is Pitx2 expression deficit and thus, MyoD does not express itself in limb myogenesis. The Pitx2 gene is thus shown to be downstream of Pax3 and serve as an intermediate between Pax3 and MyoD. In conclusion, Pitx2 plays an integral role in limb myogenesis.|$|E

JDP2 functionally associated with HDAC3 and acts as a repressor to inhibit the amino acid regulation of CHOP transcription. JDP2 and ATF3 are involved in recruiting HDACs to the ATF3 promoter region resulting in transcriptional repression of ATF3. JDP2 inhibits the promoter of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immediate early gene BZLF1 for the regulation of the latent-lytic switch in EBV infection.|$|E

MyoD is expressed at extremely low and essentially undetectable levels in quiescent satellite cells, but expression of MyoD is activated in response to exercise or muscle tissue damage. The effect of MyoD on satellite cells is dose-dependent; high MyoD expression represses cell renewal, promotes terminal differentiation and can induce apoptosis. Although MyoD marks myoblast commitment, muscle development is not dramatically ablated in mouse mutants lacking the <b>MyoD</b> <b>gene.</b> This is likely due to functional redundancy from Myf5 and/or Mrf4. Nevertheless, the combination of MyoD and Myf5 is vital to the success of myogenesis.|$|E

The authors investigated here whether the methylation level of LINE- 1 repeats, a surrogate marker for genomic methylation, was associated with the level of CpG island methylation in colorectal cancers and in matching normal colonic mucosa from 178 patients. The MethyLight assay was used to quantitate the methylation of CpG islands within the MLH 1, P 16 (INK 4 A), TIMP 3, DAPK, APC, ER and <b>MYOD</b> <b>genes.</b> A real-time, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assay was also used to quantitate the methylation of LINE- 1 repeats. In colorectal cancer, no associations were seen between methylation levels in LINE- 1 repeats and CpG island loci, including a new CpG island panel that was recently proposed for CIMP+. In normal colonic mucosa, however, the methylation level of LINE- 1 repeats was inversely correlated with CpG-island methylation of the MLH 1, P 16, TIMP 3, APC, ER and <b>MYOD</b> <b>genes.</b> The methylation level of LINE- 1 repeats in normal colonic mucosa also showed significant associations with common polymorphisms in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase and methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase genes involved in methyl group metabolism.

50|$|As stated earlier, the {{combination}} of Myf5 and MyoD {{is crucial to the}} success of myogenesis. Both MyoD and Myf5 are members of the myogenic bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) proteins transcription factor family. Cells that make myogenic bHLH transcription factors (including MyoD or Myf5) are committed to development as a muscle cell. Consequently, the simultaneous deletion of Myf5 and MyoD also results in a complete lack of skeletal muscle formation. Research has shown that MyoD directly activates its own gene; this means that the protein made binds the <b>myoD</b> <b>gene</b> and continues a cycle of MyoD protein production. Meanwhile, Myf5 expression is regulated by Sonic hedgehog, Wnt1, and MyoD itself. By noting the role of MyoD in regulating Myf5, the crucial interconnectedness of the two genetic factors becomes clear.|$|E

Electrical stimulation based on chronaxie could regulate <b>myoD</b> <b>gene</b> expression in denervated muscle fibers. 20 muscle contractions, induced by electrical stimulation using surface electrodes and applied on alternate days based on muscle excitability, similar to protocols used in human clinical rehabilitation, were able to reduce the accumulation of mRNA in the myoD and atrogin-1 of denervated muscles, theseexpressions being related to muscle growth and atrophy, respectively. The increase in myoD levels after denervation is possibly related not only to activation and proliferationof the satellite cells but also to regulation of the cell cycle. Several {{studies have suggested that}} the function of denervation-induced myoD may be to prevent the muscle atrophy induced by denervation.To assess contractility of denervated leg muscles, rheobase and chronaxie were determined inanaesthetized rat by surface electrical stimulation andpalpation of the leg muscles. The valuesof chronaxie of TA muscle measured up to 9-monthafter sciatectomy. Muscle excitability decreased earlyafter denervation. Chronaxie from 0.1-0.2 msin innervated muscle changed to 0.5-1 ms within one to twodays after denervation (i.e., after [...] Walleriandegeneration of the nerve) and progressively increasedto about 20 ms during the following month.Chronaxie remained at this level up to 6 months postsciatectomy(Mid-term denervation stage in the ratmodel: from 2 to 6 months sciatectomy). Afterwards,the twitch contraction became questionably palpableand thus chronaxie increased to much longer values(from 50 ms to infinitum, i.e., the muscle twitch wasnot palpable).

Mammalian heterochromatin protein 1 isoforms HP 1 alpha, HP 1 beta, and HP 1 gamma play {{important roles in}} the regulation of chromatin structure and function. We explored the possibility of different roles for the three HP 1 isoforms in an integrated system, skeletal muscle terminal differentiation. In this system, terminal differentiation is initiated by the transcription factor <b>MyoD,</b> whose target <b>genes</b> remain mainly silent until myoblasts are induced to differentiate. Here we show that HP 1 alpha and HP 1 beta isoforms, but not HP 1 gamma, interact with MyoD in myoblasts. This interaction is direct, as shown using recombinant proteins in vitro.

The early expression of MyoD in Xenopus development suggests that it may play a part in the induction of muscle mesoderm and generally strengthens the evi-dence that MyoD is determinative in muscle commit-ment.

The expression of the reporter lacZ gene was detected from 10. 5 days post coitum in the myotomes, consistent with endogenous myoD mRNA. However, in limb buds and branchial arches, {{the appearance of the}} lacZ-positive cells was delayed for one day compared with the endogenous myoD mRNA, suggesting the existence of a different control mechanism among muscle cell lineages. Further, a subset of cells in the central nervous system (CNS), where endogenous myoD mRNA was not detected, expressed the transgene transiently. The same 6 -kb MyoD-lacZ gene injected into Xenopus embryos was expressed in the myotomes and in CNS cells at the tailbud stage. Deletion analyses in both transgenic mice and Xenopus embryos indicated that the DRR and PRR were together sufficient for the expression pattern in skeletal muscle. In addition, analysis in Xenopus indicated that a third enhancer region between - 1. 3 kb and - 275 bp could substitute for the DRR.

Although both <b>MyoD</b> <b>genes</b> are expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle in adult animals, they have very different temporal patterns of expression in early development. In the present work, we show that XImfl transcripts rapidly accumulated to high levels shortly after activation of the zygotic genome at the midblastula transition.

X 1 mf 25, like XImfl, was capable of converting 1011 / 2 fibroblasts to a myogenic phenotype. In addition, both proteins directly trans-activated reporter genes linked to muscle-specific regulatory elements. XImfl was twice as active in this regard as X 1 mf 25 and required a carboxy-terminal domain for its function.

T- 3 induces terminal muscle differentiation and regulates fiber type composition via direct activation of the muscle-specific <b>myoD</b> <b>gene</b> family (e. g. myoD, myogenin). The <b>myoD</b> <b>gene</b> family can direct the fate of mesodermal cell lineages and activate muscle differentiation. Hence we investigated the expression and physiological role of Rev-erbA alpha during myogenesis. We observed abundant levels of Rev-erbA alpha mRNA in dividing C 2 C 12 myoblasts, which were suppressed when the cells differentiated into postmitotic multinucleated myotubes. This decrease in Rev-erbA alpha mRNA correlated {{with the appearance of}} muscle-specific mRNAs (e. g, myogenin and alpha-actin). Constitutive overexpression of full length Rev-erbA alpha cDNA in the myogenic cells completely abolished differentiation, suppressed myoD mRNA levels, and abrogated the induction of myogenin mRNA.

Since most mutations in lamin A/C affect skeletal muscle, we investigated lamin–chromatin interactions at promoters of muscle specific genes in both muscle and non-muscle cell lines by ChIP-qPCR. We observed that lamin A/C was specifically associated with promoter regions of muscle genes in myoblasts but not in fibroblasts. Lamin A/C dissociated from the promoter regions of the differentiation specific MyoD, myogenin and muscle creatine kinase genes when myoblasts were induced to differentiate.

Studies on several fish species have shown that the early stages of development are particularly sensitive to environmental temperature, which can affect muscle cellularity and the dynamics of muscle development and growth (Stickland et al., 1988; Sumpter, 1992). Muscle in fish, which is the major edible tissue, represents about 60 % of total body mass. Skeletal muscle development in fish differs from that of mammalian muscle in that in fish muscle mass continues to increase throughout the animal’s lifetime by hyperplasia and hypertrophy (Weatherley et al., 1988). In mammals it has been shown that, after embryological differentiation, muscle growth occurs mainly by hypertrophy of existing fibres (Stickland, 1983).

Upstream of the MRFs, the transcription co-activators and other intracellular and extracellular signals play crucial roles in regulating skeletal myogenesis. Histone acetyltransferase activity of p 300 is required for Myf 5 and MyoD expression. Furthermore, the MyoD core enhancer region is indispensable for MyoD expression. However, the mechanism by which p 300 activates <b>MyoD</b> <b>gene</b> expression is to be determined. The histone acetyltransferase activity of p 300 can be inhibited by small molecule inhibitors such as curcumin. Thus, using the inhibitor approach on stem cells is useful to investigate the role of p 300 in activating MyoD expression during myogenesis. We here show that curcumin was able to inhibit stem cell determination and differentiation into skeletal myocytes. We also show that p 300 is present, and histone acetylation is high at the core enhancer region. Therefore, we provide evidence that p 300 is directly involved in <b>MyoD</b> <b>gene</b> expression during skeletal myogenesis...|$|E
40|$|DJM was {{supported}} by a Natural Environment Research Council studentship (NERC/S/A/ 2004 / 12435). Background: MyoD is a muscle specific transcription factor that is essential for vertebrate myogenesis. In several teleost species, including representatives of the Salmonidae and Acanthopterygii, but not zebrafish, two or more MyoD paralogues are conserved that are thought to have arisen from distinct, possibly lineage-specific duplication events. Additionally, two MyoD paralogues have been characterised in the allotetraploid frog, Xenopus laevis. This has lead to a confusing nomenclature since MyoD paralogues have been named outside of an appropriate phylogenetic framework. Methods and Principal Findings: Here we initially show that directly depicting the evolutionary relationships of teleost MyoD orthologues and paralogues is hindered by the asymmetric evolutionary rate of Acanthopterygian MyoD 2 relative to other MyoD proteins. Thus our aim was to confidently position the event from which teleost paralogues arose in different lineages by a comparative investigation of <b>genes</b> neighbouring <b>myod</b> across the vertebrates. To this end, we show that genes on the single myod-containing chromosome of mammals and birds are retained in both zebrafish and Acanthopterygian teleosts in a striking pattern of double conserved synteny. Further, phylogenetic reconstruction of these neighbouring genes using Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods supported a common origin for teleost paralogues following the split of the Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii. Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest that myod was duplicated during the basal teleost whole genome duplication event, but was subsequently lost in the Ostariophysi (zebrafish) and Protacanthopterygii lineages. We propose a sensible consensus nomenclature for vertebrate <b>myod</b> <b>genes</b> that accommodates polyploidization events in teleost and tetrapod lineages and is justified from a phylogenetic perspective.

40|$|Background: Members of the {{eukaryotic}} Hsp 90 family {{function as}} important molecular chaperones in the assembly, folding and activation of cellular signaling in development. Two hsp 90 genes, hsp 90 Î± and hsp 90 Î², {{have been identified}} in fish and homeothermic vertebrates but not in poikilothermic vertebrates. In the present study, the expression of hsp 90 Î± and hsp 90 Î² genes in Xenopus laevis, which is phylogenetically positioned between zebrafish and mammals, has been addressed. Methods: Partial Xenopus hsp 90 Î± and hsp 90 Î² cDNA were identified and isolated using RT-PCR, and a full-length Xenopus hsp 90 Î² cDNA was isolated from an embryonic cDNA library. Northern-blot analysis was used to study the expression of hsp 90 Î± and hsp 90 Î² genes in total RNA of the embryos and in situ hybridization was used to compare the expression of these genes with that of hsp 70 and <b>MyoD</b> <b>genes</b> in Xenopus embryogenesis. Results: Northern-blot analysis revealed that the hsp 90 Î² gene was strongly expressed constitutively at all stages of embryogenesis, but weakly induced following the heat shock. In contrast, the hsp 90 Î± gene was weakly expressed in embryos at control temperature, but strongly up-regulated following heat shock. In situ hybridization results showed that hsp 90 Î± gene was observed predominantly in cells of the developing somite. Microscopic sections showed that hsp 90 Î± and MyoD mRNA are expressed in similar regions in somite and this pattern was distinct from that of hsp 70 and hsp 90 Î². Conclusion: These data support the hypothesis that the presence of hsp 90 Î± and hsp 90 Î² genes is conserved among vertebrates, and these genes are differentially regulated in a tissue, stress, and development stage-specific manner...|$|R

We therefore sought to evaluate changes in myostatin, follistatin and <b>MyoD</b> mRNA <b>gene</b> expression using EE and CE as probes {{to better understand}} the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy in young women. Twelve recreationally active women performed single-leg maximal eccentric [n= 6, 25 ± 1 yr (mean±SD), 59 ± 7 kg] or concentric [n= 6, 24 ± 1 yr, 65 ± 7 kg] isokinetic exercise at 60 °/s. Participants performed 10 sets of 10 maximal repetitions with 20 second rest between sets. Three muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis were obtained from the exercised leg at baseline (biopsy # 1), 8 hours after the first exercise bout (biopsy # 2), and 8 hours after the seventh and final exercise bout performed 2 weeks after the first exercise session (biopsy # 3). mRNA gene expression was determined using RT-PCR. For the CE group, there were no changes in myostatin, follistatin, and <b>MyoD</b> mRNA <b>gene</b> expression between biopsies # 1 and # 2, biopsy # 1 and # 3 (P equal to or greater than 0. 07). For the EE group, there were no changes for the same variables (P equal to or greater than 0. 17) except for MyoD expression which increased after one exercise bout (P= 0. 02). Differences between the EE and CE groups were not significant (P equal to or greater than 0. 05). These data suggest that a single bout or multiple bouts of maximal EE or CE do not significantly alter myostatin or follistatin mRNA gene expression in young women. However MyoD mRNA expression appears to increase after EE. Therefore, the type of exercise stimulus may not differentially alter specific myogenic regulators...|$|R

The <b>myoD</b> <b>gene</b> family can direct the fate of mesodermal cell lineages, repress proliferation, activate differentiation and the contractile phenotype. Hence, we investigated the expression and functional role of COUP-TF II during muscle differentiation. Proliferating C 2 C 12 myoblasts expressed COUP-TF II mRNA which was repressed when cells were induced to differentiate into post-mitotic multinucleated myotubes by serum withdrawal. Concomitant with the decrease of COUP-TF II mRNA was the appearance of muscle specific mRNAs (e. g. myogenin, alpha-actin). We show that Escherichia coli expressed full length and truncated COUP-TF II bound in a sequence specific manner to the T- 3 response elements (TREs) in the myoD and myogenin regulatory HLH genes [Olson (1992) Dev.

COUP-TF II diminished the homodimeric binding of the thyroid hormone receptor and the heterodimeric binding of thyroid hormone and retinoid X receptor complexes to these TREs. Constitutive over-expression of COUP-TF II cDNA in mouse C 2 C 12 myogenic cells suppressed the levels of myoD mRNA and blocked the induction of myogenin mRNA, whereas constitutive expression of anti-sense COUP-TF II cDNA significantly increased the steady state levels of myoD mRNA and hyper-induced myogenin mRNA.

40|$|When mouse myoblasts or {{satellite}} cells differentiate in culture, {{the expression}} of myogenic regulatory factor, MyoD, is downregulated in a subset of cells that do not differentiate. The mechanism involved in the repression of MyoD expression remains largely unknown. Here we report that a stress-response pathway repressing MyoD transcription is transiently activated in mouse-derived C 2 C 12 myoblasts growing under differentiation-promoting conditions. We show that phosphorylation of the a subunit of the translation initiation factor 2 (eIF 2 a) is followed by expression of C/EBP homology protein (CHOP) in some myoblasts. ShRNA-driven knockdown of CHOP expression caused earlier and more robust differentiation, whereas its constitutive expression delayed differentiation relative to wild type myoblasts. Cells expressing CHOP did not express the myogenic regulatory factors MyoD and myogenin. These results indicated that CHOP directly repressed the transcription of the <b>MyoD</b> <b>gene.</b> In support of this view, CHOP associated with upstream regulatory region of the <b>MyoD</b> <b>gene</b> and its activity reduced histone acetylation at the enhancer region of MyoD. CHOP interacted with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC 1) in cells. This protein complex may reduce histone acetylation when bound to MyoD regulatory regions.

40|$|Two {{skeletal}} muscle-specific regulatory factors, myogenin and MyoD 1, share extensive homology {{within a}} myc similarity region and have each {{been shown to}} activate the morphologic and molecular events associated with myogenesis after transfection into nonmyogenic cells. The BC 3 H 1 muscle cell line expresses myogenin and other muscle-specific genes, but does not express MyoD 1 during differentiation. BC 3 H 1 cells also do not upregulate alpha-cardiac actin or fast myosin light chain, nor do they form multinucleate myotubes during differentiation. In this study, we examined {{the basis for the}} lack of MyoD 1 expression in BC 3 H 1 cells and investigated whether their failure to express MyoD 1 is responsible for their defects in differentiation. We report that expression of an exogenous MyoD 1 cDNA in BC 3 H 1 cells was sufficient to elevate the expression of alpha-cardiac actin and fast myosin light chain, and to convert these cells to a phenotype that forms multinucleate myotubes during differentiation. Whereas myogenin and MyoD 1 positively regulated their own expression in transfected 10 T 1 / 2 cells, they could not, either alone or in combination, activate MyoD 1 expression in BC 3 H 1 cells. Exposure of BC 3 H 1 cells to 5 -azacytidine also failed to activate MyoD 1 expression or to rescue the cell's ability to fuse. These results suggest that BC 3 H 1 cells may possess a defect that prevents activation of the <b>MyoD</b> 1 <b>gene</b> by <b>MyoD</b> 1 or myogenin. That an exogenous <b>MyoD</b> 1 <b>gene</b> could rescue those aspects of the differentiation program that are defective in BC 3 H 1 cells also suggests that the actions of MyoD 1 and myogenin are not entirely redundant and that MyoD 1 may be required for activation of the complete repertoire of events associated with myogenesis...|$|R

AmphiMRF 2 transcription begins at mid/late gastrula in the paraxial mesoderm, but never spreads into its most anterior region. Through much of the neurula stage, AmphiMRF 2 expression is strong in the myotomal region of all somites except the most anterior pair; by late neurula expression is downregulated except in the most posterior somites forming just rostral to the tail bud.
