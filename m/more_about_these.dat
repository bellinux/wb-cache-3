The CDA on the orbiter is designed to learn <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> particles, the materials in other celestial bodies and potentially {{about the origins of}} the universe.|$|E
500|$|While {{the news}} story {{initially}} inspired Stead, she also tied in parts of her childhood into the novel. Besides the laughing man, she included her primary school, her apartment and a sandwich store where she used to work. Stead also added memories of herself acting mean without reason. Slowly the novel became [...] "more and <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> ordinary mysteries of life and less about the fantastic time-travel-y one". After developing the basic idea, Stead began researching the science behind time travel to make sure her ideas would be logical. She asked her father for help with the science and complicated technical aspects, since he enjoyed mathematical puzzles. As they talked about time travel, Stead [...] "just kept falling into the same hole with the logic, and he really helped me straighten it out".|$|E

However, in August 2012, Iger announced that Whedon would return to write and direct the sequel and develop the Marvel television series, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., for ABC. Later in the month, Disney set a May 1, 2015 release date. When asked about his decision to return, Whedon said, [...] "Avengers 2, it wasn't a tough decision. For a long time I thought, 'Well, it's {{just not going to}} happen.' Then when I actually started to consider it, it became so clear that I desperately wanted to say <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> characters, it would've been an easy no and it was a spectacularly easy yes. There was no wrestling." [...] Whedon said that they intended for the film's production to not be as rushed as the first one.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{director}} Stanley Kubrick's {{death and}} the Columbine High School massacre occurred within months of each other; Ledonne credited the two events with changing his life. After seeing A Clockwork Orange, Ledonne discovered that film could comment on culture; after the Columbine shootings, {{he realized he was}} headed down the same path as the shooters. [...] "It was a bit scary, once I learned <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> boys, because it was like I was looking in the mirror and I didn't want the same fate for myself," [...] Ledonne said. He began taking martial arts, studying film, and saw a therapist. By the time he graduated from Alamosa High School, Ledonne had a 4.0 grade point average and was voted [...] "most likely to succeed" [...] by his peers. He studied film at Emerson College and moved back to Colorado to form his own production company, Emberwild Productions, which mostly edits wedding videos.|$|E

2500|$|One area of {{research}} featuring nanobiotechnology is the extracellular matrices of cells (ECM). The ECM is primarily composed of interwoven fibers of collagen and elastin that have diameters ranging from 10–300nm. [...] In addition to holding the cell in place, the ECM {{has a variety of}} other functions including providing a point of attachment for the ECM of other cells and transmembrane receptors that are essential for life. Until recently it has been nearly impossible to study the physical forces that help cells maintain their functionality, but nanobiotechnology has given us the ability to learn <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> interactions. Using the unique properties of nanoparticles, it is possible to control how the nanoparticles adhere to certain patterns present in the ECM, and as a result can understand how changes in the ECM's shape can affect cell functionality.|$|E

Clubs Kyle Fowle felt that while [...] "it's certainly frustrating to see one of TV's prominent lesbian characters written off so hastily," [...] the show made Lexa's death mean something. In his opinion, episode [...] "Thirteen" [...] is [...] "a remarkable episode, one that deepens the mythology of The 100 while also delivering on a number of character threads that have been left dangling for much of this season so far."
