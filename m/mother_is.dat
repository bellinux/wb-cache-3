Compensatory influence was noted across relationships, so that children whose actions <b>were</b> protested by <b>mothers</b> <b>were</b> less likely to object to the behaviour of their siblings. In general, when <b>mothers</b> <b>were</b> well, families experienced frequent, but mild conflict; when mothers had bipolar illness, {{the relationship between the}} mother and the elder son was especially fraught; and when <b>mothers</b> <b>were</b> depressed, conflicts were more likely to escalate and to occur between mothers and daughters...|$|R
