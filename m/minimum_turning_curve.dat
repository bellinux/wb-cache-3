40|$|This paper characterizes time-optimal trajectories in {{anisotropic}} (direction-dependent) environ-ments where path curvatures are {{bounded by}} the <b>minimum</b> <b>turning</b> radius of a mobile agent. Such problems are often faced in the navigation of aerial, ground and naval vehicles when a mobile agent cannot instantaneously change its heading angle. The presented {{work is a}} generalization of the Du-bins car problem, which considers fastest paths with bounded curvature while assuming constant speed and <b>minimum</b> <b>turning</b> radius. We relax this assumption and discuss fastest-path finding prob-lems for the generalized direction-dependent speed and <b>minimum</b> <b>turning</b> radius functions, {{to account for the}} effects of waves, winds and slope of the terrain on the agent’s motions. We establish that there exists an optimal path such that it is a portion of a path of the type CSCSC where C denotes a sharpest <b>turn</b> <b>curve</b> and S a straight line segment. Further analysis of a special case (wherein the speed polar plot is convex) delivers a more detailed characterization of an optimal path and presents an algorithm that implements our results...|$|R

Numerous calculations of stopping sight distance, <b>minimum</b> <b>turning</b> radius, and <b>curve</b> alignments are required during the design process to ensure safety, to minimize economic and environmental impact, and to reduce construction costs. Students usually perform iterative computations manually during the design process to meet design criteria and environmental constraints. The traditional process of roadway geometry design is cumbersome and time consuming. The traditional approach limits students from taking a broader perspective in the overall roadway geometry design process. An Internet-based roadway design tool (ROAD: Roadway Online Application for Design) was developed to enhance the learning experience for transportation engineering students. This tool allows students to design the roadway efficiently and to modify the design easily within given economic and environmental parameters. A 3 -Dimensional (3 D) roadway geometry model can be generated by the software at final design to allow students to place themselves in the driver’s seat and maneuver through the designed roadway at maximum design speed.

40|$|Identification of gait events {{using an}} optimal sensor set and a {{reliable}} algorithm {{would be useful}} in the clinical evaluation of patients with dropped foot. This article describes a threshold detection method for identifying gait events and evaluating the reliability of a system on ten subjects with dropped foot and three non-impaired controls. The system comprised three sensor units of accelerometers and gyroscopes attached at the thigh, shank and foot of the impaired leg in subjects with dropped foot, and the dominant leg in the controls. A performance index was devised to compare the values of different measuring directions of the sensor units and evaluate the system's reliability. The performance index, with the ideal value equal to 1, depended on the classification accuracy and timing variation of the turning points. These {{were obtained from the}} threshold detection method that distinguished the absolute maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>turning</b> points from local maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>turning</b> points. It was found that some specific turning points could effectively identify gait events with a high median value in the performance index. These turning points included: the <b>minimum</b> <b>turning</b> point in superior-inferior acceleration on the thigh at loading response (0. 972); the <b>minimum</b> <b>turning</b> point in anterior-posterior angular velocity on the shank at pre-swing (0. 955) and the maximum turning point in superior-inferior acceleration on the foot at initial swing (0. 954). Combining the results of sensor measurements in different orientations and attachment locations could be used for gait event identification. It was shown that the threshold detection method is reliable. Portable gait-monitoring devices can be used for monitoring of daily activities and functional control.

40|$|Size-dependent {{behavior}} of laminates with curvilinear fibers made by automated fiber placement Abstract: Variable stiffness laminates can be manufac-tured using curvilinear fiber paths. A curvilinear fiber path is generally defined {{based on the}} plate size and has a curvature that {{is dependent on the}} plate size. In prac-tice, however, the fiber path must satisfy manufacturing constraints, such as the <b>minimum</b> <b>turning</b> radius imposed by the automated fiber placement machine, thereby lim-iting the possible amount of fiber steering. In this work, we studied the effect of the plate size on the structural properties of a plate manufactured with curvilinear fibers. We considered four plate sizes, which were designed by a constant curvature fiber path. We optimized the plates for both maximum buckling load and in-plane stiffness. The results showed that the in-plane stiffness of the plate was not controlled by the plate size, whereas the buckling load was highly affected by the curvature of the fiber path. Hence, the potential of a buckling load increase reduced for plate sizes smaller than the <b>minimum</b> <b>turning</b> radius. In addition, for a given maximum curvature of the fiber path, the influence of a complex layup on the buckling load was marginal...|$|R
