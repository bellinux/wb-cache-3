40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} equity {{valuation}} using <b>multiples.</b> Our basic {{conclusion is that}} <b>multiples</b> nearly always have broad dispersion, which is why valuations performed using <b>multiples</b> may be highly debatable. We review the 14 most popular <b>multiples</b> {{and deal with the}} problem of using <b>multiples</b> for valuation: their dispersion. 1, 200 <b>multiples</b> from 175 companies illustrate the dispersion of <b>multiples</b> of European utilities, English utilities, European construction companies, hotel companies, telecommunications companies, banks and Internet companies. We also show that PER, EBITDA and Profit after Tax (the most commonly used parameters for <b>multiples)</b> were more volatile than equity value during the period 1991 - 1999. We provide additional evidence of the analysts' recommendations for Spanish companies: less than 15 % of the recommendations are to sell. However, <b>multiples</b> are useful in a second stage of the valuation: after performing the valuation using another method, a comparison with the <b>multiples</b> of comparable firms enables us to gauge the accuracy of the valuation and identify differences between the firm valued and the firms it is compared with.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{accuracy}} and valuation {{implications of the}} application of a comprehensive list of equity <b>multiples</b> in the takeover context. Motivating the study is the prevalent use of equity <b>multiples</b> in practice, the observed long-run underperformance of acquirers following takeovers, and the scarcity of multiplesbased research in the merger and acquisition setting. In exploring the application of equity <b>multiples</b> in this context three research questions are addressed: (1) how accurate are equity <b>multiples</b> (RQ 1); which equity <b>multiples</b> are more accurate in valuing the firm (RQ 2); and which equity <b>multiples</b> are associated with greater misvaluation of the firm (RQ 3). Following a comprehensive review of the extant multiples-based literature it is hypothesised that the accuracy of <b>multiples</b> in estimating stock market prices in the takeover context will rank as follows (from best to worst) : (1) forecasted earnings <b>multiples,</b> (2) <b>multiples</b> closer to bottom line earnings, (3) <b>multiples</b> based on Net Cash Flow from Operations (NCFO) and trading revenue. The relative inaccuracies in <b>multiples</b> are expected to flow through to equity misvaluation (as measured by the ratio of estimated market capitalisation to residual income value, or P/V). Accordingly, it is hypothesised that greater overvaluation will be exhibited for <b>multiples</b> based on Trading Revenue, NCFO, Book Value (BV) and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) versus <b>multiples</b> based on bottom line earnings; and that <b>multiples</b> based on Intrinsic Value will display the least overvaluation. The hypotheses are tested using a sample of 147 acquirers and 129 targets involved in Australian takeover transactions announced between 1990 and 2005. The results show that first, the majority of computed <b>multiples</b> examined exhibit valuation errors within 30 percent of stock market values. Second, and consistent with expectations, the results provide support for the superiority of <b>multiples</b> based on forecasted earnings in valuing targets and acquirers engaged in takeover transactions. Although a gradual improvement in estimating stock market values is not entirely evident when moving down the Income Statement, historical earnings <b>multiples</b> perform better than <b>multiples</b> based on Trading Revenue or NCFO. Third, while <b>multiples</b> based on forecasted earnings have the highest valuation accuracy they, along with Trading Revenue <b>multiples</b> for targets, produce the most overvalued valuations for acquirers and targets. Consistent with predictions, greater overvaluation is exhibited for <b>multiples</b> based on Trading Revenue for targets, and NCFO and EBITDA for both acquirers and targets. Finally, as expected, <b>multiples</b> based Intrinsic Value (along with BV) are associated with the least overvaluation. Given the widespread usage of valuation <b>multiples</b> in takeover contexts these findings offer a unique insight into their relative effectiveness. Importantly, the findings add to the growing body of valuation accuracy literature, especially within Australia, and should assist market participants to better understand the relative accuracy and misvaluation consequences of various equity <b>multiples</b> used in takeover documentation and assist them in subsequent investment decision making...|$|R

The typical powder section of such an arrow-rocket was 1/3 and 1/2 ft (10 to 15 cm) long.

The Chinese also enhanced rocket tips with poison and made sure that the launchers were also mobile. Song Chinese rocket designers designed <b>multiple</b> rocket launchers that could be carried and operated by a single soldier.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} {{attenuate}} diffracted <b>multiples</b> with an apex-shifted tangent-squared Radon transform in angle domain common image gathers (ADCIG). Usually, where diffracted <b>multiples</b> are a problem, the wave field propagation is complex and the moveout of primaries and <b>multiples</b> in data space is irregular. The method handles {{the complexity of the}} wave field propagation by wave-equation migration provided that migration velocities are reasonably accurate. As a result, the moveout of the <b>multiples</b> is well behaved in the ADCIGs. For 2 D data, the apex-shifted tangent-squared Radon transform maps the 2 D space image into a 3 D space-cube model whose dimensions are depth, curvature and apex-shift distance. Well-corrected primaries map to or near the zero curvature plane and specularly-reflected <b>multiples</b> map to or near the zero apex-shift plane. Diffracted <b>multiples</b> map elsewhere in the cube according to their curvature and apex-shift distance. Thus, specularly reflected as well as diffracted <b>multiples</b> can be attenuated simultaneously. This approach is illustrated with a segment of a 2 D seismic line over a large salt body in the Gulf of Mexico. It is shown that ignoring the apex shift compromises the attenuation of the diffracted <b>multiples,</b> whereas the approach proposed attenuates both the specularly-reflected and the diffracted <b>multiples</b> without compromising the primaries...|$|R
