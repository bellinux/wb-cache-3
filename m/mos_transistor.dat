A number of secondary gates or inputs are then deposited above the floating gate (FG) and are electrically isolated from it.

5000|$|Hot carrier {{injection}} (HCI) {{is a phenomenon}} in solid-state electronic devices where an electron or a “hole” gains sufficient kinetic energy to overcome a potential barrier necessary to break an interface state. The term [...] "hot" [...] refers to the effective temperature used to model carrier density, not to the overall temperature of the device.

50|$|In {{semiconductor}} devices, leakage is {{a quantum}} phenomenon where mobile charge carriers (electrons or holes) tunnel through an insulating region. Leakage increases exponentially as {{the thickness of}} the insulating region decreases. Tunneling leakage can also occur across semiconductor junctions between heavily doped P-type and N-type semiconductors. Other than tunneling via the gate insulator or junctions, carriers can also leak between source and drain terminals of a Metal Oxide Semiconductor (<b>MOS)</b> <b>transistor.</b> This is called subthreshold conduction. The primary source of leakage occurs inside transistors, but electrons can also leak between interconnects.

50|$|Though phase-change memory offers much promise, {{there are}} still certain {{technical}} problems {{that need to be}} solved before it can reach ultra-high density and commercialized. The most important challenge for phase-change memory is to reduce the programming current to the level that is compatible with the minimum <b>MOS</b> <b>transistor</b> drive current for high-density integration. Currently, the programming current in phase-change memory is substantially high. This high current limits the memory density of the phase-change memory cells as the current supplied by the transistor is not sufficient due to their high current requirement. Hence, the unique scaling advantage of phase-change memory cannot be fully utilized.|$|E

Dry cleaning methods include oxygen and argon plasma treatments to remove unwanted surface layers, or hydrogen bake at elevated temperature to remove native oxide before epitaxy. Pre-gate cleaning {{is the most}} critical cleaning step in CMOS fabrication: it ensures that the ca. 2 nm thick oxide of a <b>MOS</b> <b>transistor</b> can be grown in an orderly fashion.
