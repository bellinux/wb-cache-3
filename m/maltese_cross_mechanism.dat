50|$|In 35 mm and 70 mm projectors, there {{usually is}} a special {{sprocket}} immediately underneath the pressure plate, known as the intermittent sprocket. Unlike all the other sprockets in the projector, which run continuously, the intermittent sprocket operates {{in tandem with the}} shutter, and only moves while the shutter is blocking the lamp, so that the motion of the film cannot be seen. It also moves in a discrete amount at a time, equal to the number of perforations that make up a frame (4 for 35 mm, 5 for 70 mm). The intermittent movement in these projectors is usually provided by a Geneva drive, also known as the <b>Maltese</b> <b>Cross</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E
40|$|This article {{suggests}} that the widely adopted principles of the Cinema of Attractions is a limited framework for studying the early period of the invention of moving pictures and proposes the use of ideas drawn from writers on {{the social construction of}} technology as the basis for a more useful and comprehensive methodology for analysis of the early period of invention. With examples drawn from both the technological artefacts of early cinema (the <b>Maltese</b> <b>Cross</b> intermittent <b>mechanism,</b> the Lumière Cinématographe) and from emerging cinematic practices (travelling exhibitors, optical projection systems), the alternative methodology described here is shown to be helpful in re-evaluating and restructuring the archaic inherited master narrative of the invention of moving pictures. The essay {{suggests that}} by looking at the material technology and practices of early cinema without prejudice or prior assumption, there is still much to be learned from surviving resources too long ignored; which in turn reveals a distinct need to restructure the habitual story of invention, which was formed in the 1920 s and remains largely untested by modern scholarship...|$|R

40|$|Babesia microti, a hemoprotozoan {{parasite}} of rodents, is {{also important}} as a zoonotic agent of human babesiosis. The <b>Maltese</b> <b>cross</b> form, which consists of four masses in an erythrocyte, is characteristic of the developmental stage of B. microti. Monoclonal antibody (MAb) 2 - 1 E, which specifically recognizes the <b>Maltese</b> <b>cross</b> form of B. microti, has been described previously. In the present study, we examined {{the roles of the}} <b>Maltese</b> <b>cross</b> form during the infectious course of B. microti in mice. The number of the <b>Maltese</b> <b>cross</b> form increased in the peripheral blood of infected mice prior to the peak of parasitemia. With confocal laser scanning microscopy, MAb 2 - 1 E was found to be reactive with the ring form, with the parasites undergoing transformation to the <b>Maltese</b> <b>cross</b> form and subsequent division, and also with extracellular merozoites. Furthermore, the <b>Maltese</b> <b>cross</b> form-related antigen (MRA) gene was isolated from a B. microti cDNA library by immunoscreening with MAb 2 - 1 E, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. Genomic analyses indicated that the MRA gene exists as a single-copy gene in B. microti. Immunization of mice with recombinant MRA induced significant protective immunity against B. microti infection. These findings indicate that the <b>Maltese</b> <b>cross</b> form plays important roles in both the development of parasitemia and the protective response against the infection...|$|R
