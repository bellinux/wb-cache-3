50|$|In trucks category, {{complete}} domination by Kamaz {{and defending}} champion Anton Shibalov, only interrupted by Tomas Tomecek in stages 9 and 10 (when Kamaz faced problems), despite the problems {{he had in}} the 4th stage (2 flat tyres and broken shock-absorver) and early lost of his assistance truck due do <b>mecanichal</b> issues. A breakdown in the 2nd Kamaz of Kuprianov would put him out of the podium completed by Elisabete Jacinto making of regularity her main weapon.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{versatile}} on-chip tensile testing method is {{proposed for the}} statistical evaluation of size effects on the <b>mecanichal</b> strenght of silicon thin films along with the simultaneous study of (from low to ultra) strain effects on the carrier transport. Mechanical results are presented on the fracture strenght of micro-nano scale silicon beams, followed with a discussion on interface states and problems facing reliable nano-electronic and nano-electromechanical characterizations...|$|E
40|$|Similar to the {{classical}} solution of hydraulic pump-turbine plant, new means for accumulation of eletrical energy are given for lower but respectable quantities by the so called BESS (Battery Energy Storage System) and SMES (Super conducting Magnet Energy Storage). Another energy accumulator is given by using <b>mecanichal</b> kinetic energy of fly-wheel. Each system has advantages and disadvantage {{from the point of}} wiew of the quantity of stored energy and magnitude of the instantaneous usable power. A realistic application of energy storage, using the advantages of their complementarity. The modern energy conversion techniques allow fast, and flexible power control, and also reactive power compensation...|$|E
