40|$|The {{impacts of}} climate change on the water cycle of the Aliakmon River basin in Western Macedonia and the {{operation}} of the Polyfito Reservoir are examined in the current study. Two climate change scenarios, the UKHI and HadCMZ, are applied to estimate the climatically induced changes in the water cycle and the altered inflows to the reservoir. A reduction of the <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> and an increase of the potential evapotranspiration in the study area are observed under climatically changed conditions. The results show an increase of the risk associated with the annual hydroelectric energy production of the Polyfito Reservoir. In order to maintain the risk at the design level, storage volume increases are required. These results are in accordance with the results of previous studies referring to the assessment {{of climate change}} impacts on the water resources and on the design and operation of reservoirs in central Greece...|$|E
40|$|A fully {{integrated}} Atmospheric-Ocean-Hydrology Model (BALTIMOS = Baltic Integrated Model System) {{has been developed}} using existing model components. Experiment and model design has been adapted to the Baltic basin with a catchment area of approximately 1 750 000 km 2. A comprehensive model validation has been completed using large meteorological and hydrological measurement database. Comparing the calculated runoff from the integrated and non-integrated model system with measurements for three different representative subbasins and the entire Baltic basin, {{the effect of the}} integrated model is described. The results display a good agreement between measured and calculated runoff. The effect of the integrated model is rather negligible looking at computed mean values: There is no significant difference between <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> of the integrated and non-integrated model during the year with the exception of spring. There is a delay of one month with regard to peak runoff for the non-integrated model in spring caused by different interactive processes during the melting period...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the impacts of climate change on water {{resources}} (surface runoff) and on water quality. Two GCM-based climate change scenarios are considered: transient (HadCM 2) and equilibrium (UKHI). A conceptual, physically based hydrological model (WBUDG) is applied on a catchment in central Greece, simulating the effect of the two climate scenarios on average monthly runoff. A newly developed in the stream model (R-Qual) is applied in order to simulate water quality downstream of a point source under current and climatically changed conditions. Simulated parameters include monthly concentrations of BOD, DO and NH 4 +. Both scenarios suggest increase of temperature and decrease of precipitation in the study region. Those changes result in a significant decrease of <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> for almost all months with a considerable negative impact on summer drought. Moreover, quality simulations under future climatic conditions entail significant water quality impairments because of decreased stream flows. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

The trends and the change points of runoff and climate from 1956 to 2003 were detected using the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt-Mann-Whitney change-point statistics. The correlations between runoff and climate change were analyzed using multiple linear regression. The major results could be summarized as follows: (1) The annual mean runoff during the last 50 years is characterized by a great fluctuation and a positive trend with two change points (around 1970 and the early 1980 s), after which the runoff tended to increase and was increasing intensively in the last 20 years. Besides, the <b>monthly</b> <b>mean</b> <b>runoff</b> with a positive trend is centralized in winter half-year (November to April) and some other months (May, July and September). (2) The trends of the climate change in the study area are generally consistent with the trend of the runoff, but the leading climate factors which aroused the runoff variation are distinct. Precipitation is the dominant factor influencing the annual and <b>monthly</b> <b>mean</b> <b>runoff</b> in summer half year, while temperature is the primary factor in winter season...|$|R

40|$|The A-Luoi {{district}} in Thua Thien Hue province of Vietnam is under extreme pressure from natural and anthropogenic factors. The area is ungauged and suffering from data scarcity. To evaluate the water resources availability and water management, we used Soil and Water Assessment Tools (SWAT). A multi-approach technique {{was used to}} calibrate the hydrological model. The model was calibrated in three time scales: daily, monthly and yearly by river discharge, actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and crop yield, respectively. The model was calibrated with Nash-Sutcliffe and R 2 coefficients greater than 0. 7, in daily and monthly scales, respectively. In the yearly scale, the crop yield inside the model was calibrated and validated with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) less than 2. 4 ton/ha. The water resource components were mapped temporally and spatially. The outcomes showed that the highest <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> surface <b>runoff,</b> 323 to 369 mm, between September and November, resulted in extreme soil erosion and sedimentation. The monthly average of actual evapotranspiration was the highest in May and lowest in December.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} validation of a water balance model of the Upper Blue Nile in Ethiopia. A major requirement of any modelling attempt is the availability of climatic and hydrological data. However, for the Upper Blue Nile, {{only a limited number}} of observation sites are available over a very large area. As a result, the model described here is a grid-based water balance model which requires limited data inputs, few parameters and runs on a monthly time-step. Climate is dominated by the influence of elevation in the river basin. Estimates of potential évapotranspiration (PE) and rainfall are predicted for 10 -minute resolution grid cells for input to the model. These estimates are based on multiple regression models using latitude, longitude and elevation. In the basin, annual mean PE and rainfall range, with increasing elevation, from 1800 mm to 1200 mm and 924 mm to 1845 mm, respectively. In the model, vegetation cover is not explicitly treated and soil characteristics are spatially invariant.

The overarching goal of this undertaking was to provide useful information to Nalcor Energy, a hydroelectric developer, regarding {{the change in the}} amount and timing of water in the Churchill River between a base period (1971 - 2000) and a future period (2041 - 2070). Three separate multi-model approaches used data from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program to look at the impacts of climate change on the Churchill River: (i) Bias-corrected precipitation and temperature data forced a hydrologic model to investigate the changes in mean daily streamflow for the Pinus River, a subbasin of the Churchill River; (ii) A new approach (dubbed “fullstream analysis”) took advantage of the full range of simulated hydrological variables from each ensemble member and was used to study the expected changes in mean annual runoff of the entire basin, and; (iii) Weighted multi-model ensembles examined the simulated impacts of climate change on <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> for the entire basin.

The seasonality of mean monthly precipitation and runoff was quantified by the Pardé coefficient and the seasonality of the maximum annual floods and annual maximum daily precipitation by applying the Burn’s index. Altogether 555 climate stations located in Austria and 202 climate stations in Slovakia were selected for analysis of mean monthly precipitation.

40|$|This {{study is}} focused to {{identify}} the surface runoff trends and potentiality of the five watersheds transforming the discrete runoff pattern to smooth patterns. Runoff potentiality was analyzed by Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) technique. Considering Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG) and percentage of particular land use pattern, weighted CNs of five watersheds were found between 82 and 85. <b>Monthly</b> surface <b>runoff</b> trends were investigated by statistical autocorrelation, Mann-Kendall, Sen slope and lowess methods. According to the Mann-Kendall method, no statistical significant monotonic trends were found for all the watersheds. Smoothing curve analysis reveals that the <b>monthly</b> <b>mean</b> <b>runoff</b> is 30 mm, 34 mm, 39 mm, 28 mm and 37 mm {{and the percentage of}} runoff is 23 %, 25 %, 31 %, 25 % and 26 % for the watersheds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Monthly {{precipitation}} {{and temperature}} trends of 51 {{stations in the}} Yangtze basin from 1950 – 2002 were analysed and interpolated. The Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to examine the monthly precipitation and temperature data. Significant positive and negative trends at the 90, 95 and 99 % significance levels were detected. The <b>monthly</b> <b>mean</b> temperature, precipitation, summer precipitation and <b>monthly</b> <b>mean</b> <b>runoff</b> at Yichang, Hankou and Datong stations were analysed. The results indicate that spatial distribution of precipitation and temperature trends is different. The middle and lower Yangtze basin is dominated by upward precipitation trend but by somewhat downward temperature trend; while downward precipitation trend and upward temperature trend occur in the upper Yangtze basin. This is because increasing precipitation leads to increasing cloud coverage and, hence, results in decreasing ground surface temperature. Average monthly precipitation and temperature analysis for the upper, middle and lower Yangtze basin, respectively, further corroborate this viewpoint. Analysis of precipitation trend for these three regions and of runoff trends for the Yichang, Hankou and Datong stations indicated that runoff trends respond wel...|$|R

VIC was calibrated with both observed monthly LAI and long-term <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> LAI, which were derived from the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) leaf area index dataset covering the period from 1982 to 2012. The model performance under wet and dry climates for the two different LAI inputs was assessed using three criteria, the classical Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, the logarithm transformed flow Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and the percentage bias. Finally, the deviation of the simulated <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> using the observed monthly LAI from simulated <b>runoff</b> using long-term <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> LAI was computed. The VIC model predicted <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> in the selected sub-catchments with model efficiencies ranging from 61. 5 % to 95. 9 % during calibration (1982 – 1997) and 59 % to 92. 4 % during validation (1998 – 2012). Our results suggest systematic improvements, from 4 % to 25 % in Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, in sparsely forested sub-catchments when the VIC model was calibrated with observed monthly LAI instead of long-term <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> LAI. There was limited systematic improvement in tree dominated sub-catchments. The results also suggest that the model overestimation or underestimation of runoff during wet and dry periods {{can be reduced to}} 25 mm and 35 mm respectively by including the year-to-year variability of LAI in the model, thus reflecting the responses of vegetation to fluctuations in climate and other factors. Hence, the year-to-year variability in LAI should not be neglected; rather it should be included in model calibration as well as simulation of monthly water balance...|$|R

40|$|The stream runoff model {{developed}} by Mohseni and Stefan (1996) has a monthly time scale {{and is based}} on the water budget theory. Its function is to make <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> projections under different climate scenarios. The model uses 6 climate variables, 11 watershed and soil parameters, and 3 parameters related to both climate and runoff. Some of the parameters are measurable and, therefore, obtainable as model input. The model lumps all watershed and soil parameters both vertically and horizontally. A nonsystematic calibration procedure gives different results, depending on the initial values chosen for some of the calibration parameters. The calibration parameters of the model are related to the two processes which are the most difficult to quantity and where the most information is required: direct runoff and snowmelt runoff. A systematic calibration procedure has been added to the original model to avoid inconsistencies in the results. The systematic calibration procedure is selected for the direct runoff parameters. For the snowmelt runoff, only some modifications in input are implemented. Base flow algorithm also required some changes in estimating the hydraulic conductivity of the storage below the root zone in order to better fit the water budget theory and Darcy's Law. For testing, the modified model is applied to two watersheds in two different climate regions, one in northern Minnesota and one in southwestern Oklahoma.

40|$|A {{sustainable}} {{water resources}} management depends on sound information about the impacts of climate change. This information is, however, not easily derived because natural runoff variability interferes with the climate change signal. This study presents a procedure that leads to robust estimates of magnitude and Time Of Emergence (TOE) of climate-induced hydrological change that also account for the natural variability contained in the time series. Firstly, natural variability of 189 mesoscale catchments in Switzerland is sampled for 10 ENSEMBLES scenarios for the control (1984 – 2005) and two scenario periods (near future: 2025 – 2046, far future: 2074 – 2095) applying a bootstrap procedure. Then, the sampling distributions of <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> are tested for significant differences with the Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney test and for effect size with Cliff’s delta d. Finally, the TOE of a climate change induced hydrological change is determined when at least eight out of the ten hydrological projections significantly differ from natural variability. The {{results show that the}} TOE occurs in the near future period except for high-elevated catchments in late summer. The significant hydrological projections in the near future correspond, however, to only minor runoff changes. In the far future, hydrological change is statistically significant and runoff changes are substantial. Temperature change is the most important factor determining hydrological change in this mountainous region. Therefore, hydrological change depends strongly on a catchment’s mean elevation. Considering that the hydrological changes are predicted to be robust in the near future highlights the importance of accounting for these changes in water resources planning...|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} incorporated snow algorithm in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) {{was applied}} to consider spatial variation of associated snow parameters by elevation band for flow simulation of five mountainous river basins with different climatic conditions including the Narayani (Nepal), Vakhsh (Central Asia), Rhone (Switzerland), Mendoza (Central Andes, Argentina), and Central Dry Andes (Chile) with total area of 85, 000 km^(2). The results by modified snow algorithm implied slight to noticeable improvement in simulation of flow cycles and volume depend on the percentage of glacier area and climatic type of a subbasin. The ability of model in simulation of glacier mass balance and Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) then was evaluated for three reference glaciers and their neighboring glacier ranges across the Europe and central Asia. The modified model successfully simulated the annual glacier loss, mass balance profile and annual ELAs with light calibration efforts and limited data. The results revealed that even very good result in <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> simulation alone does not imply the consistency between simulated and measured mass balances. Calibrating the model versus flow data in combination with data of glaciers considerably reduced the model parameterization uncertainty and enhanced mass balance simulation accuracy. To assess the range of future climate change impacts on the glacier runoff, we used maximum, minimum air temperature and precipitation projections under two RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathway) climate change scenarios and six Coupled Model Intercomparison Project- 5 (CMIP 5) models. Simulations of <b>mean</b> annual and <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff,</b> high (Q 5) and low (Q 95) <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> and flow duration curves (FDCs) under baseline (1979 ? 2008) and climate change scenarios are presented for all river basins.

40|$|The GROWA {{model was}} applied to the entire Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia (ca. 34, 000 km(2)) using a grid {{resolution}} of 100 m. It conceptually combines distributed meteorological data (winter and summer precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) with distributed site parameters (land use, soil properties, slope gradient, slope exposure, mean depth to groundwater) to facilitate the calculation of long-term annual averages of total runoff. In the GROWA model groundwater recharge is expressed as a constant proportion (baseflow indices) of the total runoff. This portion depends on certain characteristics of the investigated area, e. g. the slope gradient, soil and hydrogeological properties as well as the degree of surface sealing. In this paper special emphasis is put on the influence of geology on groundwater recharge. In this respect, a new calibration procedure for the parameterization of geology-related parameters is described. In previous applications of the GROWA model baseflow indices have been identified on the basis of observed <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> low-water <b>runoff</b> values (MoMLR). Since the MoMLR-values significantly overestimate groundwater recharge in solid rock regions due to high interflow proportions, a more sophisticated hydrograph separation method has been applied. In this study runoff data from about 125 gauging stations within the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia were used to derive baseflow indices. The raster-based simulation was carried out using a grid resolution of 100 m. The accuracy of the calculated groundwater recharge values for the period 1979 - 1999 was verified on the basis of data from gauging stations. A good agreement between observed runoff values from the sub-catchments and model results was achieved. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

There are also some evidences indicate that climate change can influence water quality worldwide (Wolfram & Heike 2009; Burton et al. 2010; Huang et al. 2010). According to some research, the changes of precipitation, temperature, radiation, and wind caused by climate change will affect migration and transformation pathways {{as well as other}} biochemistry processes of pollutants in environment. It will lead to the change of reaction rate constant, adsorption rate, and dynamic constants of bioaccumulation of pollutants, resulting in the change of water quality (Frisk et al. 1997; Yu et al. 2002; Schiedek et al. 2007; Elias & Elias 2010). Therefore, climate change is an important factor affecting both water quantity and quality in rivers. Mimikou et al. (2000) have studied the effects of regional climate change on water quality in the Pinios river basin situated in the central part of Greece, and Prathumraana et al. (2008) have studied the lower Mekong River in Indochina; their results showed that the decrease of <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> induced by climate change had led to the degradation of water quality. In addition, Jenet et al. (2010) have studied the impacts of regional climate change on water quality in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, and their results showed that regional climate changes, particularly increase in temperature and decrease in runoff volume, can also influence water quality. However, there are few research reports about the effect of climate change on water quality and quantity as well as the relationship between them of a river for a long period.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the climatic and landscape {{controls on the}} flow duration curve (FDC) {{with the use of}} a physically-based rainfall-runoff model. The FDC is a stochastic representation of the variability of runoff, which arises from the transformation, by the catchment, of within-year variability of precipitation that can itself be characterized by a corresponding duration curve for precipitation (PDC). Numerical simulations are carried out with the rainfall-runoff model under a variety of combinations of climatic inputs (i. e. precipitation, potential evaporation, including their within-year variability) and landscape properties (i. e. soil type and depth). The simulations indicated that the FDC can be disaggregated into two components, with sharply differing characteristics and origins: the FDC for surface (fast) runoff (SFDC) and the FDC for subsurface (slow) runoff (SSFDC), which included base flow in our analysis. SFDC closely tracked PDC and can be approximated {{with the use of a}} simple, nonlinear (threshold) filter model. On the other hand, SSFDC tracked the FDC that is constructed from the regime curve (i. e. <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff),</b> which can be closely approximated by a linear filter model. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to understand the climate and landscape controls on each component, gaining useful physical insights into their respective shapes. In particular the results suggested that evaporation from dynamic saturated areas, especially in the dry season, can contribute to a sharp dip at the lower tail of the FDCs. Based on these results, we develop a conceptual framework for the reconstruction of FDCs in ungauged basins. This framework partitions the FDC into: (1) a fast flow component, governed by a filtered version of PDC, (2) a slow flow component governed by the regime curve, and (3) a correction to SSFDC to capture the effects of high evapotranspiration (ET) at low flows...|$|E

Sequential aerial photography is used to determine changes in the extent of the Zostera beds on the flood delta, this being indicative of changes in the substrate sediments. Four cores were taken from the flood delta, and standard grainsize analysis techniques employed to establish the composition and characteristics of the sediments. Together with survey work and other ancillary information, these twci techniques enable description of the sedimentation changes and the present sediment dynamics on the flood tide delta. Virgin catchment runoff was simulated using two models, having rainfall data as the primary input. Simulated and actual runoff, as determined from gauge plate data, were qualitatively compared in terms of <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> and cumulative annual runoff. This, together with an examination of temporal increases in the total volume of water impounded in the catchment, enables the impact of dams on the hydrology of the river to be determined.

Temporally, these changes correlate well with increased impoundment of runoff in the catchment.

The Manwan Dam, {{the first of the}} 14 dams, began operating in 1993, and the associated downstream runoff may have been affected by its construction. To assess this impact, we first investigated the relationships between <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> observed from the Gajiu station and meteorological data obtained from four meteorological gauging stations with a time-lag of 0 - 3 months over the pre-dam period (1957 - 2000). Second, we established and validated a multiple linear regression equation employing monthly meteorological and hydrological data during the pre-dam period. Finally, we simulated the <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> after dam construction (1993 - 2000) using the established equations and assessed the impact of dam construction on runoff by comparing the observed actual <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> with the simulated <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff.</b> Our results suggested a very high hydro-meteorological correlation for the pre-dam period, which opened up the possibility of runoff forecasting. Further, the multiple linear regression equation displayed good simulation performance as coefficient of determination (R 2) and the Nash-Suttcliffe coefficient (NS) reached 0. 84 and 0. 82 respectively.

Further we applied an approach, which shows the potential of glacier melt contribution during the extreme hot and dry summer of 2003 by calculating the quotient qA 03 of the <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> August <b>runoff</b> in 2003 and the long-term mean August runoff. The extreme summer 2003 was worth to be analysed as from the meteorological and glaciological point of view an extraordinary situation was observed. During June and July nearly the entire snow-cover melted and during the hot and dry August mainly ice melt of glaciers contributed to runoff. The mean runoff in August 2003 was calculated from observed mean daily runoff data of a selected period in August 2003 (3 to 27 August). This was done for 27 Austrian gauging stations in the glacierized basins of the rivers Inn, Salzach and Drau {{with a degree of}} glaciation between 2 and 76 %. The quotient qA 03 was calculated between 0. 63 and 1. 82, which means for the lower value that only 63 % of the long-term mean August runoff and for the higher value 82 % more than the long-term mean August runoff was observed in 2003. Additionally two stations at river Danube (0. 4 and 1 % glacierized) and further six gauging stations in catchments with no glacier cover were investigated to define qA 03 quotients for non-glacierized basins. These qA 03 quotients were calculated between 0. 31 and 0. 54. Hence, it was possible to qualitatively visualize the decreasing impact of glacier melt for a decreasing degree of glaciation. Nevertheless, for the accurate calculation of the glacier melt contribution for a certain catchment scale and time a glaio-hydrological model is needed...|$|R
40|$|This paper quantifies the {{contribution}} of glacier melt to river runoff from compilation and statistical interpretation of data from available studies based on observations or glacio- hydrological modelling for the region of Austria (Austrian Salzach and Inn river basin). A logarithmic fit between the glacier melt contribution and the relative glacierized area was found {{not only for the}} long-term mean glacier contributions but also for the glacier melt contribution during the extreme hot an dry summer of 2003. Interestingly, the mean contributions of glacier melt to river runoff do not exceed 15 % for both river catchments and are uncorrelated to glacierization for glacierization values > 10 %. This finding, however, has to be seen {{in the light of the}} general precipitation increase with altitude for the study region which levels out the increase of absolute melt with glacierization thus resulting in the rather constant value of glacier melt contribution. In order to qualitatively proof this finding another approach has been applied by calculating the quotient qA 03 of the <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> August <b>runoff</b> in 2003 and the long-term mean August runoff for 38 gauging stations in Austria. The extreme summer 2003 was worth to be analysed as from the meteorological and glaciological point of view an extraordinary situation was observed.

The qA 03 quotients were calculated between 0. 32 for a non-glacierized and 2. 0 for a highly glacierized catchment. Using the results of this study the mean and maximum possible glacier melt contribution of catchments can be estimated based on the relative glacierized area. It can also be shown that the found correlation of glacierized area and glacier melt contribution is applicable for the Drau basin where yet no results of modelled glacier melt contributions are available...|$|R
40|$|This work aims to {{evaluate}} {{the performance of a}} hydrological balance model in a watershed located in northern Tunisia (wadi Sejnane, 378 km 2) in present climate conditions using input variables provided by four regional climate models. A modified version (MBBH) of the lumped and single layer surface model BBH (Bucket with Bottom Hole model, in which pedo-transfer parameters estimated using watershed physiographic characteristics are introduced) is adopted to simulate the water balance components. Only two parameters representing respectively the water retention capacity of the soil and the vegetation resistance to evapotranspiration are calibrated using rainfall-runoff data. The evaluation criterions for the MBBH model calibration are: relative bias, mean square error and the ratio of mean actual evapotranspiration to mean potential evapotranspiration. Daily air temperature, rainfall and runoff observations are available from 1960 to 1984. The period 1960 – 1971 is selected for calibration while the period 1972 – 1984 is chosen for validation. Air temperature and precipitation series are provided by four regional climate models (DMI, ARP, SMH and ICT) from the European program ENSEMBLES, forced by two global climate models (GCM) : ECHAM and ARPEGE. The regional climate model outputs (precipitation and air temperature) are compared to the observations in terms of statistical distribution. The analysis was performed at the seasonal scale for precipitation. We found out that RCM precipitation must be corrected before being introduced as MBBH inputs. Thus, a non-parametric quantile-quantile bias correction method together with a dry day correction is employed. Finally, simulated runoff generated using corrected precipitation from the regional climate model SMH is found the most acceptable by comparison with runoff simulated using observed precipitation data, to reproduce the temporal variability of <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff.</b> The SMH model is the most accurate to reproduce the occurrence of dry days but still underestimates them. From the statistical distribution point of view, corrected SMH precipitation data introduced into the MBBH model were not able to reproduce extreme runoff values generated by observed precipitation data during validation (larger than 80 mm/month). This {{may be due to the}} SMH weakness in reproducing moderate and high rainfall levels even after bias correction. This approach may be considered as a way to use regional climate models (RCM) model outputs for studying hydrological impacts...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} {{of climate change}} impacts on hydrology is subject to uncertainties related to the climate change scenarios, stochastic uncertainties of the hydrological model and structural uncertainties of the hydrological model. This paper focuses on the contribution of structural uncertainty of hydrological models to the overall uncertainty of the climate change impact assessment. To quantify the structural uncertainty of hydrological models, four physically based hydrological models (SWAT, PRMS and a semi- and fully distributed version of the WetSpa model) are set up for a catchment in Belgium. Each model is calibrated using four different objective functions. Three climate change scenarios with a high, mean and low hydrological impact are statistically perturbed from a large ensemble of climate change scenarios and are used to force the hydrological models. This methodology allows assessing and comparing the uncertainty introduced by the climate change scenarios with the uncertainty introduced by the hydrological model structure. Results show that the hydrological model structure introduces a large uncertainty on both the average monthly discharge and the extreme peak and low flow predictions under the climate change scenarios. For the low impact climate change scenario, the uncertainty range of the <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> {{is comparable to the}} range of these runoff values in the reference period. However, for the mean and high impact scenarios, this range is significantly larger. The uncertainty introduced by the climate change scenarios is larger than the uncertainty due to the hydrological model structure for the low and mean hydrological impact scenarios, but the reverse is true for the high impact climate change scenario. The mean and high impact scenarios project increasing peak discharges, while the low impact scenario projects increasing peak discharges only for peak events with return periods larger than 1. 6 years. All models suggest for all scenarios a decrease of the lowest flows, except for the SWAT model with the mean hydrological impact climate change scenario. The results {{of this study indicate that}} besides the uncertainty introduced by the climate change scenarios also the hydrological model structure uncertainty should be taken into account in the {{assessment of}} climate change impacts on hydrology. To make it more straightforward and transparent to include model structural uncertainty in hydrological impact studies, there is a need for hydrological modelling tools that allow flexible structures and methods to validate model structures in their ability to assess impacts under unobserved future climatic conditions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comparative}} analysis of projected impacts {{of climate change}} on river runoff from two types of distributed hydrological model, a global hydrological model (GHM) and catchment-scale hydrological models (CHM). Analyses are conducted for six catchments that are global in coverage and feature strong contrasts in spatial scale as well as climatic and development conditions. These include the Liard (Canada), Mekong (SE Asia), Okavango (SW Africa), Rio Grande (Brazil), Xiangu (China) and Harper's Brook (UK). A single GHM (Mac-PDM. 09) is applied to all catchments whilst different CHMs are applied for each catchment. The CHMs typically simulate water resources impacts based on a more explicit representation of catchment water resources than that available from the GHM, and the CHMs include river routing. Simulations of average annual runoff, <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> and high (Q 5) and low (Q 95) monthly runoff under baseline (1961 - 1990) and climate change scenarios are presented. We compare the simulated runoff response of each hydrological model to (1) prescribed increases in global mean temperature from the HadCM 3 climate model and (2) a prescribed increase in global-mean temperature of 2 oC for seven GCMs to explore response to climate model and structural uncertainty. We find that differences in projected changes of mean annual runoff between {{the two types of}} hydrological model can be substantial for a given GCM, and they are generally larger for indicators of high and low flow. However, they are relatively small in comparison to the range of projections across the seven GCMs. Hence, for the six catchments and seven GCMs we considered, climate model structural uncertainty is greater than the uncertainty associated with the type of hydrological model applied. Moreover, shifts in the seasonal cycle of runoff with climate change are presented similarly by both hydrological models, although for some catchments the monthly timing of high and low flows differs. This implies that for studies that seek to quantify and assess the role of climate model uncertainty on catchment-scale runoff, it may be equally as feasible to apply a GHM as it is to apply a CHM, especially when climate modelling uncertainty across the range of available GCMs is as large as it currently is. Whilst the GHM is able to represent the broad climate change signal that is represented by the CHMs, we find, however, that for some catchments there are differences between GHMs and CHMs in mean annual runoff due to differences in potential evaporation estimation methods, in the representation of the seasonality of runoff, and in the magnitude of changes in extreme monthly runoff, all of which have implications for future water management issues...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAccording to {{historical}} observed {{data for the}} runoff into the Poyang Lake, the analysis of runoff into the Poyang Lake about 50 years was conducted. The {{results showed that the}} five rivers runoff for the influx into the Poyang Lake, were decreased since 2002, and the runoff decline phenomenon like this has appeared in the 60 's and 80 's. About the runoff annual distribution, the uneven distribution was detected. The sum of the <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> from April to July account for 46 %∼ 69 % about the entire year, and in the dry season, the sum of the <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> from October to next year January only account for 12 %∼ 23 %. About the each <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> series of the five rivers from 1956 to 2008, it was observed that during the flood season the dispersion coefficient of the series is small, and in the non-flood season the dispersion coefficient of the series is bigger. It illuminated that the <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> series were changer in the non-flood than the flood season and the increased human activities may be the major factor...|$|R
40|$|EXTRACT (SEE PDF FOR FULL ABSTRACT) : We {{estimate}} <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> for a 2 -dimensional solution domain containing {{those areas}} tributary to Pyramid Lake, Nevada (the Truckee River drainage basin) at a 1 -kilometer grid cell spacing. [...] . To calculate {{the effect of}} snow on the hydrologic system, we perform two experiments. In the first we assume that all precipitation falls as rain; in the second we assume that some precipitation falls as snow, thus available water is a combination of rain and snowmelt. We find that considering the effect of snow results in a more accurate representation of <b>mean</b> <b>monthly</b> flow rates, in particular the peak flow during the melt season in the Sierra Nevada. These preliminary results indicate that a relatively simple snow model can improve the representation of Truckee River basin hydrology, significantly reducing errors in modeled seasonal runoff...|$|R
40|$|Runoff {{potentiality}} of {{a watershed}} was assessed based on identifying curve number (CN), soil conservation service (SCS), and functional data analysis (FDA) techniques. Daily discrete rainfall {{data were collected}} from weather stations in the study area and analyzed through lowess method for smoothing curve. As runoff data represents a periodic pattern in each watershed, Fourier series was introduced to fit the smooth curve of eight watersheds. Seven terms of Fourier series were introduced for the watersheds 5 and 8, while 8 terms of Fourier series were used {{for the rest of the}} watersheds for the best fit of data. Bootstrapping smooth curve analysis reveals that watersheds 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8 are with <b>monthly</b> <b>mean</b> <b>runoffs</b> of 29, 24, 22, 23, 26, and 27 [*]mm, respectively, and these watersheds would likely contribute to surface runoff in the study area. The purpose of this study was to transform runoff data into a smooth curve for representing the surface runoff pattern and mean runoff of each watershed through statistical method. This study provides information of runoff potentiality of each watershed and also provides input data for hydrological modeling...|$|R
40|$|River runoff is an {{essential}} climate variable as it is directly linked to the terrestrial water balance and controls {{a wide range of}} climatological and ecological processes. Despite its scientific and societal importance, there are to date no pan-European observation-based runoff estimates available. Here we employ a recently developed methodology to estimate <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> rates on regular spatial grid in Europe. For this we first assemble an unprecedented collection of river flow observations, combining information from three distinct data bases. Observed <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> rates are first tested for homogeneity and then related to gridded atmospheric variables (E-OBS version 12) using machine learning. The resulting statistical model is then used to estimate <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> rates (December 1950 - December 2015) on a 0. 5 ° x 0. 5 ° grid. The performance of the newly derived runoff estimates is assessed in terms of cross validation. The paper closes with example applications, illustrating the potential of the new runoff estimates for climatological assessments and drought monitoring...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of actual}} {{evapotranspiration}} derived by satellite data at watershed scale in water balance modelling of forested mountainous watersheds is studied. <b>Mean</b> <b>monthly</b> maximum composites of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), {{derived from the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) / Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) were correlated with monthly actual evapotranspiration rates estimated by a water balance model. The water balance model was applied to three mountainous and forested watersheds of Central Thessaly in Greece and the actual basin-wide evapotranspiration was estimated using two methods for the estimation of basin wide precipitation and two methods of potential evapotranspiration. The derived values of actual evapotranspiration were then correlated to NDVI data, and the developed equations were validated temporally and spatially. The actual evapotranspiration estimates, derived from NDVI and used in the water balance model, resulted in equally accurate simulations of <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> {{when compared with the}} simulations acquired from the classical application of water balance model...|$|R
40|$|Water {{resources}} {{assessment in}} China, {{can be classified}} into three groups: (i)  comprehensive water resources assessment, (ii)  annual water resources assessment, and (iii)  industrial project water resources assessment. Comprehensive water resources assessment is the conventional assessment where the frequency distribution of water resources in basins or provincial regions are analyzed. For the annual water resources assessment, water resources {{of the last year}} in basins or provincial regions are usually assessed. For the industrial project water resources assessment, the water resources situation before the construction of industrial project has to be assessed. To address the climate and environmental changes, hydrological and statistical models are widely applied for studies on assessing water resources changes. For the water resources prediction in China usually the <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> prediction is used. In most low flow seasons, the flow recession curve is commonly used as prediction method. In the humid regions, the rainfall-runoff ensemble prediction (ESP) has been widely applied for the <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> prediction. The conditional probability method for the <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> prediction was also applied to assess next month runoff probability under a fixed initial condition...|$|R
40|$|Simulations {{with seven}} {{regional}} climate models {{driven by a}} common control climate simulation of a GCM carried out for Europe {{in the context of}} the (European Union) EU-funded Prediction of Regional scenarios and Uncertainties for Defining European Climate change risks and Effects (PRUDENCE) project were analyzed with respect to land surface hydrology in the Rhine basin. In particular, the annual cycle of the terrestrial water storage was compared to analyses based on the 40 -yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA- 40) atmospheric convergence and observed Rhine discharge data. In addition, an analysis was made of the partitioning of convergence anomalies over anomalies in runoff and storage. This analysis revealed that most models underestimate the size of the water storage and consequently overestimated the response of runoff to anomalies in net convergence. The partitioning of these anomalies over runoff and storage was indicative for the response of the simulated runoff to a projected climate change consistent with the greenhouse gas A 2 Synthesis Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). In particular, the annual cycle of runoff is affected largely by the terrestrial storage reservoir. Larger storage capacity leads to smaller changes in both wintertime and summertime <b>monthly</b> <b>mean</b> <b>runoff.</b> The sustained summertime evaporation resulting from larger storage reservoirs may have a noticeable impact on the summertime surface temperature projections...|$|R

The <b>monthly</b> <b>runoff</b> series is firstly decomposed to sub-series on different time scales, and each sub-series is modeled. The weights of the network are replaced by wavelet functions and are corrected by conjugate gradient method in the training iteration.
