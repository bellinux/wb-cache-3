The sale of <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> stopped 16 January 2008 and <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> stopped being accepted in late 2008, making the Moscow metro the world's first major public-transport system to run exclusively on a contact-less automatic fare-collection system.|$|R
25|$|The first desktop {{programmable}} calculators {{were produced}} in the mid-1960s by Mathatronics and Casio (AL-1000). These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the HP-65, in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> reader. Two years later the HP-25C introduced continuous memory, i.e., programs and data were retained in CMOS memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first alphanumeric, programmable, expandable calculator, the HP-41C. It could be expanded with random access memory (RAM, for memory) and read-only memory (ROM, for software) modules, and peripherals like bar code readers, microcassette and floppy disk drives, paper-roll thermal printers, and miscellaneous communication interfaces (RS-232, HP-IL, HP-IB).|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a move away from {{traditional}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>card,</b> stamp, or punchcard based schemes to online and mobile online loyalty programs. While these schemes vary, the common element is a push toward eradication of a traditional card, in favour of an electronic equivalent. The choice of medium is often a QR code. Some prominent examples are Austrian based mobile-pocket est 2009, the US-based Punchd (discontinued from June 2013), which became part of Google in 2011. and also an Australian-based loyalty card application called Stamp Me which incorporates iBeacon technology. Others, like Perka (US), Loyalli (UK), QR Loyalty Cards (CA), and Loopy Loyalty (HK) have offered similar programs. Passbook by Apple is the first attempt to standardize the format of mobile loyalty cards.|$|E

Rama also made a profile of John McAreavey whom he claim is very intelligent, John said that he was on his phone while waiting for the victim but his phone was not even analyse by the police, there was 117 contradictions in statements given by John including the times, John is not favorable to a second autopsy which could be crucial, the footage of the CCTV cameras was deleted.|$|E

Belgarric et al. propose a scenario where mobile payments are performed with bitcoin transactions.
