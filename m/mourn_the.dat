5|$|By {{what right}} do you dare accuse the nation of... want of {{perseverance}} in the emperor's interest? The nation has followed him on the fields of Italy, across the sands of Egypt and the plains of Germany, across the frozen deserts of Russia.... The nation has followed him in fifty battles, in his defeats and in his victories, {{and in doing so}} we have to <b>mourn</b> <b>the</b> blood of three million Frenchmen.|$|E
5|$|Do I wish I {{had never}} endured post-partum depression? Absolutely. But {{to deny the}} {{experience}} is to deny who I am. I still <b>mourn</b> <b>the</b> loss of what could have been, but I also feel deep gratitude for those who stood by me, for the lesson that we must never be afraid to ask for help, and for the feeling of summer that still remains.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} after the war, veterans, the {{bereaved}} {{and the rest of}} society focused, to the point of obsession, with the problem of death. There was tremendous interest in creating war memorials that celebrated the themes of glory, heroism and loss. In part, there was a rupture or dislocation with the pre-war norms of how memorials should look and feel; communities sought to find new, radical ways to <b>mourn</b> <b>the</b> millions of dead, killed in an essentially modern conflict. In other ways, the building of memorials drew on traditional forms and ideas, drawing on existing religious and architectural themes to explore loss and grief.|$|E
5|$|The three legions in Pannonia (VIII Augusta, XIX Hispana, and XV Apollinaris) {{were under}} the command of Junius Blaesus, who allowed his men a rest from {{military}} duties to <b>mourn</b> <b>the</b> death of Augustus. There was a breakdown in discipline, and the soldiers stopped obeying orders as a result. They soon became restless and lashed out against their officers, including Blaesus and a centurion named Aufidienus Rufus. Having been dispatched with two Praetorian cohorts, Drusus and Praetorian prefect Sejanus reached the Pannonian legions at Emona on 26 September.|$|E
5|$|Having worked {{together}} for communist {{organizations in the}} mid-1980s, Faeq al-Mir and Elias Atallah boasted a close relationship {{at the time of}} the arrest. Al-Mir, a human rights activist, led the left-wing People’s Democratic Party, an unauthorized party critical of the Syrian government. Atallah was the leader and sole parliamentarian of the Democratic Left Movement, a leftist Lebanese party. He was also a senior figure in the March 14 Alliance, a Lebanese parliamentary coalition critical of Syrian policies. The two conversed over the phone several times prior to the arrest. They often lamented the assassinations of anti-Syrian Lebanese figures like Samir Kassir. Al-Mir, who was released from a previous ten-year prison sentence related to political activism in 1999, visited Lebanon in 2006 to <b>mourn</b> <b>the</b> killing of George Hawi, a former leader of the Lebanese Communist Party. According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, this contributed to al-Mir's arrest at the end of the year.|$|E

25|$|In October 2005, Deng {{published}} an autobiographical work entitled Twelve Years (1975-1987) in limited circulation in Hong Kong, which recounted {{his role in}} the major political events during that period. In reviewing the book, dissident journalist Gao Yu accused him of glorifying himself at the expense of Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. Despite their erstwhile political rivalry, Deng sent wreaths to <b>mourn</b> <b>the</b> death of both Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang.|$|E
25|$|Upon Frigg's entreaties, {{delivered}} {{through the}} messenger Hermod, Hel promised to release Baldr from the underworld if all objects alive and dead would weep for him.

Thus Baldr had {{to remain in the}} underworld, not to emerge until after Ragnarök, when he and his brother Höðr would be reconciled and rule the new earth together with Thor's sons.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (Halichos Sh'lomo 3:179–180) {{suggests}} that the Fast of the Firstborn incorporates the second purpose mentioned above; firstborns fast to <b>mourn</b> <b>the</b> loss of their priestly status (see Numbers 3:40–51) which had initially been granted them on the fourteenth of Nisan (ibid. 3:14). Furthermore, during the Temple period, this loss was most profoundly felt on the fourteenth of Nisan, which was the busiest {{day of the year}} for the Temple priests and Levites (see Pesachim 58a).|$|E

25|$|Baqella nifro (boiled broad beans) are eaten as a snack {{during some}} {{holidays}} and {{during a time}} of mourning. Interestingly, this tradition goes well into religious holidays, too. On the Thursday before Good Friday, in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church tradition tselote hamus (the Prayer of Thursday), people eat a different kind of nifro called gulban. Gulban is made of peeled, half beans collected and well cooked with other grains such as wheat, peas and chickpeas. This is done to <b>mourn</b> <b>the</b> crucifixion of Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|The Torah in Deuteronomy ch. 21:10-14 {{allows the}} taking of a female captive only {{within the context of}} marriage. The female captive must be brought to the home and, {{following}} the month in which she is given to <b>mourn,</b> <b>the</b> man must decide to either take her as a wife or set her free. According to Rabbi Yohanan in the Jerusalem Talmud, only after deciding to marry the female captive are sexual relations permitted. This in effect prohibits rape in the process of war, but does not prohibit forced marriages and marital rape.|$|E
