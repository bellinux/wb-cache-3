25|$|In most {{film and}} radio adaptations of the story, Bombadil is notable by his absence (an {{exception}} is the Mind's Eye recordings). Peter Jackson stated that the reason the character was omitted from his film was because, in the view him and his co-writers, Bombadil does little to advance the story, and would make their film unnecessarily long. Christopher Lee concurred, stating the scenes were left out to <b>make</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> showing Saruman's capture of Gandalf.

25|$|Physical {{activity}} is body movement that works your muscles and requires {{more energy than}} resting. According to a blog by the American Intercontinental University, college students should <b>make</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> exercise to maintain and increase motivation. AIU states that regular exercise has impeccable effects on the brain. With consistent running routines, there are more complex connections between neurons, meaning the brain is able to access its brain cells more flexibly. By performing well physically, motivation will be present in education because of how well the brain is performing. After exercising, the brain can have more desire to obtain knowledge and better retain the information. In addition, exercise can relieve stress. Exercising can ease anxiety and relieve negative effects of stress on the body. Without stress factors, individuals can perform better and more efficiently, since their minds will have a more positive outlook. This positive mood will help keep students motivated and more open and willing to succeed academically. Lastly, exercise increases focus and concentration that could also help students maintain their motivation and focus on their studies. AIU claims that exercise may have improved the students' ability to participate and retain information during the class after they had exercised. Being able to retain information and being willing to participate keeps students motivated and performing well academically.|$|E

25|$|After {{the defeat}} on the Marne, Moltke ordered a {{retirement}} to the Aisne by the 1st and 2nd armies on the German right wing and a withdrawal to Reims {{and a line}} eastwards past the north of Verdun, by the 3rd, 4th and 5th armies. The 6th and 7th armies were ordered to end their attacks and dig in. The withdrawal was intended to <b>make</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the 7th Army to be transferred from Alsace, to the right wing near the Oise but Franco-British attacks led to the 7th Army being sent {{to fill the gap}} between the 1st and 2nd armies instead. Moltke was replaced by Falkenhayn on 14 September, by when the 1st Army had reached the Aisne, with its right flank on the Oise and the 7th Army had assembled on the Aisne, between the 1st and 2nd armies. Further east the 3rd, 4th and 5th armies had dug in from Prosnes to Verdun, secure from frontal attacks. The 1st Army was still vulnerable on its northern flank, to attacks by French troops transferred from the south, which could be moved faster over undamaged railways, than German troops using lines damaged during the Great Retreat. General Wilhelm Groener, head of the Railway Department of the OHL, suggested three alternatives, a frontal attack from the new positions, a defence of the line of the Aisne while reserves were transferred to the right flank or to continue the withdrawal and comprehensively regroup the German armies, ready to conduct an offensive on the right flank.|$|E

Braun also had her own apartment at the new Reich Chancellery in Berlin, completed to a design by Albert Speer.|$|E
500|$|In {{one scene}} of [...] "A Trip to the Dentist", Weevil (Francis Capra) accuses Logan (Jason Dohring) of having hit Lilly during their relationship. The series' writers were {{planning}} to develop that plot strand into a storyline, with it eventually being revealed that Duncan had hit Lilly in an epileptic fit. However, the storyline was abandoned in order to <b>make</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> other story arcs. Thomas commented, [...] "At {{the end of the}} day, I don't want people thinking that Logan hit Lilly. I did, however, want Weevil to believe it." [...] Although Veronica concludes in this episode that she had consensual sex with Duncan while they were both under the influence of roofies, more information about the night is later revealed in the show's second season finale, [...] "Not Pictured", in which it is revealed that Cassidy [...] "Beaver" [...] Casablancas raped her. When asked whether the writers knew that Beaver would be eventually revealed as the rapist when writing [...] "A Trip to the Dentist", Thomas responded, [...] "I wish I could claim that we were that clever." [...] The writers realized that there was a moment in the episode's script where Beaver could have raped Veronica roughly a month after its airing.|$|E

500|$|Manga, anime, video-game {{and related}} media {{publications}} have praised and criticized the character. Sheena McNeil {{of the online}} magazine Sequential Tart liked Allen's design, calling his anti-Akuma weapon [...] "quite impressive" [...] in visually represents his strength. According to McNeil, the combination of his cursed left eye and his white hair make him [...] "much more striking". Anime News Network's Casey Brienza also praised his design, saying that {{he looks like a}} [...] "visual kei rock star" [...] and calling him [...] "a nice change of pace" [...] from other shōnen protagonists. Allen's abilities were described as [...] "rather inspired" [...] by Michael Aronson in Manga Life magazine. Brian Henson of Mania Beyond Entertainment wrote that Allen's mysterious, cursed eye might appeal to series readers. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network wrote that Allen did not use [...] "cleverness" [...] to defeat Akuma, letting his arm [...] "overpower the enemy". Allen was described as a [...] "solid" [...] hero by A.E. Sparrow of IGN. Writing that the character's use of the anti-Akuma weapon might seem clichéd, Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk found its anime depiction entertaining. Like Casey Brienza, Kevin Leathers of the UK Anime Network noted that Allen differed from the genre's typical main characters. Leathers saw little character development: [...] " [...] is focused on his job, but will always <b>make</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> his friends, which while different, isn't interesting {{over a long period of}} time." [...] Tom Tonhat of Escapist magazine called Allen a [...] "good lead character". Active Anime's Sandra Scholes found him mysterious, citing his arrival at the Black Order and the anti-Akuma weapon.|$|E
500|$|Similar fossils were {{reported}} in 1902 from nearby Mount Field, {{another part of the}} Stephen formation. These may have been why Charles Doolittle Walcott visited Mount Field in 1909. While taking photographs there Walcott found a slab of fossils that he described as [...] "Phyllopod crustaceans". From late August to early September 1909, his team, including his family, collected fossils there, and in 1910 Walcott opened a quarry that he and his colleagues re-visited in 1911, 1912, 1913, 1917 and 1924, bringing back over 60,000 specimens in total. Walcott was Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution from 1907 to his death in 1927, and this kept him so busy that he was still trying to <b>make</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> analyzing his finds two years before his death. Although he drew attention to the exceptional detail of the specimens, which were the first known fossils of soft-bodied animals from the Cambrian period, he also had other research interests: the Early Paleozoic stratigraphy of the Canadian Rockies, which took up the great majority of his time there; and Precambrian fossils of algae and bacteria, to which he assigned as much importance as to the fossils of animals. He managed to publish four [...] "preliminary" [...] papers on the fossil animals in 1911 and 1912, and further articles in 1918, 1919 and 1920. Four years after Walcott's death his associate Charles Resser produced a package of additional descriptions from Walcott's notes. Walcott's classifications of most of the fossils are now rejected, but were supported at the time, and he accepted a change for one of the few where his conclusion was disputed. Many of the later comments were made with the benefits of hindsight, and of techniques and concepts unknown in Walcott's time.|$|E
