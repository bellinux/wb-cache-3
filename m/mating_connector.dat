The terminals easily can be re-used in the field, allowing for the replacement of wires or equipment, generally with standard hand tools. Screw terminals usually avoid the requirement for a specialized <b>mating</b> <b>connector</b> to be applied to the ends of wires.|$|E

50|$|The term {{jackscrew}} is {{also used}} for the captive screws that draw the two parts of D-subminiature electrical connectors together and hold them mated. When unscrewed, they allow the connector halves to be taken apart. These small jackscrews may have ordinary screw heads or extended heads (also making them thumbscrews) that allow the user's fingers to turn the jackscrew. Furthermore, the head sometimes has an internal female thread, with the male externally threaded screw shaft extending from that. The threaded-head type {{can be used to}} panel-mount one connector and provide a means to attach the <b>mating</b> <b>connector</b> to the first connector.|$|E
50|$|The {{processor}} in the ECU is an Intel AN87C196KD {{running at}} 12 MHz and featuring 8KB of on-chip ROM for storage of code and data and 232 bytes of general-purpose RAM. The main connector is a 36-pin TE Connectivity 344108 ("Econoseal"), and its <b>mating</b> <b>connector</b> (used in the wiring harness) is a TE Connectivity 344111. On {{earlier versions of}} the system, a MAP sensor was internal to the ECU, requiring that an inlet manifold vacuum line be run to the ECU enclosure. In MEMS 1.6, this MAP sensor is the Motorola 5141550T02, and the vacuum line feeding it passes through a vapor trap to prevent admission of fuel vapor into the ECU.|$|E

5000|$|An M.2 module is {{installed}} into a <b>mating</b> <b>connector</b> {{provided by the}} host's circuit board, and a single mounting screw secures the module into place. Components may be mounted {{on either side of}} the module, with the actual module type limiting how thick the components can be; the maximum allowable thickness of components is 1.5 mm per side. Different host-side connectors are used for single- and double-sided M.2 modules, providing different amounts of space between the M.2 expansion card and the host's PCB. [...] Circuit boards on the hosts are usually designed to accept multiple lengths of M.2 modules, which means that the sockets capable of accepting longer M.2 modules usually also accept shorter ones by providing different positions for the mounting screw.|$|E

40|$|About 730 BPMs {{are mounted}} on the RHIC CQS and Triplet super-conducting magnets. Semi-rigid coaxial cables are used to bring the {{electrical}} signal from the BPM feedthroughs to the outside flanges. at the ambient temperature. Every year around 10 cables will lose their signals during the operation. The connection usually failed at the warm end of the cable. The problems were either the solder joint failed or the center conductor retracted out of the SMA connector. Finite element analyses were performed to understand the failure mechanism of the solder joint. The results showed that (1) The SMA center conductor can separate from the <b>mating</b> <b>connector</b> due to the thermal retraction. (2) The maximum thermal stress at the warm end solder joint can exceed the material strength of the Pb 37 /Sn 63 solder material and (3) The magnet ramping frequency (- 10 Hz), during the machine startup, can possibly resonant the coaxial cable and damage the solder joints, especially when a fracture is initiated. Test results confirmed that by using the silver bearing solder material (a higher strength material) and by crimping the cable at the locations close to the SMA connector (to prevent the center conductor from retracting) can effectively resolve the connector failure problem...|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} {{deleterious}} mechanically induced modulation is speckle noise created in a multimode fiber by an imperfect splice or imperfectly <b>mated</b> <b>connectors.</b> Mechanical disturbance of the fiber {{ahead of the}} joint will introduce changes in the modal structure, resulting in variations of joint loss.

40|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{tool for}} safely separating one multipin electrical connector from another is presented. The separation tool {{consists of a}} master cylinder which operates a pair of slave cylinders. Each slave cylinder has a corresponding operative shaft and an extraction tab. The slave cylinders are spaced apart from one another {{so that they may}} be positioned on either side of <b>mated</b> <b>connector</b> pairs of different sizes and so that their extraction tabs may be slid between the connectors. When the master cylinder's plunger is operated, its operation is hydraulically transmitted to the operative shafts of the slave cylinders which extend outward and, once pressed against a substrate, causes the slave cylinders and corresponding extractor tabs to move away and separate one connector from the other. A second preferred separation tool includes an additional pair of extractor tabs, one {{at the end of each}} operative shaft, so that the tool can be used to separate a <b>mated</b> <b>connector</b> pair hanging in free space...|$|R

40|$|A {{proposed}} tool {{would be}} used to inspect alignments of mating twinaxial-connector assemblies on interconnecting wiring harnesses. More specifically, the tool {{would be used}} to inspect the alignment of each contact pin of each connector on one assembly with the corresponding socket in the corresponding connector on the other assembly. It is necessary to inspect the alignment because if mating of the assemblies is attempted when any pin/socket pair is misaligned beyond tolerance, the connection will not be completed and the dielectric material in the socket will be damaged (see Figure 1). Although the basic principle of the tool is applicable to almost any type of <b>mating</b> <b>connector</b> assemblies, the specific geometry of the tool must match the pin-and-socket geometry of the specific mating assemblies to be inspected. In the original application for which the tool was conceived, each of the mating assemblies contains eight twinaxial connectors; the pin diameter is 0. 014 in. (. 0. 35 mm), and the maximum allowable pin/socket misalignment is 0. 007 in. (. 0. 18 mm). Incomplete connections can result in loss of flight data within the functional path to the space shuttle crew cockpit displays. The tool (see Figure 2) would consist mainly of a transparent disk with alignment clocking tabs that can be fitted onto either connector assembly. Sets of circles or equivalent reference markings are affixed to the face of the tool, located at the desired positions of the mating contact pairs. An inspector would simply fit the tool onto a connector assembly, engaging the clocking tabs until the tool fits tightly. The inspector would then align one set of circles positioning a line of sight perpendicular to one contact within the connector assembly. Mis alignments would be evidenced by the tip of a pin contact straying past the inner edge of the circle. Socket contact misalignments would be evidenced by a crescent-shaped portion of the white dielectric appearing within the circle. The tool could include a variable magnifier plus an illuminator that could be configured so as not to cast shadows...|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} tubes, {{like the}} Deforest Spherical Audion from c. 1911, used the typical light bulb Edison socket for the heater, and flying leads {{for the other}} elements. Other tubes directly used flying leads for all of their contacts, like the Cunningham AudioTron from 1915, or the Deforest Oscillion. Type C6A xenon thyratrons, used in servos for the U.S. Navy Stable Element Mark 6, had a mogul screw base and L-shaped stiff wires at the top for grid and anode connections. <b>Mating</b> <b>connectors</b> were machined pairs of brass blocks with clamping screws, attached to flying leads (free hanging).|$|R

These connections transferred anode positive voltage (typically 600 VDC for Heathkit, 800 VDC for Collins), grid negative bias (-130 VDC), 6.3 and 12.6 VAC for heaters (filaments), and control functions (remote mains switching).|$|R
40|$|Humans {{are able}} to pump gas into a car {{with little or no}} difficulty. This task is {{characterized}} by two sources of force: that from the nozzle contacting the car and that from the hose attached to the pump. The task succeeds due to the appreciable skill of a human and a forgiveness in the connection. The robotic <b>mating</b> of <b>connectors</b> burdened by forces from sources like the gas hose is beyond the current state of art. The research presented in this dissertation develops technology for robots to <b>mate</b> <b>connectors</b> that concurrently experience appreciable forces from encumbrances, like those from hoses, cables and oscillating masses, in addition to forces from contact. Effective force guided assembly under the influence of these bias forces, requires the differentiation of contact forces from bias forces, a task that is impossible using traditional sensing configurations.
