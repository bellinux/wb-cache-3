25|$|In 1940, Sister Elizabeth Kenny, an Australian bush nurse from Queensland, {{arrived in}} North America and {{challenged}} {{this approach to}} treatment. In treating polio cases in rural Australia between 1928 and 1940, Kenny had developed a form of physical therapy that—instead of immobilizing afflicted limbs—aimed to relieve pain and spasms in polio patients {{through the use of}} hot, moist packs to relieve <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> and early activity and exercise to maximize the strength of unaffected muscle fibers and promote the neuroplastic recruitment of remaining nerve cells that had not been killed by the virus. Sister Kenny later settled in Minnesota where she established the Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute, beginning a world-wide crusade to advocate her system of treatment. Slowly, Kenny's ideas won acceptance, and by the mid-20th century had become the hallmark for the treatment of paralytic polio. In combination with antispasmodic medications to reduce muscular contractions, Kenny's therapy is still used in the treatment of paralytic poliomyelitis.|$|E

Williams had to record a come-from-behind win after being whitewashed in the first set and saving two match points in the second. Williams played for her country in the Fed Cup {{for the first time since}} 2003 in a tie against Belgium. Williams won her opening match, but withdrew from her second, because of a knee injury. At the French Open, Williams lost in the quarterfinals to Henin. During her fourth round match against Hantuchová at Wimbledon, Williams collapsed from an acute <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm</b> at 5–5 in the second set. After a medical timeout and holding serve to force a tiebreak, rain forced play to be suspended for nearly two hours. When the players returned, Williams won the match in three sets. Williams then lost her quarterfinal match with Henin, whilst suffering from the injuries sustained in the previous round. At the US Open, Williams lost her third consecutive Grand Slam singles quarterfinal to Henin. Williams reached the final of Kremlin Cup, losing to Elena Dementieva. Williams qualified for the WTA Championships, but retired from her first match with Anna Chakvetadze with a knee injury and subsequently withdrew from the tournament. Williams finished 2007 as world No. 7 and the top-ranked American for the first time since 2003.|$|E

2500|$|Vaginismus, {{sometimes}} called vaginism, {{is a condition}} that affects a woman's ability to engage in vaginal penetration, including sexual intercourse, manual penetration, insertion of tampons or menstrual cups, and the penetration involved in gynecological examinations (pap tests). This {{is the result of}} an involuntary vaginal <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm,</b> which makes any kind of vaginal penetration painful or impossible. While {{there is a lack of}} evidence to definitively identify which muscle is responsible for the spasm, the pubococcygeus muscle, sometimes referred to as the [...] "PC muscle", is most often suggested. Other muscles such as the levator ani, bulbocavernosus, circumvaginal, and perivaginal muscles have also been suggested.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{ancient times}} in Western Europe, women could be {{medically}} {{diagnosed with a}} disorder called female hysteria, the symptoms of which included faintness, nervousness, insomnia, fluid retention, heaviness in abdomen, <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm,</b> shortness of breath, irritability, loss of appetite for food or sex, and [...] "a tendency to cause trouble". Women considered suffering from the condition would sometimes undergo [...] "pelvic massage" [...] — stimulation of the genitals by the doctor until the woman experienced [...] "hysterical paroxysm" [...] (i.e., orgasm).

2500|$|Although most of {{the drugs}} derived from {{bacteria}} are employed as anti-infectives, some have found use in other fields of medicine.

[...] Newer trends in the field include the metabolic profiling and isolation of natural products from novel bacterial species present in underexplored environments. [...] Examples include symbionts or endophytes from tropical environments, subterranean bacteria found deep underground via mining/drilling, and marine bacteria.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) leads to {{permanent}} motor and sensory deficits {{due to the}} damage of ascending and descending fiber tracts. In addition, malfunctions such as neuropathic pain or <b>muscle</b> <b>spasms</b> develop in many patients, possibly caused by injury-induced plastic changes of neuronal circuits {{above and below the}} lesion. New treatment strategies for spinal cord injury aim at enhancing plasticity and neurite growth, for example, by blocking the key neurite growth inhibitor Nogo-A or its downstream effectors. It is therefore crucial to investigate potential effects of such treatments on malfunctions such as <b>muscle</b> <b>spasms.</b> In addition, locomotor training, now a standard therapeutic tool to improve walking ability in incomplete SCI subjects, can be expected to influence the rearrangement of spinal cord circuits and the development of <b>muscle</b> <b>spasms</b> and other malfunctions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we present and validate a new rat model for <b>muscle</b> <b>spasms</b> after incomplete SCI and show that both intrathecal anti-Nogo-A antibody treatment and locomotor training, started early after injury, permanently reduce the development of <b>muscle</b> <b>spasms.</b> INTERPRETATION: The results show that an antibody-mediated suppression of the growth inhibitory protein Nogo-A leads to functional recovery and a lower level of malfunctions, suggesting the formation of functionally meaningful connections in the damaged spinal cord. Treadmill training early after SCI also has a beneficial effect...|$|R

2500|$|While, {{in ancient}} times, the vagina was often {{considered}} equivalent (homologous) to the penis, with anatomists Galen (129 AD– 200 AD) and Vesalius (1514–1564) regarding the organs as structurally the same {{except for the}} vagina being inverted, anatomical studies over latter centuries showed the clitoris to be the penile equivalent. Another perception of the vagina was that the release of vaginal fluids would cure or remedy a number of ailments; various methods were used over the centuries to release [...] "female seed" [...] (via vaginal lubrication or female ejaculation) {{as a treatment for}} suffocation ex semine retento (suffocation of the womb), green sickness, and possibly for female hysteria. Methods included a midwife rubbing the walls of the vagina or insertion of the penis or penis-shaped objects into the vagina. Supposed symptoms of female hysteria included faintness, nervousness, insomnia, fluid retention, heaviness in abdomen, <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm,</b> shortness of breath, irritability, loss of appetite for food or sex, and [...] "a tendency to cause trouble". It may be that women who were considered suffering from the condition would sometimes undergo [...] "pelvic massage" [...] — stimulation of the genitals by the doctor until the woman experienced [...] "hysterical paroxysm" [...] (i.e., orgasm). In this case, paroxysm was regarded as a medical treatment, and not a sexual release. The categorization of female hysteria has ceased to be recognized as a medical condition since the 1920s.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms of a {{herniated disc}} can vary {{depending}} on the location of the herniation and the types of soft tissue that become involved. They can range from little or no pain if the disc is the only tissue injured, to severe and unrelenting neck or lower back pain that will radiate into the regions served by affected nerve roots that are irritated or impinged by the herniated material. Often, herniated discs are not diagnosed immediately, as the patients come with undefined pains in the thighs, knees, or feet. Other symptoms may include sensory changes such as numbness, tingling, [...] paresthesia, and motor changes such as muscular weakness, paralysis and affection of reflexes. If the herniated disc is in the lumbar region the patient may also experience sciatica due to irritation of one of the nerve roots of the sciatic nerve. Unlike a pulsating pain or pain that comes and goes, which can be caused by <b>muscle</b> <b>spasm,</b> pain from a herniated disc is usually continuous or at least is continuous in a specific position of the body. It is possible to have a herniated disc without any pain or noticeable symptoms, depending on its location. If the extruded nucleus pulposus material doesn't press on soft tissues or nerves, it may not cause any symptoms. A small-sample study examining the cervical spine in symptom-free volunteers has found focal disc protrusions in 50% of participants, which suggests that a considerable part of the population can have focal herniated discs in their cervical region that do not cause noticeable symptoms.|$|E
