The monument's stones at the base are five feet by eight feet and weigh thousands of pounds each. The pyramid narrows from the base to become progressively smaller towards the top at a ratio of four inches to the foot.|$|E
25|$|Viewed {{from the}} {{entrance}} gate, which is facing west, it is in curved shape, and appears like the backside of an elephant and hence the style is termed gajapristha (back of an elephant). To add to this epithet, a large sized elephant sculpture, a monolithic sculpture, is carved next to the ratha. The ratha is classified under the vasara style. This <b>monolithic</b> <b>structure,</b> {{along with the other}} Pancha Rathas, opposite to the Arjuna Ratha, was built out of a single rock outcrop of granite. It is an apsidal (horseshoe-shaped) dvitala (two tiered) free standing structure, entirely of Dravidian architecture. It is built on the same base, {{at the end of the}} three rathas of Dharmaraja, Bhima and Arjuna, but facing south. There are no idols to worship inside the ratha. The walls of this ratha also have features arranged in a sequence to delineate the “projections and recesses created by pairs of shallow pilasters.” The niches on the interior walls of the ratha have carved images of gods and demi-gods. The roof (in the form of the back of an elephant) terminates as a pyramid or finial or shikara, which is carved with motifs. The unusual architecture of this ratha is said to be an innovation of the architect.|$|E

500|$|The shallow {{coffering}} in {{the dome}} {{accounts for a}} less than five percent reduction in the dome's mass, and is mostly decorative. The aggregate material hand-placed in the concrete is heaviest {{at the base of}} the dome and changes to lighter materials as the height increases, dramatically reducing the stresses in the finished structure. In fact, many commentators have cited the Pantheon as an example of the revolutionary possibilities for monolithic architecture provided by the use of Roman pozzolana concrete. However, vertical cracks seem to have developed very early, such that in practice the dome acts as an array of arches with a common keystone, rather than as a single unit. The exterior step-rings used to compress the [...] "haunches" [...] of the dome, which would not be necessary if the dome acted as a <b>monolithic</b> <b>structure,</b> may be an acknowledgement of this by the builders themselves. Such buttressing was common in Roman arch construction. The cracks in the dome can be seen from the upper internal chambers of the rotunda, but have been covered by re-rendering on the inner surface and by patching on the outside. The Pantheon's roof was originally covered with gilt bronze tiles, but these were removed in 663 by Emperor Constans II and replaced with lead roofing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Machining {{of large}} <b>monolithic</b> <b>structures</b> is {{standard}} practice in today’s aerospace world. Driven by cost and performance, {{it is becoming}} necessary for airframe manufacturers to machine parts better, faster, lighter, and cheaper than ever before. When machining these large <b>monolithic</b> <b>structures,</b> however, distortion becomes a significant problem. The typical {{solution to this problem}} is to machine with lower than optimum material removal rates, and perform additional fixture rotations – both of which add unnecessary time and cost to the manufacturing process. A finite element model has been developed specifically to predict and control these distortions. The model takes into consideration the machining-induced residual stresses, as well as the bulk stresses in the material from the manufacturer...|$|R

2500|$|The J. Edgar Hoover Building is a {{low-rise}} {{office building}} located at 935 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., in the United States. It is {{the headquarters of}} the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Planning for the building began in 1962, and a site was formally selected in January 1963. Design work, focusing on avoiding the typical blocky, <b>monolithic</b> <b>structure</b> typical of most federal architecture at the time, began in 1963 and was largely complete by 1964 (although final approval did not occur until 1967). Land clearance and excavation of the foundation began in March 1965; delays in obtaining congressional funding meant that only the three-story substructure was complete by 1970. Work on the superstructure began in May 1971. These delays meant that the cost of the project grew to $126.108 million from $60 million. [...] Construction finished in September 1975, and President Gerald Ford dedicated the structure on September 30, 1975.|$|E
