25|$|The {{invention}} of the cavity magnetron made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength (microwaves). The magnetron was originally a crucial component {{in the development of}} short wavelength radar during World War II. In 19371940, a multi-cavity magnetron was built by the British physicist Sir John Turton Randall, FRSE, together with a team of British coworkers, for the British and American military radar installations in World War II. A more high-powered <b>microwave</b> <b>generator</b> that worked at shorter wavelengths was needed, and in 1940, at the University of Birmingham in England, Randall and Harry Boot produced a working prototype. They invented a valve that could spit out pulses of microwave radio energy on a wavelength of 10cm, an unprecedented discovery.|$|E

Unsuccessful with this, he asked for assistance from Paul-Günther Erbslöh and Hans-Karl Freiherr von Willisen, amateur radio operators who were developing a VHF system for communications.

To perform practical quantum computation, on-chip microwave generators, {{which can be}} controlled by single flux quantum (SFQ) circuits, are desirable because multiple qubits can be driven simultaneously with high accuracy by an SFQ control circuit {{and the number of}} wires between qubits and room-temperature electronics can be reduced.

Simulation results indicate that the generated microwave has a sharp spectrum, which can be chopped by controlling the SFQ clock generator. Moreover, a phase of the generated microwave can be accurately controlled by adding a phase control circuit, which is composed of cascaded toggle flip-flops, between the SFQ clock generator and the filter.
