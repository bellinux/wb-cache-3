40|$|This paper {{argues that}} an early 20 th century central banker, {{had he been}} alive {{at the turn of}} the 21 st century, would have {{predicted}} the 2007 - 08 crisis and its severity. This paper is Part II of a series which contends that early 20 th century banking theory is a valuable framework for understanding the relationship between banks, financial markets, and the central bank. This paper builds on Part I which explained that because a social norm supports the circulation of bank deposits as money, deposits are a network good and this makes possible <b>monetary</b> <b>finance,</b> or the expansion of the money supply as a source of funds for banks to lend. This paper first analyses the British model of <b>monetary</b> <b>finance,</b> the structured interaction of banks, the money market, and the central bank that formed its core, and the means by which this structure made possible the origination of safe, privately-issued assets. Then, the analysis turns to the macroeconomic implications of monetary finance: in order to protect the monetary social norm, both financial instability and inflation must be avoided. The real bills principle addressed the former by proscribing <b>monetary</b> <b>finance</b> of long-term assets and the latter by requiring careful monitoring and control of the growth of money market instruments that were not real bills. Thus, the modern integration of money and capital markets is seen through traditional banking theory to be a recipe for financial instability, because it undermines the ability of banks and the money market to be joined together in the production of safe, privately-issued assets. This theory indicates that restabilizing the financial system will require structural reform and that only after such reform has been implemented can we expect macro-prudential regulation to succeed...|$|R

50|$|The German Constitutional Court made a {{preliminary}} reference, asking whether the OMT decision was compatible with TFEU articles 119 and 127, on the ECB’s mandate, and TFEU article 123 which prohibits <b>monetary</b> <b>financing</b> of member state budgets. The purchase of government bonds was an economic not a monetary measure because (1) its {{objective was to}} neutralise spreads of government bonds (2) it selectively purchased bonds of member states, while monetary policy {{was meant to be}} uniform (3) it was related to financial rescue of member states, so was functionally equivalent. OMT was intended to circumvent art 123(1), which prohibits providing overdraft facilities. Under the Honeywell standard, the OMT decision would manifestly exceed EU competence, bringing about a structural shift in the balance of competences, unless interpreted restrictively.|$|E
50|$|According to the Court, if the OMT {{decision}} is {{to qualify as}} an independent act of economic policy it violates the distribution of powers. It is structurally significant because it is equivalent to financial assistance without safeguards. Rescue programmes, owing to ‘their significant financial scope and general political implications, belong to the core aspects of the Member States’ economic policy responsibilities.’ Without parliamentary approval, the OMT did away with national democratic process. OMT was structurally significant by redistributing between budgets of member state taxpayers, and so was fiscal redistribution contrary to TFEU art 125. The prohibition of <b>monetary</b> <b>financing</b> of the budget {{is one of the}} fundamental rules that guarantee the design of the monetary union as a ‘community of stability’ and safeguards the overall budgetary responsibility of the German Bundestag. The OMT could be rescued, by restrictive interpretation, by (1) excluding any acceptance of a debt cut (2) not permitting purchase of an unlimited amount of bonds (3) avoiding interference with price formation on the market.|$|E
5000|$|The OMT {{decision}} {{has also been}} challenged in the German Federal Constitutional Court {{by members of the}} German Bundestag, including German politician Peter Gauweiler, and by the German political party Die Linke. The German Constitutional Court requested a preliminary ruling from the European Court of Justice (ECJ) concerning the compatibility of the OMT decision with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Case C-62/14). In its request for a preliminary ruling, the German Constitutional Court expressed doubts about the legality of OMT under German and EU law. In January 2015, an Advocate General Opinion stated that the programme is in principle compatible with Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. ECJ made its final ruling of the case in June 2015, declaring the conditional [...] "OMT program" [...] to be legal, as it due to its attached conditions [...] "does not exceed the powers of the ECB in relation to monetary policy and does not contravene the prohibition of <b>monetary</b> <b>financing</b> of EU nations".|$|E

5000|$|According to De Grauwe, {{none of the}} {{arguments}} is valid for the following reason: (1) The money stock does not necessarily increase if the money base is increased. (2) All open market operations generate taxpayer risk, and if the lender of last resort is successful in preventing countries from moving into the bad equilibrium, it will not suffer any losses. (3) The risk of moral hazard {{is identical to the}} moral hazard in the financial market and should be overcome by risk-limiting regulation. (4) If the distinction between illiquid and insolvent were possible, the market would not need the support of the lender of last resort, but in practice, the distinction cannot be made. (5) While Article 21 of the treaty prohibits buying debt from national governments directly because it [...] "implies a <b>monetary</b> <b>financing</b> of the government budget deficit," [...] Article 18 allows the ECB to buy and sell [...] "marketable instruments," [...] and government bonds are marketable instruments. Finally, De Grauwe asserts that only the central bank itself has the necessary credibility to act as a lender of last resort and so it should replace the European Financial Stability Facility (and its successor, the European Stability Mechanism).

40|$|Historically {{high levels}} of private and public debt coupled with already very low {{short-term}} interest rates appear to limit the options for stimulative monetary policy in many advanced economies today. One option {{that has not yet}} been considered is <b>monetary</b> <b>financing</b> by central banks to boost demand and/or relieve debt burdens. We find little empirical evidence to support the standard objection to such policies: that they will lead to uncontrollable inflation. Theoretical models of inflationary <b>monetary</b> <b>financing</b> rest upon inaccurate conceptions of the modern endogenous money creation process. This paper presents a counter-example in the activities of the Bank of Canada during the period 1935 - 75, when, working with the government, it engaged in significant direct or indirect <b>monetary</b> <b>financing</b> to support fiscal expansion, economic growth, and industrialization. An institutional case study of the period, complemented by a general-to-specific econometric analysis, finds no support for a relationship between <b>monetary</b> <b>financing</b> and inflation.

Sustainable debt growth may require the tax burden to rise above some socially acceptable level.

However, their persistence {{after more than a decade}} raises the question of why these differentials are so difficult to eliminate.

This increases the difficulty of achieving the convergence of monetary policies and inflation rates required for irrevocably fixed exchange rates in Europe.

40|$|As well as {{implementing}} the common monetary policy, the {{national central banks}} (NCBs) which, together with the European Central Bank (ECB) form the Eurosystem, are also responsible for performing a range of national tasks. Among other things, these include the management of their financial assets portfolios. To ensure that this function does {{not interfere with the}} implementation of the single monetary policy, the Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA) limits the total net amount of financial assets (NFA) the NCBs are permitted to hold. National central bank purchases of government bonds under ANFA have led to public accusations that this was tantamount to covert <b>monetary</b> <b>financing</b> of fiscal deficits through the "printing press" by the national central banks. The present report first explains the Agreement on NetFinancial Assets and shows the volume of securities purchased by the different NCBs under ANFA. Based on this, it examines {{the extent to which the}} accusation of <b>monetary</b> <b>financing</b> may be justified. Although there have been indications of certain national banks increasing the government bond holdings on their balance sheets in recent years, this does not provide sufficient evidence of <b>monetary</b> <b>financing.</b> However, the public debate on ANFA clearly highlights the Eurosystem's lack of transparency, particularly that of the NCBs.

From a legal perspective, the no-bailout rule and the ban on <b>monetary</b> <b>financing</b> constitute the main principles governing the legality review of financial assistance and liquidity measures.

According to conventional legal doctrine, bond spreads only depend on the country’s debt position, largely ignoring other causal factors including liquidity.

We find evidence that {{a significant part of}} the surge in the spreads of the peripheral Eurozone countries was disconnected from underlying fundamentals and particularly from a country’s debt position, and was associated rather strongly with market sentiments and liquidity concerns. We apply our empirical findings to the legal principles as interpreted by recent jurisprudence arguing that application of the no-bailout principle and the ban on <b>monetary</b> <b>financing</b> should be extended to capture non-debt related factors. Also, the empirical results suggest taking recourse to alternative legal grounds for reviewing the legality of anti-crisis instruments and allowing for a lender of last resort in the euro zone...|$|E
