25|$|I {{said nothing}} to my brothers. But I went {{immediately}} to the show and took <b>my</b> <b>painting</b> home in a taxi. It was really {{a turning point in}} my life, I can assure you. I saw that I would not be very much interested in groups after that.|$|E
25|$|<b>My</b> <b>painting</b> {{does not}} come from the easel. I prefer to tack the unstretched canvas to the hard wall or the floor. I need the {{resistance}} of a hard surface. On the floor I am more at ease. I feel nearer, more part of the painting, since this way I can walk around it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting.|$|E
25|$|When I am in <b>my</b> <b>painting,</b> I'm {{not aware}} of what I'm doing. It is only after a sort of 'get acquainted' period that I see what I have been about. I have no fear of making changes, {{destroying}} the image, etc., because the painting has {{a life of its}} own. I try to let it come through. It is only when I lose contact with the painting that the result is a mess. Otherwise there is pure harmony, an easy give and take, and the painting comes out well.|$|E

But I {{perceive}} I must {{explain to you}} the action of <b>my</b> <b>paint.</b> A broken bone is a mighty small affair at the worst of it; and it belongs to a class of accident to which <b>my</b> <b>paint</b> is quite inapplicable. Sin, my dear young friend, sin is the sole calamity that a wise man should apprehend; it is against sin that I have fitted you out; and {{when you come to}} be tempted you will give me news of my paint." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s {{until her death}} in 2002, Howard {{returned}} to her lifelong fascination with light, night skies, the reflective surface of water. In these last paintings, there is a recurrence of circular elements, an abstraction of natural forms and a balancing of darkness and light. [...] Howard has stated: [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>painting</b> (as in all my work) I am deeply involved with light as the movement and inter-action of colours; the integrity of colour and form, hence with {{the integrity of the}} total work which has to do with spirit and abstract essence, not representation. I am preoccupied with life's ambiguities and dualities and in my later work I am reaching more and more from the dark toward light, freedom, and a transcending exuberance." ...|$|E
500|$|Whistler {{exhibited}} it at {{the small}} Berners Street Gallery in London instead, where it was shown under the title The Woman in White, {{a reference to the}} novel of that name by Wilkie Collins, which was a popular success at the time. The book was a tale of romance, intrigue and double identity, and was considered a bit of a sensation {{at the time of its}} publication. Du Maurier apparently believed that the painting referred to the novel. The review in the Athenaeum complained that painting did not correspond to the character in the novel, propmpting Whistler to write a letter asserting that the gallery chose the title without consulting him, adding [...] "I had no intention whatsoever of illustrating Mr Wilkie Collins' novel. <b>My</b> <b>painting</b> simply represents a girl dressed in white standing in front of a white curtain." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{preparatory studies}} exist. Two {{drawings}} in the Louvre evidence an initially circular composition, a tondo like The Turkish Bath that Chassériau's teacher Ingres would paint in 1862. Such experiments underscore Chassériau's desire to find original motifs, {{as he wrote}} alongside a drawing at the time: [...] "....Put...the history...of {{the world in a}} new way...allowing one to see these beautiful things once again by presenting them in a fresh manner. May 1841. For <b>my</b> <b>painting</b> Esther preparing her toilette". The lush accessories and overall coloring owe something to Chassériau's admiration for Eugène Delacroix.|$|E

40|$|<b>Painting</b> <b>my</b> body frees it {{from the}} limits of reality. My body exists in a collaged state between man and woman, human and animal, {{abstract}} and figurative. By embracing my body’s power as an object, it isn’t limited to being a representation of myself. <b>My</b> <b>painted</b> body can be owned or identified with. It can be feared, hated, and lusted after. I submit my body, blasting it with horror, humor, and a sheer sense of enjoyment...|$|R

2500|$|Soon after {{painting}} The Maze, Kurelek {{was transferred}} to Netherne Hospital. While {{under the care of}} Edward Adamson, [...] "the father of art therapy in Britain," [...] Kurelek continued to produce more masterpieces, several of which are still in the Adamson Collection. However, it was not the science of the doctors that led to his eventual recovery. Describing his walks on the Netherne grounds, he writes, [...] "I walked and walked, going round and round in the labyrinth of my mind just as that rat in <b>my</b> <b>painting.</b> If the doctors didn’t seem able or interested in untangling the snarl, then I, at least, should do and try everything in my power before giving up." [...] A year after painting The Maze, Kurelek attempted suicide.|$|E
2500|$|He {{said that}} she had not {{previously}} done a painting in that way and that [...] "Her painting of Princess Diana was based on the same idea as <b>my</b> <b>painting</b> Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision [...] namely to imagine what a famous person is thinking and write the words next to a portrait of them. She has made an intelligent, innovative and personal interpretation of influences to form her own identity, which is what all artists do. It is only fair and honest to acknowledge there was this help and there has been an influence." [...] Vine refutes the idea that Thomson and the Stuckists had any role to play in her development, citing her inspiration instead as Sophie von Hellerman, Elizabeth Peyton, Anna Bjerger, Karen Kilimnik and Paul Housley ...|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{incident}} Duchamp later recalled, [...] "I {{said nothing to}} my brothers. But I went immediately to the show and took <b>my</b> <b>painting</b> home in a taxi. It was really {{a turning point in}} my life, I can assure you. I saw that I would not be very much interested in groups after that." [...] Yet Duchamp did appear in the illustrations to Du [...] "Cubisme", he participated in the La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House), organized by the designer André Mare for the Salon d'Automne of 1912 (a few months after the Indépendants); he signed the Section d'Or invitation and participated in the Section d'Or exhibition during the fall of 1912. The impression is, Brooke writes, [...] "it was precisely because he wished to remain part of the group that he withdrew the painting; and that, far from being ill treated by the group, he was given a rather privileged position, probably through the patronage of Picabia".|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought things out. I believe I'm {{through with}} the Impressionists; I've got an idea they'll seem very thin and {{superficial}} in a few years. I {{want to make a}} clean sweep of everything I've learnt and start fresh. When I came back I destroyed everything I'd painted. I've got nothing in my studio now but an easel, <b>my</b> <b>paints,</b> and some clean canvases." ...|$|R
5000|$|On August 12, 2016, in {{an article}} {{published}} by Today, it was revealed that the album's song [...] "Head Over High Heels" [...] contains a lyrical reference to British singer-songwriter Adele ("I put on my tight dress, hair piled on <b>my</b> head, <b>painting</b> <b>my</b> lips red and my eyes like Adele.").|$|R
5000|$|... "I use a {{fluid and}} fast brush stroke. <b>My</b> <b>paints</b> are wet. I draw while I paint like Soutine did. As I {{get caught up}} in a painting, {{there seems to be a}} {{chemical}} change--I feel a shortness of breath, an excitement. This is the exuberance of creativity. It is passionate, impulsive. Sometimes I should stop. My body cries out, 'Stop, stop,' but I say, 'No, no, I cannot stop." ...|$|R

Madonna references Basquiat in the song [...] "Graffiti Heart" [...] from the super deluxe edition of her album Rebel Heart. The band Fall Out Boy used the Basquiat crown {{as a part of}} their logo in 2013. It is still being used. Robb Bank$ compares himself thoroughly to Basquiat in his song [...] "Look like Basquiat". Basquiat was referenced in the Gym Class Heroes' song, [...] "To Bob Ross with Love". Hip-hop artist Yasiin Bey released a song dedicated to Basquiat, titled [...] "Basquiat Ghostwriter". Bey says he was inspired by the paintings and writings of the artist.|$|E

6000|$|He gently rubbed one long-fingered {{hand over}} the other until there fell a lull in the {{conversation}} around us. [...] "What I mix <b>my</b> <b>paints</b> with, Miss M.? Why--merely with brains," [...] he replied. My old novelist had forgotten the brains. But I discovered in some book or other long afterwards that a still more celebrated artist had said that too; so I suppose the mot is traditional.|$|R
6000|$|Stanton and Flo {{had come}} on to places beside her. The young man laughed. [...] "Wal, now Miss Carley, you couldn't say more.

6000|$|... "Why," [...] {{said the}} physician, [...] "I {{perceive}} I must {{explain to you}} {{the nature of the}} action of <b>my</b> <b>paint.</b> It does not exactly prevent sin; it extenuates instead the painful consequences. It is not so much for this world as for the next; it is not against life; in short, it is against death that I have fitted you out. And when you come to die, you will give me news of my paint." ...|$|R

6000|$|In the {{attitude}} of Madame Recamier in the picture, I reclined on a lustrous spread of crimson satin and rabbit-skin draped over a small lump of wood for bolster to give support to my elbow. And out of <b>my</b> <b>paint</b> and powder, from amid this oasis--and with repeated warnings [...] "not to touch" [...] screamed by my gipsy--I met as pleasantly and steadily as I could {{the eyes of the}} grinning, smirking, awestruck faces--townsfolk and village folk, all agape and all sound Kentish stock.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perfectly," [...] said Hans, {{turning his}} face into a good-humored smile. [...] "You have the very justifiable opinion of me that I am likely to shatter all the glass in my way, and break my own skull into the bargain. Quite fair. Since I got into the scrape of being born, {{everything}} I have liked best has been a scrape either for myself or somebody else. Everything I have taken to heartily has somehow turned into a scrape. <b>My</b> <b>painting</b> is the last scrape; and I shall be all my life getting out of it. You think now I shall get into a scrape at home. No; I am regenerate. You think I must be over head and ears in love with Mirah. Quite right; so I am. But you think I shall scream and plunge and spoil everything. There you are mistaken--excusably, but transcendently mistaken. I have undergone baptism by immersion. Awe takes care of me. Ask the little mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|My young lady's eighteenth {{birthday}} was the birthday now coming, on the twenty-first of June. If {{you happen to}} like dark women (who, I am informed, {{have gone out of}} fashion latterly in the gay world), and if you have no particular prejudice in favour of size, I answer for Miss Rachel as one of the prettiest girls your eyes ever looked on. She was small and slim, but all in fine proportion from top to toe. To see her sit down, to see her get up, and specially to see her walk, was enough to satisfy any man in his senses that the graces of her figure (if you will pardon me the expression) were in her flesh and not in her clothes. Her hair was the blackest I ever saw. Her eyes matched her hair. Her nose was not quite large enough, I admit. Her mouth and chin were (to quote Mr. Franklin) morsels for the gods; and her complexion (on the same undeniable authority) was as warm as the sun itself, with this great advantage over the sun, that it was always in nice order to look at. Add to the foregoing that she carried her head as upright as a dart, in a dashing, spirited, thoroughbred way--that she had a clear voice, with a ring of the right metal in it, and a smile that began very prettily in her eyes before it got to her lips--and there behold the portrait of her, to the best of <b>my</b> <b>painting,</b> as large as life! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{there is}} no saying as to who will come back again tomorrow, Mary, and I {{want you to see}} my two pictures. I have been working at them for the last two months steadily. They are not quite {{finished}} yet, but another week would have been enough for the finishing touches, but I don't suppose you will miss them. Nobody has seen them yet, and nobody would have seen them till they were quite ready, but as it is possible they never may be finished I should like you to see them now. I am not taking you up under any false pretences," [...] he said, lightly, [...] "nor to try again to get you to change your mission. I only want you to see that I have been working honestly. I could see when I have spoken of <b>my</b> <b>painting</b> there was always a little incredulity {{in the way in which}} you listened to me. You had so completely made up your mind that I should never be earnest about anything that you could not bring yourself to believe that I wasn't amusing myself with art here, just as I did in London. I had intended to have brought them triumphantly in a fiacre to your place, when they were finished, and I can't deny myself the pleasure of disabusing your mind. It is not far out of your way, and if we walk fast you can still arrive at your ambulance in time. If there were any fiacres about I would call one, but they have quite disappeared. In the first place, because no one is rich enough to be able to pay for such luxuries, and in the second, because most of the horses have been turned to other uses." ...|$|E
