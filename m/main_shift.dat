5000|$|The Literary Consultancy was {{established}} in 1996 by its founding Director Rebecca Swift (1964-2017), together with Hannah Griffiths (who {{went on to become}} Publisher at Faber & Faber). While working as an editorial assistant at Virago Press, Swift realised the need for a professional editorial consultancy where writers could send manuscripts for assessment before they approached publishers and agents. As she explains:"I felt that ... many more people were writing, as new technology made it easier than ever for people to want to put their stories down, yet the publishing environment was becoming more difficult than ever.... Editors were shed from the industry in large numbers, and editing was in some companies considered a time-wasting exercise! This is a crude generalisation, and of course all good publishers still have excellent editors working for them, but the <b>main</b> <b>shift</b> from editorially led buying to sales team buying, changed the flavour of publishing radically. ...there were so many good editors on the freelance market, and so many people writing who needed an opinion on their work. TLC was the first to establish itself in Britain, and to remove the stigma of people paying for editorial opinion and advice. After all, editing is a real skill, knowing the markets is another skill, and in my view people writing should consider paying for these skills—rather than expecting serious feedback for free.|$|E

50|$|On Saturday March 19, 1904, a fire {{broke out}} in the Welsh Shaft at a {{position}} ten fathoms below the surface. The incident was of particular significance as a similar outbreak of fire in the Great Snaefell Mine in 1897, resulted in the deaths of 19 miners.Prior to the <b>main</b> <b>shift</b> commencing work, a party of men had descended the Welsh Shaft in order to inspect the joints of the steam pumps which had been put into the mine in order to assist in purging water, and which were found to be satisfactory. Following this over 100 men entered the mine to begin work. At approximately 07:00hrs the boiler man at the Welsh Shaft picked up the smell of burning wood and promptly raised the alarm. Arranged signals were then used to alert those in the mine to evacuate, and in less than 30 minutes all the men were accounted for. The position of the fire was traced to a point 33 fathoms down, a hose was brought and water pumped down to the level. Several men volunteered to descend to the level, where they found hot pieces of rock falling from the roof of the shaft. To avert the risk of a possible heavy rock fall from the vicinity of the shaft choking up the shaft below the adit, heavy timber was placed across the pit, and deflected a further fall {{as a result of the}} fire.Water continued to be poured down the mouth of the shaft, being effective in putting out the fire, enabling men to directly extinguish the smoldering timbers and make secure the sides of the shaft.|$|E

40|$|Excessive {{intake of}} dietary fat {{is known to}} be a {{contributing}} factor in the development of obesity. In this study, we determined the dose-dependent effects of dietary fat on the development of this metabolic condition with a focus on changes in gene expression in the small intestine. C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed diets with either 10, 20, 30 or 45 energy % (E%) derived from fat for four weeks (n = 10 mice/diet). We found a significant higher weight gain in mice fed the 30 E % and 45 E% fat diet compared to mice on the control diet. These data indicate that the <b>main</b> <b>shift</b> towards an obese phenotype lies between a 20 E % and 30 E % dietary fat intake. Analysis of differential gene expression in the small intestine showed a fatdose dependent gradient in differentially expressed genes, with the highest numbers in mice fed the 45 E % fat diet. The <b>main</b> <b>shift</b> in fat-induced differential gene expression was found between the 30 E % and 45 E % fat diet. Furthermore, approximately 70 % of the differentially expressed genes were changed in a fat-dose dependent manner. Many of these genes were involved in lipid metabolism-related processes and were already differentially expressed on a 30 E % fat diet. Taken together, we conclude that up to 20 E % of dietary fat, the small intestine has an effective ‘buffer capacity ’ for fat handling. From 30 E % of dietary fat, a switch towards an obese phenotype is triggered. We further speculate that especiall...|$|E

The mechanism of hysteria is presumed to be psychogenic, while catatonia has always been considered to be among the most organic syndromes in psychiatry.

40|$|For most of {{the twentieth}} century, pessimism about, and hostility to, markets was {{prevalent}} and this pulled in an anti-globalist direction. Indeed, the global institutions set up in 1944 were constructed by two market pessimists, John Maynard Keynes, on whom this article concentrates, and Harry Dexter White. The <b>main</b> <b>shift</b> in thinking in our own day has been towards a renewal of the market optimism of the nineteenth century, providing the necessary intellectual condition {{for the emergence of}} globalisation as a policy project. Anti-globalism has switched from poor to rich countries. Globalisation offers the best hope for poor countries {{to catch up with the}} rich. But growth has become less important for rich countries which could probably abandon the globalist project without much damage to their material standards, and with possible gain to their quality of life. And they may be tempted to do so if the political costs of maintaining a global economy become too high. The implications of such a shift are profound. But Keynes would at least demand that we start thinking about them. ...|$|E

Since most videos are about people, this work has focused on the analysis of human motion. In this paper, I present my perspective on understanding human behavior.

Significant {{progress has been made in}} human tracking over the last few years. As compared with tracking, not much progress has been made in understanding human behavior, and the issue of representation has largely been ignored.

Following stylized facts, it is shown that the <b>main</b> <b>shifts</b> in the Greek economy occurred outside industry (from agriculture to services). Also, industrialization was a hesitant process evolving slowly and reaching a plateau in 1950 - 73. Three structural continuities that accompanied this progress have been a large state sector, the commercial character of Greek entrepreneurship and the incomplete transition from a mercantile/family to corporate capitalism. Also, a rising share of manufacturing in GDP related consistently with increasing per capita income, improving trade performance and ‘trading up’ efforts within manufacturing. ...|$|R

40|$|A Geographical Information System (GIs) -supported {{method was}} {{developed}} for predicting the spatial distri- bution of soil wetness as an indicator to determine the probability of an area {{to act as a}} groundwater recharge or discharge area. The method was based on overlays of maps with the distribution of hydrological determining factors. An application was made for the river basin (south-central Sweden). Changes in the soil-wetnessmosaic due to human activities were also analyzed. Since the 1870 s drainage and forestry had, according to the analysis, decreased by 5 % the parts of the basin that act as discharge areas during wet spells. In the agriculturally dominated sub-basins, the alterations were larger. Forty percent of the open land had been artificially drained. The <b>main</b> <b>shift</b> of soil wetness index classes was caused by an alteration of areas that earlier fluctuated between groundwater discharge and recharge into typical recharge areas. For the plains, the shift from discharge areas to recharge areas was also significant. A conceptual water partitioning model was used to assess the spatial distribution of water flows (evaporation and recharge), as a response to climatic inputs, for areas with different physiographic and vegetative characteristics. The present water flow pattern was compared with the response mosaic of the 1870 s. The increased maximum daily recharge peaks during autumn constitute the only significant change in the hydrological response for the studied area as a whole. The consequencesthat the desiccation of the landscape have on chemical and biological processes were discussed...|$|E
