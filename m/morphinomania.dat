The most important biologic effects of this sort of pain plays on patients' psychosociality. This is in reference to the quality of pain, the amount of pain and to the character of the patients. Actually, pain only in appearance is presented as a symptom; it is usually a disease. Patient assessment, the use of anticancer therapies and systematically administered non-opioid and opioid analgesics are pivotal. Practical aspects of cancer pain treatment include both drug selection, method of analgesic administration: selection of the appropriate route, dose titration and an understanding of the management of side effects. Pain therapy includes another series of possibilities like the use of adjuvant analgesics, psychological therapies, physiatric techniques and invasive interventions {{such as the use of}} intraspinal drugs, neural blockade and neuroablative techniques. This kind of therapy must be employed at all times, whether the case may be resolved surgically or not. So we think that pain can be effectively treated. This study was carried out to obtain the correct therapeutic approach for facial cancer pain syndrome. The research was performed on seven women and thirteen men with a mean age of 58 years. All the patients' clinical appearances were standardized with care. Study participants included odontostomatologists and anesthesiologists with experience of controlling cancer pain. The sensation of pain was quantified by means of the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) while their psychosocial ability was assessed with the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS). In this way the authors hoped to obtain a good quality of standardization. The study was performed for a period of two months. The conclusions are that Trans Epidermis Nervous Stimulation (TENS) offers positive results for variable periods and only in 60 % of patients with a low level of pain. The use of antiphlogistic non-steroid drugs and of opioid drugs, with a particular management requested from the personal clinical status of each patient, result as being the most effective therapeutic resource. Such therapies must be employed, whether the case may be resolved surgically or not. Nevertheless it is necessary to realize that drugs or other therapies for cancer pain are independent and propaedeutic to each surgical approach. Finally, the use of opioids is addressed in the management of patients with pain that is refractory to other interventions. This approach can provide adequate relief to the vast majority of patients. We find the <b>morphinomania</b> risk in cancer pain patients is not scientifically wellfounded. PMID: 917321...|$|E
