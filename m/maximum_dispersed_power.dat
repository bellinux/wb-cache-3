40|$|International audienceThe <b>dispersing</b> <b>power</b> of {{different}} phosphonic acid (PA) surfactants on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was examined: benzylphosphonic acid (BPA), hexylphosphonic acid (HPA) and decylphosphonic acid (DPA). UV-vis absorbance, {{transmission electron microscopy}} and zeta potential were employed to characterize the dispersion of MWCNTs in the aqueous phase. Among the three surfactants, DPA provided maximum dispersion stability while BPA and HPA provided minimum dispersion stability. We have shown that there exists an optimum weight ratio of surfactant to MWCNT of 1. 5 - 1 for the effective dispersion of MWCNTs. The-potential values of the DPA-nanotube dispersion increased as the DPA concentration increased to reach a maximum value of- 62 mV. The long hydrophobic chain of DPA was found to {{play a central role}} for the formation of stable MWCNT dispersions. The DPA-modified MWCNTs dispersions were used for the preparation of waterborne anticorrosive coatings. DPA-modified MWCNTalkyd coatings offers better corrosion protection to steel compared with the surfactant-free coating. The positive effect of DPA on the anticorrosion performance of MWCNT-alkyd coatings was related to its <b>dispersing</b> <b>power</b> on MWCNT and to its corrosion inhibitive properties.

Individual <b>dispersed</b> <b>power</b> source systems, such as photovoltaic system and housing micro cogeneration system, is considered as one of systems which enable to save energy for housing.

40|$|Leadership in the post-incorporation English Further Education {{system has}} not been {{distributed}} in nature, but transactional, driven by the external demands of funding and inspection regimes. There is, however, {{in light of the}} current rhetoric of localism in Further Education policy, a view that distributed leadership would be an appropriate alternative form of leadership within this context. This paper reviews the education literature, and argues that distributed leadership should be introduced to the sector but that this, on its own, will be insufficient for addressing the government’s agenda of meeting the human capital needs of businesses, needs-based equity for disadvantaged adults or the wider benefits of education. This is because distributed leadership, whilst involving a dispersion of responsibility, may not equate to a dispersion of <b>power.</b> To <b>disperse</b> <b>power</b> to local areas, and to facilitate an authentic distributed leadership focused on local stakeholders a policy of localism is needed which encourages self-governance and open systems, and flexible accountability arrangements which encourage strategy and leadership at the local level.

40|$|The project mainly {{seeks to}} explain the {{structural}} logic behind the welfare expansion trend in three developed East Asian democraciesâKorea, Japan, and Taiwanâsince 1990. The major finding of the research is that the <b>dispersed</b> <b>power</b> structure (e. g. coalition, minority, divided governments) was a hitherto unnoticed significant political factor behind the transformation of fragmented, indirect, and weak welfare benefits into universal, direct, and generous ones. Unlike the conventional approach using welfare expenditure data in analysing welfare politics, the project examined possible relations between the changes in power structure and the legislative activities of major political actors using the whole universe of billsâroughly 50, 000 in totalâin three nations {{during the past two}} decades. Among others, the research focused on how dimensions such as the number, the success ratio, or the primary political sponsors have changed along with the different levels of power dispersion/concentration applying regression analyses. Moreover, the key analysis includes both orthodox and unorthodox social policies and applies multiple methods (e. g. social network analysis, media content analysis, or theory-informed narratives) to verify/triangulate/fine-tune findings from the legislation patterns. The result suggests that when bargaining among a number of parties/politicians prevailed, welfare policy tended to be premised on the lowest common denominatorâthe median voters such as consumers, women, labourers who often were unorganized and not geographically concentrated. As a result, the <b>dispersed</b> <b>power</b> structure went hand in hand with a loose but broad issue coalitionâfor specific welfare expansionsâamong academia, civil society, bureaucrats, and politicians irrespective of their ideology.

To meet this requirement, distributed power supply systems, such as gas engine, fuel cell, photovoltaic system, and solar heat, are considered to be one of solutions. By producing electricity, these systems generate thermal energy as a byproduct, and by using exhaust heat as thermal energy, we can help to minimize the CO 2 emissions. In this study, we aimed energy-conservation and carbon dioxide emission reduction of supermarket which introduced a novel environment-friendly <b>dispersed</b> <b>power.</b> At first, we divided the energy consumption devices of the supermarket into the groups of illumination, air conditioning, refrigeration, hot water supply by using purpose and measured the time changes of its energy consumption in each seasons. And we verified the outside and the indoor air conditions, and the operation characteristics of individual energy consumption devices. The supermarket we measured is located in Isesaki-city, the northern Kanto region in Japan. From this measurement, we understood that the annual energy consumption of the refrigeration section was about 60 - 70 % of the whole one of supermarket. It means that the energy reduction of the refrigeration section greatly contributes to energy conservation of supermarket. Most of the energy consumption apparatus of the refrigeration section of the supermarket are refrigerated cabinets and its power consumption highly depended on the indoor air enthalpy and the outside air temperature. When we are going to introduce <b>dispersed</b> <b>power</b> into a certain facility, the biggest problem that should be solved is annual utilization rate increase in exhaust heat. Because the annual utilization rate increment of the exhaust heat was not guaranteed by using only to heating, we built the demonstration supermarket which equipped environmental friendly <b>dispersed</b> <b>power</b> (gas engine, solar cell, solar heat), and utilized this supermarket for waste heat helpful use. In this study, we tried to increment the condenser exit supercooling of the refrigerated cabinet which had had the biggest energy consumption in a supermarket and, validated its energy conservation effect and carbon dioxide emission reduction one. The cold temperature that used for supercooling was manufactured by adsorption type refrigerator. The energy conservation effect of supercooling is about from 10 to 25 % during the summertime and intermediate time. However there is no effect of supercooling in the winter because the outside temperature is low. At last we found that when the outside temperature is about 15 ? or more, supercooling effect appears. In addition, since energy consumption of the refrigerated cabinet is influenced by the indoor enthalpy, we adjusted the indoor air temperature and humidity by introducing the desiccant system and validated its effect...|$|R

40|$|Free {{molecular}} heating (FMH) {{is caused}} by the transfer of energy during collisions between the upper atmosphere molecules and a space vehicle. The dispersed free molecular heating on a surface is an important constraint for space vehicle thermal analyses since it can be a significant source of heating. To reduce FMH to a spacecraft, the parking orbit is often designed to a higher altitude at the expense of payload capability. Dispersed FMH is a function of both space vehicle velocity and atmospheric density, however, the space vehicle velocity variations are insignificant when compared to the atmospheric density variations. The density of the upper atmosphere molecules is a function of altitude, but also varies with other environmental factors, such as solar activity, geomagnetic activity, location, and time. A method has been developed to predict three sigma <b>maximum</b> <b>dispersed</b> density for up to 15 years into the future. This method uses a state-of-the-art atmospheric density code, MSIS 86, along with 50 years of solar data, NASA and NOAA solar activity predictions for the next 15 years, and an Aerospace Corporation correlation to account for density code inaccuracies to generate <b>dispersed</b> <b>maximum</b> density ratios denoted as 'K-factors'.
