PURPOSE: To {{examine the effects of}} a flame resistant synthetic material base layer on heat stress factors. METHODS: Ten recreationally active males (25 ± 6. 1 yrs, 80. 9 ± 8. 4 kg, 11. 1 ± 5. 3 % fat, 4. 4 ± 0. 6 L·min- 1 VO 2 max) completed two trials of intermittent (50 min walking, 10 min sitting) treadmill walking (2. 5 mph, 4 % grade) over 3 hours in a climate chamber (35 ⁰C, 30 % RH). Participants wore standard WLFF Nomex green pants, yellow shirt with either a 100 % cotton base layer (C) or a flame resistant synthetic material base layer (S), while carrying a 35 lb pack, hard hat, and gloves. Exercise was followed by a 30 minute rest period without pack, hard hat, gloves, or Nomex yellow shirt. Core (Tc) and skin (Tsk) temperature were measured continuously throughout the trial. Skin blood flow (SBF) and skin temperature (DTsk) was recorded via laser doppler for two minutes prior to walking, five minutes during each break, and three, five minute periods during the 30 minutes following exercise. Physiological strain index (PSI) was calculated. Water was scripted at 8 ml/kg/hr. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed using SPSS 22. 0. RESULTS: Significant <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> time were found on Tc (p≤ 0. 001) and Tsk (p= 0. 003). No significant trialXtime interactions were found in Tc (p= 0. 077) and Tsk (p= 0. 086). SBF showed significant <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> time (p= 0. 001) and a trialXtime interaction (p= 0. 001). Significant <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> time were found on DTsk (p= 0. 001). Comparisons for SBF and DTsk were made between peaks, nadirs, and the three post-exercise periods for C and S. Significant <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> time were found on SBF peaks (p= 0. 001), nadirs (p= 0. 028), and posts (p= 0. 001).

Overall, frequency of initiatic,ns was greater within culture and sex than across culture and sex. The failure to find significant effects of culture or sex on negative initiations suggests that the lack of cross-cultural peer interactions is not motivated by hostile intentions. The lack of cross-cultural interactions is discussed in terms of peer familiarity and communication skills.

This {{study sought to}} examine whether the between-day reliability of central SBP (cSBP) and systemic arterial wave reflection (augmentation index, AIx) readings exceed the criterion for acceptable reliability or are affected by posture (supine and seated) and fasting state. METHODS: Twenty healthy adults (50 % female, 27. 9 years, 24. 2 ?kg/m) were tested on six different mornings: 3 days fasted and 3 days nonfasted. On each occasion, participants were tested in supine and seated postures. Oscillometric pressure waveforms were recorded on left upper arm. RESULTS: For cSBP, there was nonsignificant <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> fasting state (P?=? 0. 819) {{but there was a}} <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> <b>for</b> posture (P?=? 0. 002).

The criterion intraclass correlation coefficient value of 0. 75 was exceeded for both variables when participants were assessed under the combined supine-fasted condition. For cSBP, the reliability coefficient was lowest (best) when supine fasted (6. 8 ?mmHg) and greatest (worst) when seated nonfasted (8. 6 ?mmHg). For AIx, the reliability coefficient was lower for the supine (11. 4 - 11. 7 %) compared with the seated (14. 0 - 15. 2 %) posture.

Subjects. 27 male throwers (mean age[*]=[*] 25. 1 years old, SD[*]=[*] 2. 4) with adequate knowledge of demonstrable throwing mechanics. Study Design. Randomized crossover trial with repeated measures. Methods. Subjects warmed up, threw 10 pitches at their maximum velocity, were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 stretching protocols (static, PNF, or no stretch), and then repeated their 10 pitches.
