Apart from direct age discrimination which can also be objectively justified, the general rule for direct discrimination, elaborated in EA 2010 Schedule 9, is that an employer may only be exempt if it can show that having a worker fit a particular description is a [...] "genuine occupational requirement". This means the (otherwise) discriminatory practice must pursue a legitimate aim {{in terms of the}} nature of the occupation itself (not the employer's business needs generally) and the practice must be proportionate. The test is stringent. In Etam plc v Rowan a man was turned down for a job at a woman's clothing store, with the excuse that a man should not operate women's change rooms. But this did not count as a genuine occupational requirement because the shift allocation could have been easily changed. By contrast, it was held in Wolf v Stadt Frankfurt am Main that a requirement to be under 30 years old when joining the fire service could be a genuine occupational requirement, to ensure fitness. Controversially, the European Court of Justice has repeatedly said that it is within a member state's <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> to say being male is a genuine occupational requirement for work in the military. This was even so, in Sirdar v The Army Board & Secretary of State for Defence, for a lady who applied to work as a chef in the Royal Marines, because the policy on [...] "interoperability" [...] meant every member had to be capable of combat. Cases involving religion are subject to a special provision, so that if a job's functions require adherence to an organisation's ethos, the organisation has an exemption from direct discrimination. In an action for judicial review of the legislation, Richards J rejected that a faith school would be exempt in any way, rather than an actual religious establishment like a church. Even there, it was rejected that a gay person could be dismissed from a job as a cleaner or bookshop worker, if that was incompatible with the religious [...] "ethos", because the ethos would not be a genuine requirement to carry out the job.|$|E

Weiler, European University Institute; Professor Gráinne de Búrca, New York University; Professor Aida Torres Pérez, Universitat Pompeu Fabra. The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} {{the way in which}} the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) uses the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> discretion-technique to adjudicate cases involving fundamental rights, and importantly, what this use entails. This thesis will answer these questions by presenting the argument that the <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> discretion-technique opens up discretional spaces in specific instances of adjudication that enable participation of actors from both legal loci, along with their respective readings of legal sources. This creates an adjudicative process that blurs the boundaries between what is a EUropean and what is a nationally defined standard of fundamental rights protection. The <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> discretion-technique therefore promotes euro-national interconnectedness in the formulation of the applicable standard of fundamental rights protection in a given case, rather than separating subject matters and legal conflicts along jurisdictional lines. The presentation of this thesis proceeds as follows. Firstly, the origins of techniques of coordination of overlapping jurisdictions that share commitment to norms, such as <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion,</b> will be investigated and thereafter understood in the context of the European Union. Secondly, three dominant narratives pertaining to discourse on the CJEU's adjudication of fundamental rights will be reconstructed and their reliance on euro-national binary logics will be highlighted. These narratives then serve as points of contrast in what is the main body of the thesis, namely a presentation of three typologies <b>of</b> the CJEU's <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> discretion-use in its case law involving fundamental rights. In contrast to the dominant narratives, these typologies will illustrate the intricate sharing of interpretative authority that the <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> represent, which creates the precondition for an interconnected elaboration of the standard of fundamental rights protection. Lastly, the legal pattern of interconnectedness will be picked apart and understood as a feature of the CJEU's adjudication of fundamental rights...|$|R

Although, in effect, planning, steering and coordination instruments, and finally those of financing and evaluation, assigned to peripheries during the course of the various policy-making phases, may manage to depict territorial boards as authentic centres of political decision, it will always be the central government that will decide upon the degree and contents of decentralisation.

It applies a qualitative single country-study, focusing on the transposition of six directives in the Netherlands, from the policy areas of consumer protection, environment and justice and home affairs (migration). In the theoretical part the concept <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> is explored, using insights from both the legal and political sciences. The empirical analysis then presents both EU and national processes regarding the six directives, addressed individually {{as well as in}} a comparative manner. This study contributes to clarifying the reasons and circumstances regarding the granting <b>of</b> different <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> to Member States and the effects <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> on EU negotiations and national transposition. It confirms that discretion can have facilitating and impeding effects on transposition, explains why, and identifies other factors affecting transposition by interacting with discretion. Additionally, a more fine-grained approach to measuring discretion is proposed than hitherto. Finally, but addressed separately from the empirical analysis, the link between discretion and legitimacy is elaborated. It is argued that discretion in national transposition processes can be used to enhance the directives’ input, throughput and output legitimacy within national law...|$|R

This reflected the recurrent attempt, typical of this area, to build self-sufficient systems of law, resting on autonomous principles.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{explores the}} relationship between the autonomy and the accountability of international organisations. It argues that the degree of autonomy of an international organisation {{is a function of the}} model of managerial accountability applied by this organisation. An appropriate model of managerial accountability, though it may seem to constrain an international organisation’s autonomy, may in fact be a way of enhancing it. If accountability and autonomy are not conceived of as mutually reinforcing then the effectiveness, the legitimacy and, ultimately, the overall authority of the organisation might be severely compromised. Properly functioning managerial accountability systems allow an international organisation to enjoy its autonomy to the fullest extent while limiting the ability of its staff to overstep their <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion.</b> These findings are supported by a study of the managerial accountability practices in major international organisations, notably the UN and the EU, and the recent reforms that these organisations carried in response to scandals such as the resignation of the Santer Commission or the Oil-for-Food scandal. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|Concerning {{with the}} changes of the {{institutional}} design of the European Union, the current model governance has been shaped as a setup of constraints upon political <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion,</b> applying the central tenet of ordoliberalism with the aim to use strong rules {{in order to reduce}} the discretionary exercise of powers by institutions so as to avoid an arbitrary use of them. This principle has achieved an extreme effect at the European level, that one not to avoid arbitrary use of political powers but to keep political responsibility and participation out of the decision-making process. As Laruffa concludes: [...] "It is quite clear that such a model of governance, which is made only by rules without any role for a democratic policy-making process, imposes a de facto limit to on the political rights of the European citizens. This means that there is a control exercised by rules over the European citizens rather than a control by the European citizens over rules and policies." ...|$|E

The applicants argued that civil marriage was a union of two persons encompassing all aspects of lives, and the procreation of children {{was no longer a}} decisive element to the union of marriage. [...] They considered the reference to ‘national laws’ in Article 12 of the Convention could not mean that states were given unlimited discretion in regulating that right. Government maintained that both the clear wording of Article 12 and the Court’s case-law as it stood indicated that the right to marry was by its very nature limited to different sex couples. Austrian Government conceded that there has been significant social changes in the institution of marriage since the adoption of the Convention, but there was not yet any European consensus on granting same sex couples the right to marry.Having regard to Article 9 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the Court no longer considered that the right to marry enshrined in Article 12 of the ECHR must in all circumstances be limited to marriage between two persons of the opposite sex. [...] Nevertheless, as matters stand, the question whether or not to allow same sex marriage is to be left to regulation by the national law of the Contracting State, [...] and no violation of Article 12 was found. The Court reasoned that the choice of the wording of Article 12 must be considered deliberate. The right was granted in the context of strictly traditional concepts of marriage and a lack of European consensus upheld the wide <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> afforded to Contracting states.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{critical}} {{assessment of the}} financial reforms adopted or proposed at the European level. The reshaping of the EU institutional architecture and {{the adoption of the}} new Basel 3 rules should reduce the national <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> that have up to now characterised supervisory practices, often leading to light touch supervision, and restrain the growth of bankarisation, hence excessive systemic leveraging. However, the limitations of a purely prudential approach to regulation may not be overcome by setting up new institutions and make prudential requirements more stringent. In addition, given unavoidable national banking specificities, more severe rulebooks homogenously applied across the EU countries could further worsen the inconsistencies of a one-size-fits-all rule. The criticisms directed at the new regulatory framework assume particular relevance in the EU, whose peculiar construction requires that the financial sector should not be permitted to jeopardise its critical fiscal equilibrium. This opens the way to the adoption of structural measures, as the one presented by the Vickers Commission on ring-fencing. Looking at the financial system as a whole, we argue that even these measures do not offer effective protection for the economy and tax-payers, and that much more radical interventions are needed. financial reforms, European Union, Basel 3, Vickers Commission, ring-fencing...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> {{appreciation}} (or <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> state <b>discretion)</b> is {{a doctrine}} {{with a wide}} scope in international human rights law. It {{was developed by the}} European Court of Human Rights, to judge whether a state party to the European Convention on Human Rights should be sanctioned for derogations. The doctrine allows the Court to reconcile practical differences in implementing the articles of the Convention. Such differences create a limited right, for Contracting Parties, [...] "to derogate from the obligations laid down in the Convention". The doctrine also reinforces the role of the European Convention, as a supervisory framework for human rights. In applying this discretion, European Court judges must take into account differences between domestic laws of the Contracting States as they relate to substance and procedure.

This paper argues that the AB’s statements are both internally coherent and coherent in light of the whole of its jurisprudence by way of two arguments. First, a panel indeed has no <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> to decline to exercise validly established jurisdiction. However, jurisdiction is not automatically validly established. Second, legal impediments precluding validly established jurisdiction exist. These are, it is argued, Articles 3. 7 and 3. 10 DSU. The paper subsequently develops ‘procedural’ good faith in Article 3. 10 DSU as a legal impediment and explains that the test for a violation of this provision demands a ‘clear statement’. While the conditions for the fruitful invocation of a violation of ‘procedural’ good faith as in Article 3. 10 DSU have never been met in WTO disputes, we nonetheless consider that case law has cleared the path for a dispute in which this would be possible. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an enquiry into the {{regulation}} of immigration through criminal law and its institutions. It looks at the range of immigration offences in British legislation, and whether {{and how they are}} being used in practice. The criminalisation of immigration status has historically served functions of exclusion and control against those who defy the state’s powers over its territory and population. In the last two decades, the prerogatives to exclude and punish have been enhanced by the expansion of the catalogue of immigration offences and the more systematic enforcement of these powers. The great reliance on the criminal law to regulate immigration is distinctive of a period in which crime and immigration have been increasingly politicised. As a consequence, more offences have been created and more individuals have been subject to the hybrid immigration and criminal justice system. While immigration offences largely remain under-enforced, some of them –particularly those penalising document fraud and identity stripping- are used against foreign nationals who cannot be removed from the country. In this thesis I explain what I consider to be the most pernicious consequences of this expansion of formal and substantive criminalisation of immigration breaches. The existence of a parallel system of sanctions allows enforcement agencies wide <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion.</b> Therefore, similar cases may be dealt with in very different ways. When the criminal route is chosen, the use of criminal law {{in the vast majority of}} cases reaching the criminal courts is unnecessary, disproportionate and extremely harmful. Both the decision to prosecute and the sanction eventually imposed are justified by preventive and regulatory purposes. The actual practice of criminalisation reveals that the criminal procedural safeguards are weakened and those accused of immigration crimes are likely to be convicted and imprisoned for these offences. I conclude that the formal and substantive criminalisation of immigration represents a departure from liberal criminal law principles and the purposes of criminal punishment. These conclusions cast doubts about the pragmatic, non-principled use of criminal law to regulate immigration flows, and call for the need to look at other, more humane alternatives in the treatment of ‘unwelcome’ migrants.

On the basis of this definition, the article concludes that tribunals have taken conflicting approaches concerning the margin, ranging from its explicit adoption to its explicit rejection. On the normative question, the article concludes that states are entitled to a measure <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> under common investment treaty standards, while the notion of deference does not concord with the importance of independent arbitral review for the effective protection of foreign investments.

40|$|The last {{sixty years}} {{witnessed}} an unprecedented expansion of international trade. The system {{created by the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and later by the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{has proved to be}} an efficient instrument for the elimination of trade and tariff barriers. This process coincided with increased national regulatory controls, which were particularly visible in the area of risk regulation. Governments, responding to the demands of their domestic constituencies, have adopted a wide range of regulatory measures aimed at protecting the environment and human health. Although, for the most part, the new regulatory initiatives served legitimate objectives, it has also turned out that internal measures might become an attractive vehicle for protectionism, taking the place that was traditionally occupied by tariff barriers. The WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) is an attempt by the international community to limit possible abuses while assuring WTO Members <b>of</b> an extensive <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> regulatory <b>discretion.</b> The central problem that the book tackles is whether the system established by the SPS Agreement can address the existing and potential challenges of a new interdependent world. In answering this question, the author provides a comprehensive and critical examination of the substantive provisions of the Agreement and corresponding case law. In this context, the book particularly focuses on two issues: the consistency in the interpretation of the SPS Agreement and the appropriateness of its various requirements. This analysis leads the author to conclude that despite some interpretative failures of SPS case law, the system established by the SPS Agreement seems to provide an effective solution for the supervision of domestic SPS measures.

The importance of the use that contracting authorities make of their <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> {{is directly related to the}} result of any public procurement procedure: the level of satisfaction of the contracting authorities’ needs provided by the works/supply/service contract concluded with the winning tenderer.
