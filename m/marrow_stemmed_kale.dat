40|$|Abstract: Many plants {{grown at}} {{elevated}} CO 2 concentrations exhibit enhanced photosynthetic rates. However, {{this increase in}} photosynthesis is often reduced after prolonged exposure to elevated CO 2. This reduction {{may be related to}} the capacity of plants to utilize the extra photosynthate produced at elevated CO 2. This study examined the effect of source to sink ratio on the capacity of plants to respond to elevated CO 2. Seven species or cultivars within the genus Brassica were germinated and grown at either 350 or 1000 ppm CO 2. Broccoli (Brassica oleracea L.) and cauliflower (B. oleracea L.) have large carbon sinks in the reproductive structures; Chinese broccoli (Brassica campestris L.) and <b>marrow</b> <b>stem</b> <b>kale</b> (B. oleracea) have carbon sinks in the stem; turnip (B. campestris) stores carbon in the root; rape (Brassica napus L.) and white mustard (Brassica alba (L.) Rabenh.) have no obvious carbon storage structures and were assumed to have a lower sink strength relative to the above cultivars. Plants were harvested at three stages of development and total plant weight, leaf area ratio, and allocation to leaf, root, and stem determined. As young seedlings, all cultivars responded positively to elevated CO 2. The long-term growth response of different cultivars to CO 2 was independent of sink location, but was dependent on sink size. Cultivars with no obvious carbon storage structures showed no significant growth enhancement by elevated CO 2 by the end of the experiment. However, neither leaf area ratio nor biomass allocation pattern were reliable predictors of response to CO 2 suggesting that assessing differences in source to sink ratio is not necessarily straightforward. Key words: biomass allocation, sink strength, functional groups, elevated carbon dioxide, leaf area ratio...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveExperimental and {{clinical}} {{studies have suggested}} that intramyocardial bone <b>marrow</b> <b>stem</b> cell transplantation combined with coronary artery bypass grafting might improve left ventricular function in the setting of chronic ischemic heart disease. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of available publications regarding the efficacy and safety of intramyocardial bone <b>marrow</b> <b>stem</b> cell transplantation during coronary artery bypass grafting. MethodsThe databases PUBMED, MEDLINE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and ClinicalTrials. gov (all from their inception to May 2009) were searched for randomized controlled trials and cohort studies of intramyocardial bone <b>marrow</b> <b>stem</b> cell transplantation during coronary artery bypass grafting to treat ischemic heart disease. Six studies were included. ResultsCompared with control groups, the bone <b>marrow</b> <b>stem</b> cell transplantation group showed a significant improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline to follow-up (5. 40 %; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 36 – 9. 44; P = . 009). Moreover, the overall change of left ventricular end-diastolic volume from baseline to follow-up favored the bone <b>marrow</b> <b>stem</b> cell therapy group (9. 55 mL; 95 % confidence interval, − 2. 82 to 21. 92; P = . 13). Major adverse cardiovascular events, including ventricular arrhythmia and the composite of other cardiovascular events, were not significantly different between the bone <b>marrow</b> <b>stem</b> cell therapy group and controls (relative risk for ventricular arrhythmia =  0. 951; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 389 – 2. 325; P = . 913; relative risk for cardiovascular event =  1. 134; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 28 – 4. 6; P = . 86). ConclusionsClinical evidence suggests that intramyocardial bone <b>marrow</b> <b>stem</b> cell transplantation in combination with coronary artery bypass grafting is associated with improvements of functional parameters in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease. Furthermore, surgical intramyocardial bone <b>marrow</b> <b>stem</b> cell transplantation seems to be safe...|$|R

Here, we first isolated and cultured bone <b>marrow</b> mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells from female and male rats by density gradient centrifugation.

Using the transwell system, retinal ganglion cells were co-cultured with bone <b>marrow</b> mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells under hypoxia. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and caspase- 3 activity assay. We found a marked increase in apoptotic rate and caspase- 3 activity of retinal ganglion cells after 24 hours of hypoxia compared with normoxia. Moreover, apoptotic rate and caspase- 3 activity of retinal ganglion cells significantly decreased with both female and male bone <b>marrow</b> mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cell co-culture under hypoxia compared with culture alone, with more significant effects from female bone <b>marrow</b> mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells.

The rabbit models were repaired with autologous nerve, a {{polylactic glycolic acid}} conduit + bone <b>marrow</b> mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells, or a polylactic glycolic acid conduit + bone <b>marrow</b> mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells + extracellular matrix gel. After 24 weeks, mechanical testing was performed to determine the stress relaxation and creep parameters. Following sciatic nerve injury, the magnitudes of the stress decrease and strain increase at 7, 200 seconds were largest in the polylactic glycolic acid conduit + bone <b>marrow</b> mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells + extracellular matrix gel group, followed by the polylactic glycolic acid conduit + bone <b>marrow</b> mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells group, and then the autologous nerve group. Hematoxylin-eosin staining demonstrated that compared with the polylactic glycolic acid conduit + bone <b>marrow</b> mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells group and the autologous nerve group, a more complete sciatic nerve regeneration was found, including good myelination, regularly arranged nerve fibers, and a completely degraded and resorbed conduit, in the polylactic glycolic acid conduit + bone <b>marrow</b> mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells + extracellular matrix gel group. These results indicate that bridging 10 -mm sciatic nerve defects with a polylactic glycolic acid conduit + bone <b>marrow</b> mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells + extracellular matrix gel construct increases the stress relaxation under a constant strain, reducing anastomotic tension. Large elongations under a constant physiological load can limit the anastomotic opening and shift, which is beneficial for the regeneration and functional reconstruction of sciatic nerve.

Herein, we {{put forward a}} hypothetic model for cancer stem cells initiation from bone <b>marrow</b> <b>stem</b> cells. Methods: Scientific published Data concerning cancers' origin and evolution has been collected and analyzed. To do so, we used key words related to cancer and bone <b>marrow</b> <b>stem</b> cells, and their evolving. Results: our results showed that bone <b>marrow</b> <b>stem</b> cells could differentiate into an ancestral progenitor that activates a memorial program – the black box cassette- that is responsible of abnormal neo-organogenesis {{in the form of}} tumors and metastases. This fastidious program is supposed to be epigenetically controlled. Such differentiation could be either spontaneous or induced by carcinogens. Conclusion: It is assumed that bone marrow progenitors enter a cascade of an abnormal genemically programmed differentiations/ de-differentitions to transform into a cancer stem cell. To approve this theory it is suggested that characterizing and investigating the most primitive forms of the bone marrow progenitors is required; both inside their niche and in circulation of cancer patients...|$|R

To explain this mechanism, an experimental study has quantified that the bone marrow cell transplantation decreases the number of inflammatory cells and reduces the fibrosis area in chagasic mice. Using this experimental data, we have developed an agent-based computational model to investigate the regeneration of the chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy after bone <b>marrow</b> <b>stem</b> cell transplantation. Results: Our model includes six different types of agents: inflammatory cell, fibrosis area, cardiomyocyte, proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α, Trypanosoma cruzi parasite and bone <b>marrow</b> <b>stem</b> cell.
