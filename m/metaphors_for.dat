5|$|The {{most popular}} {{subjects}} {{of this type}} include the Flight into Egypt and the plight of hermits such as Saints Jerome and Anthony. As well as connecting the style to the later Age of Discovery, the role of Antwerp as a booming centre both of world trade and cartography, and the wealthy town-dweller's view of the countryside, art historians have explored the paintings as religious <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> the pilgrimage of life.|$|E
5|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} {{immaterial}} {{concepts such as}} the soul and afterlife. At times, however, {{the very concept of}} the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given that it has no inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E
5|$|The lantern as {{a source}} of {{illumination}} in art was widely used by Baroque artists, and perfected by Caravaggio. Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> the presence of God. Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations; but in The Third of May the lantern manifests no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence. The traditional role of light in art as a conduit for the spiritual has been subverted.|$|E

5|$|According to Shinkai, {{shoes were}} a <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> life as Yukari learned to walk again, while Takao's shoe-making typified their relationship.

25|$|Among American adolescents, {{baseball}} <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> sex {{are often}} used as euphemisms for the degree of physical intimacy achieved in sexual encounters or relationships.

50|$|Some metaphors are disease-specific. Slavery is {{a common}} <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> addictions: The {{alcoholic}} is enslaved by drink, and the smoker is captive to nicotine.

5000|$|In the Buffy series, {{magic is}} often used as a <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> other things. For example, during season four magic {{is used as a}} <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> the lesbian {{relationship}} between Willow and Tara that is only hinted at (if rather overtly) until the episode [...] "New Moon Rising" [...] when the relationship is revealed. Also, briefly in season five and heavily in season six, when Willow becomes addicted to magic, magic is used as a <b>metaphor</b> <b>for</b> drug addiction, with Willow going through all the typical destructive behaviors and withdrawal symptoms of a drug addict.|$|R
25|$|Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) {{borrowed}} {{terms and}} interpretations {{from the late}} 19th and early-20th century classical scholarship in German and French {{as a source of}} <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> his reframing of psychoanalytic treatment into a spiritualistic ritual of initiation and rebirth. The Eleusinian mysteries, particularly the qualities of the Kore, figured prominently in his writings.|$|E

25|$|Divine {{judgment}} by God {{was passed}} upon Sodom and Gomorrah and two neighboring cities, which were completely consumed by fire and brimstone. Neighboring Zoar (Bela) {{was the only}} city to be spared. In Abrahamic religions, Sodom and Gomorrah have become synonymous with impenitent sin, and their fall with a proverbial manifestation of divine retribution. Sodom and Gomorrah have been used historically and today as <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> vice and homosexuality, although a close reading {{of the text and}} other Ancient Near Eastern sources suggest that this association may be incorrect.|$|E

25|$|Faulkner's {{numerous}} {{contributions to}} the field of NLP began in 1984 with his modeling of Accelerated Learning, to pioneer more efficient and effective learning strategies. He taught this model together with NLP, to a group of teachers in Japan that same year. The result of this work was the founding of Learning How to Learn. Upon returning to the U.S. in 1985, he modeled the Metaphors of Identity. This model states that an individual's strategies and behavior patterns are informed by deeply structured <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> life, self, desired outcomes and challenges. By adopting new metaphors, an individual can create new pathways to transformation.|$|E
25|$|The {{writers of}} the series often use {{elements}} of fantasy and horror as <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> real-life conflicts. The series' use of magic, as noted by religion professor Gregory Stevenson, neither promotes nor denigrates Wiccan ideals and Willow rejects Wiccan colleagues for not practicing the magic she favors. Throughout the series, magic is employed to represent different ideas -— relationships, sexuality, ostracism, power, and particularly for Willow, addiction -— that change between episodes and seasons. The ethical judgment of magic, therefore, lies in the results: performing magic to meet selfish needs or neglecting to appreciate its power often ends disastrously. Using it wisely for altruistic reasons is considered a positive act on the series.|$|E

25|$|Theology in the Flesh {{shows that}} biblical writers used {{a wide array}} of metaphors to {{understand}} topics such as sin, salvation, and God. Salvation, for example, is thought of in terms of release from slavery, as friendship with God, as healing, as returning from the dead, and as finding your way home to list but a few. No single metaphor says everything that we can say about salvation and so multiple metaphors are needed. There are often several legitimate ways, within constraints, for Christians to understand a topic. The book provides lots of examples of how different Christian communities, over time and across cultures, use different <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> salvation and so arrive at conflicting theological positions.|$|E
25|$|Jidaimono, {{or history}} plays, were set {{within the context}} of major events in Japanese history. Strict {{censorship}} laws during the Edo period prohibited the representation of contemporary events and particularly prohibited criticising the shogunate or casting it in a bad light, although enforcement varied greatly over the years. Many shows were set {{in the context of the}} Genpei War of the 1180s, the Nanboku-chō Wars of the 1330s, or other historical events. Frustrating the censors, many shows used these historical settings as <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> contemporary events. Kanadehon Chūshingura, one of the most famous plays in the kabuki repertoire, serves as an excellent example; it is ostensibly set in the 1330s, though it actually depicts the contemporary (18th century) affair of the revenge of the 47 Ronin.|$|E
25|$|Early alchemists, such as Zosimos of Panopolis (c. AD 300), {{highlight}} the spiritual {{nature of the}} alchemical quest, symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul. This approach continued in the Middle Ages, as metaphysical aspects, substances, physical states, and material processes were used as <b>metaphors</b> <b>for</b> spiritual entities, spiritual states, and, ultimately, transformation. In this sense, the literal meanings of 'Alchemical Formulas' were a blind, hiding their true spiritual philosophy. Practitioners and patrons such as Melchior Cibinensis and Pope Innocent VIII existed within {{the ranks of the}} church, while Martin Luther applauded alchemy for its consistency with Christian teachings. Both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible, and ephemeral state toward a perfect, healthy, incorruptible, and everlasting state, so the philosopher's stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic alchemical symbols, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning.|$|E
