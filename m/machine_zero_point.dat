So φ '(s_ 2) < 0, φ '(s_ 3) < 0. Without loss of generality, suppose s_ 2 < s_ 3. Thus there is a point s̅_ 2 in a certain right {{neighborhood}} of s_ 2 and a point s̅_ 3 in a certain left neighborhood of s_ 3 such that s̅_ 2 < s̅_ 3, φ (s̅_ 2) < 0 and φ (s̅_ 3) > 0. So there exists a <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> of φ (s) between s̅_ 2 and s̅_ 3, thereby between s_ 2 and s_ 3. This result shows that there is at least one <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> of φ (s) between any two <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of it. So, the <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> of φ (s) between s_ 2 and s_ 3 is dense. Then φ '(s_ 2) (or φ '(s_ 3)) is 0 or does not exist, this is contrary to the fact that φ '(s_ 2) < 0 (or φ '(s_ 3) < 0).

30|$|The {{theory of}} {{monotone}} operators has {{appeared as a}} powerful and effective tool for studying a wide class of problems arising in different branches of social, engineering, and pure sciences in a unified and general framework. There is a notion about monotone operators {{and it is one}} of generalized sums of two monotone operators; see [15, 16] and the references therein. In recent years, monotone operators have received a lot of attention for treating <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of monotone operators and fixed point of mappings which are Lipschitz continuous; see [17 – 22] and the references therein. The first algorithm for approximating the <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of the maximal monotone operator was introduced by Martinet [23]. He considered the proximal point algorithm for finding <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of a maximal monotone operator. Then, Passty [24] introduced a forward-backward algorithm method for finding <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of the sum of two operators. There are various applications of the problem of finding <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of the sum of two operators; see [25 – 29] for example and the references therein.|$|R

It is assumed that the set is integrally convex, which implies that the convex hull of the set can be subdivided in simplices such that every vertex {{is an element of}} and each simplex of the triangulation lies in an n-dimensional cube of size one. With respect to this triangulation we assume that the function satisfies some property that replaces continuity. Under this property and some boundary condition the function has a <b>zero</b> <b>point.</b> To prove this we use a simplicial algorithm that terminates with a <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> within a finite number of iterations. The standard technique of applying a fixed point theorem to a piecewise linear approximation cannot be applied, because the 'continuity property' is too weak to assure that a <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> of the piecewise linear approximation induces a <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> of the function itself.
