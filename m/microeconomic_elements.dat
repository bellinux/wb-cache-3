30|$|Experiments in CGE {{modeling}} framework involve shocking the exogenous variables, {{after which}} the model equations are re-solved to yield new solution values for all the endogenous variables. The new values represent new equilibrium in which supply in all markets across the economy once gain equals demand at some new set of prices. The results obtained from the simulations are comparative static results. Thus, the models study {{the impact of the}} changes in exogenous parameters (shocks) on allocation of goods among consumers and resources among productive activities and also the consequences for economic efficiency. Alternative equilibrium states are compared without considering the path between the two states. Thus, the models do not have explicit time dimension. They represent different time frames by changing the <b>microeconomic</b> <b>elements</b> of the closure. The results of static simulations are often interpreted as representing how an economic system would look if the new policy had been in place in the base year, after relevant adjustments had taken place (Gilbert 2001).|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} the legacy for modern macroeconomics of Kalecki’s theory of income determination. The latter is reconstructed in its analytical constituent parts referring in detail {{to the original}} sources. The critical appraisal of its historical relevance is made {{from the vantage point}} of the specific strain of contemporary New-Keynesian macroeconomics that is also based, after a long historical gap, on imperfectly competitive <b>microeconomic</b> foundations. Important <b>elements</b> of Kalecki’s theoretical construction have been a lasting, even if usually unacknowledged, legacy to the toolkit of modern macroeconomics. kalecki, macroeconomics, imperfect competition, income determination, microeconomic foundations...|$|R
40|$|The {{necessity}} {{to identify and}} implement a solution for the region subject to the process globalization appeared due to the following reasons: during the stage of evolution {{of the process of}} globalization, there is no kind of coordination of this process towards the accomplishment of its goals, the character of this process being determined by the multitude of <b>microeconomic</b> processual <b>elements</b> coordinated from particular levels; therefore, the only objectives to be achieved are microeconomic by their nature, and there is a risk that adverse effects appear at the macroeconomic levels in relation with the specific objectives of the microeconomic level; the possible configuration of a global system of process administration is outrun temporally by the evolution of the global real economy. This entire period, represented by the stage of evolution of the process of globalization, is characterized by the lack of risk management capacity, the only such capacities, possibly to be activated, being those at the local level, but they have a low efficacy compared to the global nature of the risk and effects...|$|R

The analysis {{is based on}} a sample of small firms created in the period 1990 - 2000 in three intermediate cities in Buenos Aires province (Argentina) in manufacturing sector. The survey collected data about <b>microeconomic</b> and mesoeconomic <b>elements</b> influencing firm performance. Results indicate that tradability is a key factor influencing firm performance. New firms entering markets where the spatial markets are reduced face limited perspectives on expansion. In turn, tradability is also affected by entrepeneurial motivation and, especially in underveloped regions, macroeconomic variables. new firms, post-entry performance, transability...|$|R

Increased integration and sophistication of financial markets brought new forms and more global character of the crises episodes. Eichengreen, Rose and Wyplosz (1994) propose the operational definition, which helps to select the episodes most closely fitting the intuitive understanding of a currency crisis (a sudden decline in confidence towards a specific currency). Among fundamental causes of currency crises one can point to the excessive expansion and over-borrowing of the public and private sectors, and inconsistent and nontransparent economic policies. Over-expansion and overborrowing manifest themselves in an excessive current account deficit, currency overvaluation, increasing debt burden, insufficient international reserves, and deterioration of other frequently analyzed indicators. Inconsistent policies (including the so-called intermediate exchange rate regimes) increase market uncertainty and can trigger speculative attack against the domestic currency. After a crisis has already happened, the ability to manage economic policies in a consistent and credible way becomes crucial for limiting the crisis' scope, duration and negative consequences. Among the dilemmas that the authorities face in such circumstances is the decision on readjustment of an exchange rate regime, as the previous regime is usually the first institutional victim of any successful speculative attack. The consequences of currency crises are usually severe and typically involve output and employment losses, fall in real incomes of a population, deep contraction in investment and capital flight. Also the credibility of domestic economic policies is ruined. In some cases a crisis can serve as the economic and political catharsis: devaluation helps to temporarily restore competitiveness and improve a current account position, the crisis shock brings the new, reform-oriented government, and politicians may draw some lessons for future. The responsible macroeconomic policy can help to diminish a risk of an occurrence of a currency crisis. It involves balanced and transparent fiscal accounts, proper monetary-fiscal policy mix, and low inflation, avoiding indexation of nominal variables and intermediate monetary/ exchange rate regimes. On the <b>microeconomic</b> level key <b>elements</b> include privatization, demonopolization and introduction of efficient competition policy, prudential regulation of the financial sector, trade openness, and simple, fair and transparent tax system. All the above should help elimination of soft budget constraints, overborrowing on the side of both private and public sector and moral hazard problems. All these measures need to be strengthened by legal reforms, efficient and fair judiciary system, implementation of international accounting, reporting and disclosure standards, transparent corporate and public governance rules, and many other elements. Reforms can be supported by the IMF and other international organizations, which on their part should depoliticize their actions and decision-making processes, sticking to the professional criteria of country assessment and their consequent execution. currency crisis, financial crisis, contagion, emerging markets, transition economies, exchange rates, monetary policy, fiscal policy, balance of payments, debt, devaluation...|$|R
