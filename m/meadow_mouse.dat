25|$|The meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), {{sometimes}} called the field mouse or <b>meadow</b> <b>mouse,</b> is a North American vole found across Canada, Alaska and the northern United States. Its range extends farther south along the Atlantic coast. One subspecies, the Florida salt marsh vole (M. p. dukecampbelli), is found in Florida, and is classified as endangered. Previously it was also found in Chihuahua, Mexico, but has not been recorded since 1998.|$|E
500|$|Smaller mammals {{native to}} the area include long-tailed weasels, woodchucks, cottontail rabbits, pygmy rabbits, golden-mantled ground squirrels, {{antelope}} squirrels, Townsend's ground squirrels, yellow-pine chipmunks, Ord's kangaroo rats, and northern pocket gophers. [...] Mice species include Great Basin pocket mouse, northern grasshopper mouse, western harvest mouse, deer mouse, <b>meadow</b> <b>mouse,</b> and creeping vole. [...] There are also numerous bat species that live in Oregon's high desert country.|$|E
500|$|The gray-tailed vole (Microtus canicaudus) {{also known}} as the gray-tailed meadow vole or gray-tailed <b>meadow</b> <b>mouse,</b> is a rodent in the genus Microtus (small-eared [...] "meadow voles") of the family Cricetidae. Voles are small mammals, and this species lies roughly {{in the middle of their}} size range. First {{collected}} in 1895, it is endemic to the Willamette Valley, Oregon, and Clark County, Washington, in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Historically, they were found in the prairie areas of the Valley and, though many of these areas have been converted for agricultural purposes, these animals remain common. For reasons that remain unclear, vole population densities in any area may fluctuate widely from season to season and year to year. They are preyed upon by owls, hawks, and carnivorous mammals, and their parasites include fleas and ticks. These voles build underground burrows and complex tunnel networks, which they sometimes share with other burrowing animals. Relatively little is known about their behavior in the wild, because they are elusive and unlikely to enter traps.|$|E

50|$|A vole {{is a small}} rodent; a {{relative}} of the mouse, the vole has a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, smaller ears and eyes, and differently formed molars (high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps). There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as <b>meadow</b> <b>mice</b> or field mice in North America and Australia. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats.|$|R
50|$|The <b>meadow</b> jumping <b>mouse</b> (Zapus hudsonius) is {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} mouse in the subfamily Zapodinae.

50|$|The <b>meadow</b> jumping <b>mouse</b> is {{a decent}} swimmer, it usually will jump in when {{retreating}} from danger, {{or it was}} noticed as well to jump in when being set free. Its method of aquatic locomotion {{is very similar to}} its locomotion on land. At first it pushes off with long thrusts using only its hind feet simultaneously, mimicking its long jumps on land. Afterwards, the jumping is followed by movement of all four limbs, in an almost doggy-paddle-like form, with its head held high above the water. The <b>meadow</b> jumping <b>mouse</b> is also capable of diving, and a maximum distance of four feet was recorded.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the many}} species {{living in the}} park are coyote, cottontail rabbit, red fox, black bear, prairie rattlesnake, {{mountain}} lion, <b>meadow</b> jumping <b>mouse,</b> turkey vulture, golden eagle, prairie falcon, virile crayfish, Woodhouse's toad and the northern leopard frog.|$|R

And when you make yourself uncomfortable, you are almost sure to make everyone around you equally uncomfortable.

2500|$|Big Summit Prairie {{is a large}} high-country meadow {{covering}} [...] in {{the middle}} of the Ochoco Mountains. The prairie is covered by water-loving grasses, overgrown by willows and shrubs in some areas. [...] Tufted hairgrass, elephant's head, and horsetail are common ground cover in the meadowlands. [...] Quaking aspen with shrubby undergrowth attract wildlife not found in other parts of the Ochoco Mountains. [...] Common birds include sandhill crane, Wilson's snipe, long-billed curlew, and northern harrier. [...] Even the rare dickcissel has been sighted at Big Summit Prairie. [...] Larger animals include mule deer, pronghorn, Belding's ground squirrel, northern pocket gopher, <b>meadow</b> <b>mice,</b> and coyotes. [...] Also, Rocky Mountain elk move into the area in the fall.|$|R
50|$|The food {{preference}} of the <b>meadow</b> jumping <b>mouse</b> consists of seeds, {{but they also}} eat berries, fruit and insects. Usually right after emerging from hibernation they will eat the larvae of insects such as butterflies, and beetles of the family Carabidae, and Curculionidae. Later they will feed on seeds, and endogone which is a fungus. Towards the beginning of fall they start to gain weight {{in order to get}} ready for hibernation. Usually two weeks before hibernation is when they began to store up enough fat, and the greatest weight gain is noticed. Overall the <b>meadow</b> jumping <b>mouse</b> {{is considered to be a}} granivore, but can also be classified as an herbivore.|$|R
50|$|Small mammals can be {{significant}} pests to reforestation site and Christmas tree plantations. Voles, or <b>meadow</b> <b>mice,</b> can cause damage to conifer plantation seedlings. The potential for vole infestation is highest when the land has ample grass and undergrowth coverage; {{which is often}} found in plantations and sites that are on old pastures that already have a large vole population. In the U.S. Pacific Northwest, gopher (pocket gopher) damage to conifer seedlings occurs over thousands of acres, causing significant economic loss for the region. Gophers {{have a tendency to}} damage root systems as well as strip bark off the base of seedlings. Other mammal pests to Christmas tree farms include, porcupine, rabbit, deer, and thirteen-lined ground squirrel.|$|R
