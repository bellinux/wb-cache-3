40|$|Lentiviruses are a {{subgroup}} of retroviruses {{that are so}} named because they cause diseases with long incubation periods, insidious onsets, and slowly progressive courses (1). The members of the virus group include visna virus of sheep, caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) I of goats, equine infectious anemia virus of horses, and, tentatively, the retrovirus associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans (2, 3). These agents are host specific and cause persistent infections in various cells {{of the immune system}} (4 - 6). In cultured cells they cause productive lytic infections but in vivo they replicate continuously at a restricted, minimally productive level (7 - 9). The mechanism of this unique type of replication is poorly understood but it sets the pace for the slow onset of chronic disease. The ruminant lentiviruses, <b>visna</b> <b>and</b> <b>CAEV,</b> are prototypes of the lentivirus group and cause chronic-active inflammation characterized by infiltration and proliferation of mononuclear cells in various organ systems.

40|$|The main {{distinguishing}} {{characteristics of}} the subacute spongiform encephalo-pathies are outlined; {{it is suggested that}} the group of diseases covered by the term "subacute spongiform encephalopathies " should be considered as distinct in their properties from other slow infections. The early experimental work in scrapie is briefly reviewed. Biochemical changes in brain that are characteristic of scrapie are summarized. Recent physicochemical studies of the properties of the scrapie agent are considered in relation to the biological nature of the scrapie agent. The repli-cation of the scrapie agent is discussed in terms of viral and membrane hypotheses of scrapie and in the light of recent genetic studies of mouse scapie. The concept of slow infections, which was first introduced by Sigurdsson [1], has been fruitful of much interesting research. However, Sigurdsson's concept was based largely on a study of a limited number of diseases prevalent in his native Iceland, and were he alive today it is probable that he would have wished to modify and extend his main criteria for distinguishing slow infections from acute and chronic disorders. He considered the main characteristics of slow infections to be: (1) an initial long period of incubation of many months or years without overt sign of clinical disease; (2) a rather regular, protracted clinical phase of the disease with serious sequelae, often death; and (3) limitation of infection to a single host species and localization of lesions within a single organ or tissue system. Sigurdsson's list of slow infections included pulmonary adenomatosis, <b>maedi,</b> <b>visna,</b> <b>and</b> scrapie (rida) of sheep, mam-mary carcinoma and leukemia of mice, avian lymphoblastosis, and the Rous sarcoma.

The present study was aimed to establish a sequence database in a conserved region of the viral genome which can then serve to perform phylogenetic analysis. Three hundred and seventy six nucleotides (dUTPase- integrase) region of the pol gene of GrSRLV from different mixed flocks were obtained by semi-nested PCR using degenerate primers. GrSRLV showed 79 and 81 % homology in their nucleotides and deduced amino acids sequences respectively. Molecular epidemiology based on the pol sequences indicated that GrSRLV contains both type A and B viruses and the occurrence of five genetically different clusters of SRLV circulating in Greece. The results suggest that GrA-SRLV have a different origin from that of British, Icelandic and South African SRLV reference strains.

40|$|Caprine {{arthritis}} encephalitis virus (CAEV) is a lentivirus {{closely related}} to <b>visna</b> virus <b>and</b> more distantly to other lentiviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus. The genomes of <b>visna</b> virus <b>and</b> <b>CAEV</b> contain a tat gene encoding a protein able to weakly transactivate its own long terminal repeat, suggesting that transactivation may be a dispensable function for viral replication. Three different tat gene mutants of an infectious molecular clone of CAEV were used to study their replication after transfection or infection of primary goat synovial membrane cells and of blood-derived mononuclear cells or macrophages. Our results showed no difference between replication of the wild type and either the complete tat deletion mutant or the tat stop point mutant, whereas slower growth kinetics {{and lower levels of}} expression of the partial tat deletion mutant that of the wild type were obtained in these cells. Quantitative PCR and reverse transcription-PCR analyses of the different steps of a single replicative cycle revealed an identical pattern of retrotranscription, transcription, and viral production, whereas time course analysis demonstrated that the intracellular level of viral genomic RNA was affected by the partial tat deletion at later time points. We then compared the infectious properties of the wild-type and tat mutant viruses in vivo by direct inoculation of proviral DNAs into the joints of goats. All the animals seroconverted between 27 and 70 days postinoculation. Moreover, we were able to isolate tat mutant CAEV from blood-derived macrophages that was still able to infect synovial membrane cells in vitro.

The biological activity of these clones was tested by ligation of the fragments followed by transfection onto goat synovial membrane cells; infectious virus was recovered.

40|$|AbstractCaprine arthritis–encephalitis virus (CAEV) is {{a natural}} {{lentivirus}} pathogen of goats. CAEV, like {{all members of the}} ovine/caprine lentivirus family, has anin vivotropism for cells of the monocyte/macrophage cell lineage and activation of viral gene expression is observed only following differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. In addition to cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, <b>CAEV</b> <b>and</b> the closely related <b>maedi</b> <b>visna</b> virus of sheep (MVV) can also replicate productively in fibro-epithelial cells derived from synovial membrane of goats (GSM). However, these viruses varied greatly in their ability to replicate in fibroblasts. We studied the biological and biochemical properties of <b>CAEV</b> <b>and</b> maedi-visna virus (MVV) of sheep following inoculation into the three ovine/caprine cell types. Our data showed no substantial differences in virus titers, viral protein biosynthesis, or processing of the viral proteins between <b>CAEV</b> <b>and</b> MVV following inoculation into primary macrophages and GSM cells. However, unlike MVV, CAEV failed to replicate productively in ovine fibroblasts (sheep choroid plexus cells). This correlated with a specific but abnormal proteolytic cleavage of the envelope glycoprotein of the virus. This abnormal proteolytic cleavage represents a novel type of host cell restriction of lentivirus replication...|$|R

We have also studied the activation of caspases- 3, - 8 and - 9 by fluorescent assays in caprine cells expressing SRLV Tat proteins, and the effects of transfected dominant negative variants of these caspases, to show that Tat-associated apoptosis depends on activation of caspases- 3 and - 9, but not - 8.

40|$|Infections {{caused by}} the small {{ruminant}} lentiviruses (SRLV) of sheep (<b>maedi</b> <b>visna</b> virus) <b>and</b> goats (caprine arthritis encephalitis virus) are a serious economical threat to small ruminant farming particularly in the more intensive settings like dairy farms. Revenue is ultimately negatively influenced by decreased milk production, reduced birth-rate and bodyweight and trade limitations 1, 2, 3. Chronically infected animals have a poor body condition and may display progressive dyspnoea, painful arthritis and indurative mastitis, factors that markedly affect animal welfare. However, in well managed flocks overt clinical disease is hardly seen because affected animals are culled in {{an early stage of}} this perniciously progressive disease, hence the only sign is an increased replacement rate. The infection spreads lactogenically from dam to progeny through colostrum and/or milk and horizontally on one hand via the natural close contact between the dam and her progeny 4, 5 {{and on the other hand}} between flock members via direct and indirect contacts 6, 7. Vertical -prenatal- transmission is generally considered to be of low or no importance. Infections are microscopically characterised by lymphoid infiltrations and inflammatory lesions in the lungs, the udder, the carpal joints and the central nervous system 8, 9, 10. There is no cure for this usually slowly progressive disease. Identification of infected individuals by laboratory testing and strict farm and animal sanitary management are corner-stones of programs for control and are at the same time the only tools available for reducing the prevalence of infection. Caution with respect to the reliability of laboratory testing for SRLV infections is augmented by the growing knowledge of the RNA viral genomes and their expression products. Immense genetic heterogeneity hampers protein as well as viral genome based tests. Due to sub-optimal laboratory tests generating false negative results, an early diagnosis is easily missed which will lead to spread of infection. This reduces the farmers’ support for control programs which was already under pressure because of the costs involved, the low direct market returns and the ‘invisibility’ of the long-term returns. Improvement of the diagnostic tools combined with improved test strategies will enable early detection of infection. Moreover, especially, the use of milk samples in stead of blood and in particular the use of bulk milk samples for the antibody detection as well as the molecular biological detection of SRLV infections could lead to considerable cost reduction. The small ruminant lentiviruses, a subfamily of the retroviruses, will need continuous attention because they are prone to diagnostic test escape as a result of their rapid evolving genomes 7, 11, 12 with consequences at the genomic and epitope level 13. Thus, the use of complementary tests is currently required and molecular-epidemiological surveillance is a prerequisite...|$|R

40|$|Ovine and caprine lentiviruses {{share the}} {{capacity}} to induce slowly progressive and inflammatory diseases of {{the central nervous system}} (leukoencephalitis or visna), lungs (progressive pneumonia or maedi), and joints (arthritis) in their natural hosts. Studies on their replication indicated that ovine lentiviruses and caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) recently isolated in the United States establish persistent infection in ovine and caprine fibroblasts, whereas older prototype ovine lentiviruses such as Icelandic visna virus or American progressive pneumonia virus irreversibly lyse fibroblast cultures. Since all of the recent isolates were found to be persistent, Narayan et al. (J. Gen. Virol. 59 : 345 - 356, 1982) concluded that the highly lytic viruses were only tissue-culture-adapted strains. In the present report, we isolated new ovine lentiviruses from French sheep with naturally occurring progressive pneumonia which are either highly lytic (five isolates), as are the Icelandic strains of visna virus, or persistent (one isolate), as are CAEV or American persistent ovine lentiviruses. Protein and nucleic acid content analyses of these new highly lytic (type I) and persistent (type II) isolates indicated that type I and type II ovine lentiviruses were genetically distinct, type I and type II viruses being closely related to the Icelandic strains of <b>visna</b> virus <b>and</b> to <b>CAEV,</b> respectively. We conclude that (i) highly lytic ovine lentiviruses, such as the Icelandic prototype strains of <b>visna</b> virus <b>and</b> persistent lentiviruses more related to CAEV, are naturally present in the ovine species, and (ii) irreversible cell lysis induced by highly lytic viruses does not result from a tissue culture adaptation of field isolates that were originally persistent but is instead the consequence of a genetic content distinct from that of persistent viruses...|$|R

With the use of syncytia assays, infection-, inhibition- and enhancement studies, it was shown that CXCR 4 is not a common lentivirus receptor. U 87 and HOS cells, both celllines lacking CXCR 4, were susceptible to infection. However, cells transfected with CD 4 and CXCR 4 showed an increased syncytia formation and the presence of CD¤ and CXCR 4 augments virus-induced cell fusion.

ALDCs were also shown to present MVV GAG p 25 expressed by aroA-negative S. Abortusovis to CD 4 + T lymphocytes. Thus, the poor immune responses that Salmonella vaccines elicited in large animal models compared with mice are neither a result of an inability of Salmonella to infect large animal DCs nor an inability of these DCs to present delivered antigens. However, the low efficiency of infection of ALDC compared with macrophages or monocyte-derived DCs may account for the poor immune responses induced in large animal models...|$|R
40|$|Eight cesarean-derived goat {{kids were}} inoculated with caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (<b>CAEV),</b> <b>and</b> proliferative {{responses}} of their {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} to mitogens <b>and</b> <b>CAEV</b> antigen were monitored for 9 months. Antibody specific for CAEV {{was measured by}} an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Five cesarean-derived noninfected goats were tested simultaneously. Significant differences between the infected and control mononuclear cell proliferation reactions to CAEV began 14 days post-inoculation and continued in a fluctuant manner until 134 days post-inoculation. The magnitude of the proliferative reaction steadily increased in infected goats {{until the end of the}} experiment at 271 days post-inoculation. Responses to mitogens were not significantly different between infected and control goats. Virus-inoculated goats produced CAEV-specific antibody that reached a maximum level between 49 and 77 days post-inoculation and then declined to lower levels through 271 days post-inoculation. The virus-inoculated goats developed mild but characteristic clinical evidence of caprine arthritis-encephalitis, <b>and</b> <b>CAEV</b> was reisolated from four goats at 286 days post-inoculation. The five control goats developed neither an anti-CAEV immune response nor clinical disease, <b>and</b> <b>CAEV</b> could not be reisolated from them...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSmall {{ruminant}} lentiviruses (SRLV) cause different clinical {{forms of}} disease in sheep and goats. So far in Spain, <b>Maedi</b> <b>visna</b> virus-like (MVV-like) sequences {{have been found}} in both species, and the arthritic SRLV disease has never been found in sheep until a recent outbreak. Knowing that arthritis is common in goats, it was of interest to determine if the genetic type of the virus involved in the sheep arthritis outbreak was caprine arthritis encephalitis virus-like (CAEV-like) rather than MVV-like. Alignment and phylogenetic analyses on nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences from SRLV of this outbreak, allowed a B 2 genetic subgroup assignment of these SRLV, compatible with a correspondence between the virus genetic type and the disease form. Furthermore, an isolate was obtained from the arthritic outbreak, its full genome was CAEV-like but the pol integrase region was MVV-like. Although its LTR lacked a U 3 repeat sequence and had a deletion in the R region, which has been proposed to reduce viral replication rate, its phenotype in sheep skin fibroblast cultures was rapid/high, thus it appeared to have adapted to sheep cells. This outbreak study represents the first report on CAEV-like genetic findings and complete genome analysis among Spanish small ruminants...|$|R
40|$|<b>Maedi</b> <b>Visna</b> Virus (MVV) is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} a systemic disease of sheep, which causes lesions in lungs, {{the central nervous}} system, joints, and mammary glands. It has been speculated that the association with Brucella ovis {{may lead to the}} venereal shedding of the virus. In this work, samples of epididymis from ten rams positive for MVV and infected experimentally with Brucella ovis, were subjected to liquid- phase PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ PCR tests, aimed at identifying the pathogens in a tissue context. IHC was carried out using a monoclonal antibody raised against p 28 MVV protein and a polyclonal antibody to B. ovis. Liquid phase- and in situ PCR were designed to amplify a portion of MVV proviral DNA Pol sequence. In the animals showing B. ovis-related histopathological changes, IHC clearly demonstrated a positivity for B. ovis and MVV in interstitial and epithelial ductal cells. In situ PCR assessed the presence of MVV proviral DNA in macrophages and elements inside the epithelium. The unaffected and reagent control samples constantly gave negative results. Taken together, these data demonstrate that MVV may affect ovine epididymis, apparently taking advantage of the concurrent infection by B. ovis. The tropism of MVV for the epididymal epithelial cells, may be responsible for its excretion with the semen...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrimate {{lentivirus}} (HIV and SIV) vpr accessory genes encode 12 - to 14 -kDa proteins which induce {{cell cycle}} arrest at the G 2 phase of infected cells, {{preventing them from}} going through mitosis. Members of the HIV- 2 /SIVmac/SIVsmm group also encode a second closely related accessory protein called Vpx. Vpx and HIV Vpr are critical for virus replication in nondividing cells due to their participation in nuclear import of the preintegration complex. Caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (<b>CAEV)</b> <b>and</b> <b>maedi</b> <b>visna</b> virus are the natural lentiviruses of domestic goat and sheep, respectively, and their genomes do not carry vpr and vpx genes. In this study, we generated chimeric CAEV-based genomes carrying vpr and vpx genes from SIVmac 239 and tested their ability to induce G 2 cell cycle arrest in infected caprine cells. CAEV–pBSCAvpxvpr is the chimeric genome that was shown to be infectious and replication competent. Our data demonstrated that CAEV–pBSCAvpxvpr-infected goat synovial membrane cell monolayer developed more cytopathic effects and {{a high proportion of}} cells remained in the G 2 phase of cell cycle. This G 2 arrest was observed both at the early and at the late stages of infection, while minimal effect was observed with the parental CAEV–pBSCA. These results, described {{for the first time in}} mammalian cells other than those of primates, indicate that Vpr-induced G 2 cell cycle arrest is not restricted to only primate cells. Thus, conservation of Vpx/Vpr protein functions in caprine cells suggests a possible role for these proteins in the virus life cycle and its ability to adapt to new hosts. The data presented here thus raise a pertinent question about the biological significance of the conservation of Vpr and Vpx functions in caprine cells despite the high phylogenic distance between primates and small ruminants...|$|R
40|$|Visna is a {{neurological}} disease {{due to the}} <b>Maedi</b> <b>Visna</b> Virus (MVV) infection in sheep. The MVV infection {{is characterized by a}} long incubation period and sheep from 2 to 4 years of age are the most frequently affected. MVV usually causes a worldwide diffused respiratory disease called Maedi, consisting in lymphoproliferative pneumonia. The nervous form, called <b>Visna,</b> is unusual <b>and</b> no cases have been so far reported in Turkey. This work describes a severe Visna case in a lamb from a Turkish flock. A 10 months old male Merino lamb from a Turkish flock of 850 sheep suddenly showed nervous signs. A history of other four similar cases was recorded in the farm. The lamb died within 2 days after the first clinical signs and was submitted to the necropsy. Lung congestion and pneumonia were observed. In the CNS, the meninges appeared congested but some parts were discolored especially in the cerebellum region. In the left brain hemisphere, a Coenurus cerebralis cyst was found. Microscopically, severe non-purulent meningoencephalitis and lymphoproliferative pneumonia were observed. In order to detect MVV by PCR, the DNA was extracted from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded slides from the lung and the CNS. After the integrity of the extracted DNA was verified by PCR for the ovine mitochondrial DNA, a PCR for the LTR gene of MVV was carried out. MVV provirus was demonstrated in all the pulmonary and nervous samples collected. This is the first case of Visna reported in Turkey. Visna usually affects adult sheep and, in this case, it was surprising to find such severe neurological lesions in a young animal. These observations could depend on infection by a particularly virulent and neurotropic MVV strain or on the concurrent infection observed in the CNS...|$|R
40|$|<b>Visna</b> <b>and</b> {{progressive}} pneumonia virus (PPV), two antigenically related, non-oncogenic “slow viruses” {{which have}} ribonucleic acid (RNA) -dependent deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase activity, were examined {{for their ability}} to transform cells. Murine cells which had been exposed to either visna or PPV developed foci of altered, spindle-shaped cells 3 to 4 weeks after infection. <b>Visna</b> <b>and</b> PPV transformed lines were established from these cultures. There was no evidence that other oncogenic DNA or RNA viruses were involved in the observed transformation. Visna or PPV could be “rescued” from all transformed lines by co-cultivation with normal sheep testis cells. “Rescued” virus was identified as <b>visna</b> or PPV, <b>and</b> they retained the capacity to transform mouse cells. These experiments may have important implications in the understanding of both viral carcinogenesis and “slow” viral infections...|$|R
