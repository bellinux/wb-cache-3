5|$|A 30 Days of Night/The X-Files {{cross-over}} graphic {{novel was}} published by WildStorm in 2010. It follows Mulder and Scully to Alaska as they investigate a series of grisly murders that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> vampires.|$|E
5|$|There {{are local}} stories of tunnels {{stretching}} from Dunstanburgh Castle to Craster Tower, Embleton and Proctor Steads, {{as well as}} a tunnel running from the castle well {{to the west of the}} castle. These stories <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the presence of the drainage system around the castle.|$|E
5|$|In either 549 or 550, the Gepids and Lombards again marched {{against each}} other but, {{according}} to Procopius, both armies panicked and no battle took place. As a result, a new war was avoided and Thurisind accepted Audoin's request for a two-year truce. According to István Boná, the panic <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> a natural phenomenon: a lunar eclipse took place on June 25/26, 549.|$|E

5|$|Several species show clumped distributions. Dispersal {{limitation}} {{has been}} invoked {{to explain the}} clumped distribution of adults and limited recruitment of seedlings in both A.erinacea in Ecuador and A.minima in Puerto Rico. Similarly, the rarity of A.lindeniana and A.simplex in Colombian forests <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> limited seed production and the limited effectiveness of seed dispersal by avian and mammalian frugivores.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} ceramic evidence excavated at Buena Vista {{dates to}} {{the very end of the}} Early Preclassic period, indicating that the site was initially settled at the transition between the Early and Middle Preclassic periods. The long occupational history of Buena Vista <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> its proximity to chert-rich hills. Excavations have revealed evidence of chert workshops dedicated to the production of tools, together with dumps of waste flakes.|$|E
5|$|Hemorrhagic cystitis, {{characterized}} by {{blood in the}} urine, can occur secondary {{to a number of}} causes including: infections, radiation therapy, underlying cancer, medications and toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in the bladder wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection. Its cause is not entirely clear; however, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin and}} the history of the chapel are obscure, but it was {{certainly}} built no later than the early 15th century, as in 1426 it is recorded that the Pope gave money for its repair. The chapel <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the Preceptory of St. Anthony, a skin hospice, which was based in Leith around this time. It <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the nearby Holyrood Abbey.|$|R

5|$|Quiriguá {{suffered}} a hiatus from {{the turn of}} the 6th century that lasted through {{to the middle of the}} 7th century. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the Tikal hiatus of the Middle Classic caused by Tikal's defeat by Calakmul. There is evidence that Quiriguá {{suffered a}}n attack by unknown enemies in this period, as demonstrated by the apparently deliberate defacement of Stela U and Monument26, characteristic of damage inflicted by invading warriors. No monuments were erected during this hiatus, which lasted from 495 to 653.|$|E
5|$|In the 8th century AD {{the city}} had {{important}} relationships with Maya cities to the southwest, especially in the Petexbatún region, and on the Pasión and Usumacinta rivers, including Seibal (on the Pasión), Altar de Sacrificios (near where the Pasión becomes the Usumacinta), and Dos Pilas, Aguateca, Tamarindito, Arroyo de Piedra and Cueva de Sangre (all five in the Petexbatún region). It {{is possible that the}} widespread distribution of Ik-style ceramics in elite tombs at sites in the Petexbatún region <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the military defeat of Motul de San José by Dos Pilas, with these high quality ceramics forming a part of the tribute payment made to the Petexbatún kingdom. After its defeat {{at the hands of the}} Petexbatún kingdom, Motul de San José no longer erected sculpted stelae but the history of the site continued to be recorded to a certain extent in texts on Ik-style ceramics.|$|E
5|$|This nuthatch's {{responses}} to predators <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> a reproductive strategy. A study compared the white-breasted nuthatch with the red-breasted nuthatch {{in terms of}} the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of predators. The models were of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, and a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities, while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E

5000|$|The group <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the little-known {{group called}} [...] "Tawhid and Jihad in Syria", {{and may have}} {{influenced}} the Palestinian resistance group in Gaza called Tawhid and Jihad Brigades.|$|R
50|$|Spindle neurons {{may develop}} {{abnormally}} {{in people with}} autistic disorders, and abnormalities <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> schizophrenia and frontotemporal lobe degeneration, but research into these correlations is {{at a very early}} stage.|$|R
5|$|For the few {{species on}} which data are available, the average {{nuthatch}} lifespan {{in the wild}} is between 2 and 3.5years, although ages of up to 10 years have been recorded. The Eurasian nuthatch has an adult annual survival rate of 53% and the male Corsican nuthatch 61.6%. Nuthatches and other small woodland birds share the same predators: accipiters, owls, squirrels and woodpeckers. An American study showed that nuthatch responses to predators <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> reproductive strategies. It measured the willingness of males of two species to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, or a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy {{during the dry}} season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|E
5|$|Stelae were {{considered}} to be invested with holiness and, perhaps, even to contain a divine soul-like essence that almost made them living beings. Some were apparently given individual names in hieroglyphic texts and {{were considered}} to be participants in rituals conducted at their location. Such rituals in the Classic Period appear to have included a k'altun binding ritual, in which the stela was wrapped in bands of tied cloth. This ritual was closely tied to the k'atun-ending calendrical ceremony. A k'altun ritual is depicted carved onto a peccary skull deposited as a funerary offering at Copán, the scene shows two nobles flanking a stela-altar pair where the stela seems to have been bound with cloth. The act of wrapping or binding a sacred object was of considerable religious importance across Mesoamerica, and is well attested among the Maya right up to the present day. The precise meaning of the act is not clear, but may be to protect the bound object or to contain its sacred essence. The binding of stelae <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the modern K'iche' Maya practice of wrapping small divinatory stones in a bundle.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} {{suggest that}} the evolution of luminous lenticular galaxies <b>may</b> <b>be</b> closely <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> that of elliptical galaxies, whereas fainter lenticulars might be more closely associated with ram-pressure stripped spiral galaxies.|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the role of killer whales in marine ecosystems, descriptions of their diet are vital, yet this aspect is poorly known in Subantarctic killer whales. During 823 sightings of killer whales at Subantarctic Marion Island (2006 – 2009) we recorded 48 predation events; in only 10 cases could prey be identified. Killer whales fed on fur seals, elephant seals and penguins. Constant effort (dedicated) observations (259 hours, 2008 - 2009) showed that killer whale abundance, which peaked in September- December with a secondary peak in April- <b>May,</b> <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the abundance of seals and penguins...|$|R
5000|$|According to Bob Henson from Wunderground, {{inflow of}} {{low-level}} {{moisture from the}} Gulf of Mexico and the combination of very slow moving large-scale storm systems {{set the stage for}} the floods. He added,"Upper-level winds were largely aligned with the low-level frontal zone, an ideal setup for “thunderstorm training” (successive downpours over the same area). In addition, rains were concentrated by several mesoscale convective vortices, small-scale centers of low-pressure that developed along the frontal bands, in some cases resembling mini-tropical cyclones." [...] The stationary trough during <b>May</b> <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> both the El Niño and amplified midlatitude short-wave train.|$|R

25|$|In 2014, a study {{indicated}} that some breed-temperaments, such as anxiety or fear, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> gene mutations. Other temperaments {{may be due to}} the legacies of 'ancient' ancestry.|$|E
25|$|Functional {{validation}} of key genes {{is an important}} consideration for post transcriptome planning. Observed gene expression patterns <b>may</b> <b>be</b> functionally <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> a phenotype by an independent knock-down/rescue study in the organism of interest.|$|R
50|$|A justice hill survives in a {{patch of}} {{woodland}} on the Hag Burn near the Loudoun Country Club. This site <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the old Barony of Galston and the feudal rights of the Campbells of Loudoun.|$|R
50|$|Thresholds <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the {{spending}} power of customers; {{this is most}} obvious in periodic markets in poor countries, where wages are so low that people can buy the goods or services only once in a while.|$|R
25|$|Proponents of {{the concept}} argue that anti-Zionism, anti-Americanism, anti-globalization, third worldism, and demonization of Israel, or double {{standards}} applied to its conduct, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> antisemitism, or constitute disguised antisemitism.|$|E
25|$|Climate {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} the unusual weather leading to the floods <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> this year's appearance of La Nina in the Pacific Ocean, and the jet stream being further south than normal.|$|E
25|$|On August 21, 2013 the United States State Department {{issued a}} {{security}} message warning U.S. citizens in or traveling to Cuba about {{an outbreak of}} cholera in Havana, that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> a reported outbreak of cholera in eastern Cuba.|$|E
50|$|Some organisations {{appraise}} non-executive directors {{on general}} overall performance criteria {{such as in}} the Higgs Report, as above, whereas others in addition set specific individual objectives, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> specifically <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the overall organisation goals.|$|R
50|$|Variation in {{optimism}} and pessimism is somewhat heritable and reflects biological trait systems to some degree.
