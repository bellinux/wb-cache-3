Ocular morbidities by its sheer magnitude form an enormous problem, not only in human suffering, but {{also in terms of}} economical loss and social burden. Aim: The aim of present study was to find the prevalence of ocular morbidities in rural area. Methods: Community based cross-sectional study in area covered by Rural Health Training Centre (RHTC), Hingna which is under the administrative control of Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Indira Gandhi Government Medical College [IGGMC], Nagpur, was carried out in 194 families with 925 study subjects during February 2005 -December 2005. The study focuses on ocular examination and diagnosis of ocular <b>morbid</b> <b>conditions.</b> Both eyes were examined and all the relevant clinical findings were recorded in predesigned proforma. Chi Square test was used for the analysis of data. Results: The results revealed that out of 925 study subjects 297 (32. 11 %) were had ocular morbidity. Common ocular morbidity was Myopia (13. 62 %), Conjunctival xerosis (12. 11 %), Hypermetropia (11. 68 %), Xerophthalmia (3. 46 %), Pterygium (2. 92 %), immature senile cataract (2. 70 %), Eye strain (2. 49 %), mature senile cataract (1. 84 %) and Presbyopia (0. 86 %). Females were more affected (36. 58 %) as compared to males (28. 37 %), [χ 2 = 7. 09; d. f. = 1, P< 0. 05]. It was observed that as the age increases the prevalence of ocular morbidity increases [χ 2 = 318. 03; d. f = 7, p< 0. 001]. Higher prevalence of ocular <b>morbid</b> <b>conditions</b> was found in Illiterates 122 (40. 94 %) [χ 2 = 16. 47; d. f. = 3, p< 0. 001] Conclusion: High prevalence of ocular morbidities was found in rural areas of central India with greater predominance among women and illiterates...|$|R

The method of simple observation would compare instances of recovery, to find whether they agreed in having been preceded by the administration of mercury; or would compare instances of recovery with instances of failure, to find cases which, agreeing in all other respects, differed only in the fact that mercury had been administered, or that it had not.|$|E

What else {{there is to}} him of trunk and limbs and organs he has {{neglected}} until it has all fallen into decay. His very lack of personal cleanliness, the squalor in which he lives, the insufficient sleep which he allows himself, his habit of careless feeding at irregular intervals, all have their source in his contempt for the physical part of him. This talented man of varied attainments, accomplished linguist, skilled physician, able naturalist and profound psychologist, lives in his intellect alone, impatient of all physical interruptions.

For I had introduced one Tom Towers as being potent among the contributors to the Jupiter, under which name I certainly did allude to the Times. But at that time, living away in Ireland, I had not even heard the name of any gentleman connected with the Times newspaper, and could not have intended to represent any individual by Tom Towers. As I had created an archdeacon, so had I created a journalist, and the one creation was no more personal or indicative of morbid tendencies than the other.

40|$|Objective: India has {{the second}} largest {{diabetic}} population in the world. The chronic nature {{of the disease and}} high prevalence of co-existing chronic medical conditions or ªco morbiditiesº makes diabetes management complex for the patient and for health care providers. Hence a strong need was felt to explore the problem of co morbidity among diabetics and its dimensions in primary health care practices. Method: This cross sectional survey was carried out on 912 type 2 diabetes patients attending different urban primary health care facilities at Bhubaneswar. Data regarding existence of co morbidity and demographical details were elicited by a predesigned, pretested questionnaire ªDiabetes Co morbidity Evaluation Tool in Primary Care (DCET- PC) º. Statistical analyses were done using STATA. Results: Overall 84 % had one ormore than one comorbid condition. The most frequent co <b>morbid</b> <b>conditions</b> were hypertension [62 %], acid peptic disease [28 %], chronic back ache [22 %] and osteoarthritis [21 %]. The median number of co <b>morbid</b> <b>conditions</b> among both males and females is 2 [IQR = 2]. The range of the number of co <b>morbid</b> <b>conditions</b> was wider among males [0 - 14] than females [0 - 6]. The number of co morbidities was highest in the age group > = 60 across both sexes. Most of the male patients below 40 years of age had either single [53 %] or three co morbidities [11 %] whereas among female patients of the same age group single [40 %] or two co morbidities [22 %] were more predominantly present. Age was found to be a strong independent predictor for diabetes co morbidity. The odds of having co morbidity among people above poverty line and schedule caste were found to be [OR = 3. 50; 95 %CI 1. 85 - 6. 62]and [OR = 2. 46; CI 95 % 1. 16 - 5. 25] respectively. Odds were increased for retired status [OR = 1. 21; 95 % CI 1. 01 - 3. 91] and obesity [OR = 3. 96; 95 %CI 1. 01 - 15. 76]. Conclusion: The results show a high prevalence of co morbidities in patients with type 2 diabetes attending urban primary health care facilities. Hypertension, acid peptic disease, chronic back ache and arthritis being the most common, strategies need to be designed taking into account the multiple demands of co morbidities.
