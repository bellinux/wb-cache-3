40|$|This paper {{presents}} a reliable machine vision system to automatically detect inserts and {{determine if they}} are broken. Unlike the machining operations studied in the literature, {{we are dealing with}} edge milling head tools for aggressive machining of thick plates (up to 12 centimetres) in a single pass. The studied cutting head tool is characterised by its relatively high number of inserts (up to 30) which makes the localisation of inserts a key aspect. The identification of broken inserts is critical for a proper tool monitoring system. In the method that we propose, we first localise the screws of the inserts and then we determine the expected position and orientation of the cutting edge by applying some geometrical operations. We compute the deviations from the expected cutting edge to the real edge of the inserts to determine if an insert is broken. We evaluated the proposed method on a new dataset that we acquired and made public. The obtained result (a harmonic mean of precision and recall 91. 43 %) shows that the machine vision system that we present is effective and suitable for the identification of broken inserts in <b>machining</b> <b>head</b> tools and ready to be installed in an on-line system...|$|E
40|$|Today in the {{production}} of internal combustion engines it is possible to make pistons as well as cylinders, for all practical purposes, perfectly round. The negative consequences of the subsequent assembly processes and operation of the engine is that the cylinders and pistons are deformed, resulting in a loss of power and an increase in fuel consumption. This problem can be solved by using an adaptronic tool, which can machine the cylinder to a predetermined non-round geometry, which will deform to the required geometry during assembly and operation of the engine. The article describes the actuatory effect of the tool in conjunction with its measuring and controlling algorithms. The adaptronic tool consists out the basic tool body and three axially-staggered floating cutter groups, these cutter groups consist out of guides, actuators and honing stones. The selective expansion of the tool is realised by 3 piezoelectric multilayer-actuators deployed in a series - paralle l arrangement. It is also possible to superimpose actuator expansion on the conventional expansion. A process matrix is created during the processing of the required and actual contour data in a technology module. This is then transferred over an interface to the machine controller where it is finally processed and the setting values for the piezoelectric actuators are derived, after which an amplifier generates the appropriate actuator voltages. A slip ring system on the driveshaft is used to transfer the electricity to the actuators in the <b>machining</b> <b>head.</b> The functioning of the adaptronic form-honing tool and process were demonstrated with numerous experiments. The tool provides the required degrees of freedom to generate a contour that correspond to the inverse compound contour of assembled and operational engines...|$|E

40|$|Balancing of {{machinery}} {{is a well}} known technical aspect of engineering which is practiced throughout the world. Many studies have been performed to optimize the models and methods used to make rotor balancing faster and more efficient. This thesis deals with the unique {{problems associated with the}} balancing of eccentrically designed spindles for the machine tool industry. Cobra Machine Tool Limited has designed and patented the newest form of combination face mill and grinder operation in North America. The study performed in this analysis provides a benchmark for further vibration studies by the company in the future. Standard vibration measurement equipment, available at the University of Windsor, was used to develop a testing and balancing procedure for this specific <b>machining</b> <b>head</b> and to demonstrate the method to others in the field. The methods employed as well as the final balancing procedures are outlined in the study for various areas of interest. The conclusions for the study were based on the in situ, balancing performed at Cobra Machine Tool for the prototype machine. Engineering design changes have been identified that will make any subsequent machines produced in the future, operate more smoothly and efficiently than the prototype machine. Other studies relating noise and vibration measurements and dynamic modeling, have been included for the completeness of the study. Dept. of Mechanical, Automotive, and Materials Engineering.

40|$|AbstractAs {{the aged}} {{population}} grows around the world, many medical instruments and devices {{have been developed}} recently. Among the devices, a drug delivery stent is a medical device which requires precision machining. Conventional drug delivery stent has problems of residual polymer and decoating because the drug is coated {{on the surface of}} stent with the polymer. If the drug is impregnated in the micro sized holes on the surface, the problems can be overcome because {{there is no need to}} use the polymer anymore. Micro sized holes are generally fabricated by laser machining; however, the fabricated holes do not have a high aspect ratio or a good surface finish. To overcome these problems, we propose a vibration-assisted machining mechanism with PZT (Piezoelectric Transducers) for the fabrication of micro sized holes. If the mechanism vibrates the eyepiece of the laser <b>machining</b> <b>head,</b> the laser spot on the workpiece will vibrate vertically because objective lens in the eyepiece shakes by the mechanism's vibration. According to the former researches, the vibrating frequency over 20 kHz and amplitude over 500 nm are preferable. The vibration mechanism has cylindrical guide, hollowed PZT and supports. In the cylinder, the eyepiece is mounted. The cylindrical guide has upper and low plates and side wall. The shape of plates and side wall are designed to have high resonating frequency and large amplitude of motion. The PZT is also selected to have high actuating force and high speed of motion. The support has symmetrical and rigid configuration. The mechanism secures linear motion of the eyepiece. This research includes sensitivity analysis and design of ultrasonic vibration mechanism. As a result of design, the requirements of high frequency and large amplitude are achieved...|$|E
40|$|High {{precision}} miniature and micro products which possess 3 D complex structures or free-form {{surfaces are}} now being widely used in industry. These micro products require to be fabricated by several machining processes and the integration of these various machining processes onto one machine becomes necessary since this will help reduce realignment errors and also increase the machining efficiency. This thesis describes the development and testing of several hybrid machining approaches for machines which are typically used to produce micro products such as micro fluidic moulds, solar concentrator moulds, micro grooves in brittle materials and micro structured milling cutters. These are: (a) micro milling and laser deburring; (b) micro grinding involving laser pre-heating; (c) micro milling and laser polishing. The hybrid micro milling/ laser deburring process was tested during the fabrication of a micro fluidic injection mould. Micro burrs on the channel of micro fluidic mould generated during micro milling were completely removed by developed laser deburring process. This approach can achieve a good surface finish on a micro fluidic mould. The hybrid laser assisted micro grinding process was investigated by fabricating a set of micro grooves on brittle materials, including Al 2 O 3 and Si 3 N 4. The workpiece was pre-heated by laser to increase its temperature above that of the brittle to ductile transition phase interface. It was found that lower cutting forces were apparent in the grinding process when used to machine brittle materials. It was also found that laser assisted grinding helped achieve a very good surface finish and reduced subsurface damage. The final hybrid machining approach tested involved micro milling and laser polishing to fabricate solar concentrator moulds. Such a mould requires a good surface finish in order to accurately guide light focusing on a target. The laser polishing process was successfully used to remove any unwanted cutting marks generated by a previous micro milling process. Abstract iii As a novel extension to this hybrid machine world, a focussed ion beam (FIB) fabrication approach was researched regarding the generation of microstructures on the rake faces of milling cutters {{with the aim of}} reducing cutter cutting forces and increasing tool life. The tool wear resistance performance of these microstructured tools was evaluated through three sets of slot milling trials on a NAK 80 specimen with the results indicating that micro structured micro milling cutters of this kind can effectively improve the tool wear resistance performance. A microstructure in a direction perpendicular to the cutting edge was found to be the best structure for deferring tool wear and obtaining prolonged tool life. This approach can potentially be further integrated into a hybrid precision machine such that micro structure cutters can be fabricated in-situ using a laser machining process. The conceptual design of a 5 -axis hybrid machine which incorporates micro milling, grinding and laser machining has been proposed as a test-bed for the above hybrid micro machining approach. Through finite element analysis, the best configuration was found to be a closed-loop vertical machine which has one rotary stage on the worktable and another on <b>machining</b> <b>head.</b> In this thesis, the effectiveness of these novel hybrid machining approaches have been fully demonstrated through machining several microproducts. Recommendations for future work are suggested to focus on further scientific understanding of hybrid machining processes, the development of a laser repairing approach and the integration of a controller for the proposed hybrid machine...|$|E
