5|$|Until this point, all {{the printed}} {{material}} (<b>mostly</b> <b>just</b> charts {{of the alphabet}} and its standard orthography equivalents) had been produced with large wooden type, which was not suitable for printing at small sizes. Because the alphabet was wholly unique, no font existed, so in 1857 {{the board of regents}} appointed Erastus Snow to procure metal type from St. Louis-based font foundry Ladew & Peer. However, in May 1857 the Utah War began, and Snow left St. Louis to support the Mormon pioneers. During the war, Ladew & Peer kept working on the type, and the punches and matrices were delivered in the winter of 1858. The first use of the new type was to make a business card for George A. Smith, an early Mormon historian.|$|E

25|$|The {{content of}} the OED2 is <b>mostly</b> <b>just</b> a {{reorganization}} of the earlier corpus, but the retypesetting provided an opportunity for two long-needed format changes. The headword of each entry was no longer capitalized, allowing the user to readily see those words that actually require a capital letter. Murray had devised his own notation for pronunciation, there being no standard available at the time, whereas the OED2 adopted the modern International Phonetic Alphabet. Unlike the earlier edition, all foreign alphabets except Greek were transliterated.|$|E
25|$|The {{designs of}} the coins have changed very little since 1879. Among the notable changes were new {{designs for the}} 5 franc coins in 1888, 1922, 1924 (minor) and 1931 (<b>mostly</b> <b>just</b> a size reduction). A new design for the bronze coins was used from 1948. Coins {{depicting}} a ring of stars (such as the 1 franc coin seen beside this paragraph) were altered from 22 stars to 23 stars in 1983; since the stars represent the Swiss cantons, the design was updated when in 1979 Jura seceded from the Canton of Bern and became the 23rd canton of the Swiss Confederation.|$|E
25|$|Earlier {{studies of}} mantle-derived rocks from many places {{have shown that}} {{hydrocarbons}} from the mantle region can be found widely around the globe. However, the content of such hydrocarbons in such rocks are extremely low and seem to lack accumulation in concentrations that would render them feasible for exploitation. Scientific consensus {{on the origin of}} oil and gas is that all natural oil and gas deposits on Earth are fossil fuels and are, therefore, biogenic. Globally significant amounts of abiotic oil in the crust can even be ruled out. Yet, abiogenesis of small quantities of oil and gas remains an area of ongoing research in limited, <b>mostly</b> <b>just</b> laboratory, scale.|$|E

25|$|The Russian advance was swift. On {{the first}} day of the war they had {{captured}} the town of Lovisa and besieged the Swedish seafortress of Svartholm. Borgå was captured on 24 February and Helsingfors on 2 March. Abandoned Swedish fortifications Hangö Peninsula were taken and manned on 21 March and on the same day the Russian army took Åbo while a small detachment was sent to Åland. Before the end of March 1808 even Vasa was taken. In Savolax Russians also advanced rapidly and took Kuopio on 16 March. Swedish forces had <b>mostly</b> <b>just</b> withdrawn before the advancing Russian often destroying usable materials. For example, the Swedish archipelago fleets ships that been docked in Åbo (nearly 50 gun sloops) were torched to prevent their capture.|$|E
25|$|Females usually {{give birth}} to a single infant, {{although}} twins do occur. Most births occur during the night. Infants are born with thin, dark brown or black hair and pale skin. Infants spend their first week attach themselves to their mothers' chests and <b>mostly</b> <b>just</b> suckle or sleep. They do not move much in terms of locomotion for {{the first two weeks of}} their life. As they approach their sixth week of life, infants vocalize more. They use squeaks and shrieks to communicate stress. In the following months, the infants are capable of quadrupedal locomotion and can walk, run and jump by the second and third months. Alloparenting occurs among langurs, starting when the infants reach two years of age. The infant will be given to the other females of the group. However, if the mother dies, the infant usually follows. Langurs are weaned by 13 months.|$|E
25|$|The {{book does}} not limit itself to tedious records of battle because Al-Biruni found the social culture {{to be more}} important. The work {{includes}} research on {{a vast array of}} topics of Indian culture, including descriptions of their traditions and customs. Although he tried to stay away from political and military history, Biruni did indeed record important dates and noted actual sites of where significant battles occurred. Additionally, he chronicled stories of Indian rulers and told of how they ruled over their people with their beneficial actions and acted {{in the interests of the}} nation. But, his details are brief and <b>mostly</b> <b>just</b> list rulers without referring to their real names. He did not go on about deeds that each one carried out during their reign, which keeps in line with Al-Biruni's mission to try to stay away from political histories. Al-Biruni also described the geography of India in his work. He documented different bodies of water and other natural phenomena. These descriptions are useful to today's modern historians because they are able to use Biruni's scholarship to locate certain destinations in modern-day India. Historians are able to make some matches while also concluding that certain areas seem to have disappeared and been replaced with different cities. Different forts and landmarks were able to be located, legitimizing Al-Biruni's contributions with their usefulness to even modern history and archeology.|$|E

500|$|IGN gave a more mixed {{review of}} Dignity, giving it 6.9 out of 10. They praised {{what they felt}} was Duff's more mature image, but {{ultimately}} claimed, [...] "Duff is still Duff and her music is still running the standard pop line." [...] PopMatters noted that the synthesizers used on the album's tracks failed to disguise Duff's speak-singing. The website believed her vocals {{were not on the}} level of her pop music peers such as Kelly Clarkson and Mandy Moore. [...] "Nevertheless," [...] they added, [...] "thanks to the miracle of processing, reverb effects, and multi-tracking tricks to beef up her vocals, Duff's voice is still sweetly candy-coated enough to make the medicine go down." [...] Slant Magazine said, [...] "Duff is <b>mostly</b> <b>just</b> an anonymous voice for an assemblage of producers and songwriters. Which is perfectly acceptable for a self-proclaimed dance album, but Duff's voice is nondescript and her delivery is blank; the impish, quirky, or coolly disaffected vocal characteristics and sex appeal that make other dance-pop divas viable performers is nonexistent." [...] The website's review claimed that the album was not very adventurous, and noted that the pop rock [...] "Outside of You", which they felt was the catchiest song on Dignity, was not a dance song like the others.|$|E
500|$|Neela Debnath of The Independent commented {{positively}} on the show's continuing {{exploration of}} the Daleks and the more [...] "adult tone", praising {{the performance of the}} three leads. Radio Times writer Patrick Mulkern stated that it [...] "ticks all [...] boxes as a Doctor Who fan of more than 40 years standing", describing it as [...] "clever, fast, funny, eerie, surprising and tearjerking". Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the episode five out of five stars, calling it a [...] "strong, cinematically-minded series opener" [...] which succeeded in making the Daleks scary. He also praised Coleman's debut, Smith's performance, the special effects, and Amy and Rory's emotional subplot. io9 reviewer Charlie Jane Anders noted that the plot [...] "is <b>mostly</b> <b>just</b> an excuse to explore the Doctor's ongoing relationship with the Daleks, and to show how sad it's gotten". Both Anders and Mulkern (the latter citing a Doctor Who veteran, Katy Manning) noted that Oswin's fascination with eggs, required for making soufflés, is really just a mental trick to block out the [...] "exterminate" [...] ("eggs-terminate") conditioning; this literary device is woven throughout the episode as a series of subtle hints, as Rory is confused by a dormant Dalek, initially misinterpreting him as saying [...] "eggs".|$|E

HitFix's Alan Sepinwall declared that Cheryl was his favorite character on the show. In his review for [...] "El Secuestro", Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club felt that Greer's vocals were {{the highlight of the}} episode, and affirmed that she effectively portrayed the unstable characteristics of Cheryl. [...] "Greer is <b>mostly</b> <b>just</b> asked to say crazy things as Cheryl, and that’s fun, but she steps it up here, playing both Cheryl’s insanity and the part of her that’s a spoiled trust-fund kid who’s found a day job and has to ride the subway with a dwarf that freaks her out." [...] Likewise, Ian MacDonald of TV Overmind proclaimed that the writers [...] "found a great way to expand on ISIS' most emotionally unstable employees"; [...] "Cheryl, whose crazy has been escalated to an almost extreme," [...] MacDonald stated, [...] "seems almost justified in her maladjusted-ness. She's a billionaire heiress who owns an ocelot and drinks glue [...] Humor involving insane rich people just no getting it is usually pretty funny, and if anyone can pull it off, it's Adam Reed and [...] Greer."

In response to the appearance of Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie of the Flight of the Conchords, he stated: [...] "I have no idea if the writers wrote new songs for the two guys in Flight of the Conchords to sing [...] but the songs they sang were pretty weak." [...] Similarly, VanDerWerff was critical of the guest appearances of Michele, Riley, and Monteith, and stated: [...] "Bringing in the Glee kids to sing a take on [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] that was, frankly, awful <b>mostly</b> <b>just</b> felt like an attempt to have guest stars in nothing parts so they could be promoted. In contrast, Brad Trechak of TV Squad felt that the [...] "Elementary School Musical" [...] was an enjoyable start to the twenty-second season of the series, and retorted that the appearances of Clement and McKenzie was the highlight of the episode. Similarly, Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic wrote, [...] "We actually loved Bret and Jemaine doing what they do best last night: playing characterized versions of themselves.
