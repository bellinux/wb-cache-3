Presence of trap states lying around 0. 3 - 0. 4 eV above the valence band was demonstrated through spectral photocapacitance response under medium infrared radiation and through capacitance versus frequency measurements that show the typical response of trapping kinetics process. Differences in the experimental results between our test devices and standard p-i-n solar cells show that boron atoms are the main cause of charged defect formation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S. A.

40|$|The use and {{sustainability}} of miombo woodlands under community management was studied in north eastern Zimbabwe using Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) methods. The study especially focussed on benefits obtained from miombo woodlands, their seasonal variability and long-term changes of woodland {{resources in the}} Mangwende communal area so as to assess the sustainability of communal management of forest land in the study area. Like farmers everywhere in Southern Africa, people in the study region are largely dependent on resources found on communal and state owned lands. In the study area, communal woodlands were found to provide a large variety of benefits for local people, especially important during dry seasons, e. g. poles, fibre and thatching grasses, firewood, fodder and traditional medicines. Despite the rich variety of products, the availability of woodland resources has dramatically diminished during the last 30 years. This trend, {{which is expected to}} continue, has forced people to use <b>manufactured</b> <b>substitutes,</b> e. g. for medicinal, nutritional and heating purposes. Most of the few forested areas left in the region are heavily degraded, but still continuously under over-utilisation. Based on the collected data, it was evident that community management has not helped the environment to survive the increased land use pressure brought about by a growing population in the study area. It is, however, too simplistic to assume that community management has directly caused environmental degradation. In the case of forest cover loss, for example, population pressure has probably been a bigger reason for deforestation than failures in land management...|$|R
40|$|This Working Paper {{should not}} be {{reported}} as representing {{the views of the}} IMF. The views expressed in this Working Paper are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent those of the IMF or IMF policy. Working Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to further debate. A distinctive feature of market-provided services is that some of them have close substitutes at home. Households may therefore switch between consuming home and market services in response to changes in the real wage—the opportunity cost of working at home—and changes in the price of market services. In order to analyze and quantify the implications of this trade-off for monetary policy, I embed a household sector into an otherwise standard sticky price DSGE model, which I calibrate to the U. S. economy. The results of the model are twofold. At the sectoral level, household production augments the service sector's New Keynesian Phillips curve with a sizable extra component that co-moves negatively with the output gap term, lowering the incentive of service sector firms to change their prices. This mechanism endogenously amplifies the real effects of a monetary shock in that sector, unlike in the nondurable goods sector for which households cannot <b>manufacture</b> <b>substitutes</b> at home. At the aggregate level, household production also implies more sluggish prices and a stronger response of real macroeconomic variables to a monetary shock.

In this study, we use anodizing for creating nanotubes on the surface of porous titanium alloy bone <b>substitutes</b> <b>manufactured</b> using selective laser melting. Different sets of anodizing parameters (voltage: 10 or 20 V anodizing time: 30 min to 3 h) are used for anodizing porous titanium structures that were later heat treated at 500 °C. The nanotopographical features are examined using electron microscopy while the bioactivity of anodized surfaces is measured using immersion tests in the simulated body fluid (SBF). Moreover, the effects of anodizing and heat treatment on the performance of one representative anodized porous titanium structures are evaluated using in vitro cell culture assays using human periosteum-derived cells (hPDCs). It has been shown that while anodizing with different anodizing parameters results in very different nanotopographical features, i. e. nanotubes in the range of 20 to 55 nm, anodized surfaces have limited apatite-forming ability regardless of the applied anodizing parameters. The results of in vitro cell culture show that both anodizing, and thus generation of regular nanotopographical feature, and heat treatment improve the cell culture response of porous titanium. In particular, cell proliferation measured using metabolic activity and DNA content was improved for anodized and heat treated as well as for anodized but not heat-treated specimens. Heat treatment additionally improved the cell attachment of porous titanium surfaces and upregulated expression of osteogenic markers. Anodized but not heat-treated specimens showed some limited signs of upregulated expression of osteogenic markers. In conclusion, while varying the anodizing parameters creates different nanotube structure, it does not improve apatite-forming ability of porous titanium. However, both anodizing and heat treatment at 500 °C improve the cell culture response of porous titanium. status: publishe...|$|R
