5|$|A second expedition, {{under the}} praetor Publius Varinius, was then {{dispatched}} against Spartacus. For some reason, Varinius {{seems to have}} split his forces {{under the command of}} his subordinates Furius and Cossinius. Plutarch mentions that Furius commanded some 2,000 <b>men,</b> <b>but</b> neither the strength of the remaining forces, nor whether the expedition was composed of militia or legions, appears to be known. These forces were also defeated by the army of escaped slaves: Cossinius was killed, Varinius was nearly captured, and the equipment of the armies was seized by the slaves.|$|E

5|$|Although his {{original}} objective was solely {{to protect the}} Serb population against the Ustaše, Dangić quickly became {{an important factor in}} the conflict between the two groups in eastern Bosnia. The Germans sought to win Dangić over to collaboration in order to strengthen anti-Partisan operations in the region, where Dangić's Chetniks reportedly numbered about 10,000 <b>men,</b> <b>but</b> at this time neither Dangić nor any of Mihailović's other commanders had any arrangement with the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's {{actions as}} emperor were {{described}} as being especially harsh to the senate, to the nobility and to the equestrian order. According to Josephus, these actions led to several failed conspiracies against Caligula. Eventually, officers within the Praetorian Guard led by Cassius Chaerea succeeded in murdering the emperor. The plot is described as having been planned by three <b>men,</b> <b>but</b> many in the senate, army and equestrian order {{were said to have}} been informed of it and involved in it.|$|E

One of her spurned suitors, Soekatma, decides to ruin their relationship by telling Winanta that Koestini has spent all of her time chasing boys rather than studying.

During this period Chatwin became acquainted with Robert Mapplethorpe, who photographed him. Chatwin {{is one of the few}} men Mapplethorpe photographed fully clothed.

5|$|Sultan Ali's {{successor}} was Hamad bin Thuwaini, {{who became}} sultan in 1893. Hamad maintained {{a close relationship}} with the British, but there was dissent among his subjects over the increasing British control over the country, the British-led army and the abolition of the valuable slave trade. In order to control this dissent, the British authorities authorised the sultan to raise a Zanzibari palace bodyguard of 1,000 <b>men,</b> <b>but</b> these troops were soon involved in clashes with the British-led police. Complaints about the bodyguards' activities were also received from the European residents in Zanzibar Town.|$|E

5|$|The {{abortive}} {{attack on}} Montreal {{led to the}} full mobilization of local militia in Montreal, raising nearly 1,000 <b>men,</b> <b>but</b> they soon began to drift away. Carleton refused to organize an expedition in relief of Fort Saint-Jean, and the militia members from rural parishes eventually disbanded to attend to their harvests and the defense of their own homes. In November, the besieged fort's commander capitulated, opening the Americans' way to Montreal. Carleton fled the city, making his way to Quebec City, and Montgomery occupied Montreal without firing a shot on November 13.|$|E
