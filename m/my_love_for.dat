500|$|The {{opening line}} of the song Min'na saikō arigatō, K-k-k-kawaii, k-k-k-kawaii, is a {{reference}} to the Japanese Kawaii culture. Kawaii is Japanese for [...] "cute", and the word is popularly used to describe endearing physical characterizations in Manga and Japanese video games. She was later asked about the double meaning of the song, on account of the interchangeability of the sexual euphemisms 'kitty' and 'pussy', to which she responded, [...] "Obviously it's flirtatious and somewhat sexual, but it's genuinely about <b>my</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> Hello Kitty as well." [...] Additionally, she said at MuchMusic Awards, [...] "It's really fun [...] it's about a slumber party and loving the kitty." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{released}} Diamond Dreams in 2008. The {{album was}} a collaboration with Kent Goodson, pianist for country star George Jones. It tells baseball stories inspired by West's umpiring career. Goodson later said, [...] "As I {{look back on}} how this CD came together, I realize that I am a musician and Joe is an umpire. But his love for music and <b>my</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> baseball bonded us in this project." [...] Sports blogger Voodoo Brown described West as [...] "in creepmode from the gate." [...] Sportswriter Doug Miller said that the album was [...] "a fun, humorous and often touching collection of spoken-word gems in which the listener gets a perfect sampling of the true personality of Cowboy Joe West." ...|$|E

Laucke learned billiards from George Chenier, a fellow Montrealer and the North American snooker champion. The two faced each again four years later at the North American snooker championships in Montreal, where Laucke won the championship. Laucke recalled: [...] "Then I decided to leave snooker, I had done what I wanted to do... <b>My</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> the guitar was overwhelming. There was a lot more money in snooker, but snooker was just a passion, and music was my love." [...] Laucke used his snooker winnings to finance 110trips from Montreal to New York City to study the classical guitar with Franco-Spaniard Rolando Valdés-Blain.|$|E

500|$|While Clapton has {{commented on}} Harrison's [...] "cavalier" [...] {{attitude}} to {{his pursuit of}} Boyd in 1970, and Boyd has described her husband's behaviour as [...] "cold and indifferent", the song conveys his despair at the failure of their relationship. In his lyrics, Harrison revisits the weather-themed imagery of his late-period Beatles compositions [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Sun". Whereas the latter song conveyed optimism and rejuvenation, however, [...] "So Sad" [...] reflects the onset of winter and, in author Simon Leng's description, [...] "hope replaced with tiredness, sunshine supplanted by gloom". Author Bruce Spizer writes that the opening lines alone – [...] "Now the winter has come / Eclipsing the sun / That has lighted <b>my</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> some time" [...] – evoke [...] "the opposite emotions of [...] uplifting 'Here Comes the Sun'".|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} the shows {{revolves}} around Beyoncé's recording career, from her early childhood beginnings to the star she is today. She revealed, [...] "In the beginning, I'm gonna start out, sing and make it about my songwriting, my arrangements, my band and <b>my</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> music. Then, I'm gonna tell my story. This way, I can sing all of the hit songs, the songs that people want. But, it's a deeper meaning... these songs meant {{more than just the}} chorus that's catchy... it's my life." [...] Since the show was created last minute, there were many changes. Originally, the set list included, [...] "Ego", [...] "At Last", [...] "Listen", [...] "Ring the Alarm", and [...] "Upgrade U". These songs were later removed from the set list and a new one was added with additional instruments. The success of the show has led Wynn Resorts to ask Beyoncé to return as a residency act.|$|E
500|$|Johnny Depp as Ed Wood: Burton {{approached}} Depp and [...] "within 10 {{minutes of}} hearing about the project, I was committed," [...] the actor remembers. At the time, Depp was depressed about films and filmmaking. By accepting this part, {{it gave him a}} [...] "chance to stretch out and have some fun", and working with Martin Landau, [...] "rejuvenated <b>my</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> acting". Depp was already familiar with some of Wood's films through John Waters, who had shown him Plan 9 from Outer Space and Glen or Glenda. To get a handle on how to portray Wood, Depp studied the performance of Jack Haley as the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz, and the acting of Mickey Rooney, Ronald Reagan and Casey Kasem. He watched several Reagan speeches because the actor felt that [...] "he had a kind of blind optimism that was perfect for Ed Wood." [...] Depp also borrowed some of Kasem's cadence and [...] "that utterly confident, breezy salesman quality in his voice".|$|E

500|$|Dave Marsh, {{author of}} The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made, felt {{that with the}} coda of the song, Madonna {{transformed}} her record into an adult love song. William McKeen, author of Rock and Roll is Here to Stay: An Anthology, said that the song [...] "offered an aggressive sexuality for women". Maria Raha, author of Cinderella's Big Score: Women of the Punk and Indie Underground, said that with the song, [...] "Madonna brought a trunk full of trite lyrics on the long-standing tradition of pop music, love." [...] "Crazy for You" [...] was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at 1986 Grammy Awards, but lost to Whitney Houston's [...] "Saving All <b>My</b> <b>Love</b> <b>for</b> You". The song was ranked number 38 on VH1's [...] "100 Greatest Love Songs", and during the special {{it was revealed that}} [...] "Crazy for You" [...] was recorded in one take. In 2003, Madonna fans were asked to vote for their Top 20 Madonna singles of all time by Q; [...] "Crazy for You" [...] was allocated the eleventh spot.|$|E
500|$|Yeats's {{friendship}} with Gonne ended, yet, in Paris in 1908, they finally consummated their relationship. [...] "The {{long years of}} fidelity rewarded at last" [...] was how another of his lovers described the event. Yeats was less sentimental and later remarked that [...] "the tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul." [...] The relationship did not develop into a new phase after their night together, and soon afterwards Gonne wrote to the poet indicating that despite the physical consummation, they could not continue as they had been: [...] "I have prayed so hard to have all earthly desire taken from <b>my</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> you and dearest, loving you as I do, I have prayed and I am praying still that the bodily desire for me may be taken from you too." [...] By January 1909, Gonne was sending Yeats letters praising the advantage given to artists who abstain from sex. Nearly twenty years later, Yeats recalled the night with Gonne in his poem [...] "A Man Young and Old": ...|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{praised the}} {{development}} of Santana. Hankinson wrote, [...] "My goodness, Santana. It's {{as if all the}} writers sat around a room, identified the best lines of tonight's episode and then decided to give them all to Santana. Fantastic." [...] VanDerWerff called Santana the highlight of the episode: [...] "The best thing about this episode is Naya Rivera's work as Santana and the story the three writers have cooked up for her. Rivera's really come into her own this season, going from just a generic bitchy cheerleader to an actual character who has motivations and might be a better villain for the show than Sue." [...] He added, [...] "the storyline of Santana realizing {{she was in love with}} Brittany and, thus, is probably a lesbian has been nicely plotted and surprisingly deep. The reveal about Santana hasn't washed away her less savory qualities; indeed, it's heightened them, to a degree, as she struggles to be true to herself and still maintain her status as the hottest girl in school." [...] Jenna Mullins of E! Online wrote of Santana, [...] "This episode just cemented <b>my</b> <b>love</b> <b>for</b> her. The insult spew in the beginning of the episode was awesomely mean." [...] She also said that Santana's [...] "inner monologue is often more entertaining than other characters' outer monologues". CNN Lisa Respers France considered Santana the episode's highlight, and went on to write, [...] "She embraced her inner lesbian (sort of) and rattled off the best [...] like 'the only straight I am is straight-up [...]' You gotta love that." ...|$|E

500|$|She is {{also known}} for {{changing}} her physical appearance for each album by altering her mode of dress or hairstyle, creating a unique aesthetic that extends to {{all aspects of the}} album, from the album art to the live performances. She works closely with friend and photographer Maria Mochnacz to develop the visual style of each album. Around the time of To Bring You <b>My</b> <b>Love,</b> <b>for</b> example, Harvey began experimenting with her image and adopting a theatrical aspect to her live performances. Her former fashion style, which consisted of simple black leggings, turtleneck sweaters and Doc Martens boots, was replaced by ballgowns, catsuits, wigs and excessive make-up. She also began using stage props like a Ziggy Stardust-style flashlight microphone. She denied the influence of drag, Kabuki or performance art on her new image, a look she affectionately dubbed [...] "Joan Crawford on acid" [...] in an interview with Spin in 1996, but admitted that [...] "it's that combination of being quite elegant and funny and revolting, all at the same time, that appeals to me. I actually find wearing make-up like that, sort of smeared around, as extremely beautiful. Maybe that's just my twisted sense of beauty." [...] However, she later told Dazed & Confused magazine, [...] "that was kind of a mask. It was much more of a mask than I've ever had. I was very lost as a person, at that point. I had no sense of self left at all", and has never repeated the overt theatricality of the To Bring You My Love tour.|$|E
