5|$|Their early albums Burn <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>and</b> The More Things Change... show {{a groove}} metal and thrash metal approach, similar to bands like Pantera and Exhorder. The albums also {{featured}} technical drumming by Chris Kontos and Dave McClain. The band changed their musical {{direction for the}} albums The Burning Red (1999) and Supercharger (2001), which {{have been described as}} displaying a nu metal sound. These albums featured rapping by Robb Flynn and simpler guitar riffs, but retaining part of their aggressive sound. This change in direction resulted in criticism from many fans because of the popularity of nu metal at the time.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E

500|$|Twenty {{years of}} hard work, twenty years of fun and frolic and jolly companionship, twenty years of living in an {{atmosphere}} of tuneful nonsense, with the glare of the footlights in <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> the thunders of applause in my ears. [...] How terribly I should miss it all! [...] And domesticity, that all my life I had fled from, had caught me at last.|$|E
500|$|Present {{throughout}} the songs background {{is the use}} of violins and a choir, as well as guitar, string instruments, congas and a cajon. [...] However it does make subtle use of synths and electronic sounds. Musically and lyrically, it is influenced by Contemporary Christian music, and has a gospel feel, while including standard pop and R. The song opens with Bieber singing, [...] "And I pray" [...] over a keyboard, while the song's chorus repeats one simple refrain, [...] "I close <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> I can see a better day/ I close <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> pray." [...] In the lyrics, Bieber [...] "recognizes the pain and suffering in the world" [...] and then offers [...] "a passive solution" [...] through lines such as [...] "Children are crying / soldiers are dying / Some people don't have a home," [...] before compromising, [...] "I know there's sunshine beyond that rain / good times beyond that pain." [...] Vocally, Bieber's vocals are sung in a lower key compared to previous singles.|$|E
500|$|The {{risks of}} her {{profession}} were illustrated when on October 1833 she barely avoided {{being killed by}} a landslide that buried her black-and-white terrier, Tray, her constant companion when she went collecting. She wrote to a friend, Charlotte Murchison, in November of that year: [...] "Perhaps you will laugh when I say that {{the death of my}} old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> close to my feet ... it was but a moment between me and the same fate." ...|$|E

Because you don't realize how you're going to feel until you're put in that situation. I had the tears in <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> got kinda nervous. But as I got into it, I realized it was work, it was a job. I had to vocally conduct a legend." [...] Harris commented on the single, [...] "He's showing you, I'm still the Michael Jackson that did 'Billie Jean' and 'Rock With You' because 'Butterflies' really falls along those lines." ...|$|E
500|$|From Mahler's later {{comments}} on the symphony's gestation, {{it is evident that}} the four-movement plan was relatively short-lived. He soon replaced the last three movements with a single section, essentially a dramatic cantata, based on the closing scenes of Goethe's Faust, the depiction of an ideal of redemption through eternal womanhood (das Ewige-Weibliche). Mahler had long nurtured an ambition to set the end of the Faust epic to music, [...] "and to set it quite differently from other composers who have made it saccharine and feeble." [...] In comments recorded by his biographer Richard Specht, Mahler makes no mention of the original four-movement plans. He told Specht that having chanced on the Veni creator hymn, he had a sudden vision of the complete work: [...] "I saw the whole piece immediately before <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> only needed to write it down as though it were being dictated to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Thunderball was {{the third}} James Bond score {{composed}} by John Barry, after From Russia with Love and Goldfinger. The original title song was entitled [...] "Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", taken from an Italian journalist who in 1962 dubbed agent 007 as Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. The title theme was written by Barry and Leslie Bricusse; the song was originally recorded by Shirley Bassey, and later rerecorded by Dionne Warwick, whose version was not released until the 1990s. The song {{was removed from the}} title credits after producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were worried that a theme song to a James Bond film would not work well if the song did not have the title of the film in its lyrics. Barry then teamed up with lyricist Don Black and wrote [...] "Thunderball", which was sung by Tom Jones, who according to Bond production legend, fainted in the recording booth when singing the song's final note. Jones said of it, [...] "I closed <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> I held the note for so long when I opened my eyes the room was spinning." ...|$|E

500|$|Guandique faced {{a minimum}} penalty of 30 {{years to a}} maximum of life {{imprisonment}} without the possibility of parole. In seeking the maximum possible sentence, the prosecutors stated that Guandique [...] "is unable to control himself and thus, will always remain a danger to women". A memo submitted by the prosecution in February 2011 cited Guandique's harassment of female staff in prison, including soliciting a nurse and masturbating in front of guards. Assistant U.S. Attorney Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez disclosed that he had traveled to El Salvador with a detective to investigate allegations that Guandique had fled his native country because of suspected attacks against local women dating back to 1999. During the sentencing hearing on February 11, Guandique said to Levy's family, [...] "I am sorry for what happened to your daughter", and insisted on his innocence. Before Judge Gerald Fisher reminded Susan Levy to address the court instead of the defendant, Levy said to him, [...] "Did you really take her life? Look me in <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> tell me." [...] Fisher denied Guandique's motion for retrial and handed down a sentence of 60 years in prison, stating that Guandique [...] "will be a danger for some time. He's a sexual predator." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Janovitz of Allmusic {{describes}} the music as beautiful, with folk guitar chord changes and a somber melody, while the chorus, with its line [...] "and it's all over now, Baby Blue" [...] has a heartbreaking quality to it. Like other Dylan {{songs of the}} period, such as [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the lyrics of [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] bear the strong influence of Symbolist poets such as Arthur Rimbaud. Lines such as [...] "take what you have gathered from coincidence" [...] reflect the I Ching philosophy that coincidence represents more than mere chance. The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, with not a snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song around in my head {{for a long time}} and I remember that when I was writing it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song. It had always been one of my favorites, Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she said how do you do/she looked into <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> said/my name is Baby Blue.' [...] It was one of the songs I used to sing back in high school. Of course, I was singing about a different Baby Blue." ...|$|E
500|$|Bob Boilen of NPR wrote, [...] "I simply couldn't believe <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> ears. Seeing Jackie Evancho {{sing for}} the first time is nearly beyond belief." [...] He called her voice [...] "beyond-beautiful" [...] when she {{performed}} [...] "for a stunned audience at the NPR Music offices. She clearly is a very happy girl with an amazing musical gift." [...] A review of her 2011 Sun Valley concert stated that [...] "Evancho transported [...] with pure, joyous, unaffected notes". Marcia Adair of the Los Angeles Times commented in reviewing Dream With Me that [...] "her voice has matured quite a lot over the past 10 months. ... hat makes us feel like she will survive the journey from child star to adult performer is her magnificent sense of pitch, her natural ability to shape phrases and the ease with which she performs." [...] Jon Caramanica, in The New York Times, reviewed her Avery Fisher Hall concert: [...] "In {{the first half of the}} show Ms. Evancho often receded, but toward the end of the night she found purpose, delivering 'A Time for Us' with punch, and closing out Sarah McLachlan’s 'Angel' with what felt like real yearning". The Wall Street Journal called Evancho's 2011 performance of the song [...] "Angel" [...] on the Tonight Show [...] "moving".|$|E

500|$|Rindt's hesitancy {{appeared}} justified {{when both}} he and Hill suffered high speed crashes at the Spanish Grand Prix at Montjuïc. In both instances, the suspension mounted wings on the cars broke off, causing accidents that could have killed either driver. The effect of the failure lifted Rindt's car off the track and into the barriers, where it collided with the stationary car of Hill, whose accident occurred at the same spot. Although Rindt only suffered a broken nose, one marshal lost an eye and another had his foot broken. Rindt was furious with Lotus's team owner, Colin Chapman, over the failure; he told a reporter after the accident: [...] "I place the blame on him [...] and rightfully so, because he should have calculated that the wing would break." [...] In an interview on Austrian television a day later, he said: [...] "These wings are insanity [...] in <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{should not be allowed}} on racing cars. [...] But to get any wisdom into Colin Chapman's head is impossible." [...] Asked whether he had lost trust in Lotus after the accident, he replied: [...] "I never had any trust in Lotus", going on to describe his relationship with the team as [...] "purely business". His accident left him sidelined for the Monaco Grand Prix, a race that Hill won.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to Necrid varied. University of Delaware professor Rachel Hutchinson cited {{him as an}} example of the cultural stereotype of human versus monster, a [...] "mutated or damned [...] deviant from the human norm" [...] that the game's human characters are expected to vanquish. A staff writer for GameNOW magazine called the visual design [...] "silly" [...] and compared the character to an [...] "old-school He-Man character", but added that Necrid's gameplay was decent. Another magazine, GMR, described him {{as an example of}} [...] "bad American comic book design". IGN's Kaiser Hwang called Necrid a [...] "disappointment" [...] and questioned the character's design in comparison to others in the series; he also felt Necrid was [...] "filler" [...] rather than a complete character. GameSpot made similar comments in their review of the game, as did GameSpy. IGN's Xbox article editor described the character's inclusion as an unnecessary marketing ploy and would have preferred new characters made without McFarlane's involvement; the editor also wrote that Necrid did not [...] "vibe" [...] with the rest of the game. 1UP.com's podcast Retronauts criticized the design and wrote that the character's name was used as a synonym for [...] "shitty". They further added that McFarlane had [...] "tainted" [...] the game with Necrid's inclusion, with host Jeremy Parish stating [...] "I could close <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> draw a better character". In a retrospective of the series, Joystiq used him {{as an example of the}} series succumbing to [...] "commercial gimmicks", citing his design as reviled and that Necrid was either too strong or too weak a character to play as, depending on who one asked.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the park}} and Twitter posts {{selected}} by news media, public response during the soft opening was positive; Total Orlando gave the ride five stars for teenagers and four stars for adults. On Coaster101.com [...] "Ashley" [...] said that although the restraints were tight, they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides, adding: [...] "The drop on Falcon's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden. The best way I can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach {{at the top of the}} tower, you take it with you to the bottom." [...] According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition {{to the park}}'s attraction lineup: [...] "Falcon's Fury is not for the faint of heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous." [...] Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance; as a result, [...] "You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually limiting the audience for that." [...] Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again. Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said, [...] "it was terrifying and thrilling and I held on as hard as I could and yelled and closed <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated." ...|$|E
