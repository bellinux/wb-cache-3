5|$|Charles Albert Tindley, born in 1851 in Berlin, Maryland, {{would become}} the first major {{composer}} of gospel music, a style that drew on African American spirituals, Christian hymns and other folk music traditions. Tindley's earliest <b>musical</b> <b>experience</b> likely included tarrying services, a musical tradition of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, wherein Christian worshipers prayed and sang throughout the night. He became an itinerant preacher as an adult, working at churches throughout Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, then settled down as a pastor in Philadelphia, eventually opening a large church called Tindley Temple United Methodist Church.|$|E

25|$|Born in Fontmell Magna, Dorset, Gardiner's early <b>musical</b> <b>experience</b> came {{largely through}} singing {{with his family}} and in a local church choir.

He was educated at Bryanston School, then studied history, Arabic, and medieval Spanish at King's College, Cambridge.|$|E

40|$|Abstract = A digital musical instrument, he "Musical Playpen", was {{developed}} {{in an effort to}} provide children with immersive <b>musical</b> <b>experiences.</b> The instrument senses children's motion inside a playpen filled with plastic balls and maps their gestures to musical output. This allows the players to use familiar and fun play activities while exploring the musical consequences of their actions. Observations of children's play patterns in the instrument suggest that immersive <b>musical</b> <b>experiences</b> can introduce infants and toddlers to a variety of creative and expressive <b>musical</b> <b>experiences,</b> rarely offered by traditional musical instruments...|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} part of Mullins' early <b>musical</b> <b>experience</b> was being the pianist, songwriter and vocalist for the New Creations Choir in Richmond, Indiana, which was started by Tim and Bonnie Cummings in the early 1970s. The choir toured numerous states in its own bus and even produced an album. New Creations is a church and school for teens, and Mullins was a contributing factor in its beginning.|$|E
25|$|The Nordoff-Robbins approach, {{based on}} the belief that {{everyone}} is capable of finding meaning in and benefitting from <b>musical</b> <b>experience,</b> is now practiced by hundreds of therapists internationally.

Various techniques are used to accommodate all capabilities so that even the most low functioning individuals are able to participate actively.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 13, Glinka went to the capital, Saint Petersburg, {{to study}} at a school for {{children}} of the nobility. Here he learned Latin, English, and Persian, studied mathematics and zoology, and considerably widened his <b>musical</b> <b>experience.</b> He had three piano lessons from John Field, the Irish composer of nocturnes, who {{spent some time in}} Saint Petersburg. He then continued his piano lessons with Charles Mayer and began composing.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps because Balakirev's initial <b>musical</b> <b>experience</b> {{was as a}} pianist, composers for his own {{instrument}} {{influenced the}} repertory and style of his compositions. He wrote in all the genres cultivated by Frédéric Chopin except the Ballade, cultivating a comparable charm. The other keyboard composer who influenced Balakirev was Franz Liszt, apparent in Islamey {{as well as in}} his transcriptions of works by other composers and the symphonic poem Tamara.|$|E
25|$|As a {{cognitive}} neuroscientist specializing in music perception and cognition, he is credited for fundamentally {{changing the way}} that scientists think about auditory memory, showing through the Levitin Effect, that long-term memory preserves many {{of the details of}} <b>musical</b> <b>experience</b> that previous theorists regarded as lost during the encoding process. He is also known for drawing attention to the role of cerebellum in music listening, including tracking the beat and distinguishing familiar from unfamiliar music.|$|E

25|$|Music Together is {{an internationally}} {{recognized}} early childhood music program for infants, toddlers, {{and young children}} through age 7 and their families. Its curriculum encourages children’s natural enthusiasm for music and movement. The program requires no prior <b>musical</b> <b>experience</b> {{on the part of}} the family. Music Together is currently a tuition-based program and has recently expanded to include both weekday and weekend classes at locations throughout San Antonio. Its class expansion includes a tuition-subsidy for participants from economically challenged communities.|$|E
25|$|The latter 19th century saw the {{development}} of modern music psychology alongside {{the emergence of a}} general empirical psychology, one which passed through similar stages of development. The first was structuralist psychology, led by Wilhelm Wundt, which sought to break down experience into its smallest definable parts. This expanded upon previous centuries of acoustic study, and included Helmholtz developing the resonator to isolate and understand pure and complex tones and their perception, the philosopher Carl Stumpf using church organs and his own <b>musical</b> <b>experience</b> to explore timbre and absolute pitch, and Wundt himself associating the experience of rhythm with kinesthetic tension and relaxation.|$|E
25|$|In Waldorf education, pentatonic {{music is}} {{considered}} to be appropriate for young children due to its simplicity and unselfconscious openness of expression. Pentatonic music centered around intervals of the fifth is often sung and played in early childhood; progressively smaller intervals are emphasized within primarily pentatonic as children progress through the early school years. At around nine years of age the music begins to center around first folk music using a six-tone scale, and then the modern diatonic scales, with the goal of reflecting the children's developmental progress in their <b>musical</b> <b>experience.</b> Pentatonic instruments used include lyres, pentatonic flutes, and tone bars; special instruments have been designed and built for the Waldorf curriculum.|$|E

25|$|An expert jury {{chose the}} three best songs {{to compete at}} the 2009 Andorran Eurovision {{national}} final. Interested singers were told to send demos with a maximum of three songs, {{with at least one}} song sung in Catalan. In addition, composers were told to send in at least one song to the station. All composers and singers must be over 18, preferably with Andorran citizenship and nationality. Catalan lyrics are preferred by RTVA. The singers' <b>musical</b> <b>experience</b> and fluency in Catalan, as well as their fluency in speaking English and French, will also be taken into account. At the national final, the Andorran entrant will be chosen entirely through the use of SMS texting by the public.|$|E
25|$|A Carnatic {{composition}} {{really has}} two elements, one being the musical element, the other being what is conveyed in the composition. It is {{probably because of}} this fact that most Carnatic music compositions are composed for singing. In addition to the rich <b>musical</b> <b>experience,</b> each composition brings out the knowledge and personality of the composer, and hence the words {{are as important as}} the musical element itself. This poses a special challenge for the musicians because rendering this music does not involve just playing or singing the correct musical notes; the musicians are expected to understand what was conveyed by the composer in various languages, and sing musical phrases that act to create the effect that was intended by the composer in his/her composition.|$|E
25|$|Schneider et al. {{also studied}} {{the effects of}} {{combining}} music therapy with standard motor rehabilitation methods. In this experiment, researchers recruited stroke patients without prior <b>musical</b> <b>experience</b> and trained half of them in an intensive step by step training program that occurred fifteen times over three weeks, in addition to traditional treatment. These participants were trained to use both fine and gross motor movements by learning {{how to use the}} piano and drums. The other half of the patients received only traditional treatment {{over the course of the}} three weeks. Three-dimensional movement analysis and clinical motor tests showed participants who received the additional music therapy had significantly better speed, precision, and smoothness of movement as compared to the control subjects. Participants who received music therapy also showed a significant improvement in every-day motor activities as compared to the control group. Wilson, Parsons, & Reutens looked at the effect of melodic intonation therapy (MIT) on speech production in a male singer with severe Broca's aphasia. In this study, thirty novel phrases were taught in three conditions: unrehearsed, rehearsed verbal production (repetition), or rehearsed verbal production with melody (MIT). Results showed that phrases taught in the MIT condition had superior production, and that compared to rehearsal, effects of MIT lasted longer.|$|E
