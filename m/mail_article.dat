25|$|Irish {{business}} consortium Larionovo {{had plans}} to develop the Ireland island into an Irish-themed resort. The plans include a large internal marina, apartments and villas, a gym, hotel, and an Irish-themed pub. In July 2007 {{it was announced that}} the Ireland Island would feature a recreation of Northern Ireland's Giant's Causeway. However, on 25 November 2008 a provisional liquidator was appointed to Larionovo. The islands of Great Britain and Moscow on The World were acquired by Premier Real Estate Bureau in the Summer of 2008. News was leaked in a Daily <b>Mail</b> <b>article</b> of January 2009, refuting claims that Great Britain was owned by Richard Branson, Rod Stewart or John O'Dolan.|$|E

500|$|According to Richard Guilliatt and Jacquelin Magnay in {{an article}} in The Australian, Harris' {{campaign}} against paedophilia in Kids Can Say No! can [...] "be seen in retrospect as either monumental self-delusion or a sign of deep, self-lacerating guilt". NSPCC chief executive officer Peter Wanless appeared on Good Morning Britain saying that Harris' appearance in the film was hypocritical. In an Irish Daily <b>Mail</b> <b>article,</b> Paul Bracchi writes that Harris' work on Kids Can Say No! {{at the same time that}} he was abusing girls was [...] "one of the most sickening examples [...] hiding in plain sight". In 2014, theme composer Peter Alsop said that Harris may have used the film to groom children because it encouraged trust by parents.|$|E
500|$|Two more {{issues are}} {{addressed}} in the Sunday Herald article, {{but not in the}} Daily <b>Mail</b> <b>article.</b> The first is of the knots used to tie up Carol's body [...] the knots on Carol's body were mostly granny knots, of which {{there was no evidence that}} Gordon ever used [...] indeed during the trial he was specifically asked this, and he responded, [...] "I do not use granny knots". The granny knot is always a mistake, used by someone who should have used a reef knot; those learning knot-tying frequently make this mistake. Gordon Park, an experienced knot-tyer, would likely never use a granny knot, and their frequent appearance on the body of Carol is strong evidence that it was not Gordon who tied them. The article also claims that the evidence of knots was irrelevant anyway, as climbers and yachtsmen were so common in the area. The other piece of evidence related to another rock taken from the lakebed, which had supposedly come from the Parks' roof. However, the prosecution eventually admitted that Westmoreland green slate had been worked in the area for hundreds of years, and could have come from anywhere. The Herald also mentions the fact that the police files from the original missing persons inquiry into Carol Park had gone missing themselves, but does not draw any conclusions from this.|$|E
500|$|Scotland voted by a 10% margin against independence, but the {{referendum}} returned [...] "Yes" [...] votes in some traditional Labour strongholds, particularly Glasgow and North Lanarkshire, prompting media speculation about Lamont's future as the party's leader. Shortly after {{the referendum}}, a Daily <b>Mail</b> <b>article</b> claimed that Shadow International Development Secretary Jim Murphy was being {{lined up to}} take over from her, while The Herald reported that party delegates concerned about the results had started to view Murphy as a possible successor. Lamont had attempted to quash rumours of a leadership challenge at the 25 September 2014 session of First Minister's Questions, {{the first of the}} post-referendum era. [...] "When the First Minister is long gone I will still be doing my job on behalf of the people of Scotland." [...] Her position remained uncertain. Alan Cochrane wrote that many Labour MPs in Scotland feared losing their seats at the 2015 general election without a change of leadership. In October, two former first ministers voiced their concern about the direction of the party. McConnell expressed fears that Labour would experience increased difficulty in regaining the confidence of Scottish voters following the election of Sturgeon as SNP leader, and described the party as [...] "a political machine that is angry about what has happened in Scotland in the recent past". Shortly afterwards, his predecessor, Henry McLeish suggested Labour had ceded [...] "enormous ground to the SNP unnecessarily" [...] because its supporters no longer understood [...] "what the party stands for". Margaret Curran, the Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, said that although the party was changing, it needed to reconnect with its [...] "socialist principles".|$|E

500|$|Although Scotland {{had voted}} to remain {{part of the}} UK, the {{independence}} referendum had returned [...] "Yes" [...] votes in some traditional Labour strongholds, particularly Glasgow and North Lanarkshire, prompting media speculation about Lamont's future as the party's leader.

[...] Her position remained uncertain. The Daily Telegraphs Alan Cochrane wrote that many Labour MPs in Scotland feared losing their seats in the 2015 UK general election without a change of leadership. In the weeks following the referendum, SNP membership increased fourfold, reaching more than 100,000 by mid-December. Labour's membership over the same period was less clear. Paul Hutcheon noted in the 9 November edition of the Sunday Herald that Labour had [...] "consistently declined" [...] to confirm the number of its members in Scotland, but quoted an [...] "informed source" [...] suggesting the figure was slightly short of 13,500. However, Peter Jones of The Scotsman subsequently quoted a less favourable figure of fewer than 10,000, with [...] "most of the existing constituency membership [...] the relatives and friends of councillors/MSPs/MPs [...] would not welcome ... an influx of new members who might try to oust second-rate post-holders in favour of somebody new and better".|$|E
2500|$|Another person {{accused of}} {{genocide}} revisionism is the Montreal writer Robin Philpot, whom Gerald Caplan identified in a 2007 Globe and <b>Mail</b> <b>article</b> as believing that [...] "many {{people were killed}} in 1994 by both sides making those who carried out the genocide and their enemies morally equivalent."

2500|$|Either way, {{the fact}} that many farmers are prosecuted by the Environment Agency for {{pollution}} or waste offences as they struggle to adhere to constantly tightening regulation, demonstrates that environmental legislation is crucial to the protection of the land where any such development is placed. [...] Following the withdrawal and refusal of Nocton Dairies' plans, one of the directors, Peter Willes, had to pay over £23,000 when he accepted responsibility for three environmental offences, two of which related to pollution of water courses. [...] Mr Willes' previous environmental offences were also outlined in a widely criticised Daily <b>Mail</b> <b>article</b> on mega dairies, which drew unrepresentative comparisons against US practices long banned in the UK and Europe.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} unsuccessful attempts in the 60 years since its discovery to crack the letters found {{at the rear of}} the book, including efforts by military and naval intelligence, mathematicians, and amateur code crackers. In 2004, retired detective Gerry Feltus suggested in a Sunday <b>Mail</b> <b>article</b> that the final line [...] "ITTMTSAMSTGAB" [...] could stand for the initials of [...] "It's Time To Move To South Australia Moseley Street..." [...] (the former nurse lived in Moseley Street which is the main road through Glenelg). A 2014 analysis by computational linguist John Rehling strongly supports the theory that the letters consist of the initials of some English text, but finds no match for these in a large survey of literature, and concludes that the letters were likely written as a form of shorthand, not as a code, and that the original text can likely never be determined.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 July 2004, Paul Martin {{appointed}} Dion the Minister of the Environment.

Dion championed a [...] "new industrial revolution" [...] focused on [...] "environmentally sustainable technologies and products", and he sought to nurture a collaborative relationship with big business rather than a confrontational one. His maiden speech before the Calgary Chamber of Commerce illustrates just how accommodating {{he was ready to}} be: [...] "Calgary is one of Canada's most impressive economic engines.... Alberta could soon be the second-largest oil-exporting jurisdiction on Earth, behind Saudi Arabia. This is tremendous blessing for Canada." [...] In October 2005, Dion nominated oil and gas executive Allan Amey to head up the government's $1-billion Clean Fund, the largest single element in Dion's Kyoto implementation strategy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{newspaper}} {{also turned}} against Cherie Blair, the former Prime Minister's wife, when the Blairs' lawyers prevented {{the publication of}} a former nanny's memoirs; official regulations prevent press revelations regarding the children of public figures. The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday also came into direct conflict with No. 10 in 2002 for their pursuit of Cherie Blair's connection to the conman Peter Foster, although Dacre denied any [...] "agenda apart from good journalism". He was reportedly horrified when he saw Cherie Blair breastfeeding in public. Tony Blair targeted the Mail titles directly, denouncing [...] "parts of the media that will take what there is that is true and then turn it round into something that is a total distortion of the real truth". Motivated by the Daily Express disallowing the Daily Mail to serialise a biography of Alastair Campbell by then Express employee Peter Oborne, the Mails spoiling exercise led to Campbell contacting Dacre because a <b>Mail</b> <b>article</b> had falsely declared Campbell's father to be dead when, in fact, he was still alive.
