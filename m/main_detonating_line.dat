50|$|The {{oldest and}} {{simplest}} type of cap, fuse caps are a metal cylinder, closed at one end. From the open end inwards, there is first an empty space into which a pyrotechnic fuse is inserted and crimped, then a pyrotechnic ignition mix, a primary explosive, {{and then the}} <b>main</b> <b>detonating</b> explosive charge.|$|R
5000|$|Approximately a half-second later, the <b>main</b> charge <b>detonated</b> at {{the optimum}} height {{to kill or}} {{severely}} injure anyone in the immediate area.|$|R
40|$|Underwater shocks and bubbles were {{generated}} using a high energy pulsed laser system. The advantages of this experimental approach are: (1) precisely controlled and measured experimental conditions; (2) improved diagnostics, including extensive imaging capabilities; (3) unique experiments, including a simultaneously <b>detonated</b> <b>line</b> charge; and (4) {{the ability to}} provide validation quality data for hydrodynamic simulation codes. Bubble sensitivity to variation of several experimental parameters was examined. Numerical simulations were performed corresponding to the experimental shots, showing that empirical bubble theory, experimental bubble data, and simulations were all in good agreement...|$|R
50|$|A {{bounding}} mine is an anti-personnel mine {{designed to be}} used in open areas. When tripped, a small propelling charge launches the body of the mine 3-4 feet (0.9-1.2 metres) into the air, where the <b>main</b> charge <b>detonates</b> and sprays fragmentation at roughly waist height.|$|R
50|$|Explosive {{material}} may {{be incorporated}} in the explosive train of a device or system. An example is a pyrotechnic lead igniting a booster, which causes the <b>main</b> charge to <b>detonate.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{relatively}} recent example of airburst munitions is the VOG-25P [...] "jumping" [...] 40 mm caseless grenade, which contains a secondary charge to launch {{it up to}} 1.5 meters above its point of impact before the <b>main</b> charge <b>detonates.</b> Another recent development is computer programmable rounds. Weapons using this new technology include the XM29, XM25, XM307, K11, and PAPOP, {{all of which are}} in various stages of prototyping or testing.|$|R
40|$|Syndrome of frailty in the elderly, {{involves}} presenting adverse events, {{most in need}} of care, {{increased risk}} of progression to disability, dependency and death. The objective of the research was to determine the number of older adults presenting fragility syndrome and the most determining factor in a rural population of the State of Puebla, Mexico. A descriptive, observational, cross-sectional, prospective study was conducted. The sample was composed of 200 patients over 65 years of age, registered in the study community health center. Data was collected through the application of the geriatric scale and fragility of Cuban criteria were applied. Including older adults 52. 5 % were female and 47. 5 male. The prevalence of fragility Syndrome was 45 %, being higher in women. As associated factor found alterations in mobility and balance with a 26. 5 %. It is concluded that there is a high prevalence of fragile seniors in a rural community in Puebla, Mexico; alterations in mobility and balance are the <b>main</b> <b>detonating</b> factor, due to activities of daily living that predominate in Latin American rural areas...|$|R
50|$|When {{a person}} steps on a blast mine and {{activates}} it, the mine's <b>main</b> charge <b>detonates,</b> creating a blast shock wave consisting of hot gases travelling at extremely high velocity. The shock wave sends a huge compressive force upwards, ejecting the mine casing and any soil covering the mine along with it. When the blast wave hits the surface, it quickly transfers the force into the subject's footwear and foot. This {{results in a}} massive compression force being applied. In most cases, the victim's foot is blown off by the blast wave.|$|R
5000|$|An {{initiator}} {{such as a}} shock tube, cannon fuse, or even {{a conventional}} detonator does not deliver sufficient shock to detonate charges comprising TNT, Composition B, ANFO and many other high explosives. Therefore, some form of [...] "booster" [...] is required to amplify the energy released by the detonator so that the <b>main</b> charge will <b>detonate.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{a skilled}} chemist, Łukaszewicz {{was chosen as}} the person to build three bombs that were to kill the tsar. To make it easier to hide the bomb, he {{concealed}} it in a copy of Grunberg's Medical Dictionary. The inside was filled with shrapnel and dynamite, while the fuse was made of a tube filled with mercury fulminate. Two additional bombs were prepared in case the <b>main</b> did not <b>detonate</b> as planned. To make the explosion more lethal, Łukaszewicz decided to fill all three bombs with capsules filled with strychnine.|$|R
50|$|The bombings {{were in the}} Kfar Sousa neighbourhood, {{south-west}} of Damascus city center. The state-owned news channel, al-Ikhbariya al-Suriya, {{said the}} first car bomb exploded outside the offices of an unspecified security agency. When guards at a nearby General Security Directorate compound went to inspect the first blast, the driver of another vehicle rammed the <b>main</b> gates and <b>detonated</b> the bomb it was carrying. According to a Syrian journalist who lives in Kfar Sousa, gunfire was heard immediately following the blasts and windows up to 200 m (670 ft) away were shattered.|$|R
30|$|The WV ranks {{second in}} the nation for {{explosives}} consumption (Apodaca 2010). Almost 350, 000 tonnes were used in WV surface coal mining in 2009. Considering an average price of blasting agents (bulk emulsions, slurry and ANFO) of $ 1.14 per kg, the surface coal mines in WV spent almost $ 400 million for explosives alone. This does not include additional blasting accessories such as detonators, boosters, <b>detonating</b> cords, lead <b>lines,</b> additional costs for labor, explosives truck-delivery, and shot services. The addition of the drilling, digging and loading costs for the blasted material amounts to a significant overall cost to mine operators.|$|R
50|$|An {{officer in}} the Red Army's {{military}} intelligence {{at the time of}} the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Banov organized several partisan groups behind the German lines that grew to become sizeable formations during the Nazi occupation.Ivan Banov's partisan fighters carried out significant raids on the occupying German forces and facilitated the Red Army's liberation of the German-occupied territory of the Soviet Union in 1942-1944. Credited with disrupting the enemy supply <b>lines,</b> <b>detonating</b> twenty railroad bridges, and accumulating valuable intelligence material, Banov was recognized with the honorary title of Hero of the Soviet Union in 1944.|$|R
5000|$|Mines in the Battle of Messines: On 7 June 1917, {{a series}} of large British mines, {{containing}} a total of over 455 tons of ammonal explosive, was <b>detonated</b> beneath German <b>lines</b> on the Messines-Wytschaete ridge. The explosions created 19 large craters, killed about 10,000 German soldiers, and were heard {{as far away as}} London and Dublin. While determining the power of explosions is difficult, this was probably the largest planned explosion in history until the 1945 Trinity atomic weapon test, and the largest non-nuclear planned explosion until the 1947 British Heligoland detonation (below). The Messines mines detonation killed more people than any other non-nuclear man-made explosion in history.|$|R
5000|$|The M21 is a {{circular}} U.S. anti-tank landmine {{that uses a}} Misznay Schardin effect warhead. The mine uses an M607 pressure fuse, which can be adapted as a tilt rod fuze. The mine is triggered either by pressure, or by the tilt rod being forced beyond 20 degrees from the vertical by a force of more than 1.7 kg, either of these actions results in pressure being transferred via a bearing cap to a Belleville spring, which inverts, driving the firing pin into the M46 detonator. The M46 charge first ignites a black powder charge, which blows off the mine's cover, and clears any earth or debris {{that may have been}} on top of the mine. A fraction of a second later the <b>main</b> warhead <b>detonates,</b> driving and compressing a steel plate upwards, with enough force to penetrate 76 mm of armour at a distance of 530 mm. Approximately 200,000 M21 mines were produced in the U.S. and a licensed copies, the K441 and K442, were produced in South Korea.|$|R
5000|$|In Thessaloniki {{he joined}} the anarchist brotherhood, called the Gemidzii and becames part of it. As such he participated in assassinations Salonika in 1903. On April 15, 1903 Dimitar Mechev, Ilija Trachkov and Milan Arsov <b>detonated</b> the railway <b>line</b> Thessaloniki - Istanbul, the blast damaged several cars and the locomotive, but the {{passengers}} ware not hurt. The next day Arsov threw a bomb {{in front of the}} hotel [...] "Alhambra".Arsov was one of four survivors from the Gemidzhii, who were put on trial from a military court. Along with Pavel Shatev, Georgi Bogdanov and Marko Boshnakov they were sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he along with other assassins had been sent to Fezzan in Sahara.|$|R
50|$|It was {{designed}} in 1988 by the Soviet Union weapons company Bazalt {{and based on}} the RPG-7 but modified to penetrate explosive reactive armour. The small precursor charge {{at the tip of the}} rocket is designed to hit the reactive armour before the <b>main</b> charge and <b>detonate</b> it. The reactive armour plate should deploy, exploding and disrupting the precursor charge's HEAT jet. As reactive armor is usually single usage only, this renders that particular block of reactive armor useless and unable to protect against the much larger and more powerful main shaped charge. The main shaped charge is a full calibre warhead (filled with 1.43 kg OKFOL), explodes and is supposed to penetrate the target through the weak spot created by the precursor charge.|$|R
50|$|The mine can be laid {{either by}} hand or by a {{mechanical}} mine laying system. Once the mine is emplaced, a pre-set arming delay {{of up to}} 60 minutes is initiated, after which the magnetic sensor activates and will trigger the mine if a target passes overhead. When the mine is triggered, a small clearing charge blows away any material {{that may have been}} on top of the mine, followed {{a fraction of a second}} later by detonation of the <b>main</b> explosive charge <b>detonates.</b> The <b>main</b> charge creates an explosively formed penetrator which is capable of penetrating the belly armour of any tank currently in existence, and generates substantial secondary blast and fragmentation effects. The mine is blast resistant and has been upgraded to be resistant to advanced demining mine countermeasures.|$|R
50|$|Another notable {{example of}} {{military}} mining was the Battle of Messines in 1917, when {{a series of}} mines was <b>detonated</b> beneath German <b>lines</b> after about two years of sapping. The near simultaneous explosion of the Messines mines with a combined amount of 450 tonnes of high explosive created 19 large craters and ranks among the largest non-nuclear explosions of all time. Approximately 10,000 German troops were killed. Not all of the mines laid by the British Army at Messines were detonated, however. Two mines were not ignited in 1917 {{because they had been}} abandoned before the battle, and four were outside the area of the offensive. On 17 July 1955, a lightning strike set off one of these four latter mines. There were no human casualties, but one cow was killed. Another of the unused mines {{is believed to have been}} found in a location beneath a farmhouse, but no attempt has been made to remove it. The last mine fired by the British in World War I was near Givenchy on 10 August 1917, after which the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers concentrated on constructing deep dugouts for troop accommodation.|$|R
