5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of <b>Morphogenesis,</b> an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called <b>morphogenesis.</b> He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.|$|E
5|$|Cutaneous {{congenital}} anomalies are {{a diverse}} group of disorders that result from faulty <b>morphogenesis,</b> the biological process that forms the shape of a human body.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{is remembered}} {{as the author of}} the 1917 book On Growth and Form, which led the way for the {{scientific}} explanation of <b>morphogenesis,</b> the process by which patterns and body structures are formed in plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the genes}} {{responsible}} for the regulation of inner ear formation and its <b>morphogenesis</b> {{are members of the}} homeobox gene family such as Pax, Msx and Otx homeobox genes. The development of inner ear structures such as the cochlea is regulated by Dlx5/Dlx6, Otx1/Otx2 and Pax2, which in turn are controlled by the master gene Shh. Shh is secreted by the notochord.|$|E
5|$|The {{unity of}} much of the <b>morphogenesis</b> of organisms from fertilized egg to adult began to be unraveled after the {{discovery}} of the homeobox genes, first in fruit flies, then in other insects and animals, including humans. These developments led to advances in the field of evolutionary developmental biology towards understanding how the various body plans of the animal phyla have evolved and how they are related to one another.|$|E
5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of cellular differentiation. During <b>morphogenesis,</b> totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, {{gives rise to the}} many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, Belgian {{physicist}} Joseph Plateau examined soap films, {{leading him}} to formulate {{the concept of}} a minimal surface. German biologist and artist Ernst Haeckel painted hundreds of marine organisms to emphasise their symmetry. Scottish biologist D'Arcy Thompson pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations could explain spiral growth. In the 20th century, British mathematician Alan Turing predicted mechanisms of <b>morphogenesis</b> which give rise to patterns of spots and stripes. Hungarian biologist Aristid Lindenmayer and French American mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot showed how the mathematics of fractals could create plant growth patterns.|$|E
5|$|Recent work in {{developmental}} biology has identified dynamical and physical mechanisms of tissue <b>morphogenesis</b> that may underlie abrupt morphological transitions during evolution. Consequently, consideration of mechanisms of phylogenetic change {{that have been}} found in reality to be non-gradual is increasingly common in the field of evolutionary developmental biology, particularly in studies of the origin of morphological novelty. A description of such mechanisms {{can be found in the}} multi-authored volume Origination of Organismal Form (MIT Press; 2003).|$|E
5|$|The {{mathematical}} biologist Stuart Kauffman {{has suggested}} that self-organization may play roles alongside natural selection in three areas of evolutionary biology, namely population dynamics, molecular evolution, and <b>morphogenesis.</b> However, Kauffman {{does not take into}} account the essential role of energy (for example, using pyrophosphate) in driving biochemical reactions in cells, as proposed by Christian DeDuve and modelled mathematically by Richard Bagley and Walter Fontana. Their systems are self-catalyzing but not simply self-organizing as they are thermodynamically open systems relying on a continuous input of energy.|$|E
5|$|The {{respiratory}} tract has a branching structure {{like that of}} a tree. In the embryo this structure is developed in the process of branching <b>morphogenesis,</b> and is generated by the repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. In the development of the lungs (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms branching tubes.The lung has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a bronchial bud grows out as a tubular epithelium that becomes a bronchus. Each bronchus branches into bronchioles. The branching {{is a result of the}} tip of each tube bifurcating. The branching process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately the alveoli. The four genes mostly associated with branching <b>morphogenesis</b> in the lung are the intercellular signalling protein – sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein BMP4. FGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. FGF10 is a paracrine signalling molecule needed for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10. The development of the alveoli is influenced by a different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the alveoli.|$|E
5|$|While the {{development}} of wings in insects is clearly defined in those {{who are members of}} Endopterygota, which undergo complete metamorphosis; in these species, the wing develops while in the pupal stage of the insects life cycle. However, insects that undergo incomplete metamorphosis do not have a pupal stage, therefore they must have a different wing <b>morphogenesis.</b> Insects such as those that are hemimetabolic have wings that start out as buds, which are found underneath the exoskeleton, and do not become exposed until the last instar of the nymph.|$|E
25|$|Transcription {{factors and}} {{transcriptional}} regulatory networks play key roles in plant <b>morphogenesis</b> and their evolution. During plant landing, many novel transcription factor families emerged and are preferentially wired into the networks of multicellular development, reproduction, and organ development, contributing to more complex <b>morphogenesis</b> of land plants.|$|E

25|$|All stages (bud, cap, bell, crown), {{growth and}} <b>morphogenesis</b> of the teeth are {{regulated}} by a protein called sonic hedgehog.|$|E
25|$|This {{represent}} a fundamental factor of the morphological {{evolution of a}} slope. Bedding attitude {{and the presence of}} discontinuities or faults control the slope <b>morphogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Apart from VDR activation, various {{alternative}} {{mechanisms of}} action are under study, such as inhibition of signal transduction by hedgehog, a hormone involved in <b>morphogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Notch {{signaling}} pathway is {{a critical component of}} cardiovascular formation and <b>morphogenesis</b> in both development and disease. It is required for the selection of endothelial tip and stalk cells during sprouting angiogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Potter {{sequence}} is the atypical physical {{appearance of a}} baby due to oligohydramnios experienced when in the uterus. Oligohydramnios is the decrease in amniotic fluid volume sufficient to cause deformations in <b>morphogenesis</b> of the fetus.|$|E
25|$|The gene network (transcriptional {{and protein}} interactions) {{governing}} the early {{development of the}} fruit fly embryo {{is one of the}} best understood gene networks to date, especially the patterning along the anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) axes (See under <b>morphogenesis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Self-organization {{in biology}} can be {{observed}} in spontaneous folding of proteins and other biomacromolecules, formation of lipid bilayer membranes, pattern formation and <b>morphogenesis</b> in developmental biology, the coordination of human movement, social behaviour in insects (bees, ants, termites), and mammals, flocking behaviour in birds and fish.|$|E
25|$|Transcription {{factors and}} {{transcriptional}} regulatory networks play key roles in plant development and stress responses, {{as well as}} their evolution. During plant landing, many novel transcription factor families emerged and are preferentially wired into the networks of multicellular development, reproduction, and organ development, contributing to more complex <b>morphogenesis</b> of land plants.|$|E
25|$|During embryo {{development}} in mice, Cyr61 is highly {{expressed in the}} cardiovascular, skeletal, and neuronal systems. Cyr61 knockout mice are embryonic lethal due to defects in cardiac septal <b>morphogenesis,</b> deficient blood vessel formation in placenta, and compromised vascular integrity. In Xenopus laevis, Cyr61 is required for normal gastrulation and modulation of Wnt signaling.|$|E
25|$|In {{the hair}} follicle, stemcells reside in a {{discrete}} microenvironment called the bulge, {{located at the}} base of the part of the follicle that is established during <b>morphogenesis</b> but does not degenerate during the hair cycle. The bulge contains multipotent stemcells that can be recruited during wound healing to help the repair of the epidermis.|$|E
25|$|A gene (or genetic) {{regulatory}} network (GRN) is {{a collection}} of molecular regulators that interact {{with each other and with}} other substances in the cell to govern the gene expression levels of mRNA and proteins. These play a central role in <b>morphogenesis,</b> the creation of body structures, which in turn is central to evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo).|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the high}} number of MAPK genes, MAPK {{pathways}} of higher plants were studied less than animal or fungal ones. Although their signaling appears very complex, the MPK3, MPK4 and MPK6 kinases of Arabidopsis thaliana are key mediators of responses to osmotic shock, oxidative stress, response to cold and involved in anti-pathogen responses. In addition, they are also involved in <b>morphogenesis,</b> since MPK4 mutants display severe dwarfism.|$|E
25|$|In newt {{and general}} {{amphibian}} embryos, cell division {{is not a}} driving role in <b>morphogenesis.</b> Newt embryo cells are much larger and exhibit egg pigmentation to distinguish cells from each other. The newt neural plate doubles in length, decreases in apical width, and increases in thickness. The plate edges rise dorsally and fold toward the midline to form the neural tube. The apical surface area decreases.|$|E
25|$|Actin’s {{cytoskeleton}} {{is key to}} {{the processes}} of endocytosis, cytokinesis, determination of cell polarity and <b>morphogenesis</b> in yeasts. In addition to relying on actin these processes involve 20 or 30 associated proteins, which all have a high degree of evolutionary conservation, along with many signalling molecules. Together these elements allow a spatially and temporally modulated assembly that defines a cell’s response to both internal and external stimuli.|$|E
25|$|The p7 {{protein is}} {{dispensable}} for viral genome replication but plays {{a critical role}} in virus <b>morphogenesis.</b> This protein is a 63 amino acid membrane spanning protein which locates itself in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cleavage of p7 is mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum's signal peptidases. Two transmembrane domains of p7 are connected by a cytoplasmic loop and are oriented towards the endoplasmic reticulum's lumen.|$|E
25|$|Studies of A. thaliana have {{provided}} considerable insights {{with regards to}} the genetics of leaf <b>morphogenesis,</b> particularly in dicotyledon-type plants. Much of the understanding has come from analyzing mutants in leaf development, some of which were identified in the 1960s, but were not analysed with genetic and molecular techniques until the mid-1990s. A. thaliana leaves are well suited to studies of leaf development because they are relatively simple and stable.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{majority}} of plant cells have a cell wall that defines their morphology and impedes their movement, their microfilaments can generate sufficient force to achieve a number of cellular activities, such as, the cytoplasmic currents generated by the microfilaments and myosin. Actin is also involved in the movement of organelles and in cellular <b>morphogenesis,</b> which involve cell division {{as well as the}} elongation and differentiation of the cell.|$|E
25|$|The {{cells are}} {{sensitive}} to the environment, such as gel stiffness and contact with other cells. Individual cells do not thrive; a minimum of four proximate cells was required for subsequent organoid development. Modifications to the medium composition produced either hollow spheres mainly composed of pancreatic progenitors, or complex organoids that spontaneously undergo pancreatic <b>morphogenesis</b> and differentiation. Maintenance and expansion of pancreatic progenitors require active Notch and FGF signaling, recapitulating in vivo niche signaling interactions.|$|E
25|$|Many genes {{associated}} with syndromic cases of cleft lip/palate (see above) {{have been identified}} {{to contribute to the}} incidence of isolated cases of cleft lip/palate. This includes in particular sequence variants in the genes IRF6, PVRL1 and MSX1. The understanding of the genetic complexities involved in the <b>morphogenesis</b> of the midface, including molecular and cellular processes, has been greatly aided by research on animal models, including of the genes BMP4, SHH, SHOX2, FGF10 and MSX1.|$|E
25|$|Cell walls serve similar {{purposes}} in those organisms that possess them. They may give cells rigidity and strength, offering protection against mechanical stress. In multicellular organisms, they permit the organism {{to build and}} hold a definite shape (<b>morphogenesis).</b> Cell walls also limit the entry of large molecules that may be toxic to the cell. They further permit the creation of stable osmotic environments by preventing osmotic lysis and helping to retain water. Their composition, properties, and form may change during the cell cycle and depend on growth conditions.|$|E
25|$|The noncanonical PCP pathway regulates cell morphology, division, and movement. Once again Wnt {{proteins}} binds to and activates Frizzled so that Frizzled activates a Dishevelled {{protein that}} is {{tethered to the}} plasma membrane through a Prickle protein and transmembrane Stbm protein. The active Dishevelled activates RhoA GTPase through Dishevelled associated activator of <b>morphogenesis</b> 1 (Daam1) and the Rac protein. Active RhoA is able to induce cytoskeleton changes by activating Roh-associated kinase (ROCK) and affect gene transcription directly. Active Rac can directly induce cytoskeleton changes and affect gene transcription through activation of JNK.|$|E
25|$|Pattern {{formation}} in the <b>morphogenesis</b> of an animal is regulated by genetic induction factors that put cells to work after damage has occurred. Neural cells, for example, express growth-associated proteins, such as GAP-43, tubulin, actin, an array of novel neuropeptides, and cytokines that induce a cellular physiological response to regenerate from the damage. Many of the genes {{that are involved in}} the original development of tissues are reinitialized during the regenerative process. Cells in the primordia of zebrafish fins, for example, express four genes from the homeobox msx family during development and regeneration.|$|E
