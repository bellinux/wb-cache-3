50|$|Typically the {{coercivity}} of {{a magnetic}} material {{is determined by}} measurement of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop,</b> also called the magnetization curve, as illustrated in the figure. The apparatus used to acquire the data is typically a vibrating-sample or alternating-gradient magnetometer. The applied field where the data line crosses zero is the coercivity. If an antiferromagnet {{is present in the}} sample, the coercivities measured in increasing and decreasing fields may be unequal {{as a result of the}} exchange bias effect.|$|E
50|$|The default {{definition}} of magnetic remanence is the magnetization remaining in zero field after a large magnetic field is applied (enough to achieve saturation). The {{effect of a}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop</b> is measured using instruments such as a vibrating sample magnetometer; and the zero-field intercept {{is a measure of}} the remanence. In physics this measure is converted to an average magnetization (the total magnetic moment divided by the volume of the sample) and denoted in equations as Mr. If it must be distinguished from other kinds of remanence, then it is called the saturation remanence or saturation isothermal remanence (SIRM) and denoted by Mrs.|$|E

50|$|Hysteresis can be {{a dynamic}} lag between an input and an output that disappears if the input is varied more slowly; {{this is known as}} rate-dependent hysteresis. However, {{phenomena}} such as the <b>magnetic</b> <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loops</b> are mainly rate-independent, which makes possible a durable memory.|$|R
50|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop</b> of an {{exchange}} spring magnet theoretically {{takes on a}} shape resembling that of a summation of its hard and soft magnetic components (as seen in Figure 1), meaning its energy product is {{higher than those of}} its components. A magnet’s maximum energy product (BH)max, which is roughly proportional to its coercivity (HC) and magnetization saturation (Msat), is used as a metric of its ability to do magnetic work as (BH)max is twice the magnet’s available magnetostatic energy. The exchange spring magnet offers a geometry able to improve upon the previously reported maximum energy products of materials such as Rare Earth/Transition Metal complexes; while both materials have sufficiently large HC values and operate at relatively high Curie Temperatures, the exchange spring magnet can achieve much higher Msat values than the Rare Earth/Transition Metal (RE-TM) complexes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Since the {{magnetostrictive}} actuator is a nonlinear {{plant with}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop,</b> its multiple frequency active vibration control is more complicated. In this paper, a Simple Hyperstable Adaptive Recursive Filter (SHARF) algorithm based on nonlinear model is proposed. The nonlinear model of magnetostrictive actuator is obtained by using radial basis neural network. The experimental result {{show that the}} proposed approach is real-time efficient. An attenuation of about 30 dB is achieved.
