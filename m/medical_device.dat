Since 2001, Germany has had in place a regulatory framework that does not distinguish between the reprocessing of “reusable” and so-called “single-use” <b>medical</b> <b>devices.</b> The guidelines, therefore, allow for SUD reprocessing if conformance with certain standards is achieved. The German <b>Medical</b> <b>Devices</b> Law and the <b>Medical</b> <b>Devices</b> Operator Ordinance regulate the reprocessing of <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> {{and in doing so}} refer to the mutual recommendation by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and the Federal Institute for Drugs and <b>Medical</b> <b>Devices</b> (BfArM) for the reprocessing of <b>medical</b> <b>devices.</b> As a result, the RKI’s requirements must be observed.|$|R
5|$|During {{the debate}} on health care reform, Franken {{was one of the}} strongest {{supporters}} of a single-payer system. He authored an amendment, called the Medical Loss Ratio, to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that required insurance companies spend at least 80% of premiums on actual health care costs, rising to 85% for large group plans. On September 30, 2013, Franken voted to remove a provision that would repeal the <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> tax in Obamacare from a government funding bill.

Today, the city remains an important distribution hub for companies such as Nestlé Purina PetCare, and is home to Lowell Observatory, The U.S. Naval Observatory, the United States Geological Survey Flagstaff Station, and Northern Arizona University. Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to Grand Canyon National Park, Oak Creek Canyon, the Arizona Snowbowl, Meteor Crater, and historic Route 66.

40|$|Nowadays, {{it lacks}} an open, {{standardized}} and dynamic interconnection of <b>medical</b> <b>devices.</b> All existing combinations of <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> consist of isolated solutions with proprietary interfaces, as no common standards for networking and {{the exchange of}} data of <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> exist. This situation leads to confusing operating rooms and inefficient operations. Thus, new strategies {{need to be developed}} for the authorization of dynamically interconnected <b>medical</b> <b>devices.</b> Primarily, those concern of an acquisition and methodical adaption of new requirements and risks resulting from this way of interconnection. The approach is to develop a method for a risk analysis for interconnected <b>medical</b> <b>devices,</b> which is structured modular and consists of a risk assessment of the standalone device and a risk analysis for the interconnection considering the risks involved in the transfer of functions. When interconnecting the <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> the risk analysis of each of the devices is taken and they are compared by a gap analysis. Through this strategy {{it will be possible to}} realize a standard-compliant dynamic interconnection of medical products, which would be advantageous both for clinic operators and producers.
