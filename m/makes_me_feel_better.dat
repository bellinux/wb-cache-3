50|$|The {{band was}} {{originally}} the solo project of Virginia-born Shilough Hopwood (singer, multi-instrumentalist, and songwriter). Shilough wrote {{many of the}} tracks on the bands 2004 release, <b>Makes</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Better.</b> Larissa Hopwood joined in 1999. She plays bass and sings both lead and harmony vocals. Lead guitarist Tim Kratz joined Honeychurch in 2001, and with his presence, the live band took shape. Kratzs playing combined slide guitar and B-Bender techniques and is often mistaken for pedal steel. Drummer Greg Millward joined Honeychurch in 2004, replacing Stefan Baker. A native of Doncaster, England (in Yorkshire), Millward started playing drums in the brass bands which are traditional in Northern England, and also played in Thumper and other groups in England before joining Honeychurch in 2004. Since 2008, Alex Yaker (frontman for the band Roomtone) has played piano with Honeychurch both at live shows and in the studio, and Ivan Funk joined the band on pedal steel in 2012.|$|E

5000|$|Cue a brief {{break from}} Magneta Lane for all involved. No thought was ever given to ending the band, {{but it was}} some time before Lexi felt {{compelled}} to return to songwriting again. And then “it was me in the basement on this really awful recording program by myself with a guitar and a bass, just trying to write songs that would <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> {{about what was going}} on.” A new manager and a chance link-up at a party with Rick Jackett and James Black of Toronto modern-rock hitmakers Finger Eleven added further focus to Lexi’s renewed creative energies. Jackett and Black, she was surprised to learn, shared a great deal of Magneta Lane’s musical tastes and subsequently became fast friends - friends soon to be entrusted with the task of producing Magneta Lane’s next recording. “Those guys are really, really cool,” says Lexi. “I {{know a lot of people}} will be, like: ‘What does Magneta Lane have to do with Finger Eleven. How is there a connect there?’ To answer that, they’re fans of exactly the same music that we love even though our bands are so different from one another. They are good people with an unbiased opinion, that don’t buy into that buzz band bullshit. Creative minds. It was refreshing.”“They were very encouraging. They never said: ‘This is the way the song should sound. Let’s turn this into a brand-new song.’ They were always, like: ‘Lex, this is really good. Now you’ve gotta go back and try again and make it better.’ We needed that kind of encouragement and perspective to grow.” The collaboration catalyzed the intriguing new phase of Magneta Lane’s career heralded by Witchrock. “Burn” plays up the tougher rhythmic intensity hinted at on Dancing With Daggers and introduces a huskier, more mature iteration of Lexi Valentine, the vocalist, whose alto now channels seminal proto-punk forebears as Hynde and Harry with much more bite and confidence. “Good For” chugs forth with newfound drama reminiscent of Shirley Manson and Garbage, while “Leave the Light On” - with its barbed assertions that “strange girls need strange things to keep them awake” - genuinely qualifies as anthemic. “Lucky,” meanwhile, revisits what the Magneta Lane of old did with a more refined command of what it is Magneta Lane does. The Witchrock title comes from the band’s inability to find an accurate genre classification for its sound while recording. “What do we even call this? What genre is this? Is it rock? Is it alternative? Is it pop?” laughs Lexi, who decided to embrace her “inner villain” and air all her grievances about the past few years’ trials in the Witchrock lyric sheet. “We decided to make our own genre because we couldn’t figure out where we fit. We decided it sounds kind of witchy. People have said that to us before. Maybe it’s because we’re three girls. Maybe it’s something worse, I don’t know. Or care at this point.” In any case, Magneta Lane is moving upward and onward again. Lexi Valentine doesn’t feel she has a choice in the matter. Indeed, she’s recently found renewed inspiration to keep soldiering on despite everything in Patti Smith’s memoir, Just Kids. “I love it. It’s a beautiful book. I love it so much,” she says. “There’s this one part where she’s talking about how she went to see Jim Morrison and the Doors. She loved Jim Morrison, obviously, and he was a big inspiration to her, but when she saw him onstage, instead of having the thoughts that every other person would have - ‘Oh my god, this is the greatest performer I’ve ever seen’ she was like: ‘I can do that.’ “That thought goes back to why we started the band. I really feel that way and I encourage every girl or boy who feels that way to do it because, to be honest, if WE can be in a band, any person who has the passion enough can do it. There was something really inspiring in knowing that Patti Smith felt the same way. I didn’t have to feel guilty about the fact that I was never that girl who would look at a male rock star and think ‘I wanna be with him.’ For me, it was always ‘I want that for myself.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{heart was}} touched by your regret that I hadn't given you [...] "a great deal of my news"--though my reason {{suggested}} that I could not have given you what there was not to give. [...] "La plus belle fille du monde ne peut donner que ce qu'elle a." [...] I turn out news in very small quantities--it is impossible to imagine an existence less pervaded with any sort of chiaroscuro. I am turning into an old, and very contented, Parisian: I feel as if I had struck roots into the Parisian soil, and were likely to let them grow tangled and tenacious there. It is a very comfortable and profitable place, on the whole--I mean, especially, on its general and cosmopolitan side. Of pure Parisianism I see absolutely nothing. The great merit of the place is that one can arrange one's life here exactly as one pleases--that there are facilities for every kind of habit and taste, and that everything is accepted and understood. Paris itself meanwhile {{is a sort of}} painted background which keeps shifting and changing, and which is always there, to be looked at when you please, and to be most easily and comfortably ignored when you don't. All this, if you were only here, you would <b>feel</b> much <b>better</b> than I can tell you--and you would write some happy piece of your prose about it which would <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> it <b>better,</b> afresh. Ergo, come--when you can! I shall probably be here still. Of course every good thing is still better in spring, and in spite of much mean weather I have been liking Paris these last weeks more than ever. In fact I have accepted destiny here, under the vernal influence. If you sometimes read my poor letters in the Tribune, you get a notion of some of the things I see and do. I suppose also you get some gossip about me from Quincy St. Besides this there is not a great deal to tell. I have seen a certain number of people all winter who have helped to pass the time, but I have formed but one or two relations of permanent value, and which I desire to perpetuate. I have seen almost nothing of the literary fraternity, and there are fifty reasons why I should not become intimate with them. I don't like their wares, and they don't like any others; and besides, they are not accueillants. Turgenev is worth the whole heap of them, and yet he himself swallows them down in a manner that excites my extreme wonder. But he is the most loveable of men and takes all things easily. He is so pure and strong a genius that he doesn't need to be on the defensive as regards his opinions and enjoyments. The mistakes he may make don't hurt him. His modesty and naïveté are simply infantine. I gave him some time since the message you sent him, and he bade me to thank you very kindly and to say that he had the most agreeable memory of your two books. He has just gone to Russia to bury himself for two or three months on his estate, and try and finish a long novel he has for three or four years been working upon. I hope to heaven he may. I suspect he works little here.|$|R
