5|$|Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin (18 February 1963– 16 August 1996), {{best known}} by his pen name Udin, was an Indonesian {{journalist}} who {{was murdered in}} 1996. A reporter at the Yogyakarta, Java, daily newspaper Bernas, he published {{a series of articles}} on corruption in the Bantul Regency in the months before his death. On 13 August, he was attacked at his house by two unidentified assailants using a <b>metal</b> <b>rod</b> and taken to the hospital. He died three days later without regaining consciousness.|$|E
5|$|On 13 August 1996 {{at around}} 10:30pm local time (UTC+7), Udin {{received}} two visitors outside {{his home in}} Bantul, off Parangtritis Road. The visitors claimed to want to leave a motorcycle with him for safekeeping, and reportedly had come the day before as well. While his wife Marsiyem was preparing tea, the men attacked him with a <b>metal</b> <b>rod,</b> striking {{him in the head}} and stomach. The assailants then escaped on a motorcycle they had parked in front of his home. Marsiyem found Udin unconscious on the ground, bleeding from his ears.|$|E
5|$|The Dangerous Alliance was a {{dominant}} force in WCW. At {{one point during}} 1992, they held every title except the WCW World Title, which was held by their main opponent and arch enemy Sting. The war between the Dangerous Alliance and Sting and friends escalated until {{it was decided to}} settle it in a double ring War Games Match at WrestleWar 1992. Sting's team won when Sting forced Eaton to give up after Larry Zbyszko accidentally struck Eaton in the arm with a <b>metal</b> <b>rod.</b> This match would be given a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter.|$|E

5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong {{on the surface and}} became the second human to set foot on the Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a <b>metal</b> <b>rod</b> to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on January 4, 1974—around {{the time that}} he {{terminated}} his relationship with Brooks—Bundy entered the basement apartment of 18-year-old Karen Sparks (identified as Joni Lenz, Mary Adams or Terri Caldwell by various sources), a dancer and student at UW. After bludgeoning the sleeping woman senseless with a <b>metal</b> <b>rod</b> from her bed frame, he sexually assaulted her with either the same rod, or a metal speculum, causing extensive internal injuries. She remained unconscious for 10 days, but survived with permanent disabilities. Less than a month later, {{in the early morning hours}} of February 1, Bundy broke into the basement room of Lynda Ann Healy, a UW undergraduate who broadcast morning radio weather reports for skiers. He beat her unconscious, dressed her in blue jeans, a white blouse, and boots, and carried her away.|$|E
25|$|The {{three sides}} of the flag not {{attached}} to the pole are decorated with fringes of golden thread (5–7cm long) and tassels of the same material (10–12cm long) hang {{from the corners of}} the fly. The flag is attached to the pole by an antioxidant <b>metal</b> <b>rod</b> 70cm long.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1879 the tower was struck by lightning. Cracks {{subsequently}} appeared in the masonry walls, which was remedied by placing a <b>metal</b> <b>rod</b> to connect the iron work of the tower with an iron disk sunk in the ground. In 1912 the candlepower of the light was increased from 27,000 to 80,000.|$|E
25|$|The early “H” {{metal base}} (the SAX {{standard}} {{model and the}} LAX lounge lower model), “X” metal base (the DAX dining model), a lower model with <b>metal</b> <b>rod</b> base (the LAR model), a wooden base (the DSW model), a steel-wire base (the DSR model, {{also known as the}} “Eiffel-Tower base”), a cast aluminium base with castors (the PACC model), and a wood-rocker base (the RAR model). All of the bases were attached to the seat using hard rubber disks to allow flexibility.|$|E
25|$|The entire plateau {{on which}} the {{buildings}} and graveyard lie is walled. In the grounds around the buildings an extensive graveyard includes a number of high crosses. Scully's Cross, {{one of the largest}} and most famous high crosses here, originally constructed in 1867 to commemorate the Scully family, was destroyed in 1976 when lightning struck a <b>metal</b> <b>rod</b> that ran the length of the cross. The remains of the top of the cross now lie at the base of the cross adjacent to the rock wall.|$|E

25|$|Bradford Reed {{invented the}} pencilina, a {{custom-made}} string instrument in the 1980s. It is a double-neck 3rd bridge guitar {{that is similar}} in construction to two long, thin zithers connected by a stand. Wedged over and under the strings in each neck is an adjustable rod, a wooden drum stick for the guitar strings and a <b>metal</b> <b>rod</b> for the bass strings. In addition, there are four bells. The pencilina is played by striking its strings and bells with sticks. The strings may also be plucked or bowed.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a number}} of famous life stories showing the same causal connection. For example, P. Gage was a well-respected, well-liked, and {{responsible}} gentleman. In 1848 because of a construction accident he suffered a serious damage to his brain when a <b>metal</b> <b>rod</b> propelled by an explosive entered his lower left cheek and exited from the top-middle part of his head. Gage healed quickly. After that accident, however, he became erratic, disrespectful, and vulgar. Gage had been transformed from a well-controlled, well-respected person to an individual with psychopathic traits.|$|E
25|$|Artisans used {{a mass of}} mud {{and straw}} fixed around a <b>metal</b> <b>rod</b> to form a core, and built up a vessel by either dipping the core in liquified glass, or by {{trailing}} liquid glass over the core. The core was removed after the glass had cooled, and handles, rims and bases were then added. These vessels are characterised by relatively thick walls, bright colours and zigzagging patterns of contrasting colours, and were limited in size to small unguent or scent containers. This early technique continued in popularity during the 1st century BC, despite the earlier introduction of slumped and cast vessels.|$|E

25|$|In 1827, Wheatstone {{introduced}} his 'kaleidophone', a device for rendering the vibrations of a sounding body apparent to the eye. It {{consists of a}} <b>metal</b> <b>rod,</b> carrying at its end a silvered bead, which reflects a 'spot' of light. As the rod vibrates the spot is seen to describe complicated figures in the air, like a spark whirled about in the darkness. His photometer was probably suggested by this appliance. It enables two lights to be compared by the relative brightness of their reflections in a silvered bead, which describes a narrow ellipse, so as to draw the spots into parallel lines.|$|E
25|$|The idea {{of using}} a grid for control was {{patented}} by Lee de Forest, resulting in considerable research into alternate tube designs that would avoid his patents. One concept used a magnetic field instead of an electrical charge to control current flow, leading {{to the development of}} the magnetron tube. In this design, the tube was made with two electrodes, typically with the cathode in the form of a <b>metal</b> <b>rod</b> in the center, and the anode as a cylinder around it. The tube was placed between the poles of a horseshoe magnet arranged such that the magnetic field was aligned parallel to the axis of the electrodes.|$|E
25|$|Corrosion from {{tellurium}} - The reactor makes {{small amounts}} of tellurium as a fission product. In the MSRE, this caused {{small amounts of}} corrosion at the grain boundaries of the special nickel alloy, Hastelloy-N. Metallurgical studies showed that adding 1 to 2% niobium to the Hastelloy-N alloy improves resistance to corrosion by tellurium. Maintaining the ratio of / to less than 60 reduced corrosion by keeping the fuel salt slightly reducing. The MSRE continually contacted the flowing fuel salt with a beryllium <b>metal</b> <b>rod</b> submerged in a cage inside the pump bowl. This caused a fluorine shortage in the salt, reducing tellurium to a less aggressive (elemental) form. This method is also effective in reducing corrosion in general, because the fission process produces more fluorine atoms that would otherwise attack the structural metals.|$|E

500|$|The Rhodes piano {{features}} a keyboard {{with a similar}} layout to a traditional acoustic piano, but some models contain 73 keys instead of 88. The touch and action of the keyboard {{is designed to be}} as close to a piano as possible. Pressing a key results in a hammer striking a thin <b>metal</b> <b>rod</b> called a tine connected to a larger [...] "tone bar". The whole [...] "tone generator assembly" [...] acts as a tuning fork, the tone bar reinforcing and extending the vibrations of the tine. A pickup sits opposite the tine, picking up its vibrations and inducing an electric current in a similar manner to an electric guitar. The basic mechanical act of hitting tines does not need an external power supply, and a Rhodes will make sound even when not plugged into an amplifier, though like an unplugged electric guitar the sound will be weak.|$|E
500|$|The islanders also {{supported}} themselves through fishing, exploiting the high-quality catches {{that were to}} be made around the island's coasts. James Traill Calder wrote in his 1861 Sketch of the Civil and Traditional History of Caithness that [...] "The finest cod in the north is to be got in the Pentland Firth... Large and excellent lobsters are caught around the island [...]" [...] As well as trapping lobsters, the islanders practised hand line cod fishing {{in the waters of}} the Firth. This involved towing lengths of line with heavy weights and a <b>metal</b> <b>rod</b> or sprool at one end, from which hung a short length of hemp and hook baited with limpets. To encourage the fish to bite, the boats had to be held still by their rowers, which required great skill in the Firth's unpredictable currents. The island was noted for its native type of boat, the Stroma yole, which was a direct descendant of the old Norse longship.|$|E
500|$|Francis Aaron (Ralph Brown), nicknamed [...] "Eighty-Five" [...] for his IQ, is Andrews' {{assistant}} and a prison guard. After Andrews' death, Aaron {{tries to take}} charge but the prisoners refute his authority. Ripley tells him several times that the Weyland-Yutani company does not care about him or any other employee, and {{are more interested in}} acquiring the Aliens. Aaron refuses to send the rescue ship away because he wants to see his family again. He helps Ripley with the bio-scan she performs on herself on the crashed spacecraft, and they discover that she has been impregnated with an Alien chestburster. Weyland-Yutani immediately informs the prison that a rescue ship will arrive in several hours to pick her up, and Aaron concludes that the corporation only wants the Aliens. When the prisoners decide to lure the alien into the molten lead, he calls them crazy and locks himself in his office. Michael Bishop lands with his team and tries to convince Ripley to leave with him; Aaron hits him with a large <b>metal</b> <b>rod,</b> nearly ripping his ear off, and is shot dead by Bishop's team.|$|E
