5000|$|Traditional {{aircraft}} inlets contain many heavy <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> In comparison, DSI completely eliminates all <b>moving</b> <b>parts,</b> {{which makes}} it far less complex and more reliable than earlier diverter-plate inlets. The removal of <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> also reduces the overall weight of the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The design {{features}} no <b>moving</b> <b>parts,</b> which the creators claim increases reliability compared to conventional engines with <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Movement: Machines or {{instruments}} with <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> {{may affect}} isolation systems. It {{is important to}} know the mass, speed, and distance traveled of the <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fatigue {{is related}} to large {{inertial}} forces, and {{is affected by the}} type of motion that a <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> has. A <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> that has a uniform rotation motion is subject to less fatigue than a <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> that oscillates back and forth. Vibration leads to failure when the forcing frequency of the machine's operation hits a resonant frequency of one or more <b>moving</b> <b>parts,</b> such as rotating shafts. Designers avoid this by calculating the natural frequencies of the parts at design time, and altering the parts to limit or eliminate such resonance.|$|R
50|$|Two {{means are}} used for {{overcoming}} the efficiency losses caused by friction between <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> First, <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> are lubricated. Second, the <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> of a machine are designed so {{that they have a}} small amount of contact with one another. The latter, in its turn, comprises two approaches. A machine can be reduced in size, thereby quite simply reducing the areas of the <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> that rub against one another; and the designs of the individual components can be modified, changing their shapes and structures to reduce or avoid contact with one another.|$|R
50|$|The <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> of {{a machine}} are those parts of it that move. Machines include both moving (or movable) and fixed <b>parts.</b> The <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> have {{controlled}} and constrained motions.|$|R
30|$|A further {{positive}} characteristic is {{that the}} cluster do not contain <b>moving</b> <b>parts,</b> such as fans or hard disk drives. The lack of <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> makes the cluster less error prone.|$|R
5000|$|The {{amount of}} <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> in a machine {{is a factor}} in its {{mechanical}} efficiency. The greater the number of <b>moving</b> <b>parts,</b> the greater the amount of energy lost to heat by friction between those parts. [...] In a modern automobile engine, for example, roughly 7% of the total power obtained from burning the engine's fuel is lost to friction between the engine's <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In recent decades, {{the use of}} {{animation}} has become more practical and widespread in technical and engineering diagrams for the illustration of the motions of <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> Animation represents <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> more clearly and enables them and their motions to be more readily visualized. [...] Furthermore, computer aided design tools allow the motions of <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> to be simulated, allowing machine designers to determine, for example, whether the <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> in a given design would obstruct one another's motion or collide by simple visual inspection of the (animated) computer model {{rather than by the}} designer performing a numerical analysis directly.|$|R
50|$|Passive orthoses do {{not require}} {{external}} power and {{are less likely to}} have <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> However, many passive orthoses have been developed to aid movement through use of springs and other such <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R
40|$|A numeral control micropositioning {{workpiece}} {{table is}} presented that is mainly {{made up of}} a <b>moving</b> <b>part,</b> a base, three piezoelectric translators, and three capacitive sensors. An elastic structure with three half-notch flexure hinges is used to generate preload for piezoelectric translators. With the aid of the FEM, the structural dimensions of the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> and flexure hinges is designed with the consideration of stiffness match between the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> and the piezoelectric translators. Meanwhile, the position of flexure hinges is also chosen to reduce bending deformation of the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> and to enlarge external dimensions of the workpiece table. The theoretical algorithm of the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> rotating about an arbitrary symmetric axis is developed. The experimental results illustrate that the workpiece table has a nature frequency of 584 Hz, an open loop control stiffness of 104 N/μm at the central point of the <b>moving</b> <b>part,</b> a closed loop control stiffness of 650 N/μm at work area of the table, a resolution of 6 nm and a positioning accuracy of 49 nm...|$|R
50|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{have fewer}} <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> than reciprocating compressors which, theoretically, should improve reliability. According to Emerson Climate Technologies, manufacturer of Copeland scroll compressors, scroll compressors have 70 percent fewer <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> than conventional reciprocating compressors.|$|R
5000|$|Conversely, {{the fewer}} {{the number of}} <b>moving</b> <b>parts,</b> the greater the efficiency. Machines with no <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> at all can be very efficient. An {{electrical}} transformer, for example, has no <b>moving</b> <b>parts,</b> and its mechanical efficiency is generally above the 90% mark. (The remaining power losses in a transformer are from other causes, including loss to electrical resistance in the copper windings and hysteresis loss and eddy current loss in the iron core.) ...|$|R
5000|$|One final, particular, factor {{related to}} failure of <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> is kinetic energy. The sudden {{release of the}} kinetic energy of the <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> of a machine causes {{overstress}} failures if a <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> is impeded in its motion by a foreign object, such as stone caught on the blades of a fan or propellor, or even the proverbial [...] "spanner/monkey wrench in the works". (See foreign object damage for further discussion of this.) ...|$|R

40|$|Frictional {{characteristics}} of a small aerostatic linear bearing are accurately evaluated {{by means of a}} method, in which the force acting on the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> of the bearing is measured as the inertial force. An optical interferometer is newly developed to measure the Doppler shift frequency of the laser light reflected on the small <b>moving</b> <b>part.</b> From the measured time-varying Doppler shift frequency, the velocity, the position, the acceleration and the inertial force of the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> are numerically calculated. It is confirmed that the dynamic frictional force acting inside the bearing is almost proportional to the velocity of the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> and is similar to the theoretical value calculated under the assumption that the flow inside the bearing is the Couette flow...|$|R

50|$|A bearing is {{a machine}} element that {{constrains}} relative motion to only the desired motion, and reduces friction between <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> The {{design of the}} bearing may, for example, provide for free linear movement of the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> or for free rotation around a fixed axis; or, it may prevent a motion by controlling the vectors of normal forces that bear on the <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> Most bearings facilitate the desired motion by minimizing friction. Bearings are classified broadly according {{to the type of}} operation, the motions allowed, or to the directions of the loads (forces) applied to the parts.|$|R
