5|$|The Southern Railway was {{primarily}} a passenger-carrying railway which used most of its resources to extend its electrified lines. There was a continuing need for steam freight locomotives however, although the Traffic Department preferred <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> designs which could also haul passenger trains on the remaining non-electrified lines at peak periods. By the late 1930s the Southern Railway was adequately served with powerful <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> locomotives of the S15 and N and N1 classes, {{but there was a}} need for a smaller freight locomotive with high route availability that could also undertake light passenger duties. This role had been performed by the ex-LSWR 'Jubilee' A12 0-4-2, which were approaching the end of their useful lives.|$|E
5|$|As {{the size}} of train increased, so did the locomotives. The 4-6-0 wheel {{arrangement}} became popular for passenger and <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> work with the D3 and A2 classes, and the 2-8-0 arrangement on goods with the K, J and C classes lasting into the 1960s. These were then followed by the 4-6-2 S class Pacifics for the Spirit of Progress express, and the single 4-8-4 H class locomotive H220, the biggest Victorian Railways steam locomotive. The final steam locomotives built for the Victorian Railways were the 4-6-4 R class and 2-8-0 J classes. Although they were of more modern design, their advantages were overshadowed by the simultaneous arrival of the first diesels.|$|E

50|$|With the IEEE {{standard}} 802.1ad, double-tagging can {{be useful}} for Internet service providers, allowing them to use VLANs internally while <b>mixing</b> <b>traffic</b> from clients that are already VLAN-tagged. The outer (next to source MAC and representing ISP VLAN) S-TAG (service tag) comes first, followed by the inner C-TAG (customer tag). In such cases, 802.1ad specifies a TPID of 0x88a8 for service-provider outer S-TAG.|$|R

25|$|BR {{adopted a}} {{slightly}} {{modified version of}} the LMS classification system, itself based on the Midland Railway's system. Each locomotive class was given a number 0–9 that signified its power, 0 for the least powerful and 9 for the most, with a suffix of F or P, indicating freight and passenger roles respectively. Freight power ranged from 0–9, passenger from 0–8. Many locomotives were used for both roles, in which case they were given two class numbers, the P-rating first e.g. 3P4F or 6P5F. A slight change from the LMS system saw those where the freight classification (x) equalled the passenger classification (also x) reclassified as xMT, MT standing for <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic,</b> e.g. for the LMS Black Five locomotives, LMS 5P5F became BR 5MT. <b>Mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> locos had power in the range of classes 2–6.|$|E
25|$|Tracks on {{all three}} lines are usually {{in the center of}} the street; however, the {{southbound}} tracks between the Wheeler and MuseumDistrict stations run along the left side, and the downtown Houston tracks along Capitol and Rusk streets run along the south side of the streets. Furthermore, the tracks on Capitol and Rusk run in <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic,</b> sharing a lane with buses and other vehicles, like streetcars.|$|E
25|$|When first built, the St. Clair {{streetcar}} {{operated in}} a dedicated right-of-way, {{similar to the}} modern 510 Spadina route. A dedicated right-of-way is a lane generally in {{the centre of the}} street, reserved for transit vehicles. However, it was removed between 1928 and 1935 and replaced with paved trackage open to <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic.</b> The TTC later came to regret this decision, and in 2005 it began rebuilding a dedicated streetcar right-of-way.|$|E
50|$|Initially the {{provision}} of a 10 lane Underpass (2 Lanes for Metro Bus and 8 Lanes for <b>mix</b> <b>traffic)</b> along the 9th Avenue was proposed at Peshawar Mor intersection. Later on, {{in view of the}} traffic issues at Peshawar Mor intersection, ongoing Widening/Rehabilitation of Kashmir Highway & its link with new Islamabad Airport, it was decided to dovetail the Metro Bus corridor in the interchange already designed by CDA which will cost Rs. 6.75 Billion.

25|$|In 1968, {{while there}} had been a <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> of buses and trams, total {{ridership}} had been 2.1 million. In 1969, ridership had fallen to 1.6 million, a reduction of 24 percent. From 1978, the route was moved back to the old route performed by the tram, and remained unchanged as Line 63 until 2008. The headway was steadily reduced, and {{in the end it was}} at 45 minutes.|$|E

25|$|A city {{car is a}} small {{automobile}} {{intended for}} use in urban areas. Unlike microcars, a city car's greater speed, capacity and (in perception at least) occupant protection are safer in <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> environments and weather conditions. While city cars can reach highway speeds, that is not their intended use. In Japan, city cars are called kei cars.

40|$|Abstract — The information-theoretic {{analysis}} of Chaum mixing under latency constraints is considered. Mixes are relay nodes that collect packets from multiple users and modify packet timings {{to prevent an}} eavesdropper from identifying the sources of outgoing packets. In this work, an entropy-based metric of anonymity is proposed to quantify {{the performance of a}} mixing strategy under strict delay constraints. Inner and outer bounds on the maximum achievable anonymity are characterized as functions of traffic load and the delay constraint. The bounds are shown to have identical first derivatives at low traffic loads. Index Terms — <b>mixing,</b> <b>traffic</b> analysis, anonymity, timing channels. I...|$|R

25|$|Garratts {{enjoy an}} {{advantage}} over the Mallet system, because of the geometry of the design. When swinging around curves the boiler and cab unit move inward like a bowstring in the bow of a curve and this reduces the centrifugal force that would overturn a normal locomotive and which in turn permits faster running. The Mallet's forward articulated unit tends to throw out as the loco rounds curves. While most Garratts were designed for freight or <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic,</b> there were several passenger Garratt classes. A Garratt holds the world speed record for an articulated locomotive.|$|E
25|$|From 1877 to 1888 the ERA {{struggled}} {{to keep up with}} even basic maintenance but by 1887 Trevithick managed to start a programme to renew 85 of the very mixed fleet of locomotives with new boilers, cylinders and motion. The others he started to replace with four standard locomotive types introduced from 1889 onwards: one class of 0-6-0 for freight, one class of 2-4-0 for <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic,</b> one 0-6-0T tank locomotive for shunting and one class of only ten 2-2-2 locomotives for express passenger trains. Trevithick ensured that these four classes shared as many common components as possible, which simplified maintenance and reduced costs still further.|$|E
25|$|OC Transpo, a {{department}} of the city, operates the public transit system. An integrated hub-and-spoke system of services consists of: regular buses traveling on fixed routes in <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic,</b> typical of most urban transit systems; a bus rapid transit (BRT) system which is a high-frequency bus service operating on the transitway (a network of mostly grade-separated dedicated bus lanes within their own right of way) and having full stations with Park & Ride facilities, further supported by on-road reserved bus lanes and priority traffic signal controls; a light rail transit (LRT) system known as the O-Train operating on one north-south route (the Trillium Line); and a door-to-door bus service for the disabled known as ParaTranspo. Both OC Transpo and the Quebec-based Société de transport de l'Outaouais (STO) operate bus services between Ottawa and Gatineau.|$|E
40|$|Several {{previous}} studies have used the Cellular Automaton (CA) for the modeling of bicycle traffic flow. However, previous CA models have several limitations, resulting in differences between the simulated and the observed traffic flow features. The primary objective {{of this study is}} to propose a modified CA model for simulating the characteristics of <b>mixed</b> bicycle <b>traffic</b> flow. Field data were collected on physically separated bicycle path in Shanghai, China, and were used to calibrate the CA model using the genetic algorithm. Traffic flow features between simulations of several CA models and field observations were compared. The results showed that our modified CA model produced more accurate simulation for the fundamental diagram and the passing events in <b>mixed</b> bicycle <b>traffic</b> flow. Based on our model, the bicycle traffic flow features, including the fundamental diagram, the number of passing events, and the number of lane changes, were analyzed. We also analyzed the traffic flow features with different traffic densities, traffic components on different travel lanes. Results of the study can provide important information for understanding and simulating the operations of <b>mixed</b> bicycle <b>traffic</b> flow...|$|R
