Philately, phillumeny, and deltiology (collecting postage stamps, <b>matchboxes,</b> and postcards) are forms of collecting which can be undertaken at minimal expense.|$|E

25|$|The revolt {{started on}} January 10, 1923. Arriving with trains to Kretinga and Tauragė, 1,090 volunteers (40 officers, 584 soldiers, 455 riflemen, 3 clerks, 2 doctors, 6 orderlies) {{crossed the border}} into the region. Among them were Steponas Darius and Vladas Putvinskis. They wore {{civilian}} clothes and had green armband with letters MLS for Mažosios Lietuvos sukilėlis or Mažosios Lietuvos savanoris (rebel/volunteer of Lithuania Minor). Each man had a rifle and 200 bullets; the rebels had a total of 21 light machine guns, 4 motorcycles, 3 cars, 63 horses. In hopes to negotiate a peaceful retreat of the French and to avoid any casualties, shooting was allowed {{only as a last}} resort of self-defense. Galvanauskas ordered perfect behavior (politeness, no plunder, no alcoholic drinks, no political speeches) and no Lithuanian identification (no Lithuanian documents, money, tobacco, or <b>matchboxes).</b> In the Klaipėda Region, these men were met by some 300 local volunteers, though Lithuanian historian Vygandas Vareikis disputed the accuracy of this assertion. More local men joined once the rebels reached cities. The rebels met little resistance, but struggled with cold winter weather, lack of transportation and basic supplies (they were not provided with food or clothes, but were given a daily allowance of 4000 German marks).|$|E
500|$|The {{striking}} {{form of the}} New South Wales waratah {{became a}} popular motif in Australian art {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century and was incorporated in art nouveau designs of the time. <b>Matchboxes,</b> paperweights and especially tins have been decorated with the flower. Arnott's often used the waratah as an alternative to their parrot logo on biscuit and cake tins from the early 1900s. Shelleys soft drinks, established in 1893 in Broken Hill, also displayed it on their label. The French artist Lucien Henry, who had settled in Sydney in 1879, was a strong proponent of a definitive Australian art style incorporating local flora, particularly the waratah. [...] His most famous surviving work is a triptych stained glass window of Oceania flanked by numerous waratahs overlooking the Centennial Hall in Sydney Town Hall.|$|E
2500|$|The spiders {{are usually}} caught in trees and bushes {{in the early}} morning or during dusk when the spiders come out to spin webs. After capture or {{in-between}} fights, the spiders are stabled in used <b>matchboxes.</b> These <b>matchboxes</b> usually have separate cells to house several spiders. The cells are normally made from discarded cardboard or a single blade of coconut leaf bent several times inside the matchbox. Some trainers assemble a [...] "langsaranan" [...] where the spider is released to a plant enclosed by a net or a plastic bottle with tiny holes.|$|E

5000|$|The buyout by Mattel {{was greeted}} with {{considerable}} trepidation by the <b>Matchbox</b> collectors' community. The rivalry between the Hot Wheels and <b>Matchbox</b> brands {{was not only a}} battle fought by the companies; collectors of each of the brands felt strongly about the qualities of their brand of choice. For the typical <b>Matchbox</b> collector, Hot Wheels were inferior in scaling and model choice, making them less desirable. There were fears that Mattel would either impose a Hot Wheels-style philosophy on the <b>Matchbox</b> line, or actually fold the <b>Matchbox</b> line into the Hot Wheels series. Early concerns of this nature by collectors were countered by assurances from Mattel that <b>Matchbox</b> would continue to develop its own product line independently from Hot Wheels, and that it was intended that <b>Matchbox</b> represent [...] "real" [...] and traditional vehicles, while fantasy would be placed firmly in Hot Wheels territory. To demonstrate the latter commitment, some very realistic Hot Wheels Caterpillar models were actually re-branded to <b>Matchbox,</b> although that did not assuage concerns about the strength of the former assurance.|$|R

2500|$|The {{character}} of Lindsay was based partially on Lord Burghley, a significant {{figure in the}} history of British athletics. Although Burghley did attend Cambridge, he was not a contemporary of Harold Abrahams, as Abrahams was an undergraduate from 1919 to 1923 and Burghley was at Cambridge from 1923 to 1927. One scene in the film depicts the Burghley-based [...] "Lindsay" [...] as practising hurdles on his estate with full champagne glasses placed on each hurdle – this was something the wealthy Burghley did, although he used <b>matchboxes</b> instead of champagne glasses. The fictional {{character of}} Lindsay was created when Douglas Lowe, who was Britain's third athletics gold medallist in the 1924 Olympics, was not willing to be involved with the film.|$|E
2500|$|Later, {{similar to}} how Corgis became Milton Toys and <b>Matchboxes</b> became Maxwells in India, Dinkys {{eventually}} appeared there under a distinct name. In 1963, Meccano closed its Speke factory {{and sold the}} dies, the casting machines and remains of spare parts and yellow boxes to [...] S. Kumar & Co. in Calcutta, India. Toys were marketed as Atamco Ltd. products. The toys were first assembled with parts made in Liverpool and packed in original yellow boxes with the Dinky Toys name. The quality was very poor and {{it is believed that}} Meccano Ltd. asked S. Kumar & Co. not to use the Dinky name. Kumar then applied stickers with the name NICKY on the boxes to hide the name DINKY. Later when the stock of original boxes ran out, NICKY TOYS boxes of poor quality were printed in India (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia).|$|E

2500|$|Shearing the Rams {{became one}} of the most {{well-known}} and loved paintings in the history of Australian art. The picture is widely recognised from [...] "schoolbooks, calendars, jigsaw puzzles, <b>matchboxes</b> and postage stamps." [...] Parodies of the painting have been used in advertising campaigns for items such as hardware and underwear to express what one person described as [...] "promoting what it means to be Australian today". The Australian cartoonist and social commentator Michael Leunig drew a reinterpration of the painting called Ramming the shears said to be [...] "humourous (sic) and thought provoking in the questions it raises about Australian national identity". The [...] "self-consciously nationalist" [...] image of young white men has been appropriated by other artists on behalf of several excluded groups, including women and immigrants. Nyoongar artist Dianne Jones made an Indigenous claim for inclusion by inserting her father and cousin into the iconic painting.|$|E
60|$|An {{hour later}} the party broke up. They used oil-lamps at Appleyard, {{and at night}} a row of candles in old-fashioned brass holders were placed upon a table on the bedroom landing. As a rule, a few <b>matchboxes</b> were put beside them; but {{sometimes}} this was overlooked.|$|E
60|$|For {{the making}} of match-boxes and the {{sticking}} on of the labels the pay is 2-1/2d. per gross. Few of us, I think, would care to manufacture 144 <b>matchboxes</b> for 2-1/2d.

60|$|I {{return with}} much {{appreciation}} the vivid pages on Pater. They fill up substantially the void of one's ignorance {{of his personal}} history, and they are of a manner graceful and luminous; though I should perhaps have relished a little more insistence on--a little more of an inside view of--the nature of his mind itself. Much as they tell, however, how curiously negative and faintly-grey he, after all telling, remains! I think he has had--will have had--the most exquisite literary fortune: i.e. to have taken it out all, wholly, exclusively, with the pen (the style, the genius,) and absolutely not at all with the person. He is the mask without the face, and there isn't in his total superficies a tiny point of vantage for the newspaper to flap his wings on. You have been lively about him--but about whom wouldn't you be lively? I think you'd be lively about me!--Well, faint, pale, embarrassed, exquisite Pater! He reminds me, in the disturbed midnight of our actual literature, {{of one of those}} lucent <b>matchboxes</b> which you place, on going to bed, near the candle, to show you, in the darkness, where you can strike a light: he shines in the uneasy gloom--vaguely, and has a phosphorescence, not a flame. But I quite agree with you that he is not of the little day--but of the longer time.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not think}} that Venetian {{servants}} are, as a class, given to pilfering; but knowing ourselves subject by nature to pillage, we cannot repress a feeling of gratitude to G. that she does not prey upon us. She strictly accounts for all money given her at the close of each week, and to this end keeps a kind of account-book, which I cannot help regarding as in some sort an inspired volume, being privy to the fact, confirmed by her own confession, that G. is not good for reading and writing. On settling with her I have been permitted to look into this book, which is all in capital letters,--each the evident result of serious labor,--with figures representing combinations of the pot-hook according to bold and original conceptions. The spelling is also a remarkable effort of creative genius. The only difficulty under which the author labors in regard to the book is the confusion naturally resulting from the effort to get literature right side up when it has got upside down. The writing is a kind of pugilism-- the strokes being made straight out from the shoulder. The account-book is always carried about with her in a fathomless pocket overflowing with the aggregations of a housekeeper who can throw nothing away, to wit: <b>matchboxes,</b> now appointed to hold buttons and hooks-and-eyes; beeswax in the lump; the door-key (which in Venice takes a formidable size, and impresses you at first sight as ordnance); a patch-bag; a porte-monnaie; many lead-pencils in the stump; scissors, pincushions, and the Beata Vergine in a frame. Indeed, this incapability of throwing things away is made to bear rather severely upon us in some things, such as the continual reappearance of familiar dishes at table--particularly veteran bifsteca. But we fancy that the same frugal instinct is exercised to our advantage and comfort in other things, for G. makes a great show and merit of denying our charity to those bold and adventurous children of sorrow, who do not scruple to ring your door-bell, and demand alms. It is true that with G., as with every Italian, almsgiving enters into the theory and practice of Christian life, but she will not suffer misery to abuse its privileges. She has no hesitation, however, in bringing certain objects of compassion to our notice, and she procures small services to be done for us by many lame and halt of her acquaintance. Having bought my boat (I come, in time, to be willing to sell it again for half its cost to me), I require a menial to clean it now and then, and Giovanna first calls me a youthful Gobbo for the work,--a festive hunchback, a bright-hearted whistler of comic opera. Whether this blithe humor is not considered decent, I do not know, but though the Gobbo serves me faithfully, I find him one day replaced by a venerable old man, whom--from his personal resemblance to Time--I should think much better occupied with an hourglass, or engaged with a scythe in mowing me and other mortals down, than in cleaning my boat. But all day long he sits on my riva in the sun, when it shines, gazing fixedly at my boat; and when the day is dark, he lurks about the street, accessible to my slightest boating impulse. He salutes my going out and coming in with grave reverence, and I think he has no work to do but that which G.'s wise compassion has given him from me. Suddenly, like the Gobbo, the Veccio also disappears, and I hear vaguely--for in Venice you never know any thing with precision--that he has found a regular employment in Padua, and again that he is dead. While he lasts, G. has a pleasant, even a sportive manner with this poor old man, calculated to cheer his declining years; but, as I say, cases of insolent and aggressive misery fail to touch her. The kind of wretchedness that comes breathing woe and sciampagnin [Footnote: Little champagne,--the name which the Venetian populace gave to a fierce and deadly kind of brandy drunk during the scarcity of wine. After the introduction of coal-oil this liquor came to be jocosely known as petrolio.] under our window, and there spends a leisure hour in the rehearsal of distress, establishes no claim either upon her pity or her weakness. She is deaf to the voice of that sorrow, and the monotonous whine of that dolor cannot move her to the purchase of a guilty tranquillity. I imagine, however, that she is afraid to deny charity to the fat Capuchin friar in spectacles and bare feet, who comes twice a month to levy contributions of bread and fuel for his convent, for we hear her declare from the window that the master is not at home, whenever the good brother rings; and at last, as this excuse gives out, she ceases to respond to his ring at all.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{organized}} <b>Matchbox</b> collectors' clubs (see below, [...] "Matchbox collectors"), models and their variations have been coded and catalogued, and values have been roughly established. The major collectors' organizations (NAMC, AIM, <b>Matchbox</b> USA, MICA, MBXForum etc.) {{as well as individual}} authors have published numerous works describing the various <b>Matchbox</b> ranges including the models and their variations.

5000|$|In the 1970s, adult {{collectors}} {{began to}} form semi-official clubs to discuss collecting {{at a higher}} level of sophistication. Variations were discussed and catalogued, swap meets organized, and new journals or bulletins began to appear, written by and for the serious collector. Not unlike stamps or coins, prices for older and/or more collectable models began to spiral upwards in a trend that continues. Collecting is, however, not limited to the models themselves. Anything related to <b>Matchbox</b> ― catalogues, dealer display cases, promotional literature, etc. ― is also collected. In the US, two competing clubs were both established in Massachusetts (NAMC, the National Association of <b>Matchbox</b> Collectors, run by Bob Brennan, and AIM, the American-International <b>Matchbox</b> club, run by Harold Colpitts). These clubs were the central force of <b>Matchbox</b> collecting in US during the 1970s and 1980s (though both have since ceased to exist), and from them, further spin-offs were formed, including UK <b>Matchbox</b> (run by Ray Bush), MICA (<b>Matchbox</b> International Collectors Association) and <b>Matchbox</b> USA (run by Charlie Mack), the latter of which are still in operation. Charlies Mack, as well as others, have also published books for collectors showing models, their variations and giving value/price guidance.
