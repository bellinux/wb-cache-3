5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to <b>me</b> <b>why.</b> It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E

500|$|I mean, don't you {{sometimes}} stop and go, don't you feel hyper aware {{of who you}} are in the moment? And then think, 'God, I'm me inhabiting my flesh and bones, saying my words, breathing the air that I breathe but you're also outside of it and thinking, 'But why? Why am I <b>me?</b> <b>Why...</b> why... what is my place here?' [...] Well, that happens to me all the time.|$|E
500|$|Aratus of Sicyon, the strategos of the Achaean League, {{tried to}} re-take Tegea and Orchomenus {{in a night}} attack. Efforts from inside the city failed, though, and Aratus quietly retreated, hoping to remain unnoticed. Cleomenes {{nonetheless}} discovered the plan and {{sent a message to}} Aratus asking about the goal of his expedition. Aratus replied that he had come to stop Cleomenes from fortifying Belbina. Cleomenes responded to this by saying: [...] "If it's all the same to you, write and tell <b>me</b> <b>why</b> you brought along those torches and ladders." ...|$|E

[...] He also said, [...] "It mystifies <b>me</b> <b>why</b> MI6 gave the list credibility. If they were really worried about the safety of their agents they could have denied it." [...] After The Sun {{newspaper}} called Tomlinson a [...] "traitor" [...] and published his email address, he received death threats, and fearing for his life, went into hiding for a time. Government officials later conceded that the list did not originate from Tomlinson.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a more mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris criticized both Scully {{becoming}} the believer {{as well as}} the [...] "sky turning out to be a helicopter gimmick", which she notes [...] "has gotten way too old." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations wrote a relatively negative review of the episode. He noted, [...] "All [...] did was remind <b>me</b> <b>why</b> the show is a hollow shell of what it once was as long as Fox Mulder is strapped to an alien table and why The Doggett and Pony Show holds absolutely no appeal to me whatsoever." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lord Tell Me Why" [...] is {{a gospel}} song with a rolling funk groove, sung from the {{perspective}} of a lower class White man who has become disillusioned with the American dream. His ironic lyrics ask in the chorus, [...] "Lord tell <b>me</b> <b>why</b> a white man / Ain't worth nothin' in this world no more." [...] The guitar-based [...] "I Want My Crown" [...] was recorded with an 11-piece band and has an aggressive blues style, rumba-rock groove, and growling vocals. The song is an indictment of politicians as [...] "Judas men" [...] who sided with oil barons and Republicans, and their greed that leads to war. [...] "I Want My Crown" [...] has been described by one writer as a [...] "Mephistopheles-as-Right-winger character study".|$|E

[...] Having already headed a working group on the future of rallying, Mouton was appointed FIA's manager in the World Rally Championship in 2011. Mouton also serves in the nomination committee of the Rally Hall of Fame. In March 2012, she recused herself after becoming a candidate for nomination.

500|$|Morrissey had {{specific}} {{instructions on how}} he wanted the [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] single to be packaged. He told Rough Trade's art department that the single should have a paper label centre with four vents encircling the middle, in homage to singles from the 1960s. The cover to the single features a photograph of George O'Mara by Jim French, taken from Margaret Walters' history The Nude Male. The sleeve's homoerotic undertones elicited the reaction Morrissey was hoping for of unease and outrage. Rourke said when he showed the recording to his parents his father was [...] "mortified. He said to me, 'that's a bloke's bum' and I said, 'yeah' but when he asked <b>me</b> <b>why</b> I just didn't {{have an answer for}} him".|$|E
500|$|Another {{theme is}} {{creation}} {{and the question}} of [...] "Who Am I? Who Made <b>Me?</b> <b>Why</b> Hast Thou Forsaken Me?" [...] Development of the in-universe mythology explored the Judeo-Christian creation of man, but Scott was interested in Greco-Roman and Aztec creation myths about gods who create man in their own image by sacrificing a piece of themselves. This creation is shown in the film's opening in which an Engineer sacrifices itself after consuming the dark liquid, acting as a [...] "gardener in space" [...] to bring life to a world. One of their expeditions creates humanity, who create artificial life (David) in their own image. David then introduces the dark liquid to Holloway who impregnates a sterile Shaw, and the resulting child impregnates an Engineer, creating the child of all three generations. Scott likened the Engineers to the dark angels of John Milton's Paradise Lost, and said that humanity was their offspring and not God's.|$|E
500|$|In a {{contribution}} for The Washington Post, Desson Howe said [...] "there's a wonderful, unhurried delicacy about Persuasion...as if everyone {{concerned with the}} production knows that, if given time and patience, Austen's genius will emerge. Thanks to assured performances, exacting direction and, of course, inspired writing, it does, in subtle, glorious ways". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker graded the film with an [...] "A–", saying it [...] "should enthral even those who haven't read" [...] the novel. Tucker concluded that the film was [...] "the sort of passionate yet precise comedy that reminds <b>me</b> <b>why</b> Austen remains such a vital writer". Susan Ostrov Weisser, a professor of nineteenth-century literature, called the film a [...] "faithful parade of Austen's world", and praised Root as the film's [...] "crown jewel" [...] for playing a [...] "fiercely intelligent, regretful, and frustrated Anne Elliot with subtlety and nuance". In 2008, James Rampton of The Independent rated it the fourth best Austen adaptation of all time.|$|E

500|$|Laurence Olivier {{was paid}} $1 million to play General Douglas MacArthur in the film. He was {{contracted}} {{for six weeks}} of filming, and received a payment of $250,000 upon signing the contract and the remainder was given in four subsequent installments. His salary came out to $50,000 per day. In addition to this fee, Olivier also received $2,500 per week for his expenses. Olivier was interviewed during the film's production and explained why he agreed {{to be part of}} its cast: [...] "People ask <b>me</b> <b>why</b> I'm playing in this picture. The answer is simple. Money, dear boy. I'm like a vintage wine. You have to drink me quickly before I turn sour. I'm almost used up now and I can feel the end coming. That's why I'm taking money now. I've got nothing to leave my family but the money I can make from films. Nothing is beneath me if it pays well. I've earned the right to damn well grab whatever I can in the time I've got left." ...|$|E
500|$|A pop, soul, {{and jazz}} song with {{influence}} from European and British music, The Blow Monkeys discuss the hatred and criticism {{of individuals who}} {{have been diagnosed with}} HIV/AIDS. Tommy Marx from PopMatters claimed that the intrigue and hatred behind the single prompted its success in becoming [...] "a major hit". Dr. Robert, the singer of [...] "Digging Your Scene", additionally sings about life as a homosexual, where he worries, [...] "Tell <b>me</b> <b>why</b> I'm digging your scene / I know I'll die, baby"; Barry Walters from Spin would later compare the lyrical themes on The Blow Monkeys' third studio album album, She Was Only a Grocer's Daughter (1987), to [...] "Digging Your Scene". He wrote, [...] "Dr. Robert loves camp, so it's difficult to determine if he's bi or just British." [...] Writer Colin Larkin thought similarly, stating in his book The Encyclopedia of Popular Music that [...] "Digging Your Scene" [...] was [...] "one of the earliest songs about AIDS". Music researcher Michael Anderson agreed, declaring the [...] "backlash" [...] would [...] "court controversy".|$|E
500|$|Sheila gives Berger {{a yellow}} shirt. He goofs around {{and ends up}} tearing it in two. [...] Sheila voices her {{distress}} that Berger seems to care more about the [...] "bleeding crowd" [...] than about her ("Easy to Be Hard"). [...] Jeanie summarizes everyone's romantic entanglements: [...] "I'm hung up on Claude, Sheila's hung up on Berger, Berger is hung up everywhere. Claude is hung up on a cross over Sheila and Berger." [...] The tribe runs out to the audience with fliers inviting them to a Be-In. [...] Berger, Woof and another tribe member pay satiric tribute to the American flag as they fold it ("Don't Put it Down"). [...] After young and innocent Crissy describes [...] "Frank Mills", a boy she's looking for, the tribe participates in the [...] "Be-In". [...] The men of the tribe burn their draft cards. [...] Claude puts his card in the fire, then changes his mind and pulls it out. [...] He asks, [...] "where is the something, where is the someone, that tells <b>me</b> <b>why</b> I live and die?" [...] ("Where Do I Go"). [...] The tribe emerges naked, intoning [...] "beads, flowers, freedom, happiness." ...|$|E

500|$|Agnew's first {{marriage}} was to Beverley in 1983; it {{ended in divorce}} in 1992, a year after he became BBC cricket correspondent. He has written about the role that cricket played {{in the collapse of}} the relationship, comparing his circumstances with those of then England batsman Graham Thorpe. He also found that his job interfered with his relationship with his children: I had two young children, aged seven and five... it was quickly evident that for me to have custody of my daughters – or even to form a relationship with them – was made impossible by my job. What chance do you have when, be it playing Test cricket or commentating on it, you are away {{for months at a time}} each and every winter?... There was one occasion when I did not recognise my eldest, Jennifer, when I returned from one tour... my children continue to ask <b>me</b> <b>why</b> I did not resign and take a job that would have kept me in the country and allowed me to see them more often. I find that one especially hard to answer." [...] Agnew has subsequently remarried: he met Emma Agnew, current editor of BBC East Midlands Today, when they worked together on BBC Radio Leicestershire.|$|E
500|$|Miguel held a {{press conference}} at the Las Ventas {{building}} in Madrid, Spain on the album's launch date of 13 September 1999. Miguel confirmed that it was the first album where he was more involved in the tracks' composition. [...] "Here something special was done, probably because I had more time to write a few things," [...] he added. When asked why he opted not to record an English-language album as other Latin acts such as Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin had successfully done, Miguel replied: [...] "I think that Spanish is a good language. I like my language and I really feel proud of it. I'm not saying that I won't do it in the future, sing in English, I mean. But it's just that it's not the right time for <b>me.</b> <b>Why</b> should I do it, just because everybody else is doing it?" [...] He was also asked about the lack of a duet with his then-girlfriend Mariah Carey to which he responded that he does not like to involve his personal life with his career. However, Miguel noted that the music he performs is based on his feelings at the time, and hinted the album's title was influenced by his relationship with Carey.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, the Cure {{released}} The Top, {{a generally}} psychedelic album on which Smith played all the instruments except the drums—played by Andy Anderson—and the saxophone—played by returnee Porl Thompson. The album was a Top 10 {{hit in the}} UK, and was their first studio album to break the Billboard 200 in the US, reaching number 180. Billboard |website=Billboard |accessdate=26 June 2013}} Melody Maker praised the album as [...] "psychedelia that can't be dated", while pondering, [...] "I've yet to meet anyone who can tell <b>me</b> <b>why</b> the Cure are having hits now of all times." [...] The Cure then embarked on their worldwide Top Tour with Thompson, Anderson and producer-turned-bassist Phil Thornalley on board. Released in late 1984, the Cure's first live album, Concert consisted of performances from this tour. Near the tour's end, Anderson was fired for destroying a hotel room {{and was replaced by}} Boris Williams. Thornalley also left because of the stress of touring. However, the bassist slot was not vacant long, for a Cure roadie named Gary Biddles had brokered a reunion between Smith and former bassist Simon Gallup, who had been playing in the band Fools Dance. Soon after reconciling, Smith asked Gallup to rejoin the band. Smith was ecstatic about Gallup's return and declared to Melody Maker, [...] "It's a group again." ...|$|E
