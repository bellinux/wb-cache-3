5|$|Prior to the game, Maryland {{head coach}} Ralph Friedgen placed a partial-game {{suspension}} on seven players who violated the team's pre-bowl curfew, including leading rusher, Da'Rel Scott, and senior wide receiver Danny Oquendo. Consequently, a <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> line-up initially started for Maryland {{during the early}} part of the game, including, according to Friedgen, some who probably would not have seen playing time otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The oldest mayfly {{inclusion}} in amber is Cretoneta zherichini (Leptophlebiidae) from the Lower Cretaceous of Siberia. In the <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> Baltic amber numerous inclusions of several modern families of mayflies {{have been found}} (Ephemeridae, Potamanthidae, Leptophlebiidae, Ametropodidae, Siphlonuridae, Isonychiidae, Heptageniidae, and Ephemerellidae). The modern genus Neoephemera is represented in the fossil record by the Ypresian species N.antiqua from Washington State.|$|E

5|$|Edward the Martyr (Old English: Eadweard; 18 March 978) was King of England from 975 {{until he}} was murdered in 978. Edward was the eldest son of King Edgar the Peaceful but was not his father's {{acknowledged}} heir. On Edgar's death, the leadership of England was contested, with some supporting Edward's claim to be king and others supporting his <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> half-brother Æthelred the Unready, recognized as a legitimate son of Edgar. Edward was chosen as king and was crowned by his main clerical supporters, the archbishops Dunstan and Oswald of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} years, the {{original}} Piagetian object permanence account {{has been challenged}} {{by a series of}} infant studies suggesting that <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> infants do have a clear sense that objects exist even when out of sight. Bower showed object permanence in 3-month-olds. This goes against Piaget's coordination of secondary circular reactions stage because infants aren't supposed to understand that a completely hidden object still exists until they are eight to twelve months old. The two studies below demonstrate this idea.|$|E
5|$|In {{the northwestern}} and northeastern {{parts of the}} shield volcano, basanite lava flows were erupted and are volumetrically subordinate. These {{represent}} the youngest known lavas of the Itcha Range. However, a cinder cone {{in the middle of}} the shield could be <b>much</b> <b>younger,</b> perhaps as young as the basanites at Nazko Cone to the east, which were erupted 340,000to 7,100years ago. The older basanites in the Itcha Range may have been erupted contemporaneously with the late feldspar hawaiites.|$|E

5|$|On 1 April 1668, Lady Mainwaring died, and on 3 November {{the same}} year Ashmole married Elizabeth Dugdale (1632–1701), the <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> {{daughter}} of his friend and fellow herald, the antiquarian Sir William Dugdale. All of Elizabeth's pregnancies ended in stillbirths or miscarriages, and Ashmole remained childless. In 1675, he resigned as Windsor Herald, perhaps because of factional strife within the College of Arms. He was offered the post of Garter Principal King of Arms, which traditionally came with a knighthood, but he turned it down in favour of Dugdale.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the rocks}} in which Carnotaurus was found were {{assigned}} to {{the upper part of the}} Gorro Frigio Formation, which was considered to be approximately 100 million years old (Albian or Cenomanian stage). Later they were realized to pertain to the <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> La Colonia Formation, dating 72 to 69.9 million years ago (Late Cretaceous, Lower Maastrichtian stage). Thus, Carnotaurus was the latest South American abelisaurid known. By the Late Cretaceous, South America was already isolated from both Africa and North America.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} game, Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen placed partial-game {{suspensions}} on seven players who violated the team's pre-bowl curfew. The suspended players were linebackers Moise Fokou, Trey Covington, Antwine Perez, and Derek Drummond, cornerback Jamari McCollough, the quarterback's preferred third-down wide receiver Danny Oquendo, and leading running back Da'Rel Scott. All except Drummond were regular starters. Consequently, a <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> line-up started for Maryland, including, according to Friedgen, some who {{probably would not}} have seen playing time otherwise.|$|E

The gap in the sedimentary record, called an Angular unconformity, represents about 70 million years of non-deposition and/or erosion.|$|E
5|$|Tracy's first post-MGM {{appearance}} was in The Mountain (1956) with Robert Wagner, who played his <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> brother (Wagner had earlier played {{his son in}} Broken Lance). The location filming in the French Alps proved a difficult experience, and he threatened to leave the project. His performance earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Foreign Actor. Tracy and Hepburn then paired together for the eighth time in the office-based comedy Desk Set (1957). He again had to be convinced {{to stay with the}} film which met with a weak response.|$|E
5|$|William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, who was prime {{minister}} when Victoria {{came to the}} throne and a political mentor to the young queen, was forty years her senior, but is portrayed as a <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> man in the film. As for King Leopold, he was her favourite uncle whose advice she constantly sought; her interest in Albert was due not to the latter's success in wooing her, but simply to please Leopold.|$|E

The older of two sisters, Connie Bangs (Michelle Joyner) takes her sister Sara—who is clearly <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> than she is—to her bedroom and locks her in, warning her not to let her father inside. Connie runs out of the house, fighting off her father, and is later found wandering the streets confused. She is taken to clinical social worker Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher), and admits that her father has been sexually abusing her for years.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{observations}} of certain globular clusters appeared to indicate, {{that they were}} about 15billion years old, which conflicted with most then-current estimates {{of the age of}} the universe (and indeed with the age measured today). This issue was later resolved when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds, indicated a <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> age for globular clusters. While there still remain some questions as to how accurately the ages of the clusters are measured, globular clusters are of interest to cosmology as some of the oldest objects in the universe.|$|E
5|$|Joel (Troy Baker) is {{the protagonist}} of The Last of Us. Originally from Texas, Joel was a single father in his late 20s when the initial Cordyceps {{outbreak}} occurred. Fleeing with his brother Tommy and his twelve-year-old daughter Sarah, they got involved in a firefight with a soldier, and Sarah was mortally wounded and died in his arms, leaving him traumatized. In the 20 years that follow, Joel did whatever {{he had to do}} to survive. In the time spent in the brutal post-apocalyptic world, still bitter from his daughter's death, Joel became a hardened survivor, physically and mentally tough. He has a brutal fighting style and is capable of taking on and defeating <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> men in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
