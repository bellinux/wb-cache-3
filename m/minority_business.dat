(ruling Richmond's MBE set asides unconstitutional), most states that had procurement laws for <b>minority</b> <b>business</b> (MBE) {{found that their}} laws were also unconstitutional.

25|$|After serving {{five years}} in the Maryland General Assembly, Anderson was elected {{chairman}} of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland. As chairman he sponsored and saw passed Maryland's <b>Minority</b> <b>Business</b> Enterprise Act. One of the benefits of this act for <b>minority</b> <b>business</b> was increased participation in major state projects like the building of Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Nearly 20% of the contracts let for the construction of the new ballpark went to minority owned businesses. After 12 years in the House, Anderson ran for the Senate in 1994 but was defeated in the Democratic primary. He practiced law for the next 8 years. In 2002, he made a run for the House of Delegates. As before he was a non-incumbent running against four incumbents for three seats. Unlike his first race in 1982 where he beat all the incumbents and finished first, this time Anderson finished third with a razor-thin 100-vote margin of victory over 4th-place finisher incumbent Ken Montague. In the 2006 general election campaign, Anderson joined with 43rd district incumbents Senator Joan Carter Conway, and Delegates Maggie McIntosh and Ann Marie Doory to defeat a field of 6 other challengers.|$|E

Following consultations with MENA organizations, the Census Bureau announced in 2014 that it would establish a new MENA ethnic category for populations from the Middle East, North Africa and the Arab world, separate from the [...] "white" [...] classification that these populations had previously sought in 1909. The expert groups, including some Jewish organizations, felt that the earlier [...] "white" [...] designation no longer accurately represents MENA identity, so they successfully lobbied for a distinct categorization.

40|$|Objectives: Our paper {{contributes}} {{to understanding the}} dynamics of ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>businesses</b> in the UK by bringing to the fore {{a variety of factors}} inhibiting the entrepreneurial activity of these groups, and in doing so provides insights into the empowering and mobilizing factors of minority entrepreneurship. It aims uncover the factors that may explain their entrepreneurial propensity, and the success or failure factors of their entrepreneurial activities Prior Work: Given the diverse features of <b>minority</b> <b>businesses</b> and their economic importance (both potential and actual), surprisingly {{little is known about the}} entrepreneurial activity of people from refugee backgrounds. Understanding the different dynamics of this dimension of entrepreneurship is important because refugees are distinct from – and often lack access to ethnic resources generated within – well-established ethnic minority groups (Waldinger, 1990; Flap et al., 2002). The current research explores this theme and {{contributes to}} the existing literature by focusing on the entrepreneurial activity of Eritreans from refugee backgrounds in the UK. Approach: The paper utilizes the mainstream literature on ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>businesses</b> and conceptualizes a framework (motivated by research gaps) that draws from political, economic, cultural and social (and human) capital theories to explore the pre- and post-entrepreneurial start-up factors of Eritrean refugee entrepreneurs. Justified in terms of (1) methodological precedence in the study of ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>businesses,</b> and (2) the logic of qualitative fit for a phenomenon where there is limited literature, our research employs the interpretive phenomenological approach, utilizing a grounded theory strategy for theory building. Results: The results indicate that entrepreneurs demonstrate strong ethnically driven behavior in their business activity, which points towards the centrality of ethnicity features in the entrepreneurial dynamics of Eritrean refugees in the UK. In consequence, these entrepreneurs often depend on financial and knowledge support from family members and Eritrean contacts in their pre- and post-start up process. Another major insight that emerged from this research relates to the influence of political factor in terms of obstacles and discrimination experienced from both regulatory bodies and the UK community at large. Implications and Value: Based on the overall evidence, the paper suggests that social, human, and financial capital – as well as the degree to which cultural values are accepted, the level of proficiency in English language, and the risk-taking propensity of Eritrean refugees entrepreneurship – are the decisive factors of Eritrean refugee Entrepreneurship and that they may inform the wider reflection on the dynamics of ethnic minority entrepreneurship...|$|R
