5|$|Throughout the Seven Days Battles, Lee's {{forces had}} been {{separated}} and scattered due to swamps, narrow roads and other geographic obstacles, and occasionally due to unclear orders. As {{the days of}} marching and fighting wore {{on the number of}} stragglers swelled to fill narrow roads and significantly deplete the Confederate ranks, presenting a significant additional strain on their combat readiness. These hindrances continued during the Battle of Malvern Hill, with both Magruder and Huger <b>making</b> <b>mistakes</b> in the deployment of their forces.|$|E
5|$|The story starts {{eight months}} after the murder of Tracy Bond, which {{occurred}} {{at the end of the}} previous novel, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. James Bond is drinking and gambling heavily and <b>making</b> <b>mistakes</b> on his assignments when, as a last resort, he is sent to Japan on a semi-diplomatic mission. Whilst there he is challenged by the Head of the Japanese Secret Service to kill Dr. Guntram Shatterhand. Bond realises that Shatterhand is Ernst Stavro Blofeld and sets out on a revenge mission to kill him and his wife, Irma Bunt.|$|E
5|$|Patton did not {{command a}} force in combat for 11 months. In September, Bradley, who was Patton's junior in both rank and experience, was {{selected}} to command the First United States Army forming in England to prepare for Operation Overlord. This decision had been made before the slapping incidents were made public, but Patton blamed them for his being denied the command. Eisenhower felt the invasion of Europe was too important to risk any uncertainty, and that the slapping incidents had been an example of Patton's inability to exercise discipline and self-control. While Eisenhower and Marshall both considered Patton to be a skilled combat commander, they felt Bradley was less impulsive or prone to <b>making</b> <b>mistakes.</b> On January 26, 1944 Patton was formally given command of the Third United States Army in England, a newly arrived unit, and assigned to prepare its inexperienced soldiers for combat in Europe. This duty kept Patton busy in early 1944 preparing for the pending invasion.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 {{film was}} also tied into the books. A novelization {{of the movie}} was written {{to look like the}} older books. Two books were also written for the Girl Detective and Clue Crew series that deal with a mystery on a movie set. In 2008, the Girl Detective series was re-branded into trilogies and to have a model on the cover. The mysteries became deeper, with Nancy often <b>making</b> <b>mistakes.</b> These trilogies were also met with {{negative}} fan reception due to Nancy's constant mistakes, shortness of the books, and lack of action. With the new trilogy format, sales began slipping. Simon & Schuster then cut back from six to four books per year. In December 2011, they finally announced that the series was cancelled along with the Hardy Boys Undercover Brothers series.|$|E

25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words than lexical measures, so hence consume more research instrument space and more respondent time to complete. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Often forget to put things back in their proper place, or Am careful to avoid <b>making</b> <b>mistakes.</b> Some statement-based measures of conscientiousness have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, but their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For instance, statements in colloquial North American English like Often forget to put things back in their proper place or Am careful to avoid <b>making</b> <b>mistakes</b> can be hard for non-native English-speakers to understand, suggesting internationally validated measures might be more appropriate for research conducted with non-North Americans.|$|E

25|$|It's been {{suggested}} that during his career Faldo wore down the opposition and benefited from other players <b>making</b> <b>mistakes</b> in pressure-filled situations. His three Masters titles at Augusta came after mistakes by Scott Hoch missing a short putt in 1989, Raymond Floyd hitting an approach shot into a pond in 1990 and from a collapse by Greg Norman {{in the final round}} in 1996. Two of Faldo's Open Championship wins came after mistakes in the closing two holes by Paul Azinger in 1987 and John Cook in 1992. Nevertheless, Faldo earns credit for the way in which he performed under pressure in his major victories.|$|E

25|$|Task Review: Alpha wisely {{spent their}} time {{sourcing}} items before setting off, but had initial difficulties {{when they arrived}} at the market. However, they managed to collect all ten items without penalties, with Helene and Raef bargaining well for the cow hide and obtaining a second-hand Santos orange juicer in the last few minutes, despite buying it for a fair price. Meanwhile, Renaissance's execution of the task was a shambles, as Jennifer paid little attention to the dossiers, deciding to straight to the market and thus resulting in the team being disorganised and <b>making</b> <b>mistakes,</b> such as buying the wrong colour of mosque alarm clock, while Jenny and Michael attempted to bribe a sports store so to sabotage Alpha's efforts. The team effectively lost the task due to a combination of these mistakes, and the fines they received for purchasing unbranded tajines and a halal chicken instead of a kosher chicken.|$|E

25|$|In Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, wolf {{flesh was}} a main {{ingredient}} in unguents used {{to ward off}} evil. When applied {{in the form of}} a powder, the wolf unguent would be used to cure epilepsy, plague and gout. Powdered wolf bones were used to cure chest and back pains, broken bones and strained tendons. Wolf teeth, particularly the canines, would be perforated and used as talismans against evil spirits. This practice is thought to fall back to the Paleolithic, as shown by some prehistoric grave sites showing numerous wolf tooth charms. It continues in some areas of rural France, where it is also thought that wearing a wolf tooth offers protection from wolf attacks. The tongue, when cooked with flour and honey, was traditionally used as a remedy for epilepsy and as a guarantee of good luck. The eyes of a wolf were traditionally thought to give courage to children and render the user partially invisible. The liver was particularly prized for medicinal and ritualistic purposes. When cooked or desiccated into a powder and mixed with certain ingredients (flour, wine, water, blood, urine etc.), wolf liver was said to cure epilepsy, edema, tachycardia, syphilis, gangrene, vertigo, migraines, verucas and dysentery. Wolf penis supposedly cured impotence. Wolf blood was used for gout, period pains and deafness. The paws and fat of a wolf were sometimes used to ward off evil, or facilitate the transformation of a werewolf. Wolf dung was used against colics. The milk of a she-wolf made the drinker invulnerable, while eating the heart of a wolf gave the consumer courage in battle. A wolf's tail, while used for warding off evil, was also used as a love charm. The head of a wolf, if hung outside a house, would deter wolves, robbers and evil spirits. When reduced to powder, a wolf's head could be used against toothache and joint pains. In the cultures of certain Native American tribes, wolf body parts were considered important additions to certain rituals. Pawnee warriors, known as Wolf People, dressed in wolf skin cloaks when scouting or hunting. Nez Perce warriors wore wolf teeth pushed through the septums of their noses. Cheyenne medicine men wrapped wolf fur on sacred arrows used to motion prey into traps. Arikara men wove wolf fur with bison fur in order to make small sacred blankets. Nuxálk mothers painted wolf gall bladders on their young male children's backs, so they could grow up to perform religious ceremonies without <b>making</b> <b>mistakes</b> as hunters. Hidatsan women experiencing difficult births would call upon the familial power of wolves by rubbing wolf-skin caps on their bellies. In Mongolian folk medicine, eating the intestines of a wolf is said to alleviate chronic indigestion, while sprinkling food with powdered wolf rectum is said to cure haemorroids. There are not many traditional uses for Ethiopian wolves, though their livers may be used for medicinal reasons in northern Ethiopia.|$|E

It is in their writings that glimpses of his character survive.

Bajkam was also solicitous for the welfare of his subjects, and especially the inhabitants of Wasit cherished his memory.|$|E
