40|$|The use {{of maximum}} length {{sequence}} (<b>m-sequence)</b> has been found beneficial for recovering both linear and nonlinear components at rapid stimulation. Since <b>m-sequence</b> is fully characterized by a primitive polynomial of different orders, the selection of polynomial order can be problematic in practice. Usually, the <b>m-sequence</b> is repetitively delivered in a looped fashion. Ensemble averaging is carried out {{as the first step}} and followed by the cross-correlation analysis to deconvolve linear/nonlinear responses. According to the classical noise reduction property based on additive noise model, theoretical equations have been derived in measuring noise attenuation ratios (NARs) after the averaging and correlation processes in the present study. A computer simulation experiment was conducted to test the derived equations, and a nonlinear deconvolution experiment was also conducted using order 7 and 9 m-sequences to address this issue with real data. Both theoretical and experimental results show that the NAR is essentially independent of the <b>m-sequence</b> order and is decided by the total length of valid data, as well as stimulation rate.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that pairs of maximal linear {{recursive}} sequences (<b>m-sequences)</b> typically have mean square aperiodic crosscorrelation {{on par with}} that of random sequences, but that if one takes a pair of <b>m-sequences</b> where one is the reverse of the other, and shifts them appropriately, one can get significantly lower mean square aperiodic crosscorrelation. Sequence pairs with even lower mean square aperiodic crosscorrelation are constructed by taking a Legendre sequence, cyclically shifting it, and then cutting it (approximately) in half and using the halves as the sequences of the pair. In some of these constructions, the mean square aperiodic crosscorrelation can be lowered further if one truncates or periodically extends (appends) the sequences. Exact asymptotic formulae for mean squared aperiodic crosscorrelation are proved for sequences derived from additive characters (including <b>m-sequences</b> and modified versions thereof) and multiplicative characters (including Legendre sequences and their relatives). Data is presented that shows that sequences of modest length have performance that closely approximates the asymptotic formulae. Comment: 54 page...|$|R
