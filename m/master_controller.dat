40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} evaluating methods of controlling a telerobot; bilateral force reflecting <b>master</b> <b>controllers</b> and proportional rate {{six degrees of}} freedom (DOF) hand controllers. The first study compared the controllers on performance of single manipulator arm tasks, a peg-in-the-hole task, and simulated satellite orbital replacement unit changeout. The second study, a Space Station truss assembly task, required simultaneous operation of both manipulator arms (all 12 DOFs) and complex multiaxis slave arm movements. Task times were significantly longer and fewer errors were committed with the hand controllers. The hand controllers were also rated significantly higher in cognitive and manual control workload on the two-arm task. The <b>master</b> <b>controllers</b> were rated significantly higher in physical workload. There {{were no significant differences in}} ratings of manipulator control quality...|$|R

Tōzai Line sets were modified with a single-handle (left-hand) system on {{transfer to the}} Tōzai Line.The Tōzai Line sets have a <b>master</b> <b>controller</b> which incorporates a deadman system which applies the brakes if the <b>master</b> <b>controller</b> is released by the driver.|$|E

Two of the windows are usually screened by curtains on the Tozai Line, but one window is left unobstructed so passengers can look the view ahead even on subway tracks.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} issues {{impacting}} the utility of telerobotic systems for space {{is the development of}} effective control strategies. For near-term applications, telerobot control is likely to utilize teleoperation methodologies with integrated supervisory control capabilities to assist the operator. Two different approaches to telerobotic control are evaluated: bilateral force reflecting <b>master</b> <b>controllers</b> and proportional rate six degrees-of-freedom hand controllers. The controllers' performance of single manipulator arm tasks is compared. Simultaneous operation of both manipulator arms and complex multiaxis slave arm movements is investigated. Task times are significantly longer and fewer errors are committed with the hand controllers. The hand controllers are also rated significantly higher in cognitive and manual control workload on the two-arm task. The <b>master</b> <b>controllers</b> are rated significantly higher in physical workload. The implications of these findings for space teleoperations and higher levels of control are discussed...|$|R
25|$|SPI {{controllers}} {{from different}} vendors support different feature sets; such DMA queues are not uncommon, {{although they may}} be associated with separate DMA engines rather than the SPI controller itself, such as used by multichannel buffered serial port (MCBSP). Most SPI <b>master</b> <b>controllers</b> integrate support for up to four chip selects, although some require chip selects to be managed separately through GPIO lines.|$|R
50|$|After refurbishment, the R32 and R32A {{cars were}} renamed R32 Phase I, R32 Phase II, and R32 GE, {{with the first}} of the three types being the only one in service today. The R32 Phase I cars (re-built by Morrison Knudsen) have WABCO Air Brake packages, GE <b>Master</b> <b>Controllers,</b> and Thermo King HVAC units. The R32 Phase II cars (also re-built by Morrison Knudsen) have NY Air Brake equipment, Westinghouse <b>Master</b> <b>Controllers,</b> and Stone Safety HVAC units. The ten R32 GEs are {{slightly}} different from the Phase I and II cars as they were rebuilt to R38 specifications (experimental Sigma HVAC Units powered by A/C motors and solid state inverters, original traction motors rebuilt to 115 horsepower instead of the traditional 100 horsepower units, backlit ad signs, and different bulkhead designs). Since the cars were sent out to be overhauled based on how poorly they were performing (worst first), there are R32s and R32As rebuilt in both Phase I and Phase II configurations. There are also about a dozen or more pairs which are composed of R32 and R32A mixes.|$|R

25|$|As mentioned, one {{variant of}} SPI uses single {{bidirectional}} data line (slave out/slave in, called SISO) {{instead of two}} unidirectional ones (MOSI and MISO). This variant is restricted to a half duplex mode. It tends {{to be used for}} lower performance parts, such as small EEPROMs used only during system startup and certain sensors, and Microwire. Few SPI <b>master</b> <b>controllers</b> support this mode; although it can often be easily bit-banged in software.|$|R

50|$|The unusual {{feature is}} that once the driver has moved the {{controller}} to 'full parallel' and the train has accelerated {{to the point where}} the switchgear is actually in full parallel, the driver can then move the <b>master</b> <b>controller</b> back to 'full series'. The traction switchgear will remain in 'full parallel' unless the driver moves the <b>master</b> <b>controller</b> from 'full series' to any position towards 'off'. Many drivers took advantage of this feature because it was more comfortable maintaining the downward pressure on the deadman's handle with the handle at the 6 o'clock position (the 'full series' position) rather than the 9 o'clock position (the 'full parallel' position).|$|E

50|$|The 1394 {{interface}} {{is comparable}} to USB though USB requires a <b>master</b> <b>controller</b> and has greater market share. IEEE 1394 replaced parallel SCSI in many applications, because of lower implementation costs and a simplified, more adaptable cabling system.|$|E

40|$|Most {{uncertainties}} of {{operation of a}} telerobot in the space environment relate {{to the absence of}} gravity effects and not to the vacuum effects. A flight experiment concept is proposed for the middeck of the space shuttle that provides direct access for the crew. Telerobot dextrous manipulation issues in task performance, mechanism response, system duty cycles, and operator interface can be effectively addressed. A pair of replica-type <b>master</b> <b>controllers</b> would be adapted for slave manipulator functions. A variety of test setups and control modes can obtain data on zero G operation of a telerobot...|$|R
50|$|Between 1988 and 1989, the R42s {{underwent}} overhaul as {{a result}} of deferred maintenance in the New York City Subway during the 1970s and the 1980s. 282 cars (4550-4839) were overhauled by Morrison-Knudsen while the last 110 cars (4840-4949) were rebuilt in-house by the Coney Island Overhaul Shop in Brooklyn. The one minor difference in appearance between the two overhauls was that many cars of the Coney Island version featured the original blue door indicator lights at the ends of the cars, whereas these lights were removed from the Morrison-Knudsen rebuilds. Coney Island cars retained original Westinghouse XM829 <b>master</b> <b>controllers</b> in their cabs.|$|R
