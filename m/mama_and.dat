500|$|Chastain next took on {{the lead}} role of a {{musician}} who is forced {{to care for her}} boyfriend's troubled nieces in the horror film Mama (2013). She was attracted to the idea of playing a woman drastically different from the [...] "perfect mother" [...] roles she had played in Take Shelter and The Tree of Life, and she based her character's look on the singer Alice Glass. The critic Richard Roeper noted how different the role was from the ones she had previously played, and considered it as proof of her being one of the best actors of her generation. During the film's opening weekend in North America, Chastain became the first performer in 15 years to have leading roles in the top two films (<b>Mama</b> <b>and</b> Zero Dark Thirty) at the box office. Mama eventually earned $146 million worldwide. She then starred as the titular character of a depressed woman who separates from her husband (played by James McAvoy) following a tragic incident in the drama The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby (2013), which she also produced. The writer-director Ned Benson initially wrote the story from the perspective of Rigby's husband, then wrote a separate version from Rigby's perspective on the insistence of Chastain. The film premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival in two parts, Him and Her. A third part told from both their perspectivessubtitled Themwas released separately. The film did not find a wide audience, but the critic A. O.
