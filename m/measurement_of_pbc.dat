In this review, the epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>PBC,</b> which {{varies in}} different countries and regions, is comprehensively introduced.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the form of}} performance-based contract which is relatively new to healthcare systems. Economic theories on contracting are reviewed to provide theoretical support for potential impacts <b>of</b> performance-based contracting (<b>PBC)</b> on improving efficiency of the healthcare system. Implementation issues <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> in healthcare practice are briefly discussed with examples in the literature reviewed. In addition, various economic incentives <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> on provider behaviour are discussed, including its primary intended incentive on improving system efficiency, as well as incentives of risk selection on patients, improved matching between providers and patients, and gaming on reporting. In summary, with a simple and economically valid idea of `rewarding good performance' behind it, PBC is a potentially powerful contracting tool that could improve accountability, introduce competition, and improve the efficiency of healthcare resource allocation. In practice, PBC has been implemented and tested in various settings. Some preliminary {{evidence suggests that the}} implementation of incentive regulation such as PBC could increase healthcare outputs including access, quantity and effectiveness as well as reduce costs of care. However, it also introduces complicated incentives on providers which makes the evaluation of the effect <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> on healthcare systems a challenging task, both theoretically and empirically. Furthermore, there are various practical issues, such as <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> performance, which remain unsolved and make the implementation <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> controversial. In the meantime, development <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> in healthcare systems should remain cautious. More research on outcome evaluation and treatment effectiveness is needed to establish the link between financial incentives and healthcare outcomes.

The study identifies how program management has been affected by the implementation <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> and describes its use in three DoD acquisition programs. The advantages, disadvantages, and risks associated with PBC are analyzed to determine potential areas for improvement of the process, and the study develops guidelines that future program managers can use in the setup <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> acquisitions. Based on key findings and conclusions, the study recommends the Government determine metrics for <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the effectiveness and efficiency <b>of</b> <b>PBC,</b> evaluate the waiver process associated with this initiative, and increase the training opportunities for the acquisition workforce.

40|$|Abstract Primary biliary {{cirrhosis}} (PBC) is a chronic, cholestatic, autoimmune {{liver disease}} characterised by {{the destruction of}} small- and medium-sized bile ducts. The serological hallmark <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> includes antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA). The disease has a striking female pre-dominance, and primarily affects women of middle-age. First-degree relatives, and in particular female relatives, {{are known to have}} an increased risk of developing the disease. Several studies have attempted to explain the female pre-dominance <b>of</b> <b>PBC,</b> and autoimmune diseases in general. Two components that are <b>of</b> interest in <b>PBC</b> include monosomy X and xenobiotics. Monosomy X has been noted to be prevalent in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> patients. Xenobiotics, which are exogenous chemicals not normally found within the body, have been implicated in the modification of, and loss of, tolerance to AMA. Several cosmetics are known to contain these xenobiotics, which is of interest given the information provided in regards to known risk factors for PBC devel-opment. This review will focus on X monosomy and xenobiotics, which appear to constitute the X-factor <b>of</b> <b>PBC...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Conditions exhibiting {{features}} {{of two different}} autoimmune liver diseases are designated overlap syndromes. Variant forms display some, but not all, characteristics of a distinct autoimmune liver disease. We describe transitions over time between variant forms <b>of</b> <b>PBC,</b> i. e. AMA-negative PBC, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) -PBC overlap and autoimmune cholangitis (AIC) in a large cohort <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> patients in Sweden. METHODS: We retrieved all patients with variant forms <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> in six university hospitals in Sweden, covering 60 % of the Swedish population. The diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> and its variants was based on laboratory findings and compatible histological features. The revised autoimmune hepatitis scoring system proposed by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group was used to establish the diagnosis of AIH. RESULTS: In a population of 800 patients with PBC, we identified 35 (5 %) variant forms; 25 patients with AIH-PBC overlap, 8 with AIC and 2 with AMA-negative PBC {{at the time of}} our study. The initial diagnoses were PBC (3 patients), AIH (3), AIH-PBC overlap (16), AIC (8) and AMA-negative PBC with (1) or without (4) concomitant AIH. The median follow-up was 125 (41 - 360) months. Immunosuppression and ursodeoxycholic acid induced a complete or good regression of increased aminotransferases in about half of the patients who were given one or both of these treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Variant forms <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> are seen in approximately 5 % <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> patients in Sweden. Transition between different forms may occur, emphasizing the value of repeat biopsies, but established overlapping AIH-PBC seems to be stable over time...|$|R

Attempts to find serological evidence of PBC-specific autoantibodies such as AMA have been made and, conversely, granulomatous livers from patients with PBC have been investigated for molecular evidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

40|$|Genetic and {{environmental}} factors have been widely suggested {{to contribute to the}} pathogenesis of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology leading to destruction of small bile ducts.

40|$|Poor {{quality data}} such as data with errors or missing values cause {{negative}} consequences in many application domains. An {{important aspect of}} data quality is completeness. One problem in data completeness {{is the problem of}} missing individuals in data sets. Within a data set, the individuals refer to the real world entities whose information is recorded. So far, in completeness studies however, there has been little discussion about how missing individuals are assessed. In this thesis, we propose the notion <b>of</b> population-based completeness (<b>PBC)</b> that deals with the missing individuals problem, with the aim of investigating what is required to measure PBC and to identify what is needed to support PBC measurements in practice. To achieve these aims, we analyse the elements <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> and the requirements for PBC measurement, resulting in a definition <b>of</b> the <b>PBC</b> elements and PBC measurement formula. We propose an architecture for PBC measurement systems and determine the technical requirements <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> systems in terms of software and hardware components. An analysis of the technical issues that arise in implementing PBC makes a contribution {{to an understanding of the}} feasibility <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> <b>measurements</b> to provide accurate measurement results. Further exploration of a particular issue that was discovered in the analysis showed that when measuring PBC across multiple databases, data from those databases need to be integrated and materialised. Unfortunately, this requirement may lead to a large internal store for the PBC system that is impractical to maintain. We propose an approach to test the hypothesis that the available storage space can be optimised by materialising only partial information from the contributing databases, while retaining accuracy <b>of</b> the <b>PBC</b> <b>measurements.</b> Our approach involves substituting some of the attributes from the contributing databases with smaller alternatives, by exploiting the approximate functional dependencies (AFDs) that can be discovered within each local database. An analysis of the space-accuracy trade-offs of the approach leads to the development of an algorithm to assess candidate alternative attributes in terms of space-saving and accuracy (<b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> <b>measurement).</b> The result <b>of</b> several case studies conducted for proxy assessment contributes to an understanding of the space-accuracy trade-offs offered by the proxies.

40|$|Recently, {{there is}} ample {{evidence}} suggesting the important role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in autoimmune diseases via modulating B cells function. Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a progressive immune-mediated liver disease with unclear pathogenic mechanism. Whether the miRNA in peripheral B cells <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> involve the mechanisms of pathology and progression is not known. The present study explores miRNA deregulation in peripheral B-cell <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> from stage I to IV and healthy controls. Peripheral B cells were obtained from 72 PBC patients (stage I, n = 17; stage II, n = 23; stage III, n = 16; stage IV, n = 16) and 15 healthy controls. Initially, in a discovery study, miRNA array analysis was performed, subsequently, in a validation study, quantitative PCR was used to investigate miRNA expression profile in B cells of PBS patients compared to healthy controls. Based on bioinformatics analysis, we identified the potential biological processes and significant signaling pathways affected by these microRNAs, and generated the microRNA-gene network. The discovery study identified 558 miRNAs differentially expressed in B cells <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> patients compared to controls.

40|$|This article {{presents}} an implementation of periodic boundary conditions (PBC) for Dislocation Dynamics (DD) simulations {{in three dimensions}} (3 D). We discuss fundamental aspects <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> development, including preservation of translational invariance and line connectivity, the choice of initial configurations compatible with PBC and a consistent treatment of image stress. On the practical side, our approach reduces to manageable proportions the computational burden of updating the long-range elastic interactions among dislocation segments. The timing data confirms feasibility and practicality <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> for large-scale DD simulations in 3 D...|$|R
40|$|Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) {{and primary}} sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) {{are the most}} {{frequent}} chronic cholestatic liver diseases and serve as model diseases to discuss the management of cholestasis in 2017 in the lecture that is summarized in this report. PBC and PSC are characterized by inflammation and fibrosis <b>of</b> small intrahepatic (<b>PBC)</b> or larger intra- and/or extrahepatic (PSC) bile ducts. Bile duct damage leads to cholestasis and can progress to liver fibrosis and even cirrhosis. Various genetic, environmental and endogenous factors {{may contribute to the}} development of chronic cholestatic liver diseases, but the exact pathogenesis <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> and PSC has not been clarified. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the standard treatment <b>of</b> <b>PBC</b> and is used also for other cholestatic conditions including PSC, and it exerts anticholestatic effects at adequate doses. Novel anticholestatic therapeutic options for patients not adequately responding to UDCA are under development or have, like obeticholic acid, already been proven to have efficacy when combined with UDCA in the treatment <b>of</b> <b>PBC.</b> The future role of immunomodulating/immunosuppressive drug regimens must be critically reviewe...|$|R
