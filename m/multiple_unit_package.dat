50|$|Queensland Rail, in {{partnership}} with TransLink, provides Urban and Interurban rail and bus services throughout South East Queensland. These rail services operate on eleven rail lines including Beenleigh, Caboolture, Cleveland, Doomben, Exhibition, Ferny Grove, Gold Coast, Gympie North, Ipswich-Rosewood, Redcliffe Peninsula, Shorncliffe, and Springfield lines. Queensland Rail provides train services on these lines with its rolling stock of electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units,</b> which includes the Electric <b>Multiple</b> <b>Units</b> (EMU), the Suburban <b>Multiple</b> <b>Units</b> (SMU), the Interurban <b>Multiple</b> <b>Units</b> (IMU) and the InterCity Express (ICE).|$|R
50|$|Previously, {{electric}} {{passenger services}} stopping at Linden were trains hauled by ED and EW class electric locomotives, and DM/D and EM/ET class electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units.</b> ED locomotives hauled passenger trains from their introduction in 1940 but were rarely seen on passenger trains after {{the introduction of}} the EW class locomotives in 1952. The last ED operated in 1981. EW class locomotives introduced in 1952 pulled the majority of passenger trains from 1952 but became redundant with the introduction of EM/ET class <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> in the early 1980s. The last EW hauled passenger service through Linden was on 11 February 1983. DM/D electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> first ran on the line on 5 September 1949, and the last of this class were withdrawn from service after the arrival of the FT/FP class (Matangi) <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> in 2011. The EM/ET class <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> were introduced between 1982 and 1983 to replace locomotive-hauled trains and some of the DM/D electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> and last operated on 27 May 2016 after additional FT/FP class (Matangi) <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> were introduced.|$|R
50|$|Diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> and railcars are trains, {{usually with}} {{passenger}} accommodation, {{that do not}} require a locomotive. Railcars can be single cars, while in <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> cars are marshalled together with a driving position either end. , 23 percent of the rail passenger cars used on Network Rail are part of an diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|R

50|$|Multiple-unit {{train control}} {{was first used}} in Electric <b>Multiple</b> <b>Units</b> in the 1890s. This allowed electrically-powered rapid transit trains to be {{operated}} from a single driving position. Early users of such <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> include the Liverpool Overhead Railway (the first <b>multiple</b> <b>units)</b> and Chicago's South Side Elevated Railroad (the first units to use a low-voltage control system).|$|R
50|$|An electro-diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> {{is a form}} of {{passenger}} rail car powered either from an electricity supply (like an electric <b>multiple</b> <b>unit)</b> or by using the onboard diesel engine (like a diesel-electric <b>multiple</b> <b>unit).</b> Examples include the Hitachi Class 800 and Class 802, as well as the trains being built by Stadler for Abellio Greater Anglia.|$|R
50|$|This {{series has}} been perpetuated, though the series have been adapted for new {{generation}} <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> stock. For instance, the latest diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> have reused the 50xxx and 79xxx series for driving motors and the 56xxx series for non-driving motors. In the electric <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> series, Class 390 Pendolinos have reused the 68xxx and 69xxx series.|$|R

The Suburban <b>Multiple</b> <b>Unit</b> is divided into in three subclasses, sets 201-212 as the 200 series, sets 221-250 as the 220 series, and sets 261-296, as the 260 series.|$|R

50|$|Commuter rail {{trains are}} usually {{composed}} of <b>multiple</b> <b>units,</b> which are self-propelled, bidirectional, articulated passenger rail cars with driving motors on each (or every other) bogie. Depending on local circumstances and tradition {{they may be}} powered either by diesel engines located below the passenger compartment (diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>units)</b> or by electricity picked up from third rails or overhead lines (electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units).</b> <b>Multiple</b> <b>units</b> are almost invariably equipped with control cabs at both ends, which is why such units are so frequently used to provide commuter services, due to the associated short turn-around time.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s declining {{passenger}} {{numbers and}} {{the high cost of}} electricity lead to the replacement of the electric <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> with diesel <b>multiple</b> <b>units.</b> The units had all been withdrawn by 17 June 1967 when electric working ceased.|$|R
