For that purpose a total of 80 East Friesian ewes, from 2 nd to 4 th lactation, with symmetrical udders, without visible (clinical) signs of mastitis were involved in this study. Until weaning at average age of 60 ± 5 days lambs suckled their mothers exclusively. During milking period regular <b>milking</b> <b>controls</b> (on a monthly basis) were carried out (AT method) and, on these occasions, individual milk samples for chemical composition analysis were taken. Three times per lactation (1 st, 3 rd and 5 th <b>milking</b> <b>control),</b> prior to the milking, evaluation and measuring of udder morphology traits were performed. Also, during above-mentioned test-day controls (three times per lactation) one sample of half udder milk was taken with purpose of bacterial and somatic cell counts (SCC) tests. Ewes with twin and triplet lambs had significantly (P 0. 05) and depth (P> 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract Glucose is {{the major}} {{precursor}} of lactose synthesis in the mammary gland.

Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbG) is a retrospective measure of mean blood glucose level and it is largely unaffected by recent physiological conditions and environmental events. The {{purposes of this study}} were to determine the correlations between lactose traits and other milk production traits in dairy cattle and to investigate whether HbG level can be correlated with milk and lactose production traits. Here, HbG percentage, milk and lactose production traits including milk yield, lactose, protein, SNF, total solid and fat percentages and yields were measured in 485 second calved Iranian Holstein cattle. Statistically significant negative correlations were established between HbG and milk yield (r=− 0. 88), lactose yield (r=− 0. 83), SNF yield (r=− 0. 81), protein yield (r=− 0. 79) and total solid yield (r=− 0. 74). Positive correlations were established between lactose yield and milk (r= 0. 96), protein (r= 0. 81), SNF (r= 0. 92) and total solid (r= 0. 79) yields. The negative correlation between HbG and milk and total lactose production is probably related to the higher glucose demands in the lactating mammary gland of more productive cows. The positive correlation between lactose yield and milk, protein, SNF and total solid yield indicates that the level of lactose synthesis influences milk production traits in ways other than merely via its osmolytic action...|$|R

Subclinical ketosis was indicated by the fat to protein ratio (F/P ratio) higher than 1. 5 in cows that yielded between 33 to 50 kg of milk per day (Eicher, 2004). The ketosis index was defined in relation to the timing of subclinical ketosis detection to the subsequent measures of test-day milk yields. The effect of subclinical ketosis on test day milk yields were studied separately for each parity using the mixed model analysis. The statistical model included the fixed effect of ketosis index, calving year-month, lactation stage and random effect of animals included in the study. The prevalence peak of subclinical ketosis occurred in the first month of lactation. Subclinical ketosis had a significant negative effect on daily milk yield.
