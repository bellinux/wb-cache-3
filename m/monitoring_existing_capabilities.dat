40|$|Identifying {{occurrences of}} failure {{is a major}} {{challenge}} in business process management. Current business monitoring techniques are invaluable tool for debugging and evaluating business process executions. In this paper a method of extending <b>existing</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the systems to allow real-time or near-real-time monitoring is discussed. The presented method draws on the existing Model Driven Development techniques to automatically create a new module called Protocol Service. The created Protocol Service is deployed with the <b>existing</b> system to <b>monitor</b> occurrences of undesirable events and failure. In this paper {{the outline of the}} approach will be presented...|$|R

SIO also was asked to recommend changes required to meet this need. A team of scientists conducted a review of <b>existing</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>capabilities</b> in San Diego, as well as examining programs elsewhere that address similar outfalls...|$|R
40|$|Interconnected {{networks}} face a broad {{variety of}} threats, some – especially when targeting valuable enterprise networks – highly specialized and sophisticated. To counter those threats, enterprise network operators rely on security equipment to monitor network traffic for anomalies that may indicate attacks or other security violations. However, as {{new kinds of}} threats emerge continuously, keeping the network’s line of defense up-to-date requires increasing amounts of both technical and human resources, as these new threats often defy <b>existing</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>capabilities.</b> In this paper, we present our approach for distributed and cooperative threat monitoring based on monitoring equipment available in corporate networks, with detection capabilities far beyond the scopes of the utilized monitoring equipment. We discuss the suitability of our approach even {{for the detection of}} fast-evolving threats and how the seamless integration into and a more efficient use of existing security infrastructures helps increasing the protection level at low operational costs...|$|R

Homecare and healthcare applications wireless, mobile networks and wireless sensors improve the <b>existing</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>capabilities</b> {{especially for the}} elderly, children, chronically ill and also for athletes. Sensor nodes are generally battery-powered devices. Batteries add size, weight and inconvenience to portable electronic devices and require periodical replacement. Nowadays the human power is an alternative and attractive energy source. Energy, which is generated during routine and seemingly insignificant human motions, shows promise {{as an alternative to}} power embedded wireless, mobile networks and wireless sensors. This paper describes the prototype of a smart garment and offers several alternative integration places of generator's parts, which are based on the principle of operation of the electromagnetic generator. Seven variants of location are proposed, which are tested and analysed. During the research, analysis of the most optimal placement of generator's part in garment has been performed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} <b>existing</b> military <b>capability</b> {{models and}} proposes a comprehensive capability meta-model (CCMM) which unites the <b>existing</b> <b>capability</b> models into an integrated and hierarchical whole. The Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture {{is used as}} a structure for the CCMM. The CCMM takes into account the abstraction level, the primary area of application, stakeholders, intrinsic process, and life cycle considerations of each <b>existing</b> <b>capability</b> model, and shows how the models relate to each other. The validity of the CCMM was verified through a survey of subject matter experts. The results suggest that the CCMM is of practical value to various capability stakeholders in many ways, such as helping to improve communication between the different capability communities...|$|R
40|$|Voluntary {{management}} {{standards for}} social and environmental performance ideally help to define and improve firms' related capabilities. These standards, however, have largely failed to improve such performance as intended. Over-emphasis on institutional factors leading to adoption of these standards has neglected the role of firms' <b>existing</b> <b>capabilities.</b> External pressures can drive firms to adopt standards more than their technical capacity to employ them. This can lead to problems of "fit" between institutional requirements and a firm's <b>existing</b> <b>capabilities.</b> We describe a conceptual model that considers the impact of an interaction between a firm's institutional requirements and its <b>existing</b> <b>capabilities</b> on standards failure. We suggest solutions that align institutional requirements to appropriate governance forms {{as a means to}} improve standards success. We contribute to theory by describing the role of firms' internal capabilities to the success of voluntary management standards and the reliability of self-regulation generally...|$|R

30|$|The gap {{identification}} {{process begins}} {{by examining the}} match between a proposed business model and the firm’s <b>existing</b> <b>capabilities.</b> An analysis of <b>existing</b> <b>capabilities</b> needs an objective {{point of view that}} is detailed and realistic. Organizational instincts tend to compel the exaggeration of current capabilities. The true magnitude of a gap may become apparent only after an organization falls short in executing a strategic initiative. The early phase of a project may be satisfactory, but as it progresses, problems begin to crop up, the senior team has to get more and more involved, and the goal slips further away. Management may have thought that a particular capability, such as supply chain management, was in place only to discover that it was inadequate to the needs of a new product or strategy.|$|R
