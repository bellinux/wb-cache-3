25|$|The {{predecessor}} to MBRRACE-UK, CMACE (Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries) {{produced a}} report every triennium, analysing all maternal deaths {{from the previous}} three years divided into topic-specific chapters. Reports are now published on an annual basis, with each report focusing on a selection of chapters. Furthermore, each MBRRACE-UK report now contains the Confidential Enquiry into <b>Maternal</b> <b>Morbidity</b> (CEMM), a study focusing on women who survived severe pregnancy problems, with the topic chosen in an open application process. The 2014 CEMM topic was maternal sepsis.|$|E
30|$|The total {{prevalence}} of intrapartum related <b>maternal</b> <b>morbidities</b> also decreased after {{the introduction of}} the birth centre (8.3 to 7.3  %). The decreasing trend observed in planned home, hospital and birth centre births, may suggest on average better care through more adequate selection of women and/or more adequate management, e.g. exact measurement of blood loss and early use of intramuscular oxytocin.|$|R
30|$|Intrapartum {{and early}} {{neonatal}} mortality and intrapartum related neonatal and <b>maternal</b> <b>morbidities</b> tended to decrease, while overall intervention rates were unaffected. The {{introduction of the}} midwife-led birth centre seems to benefit the outcome of midwife-led deliveries. We interpret this change by the redistribution of the higher risk women among the low risk population intending birth at the birth centre instead of home.|$|R
30|$|After the {{introduction}} of the birth centre a different risk selection was observed. Women’s characteristics were most unfavourable for intended birth centre births. Additionally, an higher neonatal risk load was seen within these women. After its introduction neonatal morbidities decreased (5.0 vs. 3.8  %) and <b>maternal</b> <b>morbidities</b> decreased (8.3 vs. 7.3  %). Interventions were about equal. Direct and indirect standardization provided similar results.|$|R
25|$|Both {{have higher}} risks than a vaginal birth with no {{previous}} caesarean section. There are many issues {{which must be}} taken into account when planning the mode of delivery for every pregnancy, not just those complicated by a previous caesarean section and there is a list of some of these issues in the list of indications for section in the first part of this article. A vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) confers a higher risk of uterine rupture (5 per 1,000), blood transfusion or endometritis (10 per 1,000), and perinatal death of the child (0.25 per 1,000). Furthermore, 20% to 40% of planned VBAC attempts end in caesarean section being needed, with greater risks of complications in an emergency repeat caesarean section than in an elective repeat caesarean section. On the other hand, VBAC confers less <b>maternal</b> <b>morbidity</b> and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies than elective repeat caesarean section.|$|E
25|$|While a fetus of ectopic {{pregnancy}} is typically not viable, very rarely, a live baby has been delivered from an abdominal pregnancy. In {{such a situation}} the placenta sits on the intraabdominal organs or the peritoneum and has found sufficient blood supply. This is generally bowel or mesentery, but other sites, such as the renal (kidney), liver or hepatic (liver) artery or even aorta have been described. Support to near viability has occasionally been described, but even in third world countries, the diagnosis is most commonly made at 16 to 20 weeks gestation. Such a fetus {{would have to be}} delivered by laparotomy. <b>Maternal</b> <b>morbidity</b> and mortality from extrauterine pregnancy are high as attempts to remove the placenta from the organs to which it is attached usually lead to uncontrollable bleeding from the attachment site. If the organ to which the placenta is attached is removable, such as a section of bowel, then the placenta should be removed together with that organ. This is such a rare occurrence that true data are unavailable and reliance must be made on anecdotal reports. However, the vast majority of abdominal pregnancies require intervention well before fetal viability because of the risk of bleeding.|$|E

She became increasingly interested in her view of the woman’s right to terminate their pregnancies, and in 1929 she brought forward her lecture [...] "The Right to Abortion" [...] in front of the World Sexual Reform Congress in London. In 1931 Browne began to develop her argument for women’s right to decide to have an abortion. She again began touring, giving lectures on abortion and the negative consequences that followed if women were unable to terminate pregnancies of their own choosing such as: suicide, injury, permanent invalidism, madness and blood-poisoning.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the ability of the gestational body mass index (BMI) method to screen for adverse birth outcomes and <b>maternal</b> <b>morbidities.</b> Design: This was a substudy of a randomised controlled trial, the Philani Mentor Mothers' study. Setting and subjects: The Philani Mentor Mothers' study took place in a peri-urban settlement, Khayelitsha, between 2009 and 2010. Pregnant women living in the area in 2009 - 2010 were recruited for the study. Outcome measures: Maternal anthropometry (height and weight) and gestational weeks were obtained at baseline to calculate the gestational BMI, which is maternal BMI adjusted for gestational age. Participants were classified into four gestational BMI categories: underweight, normal, overweight and obese. Birth outcomes and <b>maternal</b> <b>morbidities</b> were obtained from clinic cards after the births. Results: Pregnant women were recruited into the study (n = 1 058). Significant differences were found between the different gestational BMI categories and the following birth outcomes: maternal (p-value = 0. 019) infant hospital stay (p-value = 0. 03), infants staying for over 24 hours in hospital (p-value = 0. 001), delivery mode (p-value = 0. 001), birthweight (p-value = 0. 006), birth length (p-value = 0. 007), birth head circumference (p-value = 0. 007) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (p-value = 0. 001). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has used the gestational BMI method in a peri-urban South African pregnant population. Based on the findings that this method is able to identify unfavourable birth outcomes, it is recommended that it is implemented as a pilot study in selected rural, peri-urban and urban primary health clinics, and that its ease and effectiveness as a screening tool is evaluated.

Results: There were 6, 328 twin deliveries during the study period. Pregnancies carrying growth-discordant twins had higher frequencies of hypertension disorders, preterm labor, and cesarean delivery compared with growth-concordant twins. They also stayed longer than 3 days in hospital. Multivariate generalized estimating equation modeling found higher odds of preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preterm delivery, and cesarean delivery in mothers carrying growth-discordant twins compared with those carrying growth-concordant category. The modeling also resulted in higher odds in the length of stay longer than 3 days in mothers carrying growth-discordant twins compared with those carrying growth-concordant twins after adjustment for chorionicity. Conclusion: Maternal complications are associated with growth discordance. Screening for birth weight discordance during pregnancy may alert clinicians to predict subclinical maternal conditions.

[...] These talks urged women to take matters of their sexuality and their health into their own hands. Birth control was an embarrassing issue because it would directly challenge relations between men and women too, making this control for women a touchy subject. [...] During this tour several women asked Browne for abortions, however as Jones recognizes in her article, Browne was not “medically qualified” and had to refuse them. Though she was becoming increasingly interested in women’s right to terminate their pregnancies, she would still be considered a “heretic” were she to say so at this time. [...] Despite this, in 1929 she brought forward her lecture “The Right to Abortion” in front of the World Sexual Reform Congress in London. [...] In the years leading up to the presentation of this paper, Browne worked to gather information on maternal mortality, and found that rates were higher than ever before in 1929, and became the secretary of the Chelsea Labour Party in hopes of bringing ideas of birth control and abortion to light in political platform in 1926. [...] She was unable to do so as she was forced to leave Chelsea later in 1926, as the Party was no longer recognized as a political Party. By the end of the 1920s, Browne had felt that the fight for birth control had become more successful, as it was more frequently seen in the public sphere and was now being talked about and debated more openly. [...] In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference was a success bringing 700 delegates to attendance and bringing birth control into the political sphere, which she attended and spoke at. [...] In July 1930, the Ministry of Health issued MCW/153, which allowed local authorities to give birth control advice in welfare centres, another partial success for Browne.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To compare fetal and <b>maternal</b> <b>morbidities</b> between {{operative}} deliveries by long Teissier's spatulas and Minicup vacuum extractor. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A {{retrospective study}} was conducted from January 2003 to July 2008 at the maternity ward, Besançon teaching hospital. Operative deliveries in term cephalic singleton pregnancies performed by Teissier's spatulas (case group) were compared to previous deliveries by vacuum extractor Minicup (control group). RESULTS: During the study period, 69 operative deliveries by Teissier's spatulas have been performed. No {{significant difference was found}} between the two groups in terms of maternal characteristics. Two third-degree perineal tears occurred following delivery by Teissier's spatulas with no third-degree tear in the vacuum extractor group (p = ns). The episiotomy rate in the Teissier's spatulas group was 15, 9 % compared to 11. 6 % in the vacuum extractor group (p = ns). Duration of operative delivery was significantly shorter in the Teissier's spatulas group (3. 4 min vs 4. 95 min; p = 0. 007). Fetal morbidity was identical in the two groups. CONCLUSION: This study found no significant difference in terms of fetal and <b>maternal</b> <b>morbidities</b> between operative deliveries by Teissier's spatulas and vacuum extractor. Moreover, as opposed to Thierry's spatulas, the long Tessier spatulas can be adequately used in accordance with patient's wish and practice guidelines recommending a policy of restrictive episiotomy.
