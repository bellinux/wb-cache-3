40|$|Information was {{provided}} {{in this document}} to aid in protecting workers in grain elevators and feed mills from hazards encountered in these jobs. A description was included of grain elevators and feed mills along with statistical data correlating accidents with the population at risk. Attention was given to specific hazards associated with combustible dust {{as well as other}} hazards. The explosive properties of common dusts found in granaries were listed. Possible ignition sources are identified. Guidelines were included for training, use of personal protective equipment (including head, eye, face, respiratory, fall, hearing, foot, and hand protection), control of combustible dust, control of ignition sources, emergency planning, bin entry, isolation and lockouts, machine guarding, safe use of equipment and tools (including bucket elevators, electrical equipment, <b>manlifts,</b> hand and portable power tools, industrial trucks, ladders and scaffolds, compressed gas equipment, hoisting equipment, portable fire extinguishers, standpipes and hoses, automatic sprinklers, hydrants, explosion suppression, and fire fighting operations), and other work practices which will reduce the hazard level. A review was included of existing national and international standards and needs for further research were cited. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "September 1983. "Also available via the World Wide Web.

50|$|Occupational hazards {{encountered}} by glaziers include {{the risks of}} being cut by glass or tools and falling from scaffolds or ladders. The use of heavy equipment may also cause injury: the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) reported in 1990 that a journeyman glazier died in an industrial accident in Indiana after attempting to use a <b>manlift</b> to carry a thousand-pound case of glass which the <b>manlift</b> did not have capacity to carry.|$|E

5000|$|A belt <b>manlift</b> or <b>manlift</b> is {{a device}} for moving {{passengers}} between floors of a building. It {{is a simple}} belt with steps or platforms and handholds rather than an elevator with cars. Its design {{is similar to that}} of a paternoster. The belt is a loop that moves in a single direction, so one can go up or down by using the opposite sides of the loop. The belt moves continuously, so one can simply get on when a step passes and step off when passing any desired floor without having to call and wait for a car to arrive.|$|E
50|$|A special type of {{elevator}} is the paternoster, {{a constantly}} moving chain of boxes. A similar concept, called the <b>manlift</b> or humanlift, moves {{only a small}} platform, which the rider mounts while using a handhold seen in multi-story industrial plants.|$|E
5000|$|A {{paternoster}} ( [...] , , or [...] ) or paternoster lift is {{a passenger}} elevator {{which consists of}} a chain of open compartments (each usually designed for two persons) that move slowly in a loop up and down inside a building without stopping. Passengers can step on or off at any floor they like. The same technique is also used for filing cabinets to store large amounts of (paper) documents or for small spare parts. The much smaller belt <b>manlift</b> which consists of an endless belt with steps and rungs but no compartments is also sometimes called a paternoster.|$|E

40|$|The US Department of Energy's (DOE's) nuclear {{facility}} decontamination and decommissioning (D and D) program requires buildings to be decontaminated, decommissioned, and surveyed for radiological contamination in an expeditious and cost-effective manner. Simultaneously, {{the health and}} safety of personnel involved in the D and D activities is of primary concern. D and D workers must perform duties high off the ground, requiring the use of manlifts or scaffolding, often, in radiologically or chemically contaminated areas or in areas with limited access. Survey and decontamination instruments that are used are sometimes heavy or awkward to use, particularly when the worker is operating from a <b>manlift</b> or scaffolding. Finding alternative methods of performing such work on manlifts or scaffolding is important. The 2 -D Linear Motion System (2 -D LMS), also known as the Wall Walker{trademark}, is designed to remotely position tools and instruments on walls for use in such activities as radiation surveys, decontamination, and painting. Traditional (baseline) methods for operating equipment for these tasks require workers to perform duties on elevated platforms, sometimes several meters above the ground surface and near potential sources of contamination. The Wall Walker 2 -D LMS significantly improves health and safety conditions by facilitating remote operation of equipment. The Wall Walker 2 -D LMS performed well in a demonstration of its precision, accuracy, maneuverability, payload capacity, and ease of use. Thus, this innovative technology is demonstrated to be a viable alternative to standard methods of performing work on large, high walls, especially those that have potential contamination concerns. The Wall Walker was used to perform a final release radiological survey on over 167 m{sup 2 } of walls. In this application, surveying using a traditional (baseline) method that employs an aerial lift for manual access was 64 % of the total cost of the improved technology. However, for areas over approximately 600 m{sup 2 }, the Wall Walker would cost less than the baseline. Using the Wall Walker 2 -D LMS, ALARA exposure and worker safety is improved, and there is potential for increased productivity. This innovative technology performed better than the baseline by providing real-time monitoring of the tool or instrument position. Also, the Wall Walker 2 -D LMS can traverse any two-dimensional path at constant speeds of up to 18. 3 linear meters per minute (60 linear feet per minute). The survey production rate for the innovative technology was about 0. 6 m{sup 2 }/min (6 ft{sup 2 }/min); the baseline production rate was approximately 0. 3 m{sup 2 }/min (3 ft{sup 2 }/min), using the same surveying instrument and maximum scanning rate...|$|E
