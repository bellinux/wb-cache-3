5000|$|Hitler's regime swiftly {{destroyed}} {{both the}} German Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, the worst blow the world socialist movement had ever suffered. This forced Stalin to reassess his strategy, and from 1935 the Comintern began urging a <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> against fascism. The socialist parties were at first suspicious, given the bitter hostility of the 1920s, but eventually effective <b>Popular</b> <b>Fronts</b> were formed in both France and Spain. After {{the election of}} a <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> government in Spain in 1936 a fascist military revolt led to the Spanish Civil War. The crisis in Spain also brought down the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> government in France under Léon Blum. Ultimately the <b>Popular</b> <b>Fronts</b> were not able {{to prevent the spread of}} fascism or the aggressive plans of the fascist powers. Trotskyists considered <b>Popular</b> <b>Fronts</b> a [...] "strike breaking conspiracy" [...] and considered them an impediment to successful resistance to fascism.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of Bahrain (الجبهة الشعبية لتحرير البحرين) was an {{underground}} political party in Bahrain with {{origins in the}} Arab Nationalist Movement. Its members were inclined towards the leftist Marxist trend within the ANM. It was created after the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of Oman and the Arabian Gulf was reconstituted into two separate organizations as the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of Oman and the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> for the Liberation of Bahrain. Several PFLB members participated in the Dhofar Rebellion in Oman.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> of Estonia (Rahvarinne), {{introduced}} to the public by the Estonian politician Edgar Savisaar under the short-lived name <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> for the Support of Perestroika, was a political organisation in Estonia in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Edgar Savisaar introduced the idea of <b>popular</b> <b>front</b> during a TV show on 13 April 1988. The idea was developed through the year and finally The Estonian <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> was established on 1 October 1988 with a massively crowded congress which turned to a culmination of {{the first phase of}} the Singing Revolution.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> period (1934-1939). It {{marked the}} call by Comintern to all popular and {{democratic}} forces (not just Communist) to unite in <b>Popular</b> <b>Fronts</b> against fascism. Products {{of this period}} were the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> governments in France and Spain. However, this period was also marked by widespread purges of anyone suspected as {{an enemy of the}} Stalinist regime, both in the Soviet Union and abroad. These mass purges resulted in the breaking up of the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> in Spain amidst the Spanish Civil War and the fall of Spain to Francisco Franco.|$|R

The crisis in Spain brought down the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> government in France under Léon Blum. Ultimately the <b>Popular</b> <b>Fronts</b> were not able {{to prevent the spread of}} fascism or the aggressive plans of the fascist powers. Trotskyists considered <b>Popular</b> <b>Fronts</b> a [...] "strike breaking conspiracy", an impediment to successful resistance to fascism due to their inclusion of pro-capitalist parties which demanded policies of opposition to strikes and workers’ actions against the capitalist class.|$|R
50|$|In the Spanish 1936 {{election}}, the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> won {{the election}} with its leader Manuel Azaña elected President of Spain. The <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> received 4,654,116 votes compared to the opponent combined right-wing vote of 4,503,524 votes. It elected 278 deputies -99 of which belonged to the Socialists (PSOE)- while the right-wing elected 124 deputies -88 of which belonged to the CEDA. Many of the elected members of the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> were professional persons and several of which were from wealthy backgrounds. People of various political backgrounds within the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> were appointed to President Azaña's cabinet, such as Amós Salvador -an architect and wealthy landowner- and José Alonso Mallol, a former Radical Socialist. Upon {{the election of the}} <b>Popular</b> <b>Front,</b> the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> held a victory march in Madrid with over 250,000 supporters, with its Socialist and Communist party components marching in uniform in the thousands. The <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> immediately delivered its promise in its manifesto of rehiring workers fired for political reasons without due process and to reimburse them based on individual cases for wages lost to an extent of not less than thirty-nine days' wages nor more than six months.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> of Estonia {{together}} with the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> of Latvia and the Sąjūdis organised the Baltic Way mass [...] "arm-in-arm" [...] manifestation extending through three Baltic states on 23 August 1989 that marked 50th anniversary of 23 August 1939, when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, {{which resulted in the}} forcible incorporation of these three states into the Soviet Union and the loss of their independence. The front was opposed by the Intermovement that represented the pro-Soviet part of Estonia's ethnic Russian minority and other ethnic groups that had been settled in Estonia during the Soviet occupation period. The <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> was a supporter of perestroika, while the Intermovement was seen as opposed to Gorbachev's reforms. As time went by, an ever-greater chasm developed between the initial thrust of the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front,</b> leading members of which at first advocated mere autonomy within a Soviet system that Gorbachev was trying to reform in a cautious way, and the eventual context of the Estonian <b>Popular</b> <b>Front,</b> which came to stand for true independence, an idea supported by the rank and file. Consequently, the Estonian <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> changed a great deal over time, until political parties came to replace such movements in Estonia during the early nineties. This rendered the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> of Estonia an anachronism, and <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> was dissolved 1993.|$|R
50|$|Both parties {{claim to}} be the only {{legitimate}} successor of the Belarusian <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> established in 1989. The Malady <b>Front,</b> formerly the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front's</b> youth organization, has also become an autonomous organization.|$|R
50|$|Leon Trotsky and his far-left {{supporters}} roundly criticised the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> strategy. Trotsky {{believed that}} only united fronts could ultimately be progressive, and that <b>popular</b> <b>fronts</b> were useless because they included non-working class bourgeois forces such as liberals. Trotsky {{also argued that}} in <b>popular</b> <b>fronts,</b> working class demands are reduced to their bare minimum, {{and the ability of}} the working class to put forward its own independent set of politics is compromised. This view is now common to most Trotskyist groups. Left communist groups also oppose <b>popular</b> <b>fronts,</b> but they came to oppose united fronts as well.|$|R
50|$|In {{a new and}} {{effective}} tactic, the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> launched a rail blockade of Armenia, which caused petrol and food shortages because 85 percent of Armenia's freight came from Azerbaijan. Under pressure from the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> the Communist authorities in Azerbaijan started making concessions. On September 25, they passed a sovereignty law that gave precedence to Azerbaijani law, and on October 4, the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> was permitted to register as a legal organization {{as long as it}} lifted the blockade. Transport communications between Azerbaijan and Armenia never fully recovered. Tensions continued to escalate and on December 29, <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> activists seized local party offices in Jalilabad, wounding dozens.|$|R

50|$|In the 1930s the {{movement}} for a <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> called for a broad anti-fascist alliance involving Labour, the Liberals, the Communists and anti-fascist Conservatives. This policy was strongly supported by the Communist Party, whilst supporters of the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> such as Stafford Cripps achieved a significant degree of influence within the Labour Party at this time, particularly after {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish Civil War in 1936: however the Labour Party Conference voted against a <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> policy on several occasions.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> of Latvia (Latvijas Tautas fronte) was a {{political}} organisation in Latvia in late 1980s and early 1990s which led Latvia to its independence from the Soviet Union.

40|$|In The <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> Novel in Britain, 1934 - 1940, Elinor Taylor {{provides}} {{the first study}} {{of the relationship between}} the British novel and the anti-fascist <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> strategy endorsed by the Comintern in 1935. Through readings of novels by British Communists including Jack Lindsay, John Sommerfield, Lewis Jones and James Barke, Taylor shows that the realist novel of the left was a key site in which the politics of anti-fascist alliance were rehearsed. Maintaining a dialogue with theories of populism and with Georg Lukács’s vision of a revived literary realism ensuing from the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front,</b> this book at once illuminates the cultural formation of the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> in Britain and proposes a new framework for reading British fiction of this period...|$|R

40|$|Between 1934 and 1936 various organisations of the French left {{joined forces}} to create the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front,</b> an {{alliance}} borne of an antifascist imperative. After winning the May 1936 legislative elections, and in a climate of growing opposition from conservative and far right forces, the left-wing coalition came to power. By the end of 1938, the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> had collapsed and the right was back in power. During this period (1934 - 1938), the right and far right repeatedly challenged the left-wing alliance‟s legitimacy and attacked its constituent political parties. This conflict between left and right intensified France‟s political and social tensions and polarised French politics and French society into supporters and opponents of the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front.</b> This thesis examines {{the role of the}} right {{within the context of the}} <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> and seeks to answer the following question: how did the right act in response to the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> between 1934 and 1938 ? The thesis focuses on the Moselle, a border département returned to French sovereignty after forty-seven years under German domination (1871 - 1918). By 1934, the Moselle had developed a distinctive political character sympathetic to the right and hostile, or at best indifferent, to the left. By drawing parallels between Parisian and Mosellan events and using new archival material, the thesis demonstrates the originality of the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> in the Moselle, and the responses of the local, and essentially Catholic and particularist, right. No scholarly work has yet examined the conflict between the right and the left within the context of the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> in the Moselle. This thesis demonstrates how the département's distinctive historical, social, linguistic, cultural, political and religious context shaped the <b>Popular</b> <b>Front</b> and the right‟s responses to it...|$|R
