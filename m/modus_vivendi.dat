5|$|A <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> {{had been}} {{achieved}} between Warwick {{and the king}} for some months, but the restoration of Henry Percy to Montagu's earldom of Northumberland prevented any chance of full reconciliation. A trap was set for the king when disturbances in Lincolnshire led him north, where he could be confronted by Warwick's men. Edward, however, discovered the plot when Robert, Lord Welles, was routed at Losecote Field, and gave away the plan.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{a status}} quo {{agreement}} {{issued by the}} mandatory authority forbade the placing of benches or chairs near the Wall. The last occurrence of such a ban was in 1915, but the Ottoman decree was soon retracted after intervention of the Chacham Bashi. In 1928 the District Commissioner of Jerusalem, Edward Keith-Roach, acceded to an Arab request to implement the ban. This led to a British officer being stationed at the Wall making sure that Jews were prevented from sitting. Nor were Jews permitted to separate the sexes with a screen. In practice, a flexible <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> had emerged and such screens had been put up {{from time to time}} when large numbers of people gathered to pray.|$|E
5|$|Australia was {{particularly}} interested in developing atomic energy as the country was then thought to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal. Plans for atomic power were considered along with hydroelectricity {{as part of the}} post-war Snowy Mountains Scheme. There was also interest in the production of uranium-235 and plutonium for nuclear weapons. The Australian government had hopes of collaboration with Britain on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Unlike Canada, Australia was not a party to the Quebec Agreement or its successor, the 1948 <b>Modus</b> <b>Vivendi,</b> and Britain would not share technical information with Australia for fear that it might jeopardise its far more important relationship with the United States. The Americans were reluctant to share secret information with Australia after the Venona project revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia.|$|E
5|$|As prime minister, Sihanouk revoked {{a decree}} {{issued by the}} last {{resident}} superior of Cambodia, Georges Gautier, to romanise the Khmer alphabet. Following the Surrender of Japan in August 1945, nationalist forces loyal to Son Ngoc Thanh launched a coup, which led to Thanh becoming prime minister. When the French returned to Cambodia in October 1945, Thanh was dismissed and replaced by Sihanouk's uncle Sisowath Monireth. Monireth negotiated for greater autonomy in managing Cambodia's internal affairs. A <b>Modus</b> <b>Vivendi</b> was signed in January 1946 whereby Cambodia was granted full autonomy within the French Union. A joint French-Cambodian commission was set up after that to draft Cambodia's constitution, and in April 1946, Sihanouk introduced clauses which provided for an elected parliament {{on the basis of}} universal male suffrage as well as press freedom. The first constitution was signed into effect by Sihanouk in May 1947. Around this time, Sihanouk made two trips to Saumur, France where he attended military training at the Armoured Cavalry Branch Training School in 1946, and again in 1948. He was made a reserve captain for the French army.|$|E
5|$|British {{knowledge}} of thermonuclear weapons {{was based on}} work done at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended the conference on the Super (as it was then called) there in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946. The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and John von Neumann had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was tested in the American Operation Greenhouse George test in May 1951, but was also found to be unworkable. There was also some intelligence about Joe 4 derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 <b>Modus</b> <b>Vivendi.</b> Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston. Orange Herald, under Bryan Taylor, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo an interim thermonuclear design similar to Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design. Orange Herald {{would be the first}} British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator.|$|E
5|$|In Constantinople, Allied {{military}} representatives {{pushed to}} threaten the Ottoman government for the affair, while the French simultaneously explored the possibility of reaching a <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> with Kemal. The Allied Supreme Council, {{which at the time}} was working out the details to a peace treaty that it would present to the Ottoman government, deliberated on how best to respond. Some of the delegates present, including Prime Minister David Lloyd-George, insisted that strong pressure should be brought to bear against the Ottoman government to prevent new atrocities, but the other diplomats were skeptical of the idea. The officials also agreed that the Ottoman government should dismiss Kemal from office, although they admitted that such a move was impractical, since the Ottoman government held no control over Kemal, who was leading a counter Turkish government in Anatolia. A decision was finally reached on 10 March. British, French and Italian leaders agreed to authorize the formal occupation of Constantinople, which was carried out by the forces under General George F. Milne's command on the morning of 16 March.|$|E
5|$|In Greece, {{the eastern}} coasts of the Peloponnese and Central Greece {{remained}} in Byzantine hands as {{the theme of}} Hellas, while in the interior, various Slavic groups established themselves. A large native Greek population probably also remained in the land, either mixed with the Slavs or in its own autonomous communities. As elsewhere, a mostly peaceful <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> soon emerged between the Slavs and the remaining Byzantine strongholds, with the mainly agricultural Slavs trading with the Byzantine-held coastal towns. Further north, in the Greek mainland, {{by the turn of}} the 7th to 8th century smaller Slavic districts or sclaviniae emerged around the fringes of imperial territory, ruled by their own archons, who received Byzantine titles and recognized some form of imperial suzerainty. Imperial authority across Greece was greatly strengthened by the 783 campaign of the logothete Staurakios, who ventured from Constantinople overland to Thessalonica and from there south to the Peloponnese, subduing the Slavs of those regions.|$|E
5|$|In the Islamic East, the Caliph {{was forced}} to {{acknowledge}} {{the reality of the}} Saffarids' domination and established a <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> with them, perhaps hoping, according to Hugh Kennedy, to harness them in a partnership analogous to that which the Tahirids had enjoyed in previous decades. Consequently, the Saffarids were recognized in their possession of Khurasan and eastern Persia as well as Fars, while the Abbasids were to exercise direct control over western Persia, namely Jibal, Rayy and Isfahan. This policy gave the Caliph a free hand to recover the territories of the Dulafids, another semi-independent local dynasty that was centred on Isfahan and Nihavand. When the Dulafid Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Abi Dulaf died in 893, al-Mu'tadid moved swiftly to install his son al-Muktafi as governor in Rayy, Qazvin, Qum and Hamadan. The Dulafids were confined to their core region around Karaj and Isfahan, before being deposed outright in 896. Nevertheless, the Abbasid hold over these territories remained precarious, especially due to the proximity of the Zaydi emirate in Tabaristan, and in 897 Rayy was handed over to Saffarid control.|$|E
5|$|The victor in {{the tale}} is the farmer's wife: she regains her errant duck and is {{rid of the}} predatory fox. Ostensibly, she confiscates Jemima's eggs believing Jemima will abandon them, but the eggs are not confiscated for the {{well-being}} of Jemima and her kin but {{for the well-being of}} the farmer's wife and her family: the eggs (or the ducks hatched from them) will end up on their dinner table. In this respect, the farmer's wife is a predator like the fox, but the fox is condemned for his predation. Human values are {{at the top of the}} tale's hierarchy. Potter argues for the well-ordered home and the practicalities of farm life over the fantasy lives of animals. It was the <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> Potter was to incorporate in her own life as she devoted more of her thoughts and hours to the business of farming and less to tales of fantasy animals.|$|E
5|$|The low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP, {{which stood}} for Graphite Low Energy Experimental Pile, was {{designed}} by the Montreal Laboratory, {{and became the first}} nuclear reactor to operate in Western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by BEPO, a 6 MW research reactor designed by AERE, on 3 July 1948. Because heavy water was unavailable in Britain, BEPO was designed and built as a graphite-moderated reactor. Harwell was involved in the design of reactors at Windscale, and the chemical separation plant there. The passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) in August 1946, {{made it clear that the}} UK would no longer be allowed access to the United States' atomic research. This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of Alan Nunn May in February 1946. Cockcroft helped negotiate a new, more informal and unsigned agreement with the Americans that was announced on 7 January 1948, known as the <b>Modus</b> <b>Vivendi.</b> The renewed cooperation that he hoped for under the agreement proved illusory. The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958, and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E
5|$|While the Chetniks were an anti-Axis {{movement}} in their long-range goals and did engage in marginal resistance activities for limited periods, they also carried out almost {{throughout the war}} a tactical or selective collaboration with the occupation authorities against the Partisans. The Chetnik movement adopted a policy of collaboration with the Axis powers, and engaged in cooperation to {{one degree or another}} by establishing <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> or operating as auxiliary forces under Axis control. This was demonstrated in late 1942 and early 1943, when Ostojić planned and oversaw the Chetnik involvement in the large Axis anti-Partisan offensive Case White alongside Italian troops. In 1944, he became a leader of the Chetnik forces in Herzegovina, and along with Dobroslav Jevđević was involved in attempts {{to come to terms with}} the Allied forces. In late 1944, as the Partisans tightened their grip on the country and the Soviet Red Army captured Belgrade, he re-joined Mihailović in northeastern Bosnia but they could not agree on what course of action to take. Ostojić, along with Chetnik leaders Pavle Đurišić and Petar Baćović and Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić decided to move west to the area of the Ljubljana Gap in modern-day Slovenia where other friendly forces were concentrating. In early April 1945, faced with attacks by the Partisans and the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia (HOS) along their route, the combined Chetnik force was defeated by HOS forces in the Battle of Lijevče Field, after which Ostojić was captured by the Ustaše in an apparent trap. According to some sources, he was killed in the Jasenovac concentration camp alongside Đurišić, Baćović and Vasić.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{what the}} title might suggest, the book only briefly touches on the {{philosophy}} of vegetarianism and the associated diet. The book subtly stresses {{the idea of a}} non-vegetarian person deciding to practice veganism. This showcases the current trend surrounding veganism around the world and especially in the Western world, where it has gone from a niche <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> to a fairly common one.|$|E
25|$|In Paris, Ho Chi Minh {{achieved}} a <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> {{in negotiations with}} France by which a ceasefire in southern Vietnam was to come into effect on 30 October. France, however, did not promise independence for Vietnam. The fact that the ceasefire proved to be effective was {{a measure of the}} control the Viet Minh had over nationalist groups in southern Vietnam even though its power base was in the north.|$|E
25|$|The growing {{pressure}} of Congress {{and the public}} {{to go to war}} was met with some stiff opposition. Colombia had just recovered from the Thousand Days' War, and did not wished to be involved in another conflict, nor it had the resources to do so. Restrepo, was opposed to armed conflict, and wished to resolve matters diplomatically. Colombia's Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time, Enrique Olaya, who had the total support of the president, handled the matter with a hand great efficacy. On July 15, 1911, Olaya Herrera, and its Peruvian counterpart, Ernesto de Tezanos Pinto, signed a <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> agreement.|$|E
25|$|If Wilson's {{record as}} prime {{minister}} was soon felt to {{have been one of}} failure, that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by Callahan's term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing. It was little wonder, therefore, that Mrs. Thatcher resoundingly defeated it in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Burges came to {{the front}} rank of leaders on the ecclesiastical {{question}} in 1641, {{in connection with the}} effort made by the House of Lords for an accommodation of ecclesiastical differences. On 12 March the lords' 'committee for innovations' called in the assistance of a body of divines {{to take part in a}} sub-committee for examining alleged innovations in doctrine and discipline unlawfully introduced since the Reformation. Of seventeen divines who answered the summons six, headed by William Twisse, and including Burges, Marshall, and Calamy, constituted the section most opposed to the existing ecclesiastical system or its abuses. The four bishops and their friends on the sub-committee agreed to the proposed reformations; while, on the other hand, Twisse and his friends made no proposals antagonistic to episcopacy. The court party was stubborn against all concession; a growing party on the other side was for a more drastic treatment of episcopacy. The lords' attempt to find a <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Production {{facilities}} were constructed {{under the direction}} of Christopher Hinton, who established his headquarters in a former Royal Ordnance Factory at Risley in Lancashire. These included a uranium metal plant at Springfields, nuclear reactors and a plutonium processing plant at Windscale, and a gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment facility at Capenhurst, near Chester. The two Windscale reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. The gaseous diffusion plant at Capenhurst began producing highly enriched uranium in 1954. Uranium ore was stockpiled at Springfields. As the American nuclear programme expanded, its requirements became greater than the production of the existing mines. To gain access to the stockpile, they reopened negotiations in 1947. This resulted in the 1948 <b>Modus</b> <b>Vivendi,</b> which allowed for consultation on the use of nuclear weapons, and limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada. In the meantime, nuclear deterrence was provided by the United States Strategic Air Command, which had begun operating from British bases in 1949.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of his death he was a Cuban marxist revolutionary in Mexico trying to {{organize}} the overthrow of the Cuban government of General Gerardo Machado. This cause was an embarrassment to the Cuban Communist Party, which was trying to gain power by establishing a <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> with Machado. What further disturbed the Cuban communists was that they felt he had fallen under Leon Trotsky's influence. Mella was assassinated on January 10, 1929, while walking home late at night with photographer Tina Modotti. The Mexican government tried to implicate Modotti in the murder, even releasing nude photographs of her by Edward Weston in an attempt to generate public opinion against her. Muralist Diego Rivera played a very active role in defending her and exposing the Mexican government's crude attempt to frame her. It is unclear whether Mella was murdered by the dictatorial Cuban government; if his death had been brought about by Trotsky-Stalin Communist Party feuding; or by a combination of these mutual interests. It is widely speculated that he died by the notoriously bloody hand of Vittorio Vidali.|$|E
25|$|By March 1917, Senussi {{forces had}} been ordered to {{withdraw}} from Egypt into Libya. The attack by the Senussi on Egypt had not helped the Ottoman Empire to defeat the British east of the Suez Canal {{and the majority of}} the Egyptian population did not join the jihad and rise against the British. Sayed Ahmed was undermined by the defeat and his nephew, Sayyid Mohammed Idris, who had opposed the campaign, gained favour at his expense. The peace deal between the British and the Senussi agreed on 12 April 1917, recognised Idris as Emir of Cyrenaica (who eventually became King Idris I of Libya). Idris was required to hand over all British, Egyptian or Allied citizens who had been shipwrecked and to surrender or expel Ottoman officers and their allies. A force of fifty police was allowed at Jaghbub but no other military force could be allowed there, at Siwa or in Egypt. The British undertook to allow trade through Sollum and that although Jaghbub would remain Egyptian, it would be under the administration of Idris, as long as the undertaking not to allow military forces to enter Egypt was honoured. Two days later, Idris came to terms with the Italians and signed a <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi,</b> after which the Western Frontier remained calm {{for the rest of the}} war. Sayed Ahmed lingered for a year; in August 1918 he travelled to Constantinople by Austro-Hungarian submarine and conducted Pan-Islamic propaganda.|$|E
500|$|Continuing {{negotiations}} between the Germans and Partisan headquarters resulted in a further prisoner exchange on 17 November 1942. The second of these was negotiated by Stilinović and Vladimir Velebit, {{also a member of}} the Partisan Supreme Headquarters, and Ott was involved on the German side. On the day of the second prisoner exchange, the Partisans delivered a letter addressed to Glaise-Horstenau which apparently explained that the Partisans were [...] "an independent armed force with military discipline and not an agglomeration of bands", and [...] "proposed mutual application of the rules of international law, especially in regard to prisoners and wounded, a regular exchange of prisoners, and a sort of armistice between the two sides". Glaise-Horstenau, Kasche and others wanted to continue exchanging prisoners as a means of obtaining intelligence, and also wanted a <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> with the Partisans to allow the Germans to exploit the mineral resources of the NDH without disruption. In particular, they wanted to minimise disruption in the NDH south of the Sava river and on the Zagreb–Belgrade railway line. Adolf Hitler and Reich Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop were opposed to a <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi,</b> as they were afraid it would give the Partisans the status of a regular belligerent. As a result of Hitler's opposition, this Partisan proposal was not answered.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 1946, Britain had {{received}} , and another 500 was stockpiled for the Trust at Springfields, near Preston in Lancashire. Uranium ore was stockpiled in Britain because the McMahon Act did not permit it to be exported from the United States. Groves extended the arrangement into 1947, and another [...] was shipped to Britain, all of which {{was added to the}} Springfields stockpile. Its growing size was the principal reason the Americans reopened the negotiations resulting in the <b>Modus</b> <b>Vivendi,</b> which allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada. Under this agreement, all the Congo ore from 1948 and 1949 was shipped to the United States. The Trust was renamed the Combined Development Agency in January 1948.|$|E
500|$|What {{followed}} {{was a period}} of virtual control of the government by Lancaster, yet increasingly [...] particularly after the death of Warwick in 1315 [...] he found himself isolated. In August 1318, the so-called [...] "treaty of Leake" [...] established a <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> between the parties, whereby the king was restored to power while promising to uphold the Ordinances. Lancaster still had issues with the king, though—particularly with the conduct of the new favourite, Hugh Despenser the younger, and Hugh's father. In 1322, full rebellion broke out which ended with Lancaster’s defeat and execution at the Battle of Boroughbridge in March. At the parliament of May in the same year, the Ordinances were repealed. However, six clauses were retained that concerned such issues as household jurisdiction and appointment of sheriffs. Any restrictions on royal power were unequivocally annulled.|$|E
500|$|Dutch {{historian}} Leonard Blussé {{writes that}} the massacre indirectly led to {{the rapid expansion of}} Batavia, and institutionalised a <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> that led to a dichotomy between the ethnic Chinese and other groups, which could still be felt in the late 20th century. The massacre may also have been a factor in the naming of numerous areas in Jakarta. One possible etymology for the name of the Tanah Abang district (meaning [...] "red earth") is that it was named for the Chinese blood spilled there; van Hoëvell suggests that the naming was a compromise to make the Chinese survivors accept amnesty more quickly. The name Rawa Bangke, for a subdistrict of East Jakarta, may be derived from the vulgar Indonesian word for corpse, bangkai, due to the great number of ethnic Chinese killed there; a similar etymology has been suggested for Angke in Tambora.|$|E
500|$|The McMahon Act, {{which was}} signed by Truman on 1 August 1946, and went into effect at midnight on 1 January 1947, ended {{technical}} cooperation. Its control of [...] "restricted data" [...] prevented the United States' allies from receiving any information. The remaining scientists were denied access to papers that they had written just days before. The terms of the Quebec Agreement remained secret, but senior members of Congress were horrified when they discovered that it gave the British a veto {{over the use of}} nuclear weapons. The McMahon Act fuelled resentment from British scientists and officials alike, and led directly to the British decision in January 1947 to develop its own nuclear weapons. In January 1948, Bush, James Fisk, Cockcroft and Mackenzie concluded an agreement known as the <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi,</b> that allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada.|$|E
500|$|In early 1949 Sihanouk {{traveled}} to Paris {{with his parents}} {{to negotiate with the}} French government for more autonomy over Cambodia. The <b>Modus</b> <b>Vivendi</b> was replaced by a new Franco-Khmer treaty, which recognised Cambodia as [...] "independent" [...] within the French Union. In practice, the treaty granted only limited self-rule to Cambodia. While Cambodia was given free rein in managing its foreign ministry and to a lesser extent, its defence, most of the other ministries remained under French control. Meanwhile, dissenting legislators from the national assembly started attacking the government led by prime minister Penn Nouth over its failure to resolve deepening financial and corruption problems plaguing the country. The dissenting legislators, led by Yem Sambaur, who had defected from the Democrat party in November 1948, deposed Penn Nouth. Yem Sambaur replaced him, but his appointment did not sit well with the Democrats, who in turn pressured Sihanouk to dissolve the national assembly and hold elections.|$|E
500|$|In August 1942, {{during the}} Partisan Long March west through the Independent State of Croatia ( [...] , NDH), Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslav Partisans {{captured}} {{a group of}} eight Germans from the civil and military engineering group Organisation Todt near Livno. The leader of the captured group was a mining engineer, Hans Ott, who was also {{an officer of the}} Abwehr, the Wehrmacht's intelligence organisation. The captured group had been identifying new sources of metal and timber for the Germans, but Ott had also been tasked by the Abwehr with making contact with the Partisans. Following their capture, Ott told his captors that he had an important message to deliver to Partisan headquarters, and after he had been taken there he suggested to the Partisans that his group be exchanged for Partisans held by the Germans in jails in Zagreb. On that basis, Ott was sent to Zagreb on parole, where he met with the German Plenipotentiary General in Croatia, General der Infanterie (Lieutenant General) Edmund Glaise-Horstenau. He advised Glaise-Horstenau that Tito was willing to exchange the eight Germans for ten Partisans who were being held by the Germans, Italians and NDH authorities. Glaise-Horstenau contacted the commander of the Italian 2nd Army, Generale designato d'Armata (acting General) Mario Roatta, who had most of the identified Partisan prisoners in his custody. On 14 August, the German ambassador to the NDH, SA-Obergruppenführer (Lieutenant General) Siegfried Kasche, sent a telegram to the Reich Foreign Ministry advising of the proposed exchange and asked the Ministry to intercede with the Italians. In his book Tito, Mihailović, and the Allies, 1941–1945, published in 1973, the former US diplomat Walter Roberts argued that the Abwehr considered some sort of <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> with the Partisans might be possible, and were thinking of more than prisoner exchanges when they gave Ott the task of making contact with the Partisans. The number of Germans in Partisan custody had been increasing, and this made some sort of prisoner swap agreement more likely. These agreements were initially led by Marijan Stilinović on behalf of the Partisan Supreme Headquarters. On 5 September, a prisoner swap was completed in an area between Duvno and Livno, where 38 Partisans and family members were exchanged for one senior German officer who had been captured during the Battle of Livno in December 1942.|$|E

On a similar note, much like Neaman, he mentions that Jünger seems to be on a warmer level {{with the fact that the}} individual's necessary compliance with the new dehumanized worlds of technology.

2500|$|In late 1940 {{and early}} 1941, Prince Xavier {{assisted}} in opening the so-called [...] "Halifax-Chevalier negotiations", a confidential correspondence exchange between the British Foreign Secretary and the Petain-government education minister, centred mostly on {{working out a}} <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> between the British and the French colonies. The exact role of Prince Xavier is unclear. Some scholars claim he served as an intermediary, trusted by the British royal family, including king George VI, and by Pétain; as he did not leave France, it seems that he wrote letters which provided credibility for the envoys sent. Though the episode is subject to controversy, by some viewed as a proof of Petain’s double game and by some largely as a hagiographic mystification, the debate hardly relates {{to the role of}} Xavier.|$|E
2500|$|Abu Inan's own son and heir, al-Mu'tamid ruled Marrakesh {{practically}} independently - or, more accurately, Marrakesh {{was effectively}} ruled by Amir ibn Muhammad al-Hintati, the high {{chief of the}} Hintata of the High Atlas (one of the old Almohad Masmuda tribes). Al-Hintati dominated the surrounding region, brought the Marinid heir in Marrakesh under his thumb, and arranged a <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> with the sultan Abu Inan.

2500|$|This <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi</b> between Díaz and the Church had {{pragmatic and}} {{positive}} consequences. Díaz did not publicly renounce liberal anti-clericalism, {{meaning that the}} Constitution of 1857 remained in place, but neither did he enforce its anti-clerical measures. Conflict could reignite, but {{it was to the}} advantage of both Church and the Díaz government for this arrangement to continue. If the Church did counter Díaz, he had the constitutional means to rein in its power. The Church regained considerable economic power, with conservative intermediaries holding lands for it. The Church remained important in education and charitable institutions. Other important symbols of the normalization of religion in late 19th century Mexico included: the return of the Jesuits (expelled by the Bourbon monarchy in 1767); the crowning of the Virgin of Guadalupe as [...] "Queen of Mexico"; and the support of Mexican bishops for Díaz's work as peacemaker. Not surprisingly, when the Mexican Revolution broke out in 1910, the Catholic Church was a staunch supporter of Díaz.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{of foreigners}} {{arriving}} in Russia are seeking jobs. In many cases {{they have no}} preliminary contracts or other agreements with a local employer. A typical problem is the illegal status of many foreigners (i.e., they are not registered and have no identity papers), what deprives them of any social assistance (as of 2004) and often leads to their exploitation by the employer. Despite that, foreigner workers still benefit, what with seeming reluctance of regional authorities {{to solve the problem}} forms a sort of <b>modus</b> <b>vivendi.</b> As Gil-Robles noted, it's easy to imagine that illegal status of many foreigners creates grounds for corruption. [...] Illegal immigrants, even if they have spent several years in Russia may be arrested at any moment and placed in detention centres for illegal immigrants for further expulsion. As of 2004, living conditions in detention centers are very bad, and expulsion process lacks of funding, what may extend detention of immigrants for months or even years. Along with that, Gil-Robles detected a firm political commitment to find a satisfactory solution among authorities he spoke with.|$|E
