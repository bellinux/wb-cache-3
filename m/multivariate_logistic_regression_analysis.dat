MethodsA total of 42 patients with hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis who were admitted to The People′s Hospital of Guang′an from January 2014 to June 2016 were enrolled as study group, and 42 patients with non-hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (biliary or alcoholic) were enrolled as control group. The two groups were compared in terms of sex, age, fatty liver, body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, family history of hyperlipidemia, serum triglyceride, serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), whole blood low-shear viscosity, and D-dimer concentration at the time when they visited the hospital.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether FFP use is associated with VT in extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWIs). We performed a matched case-control study on risk factors for VT in ELBWIs born over a period of 5 years in the neonatal intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital. Controls were infants from the unit matched for gestational age and birth weight. We performed univariate analyses and created receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the cut-off values of continuous parameters such as FFP. We also conducted <b>multivariate</b> conditional <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> <b>analysis</b> and calculated adjusted odds ratios and their 95 % confidence intervals.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients after renal transplantation during immunosuppression might increase morbidity and mortality. Hence {{the timing of}} catheter removal is still controversial. The associated risk factors of this complication have not been analyzed. We analyzed, retrospectively, the incidence of peritonitis within 90 days after transplantation, its associated morbidity and mortality, as well as risk factors. From 1980 until March 1995, 238 consecutive kidney transplants in peritoneal dialysis patients were performed. Univariate and <b>multivariated</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> <b>analysis</b> were used to identify risk factors {{for the development of}} peritonitis. 232 cases (141 men, 91 women) were available for analysis. In 191 patients, the catheter was removed with a mean interval after transplantation of 122 days (range 0 - 573). Thirty peritonitis episodes with predominantly Staphylococcus aureus (10 / 30) or gram-negative bacteria (12 / 30) were observed. Independent risk factors before transplantation were the total number of peritonitis episodes (P < 10 (- 5)), previous peritonitis with S. aureus bacteria (P < 10 (- 5)), and male sex (P < 0. 004). Risk factors after transplantation were technical surgical problems (P < 10 (- 5)), more than two rejection episodes (P < 0. 02), permanent graft nonfunction (P < 0. 026), and urinary leakage (P < 0. 035). Transplantation without simultaneous peritoneal catheter removal is feasible. However, this increases the risk of peritonitis after transplantation. Early catheter removal should be considered seriously in those patients at risk. When peritonitis develops, antibiotic treatment should be directed against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria until culture results are availabl...|$|R
