50|$|He {{trained for}} the priesthood at the {{so-called}} Illyrian College of Loretto, south of Ancona in Italy, where many Albanians and Dalmatians of renown were to study. {{at the age}} of 21, he was ordained as a Catholic priest and was sent immediately to Macedonia and Kosovo, then part of the eccesiastical province of Serbia {{under the jurisdiction of the}} archbishop of Antivar, where he served various parishes for an initial 12 years. in 1610, he was referred to as chaplan of Christianity in Skopje and. in 1647, as chaplan of Prokupolje. In Kosovo, Budi came into contact with Franciscan Catholics from Bosnia. These connections proved fruitful in later years for his political endeavors to <b>mount</b> <b>support</b> for Albanian resistance to the Ottoman Empire. In 1599, Budi was appointed vicar-general (vicario generale) of Serbia, a post held for 17 years. As a representative of the Catholic Church in the Turkish-occupied Balkans, he lived and worked in what was no doubt a tense of political atmosphere. His ecclesiastical position was in many way only a cover for his political aspirations.In 1616, he traveled to Rome, where he resided until 1618 to oversee the poblications of his works. On 20 July 1621, he was made bishop of Sapa and Sarda (i.e of the Zadrima region of northern Albania), and returned to Albania the following year.|$|E

40|$|The {{vibrational}} {{aspects of}} recent disturbances {{at the low}} beta focusing quadrupoles, which caused proton beam loss at the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF), are discussed. Two low beta focusing quadrupoles are supported by a girder, which is extended over the CDF collision hall pit on each side. The low beta girder has a ledge <b>mount</b> <b>support</b> at an alcove's face and two Invar rods near the opposite end. Forced response measurements were taken on the low beta girder, where the power spectral density (PSD) function was used to obtain RMS displacement. The effects of local excitation due to operating equipment and near-field excitation due to ambient ground motion caused by local traffic are examined. The discussion explores dynamic response characteristics of the low beta quadrupoles and supporting girder using beam loss as the vibrational stability criteria. This paper also presents practical problem-solving approaches for similar accelerator components...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A Grid {{computing}} environment allows forming Virtual Organizations (VOs) to aggregate and share resources. We present a VO File System (VOFS) {{which is a}} secure VO-aware distributed file system that allows VO members to share files within a VO. VOFS supports access and location transparency by maintaining a common file namespace, which is decentralized to avoid a {{single point of failure}} in order to improve robustness of the file system. VOFS includes a P 2 P system of file servers, a VO membership service and a policy and role based security mechanism that protects the VO files from unauthorized access. VOFS can be mounted to a local file system in order to access files using a standard POSIX file API. VOFS can operate in a dynamic Grid environment (e. g. desktop Grids) since it is able to tolerate unplanned resource arrival and departure (churn) while maintaining a single uniform namespace. It supports transparent disconnected operations that allow the user to work on cached files while being disconnected. Furthermore, VOFS is a user level technique, and the current WebDAV-based VOFS prototype can operate under any operating system that has WebDAV <b>mount</b> <b>support.</b> Key words: grid file system, virtual organization, peer-to-peer, security, namespace 1.

40|$|AIM is an {{initiative}} in interactive mathematics, which exploits {{the power of}} the computer algebra package Maple V in an extremely flexible way that can be applied to a variety of curricula. The authors present the results of a project concerned with replacing parts of core first year materials at the University of Birmingham, UK. Most software for computer-based assessment has limited use in mathematics. Common problems are: · Poor display of mathematical expressions. (despite MathML and plug-ins like IBM TechExplorer), · Restricted choice of question types, · Failure to recognise mathematically equivalent solutions, · Difficulty of assigning partial credit, · Inability to test students ' creativity (eg give an example of a function which satisfies XXX but does not satisfy YYY) Effective integration of computer algebra has made it possible to address these issues. The ability to monitor students ' progress in more detail has allowed us to provide individual students with tailored advice on suitable additional learning opportunities (e. g. the use of appropriate learning packages) and to efficiently <b>mount</b> <b>support</b> activities (e. g. targeted small group sessions). This has enhanced and made more focussed support for our students. Pilot studies have been very encouraging. Students find the software easy to use (97 % agree/strongly agree), like the immediate feedback (100 % agree/strongly agree), and find it helpful (87 % agree/strongly agree). Our paper: outlines the genesis and nature of AIM, reports and elaborates on the above results, offers an indication of the range of applicability of this shareware- from widening participation to honing advanced specialist skills. Of particular interest is a parallel study, which explores the factors, which determine whether an innovation is likely to be easily transferable. We look to distil principles of value to innovators in the learning and teaching of mathematics. 1. Introduction- Wha...|$|E
