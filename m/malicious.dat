5|$|A {{number of}} {{statutory}} provisions creating offences of damaging {{specific types of}} property were consolidated by 7 & 8 Geo.4 c.30 (1827) (<b>Malicious</b> injuries to property) {{which was one of}} Peel's Acts. This Act and a number of subsequent statutes were consolidated by the <b>Malicious</b> Damage Act 1861.|$|E
5|$|The SecuROM {{software}} {{also caused}} some virus scanners and malware detector {{to believe the}} software was <b>malicious.</b> 2K Games assured players that the software installation process did not install any <b>malicious</b> code or rootkit However, players observed {{that some of the}} SecuROM software was not fully removed on uninstallation of the game.|$|E
5|$|After a brief spell as a printer's apprentice, Griswold {{moved to}} Syracuse where, with some friends, {{he started a}} {{newspaper}} called The Porcupine. This publication purposefully targeted locals for what was later remembered as merely <b>malicious</b> critique.|$|E
5|$|Her third husband, Asa Gilbert Eddy, died {{five years}} after they married; she {{believed}} he {{had been killed by}} <b>malicious</b> animal magnetism. Six years later, when she was 67 and apparently in need of loyalty and affection, she legally adopted a 41-year-old homeopath as her second son.|$|E
5|$|If an {{extraterrestrial}} civilization bearing malice towards humanity gained sufficient {{knowledge of}} terrestrial biology and {{weaknesses in the}} immune systems of terrestrial biota, it {{might be able to}} create extremely potent biological weapons. Even a civilization without <b>malicious</b> intent could inadvertently cause harm to humanity by not taking account of all the risks of their actions.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Fortinet {{researchers}} said a Facebook widget from Zango had tricked {{more than}} three million users into downloading <b>malicious</b> spyware under the guise of telling users their secret crush. Zango denied the allegations, saying their software was opt-in.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, a bug was {{discovered}} by İnci Sözlük that could allow a Twitter user to force others to follow them without the other users' consent or knowledge. For example, comedian Conan O'Brien's account, which had been set to follow only one person, was changed to receive nearly 200 <b>malicious</b> subscriptions.|$|E
5|$|On 10 November 2015, Microsoft {{released}} a security update to mitigate a security vulnerability in BitLocker that allowed authentication to be bypassed by employing a <b>malicious</b> Kerberos key distribution center, if the attacker had physical {{access to the}} machine, the machine was part of domain and had no PIN or USB protection.|$|E
5|$|Version 1.0.1g of OpenSSL adds some bounds {{checks to}} prevent the buffer over-read. For example, the {{following}} test was introduced {{to determine whether a}} heartbeat request would trigger Heartbleed; it silently discards <b>malicious</b> requests.|$|E
5|$|Version 2001 (2.5) was {{released}} September 18, 2000, adding support for Windows ME {{in addition to}} the Windows 9x series, Windows NT, and Windows 2000. Following attacks by the ILOVEYOU and Anna Kournikova script viruses, this version can block <b>malicious</b> scripts without virus signatures, but by analyzing behavior.|$|E
5|$|A major {{corrective}} opportunity {{this year}} involved the rerelease {{of one of}} the earliest <b>malicious</b> biographies of Mrs. Eddy, The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science by Georgine Milmine. Dating from the yellow journalism period, this book was published in an attempt to discredit her. The current publisher, after much correspondence with our office, instead issued a statement accurately characterizing its bias. The book has received almost no attention in the public, proving if Truth isn't spoken, nothing is said.|$|E
5|$|A {{security}} vulnerability {{was reported}} on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith. Since Twitter used {{the phone number}} of the sender of an SMS message as authentication, <b>malicious</b> users could update someone else's status page by using SMS spoofing. The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim's account. Within {{a few weeks of}} this discovery, Twitter introduced an optional personal identification number (PIN) that its users could use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages.|$|E
5|$|And others again, whom God {{had formed}} with mild and gentle dispositions, think it {{necessary}} to put a force upon their own tempers, by acting a noisy, violent, <b>malicious</b> part, {{as a means to}} be distinguished. Thus hath party got the better of the very genius and constitution of our people; so that whoever reads the character of the English in former ages, will hardly believe their present posterity to be of the same nation or climate.|$|E
5|$|Braithwaite and Raghip were {{released}} immediately. Silcott remained {{in jail for}} the 1984 murder of Anthony Smith. He received £17,000 compensation in 1991 for his conviction in the Blakelock case, and in 1995 was offered up to £200,000 in legal aid to sue the police for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The Metropolitan Police {{settled out of court}} in 1999, awarding him £50,000 for false imprisonment and <b>malicious</b> prosecution. He was released on licence in October 2003 having served 17 years for Smith's murder.|$|E
5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach <b>malicious</b> governors, but that would surely harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E
5|$|In some circumstances, {{the conduct}} of the {{defendant}} can be a factor in determining the unreasonableness of their interference. In this situation the motives of the defendant and the reasonableness of their conduct are the factors used to determine the unreasonableness of their actions. This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, the defendant was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were <b>malicious,</b> unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E
5|$|Life Is Good {{features}} personal subject matter, {{themes of}} adulthood and nostalgia, and reflections on Nas' {{personal life and}} experience in hip hop. His rapping {{is characterized by a}} relaxed, plainspoken flow, internal rhymes, and a tone that veers from <b>malicious</b> to nostalgic and introspective. The album's production incorporates orchestral elements and musical references to both contemporary and golden age hip hop, including boom bap beats and old school samples.|$|E
5|$|Lyon {{also has}} the {{distinction}} of being the only person to be elected to Congress while in jail. On October 10, 1798, he was found guilty of violating the Alien and Sedition Acts, which prohibited <b>malicious</b> writing about the American government as a whole, or of the houses of Congress, or of the president. During the Quasi War with France, Lyon {{was the first person to}} be put to trial for violating the acts after he published editorials criticizing Federalist President John Adams.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{consider}} this highly implausible however, noting that <b>malicious</b> rumours {{such as those}} concerning Domitia's alleged infidelity were eagerly repeated by post-Domitianic authors, and used to highlight the hypocrisy of a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals, while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court. Nevertheless, the account of Suetonius has dominated imperial historiography for centuries.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of September3, 2007, a <b>malicious</b> fire was set {{in the base of}} the Webster Sycamore's trunk. The fire burned up through the hollow center of the tree's hollow bole. The Webster Springs Fire Department, Webster County Sheriff's Department, and the West Virginia Division of Forestry provided a joint response to the fire, and remained on the scene for several hours until the flames were out. The tree survived the blaze but suffered irreparable damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{firewall}} {{makes all}} decisions by itself {{to lessen the}} chance of being weakened by a misinformed decision. Applications known to be safe are allowed Internet access, and vice versa for <b>malicious</b> applications. Unknown ones are analyzed and blocked if they exhibit <b>malicious</b> behavior. In both PC Magazine and PC Pro testing, the firewall did not incorrectly block any safe applications from Internet access. All malware was blocked by the firewall. PC Magazine testing reflected the same results. The firewall also stealthed all ports. Exploits were blocked by the intrusion prevention system, which prevents threats from leveraging vulnerabilities. The system is updated whenever a vulnerability is identified for Windows-based computers. Attempts to disable the firewall were unsuccessful; registry changes, process termination, and simulated mouse clicks all failed. Disabling Windows services {{had no effect on}} the firewall since it works at the kernel driver level. This version automatically adjusts configuration for different networks based on the physical address of the gateway rather than IP addresses.|$|E
5|$|There {{came to me}} Bowes, by whom I do {{understand}} that my wife is dead and as he sayeth by a fall {{from a pair of}} stairs. Little other understanding can I have of him. The greatness and the suddenness of the misfortune doth so perplex me, until I do hear from you how the matter standeth, or how this evil should light upon me, considering what the <b>malicious</b> world will bruit, as I can take no rest.|$|E
5|$|New Thought and Christian Science {{differed}} in that Eddy saw her views {{as a unique}} and final revelation. Eddy's idea of <b>malicious</b> animal magnetism marked another distinction (that people can be harmed by the bad thoughts of others), introducing an element of fear that was absent from the New Thought literature. Most significantly, she dismissed the material world as an illusion, rather than as merely subordinate to Mind, leading her to reject the use of medicine, or materia medica, and making Christian Science the most controversial of the metaphysical groups. Reality for Eddy was purely spiritual.|$|E
5|$|Patrick Trench (Angus Deayton) – Patrick and {{his wife}} Pippa live next door to Victor, and often catches Victor engrossed in {{seemingly}} preposterous situations, all of which in context are perfectly innocuous. The couple's relationship with their neighbours begins badly after Victor mistakes Patrick and Pippa for distant relations when they arrive outside with three suitcasesnot realising that they are his next-door neighbours, having been on a lengthy holiday from the day Victor and Margaret moved in. Victor subsequently invites the bemused pair to stay; this and later incidents cause Patrick to suspect that Victor is quite insane, possibly bordering on <b>malicious.</b>|$|E
5|$|The tengu's {{unpleasant}} image {{continued to}} erode in the 17th century. Some stories now presented {{them as much}} less <b>malicious,</b> protecting and blessing Buddhist institutions rather than menacing them or setting them on fire. According to a legend in the 18th-century , a tengu {{took the form of}} a yamabushi and faithfully served the abbot of a Zen monastery until the man guessed his attendant's true form. The tengu's wings and huge nose then reappeared. The tengu requested a piece of wisdom from his master and left, but he continued, unseen, to provide the monastery with miraculous aid.|$|E
5|$|With Van Melkebeke, Hergé put {{together}} two Tintin plays. The first, Tintin in the Indies, appeared at Brussels' Theatre des Galeries in April 1941, while the second, Mr Boullock's Disappearance, was performed there in December. From October 1941 to May 1942, Le Soir serialised Hergé's next Tintin adventure, The Shooting Star, followed by publication {{as a single}} volume by Casterman. In keeping with Le Soirs editorial standpoint, The Shooting Star espoused an anti-Semitic and anti-American attitude, with the antagonist being a wealthy Jewish American businessman; it would thus prove particularly controversial in the post-war period, although Hergé denied any <b>malicious</b> anti-Semitic intention.|$|E
25|$|In late 2010, {{the results}} of browser malware testing {{undertaken}} by NSS labs were published. The study looked at the browser's capability to prevent users following socially engineered links of a <b>malicious</b> nature and downloading <b>malicious</b> software. It did not test the browser's ability to block <b>malicious</b> web pages or code.|$|E
25|$|Another defense {{approach}} is to use automated tools that will remove XSS <b>malicious</b> code in web pages, these tools use static analysis and/or pattern matching methods to identify <b>malicious</b> codes potentially and secure them using methods like escaping.|$|E
25|$|Normal {{phishing}} attempts can {{be easy to}} spot {{because the}} <b>malicious</b> page's URL will usually {{be different from the}} real site link. For covert redirect, an attacker could use a real website instead by corrupting the site with a <b>malicious</b> login popup dialogue box. This makes covert redirect different from others.|$|E
25|$|Some browsers include partial {{protection}} against reflected XSS attacks, {{in which the}} attacker provides a URL including <b>malicious</b> script. However, even users of those browsers are vulnerable to other XSS attacks, such as those where the <b>malicious</b> code is stored in a database. Only correct design of Web applications on the server side can fully prevent XSS.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Toler is a <b>malicious</b> agent {{planted by}} Doro in Anyanwu’s Louisiana plantation.|$|E
25|$|Several {{vulnerability}} {{issues were}} discovered and exploited by <b>malicious</b> users. One such issue is DNS cache poisoning, in which data is distributed to caching resolvers under {{the pretense of}} being an authoritative origin server, thereby polluting the data store with potentially false information and long expiration times (time-to-live). Subsequently, legitimate application requests may be redirected to network hosts operated with <b>malicious</b> intent.|$|E
25|$|It creates {{security}} {{holes that}} can be exploited by <b>malicious</b> software such as worms or viruses.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the youths}} who {{attacked}} Jake Schofield turned themselves in to police and were charged with armed robbery, wounding, <b>malicious</b> wounding with intent, affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Two others, Wael Tahan and Mahmoud Eid, had been arrested {{on the night of}} the attack but were released without charge before being rearrested and charged with robbery in company, <b>malicious</b> wounding causing grievous bodily harm and affray.|$|E
25|$|Covert Redirection takes {{advantage}} of third-party clients susceptible to XSS or Open Redirect attacks. Normal phishing attempts can be easy to spot, because the <b>malicious</b> page's URL will usually be off {{by a couple of}} letters from that of the real site. The difference with Covert Redirection is that an attacker could use the real website instead by corrupting the site with a <b>malicious</b> login pop-up dialogue box.|$|E
25|$|A mild form of {{hallucination}} {{is known}} as a disturbance, and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision, or hearing faint noises and/or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia. They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or <b>malicious,</b> cursing the subject, etc. Auditory hallucinations of the <b>malicious</b> type are frequently heard, for example people talking about the subject behind his/her back. Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart is the feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with <b>malicious</b> intent. Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.|$|E
