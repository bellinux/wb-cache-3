His reign also marked a blossoming of Byzantine culture, and his building program yielded such masterpieces as the church of Hagia Sophia.

5|$|Although Shetlands {{are small}} and slow-growing {{compared}} to commercial breeds, they are hardy, thrifty, easy lambers, adaptable and long-lived. The Shetland breed has survived for centuries in difficult conditions and on a poor diet, but they thrive in better conditions. Shetlands retain many of their primitive survival instincts, so they are easier to care for than <b>many</b> <b>modern</b> breeds.|$|E
5|$|Common {{and often}} basic {{ingredients}} in <b>many</b> <b>modern</b> European cuisines like potatoes, kidney beans, cacao, vanilla, tomatoes, chili peppers and maize {{were not available}} to Europeans until after 1492, after European contact with the Americas, and even then it often took considerable time, sometimes several centuries, for the new foodstuffs {{to be accepted by}} society at large.|$|E

5|$|Gobioolithus {{eggs are}} small and smooth-shelled. They are asymmetrically shaped, similar to <b>many</b> <b>modern</b> bird eggs, with one end pointier than the other. The two oospecies are {{distinguished}} mainly by their size: G. major ranges from 50 to 53.5mm long and 25 to 32mm across, with an eggshell thickness of 0.2-0.4mm, whereas G. minor is only 30-46mm by 20-24mm and 0.1-0.2mm thick.|$|E

5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>modern</b> {{birds are}} highly social, often found living in flocks. There is general {{agreement}} that some {{behaviors that are}} common in birds, {{as well as in}} crocodiles (birds' closest living relatives), were also common among extinct dinosaur groups. Interpretations of behavior in fossil species are generally based on the pose of skeletons and their habitat, computer simulations of their biomechanics, and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>modern</b> insect genera {{developed}} during the Cenozoic. Insects from this period on are often found preserved in amber, often in perfect condition. The body plan, or morphology, of such specimens is thus easily compared with modern species. The study of fossilized insects is called paleoentomology.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>modern</b> {{scholars}} {{contend that}} the seemingly Christian nature of the poem is due to Virgil referencing Eastern oracles, {{which may have been}} influenced by Jewish texts and prophecies. For instance, Robin Nisbet, after carefully analyzing the work, ultimately concluded that Virgil probably appropriated some elements used in the poem from Jewish mythology by means of Eastern oracles, and later adapted them towards Western (which is to say, Roman) modes of thought.|$|E

Classical Nahuatl had a passive voice (also sometimes defined as an impersonal voice), but this is not found in most modern varieties.

5|$|Numerous authors {{described}} cretinism, myxoedema {{their relationship}} with the thyroid in the nineteenth century. Charles Mayo coined the term hyperthyroidism in 1910, Hakaru Hashimoto documented a case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in 1912, and autoantibodies were demonstrated in 1956. Knowledge of the thyroid and its conditions developed throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with <b>many</b> <b>modern</b> treatments and investigative modalities evolving throughout the mid twentieth century, including the use of radioactive iodine, thiouracil and fine needle aspiration.|$|E
5|$|The {{occurrence}} of disturbed behaviour {{in people with}} jaundice may have been described in antiquity by Hippocrates of Cos (ca. 460–370BCE).

5|$|There are <b>many</b> <b>modern</b> {{editions of}} Sherman's memoirs. The edition most useful for {{research}} purposes is the 1990 Library of America version, edited by Charles Royster.

5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. <b>Many</b> <b>modern</b> civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E
