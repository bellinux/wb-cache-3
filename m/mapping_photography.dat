Antanas Gustaitis, a prominent Lithuanian aircraft constructor and commander of Lithuanian Military Aviation, invited Marcinkus to participate in a trans-European flight, along with Jonas Liorentas, Juozas Namikas, Jonas Mikėnas, and Kazys Rimkevičius. After detailed planning and preparation, the trans-European flight was begun in the same year. During the 25 days of their flight, the pilots flew three of Gustaitis' designed aircraft, the ANBO IVs, over 10,000 kilometers and visited 12 European capitals. The Lithuanian pilots were warmly welcomed in the countries they visited. They were received by the British Royal Family and the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.|$|E

General Hulen assured the citizens of Houston that the new air squadron was not a daredevil outfit. Hulen believed that the reactivation of Ellington Field as a reserve basewould provide Houston an airfield and rekindle public interest in military aviation. With the news of the formation of the Air Squadron, one Houston Chronicle reporter christened the 111th Observation Squadron [...] "Houston’s Own," [...] thus beginning a long relationship between Houston and the National Guard.

50|$|In 1933, Marcinkus {{advanced}} {{to the rank of}} lieutenant, which was conferred by Lithuanian President, Antanas Smetona. In the same year he married Aleksandra Lingytė. Lingytė was also a prominent Lithuanian sportswoman; she won several basketball championships for Lithuania. Around the same time, inspired by Klemensas Martinkus, Marcinkus became a paratrooper instructor. Soon he became a parachuting master in the air force and participated in various air shows.In 1934 Marcinkus was transferred to the air reconnaissance department, there he started improving his expertise in independent flying, <b>mapping,</b> <b>photography,</b> and weapon systems. 1934 proved to be a challenging year for Marcinkus.

He was also named head of the aviation physical education department. He went on to establish a junior football team and teach German. His superiors noted that Marcinkus seemed more interested in sports than in his military duties at that time. His sporting career ended in 1938, however, when he injured a knee and was forced to abandon football. Despite {{the fact that he was}} decorated with steel wings (plieno sparnai), the highest award in Lithuanian military aviation, the following year proved very trying on a personal level. He was burdened with debts and underwent a nervous breakdown. His military career was interrupted by a scandal and he was transferred to the reserves.|$|E

Approximately 400 children living and working on six Turkish cities, 30 social workers and the project co-ordinator group participated in the study. The project was aimed at understanding the living and working experiences of children on urban streets and collectively generating knowledge through broad participation about solutions to improve children’s experiences in this environment. The study applied quantitative techniques to reveal the background knowledge of children. Qualitative techniques were used in order to enable children to participate and generate knowledge they could use for self-improvement.

Given our engagement with everyday places and a participatory research approach, we explicitly focus and evaluate the research methods for their qualities in revealing different aspects of place, and for their success in involving young people with various interests and abilities actively in the whole research process. The findings suggest that, in addition to revealing diverse aspects of everyday places and practices on different levels of detail, the ’new’ research methods motivate and enable different individuals to participate and share their experiences. Furthermore, combining the ’new’ methods or combining them with interviews has an added value as such a mix is able to paint a detailed picture of daily places, colored by the way different individuals see, hear, smell, use or experience them...|$|E

40|$|This ethnographic {{exploration}} of contemporary spaces of homelessness takes an expanded view of homeless space, threading together experiences of organizational spaces, routes taken {{through the city}} and the occupation of public space. Through engaging with participants' accounts of movement and place, the book argues that young homeless people become fixed in mobility, a condition that impacts on both everyday life and possible futures. Based on an innovative multi-method study of a day centre in London for young homeless people, the book contextualizes spaces of homelessness within the social relations and flows of people that produce the world city. The book considers how the biographical and everyday trajectories of young homeless people intersect with place attachments and forms of governance to produce urban homeless spaces. It provides a new angle on the city made by movement, foregrounding the impact of mobilities shaped by loss, violence and the search for opportunity. The book draws on mental <b>maps,</b> <b>photography,</b> interviews and observation in order to produce an engaging and rich ethnographic account of young homeless people in the city...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Following {{decades of}} rapid {{urbanization}} in Africa, national governments are increasingly becoming overwhelmed by challenges posed by cities. Urban policy interventions {{over the years}} have usually excluded issues on the environment, particularly that of green spaces. As a result, urban environments in many countries have quickly degenerated. A typical case is that of Kumasi, Ghana s second largest city. Once celebrated as the Garden City of West Africa in the 1950 s, the city s population has more than tripled in the last three decades, resulting in the decimation of its green spaces, and an erosion of its Garden City image. This study set out to investigate the causes behind the decimation of Kumasi s green spaces and to offer recommendations on how it could re-emerge as an ecological city. The research approach to this interdisciplinary study was largely qualitative. Semi-structured questionnaires were used to interview representatives of agencies in the public, private, and traditional sectors of the city. A limited number of user-surveys were also conducted. The interviews were preceded by an appraisal of the physical problems using <b>mapping,</b> <b>photography,</b> and observation. Problems identified included: decimation of riparian vegetations and street trees; undeveloped neighbourhood open spaces; anddeterioration of regional facilities under public sector management. On the whole, the institutional problems behind these phenomena were found to have stemmed from political neglect as well as problems in the overall administration and spatial management mechanisms in the city. Specifically, the problems included the absence of a comprehensive management plan, inadequate institutional capacity, lack of judicial support system, lapses in land administration, lack of community participation, and poor collaboration among cognate agencies. Consequently, recommendations were made to enhance the efficiency of the management process for green spaces in the city. Beyond these, the need for renewed political commitment to green space issues, collaboration between the traditional and political institutions, and the speedy implementation of Ghana s decentralisation process have been emphasized as equally vital to Kumasi s ecological futur...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{intensification}} {{is one of}} the key planning {{strategies of}} the early twenty-first century, but proposals for intensification projects in established urban places are frequently resisted by community members on the basis that they would be;out of character'. Through empirical research in Australia, Canada, Great Britain and the United States, this study sets out to understand the factors underlying this resistance and to look at how the character of a place might be enhanced, rather than damaged, by the process of intensification. Case studies are undertaken in four places where the existing character was perceived as threatened by community members, or where the design and development of an urban intensification project was shaped by conceptions of that character. In the diverse inner-London district of Dalston, there was fierce resistance to intensification in defence of character. In the low-income Californian neighbourhood of Fruitvale, intensification was shaped by conceptions of 'Latino' character. In the inner-Perth suburb of Subiaco, there was an attempt by planners to reflect a highly-valued existing character, but the resulting intensification project encountered resident resistance nonetheless. In the low-density Vancouver suburb of Collingwood, the design of a high-rise project was shaped by a collaborative vision of desired neighbourhood character. The meanings of character, the reasons for resistance to change, and the way that processes of urban planning and design were able, or unable, to respond to those meanings and concerns are explored in each place. The approach to empirical research combines semi-structured interviews, discourse analysis, focus-group sessions, morphological <b>mapping,</b> <b>photography</b> and observational analysis. Resident conceptions of character in the four places are found to be based mostly in social measures and everyday experiences of place, and resistance to change is usually linked to concerns about social change or a loss of place-distinctiveness. In some cases, the existing character of a place was reinforced by intensification, in others new character was created. In all four cases, the question of whether character had been enhanced or damaged as a result of intensification was a subject of considerable debate.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to contribute}} to the debate on informal or popular settlements by viewing them as an opportunity to understand different ways of seeing and thinking about the city. Open spaces in popular settlements, like the housing stock, are to a large extent the product of local self-help and self-managed processes, however, the equivalent level of understanding has not been achieved, partly because they are often seen as spare spaces with little value. Open spaces in popular settlements are public in terms of ownership and accessibility, but are communal in terms of use and attachment. They {{play an important role in}} the physical and social dynamics of the barrios since their inception, however the improvement and consolidation of such spaces may not be realised for many years. The aim of this research is to investigate open spaces in the barrios, exploring ideas of production of informal urban space, functional and symbolic consumption, and the language and meaning that these places may convey. The research examines the subject in Bogotá, focusing on three questions: 1) How is open space designed, built, managed, transformed and sustained? 2) What is the relationship between open spaces and the people (users) who create them? 3) What is the form and design language used and how can it be understood and interpreted? The research draws on empirical data from 57 case studies of open space in the barrios of Bogotá collected between 2003 and 2007. Six cases were selected to explore in greater depth during further fieldwork. A qualitative methodology was employed, with a case study approach and a multi-method strategy: semi–structured interviews, observation, <b>mapping,</b> <b>photography,</b> photo elicitation and documentary sources. Based on the general and specific cases, the thesis contributes to an understanding of popular settlements as a way of thinking and developing cities in Latin America, and open spaces as tools of urban and social consolidation. The thesis concludes that open spaces are not „additional‟ areas in the settlements; on the contrary, they are fundamental and hold functional and symbolic uses from the early stages. It also argues that the processes of production and consumption of open spaces are closely interrelated, and help explain the design language found in the barrios, as well as contribute to build meanings for individuals and communities.
