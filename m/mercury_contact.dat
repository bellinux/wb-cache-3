Due to health and safety considerations brine is sometimes used today in place of mercury. The interaction of the current with the magnetic field of a U-magnet causes the wheel to rotate.

50|$|Davy {{published}} Outline of a New Plan of Telegraphic Communication in 1836 {{and carried}} out telegraphic experiments the following year. He demonstrated {{the operation of the}} telegraph over a mile of wire in Regent's Park. In 1837 he demonstrated a working model of the telegraph in Exeter Hall. He was granted a patent for his telegraph in 1838. However, he was soon obliged to drop his investigations of telegraphy for personal reasons. His patent was purchased by the Electric Telegraph Company in 1847 for £600. Davy also invented an electric relay. He used a magnetic needle which dipped into a <b>mercury</b> <b>contact</b> when an electric current passed through the surrounding coil. In recognition of this he was elected in 1885 as an honorary member of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and was informed of this by telegraph shortly before his death.|$|E

50|$|In 1800 Alessandro Volta {{invented the}} voltaic pile, {{allowing}} for a continuous current of electricity for experimentation. This became a source of a low-voltage current {{that could be used}} to produce more distinct effects, and which was far less limited than the momentary discharge of an electrostatic machine, which with Leyden jars were the only previously known man-made sources of electricity. Another very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an 'electrochemical telegraph' created by the German physician, anatomist and inventor Samuel Thomas von Sömmering in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish polymath and scientist Francisco Salva Campillo. Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von Sömmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each digit of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message. This is in contrast to later telegraphs that used a single wire (with ground return). Hans Christian Ørsted discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field which will deflect a compass needle. In the same year Johann Schweigger invented the galvanometer, with a coil of wire around a compass, which could be used as a sensitive indicator for an electric current. In 1821, André-Marie Ampère suggested that telegraphy could be done by a system of galvanometers, with one wire per galvanometer to indicate each letter, and said he had experimented successfully with such a system. In 1824, Peter Barlow said that such a system only worked to a distance of about 200 ft, and so was impractical. In 1825 William Sturgeon invented the electromagnet, with a single winding of uninsulated wire on a piece of varnished iron, which increased the magnetic force produced by electric current. Joseph Henry improved it in 1828 by placing several windings of insulated wire around the bar, creating a much more powerful electromagnet which could operate a telegraph through the high resistance of long telegraph wires. During his tenure at The Albany Academy from 1826 to 1832, Henry first demonstrated the theory of the 'magnetic telegraph' by ringing a bell through a mile of wire strung around the room. In 1835 Joseph Henry and Edward Davy invented the critical electrical relay. Davy's relay used a magnetic needle which dipped into a <b>mercury</b> <b>contact</b> when an electric current passed through the surrounding coil. This allowed a weak current to switch a larger current to operate a powerful local electromagnet over very long distances. Davy demonstrated his telegraph system in Regent's Park in 1837 and was granted a patent on 4 July 1838. He also developed an electric relay.|$|E

40|$|Mercury Porosimetry (MP) {{hysteresis}} is {{a commonly}} observed phenomenon in which mercury retention disguises further the overall hysteresis picture. This article introduces a new {{interpretation of the}} MP hysteresis based on the combined effect of pore structure networking and <b>mercury</b> <b>contact</b> angle variation occurring between the mercury penetration and retraction operations, To distinguish the contribution of each factor the following investigations were carried out. Nitrogen sorption (NP) and MP experiments were performed on samples of an anodic aluminum membrane {{and the results were}} interpreted in terms of the Corrugated Pore Structure Model (CPSM), i. e,, CPSM-Nitrogen and CPSM-Mercury models, respectively. The simulation of the observed hysteresis data using the CPSM model enabled the evaluation of an identical for the two methods intrinsic pore size distribution (PSD) and cumulative surface area in perfect agreement with the respective BET value. Additionally, the CPSM analysis of data resulted in the evaluation of <b>mercury</b> <b>contact</b> angles, i. e., theta (p) = 143 degrees and theta (r) = 101. 7 degrees for the MP penetration and retraction branches of the hysteresis loop, respectively. Moreover, CPSM-Mercury simulations of literature MP hysteresis data, valid for controlled-pore glasses and nuclepore membranes, led to the evaluation of contact angles, i. e., glasses: theta (p) = 143 degrees, theta (r) = 100. 5 - 107. 5 degrees and nuclepore: theta (p) = 143 degrees, theta (r) = 118 - 121 degrees. The latter values are comparable with relevant literature data and approximate those determined for the anodic aluminum membrane.

The latter is controlled by using Si(111) /H surfaces modified by dense mixed alkyl/acid-terminated monolayers with variable fraction of the acid grafting sites from 5 to 100 % in solution. Quantitative X-ray photoemission analysis, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and scanning tunnelling microscopy indicate a covalent attachment of a submonolayer to densely packed monolayer of Re 6 Se 8 clusters, while the vibrational Raman signature confirms the cluster integrity within the monolayer. Electrical band gaps as deduced from scanning tunnelling spectroscopy have been obtained for low Re 6 Se 8 cluster coverage. Using ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, electronic properties such as ionization potential changes and energy level alignments at organic/inorganic interfaces are studied. We show that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the Re 6 Se 8 cluster is close to the bottom of the Si conduction band. At high cluster coverage, this affects the current-voltage characteristics measured using a weakly interacting top <b>mercury</b> <b>contact</b> onto the organic monolayer/silicon junctions. Indeed, on n-type silicon, the high level current at low bias and the shape of the conductance G(V) curve indicate a Schottky barrier height lowering. On the other hand, the current-voltage characteristics are the same for both acid-terminated and low coverage Re 6 Se 8 cluster junctions at low bias; the high Schottky barrier height limits the current at low bias. When the forward bias increases, the current is tunnelling limited. As expected from the band alignment deduced from photoemission data, the opposite behavior is obtained on p-type silicon...|$|E
40|$|Bioreactive {{surfaces}} are seminal to the fabrication of semiconductor-based biochip devices. Their efficient preparation by {{the reaction of}} silicon with organic molecules, and the characterization of the formed monolayer films with spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques were the main objectives of the research described in this thesis. For {{the formation of a}} carboxy-terminated monolayer on silicon the conventional protocol consists of two steps: thermally or photochemically initiated reaction of an ester (CH 2 =CH(CH 2) xCOOR) with hydrogen-terminated silicon (111) and subsequent hydrolysis. Vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopic {{studies have shown that the}} ester hydrolysis is incomplete and disrupts the molecular orientation of the monolayer structure. Searching for a more direct route to bioreactive silicon surfaces, the kinetics of photochemical reactions of silicon with various organic molecules were investigated. It was found that under UV irradiation, alkenes react much faster than alkanoic acids. Therefore, the reaction of bifunctional molecules can be controlled to preferentially attach the alkene terminus to the silicon surface. Such a one-step reaction eliminates the complications encountered during ester hydrolysis. Studies of DNA monolayers immobilized on silicon revealed that their molecular orientation depends on the DNA-cation affinity: during immobilization of single-stranded DNA, the perturbation of molecular orientation of the monolayer occurred in the order Mg 2 + > Ca 2 + > K+ ~ Na+, whereas, during hybridization, disruption of the monolayer occurred in the order K+ ~ Na+ > Mg 2 + ~ Ca 2 +. A reliable metal contact on top of organically modified silicon is vital for solid-state electrical measurements. The thermal and sputtering metal deposition protocols have been assessed with SFG spectroscopy and by the electrical characterizations; the deposited gold penetrated and damaged the monolayers in both cases. Therefore, a device using a mercury drop electrode was designed and tested with the hydrogen terminated and the decane monolayer on silicon (111). The J-V curves proved that the <b>mercury</b> <b>contact</b> preserved the monolayer. Furthermore, the capabilities of the device to reveal electrical properties such as effective barrier height and ideality factor in relation to the molecular structures of ω-functionalized monolayers have been demonstrated.

40|$|Five {{different}} methods were critically examined {{to characterize the}} pore structure of the silica monoliths. The mesopore characterization was performed using: a) the classical BJH method of nitrogen sorption data, which showed overestimated values in the mesopore distribution and was improved by using the NLDFT method, b) the ISEC method implementing the PPM and PNM models, which were especially developed for monolithic silicas, that contrary to the particulate supports, demonstrate the two inflection points in the ISEC curve, enabling the calculation of pore connectivity, a measure for the mass transfer kinetics in the mesopore network, c) the mercury porosimetry using a new recommended <b>mercury</b> <b>contact</b> angle values. rnThe results of the characterization of mesopores of monolithic silica columns by the three methods indicated that all methods were useful {{with respect to the}} pore size distribution by volume, but only the ISEC method with implemented PPM and PNM models gave the average pore size and distribution based on the number average and the pore connectivity values. rnThe characterization of the flow-through pore was performed by two {{different methods}}: a) the mercury porosimetry, which was used not only for average flow-through pore value estimation, but also the assessment of entrapment. It was found that the mass transfer from the flow-through pores to mesopores was not hindered in case of small sized flow-through pores with a narrow distribution, b) the liquid penetration where the average flow-through pore values were obtained via existing equations and improved by the additional methods developed according to Hagen-Poiseuille rules. The result was that not the flow-through pore size influences the column bock pressure, but the surface area to volume ratio of silica skeleton is most decisive. Thus the monolith with lowest ratio values will be the most permeable. rnThe flow-through pore characterization results obtained by mercury porosimetry and liquid permeability were compared with the ones from imaging and image analysis. All named methods enable a reliable characterization of the flow-through pore diameters for the monolithic silica columns, but special care should be taken about the chosen theoretical model. rnThe measured pore characterization parameters were then linked with the mass transfer properties of monolithic silica columns. As indicated by the ISEC results, no restrictions in mass transfer resistance were noticed in mesopores due to their high connectivity. The mercury porosimetry results also gave evidence that no restrictions occur for mass transfer from flow-through pores to mesopores in the small scaled silica monoliths with narrow distribution. rnThe prediction of the optimum regimes of the pore structural parameters for the given target parameters in HPLC separations was performed. It was found that a low mass transfer resistance in the mesopore volume is achieved when the nominal diameter of the number average size distribution of the mesopores is appr. an order of magnitude larger that the molecular radius of the analyte. The effective diffusion coefficient of an analyte molecule in the mesopore volume is strongly dependent on the value of the nominal pore diameter of the number averaged pore size distribution. The mesopore size has to be adapted to the molecular size of the analyte, in particular for peptides and proteins. rnThe study on flow-through pores of silica monoliths demonstrated that the surface to volume of the skeletons ratio and external porosity are decisive for the column efficiency. The latter is independent from the flow-through pore diameter. The flow-through pore characteristics by direct and indirect approaches were assessed and theoretical column efficiency curves were derived. The study showed that next to the surface to volume ratio, the total porosity and its distribution of the flow-through pores and mesopores have a substantial effect on the column plate number, especially as the extent of adsorption increases. The column efficiency is increasing with decreasing flow through pore diameter, decreasing with external porosity, and increasing with total porosity. Though this tendency has a limit due to heterogeneity of the studied monolithic samples. We found that the maximum efficiency of the studied monolithic research columns could be reached at a skeleton diameter of ~ 0. 5 µm. Furthermore when the intention is to maximize the column efficiency, more homogeneous monoliths should be prepared. rnEs wurde fünf verschiedene, physikalisch-chemische Methoden zur Charakterisierung der Porenstruktur von Silica Monolithen angewandt und ihre Ergebnisse kritisch evaluiert, insbesondere im Hinblick auf die Trennleistung monolithischer Säulen in der HPLC. rnEs wurden drei verschiedenen Methoden für die Charakterisierung der Porenstruktur der Mesoporen von Silica Monolithen (mittlerer Porendurchmesser 2 > 50 nm) von Silica Monolithen und ihre Ergebnisse evaluiert.

Das heißt, dass für die Trennung von Peptiden und erst recht von Proteinen entsprechend große Mesoporen oder sogar Makroporen im Monolithen vorhanden sein müssen. rnIm Hinblick auf die Trennleistung von monolithischen Säulen ist nicht der durchschnittliche Durchflußporendurchmesser entscheidend, sondern das Oberflächen- zu Volumenverhältnis des Kiesegelgerüstes, das die Mesoporen enthält, sowie die Porosität der Makroporen und Mesoporen entscheidend sind Die Trennleistung nimmt zu mit abnehmendem Durchmesser der Durchflußporen, abnehmender Porosität der Durchflußporen und mit zunehmender Gesamtporosität des Monolithen.

Toward that end, we have explored the utility of chemically bonded hydrocarbon monolayers. Alkylated Ge(111) surfaces have been prepared by addition of 1 -alkenes to the H-terminated Ge(111) surface as well as by a two-step halogenation/alkylation procedure. The chemical compositions of the resulting methyl-, ethyl-, and decyl-terminated surfaces have been evaluated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Thermal addition of 1 -decene produced hydrophobic surfaces with 0. 3 ± 0. 1 monolayer of Ge oxide detected by XPS, whereas no oxide was observed on the methyl-, ethyl-, or decyl-terminated surfaces that were prepared using the two-step halogenation/alkylation method. Methyl-terminated Ge(111) surfaces prepared by the two-step method displayed a well-resolved C 1 s XPS peak at a binding energy of 284 eV, consistent with carbon bonded to a less electronegative element such as Ge. The electronic properties of all of the alkylated surfaces were characterized by measurements of the surface recombination velocity as a function of an externally applied gate voltage. Treatment of HF-etched Ge(111) surfaces with Br 2 vapor, followed by reaction with alkylmagnesium or alkyllithium reagents, yielded air-stable surfaces that had surface recombination velocities of 100 cm s^(− 1) or less under flat-band conditions.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) conﬁrms that the area concentration of surface-bound carbon on CH 3 -Ge(111) surfaces is equal to that of CH 3 -Si(111) surfaces. Other passivation methods were less successful. Every atop Ge atom of an ideal CH 3 -Ge(111) should be capped and the Ge-C bonds should be directed normal to the surface plane. Infrared absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) of methyl-terminated surfaces prepared from HF-etched precursors did not display distinguishable absorption peaks, but if the Ge substrate is ﬁrst treated with an anisotropic etch before the HF etch, IRAS conﬁrms the methyl group orientation with the polarization-dependent “umbrella” mode absorption at 1232 cm− 1 and a polarization-independent rocking mode at 755 cm− 1. Well-ordered CH 3 -Ge(111) surfaces displayed less surface charging while maintaining the low SRVs, indicating that such surfaces are successfully passivated. ...|$|R

50|$|Aluminium in air is ordinarily {{protected}} by a molecule-thin layer of its own oxide. This aluminium oxide layer serves as a protective barrier to the underlying aluminium itself and preventing chemical reactions with the metal. <b>Mercury</b> coming into <b>contact</b> with it does no harm. However, if any elemental aluminium is exposed (even by a recent scratch), the mercury may combine with it to form the amalgam. This process can continue well beyond the immediately exposed metal surface, potentially reacting with {{a large part of}} the bulk aluminium before it finally ends.|$|R
40|$|Abstract— <b>Mercury</b> in <b>contact</b> {{with oxygen}} is rapidly {{removed from the}} gas phase when {{irradiated}} with the 253. 7 run resonance line. The final, steady‐state concentration of mercury depends on the total pressure, the mol % of oxygen, and the presence (or absence) of mercury droplets in the reaction cell. The effect of oxygen on the mercury photosensitized formation of allene from methylenecyclobutane and trans‐ 2 ‐butene from cis‐ 2 ‐butene at room temperature was investigated. After correction for competitive quenching, collisional deactivation of the excited methylenecyclobutane, and decreased absorption (due to mercury depletion), the maximum decrease in the allene yield was only 12. 3 %. This decrease could be caused by the reaction of oxygen atoms or ozone with the product allene. In most of the experiments with mercury‐oxygen‐cis‐ 2 ‐butene mixtures, the corrected quantum yield of the trans‐isomer is unchanged from the yield {{in the absence of}} oxygen (0. 50). Thus oxygen cannot be used to detect the participation of triplet state molecules in mercury photosensitized reactions. Copyright © 1978, Wiley Blackwell.
