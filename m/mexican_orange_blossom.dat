50|$|Neroli oil is an {{essential}} oil produced from the blossom of the bitter orange tree (Citrus aurantium subsp. amara or Bigaradia). Its scent is sweet, honeyed and somewhat metallic with green and spicy facets. <b>Orange</b> <b>blossom</b> is also extracted from the same blossom and both extracts are extensively used in perfumery. <b>Orange</b> <b>blossom</b> {{can be described as}} smelling sweeter, warmer and more floral than neroli. The difference between how neroli and <b>orange</b> <b>blossom</b> smell and why they are referred to with different names, {{is a result of the}} process of extraction that is used to obtain the oil from the blooms. Neroli is extracted by steam distillation and <b>orange</b> <b>blossom</b> is extracted via a process of enfleurage.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A 31 -year-old atopic {{subject with}} {{allergic}} rhinoconjunctivitis with sensitization to several pollens, presented with urticaria and angioedema after ingestion of <b>orange</b> <b>blossom</b> pollen (Citrus sinensis). A positive {{skin prick test}} for <b>orange</b> <b>blossom</b> pollen extract (BIAL-Aristegui, Bilbao, Spain) at a concentration of 1. 2 mg/ml was obtained. Serum specific IgE antibodies to <b>orange</b> <b>blossom</b> pollen were shown (Unicap Pharmacia System, Uppsala, Sweeden). A conjunctival provocation test was negative with <b>orange</b> <b>blossom</b> pollen extract dilutions of 1 : 1000, 1 : 100 and 1 : 10 w/v. We describe a patient with an IgE-mediated reaction caused by hypersensitivity to <b>orange</b> <b>blossom</b> pollen. Although the pollen is an aeroallergen and the way of sensitization and entrance is the airway, and therefore the symptoms appear in this location, when contact is through some other route such as the digestive tract, it is also able to sensitize reporting urticaria and angioedema like in our case, instead of respiratory symptoms...|$|R
