50|$|Coffee {{is being}} {{cultivated}} between 700 m to 1300 m {{above sea level}} in fertile, loam to infertile gravel mixed soil in Waling area {{and other parts of}} Syangja district. The largest orchard in the district has 4000 plants and in others the number of plants ranges from 100 to 400. The common varieties of coffee grown in the area are Bourbon, Pacamara, Caturra and Yellow Caturra. Most of the coffee plantations in Syangja district have shades provided by already existing indigenous fruits and fodder plants as Sal, Katush, Chilaune, Nivaro, Badhar, Bedulo, Tote, Khaniya, Mayal, Kimbu, Suntala, Nibua, Amba, Kera, Mewa, Rukh katahar, Naspati, Aaru, Anar. Imported plants as Ipil-ipil, Rai grass, Dadab have also been used as shade plants. The coffee is organically grown and plants such as garlic, chinaberry, neem, siam weed, stinging nettle, smart weed, mug wart, prickly ash, <b>malabar</b> <b>nut</b> <b>tree,</b> marry gold and tobacco plant are usually used to prepare plant based organic pesticides for managing insects and diseases as a local solution. The relatively serious and common diseases identified in the plantation were Anthracnose (Collectotrichum gloeosporioides Penz.), Brown eye spot (Cercospora coffeicola), Damping off (Rhizoctonia solani), and Wilt disease (Fusarium spp.). Other minor diseases like sooty mould and algal spots have also been reported. Common insect pests in the orchard were white stem borer, red stem borer, green scale, mealy bugs, aphids, Snail, grasshopper, hopper, hairy caterpillar, case worm and tortoise beetles. A number of organizations like DCPA, CoPP HELVETAS, DADO and other local non-governmental organizations are providing support to the coffee farmers in the area.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{regeneration}} of Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> {{depends on}} tree-fall {{gaps in the}} forest. However, shifting cultivation fallows also create comparable biotic and abiotic opportunities for the dispersion and establishment of this gap-loving species. At the same time, the ability of Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> to resprout enables fallow individuals to survive successive slash-and-burn cycles. Recognizing the importance of shifting cultivation for the food security of forest dwellers, we investigated whether {{the high level of}} Brazil nut regeneration found in cultivation fallows could be explained by the resprouting capability of Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees,</b> the number of cultivation cycles, past agricultural use and distance to the nearest conspecific productive adults. We found that the Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>tree</b> population density increased from 8. 86 treesha− 1 to 13. 69 treesha− 1 and 27. 09 treesha− 1 at sites after one, two and three or more shifting cultivation cycles, respectively. As a consequence of resprouting, after a certain number of shifting cultivation cycles, the fallows become dominated by Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees,</b> and the landholders may decide to preserve them and to exclude enriched sites from future agricultural use. Protected for their extractive value, the secondary forests spontaneously enriched with Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> are allowed to develop into nut-producing forests that have reduced chances of conversion into crops or pastures, thus reversing the classical process of Amazon forest degradation...|$|R

40|$|In the State of Acre, the Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>tree,</b> Bertholletia excelsa (Lecythidaceae), is {{classified}} {{by the local}} population into two types according to morphological characteristics, including color and quality of wood, shape of the trunk and crown, and fruit production. We examined the reliability of this classification by comparing morphological and molecular data of four populations of Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> from Vale do Rio Acre in the Brazilian Amazon. For the morphological analysis, we evaluated qualitative and quantitative information of the trees, fruits, and seeds. The molecular analysis was performed using RAPD and ISSR markers, with cluster analysis. Significant {{differences were found between}} the two types of Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> for the characters diameter at breast height, fruit yield, fruit size, and number of seeds per fruit. Despite the significant correlation between the morphological characteristics and the popular classification, we observed all possible combinations of morphological characteristics in both types of Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees.</b> In some individuals, the classification did not correspond to any of the characteristics. The results obtained with molecular markers showed that the two locally classified types of Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> did not differ genetically, indicating that there is no consistent separation between them...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} {{multiple}} forest management systems is contingent {{on a variety}} of social, economic, biophysical, and institutional factors, including the integration of timber and non-timber forest product (NTFP) extraction and management. Selective logging for timber is increasingly taking place in forests where the collection of Brazil nuts, a high-value Amazonian NTFP, also occurs. We report on logging damage to Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> in three certified timber concessions in Northern Bolivia from which timber is harvested using reduced-impact logging (RIL) guidelines and nuts are gathered yearly from the ground by local people. Observed frequencies of logging damage to Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> were low, likely mirroring the low intensity of timber harvesting (0. 5 trees/ha and 5 m 3 /ha) being currently applied across the study area. Of the trees 10 cm in diameter at breast height about 0. 1 Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> and 0. 4 timber species per hectare suffered some degree of logging damage. Crown loss was the predominant damage type for Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> accounting for 50 % of all damage. In spite of the observed low rates of tree damage, we further recommend that RIL guidelines be amended to include the pre-harvest marking of prereproductive Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> along with the future crop trees of commercial timber species. Further refining directional felling to reduce crown damage to Brazil <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> would also serve to helpmaintain nut yields in the long term...|$|R

Female bees of Xylocopa frontalis(Olivier) and males of Eulaema mocsaryi (Friese) are apparently effective pollinators of Couratari in igapó near Manaus. Female bees of Euplusia seabrai Moure in litt., Epicharis umbraculata (Fabricius), Epicharis rustica (Olivier) and Eulaema nigrita(Lepeletier), {{as well as}} male bees of Eulaema cingulata(Fabricius) and Eulaema nigrita are apparently effective pollinators of adult Brazil <b>Nut</b> <b>trees</b> in the Aleixo plantation near Manaus. Only large bees capable of uncurling the floral androecium can effectively pollinate Couratari or Bertholletia. Pollen analysis indicated that all bees captured carried pollen of the host tree in question and had been foraging on flowers of plant species common in secondary growth. Secondary growth near the Aleixo plantation supports a bee guild which appeared to effectively pollinate almost every flower on the Brazil <b>Nut</b> <b>tree</b> studied. Proximity to primary forest (and to those Euglossine bee species which occur only in primary forest) therefore {{does not appear to}} be necessary for pollination of Brazil <b>Nut</b> <b>trees.</b> In the Aleixo plantation chronic low fruit set is probably due to some factor other than pollination.

40|$|Betel nut or {{betel palm}} (Areca catechu Linn) {{has become a}} major cash crop in {{southern}} and central Taiwan since the mid- 1980 s. Many slopeland fruit orchards and forests have been converted to betel nut plantations. The total area of betel nut plantations has increased over the past 30 years, reaching a peak of 56 542 ha in 1997. The public and conservation groups frequently express great concern over the potential negative hydrological impacts of betel nut plantations oil steep slopes. This investigation in central Taiwan examines the effects of hillslope betel nut plantations on hydrological processes. Differences in hydrological characteristics between plots planted with betel <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> and those with other ground cover types were evaluated at two study sites. The tall, single-layer canopy and wide spacing between planted betel <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> led to low interception losses, high throughfall and high net rainfall. Plots planted with betel <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> had lower infiltration, higher surface runoff and higher erosion than forested sites. These hydrological characteristics can be related to factors such as crown cover, soil organic content and soil porosity in betel nut plantations. Strearnflow data from three gauged watersheds with different proportions of total area planted with betel nut showed that where greater proportions of total area were planted with betel <b>nut</b> <b>trees,</b> there were higher annual stream flow/rainfall ratios, higher specific peak flows, steeper recessions and higher peak flow/baseflow ratios. The results from this study suggest that, in general, betel <b>nut</b> <b>trees</b> are less desirable from the soil and water conservation viewpoints than natural forests...|$|R
