The third person limited point of view shifts protagonists every time a character comes into contact with a certain shade of red nail polish, Million Dollar Red. According to Quynh, the owner of the salon, the polish has the magical power to give women what they need but not what they want. Once the six women have encountered the color, the narrative rotates through their lives, alternating between manicurist and client. Each client enters the salon with a personal conflict, but this conflict changes with the application of the red polish and the interaction with the manicurist. In the backdrop, the manicurists struggle with the central conflict: the impending health inspection. Million Dollar Red exaggerates the differences and similarities of the women in Eastside San Jose, pitting their cultural stereotypes against each other comically, ironically, and sometimes tragically. The women, propelled by a desire to be at least a little different from who they are, find themselves driven towards each other, and in some cases, realize that they do want essentially the same things, no matter where they come from...|$|R

40|$|Background: Intramedullary nails for {{stabilizing}} intertrochanteric proximal femoral fractures {{have been}} available since the early 1990 <b>s.</b> The <b>nails</b> are inserted percutaneously and have theoretical mechanical advantages over plates and screws, {{but they have not}} been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes. Still, use of intramedullary nails is becoming more common. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine trends in the use and associated outcomes of intramedullary nailing compared with sliding hip screws in Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals. Methods: Review of the VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) data identified 5244 male patients in whom an intertrochanteric proximal femoral fracture had been treated in a VA hospital between 1998 and 2005. The overall sample was used to assess trends in device use, thirty-day mortality, thirty-day surgical complications, and one-year mortality. Next, propensity score matching methods were used to compare 1013 patients identified as having been treated with an intramedullary nail with 1013 patients who had a sliding-screw procedure. Multiple logistic regression models for the matched sample were used to calculate odds ratios for mortality and complications according to the choice of internal fracture fixation. Results: Use of intramedullary nails in VA facilities increased from 1998 through 2005 and varied by geographic region. Unadjustedmortality and complication percentages were similar for the two procedures, with approximately 8 % of patients dying within thirty days after surgery, 28 % dying within one year, and 19 % having at least one perioperative complication. While the choice of an intramedullary nail or sliding-screw procedure was related to the geographic region, year of surgery, surgeon characteristics, and several patient characteristics, it was not associated with thirty-day outcomes in either the descriptive or the multiple regression analysis...|$|R

40|$|Why {{was this}} article {{selected}} {{as a classic}} orthopaedic reference? Despite the revolutionary work by Küntscher in the 1930 <b>s,</b> closed intramed-ullary <b>nailing</b> techniques were only slowly introduced in the United States. The clin-ical study by Winquist et al. documented the excellent results of nailing at an American trauma center and also offered multiple insights, based on careful obser-vations, {{on how to improve}} the tech-nique. Currently accepted concepts such as early fixation of long-bone fractures in multiply injured patients, immediate fix-ation of open fractures, use of the piri-formis fossa as an entry portal, limited reaming, and the value of interlocking screws were all identified in this seminal article. How has the information in the article withstood the “test of time”? The striking results of this study, which surpassed those provided by any other treatment technique, {{had a profound effect on}} the management of femoral shaft fractures in North America. In a preliminary 1971 report 1, the authors had noted a promising technique, but this large series was compelling evidence of its superiority over traction, cast-bracing, and open fixation. The article ushered in the era of intramedullary nailing and spawned numerous clinical and biome-chanical investigations in American trauma centers. The basic principles of closed nailing delineated in this study are valid today. How has our thinking changed with regard to this subject since the publi-cation of this landmark work? The relatively high rates of shortening and malrotation reported by the authors have been addressed over the last fifteen years by a remarkable growth in inter-locking nailing systems. Improvements in reamer and nail designs, reduction ma-neuvers, and retrograde nailing tech-niques have also been advocated. Closed intramedullary nailing of femoral frac-tures has remained one of the most pre-dictable and rewarding procedures in orthopaedic trauma care...|$|R
40|$|Removal of {{fracture}} fixation devices due to symptomatic or asymptomatic {{reasons is}} a costly procedure which is further increased when complications are encountered. One {{of the main}} difficulties faced by a surgeon is a timely and successful removal of the device due to excessive bone overgrowth. Due to the increased time required for removal of the bone from the device, complications such as increased surgery time, excessive blood loss, debris contamination and implant breakage are often encountered. Practically all internal fixation systems such as locking compression plate constructs, and intramedullary nails, are fabricated for clinics with a micro-rough surface. However, it is well known, that surface micro-topography can be {{a major factor in}} determining the type, and extent of tissue integration. Despite the knowledge that surface microtopography can be a major determinant of osseointegration, this avenue has only been investigated for applications requiring accelerated bony integration and has not previously been explored as a potential resolution to issues involving device removal. Thus, we hypothesise that reducing the surface micro-topography of clinically available materials will reduce the incidence of excessive bony over-growth, and consequently will ease implant removal. To investigate this hypothesis, we first characterised, using atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, contact angle, and white light profilometry, changes in the surface micro-topography of the clinically available materials commercially pure titanium (cpTi), titanium- 6 %aluminum- 7 %niobium (TAN), and titanium- 15 %molybdenum (Til 5 Mo) in their standard micro-rough form, as well as in their experimental electropolished, and paste polished form. Stainless steel (Ss) was included as the orthopaedic grade 'smooth 9 surface control. Additionally, we employed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to examine the changes, if any, in the chemical composition of the surfaces. Overall, it was shown that both electropolishing and paste polishing techniques were successful at reducing the micro-roughness of the respective materials, as well as producing a smoothened surface morphologically. As all surfaces were anodised subsequent to polishing, alterations in the surface chemical composition were not evident. Initial in vitro analysis, which involved culturing rat calvarial cells on the various surfaces, showed that surface polishing did not significantly influence cell growth compared to standard micro-rough counterparts. Furthermore, viability on these surfaces was not found to be significantly different from standard micro-rough samples, indicating that overall, surface polishing does not affect the cytocompatibility of cpTi, TAN or Til 5 Mo. However, paste polished TAN was found to be the exception. Specifically, viability was significantly reduced on this surface compared to standard micro-rough TAN. While cell growth was not significantly affected on paste polished TAN, it was observed that initial cell attachment for this surface was lower compared to standard micro-rough TAN. Fluorescent labelling of the cytoskeletal components actin, tubulin and vinculin revealed that cell morphology was differentially influenced by the various surface morphologies. Generally, polished surfaces advocated a more well spread, elongated phenotype compared to the cuboidal phenotype noted for cells cultured on micro-rough surfaces. Paste polished TAN and standard micro-rough TAN samples also showed some degree of cytoskeletal disruption attributable to the inherent presence of beta-phase particles on their surface. Subsequent analysis of genotype, using real time PCR technology, revealed that for cpTi, TAN and Til 5 Mo samples, surface polishing essentially provokes its influence in different manners at initial stages of differentiation and consequently then similarly at the later stages of terminal differentiation, and that the magnitude of this effect is material dependent [...] Subsequently, we applied surface polishing technology to two clinically relevant internal fixation systems, namely locking compression plates (LCP) and screws, and intramedullary nails (IM), to assess if surface polishing holds potential for reducing implant removal related morbidity. In our LCP model electropolished, paste polished and standard TAN cortical screws were evaluated in combination with electropolished, paste polished and standard cpTi plates, respectively, with stainless steel screws and plates included as a control system. Samples were implanted in a bilateral non-fracture sheep tibia model for 6, 12 and 18 months. At each timepoint, removal torque and percentage of bone contact were quantified for each screw type. Results indicate that both polishing techniques significantly reduce the torque removal required for cortical screws, compared to standard micro-rough cortical screws. Histomorphometric analyses indicated that polished constructs showed a trend for reduced bone contact, however, this was only found to be significantly different for paste polished screws. In our second in vivo model, IM nails fabricated from standard micro-rough TAN and paste polished TAN were implanted in a bilateral, non-fracture sheep model for 12 months. Control animals were implanted with <b>Ss</b> IM <b>nails</b> and standard micro-rough TAN IM nails in the contralateral tibia. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Cancer Research UK Formulation Unit The Formulation Unit {{based at}} the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow has a {{research}} and development history in excess of 25 years, being funded by, and working in partnership with, firstly Cancer Research Campaign, and since 2002, with Cancer Research UK. The Unit is based in an entirely academic University setting, and since 2004 has been licensed by the UK government Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for research, development and manufacture of Phase I/II novel small molecule cancer therapeutics and diagnostics. Research programs have delivered new formulations to clinical trial as either sterile or non-sterile presentations. However, the Unit’s specialty is based around small volume parenteral product manufacture. Boronophenylalanine (L-BPA) in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) L-BPA is the premier pharmaceutical selection in BNCT in treatment of selected head and neck tumours. BNCT relies on localisation of boron 10 within a tumour mass, {{made possible by the}} amino acid carrier portion of the L-BPA molecule. Phenylalanine is selectively transported across the blood brain barrier and then into astrocytic cells by a LAT- 1 transporter system that is up-regulated in tumour. A targeted external neutron beam activates the accumulated L-BPA. In brief, neutron capture by boron causes nuclear re-arrangement and formation of a high linear energy transfer alpha particle and lithium 7 nuclei. Thus the patient is dosed with localised radiotherapy. OLD FORMULATION Issues existed with the previous standard formulation of L-BPA in fructose. L-BPA complexed with fructose has low solubility of around 30 mg/mL. Consequently, large administration volumes are required to achieve clinical dosing in tens of grams of drug per patient. Moreover, L-BPA in fructose solutions must be freshly prepared and administered within 48 hours for reasons of product instability (Henriksson et al, 2008). Although rare, hereditary fructose intolerance needs to be considered. Taken together, L-BPA production, preparation and patient dosing is highly challenging. NEW FORMULATION Restrictions The Formulation Unit developed a new improved formulation; the drug product was a lyophilized pH 8 solution of L-BPA at 100 mg/mL in 110 mg/mL mannitol (Schmidt et al, 2011). When lyophilised, a shelf life of 48 months was supported for the drug product. Whilst a three times increase in solubility, and a significantly enhanced product lifetime were worthy formulation enhancements, a new restriction emerged; the solution for lyophilisation contained 21 % w/v solids far exceeding the ‘normal’ region of 2 % w/v to 5 % w/v (Boylan and Nail, 2009). Moreover, the lyophilisation cycle of 6 days was considered commercially unfavourable. A shortened drying cycle of 1 to 3 days would be preferred. Research was therefore initiated to reduce drying cycle time utilising Manometric Temperature Measurement (MTM) technology. MTM Studies MTM controlled freeze drying systems were originally marketed {{in the first decade of}} the new millennium. The ability to use software to calculate the performance at the freeze-drying front in real time is scientifically and commercially appealing. The possibility to optimize processing conditions at that same time as data is being received invites the prospect of a reduced experimentation phase thereby rapidly reaching the goal of a maximally efficient freeze drying cycle. In theory, even a minimally experienced operator could achieve this outcome. In summary, MTM functions by taking pressure rise information at regular intervals (Giesler et al, 2007). Based on SMART® software (SP Scientific, Stone Ridge, NY, USA), hourly pressure rise data are taken at a rate of 10 samples per second. The system calculates the product temperature at the sublimation interface and mass transfer resistance of the product. Adjustments are then automatically made to the shelf temperature and system pressure to achieve a calculated target product temperature. The end of primary drying can be determined by comparing the vapour pressure of ice with the system chamber pressure. Input data is minimal, such as vial number, inner vial area, fill volume and weight, concentration, product critical temperature. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals Syntagon AB, Södertälje, Sweden manufactured BPA raw material according to EU current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). D-mannitol (Ph. Eur) was sourced from Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK, and fuming hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide pellets (both extra pure Ph. Eur., BP, JP, NF) were obtained from VWR International, Lutterworth, UK. Water for Irrigation (WFI) in bulk was acquired from Baxter’s Healthcare Ltd., Norfolk, UK. Type 1 clear glass 50 mL vials with 20 mm butyl rubber stoppers (proved clean), crimped with 20 mm tear off aluminium overseals were all from Adelphi Healthcare Packaging, Haywards Heath, UK. Lyophilisation equipment MTM software (SMART®) was operated on an FTS Systems Lyostar II drier (Biopharma, Winchester, UK). CONCLUSION A new improved L-BPA formulation in mannitol has been developed and used in human clinical trial. Further research using MTM technology succeeded in reducing a 6 day drug product drying cycle to 53 hours. The formulation exhibited non-ideal behaviour, and MTM failed to predict drying parameters, e. g., base of vial temperature, that are more closely replicated in ‘ideal’ test articles such as a 5 % mannitol comparator. Further test lyophilisations are required to reach ideal. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research is funded by Cancer Research UK. REFERENCES 1. Boylan, J. C. and <b>Nail,</b> <b>S.</b> L.
