Growth poles (1970 s) and later VINEX {{locations}} (1990 – 2010) were the main components of growth management. Transport infrastructure has developed greatly since the 1920 s. Since 1990, infrastructure development has increasingly become the structuring force for the spatial dynamics of the Randstad. Schiphol was seen as the mainport for airlines, and Rotterdam-Europoort as the mainport for shipping lines and container transport. The landside infrastructural connections for Schiphol and Europoort had a big impact on the growth in the capacity of continental roads and rail lines. ICT- and energy infrastructure are now developing quickly. Recently, Amsterdam Internet Exchange became the largest ICT node in Europe. Finally, the Delta programme was introduced, strengthening the coastal areas and leaving more room for the rivers.

40|$|Late Miocene basaltic sills and dikes in the Paiute Ridge area of {{southern}} nevada show evidence that their emplacement was structurally controlled. Basaltic dikes {{in this area}} formed by dilating pre-existing vertical to steeply E-dipping normal faults. Magma propagation along these faults must have required less energy than {{the creation of a}} self-propagated fracture at dike tips and the magma pressure must have been greater than the compressive stress perpendicular to the fault surface. N- to NE-trending en echelon dikes formed locally and are not obviously attached to the three <b>main</b> <b>dikes</b> in the area. The en echelon segments are probably pieces of deeper dikes, which are segmented perhaps {{as a result of a}} documented rotation of the regional stresses. Alternatively, changes in orientation of principal stresses in the vicinity of each en echelon dike could have resulted from local loads associated with paleotopographic highs or nearby structures. Sills locally branched off some dikes within 300 m of the paleosurface. These subhorizontal bodies occur consistently in the hanging wall block of the dike-injected faults, and intrude Tertiary tuffs near the Paleozoic-Tertiary contact. The authors suggest that the change in stresses near the earth`s surface, the material strength of the tuff and paleozoic rocks, and the Paleozoic bedding dip direction probably controlled the location of sill formation and direction of sill propagation. The two largest sills deflected the overlying tuffs to form lopoliths, indicating that the magma pressure exceeded vertical stresses at that location and that the shallow level and large size of the sills allowed interaction with the free (earth`s) surface. 32 refs., 4 figs., 1 tab...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA Miocene age volcanic-hypabyssal {{structure}} comprising volcaniclastic deposits and mafic intrusions is exposed with vertical relief of ∼ 110 m {{on the side}} of Gergovie Plateau (Auvergne, France). Three main volcaniclastic facies are: (1) Fluidal tuff breccia composed of juvenile basalt and sediment clasts with dominantly fluidal shapes, with several combinations of basalt and sediment within individual clasts. (2) Thickly bedded lapilli tuff composed of varying proportions of fine-grained sediment derived from Oligocene–Miocene lacustrine marls and mudstones and basaltic lapilli, blocks, and bombs. (3) Planar-bedded tuff forming thin beds of fine to coarse ash-size sedimentary material and basalt clasts. Intrusive bodies in the thickly bedded lapilli tuff range from irregularly shaped and anastomosing dikes and sills of meters to tens of meters in length, to a <b>main</b> feeder <b>dike</b> that is up to ∼ 20 m wide, and that flares into a spoon-shaped sill at ∼ 100 m in diameter and 10 – 20 m thick {{in the eastern part of}} the structure. Volcaniclastic deposits and structural features suggest that ascending magma entrained soft, saturated sediment host material into the feeder dike and erupted fluidal magma and wet sediment via weak, Strombolian-like explosions. Host sediment and erupted material subsided to replace the extracted sediments, producing the growth subsidence structure that is similar to upper diatreme facies in typical maar diatremes but lacks evidence for explosive disruption of diatreme fill. Irregularly shaped small intrusions extended from the <b>main</b> feeder <b>dike</b> into the diatreme, and many were disaggregated due to shifting and subsidence of diatreme fill and recycled via eruption. The Mardoux structure is an “unconventional” maar diatreme in that it was produced mainly by weak explosive activity rather than by violent phreatomagmatic explosions and is an example of complex coupling between soft sediment and ascending magma...|$|R

40|$|The Henry Mountains {{of southeastern}} Utah are five {{topographic}} domes, {{each of which}} is a separate mid-Tertiary shallow crustal intrusive complex comprised of a cluster of component igneous intrusions. The intrusions were emplaced at shallow depths into flat-lying sedimentary strata of the Colorado Plateau. The lack of tectonic influence imposed on the intrusive bodies during or since emplacement makes the Henry Mountains an ideal place to study forceful magma emplacement in the shallow crust. This study focuses on the internal structure of the Mount Hillers intrusive complex which has an estimated igneous rock volume of approximately 35 km³. New geologic mapping demonstrates that the intrusive complex includes several component intrusions with distinct geometries. The largest component intrusion of the complex is a concordant, asymmetric laccolithic body with Permian sedimentary units contacting the southeastern roof and Jurassic sedimentary units contacting the northwestern roof. The different aged sedimentary units in contact with the upper portion of the main laccolithic body imply that the elevation of the base of the intrusion is not consistent within the stratigraphic section. The two areas with different-aged roof and floor units appear to be separated by a major but poorly exposed fault. Additionally, the main asymmetric laccolithic body appears to be directly attached to and likely once fed smaller laccolithic bodies on its northern perimeter. This improved understanding of the detailed internal structure of component laccolithic bodies of Mount Hillers provide constraints on the progressive developmental history of the intrusive complex. In the early stage of intrusive development, a network of sills and dikes was emplaced into subhorizontal strata. Next the <b>main</b> feeder <b>dike</b> of Mount Hillers (hypothesized to strike northeast) directly fed one southeast-radiating semicircular protolaccolith under Permian units. As the intrusion grew vertically, a fault may have developed parallel to and above the <b>main</b> feeder <b>dike</b> as the intrusion bent and uparched overlying host rock southeast of the fault. Once the intrusive body grew to a vertical thickness of ~ 1, 500 meters, magma may have started to intrude laterally beneath Jurassic units to the northwest. The main laccolithic body then continued to grow vertically, simultaneously lifting different aged sedimentary roof units that are separated by a large fault. Late in the intrusive history, several relatively small tongue-shaped laccolithic intrusions were fed from and grew adjacent to the northern margin of the main asymmetric laccolithic body of Mount Hillers. The Henry Mountains are where geologist G. K. Gilbert first recognized and documented that magma bodies can deform host rock. Gilbert used the term `laccolite' (later 'laccolith') to describe plutonic bodies that make space for themselves in the shallow crust by lifting and uparching overburden. Since Gilbert's early work, the Henry Mountains region {{has been the focus of}} considerable research on the geometry and growth of igneous intrusions in the shallow crust. The new work presented here reveals that intrusions that were once thought to be a clusters of separate igneous bodies may instead be an amalgamation of component laccolithic intrusions that make up a large and geometrically complex intrusive feature.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{proposal}} {{for the restoration of}} the Salton Sea, in California, consists of the separation of the lake into <b>main</b> lake and <b>diked</b> impoundment. It is expected that this will eventually reduce the salinity of the main lake, while increasing the salinity of the diked impoundment to that of a concentrated brine. A salinity-balance model is developed to simulate water volume and dissolved-solids concentration throughout the restoration period. Modeling shows that if water deliveries to the Salton Sea continue at recent historic levels, a 50 -sq mi (129. 5 km 2) diked impoundment will fill up with water in 12 years, and the dissolved-solid concentration in the main lake will decrease to only 44. 4 ppt. On the other hand, if a phased-in decrease of 200, 000 ac-ft yr− 1 (247 million m 3) is implemented as planned, the diked impoundment will fill up with salts in 66 years, without accomplishing any salinity reduction in the main lake. ...|$|R

5000|$|W.G. Witteveen, {{director}} of the Port Authority, was instructed to draw up plans for the reconstruction within four days of the bombing, and had presented his plan to the city council {{in less than a}} month. This first plan essentially used most of the old city’s structure and layout, but integrated into a new plan, with widened streets and sidewalks. The largest and most controversial change to the layout was to move the <b>main</b> <b>dike</b> of the city alongside the riverbank, so as to protect the low-lying Waterstad area from flooding. This was met with criticism from the newly formed ‘Inner Circle of Rotterdam Club’, who promoted integrating the city with the Maas River, and claimed the dike would create a marked separation from it.A number of new or previously incomplete projects - such as the Maastunnel and Rotterdamsche bank - were to be completed under Witteveen’s plan, and these kept the Dutch people in work during the German occupation of the city, until all construction was halted. Herman van der Horst’s 1952 documentary ‘Houen zo!’ presents a vision of some of these projects.During this time, Witteveen’s successor Cornelius van Traa drafted a completely new reconstruction plan - the ‘Basisplan voor de Herbouw van de Binnenstad,’ - which was adopted in 1946. Van Traa’s plan was a much more radical rebuild, doing away with the old layout and replacing them with a collection of principles rather than such a rigid structural design. The ‘Basisplan’ placed a high emphasis on broad open spaces and promoted the river’s special integration with the city through two significant elements; the Maas Boulevard, which re-imagined the newly moved dike as an 80m wide tree-lined street; and the [...] "Window to the River,’ a visual corridor running from the harbour to the centre of the city.

40|$|The rifting of {{the plate}} {{boundary}} in north Iceland forms new ground fissures and reactivates old ones. Continuous growth of fissures is observed in the crust above a magma chamber beneath the Krafla caldera as it responds to changes in subterranean magma pressure. Rapid episodes of fissure formation and reactivation are observed in conjunction with magma intrusions at depth along the rift zone that constitutes the plate boundary between the North American and Eurasian plates. The Krafla caldera contains several fissures that open during periods of uplift lasting 100 to 300 days and that close incompletely in subsidence episodes lasting several hours to 3 weeks. The average rate of opening differs from one period to another, ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 5 mm/d. Fissure closing and average closing rates also vary from one subsidence episode to another, ranging from minimal values of 2. 1 mm and 2. 3 mm/d to maximal values of 49 mm and 18 mm/d, respectively. During the two intrusion episodes of September 1977 and March 1980 the magma migrated toward the south with an average velocity 0. 6 and 0. 5 m/s, respectively. In the September 1977 episode some fissures in the rift zone widened with a rate greater than 190 mm/d, whereas during the March episode that probably resulted in a thinner intrusion the maximum widening rate was only 50 mm/d. The {{data suggest that the}} magnitude of a subsidence episode is determined at least partly by the available excess magma pressure in the chamber.

The 1707 Hoei earthquake compressed the basaltic magma reservoir and partly unclamped the <b>main</b> <b>dike,</b> especially in deeper regions, which might have uplifted sufficient basaltic magma to trigger magma mixing and the Plinian eruption 49  days after the Hoei earthquake (Chesley et al. 2012).

An accurate assessment of the breach evolution is a prerequisite to a sound flood risk assessment and management. in contrast, the current knowledge of the physical processes involved in fluvial dike failure by overtopping remains highly fragmented. This paper presents experimental tests on the breaching of homogenous sand-dikes in a fluvial configuration, i. e. the flow {{is parallel to the}} longitudinal dike axis. Overtopping is initiated over a pilot notch at the dike crest. Experiments are performed for different inflow discharges in the main channel and under different levels of floodplain confinement. The transient evolution of the dike geometry is monitored using a laser profilometry technique. The detailed reconstruction of the breach formation and expansion provides key insights into the mechanisms involved in the failure of fluvial dikes. Results show that the breach development differs highly from experiments disregarding the flow parallel to the dike axis (i. e. frontal configuration) as in the fluvial configuration the breach develops mainly in the flow direction and the floodplain water level strongly conditions the breach horizontal and vertical extent...|$|R
40|$|Eruptions are fed by dikes; therefore, better {{knowledge}} of dike propagation {{is necessary to}} improve {{our understanding of how}} magma is transferred and extruded at volcanoes. This study presents an overview of dike patterns and the factors controlling dike propagation within volcanic edifices. Largely based on published data, three <b>main</b> types of <b>dikes</b> (regional, circumferential and radial) are illustrated and discussed. Dike pattern data from 25 volcanic edifices in different settings are compared to derive semi-quantitative relationships between the topography (relief, shape, height, and presence of sector collapses) of the volcano, tectonic setting (presence of a regional stress field), and mean composition (SiO 2 content). The overview demonstrates how dike propagation in a volcano is not a random process; rather, it depends from the following factors (listed in order of importance) : the presence of relief, the shape of the edifice and regional tectonic control. We find that taller volcanoes develop longer radial dikes, whose (mainly lateral) propagation is independent of the composition of magma or the aspect ratio of the edifice. Future research, starting from these preliminary evaluations, should be devoted to identifying dike propagation paths and likely locations of vent formation at specific volcanoes, to better aid hazards assessment...|$|R
