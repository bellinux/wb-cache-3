Etching of lunar pyroxenes reveals deformation markings that are evidence of prior impact events. The soil microstratigraphic chronology can be derived if it is assumed that the minimum track density in a thin soil layer is commonly found in grains where such erasure was caused by the impact that deposited the soil. With Apollo 12 core samples as examples, the minimum track density found in each layer is used to calculate the longest exposure that layer could have received since it was last disturbed. By summing the upper limits on the exposure times of the different layers, a lower limit on the average deposition rate was estimated to be 0. 35 cm/m. y...|$|E
