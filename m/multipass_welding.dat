40|$|Welding is a reliable, cost effective, and {{efficient}} metal joining process. Manual {{metal arc welding}} (MMAW) is a widely used welding process in industry and <b>multipass</b> <b>welding</b> is very frequently used in the MMAW process. The temperature distribution that prevails during <b>multipass</b> <b>welding</b> affects the material microstructure and hardness of the regions near the weld, and the residual stresses that will {{be present in the}} material after cooling to room temperature. These changes will consequently affect the performance of the welded joint. In the present work, a computer model based on the control volume method has been developed to predict the temperature distribution during <b>multipass</b> <b>welding</b> of plates using the MMAW process. To validate the computer model, the temperature distribution was measured experimentally in a 12 mm thickness stainless steel weld pad during <b>multipass</b> <b>welding.</b> The welding parameters were used as input data for the computer model.

40|$|In {{the high}} cycle fatigue (HCF) regime, the fatigue {{strength}} of welded joints is influenced by residual stresses (RS) induced during welding processes. If the weld toe is modelled via a sharp V-notch, the dis- tribution of weld toe residual stress can {{be shown to be}} asymptotic with a singularity which follows either the linear-elastic or elastic-plastic solution depending on parameters that range across material properties, specimen clamping conditions, and the welding process. For thicker plates, <b>multipass</b> <b>welding</b> is used instead of single-pass welding to reduce the heat input and hence the width of the fusion zone (FZ) and heat-affected zone (HAZ). However, for a fixed plate thickness, the magnitude and extent of residual stresses near the weld toe will vary according to the number of passes used in the welding oper- ation. In this paper the influence of <b>multipass</b> <b>welding</b> on the residual stress field near the weld toe has been analysed using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques.

40|$|Through the {{combination}} of in-situ alloying and additive manufacturing with gas tungsten arc welding, {{a new approach to}} fabricating titanium aluminide alloys is proposed. This innovative and low cost process has many similarities to <b>multipass</b> <b>welding.</b> It has been a generally accepted practice to maintain a specified interpass temperature when <b>multipass</b> <b>welding</b> many different alloys to prevent defects such as cracks. Increasing the interpass temperature can facilitate phase transformation by extending the high temperature period and produce the desired weld microstructure. This study examines the influence of different interpass temperatures on in-situ alloyed and additively manufactured γ-TiAl alloy. The microstructure, chemical composition, phase constitution and microhardness of all the test components were respectively examined by using light microscopy, SEM-EDS, X-ray diffraction and a Duromain 70 Hardness Tester. No appreciable changes in microstructure and composition were found as interpass temperature was changed. However, as the interpass temperature was increased from 100 °C to 400 °C, a decrease of α 2 phase fraction was observed due to the lower cooling rate. Consequently, the microhardness value also decreased. A further increase of interpass temperature to 500 °C produced only minor reductions in the brittle α 2 phase fraction and the microhardness value. In view of these results, a suitable interpass temperature was found for producing crack-free components...|$|E
40|$|Weld filler alloys that exploit {{transformation}} plasticity through low austenite to {{martensite transformation}} temperatures offer an effective method of reducing residual stresses in strong steel <b>welds.</b> However, in <b>multipass</b> <b>welds,</b> the heat input from later weld passes may be insufficient to retransform prior welding passes, {{leading to the}} accumulation of thermally induced strains and elevated residual stresses. In this work, the residual stress distributions produced around arc welds fabricated with a martensitic weld filler alloy that transforms at a low temperature have been studied {{as a function of}} the number of passes deposited and the interpass temperature. It is found that when the interpass temperature is above the transformation temperature of the weld metal, the entire <b>multipass</b> <b>weld</b> transforms as a single entity, thus permitting the optimum exploitation of the transformation plasticity. In contrast, the deposition of new metal with a relatively low interpass temperature leads to increased residual stresses in the underlying layers, reducing or eliminating the beneficial stress states previously created...|$|R

The bulk properties of a <b>multipass</b> <b>weld</b> are therefore governed by both the initial microstructure of each weld pass and its subsequent thermal history.

Refurbishment of Superalloys gas turbine components {{is one of}} the methods use to reduce cost in operating and prolong gas turbine components life cycle, with welding as one of the major repair technique. Close tolerance requirements in gas turbine components fabrication and refurbishment practice demanded the improvement of welding procedure in order to minimize the problem of distortion. Uncontrolled distortion will lead to parts rejection and reduction in gas turbine efficiency. This work will present methods to obtain optimum welding parameters through simulation by SYSWELD and experimentation. The works presented here are divided into three case studies with final aim to improve repair procedure of Superalloys gas turbine components. Case Study 1 confirmed the suitabilit>- of SYSWELD code using Goldak model to simulate Superalloys material wielding for 3. 2 mm thickness material.

Piping branch junctions and nozzle attachments to main pressure vessels are common engineering components used in the power, oil and gas, and shipbuilding industries amongst others. These components are usually fabricated by <b>multipass</b> <b>welding.</b> The latter process is known to induce residual stresses at the fabrication stage, which can have severe adverse effects on the in-service behavior of such critical components. It is thus desirable if the distributions of residual stresses can be predicted well in advance of welding execution. This paper presents a comprehensive study of three dimensional residual stress distributions in a stainless steel tee branch junction during a <b>multipass</b> <b>welding</b> process. A full three dimensional thermomechanical finite element model has been developed for this purpose. A newly developed meshing technique has been used to model the complex intersection areas of the welded junction with all hexahedral elements.

Despite the exposition to thermal cycles on every pass, the heat affected zone presented a microstructure consisting of ferrite and austenite with a small proportion of sigma phase.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Multipass</b> <b>welds</b> made in 316 -L {{stainless}} steel are specific welds of primary circuit in nuclear power stations. Their complex structure complicates ultrasonic {{assessment of their}} structural integrity: they present a heterogeneous anisotropy that deteriorates the propagation of waves (deviation and division of the beam, attenuation…). Polycrystalline materials as {{stainless steel}} are composed of numerous discrete grains whose elastic properties are anisotropic and crystallographic axes are differently oriented. When an acoustic wave propagates through such a material, it is attenuated by scattering at grain boundaries. Provided the elastic constants of the different homogeneous domains of the weld, the finite-element model ATHENA (EDF & INRIA) predicts path and velocity of ultrasonic waves, but attenuation has still to {{be integrated into the}} code. Our work aims to provide realistic input data of attenuation compatible with the existing model in studying mechanisms leading to attenuation in anisotropic structures. The value of this attenuation depends on the size, shape, orientations distribution and anisotropy of the grains. When grains are equiaxed and randomly oriented, the average elastic properties are isotropic. But in the case of <b>multipass</b> <b>welds</b> made of austenitic stainless steel, crystalline growth mechanisms acting during the solidification lead to a macroscopic texture, with elongated and preferentially oriented grains. Thus their structure is anisotropic, and ultrasonic attenuation {{is a function of the}} propagation direction. First, experimental ultrasonic measurements obtained by means of classical techniques are presented and compared with theoretical predictions of the literature.
