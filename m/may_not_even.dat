He is credited with the composition of an epitaph for the tomb of his three predecessors at Hereford. The cathedral church of the see <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> have been located at Hereford by Cuthbert's time.|$|E

Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does not believe that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|Between 1926 and 1972, no Albertosaurus fossils {{were found}} at all; but, since the seventies, {{there has been a}} steady {{increase}} in the known material. Apart from the Dry Island bonebed, six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in Alberta and are housed in various Canadian museums: specimens RTMP 81.010.001, found in 1978 by amateur paleontologist Maurice Stefanuk; RTMP 85.098.001, found by Stefanuk on 16 June 1985; RTMP 86.64.001 (December 1985); RTMP 86.205.001 (1986); RTMP 97.058.0001 (1996); and CMN 11315. However, due to vandalism and accidents, no undamaged and complete skulls could be secured among these finds. Fossils have also been reported from the American states of Montana, New Mexico, and Wyoming, but these probably do not represent A. sarcophagus and <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> belong to the genus Albertosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless and <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may {{remain in the}} wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, {{which is similar to}} tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|The new Queen of Hungary {{subjected}} herself {{entirely to}} her controlling mother-in-law, Elizabeth of Poland. The {{fact that the}} young queen's retinue consisted of the same individuals who had served the queen mother indicates that Elizabeth of Bosnia <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> have had her own court. Her mother-in-law's influence prevailed until 1370, when Louis succeeded his maternal uncle, CasimirIII, as King of Poland. Elizabeth's maternal uncle, Vladislaus the White, had also been {{a candidate for the}} Polish throne. Following his coronation in Poland, Louis brought Casimir's underage daughters, Anne and Hedwig, to be raised by Elizabeth. Elizabeth, though Queen of Poland, was never crowned as such.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} neural tube {{transformation}} into structures {{that will eventually}} develop into {{the central nervous system}} is known as neurulation, the success of which is dependent on the presence of folate within the body. This process begins in the human approximately 21 days after conception, and is completed by 28 days. Thus, a woman <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> be aware of her pregnancy by the time the process of neurulation is complete, potentially causing severe consequences {{in the development of the}} fetus.|$|E
30|$|Our {{formulation}} for conductance-based models, with {{an adaptation}} current that is linear {{in a single}} gating variable, <b>may</b> <b>not</b> cover all possible cases, but it does include many typical ones, including two cases considered in [8] and [9], a voltage-dependent M-type K^+ current and an AHP current with a conductance that is linear in calcium. For adaptation currents with more complex voltage dependence, such as a slowly inactivating Na^+ current with fast gating variables, our theory <b>may</b> <b>not</b> apply <b>even</b> {{in the presence of}} a SNIC because the scaling argument used to derive Eq. (20) <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be valid <b>even</b> approximately.|$|R

25|$|In this form, {{the speech}} {{is usually the}} {{insertion}} of swear words within the sentence structure used to convey various ideas. At times, this use of formulaic language comes about due to the individual being greatly distressed or angry. However, there are situations where swear words are inserted unconsciously even if the individual is extremely happy. When the use of swear words is called {{to the attention of}} the individual, he or she <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> have been aware of the usage of such formulaic language.|$|E

Some of the countries that now outsource transcription work are the United States and Britain, with work outsourced to Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Australia, Pakistan and Barbados.|$|E
25|$|Occupied Armenia was reconstructed on Roman terms. In 164, a new capital, Kaine Polis ('New City'), {{replaced}} Artaxata. A {{new king}} was installed: a Roman senator of consular rank and Arsacid descent, C. Iulius Sohaemus. He <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> have been crowned in Armenia; the ceremony {{may have taken}} place in Antioch, or even Ephesus. Sohaemus was hailed on the imperial coinage of 164 under the legend : Lucius sat on a throne with his staff while Sohamenus stood before him, saluting the emperor.|$|E

25|$|Cultural Mormon is a {{term used}} for Mormons who no longer believe some, or many, of the doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), but who self-identify as Mormon. Usually, this {{is a result of}} having been raised in the LDS Church or having {{converted}} and spent a large portion of one's life as {{an active member of the}} LDS Church. Cultural Mormons may or may not be actively involved with the church, and in some cases <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> be official members of the church.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{theoretical}} {{upper limit}} {{to the size of}} districts in STV, and they <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> be needed at all: Thomas Hare's original proposal was for a single, nationwide district. In theory, STV could allow for the election of particularly small minorities provided they secure a quota's worth of votes, if very large districts were used. The 1925 Irish Senate election used one district to elect nineteen places and the Cork Corporation used a single 21-seat local electoral area until subdivided in time for the 1967 local election.|$|E
25|$|Other alleles {{result in}} even milder degrees of hyperandrogenism that <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> cause {{problems}} in males {{and may not}} be recognized until adolescence or later in females. Mild androgen effects in young women may include hirsutism, acne, or anovulation (which in turn can cause infertility). Testosterone levels in these women may be mildly elevated, or simply above average. These clinical features, of course, are those of polycystic ovary syndrome, and a small percentage of women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) are found to have late-onset CAH when investigated.|$|E
