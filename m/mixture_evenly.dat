40|$|Careful {{investigation}} {{has shown that}} when garbage is divided into different categories such as plastic, paper, metals, etc., food waste accounts for about 8 % of the refuse. This food waste is all decomposable and rather than send it away to dumps, can be put to valuable use as organic compost for yards and gardens. The idea below shows how the KITCHEN KOMPOSTER, which is made almost entirely of recycled materials, will produce a fine, clean, non-toxic compost. The entire process is natural and uses bacteria, millipedes, worms, wood lice and other invertebrates {{to break down the}} refuse thrown into the bin. How to use the KITCHEN KOMPOSTER: 1. Place the KOMPOSTER on a flat smooth surface such as concrete or a metal sheet. Be sure the bin is level. 2. Put large breadfruit leaves or other large leaves {{in the bottom of the}} bin to cover the holes. 3. Add millipedes, worms and wood lice from a sack of prestarted compost. Spread the <b>mixture</b> <b>evenly</b> on the leaves making sure the insects have an adequate depth of 'soil` to burrow into. 4. Add kitchen refuse into the bin whenever you need to dispose of scraps. Anything that is organic will decompose in the KOMPOSTER. 5. From time to time, add some garden refuse to the bin to help balance the moisture content in the bin. Be careful not to overheat the KOMPOSTER by adding a large amount of very fresh grass clippings. They will generate a high degree of heat if too much is added at the same time. 6. If you find any millipedes worms or wood lice while working in your garden or yard, add these to the KOMPOSTER, they will help speed up the composting process.

After mixing, the soil/sludge <b>mixture</b> was <b>evenly</b> distributed on the lysimeter surface. At 1 DAT, soil/sludge samples were taken at 5 different sampling points from the 0 to 5  cm top layer and analyzed for radioactivity content by combustion and subsequent radio-assaying. After that sampling, the lysimeter and surrounding area were sown with wheat (SW Kadrilj) according to GAP.|$|R
50|$|The {{consistency}} of the concrete used in the project was essential. It was difficult to create a concrete that could withstand both the thousands of tonnes bearing down on it and Persian Gulf temperatures that can reach 50 C. To combat this problem, the concrete was not poured during the day. Instead, during the summer months, ice {{was added to the}} mixture and it was poured at night when the air is cooler and the humidity is higher. A cooler concrete <b>mixture</b> cures <b>evenly</b> throughout and is therefore less likely to set too quickly and crack. Any significant cracks could have put the entire project in jeopardy.|$|R
50|$|Coalescing {{plate pack}} {{separators}} work very differently from centrifugal separators. With the plate packs, water is {{fed into the}} separator through gravity through the inlet pipe, then the <b>mixture</b> is spread <b>evenly</b> through the separation chamber where the coalescing plate packs are. In the plate packs the oil will rise because of their buoyancy and coalesce {{on the underside of}} the plates and form globules of oil that rise to the surface. From there the waste oil globules go into the clean water chamber and are discharged through the lower portion of the separator.|$|R

40|$|A chemometric {{model for}} the {{simultaneous}} estimation of phenobarbitone and phenytoin sodium anticonvulsant tablets using the back-propagation neural network calibration has been presented. The use of calibration datasets constructed from the spectral data of pure components is proposed. The calibration sets were designed such that the concentrations were orthogonal and span the possible <b>mixture</b> space fairly <b>evenly.</b> Spectra of phenobarbitone and phenytoin sodium were recorded at several concentrations within their linear range and used to compute the calibration mixture between wavelengths 220 and 260 nm at an interval of 1 nm. The back-propagation neural network model was optimized using three different sets of calibration and monitoring data {{for the number of}} hidden sigmoid neurons. The calibration model was thoroughly evaluated at several concentration levels using spectra obtained for 95 synthetic binary mixtures prepared using orthogonal designs. The optimized model showed sufficient robustness even when the calibration sets were constructed from different sets of pure spectra of components. Although the components showed complete spectral overlap, the model could accurately estimate the drugs, with satisfactory precision and accuracy, in tablet dosage with no interference from excipients, as indicated by the recovery study results...|$|R
40|$|Metabolomics {{has been}} {{a useful tool for}} {{biomarker}} discovery, disease mechanism investigation, food safety research, and so on. It aims to unbiased quantification and identification of metabolites existed in body fluids or tissues. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), with its powerful ability for metabolites separation and identification, has been widely used for metabolic investigation. Traditionally, the GC-MS based metabolic investigation can be divided into the non-targeted profiling of the whole metabolome with a full scan MS data acquisition mode and the targeted analysis of the interested metabolites with a selected ion monitoring (SIM) acquisition mode. The full scan based GC-MS profiling method ensures the acquisition of quantitative and qualitative information simultaneously. However, data acquired with this mode have significant low sensitivity than those of SIM mode due to the low scan speed of the quadrupole MS, the most widely used detector of GC/MS instrument. The other kind of GC/MS detector, time of flight (TOF) MS, known for its high scan speed, has narrower dynamic range than quadrupole MS. As the concentration distribution of metabolites in an organism ranges several orders of magnitude, the response of the low or the high concentration metabolites can hardly be acquired quantitatively with a full scan acquisition method. The SIM method with better sensitivity can expand the quantitation limit of the MS detector. Nevertheless, the SIM method based non-targeted profiling method has not been published yet owning to the unknown of SIM targets and their quantitation ions. In this study, a new strategy based on the combination of full scan and SIM acquisition mode was developed for the metabolic profiling analysis. Firstly, the quality control (QC) sample, the <b>mixture</b> of <b>evenly</b> blended equal amounts of the samples to be analyzed, was analyzed using a full scan mode and the metabolites were identified. Then, an algorithm was developed and used for the quantitation ions selection of the initially identified metabolites. In the end, the SIM method was established and the quantitation data of the rest samples were acquired. The retention time locking technique used in the present method ensured the retention time of the eluted components constant in the process of the batch samples analysis so that the SIM time group could be constructed. The method for quantitative ions selection was discussed and the developed method was then compared with the full scan based metabolic profiling method. The comparison result show that the developed method is a better solution for GC-MS based non-targeted profiling. 中国化学会色谱专业委员会Metabolomics {{has been a}} useful tool for biomarker discovery, disease mechanism investigation, food safety research, and so on.

40|$|During the {{construction}} of breakwaters contractors often encounter undesired reshaping of exposed core material. This reshaping {{is comparable to the}} deformation process of berm breakwaters in which the outer profile reshapes into a more stable s-curve. In the case of oblique waves this deformation is enhanced by a longshore transport of stones leading to even more loss of material and damage. Throughout the years few formulas were derived for both processes which describe the behaviour of berm breakwaters as well as gravel beaches reasonably well. These formulas however turned out to be inadequate when it comes to describing the behaviour of core material. In particular the influence of the wide grading of quarry run, commonly used as core material, is to a large extent unknown and generally not described in the available relations. To investigate this influence of the stone grading on both the two-dimensional deformation and longshore transport new physical model tests were carried out in the wave basin at Delft University of Technology. In total 12 tests were executed in which two different gradings, three different angles of wave attack and two different wave spectra were tested. Data collected from the tests included wave and profile measurements together with the displacements of stones, originating from two colour beams which were applied {{in the middle of the}} trunk. These data along with visual observations eventually led to a conceptual model describing stone movements in both transverse and longshore direction. Using Matlab three-dimensional profile and erosion models were generated from which the different profile parameters were determined. With respect to the distance from origin, for each test an exponential relation was derived to describe the stone displacements. After determination of the area of uniform transport these exponential relations were used to calculate the total longshore transport by means of extrapolation and multiple integrations. Subsequently all parameters found were compared to the formulas currently available for both processes. Regarding the deformation parameters the test results produced the best fit with the formulas derived in [MERLI 2009]. Still on several occasions a deviant relation was found concerning the influence of wave obliquity. In addition, the formulas became less accurate for the narrow grading used in the tests, which fell outside the range tested by Merli. However, for the crest height of the deformed profile test results deviated completely from the available formula as no influence was found whatsoever for all tested parameters. Here the deviation was contributed to a higher instability of the part above the initial deformation, partly due to the steepness of the slope. On the subject of the longshore transport clear trends were found describing the influence of the varying parameters. Both a higher wave load and wider grading lead to an increase of the longshore transport. For the wider grading, however, this increase gave a rather distorted image, as not all fractions in the <b>mixture</b> were transported <b>evenly.</b> Due to segregation the coarsest fractions were mostly transported in the transverse direction while the finer fractions were transported further away in the longitudinal direction. Alternatively, computation of the longshore volume transport proved to be more representative. Regarding the effect of wave obliquity an increase in angle of wave attack of 30 to 45 degrees was accompanied by a decrease in longshore transport; though this decrease was less than already available formulas indicated. However despite the fact that it describes a completely different trend concerning this particular influence, the best fit was found after multiplying the relation derived by [ALIKHANI 1996] with a factor 100.
