Saint Ronan's, {{since this}} veracious history {{was given to}} the public, has revived as a sort of alias, or second title, to the very {{pleasant}} village of Inverleithen upon Tweed, where there is a <b>medicinal</b> <b>spring</b> much frequented by visitors. Prizes for some of the manly and athletic sports, common in the pastoral districts around, are competed for under the title of the Saint Ronan's Games.

60|$|But {{there was}} that on Tyrrel's mind which defied the enlivening power of good cheer and of wine, which only maketh man's heart glad when that heart has no secret oppression to {{counteract}} its influence. Tyrrel found himself on a spot which he had loved in that delightful season, when youth and high spirits awaken all those flattering promises which are so ill kept to manhood. He drew his chair into the embrasure of the old-fashioned window, and throwing up the sash to enjoy the fresh air, suffered his thoughts to return to former days, while his eyes wandered over objects which they had not looked upon for several eventful years. He could behold beneath his eye, {{the lower part of}} the decayed village, as its ruins peeped from the umbrageous shelter with which they were shrouded. Still lower down, upon the little holm which formed its church-yard, was seen the Kirk of Saint Ronan's; and looking yet farther, towards the junction of Saint Ronan's burn with the river which traversed the larger dale or valley, he could see whitened, by the western sun, the rising houses, which were either newly finished, or in the act of being built, about the <b>medicinal</b> <b>spring.</b>|$|E

50|$|The name Cuddington is Anglo Saxon and {{derives from}} the 'Tun of Cuda' which {{translates}} to the 'People of Cuda'. Cuddington was designated as a township in the 7th century when the then Archbishop of Canterbury (Theodore) introduced the parochial system within the Parish of Weaverham.

5000|$|Recently {{a number}} of glass Hamilton style bottle - often known as ‘torpedo’ bottles - which all bare the {{inscription}} [...] "bottled at the Royal Pump Room, Harrogate", were donated to the museum. Very few of these unusually shaped Victorian bottles have survived. They now form part of the display of the Pump Room's bottling room. This display serves {{as a reminder that}} there was a wider social and economic significance of the Pump Room. Strong Sulphur Water was once bottled and exported as <b>medicinal</b> <b>spring</b> water for consumption throughout the country.|$|E
5000|$|In 1812, {{known in}} Alta California history as [...] "the year of earthquakes" [...] (el ano de los temblores), {{frequent}} earthquakes were {{felt in the}} rancheria area. The hot springs of the valley increased in temperature, and a new hot mud spring (cienegata) appeared near Politana, {{that came to be}} called Urbita Springs. The mud spring was used by Spanish missionaries for religious ceremonies, and became regarded as a <b>medicinal</b> <b>spring</b> by them. These practices aroused fears in the Serrano peoples, about the superstitious activities. Hoping to allay their fears the missionaries buried the mud spring with earth. However this did not work.|$|E
5000|$|The village name is Old English (Anglo-Saxon) in origin, {{and means}} [...] "Cudda's estate." [...] In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was {{recorded}} as Cudintuna.

Hence the country is rich in brooks and hot springs as well as <b>medicinal</b> <b>springs</b> and spas; as of 2003, there are 1250 springs that provide water warmer than 30 degrees C. 90% of Hungary's drinking water is mostly retrieved from such sources.|$|R
50|$|In 1772, {{the springs}} {{were part of}} the newly formed Berkeley County, named after its colonial governor, Norborne Berkeley. The waters became known as Berkeley Springs because the {{existing}} protocol was to name springs after the colonial Virginia county in which they were located. Previously, the area had been called Warm <b>Springs</b> and <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Springs</b> among other names.|$|R
50|$|It {{is located}} on Capon Springs Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 16) along Capon Springs Run. Originally known as Frye's Springs after its {{discoverer}} Henry Frye, and later established as the Town of Watson in 1787, the town was renamed for its <b>medicinal</b> <b>spring.</b> The springs were believed to carry such healing power that half an acre sold for $900 in gold in the late 18th century. After West Virginia seceded from Virginia in 1863, it had to pay Virginia {{for the loss of}} the springs during Reconstruction. The historic Capon Springs & Farms resort is located here and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
50|$|Coldbath Fields Prison (also {{known as}} the Middlesex House of Correction) was {{originally}} a prison run by local magistrates and where most prisoners served short sentences. Coldbath Fields {{also served as a}} debtor's prison. It took its name from Cold Bath Spring, a <b>medicinal</b> <b>spring</b> discovered in 1697. The prison housed men, women and children until 1850, when the women and children moved to Tothill Fields Bridewell in Victoria and Coldbath was restricted to adult male offenders over the age of 17. Despite its aspirations to be a more humanitarian prison (it was designed by John Howard), it became notorious for its strict regime of silence and its use of the treadmill.|$|E
50|$|The first {{building}} {{on the site of}} Aubrey House was attached to a <b>medicinal</b> <b>spring</b> called Kensington Wells. This was built in 1698 by John Wright, a 'Doctor in Physick', and by 1705 had become 'much esteem'd and resorted to for its Medicinal Virtues'. From 1744 Sir Edward Lloyd owned the lease on the house and purchased the freehold in 1750. Lloyd was largely responsible for transforming the house into its current form. John Rocque's map of London indicates that the wings were added to the house between 1745 and 1754, with the north front appearing to date from the same period. By 1767 Aubrey House was occupied by the politician and art collector Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor.|$|E

5000|$|According to P. H. Reaney's Place-Names of Essex, the {{standard}} guide to etymology in the county, the name means 'Cicca's well', Cicca being an Anglo-Saxon personal name. In medieval sources the name appears {{with a wide}} variety of spellings including [...] "Cinghe uuella" [...] and Chikewelle". Folk etymology has sought to derive the name from a lost [...] "king's well", supposed to have been to the south-east of the parish near the border of what is now the London Borough of Redbridge. There were several <b>medicinal</b> <b>springs</b> in Chigwell Row documented by Miller Christy in his book History of the mineral waters and <b>medicinal</b> <b>springs</b> of the county of Essex, published in 1910. The proposal by 18th-century local historian Nathaniel Salmon that the [...] "-well" [...] element in the name derives from Anglo-Saxon weald (forest), indicating Chigwell's location in a royal demesne rather than Anglo-Saxon wielle (well) has long been superseded by modern onomastic study and is no longer credible.|$|R
50|$|The 1885 Kelly's Directory {{notes that}} Holywell with Aunby {{consists}} of 2300 acre with chief agricultural of barley and wheat, and an 1881 population of 63, and that “a <b>medicinal</b> <b>spring</b> rises here {{from where the}} place takes its name”. Holywell Hall, a mansion in “well-wooded park”, was then the seat of Charles Thomas Samuel Birch-Reynardson DL, lord of the manor, and sole landowner. The chapel in the park, a small stone building in Early English style, was reconstructed in reign of Queen Anne. It comprises a chancel, nave, south aisle and two-bell tower. A restoration of 1863-64 included the replacement of a previous flat roof with one of open timber, with the church interior re-fitted in oak, “effected under the superintendence of rector Rev J B Reynardson”.|$|E
50|$|Hockley is an Anglo Saxon {{word meaning}} {{a small hill}} and today {{there is still a}} large wooded area named Hockley Woods. Notable {{buildings}} in the village include the church of St Peter and Paul, which has a nave which was possibly built before the twelfth century, a thirteenth-century chancel and a fourteenth-century tower, the upper half of which is octagonal and was built at a later date. The tower holds three bells, manufactured by Miles Gray in 1626, by James Bartlett in 1684 and by John Hodgson in 1657, and the building is Grade II* listed. The church is situated to the north-west of the village centre, where a grade II listed Victorian pump room is situated. The building was built as a spa to a design by John Lockyer in 1842, after Robert Clay found a <b>medicinal</b> <b>spring</b> in 1838. It was subsequently used as a Baptist chapel, and now houses a factory. Hockley is also the site of the former Bullwood Hall prison which closed in 2013.|$|E
5000|$|For 16 years Baruch practiced {{medicine}} in South Carolina. He also advocated for the smallpox vaccination {{for the children}} of the state, and he helped to reactivate the South Carolina State Medical Association, serving as president. He held a position on the faculty of the South Carolina State Medical College, and he was chairman of the Board of Health, later renamed South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. [...] However, Baruch grew increasingly dissatisfied with the indiscriminate use of unproven medical remedies. He studied the healing philosophies of Austrian physician Vincent Priessnitz (1799-1852), and in particular, the success of a therapeutic spa in the Silesian Foothills. The remedies were largely predicated upon frequent bathing and irrigation of the gastrointestinal tract; an alternative form of medicine called hydrotherapy. Patients recuperated in a restful, calm environment, ate a prudent diet, eliminated alcohol and tobacco, and engaged in physical activity. Later, Baruch also credited Wilhelm Winternitz for his pioneering work in hydrotherapy. Baruch would go on to introduce <b>medicinal</b> <b>spring</b> therapies, known as balneology, and hydrotherapy to the United States of America.|$|E

50|$|In the 1850s, Robert W. Greenwell {{purchased}} land in {{the area}} of what is now known as Greenwell Springs and began developing the area into a rural resort that was built around 10 <b>medicinal</b> <b>springs.</b> Despite the springs being in close proximity to each other, each spring was said to have very different and distinct mineral properties from the others. It was believed that this indicated the springs each came from different levels beneath the ground.|$|R
