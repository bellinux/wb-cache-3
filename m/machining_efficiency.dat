Much {{work has been done}} on maximising <b>machining</b> <b>efficiency.</b> However, it is perhaps fair to say that much more remains to be done. This paper focuses on a method that maximises <b>machining</b> <b>efficiency</b> through the use of optimised machining parameters in single-tool milling operations.

INTRODUCTION Efficiency has always been an important issue in machining. Manufacturing engineers believe that use of improved or optimum machining parameters plays an important role in <b>machining</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Maximum <b>machining</b> <b>efficiency</b> leads to reduced machining cost and time. Taylor [1] was the first who realised that there must be an optimum combination of cutting speed and feed rate which result in efficient machining. Many res [...] ...|$|E

Careful {{attention}} {{is given to}} the most common, turbomachinery performance problems which result from an inadequate understanding of component and <b>machine</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Examples of several classical problems are presented and the basic definitions and principles involved are carefully reviewed.

Although <b>machine</b> <b>efficiency</b> frequently plays a secondary role compared with questions of durability, it is pointed out that even small errors in rated efficiency can cause significant stability problems, power/speed mismatch, and even contribute to noise and vibration problems.

40|$|AbstractUsing the {{characteristic}} that most metal can burn in oxygen, {{put forward a}} new high-efficiency process that deals with the difficult-to-cut materials multi-function electrode EDM-induced ablation machining technology. Design the multi-function electrode and inject high-pressure oxygen and dielectric fluid rush to the machining area through it, then the gas and liquid are mixed as processing medium. During the machining process, first, surface material is removed by the electric spark discharge, which induces the combustion reaction between the metal and oxygen, generates very large amounts of combustion heat. Second, the combustion heat melts the difficult-to-cut metal and then turns the combustion reaction into a high-efficiency ablation reaction which {{is controlled by the}} density of the oxygen bubble dispersed by high-pressure water. The water-oxygen mixed medium is helpful for the interpolar deionization between the electrodes and the elimination of reaction products. Experiment has been conducted on machining titanium by combining this new technology with traditional electrical discharge turning (EDT). The result shows that the <b>machining</b> <b>efficiency</b> of this method can reach to 313 mm 3 /min which is 4. 3 times of the normal EDT <b>machining</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The experiment also shows that the <b>machining</b> <b>efficiency</b> heavily relies on the polarity effect during ablation process, the positive polarity <b>machining</b> <b>efficiency</b> is far higher than the negative polarity processing, and that the gas and liquid pressure difference should be controlled under a certain range.

There exist a large number of outdated cutting machine tools especially in developing and emerging countries which are still taking a considerable share in global value creation.

The on-line interpolation stage generates interpolated drive commands with the trapezoidal acceleration profile, where chord errors and centripetal accelerations at transition corners are also constrained.

40|$|The iso-planar (Cartesian) {{tool path}} {{generation}} method {{has been used}} for several decades. However, it suffers an inherent drawback: in the region where the direction of the surface normal is close to that of the parallel intersecting planes, the intersecting plane intervals have to be reduced because of the influence of surface slopes. This causes redundant tool paths in the associated flatter regions and results in lower <b>machining</b> <b>efficiency.</b> This paper presents an algorithm that overcomes the disadvantage of the iso-planar method while keeping its advantages of robustness and simplicity. In this algorithm, the concept of isophote is applied to partition the surface into different regions. In each region the tool path side steps are adaptive to the surface features. Therefore redundant tool paths are avoided. By applying the region-by-region or global-local machining strategy, the <b>machining</b> <b>efficiency</b> is increased...|$|E
