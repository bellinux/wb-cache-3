Although his arguments presage both neoclassical economics and institutionalism, he is not readily classified into either. [...] As a Professor of Political Economy, his first major scholarly contribution was on his The Wages Question which set out to debunk the wage-fund doctrine as well as address the then-radical notion of obligations between the employer and the employed. His theory of wage distribution later {{came to be known}} as residual theory and set the stage for contributions by John Bates Clark on the <b>marginal</b> <b>productivity</b> theory. Despite Walker's advocacy of profit sharing and expansion of educational opportunities using trade and industrial schools, he was an avowed opponent of the nascent socialist movement and published critiques of Edward Bellamy's popular novel Looking Backward.|$|E
2500|$|Dollar/Collier {{showed that}} current {{allocations}} of aid are allocated inefficiently. They {{came to the}} conclusion that aid money is given in many cases as an incentive to change policy, and for political reasons, which in many cases can be less efficient than the optimal condition. They agree that bad policy is detrimental to economic growth, which is a key component of poverty reduction, but have found that aid dollars do not significantly incentivize governments to change policy. In fact, they have negligible impact. As an alternative, Dollar proposes that aid be funneled more towards countries with [...] "good" [...] policy and less than optimal amounts of aid for their massive amounts of poverty. With respect to [...] "optimal amounts" [...] Dollar calculated the <b>marginal</b> <b>productivity</b> of each additional dollar of foreign aid for the countries sampled, and saw that some countries had very high rates of <b>marginal</b> <b>productivity</b> (each dollar went further), while others [...] had low [...] levels of <b>marginal</b> <b>productivity.</b> In terms of economic efficiency, aid funding would be best allocated towards countries whose marginal productivities per dollar were highest, and away from those countries who had low to negative marginal productivities. [...] The conclusion was that while an estimated 10 million people are lifted from poverty with current aid policies, that number could be increased to 19 million with efficient aid allocation.|$|E

Starting from the standard dynamic neoclassical model, augmented with the public capital stock, the optimal condition for the provision of public capital would be that, in the steady state, the <b>marginal</b> <b>productivities</b> of both public and private capital should be equal. In the empirical application we will estimate a growth equation derived from a simple Cobb-Douglas production function, where the coefficients on the rates of investment in private and public capital would be their respective <b>marginal</b> <b>productivities.</b> The econometric estimation of such an equation with data for the Spanish regions would provide us estimates of the <b>marginal</b> <b>productivities</b> of both factors, which would allow us to infer whether public capital stock in the Spanish regions would be insufficient or otherwise excessive. ...|$|R
30|$|First, {{migration}} {{is associated with}} a risk of expropriation since it entails a decrease in household size, which may induce the redistribution of some of the household land in order to maintain egalitarian land holdings (Rozelle and Li 1998). The RLCL imposes a ban on large-scale reallocations of land and limited small-scale readjustments. It reduced farmers’ worry about their risk of losing land rights at a future time if they decided to migrate to off-farm activities. Second, {{migration is}} encouraged by the development of land exchange rights. The RLCL detailed the right to lease, assign, exchange, and carry out other transactions with land contracts. Thus, this policy change was expected to facilitate market transfers and improve the marketability of land rights. Land transfers permit households with higher <b>marginal</b> <b>productivities</b> of land to acquire land from households with lower <b>marginal</b> <b>productivities,</b> and induce a better allocation of household labor endowments in response to outside employment opportunities, such as those in off-farm activities.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{contribution}} to the growing literature on constrained inefficiencies in economies with financial frictions. The purpose is to present two simple examples, inspired by the stochastic models in Gersbach-Rochet (2012) and Lorenzoni (2008), of deterministic environments in which such inefficiencies arise through credit constraints. Common to both examples is a pecuniary externality, which operates through an asset price. In the second example, a simple transfer between two groups of agents can bring about a Pareto improvement. In a first best economy, there are no pecuniary externalities because <b>marginal</b> <b>productivities</b> are equalised. But when agents face credit constraints, there is a wedge between their <b>marginal</b> <b>productivities</b> and those of the non-credit-constrained agents. The wedge {{is the source of the}} pecuniary externality: economies with these kinds of imperfections in credit markets are not second-best efficient. This is akin to the constrained inefficiency of an economy with incomplete markets, as in Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1986) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} Feder’s {{production function}} in revisiting {{the relationship between}} exports and economic growth by testing the hypothesis of the export-led growth {{in relation to the}} Arab Republic of Egypt. It also aims to show the difference in the <b>marginal</b> <b>productivities</b> between the export and non-export sectors in Egypt and how the export sector can positively affect the non-export sectors. The model mainly adopts a supply-side description of the economy, using the neo-classical growth approach under the framework of an aggregate production function. The conclusion of the study is that <b>marginal</b> <b>productivities</b> are higher in the export sector than in the non-export sector. This will allow the Egyptian economy to grow faster without having new capital infusion or labor expansion simply by reallocating the limited resources into the export sector. The reallocation of resources to the export sector will produce positive externalities and result in higher productivity for the whole Egyptian economy. ...|$|R

30|$|In {{this paper}} I bring to {{fruition}} the neoclassical measurement of performance change in an input-output framework. Some pitfalls are avoided. First, market prices {{need not be}} perfectly competitive and, more generally, the observed allocation of resources may be inefficient. Solow’s ascription of TFP-growth to technical change holds in an idyllic neoclassical world where resources are rewarded according to their <b>marginal</b> <b>productivities,</b> but not beyond. Market power, managerial slacks and other sources of inefficiency abound and we must factor in their variations to properly account for performance changes. Since these conditions differ between industries, an input-output framework seems promising.|$|R
