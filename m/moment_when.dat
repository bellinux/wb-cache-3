5|$|To {{a public}} well-versed in the {{particulars}} of the disaster, the scene would have been understood to encompass {{the aftermath of the}} crew's abandonment, focusing on the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> all hope seemed lost—the Argus reappeared two hours later and rescued those who remained.|$|E
60|$|Then {{came the}} pleasantest {{time of the}} day, after a long chase or jaunt--the silent moments, {{watching}} the glowing embers of the fire; the speaking <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> a red-blooded story rang clear and true; the twilight <b>moments,</b> <b>when</b> the wood-smoke smelled sweet.|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we look at}} {{four cases}} of key {{historical}} policies in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Tanzania to examine how states engage with citizen voices. The policies all took place in contexts of political change and major junctures of democratisation. We identify three kinds of <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> the state listens: hearing <b>moments,</b> <b>when</b> it engages with citizen voices but {{does not change the}} way it acts; consultation <b>moments,</b> <b>when</b> it engages with citizen voices through two-way dialogue, resulting in one-sided action; and concertation <b>moments,</b> <b>when</b> coalitions between reform-minded officials and politicians and organised citizen voices engage in two-way dialogue and action for accountable governance. Concertation <b>moments</b> occurred <b>when</b> there was a shared sense of urgency and a common goal across state and non-state actors, and despite different understandings of accountable governance. But concertation moments are also laborious and temporary, part of larger, ever-changing policy processes, and often states revert to consultation or hearing...|$|R

Intuition of danger had evidently smitten Hemmings, for he made no allusion to {{the object of his}} visit.

5|$|Lucullus had {{initially}} {{decided to make}} a running charge with his infantry, a Roman military tactic that minimized the amount of time an enemy could utilize its archers and sling infantry prior to close combat engagement. However, he decided against this at the last <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> he realized that the Armenian cataphracts posed the greatest threat to his men, ordering instead a diversionary attack with his Gallic and Thracian cavalry against the cataphracts.|$|E
5|$|Screaming mouths {{appears in}} many of Bacon's works from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. The motif was {{developed}} from sources including medical textbooks, and images of the nurse in the Odessa Steps sequence in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin. Bacon kept a close-up still of the screaming nurse, at the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> she has {{been shot in the}} eye. He referred to the still in paintings throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|Tensions mounted and, on May 14, 1864, Cuza {{carried out}} a coup d'état, coinciding with the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> Conservatives imposed a censure vote. Kogălniceanu read in Parliament the monarch's {{decision}} to dissolve it, after which Cuza introduced a new constitution, titled Statutul dezvoltător al Convenției de la Paris ("Statute Expanding the Paris Convention"). Together with a law virtually establishing a system of universal male suffrage, it was submitted to the 1864 plebiscite, gaining support from 682,621 voters out of 754,148.|$|E

5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 09:30 Eastern Daylight Time (UTC-4) for a 30-minute warm-up session. It took place in cloudy and windy weather conditions. Both Ferrari drivers {{maintained}} their good pace from qualifying; Michael Schumacher had the fastest time, a 1:18.932. Barrichello finished with the second quickest time. The McLaren drivers rounded out the top four fastest drivers; Häkkinen in front of Coulthard. Amongst the slower runners, Heidfeld had a worrying <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> his engine cover was shed from the chassis on the main straight.|$|E
5|$|The {{first people}} {{to write about the}} May Revolution were {{participants}} who wrote memoirs, biographies and diaries. However, their works were motivated by purposes other than historiographic ones, such as to explain the reasons for their actions, clean their public images, or express their support or rejection of the public figures and ideas of the time. For example, Manuel Moreno wrote the biography of his brother Mariano as propaganda for the revolutions in Europe, and Cornelio Saavedra wrote his autobiography at a <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> his image was highly questioned, to justify himself to his sons.|$|E
5|$|This {{problem is}} not {{exclusive}} to electric vehicles. In 2007 research at the Technical University Munich showed that ordinary vehicles in background noise are often detected too late for safe accident avoidance. The researchers measured the distances of 35 approaching vehicles to a pedestrian in the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> they just got audible in a stationary background noise. These distances were then compared to the stopping distances of the respective cars and an algorithm was proposed to estimate them based on auditory masking.|$|E

5|$|As dusk {{began to}} fall on the drying track, the No. 8 Peugeot {{suffered}} from rear wheel hub failures which required two lengthy visits to the garage. This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place. Jacques Villeneuve's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time, which dropped it to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi. The No. 1 Audi had its own brief <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> the No. 63 Corvette clipped the Audi's rear end. The Corvette was forced to take evasive action through the Dunlop Chicane's gravel trap, and the Audi required replacement rear bodywork on its next pit stop.|$|E
5|$|As prosperous as {{the region}} was, {{it was not}} unharmed by the {{constant}} Ottoman–Habsburg wars and was often the target of Turkish, Tatar and Hungarian rebel raids. By the 1630s, {{the idea of an}} organized anti-Ottoman revolt had reached the town of Chiprovtsi. In his 1650 account to the senate of the Republic of Venice Petar Parchevich described the long preparations for an armed struggle and the support-seeking visits of his fellow townsmen to the kings of Poland and Austria. Since then, the inhabitants of Chiprovtsi waited for the suitable <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> {{they would be able to}} instigate an effective uprising and continued to co-operate with the leaders of the European realms.|$|E
5|$|He was {{the referee}} {{for the game}} between the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers, played December 17, 2006, that {{included}} Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre becoming the all-time leader for pass completions among quarterbacks in the NFL. Favre was unaware that his 4,968 pass completions were a record until he was informed during the game by Hochuli. Hochuli was the referee again for another Favre record-breaking <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> Favre threw his 421st touchdown pass of his career on September 30, 2007 at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota to break the record previously held by Dan Marino.

5|$|In January 2002 Eduardo Duhalde was {{appointed}} president, becoming Argentina's fifth president in two weeks. Roberto Lavagna, who became Minister of the Economy in April 2002, was credited for the ensuing {{recovery of the}} economy, having stabilised prices and the exchange rate in a <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> Argentina was at risk of hyperinflation. Since the default in 2001, growth has resumed, with the Argentine economy growing by over 6% a year for seven of the eight years to 2011. This was achieved {{in part because of}} a commodity price boom, and also because the government managed to keep the value of the currency low, boosting industrial exports.|$|E
5|$|The Ideas {{from the}} Deep team {{could not afford}} to leave their jobs to work on the game full-time, so they {{continued}} to work at Softdisk, spending their time on the Gamer's Edge games during the day and on Commander Keen at night and weekends using Softdisk computers. The group split into different roles: Hall became the game designer and creative director, John Carmack and Romero were the programmers, and Wilbur the manager. They invited artist Adrian Carmack from Softdisk to join them late in development, while Roathe was soon removed from the group. Ideas from the Deep spent nearly every waking <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> they were not working at Softdisk from October through December 1990 working on Commander Keen, with Wilbur forcing them to eat and take breaks.|$|E

5|$|The {{stories were}} written when Irish {{nationalism}} {{was at its}} peak and {{a search for a}} national identity and purpose was raging; at a crossroads of history and culture, Ireland was jolted by converging ideas and influences. The stories centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in Dubliners later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel Ulysses. The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists. Subsequent stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence and maturity.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{remained}} dry for the Saturday-morning practice sessions. Häkkinen set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the third}} session at 1:51.043, quicker than his best on Friday and ahead of Frentzen, Trulli and Ralf Schumacher. Coulthard, who had an engine problem early in the session, was fifth-fastest (ahead of Button and Michael Schumacher). Alesi, Villeneuve and Sauber driver Nick Heidfeld rounded out the top ten. During the final practice session Häkkinen could not improve his time, although he remained the fastest. Button, much happier with his car's handling, set the second-fastest time. The Jordan drivers were third and fourth, with Trulli ahead of Frentzen. Ralf Schumacher and Coulthard completed the top six. Of the slower drivers, Marc Gené had an anxious <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> his Minardi car shed its engine cover but was {{able to return to}} his garage.|$|E
5|$|Barbarian King Alrik– The former {{ruler of}} {{a horde of}} barbarians. As the {{champion}} of Hades, he sought the Ambrosia to save his ailing father. Alrik was ultimately unsuccessful and was killed by Kratos. Resurrected by Hades, Prince Alrik learned that he had become King {{after the death of}} his father. Alrik sought vengeance against Kratos, and his barbarian horde threatened to overwhelm Kratos' opposing Spartan army. Alrik almost killed Kratos in combat, but this was undone at the critical <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> Kratos offered up his life to Ares and was returned to battle equipped with the Blades of Chaos, which Kratos used to decapitate Alrik. Alrik eventually fought his way out of the Underworld, and intent on revenge, found and confronted Kratos on the Island of Creation. Kratos killed the Barbarian King once again, and took his hammer. The character was voiced by Bob Joles in God of War II, and Fred Tatasciore in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E
