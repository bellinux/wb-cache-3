A new method and instrument called the moisture management tester (MMT) is developed to evaluate textile <b>moisture</b> management <b>properties.</b> This new method {{can be used}} to quantitatively measure liquid moisture transfer in one step in a fabric in multidirections, where liquid moisture spreads on both surfaces of the fabric and transfers from one surface to the opposite. Ten indexes are introduced to characterize the liquid <b>moisture</b> management <b>properties</b> of fabrics. Eight sets of sportswear are tested with the MMT and the results show that liquid <b>moisture</b> management <b>properties</b> are significantly different for these fabrics.

50|$|It {{is hard to}} say {{something}} general about the soil thermal properties at a certain location because these are {{in a constant state of}} flux from diurnal and seasonal variations. Apart from the basic soil composition, which is constant at one location, soil thermal properties are strongly influenced by the soil volumetric water content, volume fraction of solids and volume fraction of air. Air is a poor thermal conductor and reduces the effectiveness of the solid and liquid phases to conduct heat. While the solid phase has the highest conductivity it is the variability of soil moisture that largely determines thermal conductivity. As such soil <b>moisture</b> <b>properties</b> and soil thermal propertiess are very closely linked and are often measured and reported together. Temperature variations are most extreme at the surface of the soil and these variations are transferred to sub surface layers but at reduced rates as depth increases. Additionally there is a time delay as to when maximum and minimum temperatures are achieved at increasing soil depth (sometimes referred to as thermal lag).|$|E
50|$|Weather fronts are {{boundaries}} between two masses of air of different densities, or different temperature and <b>moisture</b> <b>properties,</b> which normally are convergence zones {{in the wind}} field and are the principal cause of significant weather.

Wind shear in the horizontal occurs near these boundaries.Cold fronts feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may be preceded by squall lines and dry lines. Cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind shear than warm fronts. When a front becomes stationary, it can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind speed, known as a shear line, though the wind direction across the front normally remains constant. In the tropics, tropical waves move {{from east to west}} across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins. Directional and speed shear can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves, as northerly winds precede the wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis. Horizontal wind shear can also occur along local land breeze and sea breeze boundaries.|$|E

The winter time brings harsh and varied weather. The midsummer months bring in warm moist and dry air, depending on the area within the region and what air masses affect those areas. Paralleling the varying climate patterns is the precipitation. The areas nearest the Gulf of Mexico, where the atmospheric moisture is greatest, will receive more than forty inches of precipitation annually. The wastern areas of the region, such as Montana, receive less than fourteen inches annually. In the winter time, the southern region has less than an inch of snowfall, while the northern regions receive more than forty. The spring time is also a season that brings much precipitation to the Great Plains through the cold, dry air masses that interact with the air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, creating outbreaks of severe thunderstorms with heavy rainfall, high winds, hail, and tornadoes. Most of the winter season in the Northern Plains actually has a snow blanket over {{a majority of the}} winter season. This shows how there is consistent precipitation over the region during the winter months, while in the heat of summer there is more chance for drought with sporadic heavy rains.|$|E

The {{objective}} of the studies was to compare optimum moisture content determined with Proctor's method with other <b>moisture</b> <b>properties</b> of the selected soils from the region of Szczecin Lowland (Poland). Soils of the 1 st and 2 nd complex of agricultural usefulness were investigated by measurements conducted on soil samples collected outside of headlands and technological routes. In the subsoil the following soil properties were determined: current field moisture content, soil moisture at water potentials pF 0 and pF 2, granulometric composition, density of solid phase, humus content, reaction, limits of plasticity and liquidity, maximum dry density of solid particles and optimal mois-ture content determined with Proctor's apparatus. It was proved that variability of optimal moisture value increases along {{with the increase of}} loamy fractions.
