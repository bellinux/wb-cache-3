5|$|As {{provisional}} {{president in}} 1861, Davis formed his first cabinet. Robert Toombs of Georgia {{was the first}} Secretary of State and Christopher Memminger of South Carolina became Secretary of the Treasury. LeRoy Pope Walker of Alabama was made Secretary of War, after being recommended for this post by Clement Clay and William Yancey (both of whom declined to accept cabinet positions themselves). John Reagan of Texas became Postmaster General. Judah P. Benjamin of Louisiana became Attorney General. Although Stephen Mallory was not put forward by the delegation from his state of Florida, Davis insisted {{that he was the}} best <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of Secretary of the Navy, and he was eventually confirmed.|$|E
5|$|That same year, {{he joined}} the Schutzstaffel (SS) as an SS-Führer (SS-Leader); his SS number was 168. The SS, {{initially}} part of the much larger SA, was formed in 1923 for Hitler's personal protection, and was re-formed in 1925 as an elite unit of the SA. Himmler's first leadership position in the SS was that of SS-Gauführer (district leader) in Lower Bavaria from 1926. Strasser appointed Himmler deputy propaganda chief in January 1927. As was typical in the NSDAP, he had considerable freedom of action in his post, which increased over time. He began to collect statistics {{on the number of}} Jews, Freemasons, and enemies of the party, and following his strong need for control, he developed an elaborate bureaucracy. In September 1927, Himmler told Hitler of his vision to transform the SS into a loyal, powerful, racially pure elite unit. Convinced that Himmler was the <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> Hitler appointed him Deputy Reichsführer-SS, with the rank of SS-Oberführer.|$|E
25|$|For the 2009–10 season, Feyenoord {{appointed}} {{former assistant}} manager and Feyenoord footballer Mario Been {{to take over}} from Leon Vlemmings. Been, after achieving minor European successes with NEC Nijmegen, was considered the ideal <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> Former manager Leo Beenhakker, at that time manager of the Polish national squad, took over the role as Technical Director. Partly because of this position, {{he was able to}} attract more investors to the club leading to some unexpected signings, such as Sekou Cissé, Dani Fernández and Stefan Babović.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{preparations}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{project had}} begun many months beforehand, from careful stage-planning to the choreography and music arrangements <b>for</b> <b>the</b> orchestra. Siddharta chose {{to work with}} those who had proven to be <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> <b>The</b> choreography was entrusted to Miha Krušič (choreography <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Go Easy video) and the music arrangements to Milko Lazar and Slavko Avsenik Jr (<b>the</b> arrangements <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2002 Križanke concert).What sprouted was a sight for sore eyes: three stages, breathtaking choreographies and costumes, eye-watering orchestrations, Siddharta at their best, and a blanket of over 60,000 hands.|$|R
5000|$|This {{imposition}} {{was maintained}} until the Norman conquest of England. At the time, several criminals, {{rather than being}} put to death, would be ordered to provide {{a certain number of}} wolf tongues annually. The monk Galfrid, whilst writing about the miracles of St. Cuthbert seven centuries earlier, observed that wolves were so numerous in Northumbria, that it was virtually impossible <b>for</b> even <b>the</b> richest flock-masters to protect their sheep, despite employing many <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> <b>The</b> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states that the month of January was known as “Wolf manoth”, as this was the first full month of wolf hunting by the nobility. Officially, this hunting season would end on March 25; thus it encompassed the cubbing season, when wolves were at their most vulnerable, and their fur was of greater quality.|$|R
50|$|In 1664, {{a second}} attempt was made, {{but this one}} also ended badly as <b>the</b> <b>men</b> chosen <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> {{abandoned}} their sick commander, van Niewland, without proper treatment, and he eventually died.|$|R
25|$|Wilson had hoped, {{as early}} as March 1905, to succeed Rawlinson as Commandant at Staff College, Camberley, when Rawlinson {{told him he had}} been offered a brigadier-general’s staff {{position}} at Aldershot Command; however the move was postponed {{until the end of the}} year. In June 1905 Wilson learned that Arnold-Forster (Secretary of State for War) thought him the <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> but on 12 July Lyttelton (Chief of the General Staff), who appears to have disliked Wilson, raised the job to a brigadier-general’s position, for which Wilson was not yet senior enough.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1978 with The Pickwick Papers, Keeping took on {{the mammoth}} task of {{illustrating}} the complete works of Charles Dickens for the Folio Society. His knowledge of the vanishing world of industrial London made him the perfect <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> The books were originally to be produced by letterpress printing, meaning the illustrations must be pure line drawings with no tones or washes. When they came to be published more modern printing techniques were used which would have allowed Keeping {{a full range of}} tones, but he had started with line drawings, so he used the same technique for the entire series, illustrating two books a year until he completed the task with Martin Chuzzlewit in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Lisch's {{production}} {{dropped off}} as the 2016–17 season came to a close, with the Kings management putting {{it down to a}} mixture of niggling injuries, his workload, and the fact that he'd just come off an Olympic campaign with the Australian Boomers in August 2016. Aimed at resolving a nagging injury that curtailed his performance in 2016–17, Lisch underwent minor knee surgery during the off-season, with a healthy Kevin Lisch being the recipe for Sydney Kings success in 2017–18 according to Kings Managing Director Jeff Van Groningen. The Kings front office remained confident during the 2017 off-season that Lisch was the <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> despite calls for the Kings to go after the likes of Jerome Randle or Casper Ware. After an off-season of rest and a training schedule refinement, Lisch entered the 2017–18 season ready to redeem himself.|$|E
50|$|The {{members of}} the Third Augustan Legion did not solely consist of {{military}} men. The Emperors actually {{made an effort to}} recruit some men that were experts in surveying and the mathematics of construction. There is good evidence of this from emperors like Augustan, Hadrian and Trajan, who all held engineers responsible for both construction and the military. There were not always many of these talented men in Northern Africa so it was important to train other <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> Thus over time the army became a place to learn the technical skills of engineering and surveying. These men would become involved {{in the construction of the}} big duties like canals or aqueducts.|$|R

25|$|On June 23, 2010, President Obama {{announced}} that he would nominate Petraeus to succeed General Stanley A. McChrystal as the commander of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan. The change of command was prompted by McChrystal's comments about the Obama administration and its policies in Afghanistan during an interview with Rolling Stone magazine. The nomination was technically a positional step down from his position as commander of Central Command, however the President said that he believed that he was the best <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> After being confirmed by the Senate on June 30, Petraeus formally assumed command on July 4. During the assumption of command remarks, Petraeus provided his vision and goals to NATO, the members of his command, and his Afghan partners. As he was known to do while the Commander in Iraq, Petraeus delivered his first Letter to the Troops on the same day he assumed command.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} {{threat from}} Polish forces generated calls for attacks on Warsaw. This {{had been planned}} for the first day, codenamed Wasserkante, or Operation Seaside. Just after midnight on 12/13 September, the Luftwaffe chief of staff Hans Jeschonnek ordered Löhr to prepare to attack ghettos in northern Warsaw, in retaliation for unspecified war crimes against German soldiers in recent battles. Richthofen's airmen flew 183 to 197 sorties, dropping Equal quantities of high explosives and incendiaries. Some bombs fell close to German forces conducting the Siege of Warsaw, and smoke {{made it impossible to}} assess damage. Richthofen confronted Hermann Göring over the need for a united air command for the Warsaw campaign, and hinted he was the <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> He did not get his way until 21 September. Weather delayed the attack, which began on 22 September. Richthofen did not get the aircraft he wanted for the operation, in particular the Heinkel He 111, and instead was handed old Junkers Ju 52 transports, which delivered bombs by airmen throwing them out of the doors. His Ju 87s were also banned from using bomb loads greater than 50kg. On 22 September, Richthofen's command flew 620 sorties. German air units dropped 560 tonnes of high explosive and 72 tonnes of incendiaries. The bombing did great damage, causing 40,000 casualties and destroying one in ten of the buildings in the city, while only two Ju 87s and one Ju 52 were lost.|$|E
500|$|Dormand had a {{difficult}} job in trying to unite a fractious Parliamentary party {{at a time when}} the Labour Party was growing unpopular. In November 1982, amidst rumours that a majority of Labour MPs wanted to replace party leader Michael Foot, Dormand gave a radio interview insisting that [...] "I have absolutely no doubt whatever that the vast majority think that Michael Foot is the <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> at the moment, and will take us into the next general election". In response, Foot's critics noted Dormand's use of the words [...] "at the moment".|$|E

5000|$|Esquirol {{was made}} médecin ordinaire at the Salpêtrière in 1811, {{following}} the death of Jean-Baptiste Pussin, Pinel's trusted concierge. Pinel chose Esquirol because he was, as Pinel put it, [...] "a physician... devoted exclusively to the study of insanity," [...] arguing that with his many years of maison de santé experience he was <b>the</b> only <b>man</b> suited <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b>|$|R

500|$|Detzner's {{mission was}} {{also to be}} the first serious attempt to explore the unknown {{interior}} and to evaluate and describe its contents. The boundary between Papua and Kaiser Wilhelmsland had been broadly established by a joint British-German expedition in 1909, but the interior had not been mapped and the German colonial administration maintained that the boundary was imprecise. [...] Since then, Papuan gold prospectors may have crossed into the German territory which, from the German perspective, made the accuracy of the border essential. [...] Detzner had had experience in joint operations in Kamerun in 1907–08 and could be expected to understand the challenges faced by the previous commission; he had a reputation as a methodical and precise engineer. [...] Although small, he was tough and wiry, extremely focused and determined, and seemed like the right <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{the lead}} up to the airing of the series, Atwell made several {{appearances}} as Carter in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s second season. Footage from the first episode was shown at New York Comic Con on October 10, 2014, and again in ABC's one-hour television special, , which aired in November 2014. The first teaser for the series debuted during Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on October 28, 2014, with the tagline [...] "Sometimes the best <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> ... is a woman." [...] Though the trailer itself was received positively, the tagline was criticized as [...] "awful" [...] and [...] "ridiculous", and Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said [...] "I get {{that one of the}} themes of the show will be Peggy dealing with the sexism of the time, but these ads exist in 2014, not 1945.

500|$|Governor Reagan's term {{ended in}} 1975, {{and he did}} not run for a third; instead, he met with advisors to discuss a {{possible}} bid for the presidency in 1976, challenging incumbent President Gerald Ford. Ronald still needed to convince a reluctant Nancy before running, however. She feared for her husband's health and his career as a whole, though she felt that he was the right <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> and eventually approved. Nancy took on a more traditional role in the campaign, holding coffees, luncheons, and talks, with senior citizens. With that, she oversaw personnel, monitored her husband's schedule, and occasionally provided press conferences. The 1976 campaign included the so-called [...] "battle of the queens", contrasting Nancy with First Lady Betty Ford. They both spoke out {{over the course of the}} campaign on similar issues, but with different approaches. Nancy was particularly upset by the warmonger image that the Ford campaign had drawn of her husband.|$|E
5000|$|This time {{a better}} class of {{commando}} was sought so an approach {{was made to}} King Zog in exile in Cairo to recommend <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> But British negotiator Neil 'Billy' McLean and American representatives Robert Miner and Robert Low were unable to bring Zog in because no one would name him head of a provisional government in exile. In August 1949, an announcement was made in Paris that Albanian political exiles had formed a multiparty committee to foment anticommunist rebellion in the homeland; actually the [...] "Free Albania" [...] National Committee was created by American diplomatic and intelligence officials for political cover to a covert paramilitary project, with British concurrence. The British made the first organizational move, hiring on as chief trainer Maj. David Smiley, deputy commander of a cavalry (tank) regiment stationed in Germany. Already agreed with McLean and his cohort, Julian Amery, to supply 30 Albanian emigres as recruits <b>for</b> <b>the</b> operation to penetrate Albania were leaders of the Balli Kombetar, an exile political group whose key policy was to replace the Albanian Communist regime with a non-royalist government.|$|R

They seek help from Frost's ex-boyfriend Joseph Manfredi, a crime lord, who gives them <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> in exchange <b>for</b> Chadwick's influence in the media. Carter, Jarvis, Sousa and some SSR allies break into the Roxxon facility holding the bombs and disable them before Frost can reach them.

Sousa accidentally reveals to his new fiance that he loves Carter, and while Wilkes comforts Carter as she recuperates, his form begins to fade away.|$|R
50|$|In 1943 Anne Loughlin {{was made}} a DBE, an honour she {{accepted}} {{in the belief that}} it would open doors <b>for</b> <b>the</b> union.

500|$|After a month out of work, Westley rejoined Stevenage on 30 March 2013, {{his third}} spell in charge at the club. On the appointment, Stevenage {{chairman}} Phil Wallace stated [...] "Graham was keen {{to come back}} to Stevenage and, although I met some strong candidates, without doubt I think he’s the best <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> right now. The club enjoyed a great deal of success before he left last year and we moved forwards significantly in his time here on several levels". On his return, Westley said [...] "I'm really happy to be back, the training ground is fantastic, the club just keeps moving forward. All the facilities keep improving and I hope that I can come back and make another positive difference". In his first game back in charge of the club, Stevenage secured a 1–0 victory over Hartlepool United on 1 April.

500|$|Groves {{told them}} {{that he was looking}} for someone with [...] "a sound {{understanding}} of both practical and theoretical ordnance– high explosives, guns and fusing– a wide acquaintance and an excellent reputation among military ordnance people and an ability to gain their support; a reasonably broad background in scientific development; and an ability to attract and hold the respect of scientists." [...] He said that a military officer would be his ideal, as the job might involve planning and coordinating the use of the bomb, but added that he knew of no Army officer who fit the bill. Bush then suggested Parsons, a nomination supported by Purnell. The next morning, Parsons {{received a phone call from}} Purnell, ordering him to report to Admiral King, who was now the Commander in Chief, US Fleet (Cominch).

500|$|In 1971 the Philadelphia Flyers {{were looking}} for a new coach, and general manager Keith Allen {{suggested}} Shero to owner Ed Snider.

He knew Shero always had a winning record, plus he had a [...] "gut feeling" [...] he was the right <b>man</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> Snider agreed to bring in Shero because he trusted Allen's judgment. Thus Shero became the third coach in Flyers history; he had high hopes for the Season predicting that the Flyers would finish no worse than second in the West Division. The 1971–72 season was disappointing for Shero as the Flyers finished in 5th place in the West with a 26–38–14 record. The Flyers 66 points were actually a decrease of 7 points in the standings and they missed the playoffs {{for the second time in}} three years. Shero's [...] "Fog" [...] nickname was also re-established during the year following a game at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta when he left the arena through a door with no re-entry and became locked outside prior to the post-game press conference. At the press conference no one knew where Shero was and reporters unsuccessfully searched the arena for him.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the above}} {{gives us an}} {{overview}} of what a goal is and what constitute a good goal, we might often find it useful to identify the personal habits which can propel our human performance and thus achievement higher or {{to the next level}} or to achieve the next goal or objective.
