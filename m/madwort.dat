50|$|Some of {{the common}} names reflect its close {{relationship}} and resemblance to species of Alyssum. Common names include basket of gold, goldentuft alyssum, golden alyssum, golden alison, gold-dust, golden-tuft alyssum, golden-tuft <b>madwort,</b> rock <b>madwort.</b>|$|E
50|$|Asperugo procumbens, {{known as}} <b>madwort</b> or German <b>madwort,</b> {{is the single}} species in the {{monotypic}} plant genus Asperugo. This plant is native to Europe but has been introduced elsewhere, such as the northern half of North America.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Madwort</b> is {{a common}} name for several plants and may refer to: ...|$|E
5000|$|Alyssum alyssoides is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the mustard family known by several common names, including pale <b>madwort</b> and yellow alyssum. It is native to Eurasia, {{but it can be}} found throughout much of the temperate world as an introduced species and sometimes a common weed.|$|E
50|$|Berteroa incana is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the mustard family, Brassicaceae. Its common names include hoary alyssum, false hoary <b>madwort,</b> hoary berteroa, and hoary alison. It is native to Eurasia {{and it has been}} introduced to western Europe and North America. It is listed as an invasive noxious weed in some areas of United States.|$|E
50|$|Alyssum spinosum, now Hormathophylla spinosa (spiny <b>madwort)</b> is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} subshrub in the genus Alyssum of the family Brassicaceae, native to open rocky sites in south-eastern France and southern Spain. It forms a compact mound up to 30 cm in height. Dense spiny branches of tiny, toothed grey-green leaves bear racemes of white flowers at the tips in early summer.|$|E
50|$|Alyssum desertorum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the mustard family known by the common name desert <b>madwort.</b> It is native to Europe and Asia, and it is found in parts of western North America as an introduced species and sometimes a weed. This is a hairy annual herb producing upright stems up to about 20 centimeters tall. It produces small yellowish flowers and round, notched fruits a few millimeters long. The seeds are winged and have embryonic roots.|$|E
5000|$|One {{example of}} {{functional}} equivalence is demonstrated in plant-pollinator relationships, whereby a certain plant species may evolve flower morphology that selects for pollination {{by a host}} of taxonomically-unrelated species to provide the same function (fruit production following pollination). For example, the herbaceous plant spiny <b>madwort</b> (Hermathophylla spinosa) grows flowers that are shaped so that taxonomically unrelated pollinators behave almost identically during pollination. From the plant's perspective, each of these pollinators are functionally equivalent and thus are not subjected to specific selective pressures [...] Variation in the shape and structure of both flower and seed morphology can be a source of selective pressure for animal species to evolve a variety of morphological features, yet also provide the same function to the plant.|$|E
40|$|Nickel (Ni) is {{essential}} for all plants due to its role in urease activation. Demonstration of Ni essentiality has required exceptional effort to purify nutrient solutions to remove Ni; thus, an improved technique would make study of Ni deficiency more available to diverse researchers. As part of our research on Ni hyperaccumulation by plants, we developed chelator-buffered nutrient solutions with very low buffered activity of free Ni 2 +, and tested growth of Alyssum murale (Goldentuft <b>Madwort),</b> A. corsicum (<b>Madwort),</b> A. montanum (Mountain Alyssum) and Lycopersicon esculentum (Tomato). We used a modified Hoagland nutrient solution with 2 mM Mg and 1 mM Ca to simulate serpentine soil solutions. We could use hydroxyethyl-ethylene-diaminetriacetate (HEDTA) to achieve Ni 2 + activity levels as low as 10 - 16 M, and cyclohexane-ethylenediamine-tetraacetate (CDTA) to supply higher activities of buffered Ni 2 + compared with HEDTA; however, {{we were unable to}} obtain proof of induced Ni-deficiency, even with urea-N supply in a 6 -week growth period, apparently because seeds supplied enough Ni for growth. Yields were somewhat reduced at lower Ni activity {{by the end of the}} test period, but strong deficiency symptoms did not occur, apparently due to the supply of Ni from hyperaccumulator species seeds (contained 7000 â€“ 9000 mg Ni kg- 1). Chelator buffering supplied controlled levels of Ni 2 + for all test species; very low plant Ni levels were attained when seed Ni was low. Reaching clear and strong Ni deficiency appears to require longer growing periods, using seed with exceedingly low initial endogenous Ni, or species possessing higher Ni requirements...|$|E
