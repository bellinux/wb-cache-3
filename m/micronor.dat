5000|$|The {{design of}} the Argus 400 started {{at the same time}} as the Argus 300. In logical terms the 400 was similar to the earlier 100, using serial ALUs. However, it {{featured}} an entirely new electrical system. Previous machines used germanium transistors to form the logic gates. The Argus 400 used silicon transistors in a NOR-logic designed by Ferranti Wythenshawe called <b>MicroNOR</b> II, with more [...] "conventional" [...] logic where 0 and +4.5 represented binary 1 and 0, respectively. The rest of the world however used 0 volts to represent 0 and + 2.4 (to 5) volts to represent 1. This was called NAND logic. They are in fact both the same circuitry. When Texas Instruments brought out their “74” series of integrated circuits the specification of <b>MicroNOR</b> II was changed from 4.5 volts to 5 volts so the two families could work together. The machine was packaged to fit into a standard Air Transport Rack. Multilayer PCBs were not routine in 1963 and Ferranti developed processes for bonding the boards and plating through the circuit boards. The drawing office had to learn how to design multilayer boards. which was first laid out on tape then transferred to film. It took around two years for the Argus 400 to go into production.|$|E
5000|$|PFLI President Karen Brauer (MS, RPh) {{was fired}} in 1996 from a Kmart in Hamilton, Ohio. According to Brauer, a Roman Catholicshe was fired when she refused to sign an {{agreement}} that she would dispense all lawfully prescribed medications regardless of her feelings or beliefs. The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) represented Brauer and filed suit against Kmart in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati in August 1999. In January 2001, the court refused to dismiss the suit at Kmart's request and ruled that Brauer's case could go forward under Ohio's conscience law. On April 16, 2001 in an appearance on Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor, Brauer acknowledged {{that she did not}} directly decline or refuse to fill the prescription but, rather, lied to the customer by saying the pharmacy was out of stock of the contraceptive in question (<b>Micronor),</b> which Brauer holds is designed to [...] "terminate a human life that has already begun". When the customer learned the truth she complained to the store's management, which led to the incident which in turn resulted in Brauer's lawsuit.|$|E
5000|$|Certain medications, {{particularly}} contraceptive medications, can induce amenorrhoea in {{a healthy}} woman. The lack of menstruation usually begins shortly after beginning the medication and {{can take up to}} a year to resume after stopping a medication. Hormonal contraceptives that contain only progestogen like the oral contraceptive <b>Micronor,</b> and especially higher-dose formulations like the injectable Depo Provera commonly induce this side-effect. Extended cycle use of combined hormonal contraceptives also allow suppression of menstruation. Patients who use and then cease using contraceptives like the combined oral contraceptive pill may experience secondary amenorrhoea as a withdrawal symptom. The link is not well understood, as studies have found no difference in hormone levels between women who develop amenorrhoea as a withdrawal symptom following the cessation of OCOP use and women who experience secondary amenorrhoea because of other reasons. [...] New contraceptive pills, like continuous oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) which do not have the normal 7 days of placebo pills in each cycle, have been shown to increase rates of amenorrhoea in women. Studies show that women are most likely to experience amenorrhoea after 1 year of treatment with continuous OCP use.|$|E
40|$|Effects of a {{progestogen}} and a sequential type {{oral contraceptive}} on plasma vitamin A, vitamin E, cholesterol and triglycerides 1 D. L. Yeung, Ph. D., 2 and P. L. Chan, M. D., M. R. C. O. G., F. RC. S. (C) 3 ABSTRACT Fasting blood samples {{were taken from}} 13 college students {{who had never been}} on oral contraceptives in two mentrual cycles. During the first cycle, the control cycle, each girl donated three blood samples: the first sample was given between days I and 5, the second sample between days 13 and 17, and the third sample between days 22 and 26 of the menstrual cycle. In the second menstrual cycle, the experimental cycle, nine girls were given <b>Micronor,</b> a progestogen type oral contraceptive and four girls were given Ortho-Novum SQ. a sequential type oral contraceptive. Four blood samples were obtained from each of the subjects: the first three samples were obtained in the three periods corresponding to those in the control cycle, and the fourth was taken 2 days after the subjects had stopped taking the oral contraceptives. Results showed that estrogen significantly raised plasma vitamin A and triglycerides. The progestogen, at low concentration, had little or no effect on these two lipid materials. At a higher concentration the progestogen enhanced the effect o...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{etiology}} of female infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss, in some women remains unclear and a scientific challenge. This study {{was carried out}} to investigate the qualitative phytochemical analysis, in-vitro and in-vivo antioxidant property of the ethanolic extract of Byrsocarpus coccineus leaves. This {{was based on the}} traditional claims, that it is used for the treatment of idiopathic infertility case in females with high body temperature which most times does not favors successful pregnancy. DESIGN: Qualitative phytochemical screening was performed using standard procedures as described by Dipali and Vilas, (2013). In-vitro antioxidant assay of DPPH- 2, 2 -Diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazine hydrate radical scavenging activity, Hydrogen Peroxide Scavenging Activity (HPSA) and Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) were determined. In-vivo antioxidant activity investigated was catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lipid peroxidation. Ethanolic extract of Byrsocarpus coccineus were administered orally for 14 days to the Wister rats in the groups, including female rats induced with temporary infertility with <b>Micronor</b> (MIC) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for 7 days before the administration of the extract. Results obtained showed that the ethanolic extract of B. coccineus leaves possesses effective antioxidant properties both in-vitro and in-vivo. RESULT / OUTCOME:The phytochemical analysis of the extracts showed the presence of alkaloids, terpenoids, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, resins, phenols and reducing sugars. The extract showed 78. 28 % inhibition of DPPH, 71. 57 % of HPSA and 97. 95 % TAC at 250 µg/ml concentrations. Also, the extract significantly causes reduction of the activities of CAT (0. 207 ± 0. 060 U/ml), SOD (3. 83 ± 0. 268 U/ml) and lipid peroxidation (1. 1...|$|E
