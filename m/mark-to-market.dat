25|$|However, an October 15, 2008, {{article in}} the Washington Post {{analyzing}} {{the origins of the}} economic crisis claims that Greenspan vehemently opposed any regulation of derivatives, and actively sought to undermine the office of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission when the Commission sought to initiate regulation of derivatives. Meanwhile, Greenspan recommended improving <b>mark-to-market</b> regulations to avoid having derivatives or other complex assets marked to a distressed or illiquid market during times of material adverse conditions seen during the late 2000s credit crisis.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{accounting}} {{change to a}} calendar fiscal year, which created the stub month of December 2008, was required when the firm converted to a bank holding company and declared in Item 5.03 of its Form 8-K U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing of December 15, 2008. The December loss also included a $850 million <b>mark-to-market</b> write-down on loans to chemical maker LyondellBasell since it became clear in December that Lyondell would file for bankruptcy protection {{and would not be}} able to meet its debt obligations.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Mark-to-Market</b> Margin (MTM margin) on {{the other}} hand is the margin {{collected}} to offset losses (if any) that have already been incurred on the positions held by a firm. This is computed as the difference between the cost of the position held and the current market value of that position. If the resulting amount is a loss, the amount is collected from the firm; else, the amount may be returned to the firm (the case with most clearing houses) or kept in reserve depending on local practice. In either case, the positions are 'marked-to-market' by setting their new cost to the market value used in computing this difference. The positions held by the clients of the exchange are marked-to-market daily and the MTM difference computation for the next day would use the new cost figure in its calculation.|$|E
500|$|In Enron's {{natural gas}} business, the {{accounting}} had been fairly straightforward: in each time period, the company listed actual costs of supplying {{the gas and}} actual revenues received from selling it. However, when Skilling joined the company, he demanded that the trading business adopt <b>mark-to-market</b> accounting, citing that it would represent [...] "true economic value." [...] Enron became the first non-financial company to use the method to account for its complex long-term contracts. <b>Mark-to-market</b> accounting requires that once a long-term contract was signed, income is estimated as {{the present value of}} net future cash flow. Often, the viability of these contracts and their related costs were difficult to estimate. Due to the large discrepancies of attempting to match profits and cash, investors were typically given false or misleading reports. While using the method, income from projects could be recorded, although they might not have ever received the money, and in turn increasing financial earnings on the books. However, in future years, the profits could not be included, so new and additional income had to be included from more projects to develop additional growth to appease investors. As one Enron competitor stated, [...] "If you accelerate your income, then you have to keep doing more and more deals to show the same or rising income." [...] Despite potential pitfalls, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the accounting method for Enron in its trading of natural gas futures contracts on January 30, 1992. However, Enron later expanded its use to other areas in the company to help it meet Wall Street projections.|$|E
500|$|The {{combination}} of these issues later resulted in the bankruptcy of the company, {{and the majority of}} them were perpetuated by the indirect knowledge or direct actions of Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, Andrew Fastow, and other executives such as Rebecca Mark. Lay served as the chairman of the company in its last few years, and approved of the actions of Skilling and Fastow although he did not always inquire about the details. Skilling constantly focused on meeting Wall Street expectations, advocated the use of <b>mark-to-market</b> accounting (accounting based on market value, which was then inflated) and pressured Enron executives {{to find new ways to}} hide its debt. Fastow and other executives [...] "created off-balance-sheet vehicles, complex financing structures, and deals so bewildering that few people could understand them." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the flowers}} grew in popularity, {{professional}} growers paid {{higher and higher}} prices for bulbs with the virus, and prices rose steadily. By 1634, in part {{as a result of}} demand from the French, speculators began to enter the market. The contract price of rare bulbs continued to rise throughout 1636, but by November, the price of common, [...] "unbroken" [...] bulbs also began to increase, so that soon any tulip bulb could fetch hundreds of guilders. That year the Dutch created a type of formal futures market where contracts to buy bulbs {{at the end of the}} season were bought and sold. Traders met in [...] "colleges" [...] at taverns and buyers were required to pay a 2.5% [...] "wine money" [...] fee, up to a maximum of three guilders per trade. Neither party paid an initial margin nor a <b>mark-to-market</b> margin, and all contracts were with the individual counter-parties rather than with the Exchange. The Dutch described tulip contract trading as windhandel (literally [...] "wind trade"), because no bulbs were actually changing hands. The entire business was accomplished on the margins of Dutch economic life, not in the Exchange itself.|$|E

[...] "Buy American. I am." [...] he wrote for an opinion piece published in the New York Times in 2008. Buffett called the downturn in the financial sector that started in 2007 [...] "poetic justice". Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway suffered a 77% drop in earnings during Q3 2008 {{and several of his}} later deals suffered large <b>mark-to-market</b> losses.|$|E
2500|$|On July 25, 2012, Weill {{apparently}} reversed {{course on}} the financial supermarket. [...] "What we should probably do is go and split up investment banking from banking, have banks be deposit takers, have banks make commercial loans and real estate loans, have banks do something that’s not going to risk the taxpayer dollars, that's not too big to fail," [...] Weill said on CNBC.

2500|$|The {{discipline}} typically {{focuses on}} risks {{that can be}} hedged using traded financial instruments, typically derivatives; see Cash flow hedge, Foreign exchange hedge, Financial engineering. [...] Because company specific, [...] "over the counter" [...] (OTC) contracts tend to be costly to create and monitor, derivatives that trade on well-established financial markets or exchanges are often preferred. These standard derivative instruments include options, futures contracts, forward contracts, and swaps; the [...] "second generation" [...] exotic derivatives usually trade OTC. [...] Note that hedging-related transactions will attract their own accounting treatment: see Hedge accounting, <b>Mark-to-market</b> accounting, FASB 133, IAS 39.|$|E
2500|$|Berkshire Hathaway {{acquired}} 10% perpetual {{preferred stock}} of Goldman Sachs. Some of Buffett's put options (European exercise at expiry only) {{that he wrote}} (sold) were running at around $6.73billion <b>mark-to-market</b> losses as of late 2008. The scale of the potential loss prompted the SEC to demand that Berkshire produce, [...] "a more robust disclosure" [...] of factors used to value the contracts. Buffett also helped Dow Chemical pay for its $18.8billion takeover of Rohm & Haas. He thus became the single largest shareholder in the enlarged group with his Berkshire Hathaway, which provided $3billion, underlining his instrumental role during the crisis in debt and equity markets.|$|E
2500|$|Bates College is a tax-exempt {{organization}} that complies with section 501(c) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.

This move allowed Enron to <b>mark-to-market</b> a portion of a related gas contract and post a $65 million <b>mark-to-market</b> income for the second half of 1999.

50|$|<b>Mark-to-market</b> {{accounting}} {{can change}} values {{on the balance}} sheet as market conditions change. In contrast, historical cost accounting, based on the past transactions, is simpler, more stable, and easier to perform, but does not represent current market value. It summarizes past transactions instead. <b>Mark-to-market</b> accounting can become volatile if market prices fluctuate greatly or change unpredictably. Buyers and sellers may claim a number of specific instances when this is the case, including inability to value the future income and expenses both accurately and collectively, often due to unreliable information, or over-optimistic or over-pessimistic expectations of cash flow and earnings.|$|E

50|$|IAS39 {{requires}} that all derivatives are marked-to-market {{with changes in}} the <b>mark-to-market</b> being taken to the profit and loss account. For many entities this {{would result in a}} significant amount of profit and loss volatility arising from the use of derivatives.|$|E
50|$|The VaR {{risk measure}} defines risk as <b>mark-to-market</b> loss {{on a fixed}} {{portfolio}} over a fixed time horizon. There are many alternative risk measures in finance. Given the inability to use <b>mark-to-market</b> (which uses market prices to define loss) for future performance, loss is often defined (as a substitute) as change in fundamental value. For example, if an institution holds a loan that declines in market price because interest rates go up, but has no change in cash flows or credit quality, some systems do not recognize a loss. Also some try to incorporate the economic cost of harm not measured in daily financial statements, such as loss of market confidence or employee morale, impairment of brand names or lawsuits.|$|E
