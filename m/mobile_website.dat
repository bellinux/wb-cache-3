5|$|In 2004, Tecmo began {{releasing}} low-priced episodic installments of Ninja Gaiden for AT and Verizon {{mobile phones}} on both BREW and Java platforms. The official English Tecmo Games <b>mobile</b> <b>website</b> advertised {{it for a}} future release along with a mobile version of Tecmo Bowl. They planned to release the entire game throughout 2004 {{in a series of}} four installments – similar to what Upstart Games did when they ported the NES version of Castlevania to mobile phones. The port featured the same visuals and soundtrack found on the NES version, and each installment was to consist of several levels of gameplay at a time. The first installment, titled Ninja Gaiden EpisodeI: Destiny, was released on , and it included only the first Act from the NES version but added two new levels. The second installment was planned to be released in North America and was previewed by GameSpot in September 2004, but it – along with the third and fourth installments – was never released.|$|E

25|$|Preparation for {{development}} of the next Persona title began in 2010. Rumors of its development were floating around since 2009, when Sony's <b>mobile</b> <b>website</b> listed Katsura Hashino as the game's director. According to another source, preparatory work {{was going on in}} 2008 while Persona 4 was still in development. Preparatory development was nearing completion in August 2011, with full development beginning after that following the completion of Catherine. Hashino was only fully involved in development after Catherine was finished, later calling the latter game a test for the next Persona title's development. Development lasted five years. When production started, the staff consisted of around 40 people. During full production, this number expanded to 70: 15 planners, 15 programmers, and between 30 and 45 designers. These included the game's lead designer Naoya Maeda, who had previously done modelling work for the Trauma Team series. The general development was a challenge for the team, as they intentionally changed their development structure due to the more powerful hardware they were working with.|$|E

Hyphen wrote that Whitlock [...] "reinforced the insipid and insidious 'small Asian penis' stereotype". The Asian American Journalists Association demanded an apology. [...] "I debased a feel-good sports moment. For that, I'm truly sorry," [...] apologized Whitlock. Boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr. wrote on his Twitter page, [...] "Jeremy Lin is a good player but all the hype is because he's Asian. Black players do what he does every night and don't get the same praise." [...] NBCNewYork.com in response to Mayweather noted that [...] "no one of any skin color in the history of basketball has done in their first four starts what Lin pulled off for the Knicks last week." [...] On February 15, the MSG Network during game coverage showed a fan's sign of Lin's face above a fortune cookie with the words [...] "The Knicks Good Fortune", which some viewed as an ethnic stereotype. Sporting News wrote that the sign was [...] "questionable", while CBS News called it [...] "distasteful". Some Knicks teammates were criticized for bowing to Lin during games. On February 17, ESPN used a racial slur on its <b>mobile</b> <b>website</b> in the headline [...] "Chink in the Armor" [...] after Lin had nine turnovers in New York's loss to the Hornets. It was removed 35minutes later, and ESPN apologized. The network fired the employee who posted the headline, and suspended ESPNews anchor Max Bretos for using the same reference earlier in the week. Bretos also apologized. Knicks radio announcer Spero Dedes also used the phrase on 1050 ESPN New York, but he was an employee of Madison Square Garden (MSG) and not ESPN. He apologized and was disciplined by MSG.|$|E
