500|$|After a {{slow start}} to the 2009–10 season, the Hornets fired coach Byron Scott. Paul stirred up {{controversy}} when he announced his displeasure with the move, commenting that team management should have [...] "consulted with <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> how I felt before it happened." [...] In early February, 2010, Paul tore cartilage in his left knee and was sidelined for over a month by surgery, forcing him to miss the All-Star Game. In total, he played in only 45 games and his averages dropped to 18.7 points, 3.8 rebounds, 10.7 assists, and 2.1 steals per game. Without Paul, the Hornets struggled, missing the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|... "Badlaa" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{inspired}} by stories of Indian fakirs. In fact, the episode's title means [...] "to retort" [...] or [...] "to revenge" [...] in Urdu. Further inspiration came [...] "from {{a little bit of}} desperation" [...] according to Shiban. He later recalled that he was walking through the Vancouver airport and suddenly had the thought, [...] "What if someone who came up to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> me for money was actually a bad guy." [...] Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist with a different power. He explained, [...] "My original idea was a beggar with no legs who can actually shrink himself and climb inside your ear, and Chris Carter–and this is why he's Chris Carter–said 'No, no, no! I know what's even better.'" [...] Shiban later said that [...] "... one thing about this episode that I'm sort of proud is that people often have told me that it is the most disgusting thought that they ever had, that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Your Pusher" [...] sees Ice-T dissing fellow rapper LL Cool J. Ice-T {{explained}} {{later that}} he felt that LL Cool J was [...] "at that time on his 'I'm the great rapper in the world' thing. Me being from L.A., I was trying to rep our entire city alone, so had to step to him". Ice-T also replied {{that he had no}} personal problem with him but just [...] "thought I could beat him rapping anyways". Ice-T stated that he recorded [...] "Girls L.G.B.N.A.F." [...] as a humorous response to LL Cool J's song [...] "I Need Love". Ice-T stated that: [...] "Girls came to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked,</b> 'Ice, why don't you write a ballad'? Now can you imagine saying, 'I need loooove?' That's a wimp. So I wrote ('Girls') as a joke." [...] LL Cool J later retaliated [...] dissing Ice-T in his song [...] "To da Break of Dawn" [...] from his album Mama Said Knock You Out (1990). Afrika Islam said their feud ended when a group meeting involving Flavor Flav, DJ Red Alert, Mike Tyson and Afrika Bambaataa persuaded them to stop fighting. Islam explained Tyson's role: [...] " [...] down with hip-hop and the Zulus and I've always considered rappers like boxers anyway". Ice-T commented on the feud in NME magazine in 2012, stating: [...] "You need a nemesis in hip hop. It's part of what fuels good rap. L was coming out of New York saying he was the best rapper in the world. I was trying to get my feet out of LA. You can't have someone saying they're the best if you're trying to. We had a little hip hop thing but it was never serious." ...|$|E

2500|$|Charles Grean of Dot Records had {{arranged}} with {{the studio to}} do an album of space music based on music from Star Trek, {{and he has a}} teenage daughter who's a fan of the show and a fan of Mr. Spock. She said, 'Well, if you're going to do an album of music from Star Trek, then Mr. Spock should be on the album.' So Dot contacted <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> me if I would be interested in either speaking or singing on the record. I said I was very interested in doing both. ...That was the first album we did, which was called Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space.

2500|$|The limited series Agents of Atlas #1-6 (Oct. 2006 - March 2007) {{was set in}} {{the present}} day and {{likewise}} set in mainstream continuity.

Paniccia says the idea came to him when he picked up a copy of the What if? story and found the cover [...] "intriguing; it instantly tickles the nostalgia bone".|$|E
2500|$|Stephenson {{was very}} much one of the {{professionals}} and even as captain had little time for the stuffier county cricket element. There were run-ins with the county establishment. Cricket writer David Foot in an obituary of Stephenson reported [...] "one corrosive exchange with the county chairman, Bunty Longrigg". Foot reports Stephenson as saying: [...] "It was my fifth year in charge and we'd got to the Bath Festival. The chairman approached <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> me bluntly who I thought we should leave out {{to make way for}} an amateur or two.

2500|$|Ja’far’s widow Asma recalled: “God’s Messenger came to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked,</b> ‘Where are Jafar’s children?’ I {{brought them}} {{to him and he}} embraced them and smelled them, then his eyes welled up and he cried. ‘O God’s Messenger,’ I asked, ‘Have you heard {{something}} about Jafar?’ ‘Yes,’ he replied. ‘He was killed today.’ I stood up and screamed, and the women came to me. The Prophet began to say, ‘O Asma, do not speak obscene words or beat your chest!’” Her son Abdullah remembered: “He said, ‘O Asma, will you not rejoice? Indeed, God most high has made two wings for Ja’far, that he may fly with them in Paradise!’” Then Muhammad told his daughter Fatima, “Prepare food for the family of Ja’far, for they are preoccupied today.” ...|$|E

Marty Shea, the booking agent for the Columbia, came to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> if I wanted to play burlesque. They could use an extra attraction....I told him I would think about it, but 'Burlesque' sounded to me then as something funny." [...] Shea and Sam A. Scribner, the general manager of the Columbia Amusement Company, approached Rogers a few days later. Shea told Scribner Rogers was getting $150 and would take $175.

2500|$|In 2005, Wales {{described}} himself {{simply as the}} founder of Wikipedia; however, according to Brian Bergstein of the Associated Press, [...] "Sanger has long been cited as a co-founder." [...] There is evidence that Sanger was called co-founder, along with Wales, as early as 2001, and he {{is referred to as}} such in early Wikipedia press releases and Wikipedia articles and in a September 2001 New York Times article for which both were interviewed. In 2006, Wales said, [...] "He used to work for me [...] I don't agree with calling him a co-founder, but he likes the title"; nonetheless, before January 2004, Wales did not dispute Sanger's status as co-founder and, indeed, identified himself as [...] "co-founder" [...] as late as August 2002. In Sanger's introductory message to the Nupedia mailing list, he said that [...] "Jimmy Wales contacted <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> me to apply as editor-in-chief of Nupedia. Apparently, Bomis, Inc. (which owns Nupedia)... who could manage this sort of long-term project, he thought I would be perfect for the job. This is indeed my dream job". Sanger said [...] "He [...] had had the idea for Nupedia since at least last fall".|$|E
2500|$|... “While we {{were showing}} in Birmingham, England, a little {{daughter}} was born to us. [...] The morning papers discussed the event in big headlines that the first full-blooded Indian baby had been born at the Buffalo Bill grounds. [...] Colonel Cody was to be its godfather, and the baby was named after the reigning Queen of England. [...] The child’s full name was to be Alexandra Birmingham Cody Standing Bear. [...] The next morning Cody came to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> if my wife and baby could {{be placed in the}} side-show. [...] He said the English people {{would like to see the}} face of a newly born Indian baby lying in an Indian cradle or ‘hoksicalaa postan.' [...] I gave my consent, and the afternoon papers stated that the baby and mother could be seen the following afternoon. [...] Long before it was time for the show to begin, people were lining up on the road. [...] My wife sat on the raised platform, with the little one in the cradle before her. [...] The people filed past, many of them dropping money in a box for her. [...] It was a great drawing card for the show; the work was very light for my wife, and as for the baby, before she was twenty-four hours old she was making more money than my wife and I together." ...|$|E

2500|$|The most remembered shot where Davis {{missed the}} fine {{cut into the}} corner pocket was {{unfortunately}} not discussed in detail. Davis states [...] "I was saying to myself, don't hit it thick" [...] and [...] "that's how you bottle it, by hitting it thick." [...] However he did not elaborate on whether {{he was forced to}} use side spin to avoid a possible in off foul stroke into the middle pocket (This would have cost him the match) or whether he played it with centre ball striking. He summarised: [...] "although I missed the black, it wasn't that shot which lost the match. There were other shots earlier in the frame." [...] In particular, Davis mentions how close he was to being able to pot a pink which he snookered himself on that changed the course of the match. David Vine closes the programme by asking both players their opinion regarding some voices claiming the match must have been fixed. This preposterous notion gives a fascinating insight into the prevailing naivety in some quarters with regard to Snooker in 1985, when it was still a comparatively young TV sport and reaching its zenith in popularity. Davis replies [...] "Well, its simple. They don't understand. If anyone ever came up to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> if the match was fixed, I would just say yeah it was, yeah. It's just not even worth arguing with people like that." [...] Davis allowed himself to joke about the defeat, making a joke about being asked by a petrol station attendant if he wanted glasses (free tumblers) and has now admitted that he will probably be remembered more for the final he did not win in 1985 than for the six he did. But barely months after the final he states [...] "although I lost the match, it was great to be involved in. To be involved in something like that." [...] The programme was later released on DVD as [...] "The Greatest Snooker Final Of All Time" [...] by Retro Videos. Both players now commentate on BBC's snooker coverage and are often reminded of that match. The [...] finish was voted the ninth greatest sporting moment of all time in a 2002 Channel 4 poll.|$|E
