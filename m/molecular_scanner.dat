40|$|INTRODUCTION The <b>molecular</b> <b>scanner</b> {{offers a}} {{flexible}} and powerful visualization tool that {{can create a}} fully annotated 2 D gel electrophoresis map. Proteins separated by 2 D gel electrophoresis are simultaneously digested while undergoing electrotransfer from the gel to a membrane. The peptides are subjected to peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) analysis to identify proteins directly from the PVDF membranes by MALDI-TOF-MS scanning. An ensemble of dedicated tools is then used to create, analyze, and visualize a proteome as a multidimensional image. The <b>molecular</b> <b>scanner</b> method reduces to a minimum the sample handling prior to mass analysis and decreases the sample size to a few tens of micrometers, that is, {{the size of the}} MALDI-TOF-MS laser beam impact. The process can be divided into four parts: separation and digestion of proteins, acquisition of PMF data, processing of the MS data and protein identification, and creation of multidimensional proteome maps...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>molecular</b> <b>scanner</b> {{combines}} protein separation using {{gel electrophoresis}} with peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) techniques to identify proteins {{in a highly}} automated manner. Proteins separated in a 2 -dimensional polyacrylamide gel (2 -D PAGE) are digested in parallel and transferred onto a membrane keeping their relative positions. The membrane is then sprayed with a matrix and inserted into a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer, which measures a peptide mass fingerprint at each site on the scanned grid. First, visualization of PMF data allows surveying all fingerprints at once and provides very useful information {{on the presence of}} chemical noise. Chemical noise is shown to be a potential source for erroneous identifications and is therefore purged from the mass fingerprints. Then, the correlation between neighboring spectra is used to recalibrate the peptide masses. Finally, a method that clusters peptide masses according to the similarity of the spatial distributions of their signal intensities is presented. This method allows discarding many of the false positives that usually go along with PMF identifications and allows identifying many weakly expressed proteins present in the gel...|$|E
40|$|Identification and {{characterization}} of all proteins expressed by a genome in biological samples represent major challenges in proteomics. Today's commonly used high-throughput approaches combine two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) with peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) analysis. Although automation is often possible, {{a number of}} limitations still adversely affect the rate of protein identification and annotation in 2 -DE databases: the sequential excision process of pieces of gel containing protein; the enzymatic digestion step; the interpretation of mass spectra (reliability of identifications); and the manual updating of 2 -DE databases. We present a highly automated method that generates a fully annoated 2 -DE map. Using a parallel process, all proteins of a 2 -DE are first simultaneously digested proteolytically and electro-transferred onto a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane. The membrane is then directly scanned by MALDI-TOF MS. After automated protein identification from the obtained peptide mass fingerprints using PeptIdent software ([URL] + ++), a fully annotated 2 -D map is created on-line. It is a multidimensional representation of a proteome that contains interpreted PMF data in addition to protein identification results. This "MS-imaging" method represents a major step toward {{the development of a}} clinical <b>molecular</b> <b>scanner...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{and application}} of two new alkylating reagents, N-tert-butyl- 2 -iodoacetamide (N-t-butyliodoacetamide) and 2 -iodo-N-phenylacetamide (iodoacetanilide), are described. N-t-Butyliodoacetamide and iodoacetanilide were synthesised to purity in their d(0) -light and in their respective d(9) - and d(5) -heavy forms. The newly synthesised reagents are covalently bound to peptides containing cysteines via an alkylation reaction. The mass differences of 5 and 9 Da avoid possible problems of overlapping isotope distribution. For each alkylated cysteine a peptide mass increases, respectively, by a multiple of 113 and 133 Da for the d(0) -light form of N-t-butyliodoacetamide and iodoacetanilide. These reagents can therefore replace common alkylating reagents in existing proteomics-based applications. Alkylated peptides increase in mass in the same mass range as amino acids and remain suitable for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data acquisition and analysis. The compounds are simple to use and derivatisation is based on widely applied alkylating procedures. Preliminary results show that these reagents can be applied for both protein quantitation and identification by peptide mass finger printing and/or MS/MS techniques. Using these chemicals and the suggested workflow enables the quantitative analysis of the whole protein sample and realises access to peptides that may contain potential post-translational modifications. Other approaches that incorporate a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI) interface prior to MS {{can take advantage of}} these chemicals, such as the <b>molecular</b> <b>scanner...</b>|$|E

STIR (Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction [1]), an open source C++ library, {{has been used as a}} basis for this platform. However, a number of practical issues have to be addressed before useful reconstructed images can be obtained. Many of the practical issues have been addressed and reconstructions of two datasets (phantom and human brain) are demonstrated.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{is to provide a}} {{software}} solution which would enable very fast list-mode data processing offered by the massively parallel graphics processor units (GPU) while dealing efficiently with the common bottleneck of data transfers between hard disk storage, host (CPU) memory and device (GPU) memory. This software is dedicated to the PETLINK™ list-mode data format which is used by the Siemens’ hybrid Biograph <b>Molecular</b> MR (mMR) <b>scanner.</b> This software is developed as part of our platform for mMR 3 D and 4 D PET image reconstruction and will be freely accessible to the community. The aim is to perform real time processing (i.e. without perceivable delay) of the list-mode data during data transfers from hard disk to the CPU memory. The output of the processing includes: (1) The count-rate data (head curve: prompts, randoms and singles per second). (2) Plot of the variation of the centre of mass due to kinetics and motion (crude motion detection and quantification). (3) Projection movies (sagittal and coronal) for visual inspection for motion and data quality. (4) Crystal fan-sums for any time frame (used for randoms noise reduction). (5) Singles rate for each detector bucket (used for dead-time correction during normalisation). (6) Static and dynamic sinograms of span- 1 and span- 11. This workflow enables list-mode data processing synchronously with data transfer from disk to CPU memory. It opens a way for fast creation of multiple bootstrap realisations and multiple image reconstructions for a single dataset providing valuable insight into distributions of any statistic used in the development of robust image bio-markers. Also, the proposed workflow is advantageous for list-mode image reconstruction.|$|R
30|$|U 87 ΔEGFR cells {{treated with}} cilengitide (1.0  μM for 16  h) and {{untreated}} control U 87 ΔEGFR cells {{were analyzed using}} a CodeLink™ Human Whole Genome Bioarray (Applied Microarrays, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA). We entrusted the microarray analyses to Filgen, Inc. (Nagoya, Japan). Briefly, for each bioarray, 10  μg of cRNA in a 25 μL total volume were added to 5 μL of 5 × fragmentation buffer, which was then incubated at 94 °C for 20  min. Thereafter, 10  μg of fragmented cRNA, 78 μL of hybridization buffer component A, and 130 μL of hybridization buffer component B were added, and the final volume was brought up to 260 μL with water. The resultant hybridization reaction mixture was incubated at 90 °C for 5  min, after which 250 μL were slowly injected into the input port of each array, and the ports were sealed with sealing strips. The bioarrays were then incubated for 18  h at 37 °C while shaking at 300  rpm. A consistent hybridization time was maintained for comparative experiments. Following the incubation, the bioarrays were washed with 0.75 TNT buffer (0.10  M Tris–HCl, pH  7.6, 0.15  M NaCl, 0.05 % Tween 20) and incubated at 46 °C for 1  h. Each slot of the small reagent reservoir was then filled with 3.4  mL of Cy 5 -Streptavidin working solution, and the array was incubated at 25 °C for another 30  min. Thereafter, the bioarrays were washed 4 times for 5  min each with 1 [*]×[*]TNT buffer at 25 °C, rinsed twice in 0.1 × SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA)/ 0.05 % Tween 20 for 30  s each, and immediately dried by centrifugation for 3  min at 25 °C. Finally, the arrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000 B Array <b>Scanner</b> (<b>Molecular</b> Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). A gene was defined as being upregulated when the cilengitide treatment/control average intensity ratio was > 4.0, and downregulated when the cilengitide treatment/control ratio was < 0.25. We performed pathway analysis on the genes that expressed increase and decrease using Microarray Data Analysis Tool Ver 3.2 (Filgen, Inc).

40|$|Now, {{that mass}} {{spectrometry}} (MS) {{has been established}} as the analytical tool {{for the analysis of}} proteins a new challenge awaits: the development of spatial resolved mass spectrometry directly on biological tissue and cells at single cell level or beyond. The desire to study the complexity of biological systems and their diseased states requires high lateral resolution, molecule specific imaging tools capable of visualizing the distributions {{of a wide range of}} known and unknown molecules in biological samples (cells / tissue). Especially, the identity, distributions and modifications of proteins are of great interest since they can serve as biomarkers for specific diseases. In contrast to other molecular imaging techniques, imaging mass spectrometry combines lateral resolving power with mass spectrometry's chemical specificity. The combination of these characteristics makes imaging mass spectrometry especially attractive for application as research tool in the areas of cell biochemistry, biomarker discovery and drug development and potentially as diagnostic tool in medical sciences. We have implemented a stigmatic or microscope mode ion imaging methodology for UV-MALDI MS to improve lateral resolution and speed of operation. For this purpose a time-of-flight mass spectrometer with stigmatic ion optics was equipped with an UV- MALDI source. In contrast to the conventional scanning microprobe MALDI imaging methodology the microscope mode approach uses spatial resolved ion detection instead of spatial resolved ion generation to record the distributions of biomolecules. The resulting apparatus is capable of projecting magnified ion-optical images of distributions of macromolecules from within the illuminated area (200 ìm in diameter) onto a detector. It is shown that these ion images can be recorded with 4 ìm lateral resolution. One cycle of the experiment is completed within 1 ms; in this time ion images across the entire mass range are created. In comparison with the conventional scanning microprobe methodology the microscope mode imaging MS offers a reduction in acquisition time of three orders of magnitude. The microscopic nature of the presented technique removes the demand for a highly focused laser spot to achieve high spatial resolution. This offers a greater versatility in choice of ionization sources for high resolution macromolecular imaging MS. This is demonstrated in experiments in which a 2. 94 ìm IR laser was used for ionization purposes (IR-MALDI). The spatial resolution that was achieved in these experiments was equal to the resolution obtained for UV-MALDI microscope mode imaging. To improve protein identification possibilities and feasible mass range in microscope mode imaging MS it is combined with the <b>molecular</b> <b>scanner</b> methodology. This protein identification technique uses one-step-digestion-transfer and peptide mass fingerprinting to rapidly identify proteins from complex mixtures. It is shown that in this manner high mass proteins (> 100, 000 Da) can be detected and identified. Another ionization technique, which is frequently used in imaging MS, is secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). It is capable of submicron spatial resolution but the chemical information that is obtained is limited: in the energetic SIMS ion formation process nearly all molecular species are extensively fragmented. Multiple sample preparation protocols have been developed to improve the intact molecular ion yield in SIMS. One of these is termed: matrix-enhanced SIMS (ME-SIMS). We have studied the effects of matrix application in imaging MS studies and shown that one of the factors that improves the molecular ionization yields in ME-SIMS is reduction of the internal energy of the molecular ions created in the ionization process...|$|E
