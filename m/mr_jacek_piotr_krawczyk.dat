Together with Tomasz Czubak, <b>Jacek</b> Bocian and <b>Piotr</b> Haczek he {{won the gold medal}} in 4 x 400 metres relay at the 1999 World Championships in Athletics. Maćkowiak has also won other relay medals as well as {{individual}} medals in the 200 metres and 400 metres.|$|R
50|$|We cut to Jacek in court, {{having just}} {{been convicted of}} robbery and murder. <b>Jacek's</b> lawyer is <b>Piotr,</b> in his first case after {{finishing}} law school. Piotr, who earlier argued the immorality of the death penalty, is distressed at having failed to save his client from a death sentence, and enters the judge's chambers to ask if a more experienced or articulate lawyer might have succeeded.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{execution}} Jacek asks to speak {{one last time}} to Piotr, who we learn is a new father. <b>Piotr</b> tells <b>Jacek</b> {{that it was not}} he but his deed that was condemned; Jacek sees no distinction. Jacek reveals that five years earlier his beloved 12-year-old sister was killed by a drunk driver who had been drinking vodka with his friend—Jacek. Jacek wonders if he would have lived a better life if his sister hadn't died. He asks to be buried alongside his sister and father, although there is only one remaining burial spot which his mother would have to agree to relinquish. <b>Jacek</b> asks <b>Piotr</b> to give the enlarged photo of the girl to his mother.|$|R
50|$|In {{that season}} Wisłoka {{played in the}} Eastern group of the 2nd National Division, placing on the 12th position. The future {{opponent}} of Dębica's side in the Cup of Poland, Ruch Chorzów, was one of top Polish teams, placing in the fourth location in the First Division (behind Lech Poznań, Legia Warszawa and ŁKS Łódź). Officially, it was the reserve team that represented Ruch in this Cup season, {{but according to the}} rules first team players were allowed to take part and so they did. Among others, the following players represented Ruch: Radosław Gilewicz, Waldemar Fornalik, Mariusz Srutwa, Dariusz Gęsior, <b>Jacek</b> Bednarz, <b>Piotr</b> Mosor. On 12 August 1992, Wisłoka won 4-2 an away game vs Sandecja Nowy Sącz. On 26 August 1992, Wisłoka won another away game (3-0 vs. Stal II Mielec). On 20 October 1992 Wisłoka beat at home Hutnik Kraków 2-1. On 10 November 1992, Wisłoka headed to the town of Police, beating 3-2 Chemik Police. Finally, in the quarterfinals of the Cup of Poland (10 and 23 March 1993), Wisłoka twice lost to Ruch II Chorzów (0-1 at home, and 0-2 away). Nevertheless, the quarterfinals against Ruch were the biggest success in the history of Wisłoka's soccer team.|$|R
50|$|On the {{appointed}} day, the executioner {{arrives at the}} jail and prepares for the hanging. Piotr is at the prison to attend the execution, and an official congratulates him on having just become a father. In the moments before his execution, <b>Jacek</b> reveals to <b>Piotr</b> that his baby sister {{was killed by a}} tractor driven by his drunken friend, and that he was drinking with him; he says he never fully recovered from the tragic episode. Jacek then requests that he be given the final space in his family's grave which was reserved for his mother—that he be buried next to his sister and his father. The warden repeatedly asks if they are finished talking; Piotr defiantly says he will never be finished. Jacek makes some petty last requests to his lawyer. They conclude things would've turned out differently if the girl had not tragically died.|$|R

PCK” Hospital in Gdynia, 5 Department of Molecular Spectroscopy, Institute of Experimental Physics, University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland Abstract: There is no fully {{effective}} treatment for secondary lymphedema. In patients with breast cancer, lymphedema may present immediately after axillary dissection or years later. It typically {{occurs in a}} limb (such as an arm), {{but it can also}} occur in the torso, especially in breast cancer patients. It is, therefore, essential to prevent or minimize the condition. The currently used compression therapy has varying efficiency. Thus, researchers are still looking for better solutions, especially for primary prevention. The aim {{of this study was to}} find whether compression corsets therapy with a class I compression garment could prevent truncal lymphedema on the operated side in females who underwent mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection as the standard of care for breast cancer treatment without subsequent reconstruction. We also investigated whether this therapy is efficient in prevention and treatment of truncal lymphedema in patients who underwent mastectomy and additional radiotherapy, and finally whether this method could be implemented for pain reduction strategies in this treatment group. The study was carried out in 50 randomly selected breast cancer patients classified by the oncologist as candidates for surgery. The final study was completed in 37 patients who underwent mastectomy and lymphadenectomy. The study group was randomly divided into two subgroups: subgroup G (received compression corsets 1 month following the surgery) and subgroup K (control) in which the patients underwent no physiotherapeutic treatment. The size of truncal lymphedema was measured using ultrasound in presentation B. Measurements were carried out symmetrically on both sides of the chest wall. The patients were examined four times. The follow-up was for 7 months in total. After the second measurement, a randomly selected subgroup of patients received properly fitted compression corsets, which they had to wear throughout the study, whereas the control subgroup had no physiotherapy treatment. The results were statistically analyzed. In both subgroups, we analyzed the reduction of pain using a visual analog scale. The results strongly suggest that when properly fitted, class I compression corsets not only are an {{effective treatment}} for lymphedema but also could be used for antiedematous prevention in patients who underwent removal of axillary lymph nodes as well as radiotherapy. Results of these studies have also confirmed that the use of compression corsets could reduce pain associated with surgical treatment of breast cancer.
