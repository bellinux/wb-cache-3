6000|$|The {{immediate}} goal {{of every}} gondolier's ambition is to serve, no matter for how short a time, an Inglese, by which generic title nearly all foreigners except Germans {{are known to}} him. The Inglese, whether he be English or American, is apt to make the tour of the whole city in a gondola, and to give handsome drink money at the end, whereas your Tedesco frugally walks to every place accessible by land, or when, in a party of six or eight, he takes a gondola, plants himself upon {{the letter of the}} tariff, and will give no more than the rate fixed by law. The gondolier is therefore flowingly polite to the Inglese, and he is even civil to the Tedesco; but he is not at all bound in courtesy to that provincial Italian who comes from the country to Venice, bargains furiously for his boat, and commonly pays under the tariff. The Venetian who does not himself keep a gondola seldom hires one, and even on this rare occasion makes no lavish demand such as [...] "How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> for taking me to the rail-way station?" [...] Lest the fervid imagination of the gondolier rise to zwanzigers and florins, and a tedious dispute ensue, he asks: [...] "How many centissimi do you want?" [...] and the contract is made, for a number of soldi.|$|E
60|$|The thing happened, say five-and-twenty years ago. I was {{a modest}} young uncommercial then, and timid and inexperienced. Many suns and winds have browned {{me in the}} line, but those were my pale days. Having newly taken the lease of {{a house in a}} certain {{distinguished}} metropolitan parish--a house which then appeared {{to me to be a}} frightfully first-class Family Mansion, involving awful responsibilities--I became the prey of a Beadle. I think the Beadle must have seen me going in or coming out, and must have observed that I tottered under the weight of my grandeur. Or he may have been in hiding under straw when I bought my first horse (in the desirable stable-yard attached to the first-class Family Mansion), and when the vendor remarked to me, in an original manner, on bringing him for approval, taking his cloth off and smacking him, 'There, Sir! THERE'S a Orse!' And when I said gallantly, 'How <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> for him?' and when the vendor said, 'No more than sixty guineas, from you,' and when I said smartly, 'Why not more than sixty from ME?' And when he said crushingly, 'Because upon my soul and body he'd be considered cheap at seventy, by one who understood the subject--but you don't.'--I say, the Beadle may have been in hiding under straw, when this disgrace befell me, or he may have noted that I was too raw and young an Atlas to carry the first-class Family Mansion in a knowing manner. Be this as it may, the Beadle did what Melancholy did to the youth in Gray's Elegy--he marked me for his own. And the way in which the Beadle did it, was this: he summoned me as a Juryman on his Coroner's Inquests.|$|E

50|$|The Head-on Collision is an {{intervention}} aimed not at any single defense but rather {{aimed at the}} entire defensive structure being deployed by the patient. It is an urgent appeal to the patient to exert maximal effort to overcome the resistance, and it {{takes the form of}} a summary statement to the patient which explains the consequences of continuing to resist:Let's take a look at what's happening here. You have come on your own free will, because you are experiencing a problem which causes you pain. We have set out to get to the root of your difficulties, but every time we attempt to move toward it, you put up this massive wall. The wall keeps me out, and it keeps you from knowing your own true feelings. If you keep me out, you keep me useless. Is that what <b>you</b> <b>want?</b> Because, as <b>you</b> see, you are certainly capable of keeping me useless to you. My first question is, why would <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me to be useless? You see, the consequences of this would be that I would be unable to help you. I'd like to, but the nature of this work is that I can't help everyone. Sometimes I fail. However, can you afford to fail? How <b>much</b> longer <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to carry this burden?This complex intervention is simultaneously aimed at the patient's will, is a reminder of the task, and is a wake-up call to the therapeutic alliance to exert maximal effort against the resistance. It is a reminder, in stark terms, that the therapeutic task is in jeopardy and may well fail. Finally, it is a reminder to the patient of the consequences of failure, as well as an implied reminder that success is also possible.|$|R
5000|$|According to Stewart, at {{the time}} of {{recording}} The Original Soundtrack the band was already being courted by Mercury Records (part of the Phonogram group) to leave Jonathan King's small UK Records label, where they were struggling financially. He said: [...] "I rang them. I said come and have a listen to what we've done, come and have a listen to this track. And they came up and they freaked, and they said, 'This is a masterpiece. How <b>much</b> money, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want?</b> What sort of a contract <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want?</b> We'll <b>do</b> anything.' On the strength of that one song, we did a five-year deal with them for five albums and they paid us a serious amount of money." [...] Despite impressing their new label with the track, Phonogram felt that it was not suitable for release as a single due to its length, and released [...] "Life Is a Minestrone" [...] as the first single from The Original Soundtrack instead. However, many influential figures in the music industry were demanding that [...] "I'm Not in Love" [...] be released as a single, and Mercury eventually bowed to the pressure and released it as the second single from the album. The band were forced to edit the track down to four minutes for radio play, but once it charted, pressure from the public and the media caused the radio stations to revert to playing the full version.|$|R
