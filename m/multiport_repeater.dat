50|$|An Ethernet hub, active hub, network hub, {{repeater}} hub, <b>multiport</b> <b>repeater,</b> {{or simply}} hub is a network hardware device for connecting multiple Ethernet devices together {{and making them}} act as a single network segment. It has multiple input/output (I/O) ports, in which a signal introduced at the input of any port appears at the output of every port except the original incoming. A hub works at the physical layer (layer 1) of the OSI model. A repeater hub also participates in collision detection, forwarding a jam signal to all ports if it detects a collision. In addition to standard 8P8C ("RJ45") ports, some hubs may also come with a BNC or an Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) connector to allow connection to legacy 10BASE2 or 10BASE5 network segments.|$|E
50|$|A {{network hub}} is an unsophisticated device in {{comparison}} with a switch. As a <b>multiport</b> <b>repeater</b> it works by repeating bits (symbols) received from one of its ports to all other ports. It is aware of physical layer packets, that is it can detect their start (preamble), an idle line (interpacket gap) and sense a collision which it also propagates by sending a jam signal. A hub cannot further examine or manage any of the traffic that comes through it: any packet entering any port is rebroadcast on all other ports. A hub/repeater has no memory to store any data in - a packet must be transmitted while it is received or is lost when a collision occurs (the sender should detect this and retry the transmission). Due to this, hubs can only run in half duplex mode. Consequently, due to a larger collision domain, packet collisions are more frequent in networks connected using hubs than in networks connected using more sophisticated devices.|$|E
40|$|Many {{researchers}} in the Division have projects which require transferring large files between their personal computers (PC) and VAX computers in the Laboratory for Oceans Computing Facility (LOCF). Since Ethernet local area network provides high speed communication channels which make file transfers (among other capabilities) practical, a network plan was assembled to connect IBM and IBM compatible PC's to Ethernet for participating personnel. The design employs ThinWire Ethernet technology. A simplified configuration diagram is shown. A DEC <b>multiport</b> <b>repeater</b> (DEMPR) is used for connection of ThinWire Ethernet segments. One port of DEMPR is connected to a H 4000 transceiver and the transceiver is clamped onto the Goddard Ethernet backbonecoaxial cable so that the PC's can be optionally on the SPAN network. All these common elements were successfully installed and tested...|$|E
50|$|These changes {{mean that}} RMII uses {{about half the}} number of signals {{compared}} to MII. The high pin count of MII {{is more of a}} burden on microcontrollers with built-in MAC, FPGAs, <b>multiport</b> switches or <b>repeaters,</b> and PC motherboard chipsets than it is for a separate single-port Ethernet MAC, which partially explains why the older MII standard was more wasteful of pins.|$|R
