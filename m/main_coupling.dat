40|$|The PFC Boost Converter is an {{integral}} part of modern power supplies to improve power factor in electronic devices. The inherent problem associated with it is common mode (CM) Electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise arising due to the higher switching transition rate (dv/dt). The <b>main</b> <b>coupling</b> path for the CM noise is provided by parasitic capacitance occurring between the switching node and ground. In this scenario, it is important to identify feasible solutions for CM noise reduction. This paper therefore develops a circuit model for a boost PFC converter allowing detailed analyses of the performance of this type of converter. It includes all parasitic components along the CM noise path. Using this CM noise model, a novel balancing approach is proposed that mitigates CM noise in a PFC boost converter. Validation of the new design approach is supported by experimental results demonstrating substantial noise reduction for a balanced PFC boost converter...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} a liquid mixture in the {{thermodynamically}} stable homogeneous phase can undergo a phase-separation transition when rotated at sufficiently high frequency ω. This phase-transition {{is different from the}} usual case where two liquids are immiscible or where the slow sedimentation process of one component (e. g. a polymer) is accelerated due to centrifugation. For a binary mixture, the <b>main</b> <b>coupling</b> is due to a term ∝Δρ(ω r) ^ 2, where Δρ is {{the difference between the two}} liquid densities and r the distance from the rotation axis. Below the critical temperature there is a critical rotation frequency ω_c, below which smooth density gradients occur. When ω>ω_c, we find a sharp interface between the low density liquid close to the center of the centrifuge and a high density liquid far from the center. These findings may be relevant to various separation processes and to the control of chemical reactions, in particular their kinetics. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|A two-layer {{robust control}} scheme is {{proposed}} {{to get a}} better response ability for emergency maneuvers of helicopter.

A conclusion in global asymptotically tracking for devising this new scheme is firstly derived from a Generalized Gronwall-Bellman approach. Due to this integrated designing, not only is the helicopter better controlled, but also much better power rapid tracking is realized for engines. Simulations are conducted to validate the new scheme in emergent ascending and descending flights, and the results illustrate that the response time of the closed-loop system is dramatically reduced when compared to the traditional one. Moreover, the presented system also has better dynamic performance under inferences. Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & PropulsionAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{experiments}} where we shear granular rods in split-bottom geometries, {{and find that}} a significant heap of height of least 40 % of the filling height can form at the particle surface. We show that heaping {{is caused by a}} significant secondary flow, absent for spherical particles. Flow reversal transiently reverses the secondary flow, leading to a quick collapse and slower regeneration of the heap. We present a symmetry argument and experimental data that show that the generation of the secondary flow is driven by a misalignment of the mean particle orientation with the streamlines of the flow. For spherical granular media, the <b>main</b> <b>coupling</b> between micro structure and macroscopic mechanics, such as the re-sistance to flow, is through the local packing density 1.

40|$|In gravitational-wave interferometers, test masses are {{suspended}} on thin fibers which experience considerable tension stress. Sudden microscopic stress release in a suspension fiber, which I call a 'creep event', would excite {{motion of the}} test mass that would be coupled to the interferometer's readout. The random test-mass motion due to a time-sequence of creep events {{is referred to as}} 'creep noise'. In this paper I present an elasto-dynamic calculation for the test-mass motion due to a creep event. I show that within a simple suspension model, the <b>main</b> <b>coupling</b> to the optical readout occurs via a combination of a "dc" horizontal displacement of the test mass, and excitation of the violin and pendulum modes, and not, as was thought previously, via lengthening of the fiber. When the creep events occur sufficiently frequently and their statistics is time-independent, the creep noise can be well-approximated by a stationary Gaussian random process. I derive the functional form of the creep noise spectral density in this limit, with the restrictive assumption that the creep events are statistically independent from each other.
