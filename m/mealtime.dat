40|$|While lasting {{only twenty}} minutes, on average, family <b>mealtimes</b> are {{embedded}} in a social, cultural, and economic context {{that are associated with}} a variety of indicators of children’s health and wellbeing.

To aid this {{important}} group in their food and meal requirements, a deeper insight into the expectations and experiences of these persons regarding their <b>mealtimes</b> and snack times is needed. In the current study, we aim to identify consumer segments within {{the group of}} vital community-dwelling older persons {{on the basis of}} the emotions they associate with their <b>mealtimes</b> and snack times (from now on referred to as <b>mealtimes).</b> Participants (n¿=¿ 392, mean age 65. 8 (years) ¿±¿ 5. 9 (SD)) completed an online survey. The survey consisted of three questionnaires: emotions associated with <b>mealtimes,</b> functionality of <b>mealtimes,</b> and psychographic characteristics (health and taste attitudes, food fussiness, and food neophobia). Consumer segments were identified and characterised based on the emotions that the respondents reported to experience at <b>mealtimes,</b> using a hierarchical cluster analysis. Clusters were described using variables previously not included in the cluster analysis, such as functionality of <b>mealtimes</b> and psychographic characteristics. Four consumer segments were identified: Pleasurable averages, Adventurous arousals, Convivial indulgers, and Indifferent restrictives. These segments differed significantly in their emotional associations with <b>mealtimes</b> both in valence and level of arousal. The present study provides actionable insights for the development of products and communication strategies tailored to the needs of vital community-dwelling older persons...|$|R

25|$|Several analogs {{of human}} insulin are available. These insulin analogs {{are closely related}} to the human insulin structure, and were {{developed}} for specific aspects of glycemic control in terms of fast action (prandial insulins) and long action (basal insulins). The first biosynthetic insulin analog was developed for clinical use at <b>mealtime</b> (prandial insulin), Humalog (insulin lispro), it is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than regular insulin, with an effect 15minutes after injection. Other rapid-acting analogues are NovoRapid and Apidra, with similar profiles. All are rapidly absorbed due to amino acid sequences that will reduce formation of dimers and hexamers (monomeric insulins are more rapidly absorbed). Fast acting insulins do not require the injection-to-meal interval previously recommended for human insulin and animal insulins. The other type is long acting insulin; the first of these was Lantus (insulin glargine). These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24hours. Likewise, another protracted insulin analogue (Levemir) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach. A myristyric acid molecule is attached to this analogue, which associates the insulin molecule to the abundant serum albumin, which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin. A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted insulin is also available, making it more likely for patients to achieve an insulin profile that mimics that of the body´s own insulin release.|$|E

High replies that daily, after they've dressed and put on their war gear, they go out to the courtyard and battle one another in one-on-one combat for sport. Then, when <b>mealtime</b> comes, they ride home to Valhalla and drink. High then quotes Vafþrúðnismál stanza 41.

[...] She describes the example of Greg sitting down for dinner with the Byrnes family and being asked to bless the food. In this scene, Greg attempts to recite a prayer by improvising and, in doing so, launches into a recital of the song [...] "Day by Day" [...] from Act I of Godspell. Bower notes this scene as [...] "particularly important for establishing the cultural distance" [...] between the Jewish Greg and the Christian Byrnes. She noted that the social gap is further widened next morning when Greg is the last person to arrive at the breakfast table; he shows up wearing pajamas while everyone else is fully clothed. Here Greg is shown eating a bagel, which Bower argues as being a clear signifier of Jewishness.|$|E

No records of dodos by these are known, although the Portuguese name for Mauritius, [...] "Cerne (swan) Island", {{may have been a}} reference to dodos. The Dutch Empire acquired Mauritius in 1598, renaming it after Maurice of Nassau, and it was used for the provisioning of trade vessels of the Dutch East India Company henceforward. The earliest known accounts of the dodo were provided by Dutch travelers during the Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia, led by admiral Jacob van Neck in 1598. They appear in reports published in 1601, which also contain the first published illustration of the bird. Since the first sailors to visit Mauritius had been at sea for a long time, their interest in these large birds was mainly culinary. The 1602 journal by Willem Van West-Zanen of the ship Bruin-Vis mentions that 24–25 dodos were hunted for food, which were so large that two could scarcely be consumed at <b>mealtime,</b> their remains being preserved by salting.

40|$|<b>Mealtimes</b> are {{opportunities}} for social interactions and expressions {{of individual and}} family identity, {{and serve as a}} microcosm of the broader lives of families living with dementia. The Eating Together study and its resulting Life Nourishment Theory (LNT) explicated the importance of <b>mealtimes</b> for honouring individual and family identities in the context of dementia. This sub-study examined a specific ethnocultural group with cultural food-ways and caring expectations, to determine if the concept of honouring identity needed to be modified or extended. Using active interview techniques, two Cantonese speaking researchers completed dyad/triad family and individual interviews with six Chinese Canadian immigrant families, recruited from two service providers in a large, urban, multicultural city. This sub-study provided insight into the challenges and rewards of <b>mealtimes</b> for Chinese immigrant families with dementia in the community and specifically provided further insights into the honouring identity concept. Although LNT and specifically the honouring identity concept was generally confirmed in this group, some culturally-specific themes were also identified. This work serves as a basis for future studies examining the meaning and experience of <b>mealtimes</b> in specific cultural groups living with dementia. Such work would confirm if the LNT can be applied to specific ethnocultural groups as well as the general population living with dementia...|$|R
