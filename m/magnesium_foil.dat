50|$|Electrochemical {{batteries}} can {{be modified}} to integrate the use of paper. An electrochemical battery typically uses two metals, separated into two chambers and connected by a bridge or a membrane which permits the exchange of electrons between the two metals, thereby producing energy. Paper can be integrated into electrochemical batteries by depositing the electrode onto the paper and by using paper to contain the fluid used to activate the battery. Paper that has been patterned {{can also be used}} in electrochemical batteries. This is done to make the battery more compatible with paper electronics. These batteries tend to produce low voltage and operate for short periods of time, but they can be connected in series to increase their output and capacity. Paper batteries of this type can be activated with bodily fluids which makes them very useful in the healthcare field such as single-use medical devices or tests for specific diseases.A battery of this type has been developed with a longer life to power point of care devices for the healthcare industry. The device used a paper battery made using a <b>magnesium</b> <b>foil</b> anode and a silver cathode has been used to detect diseases in patients such as kidney cancer, liver cancer, and osteoblastic bone cancer. The paper was patterned using wax printing and is able to be easily disposed of. Furthermore, this battery was developed at a low cost and has other practical application.|$|E
50|$|The other {{hydrogen}} chalcogenides {{are highly}} toxic, malodorous gases. Hydrogen sulfide occurs commonly {{in nature and}} its properties compared with water reveal a lack of any significant hydrogen bonding. Since they are both gases at STP, hydrogen can be simply burned {{in the presence of}} oxygen to form water in a highly exothermic reaction; such a test can be used in beginner chemistry to test for the gases produced by a reaction as hydrogen will burn with a pop. Water, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen selenide may be made by heating their constituent elements together above 350 °C, but hydrogen telluride and polonium hydride are not attainable by this method due to their thermal instability; hydrogen telluride decomposes in moisture, in light, and in temperatures above 0 °C. Polonium hydride is unstable, and due to the intense radioactivity of polonium (resulting in self-radiolysis upon formation), only trace quantities may be obtained by treating dilute hydrochloric acid with polonium-plated <b>magnesium</b> <b>foil.</b> Its properties are somewhat distinct {{from the rest of the}} hydrogen chalcogenides, since polonium is a metal while the other chalcogens are not, and hence this compound is intermediate between a normal hydrogen chalcogenide or hydrogen halide such as hydrogen chloride, and a metal hydride like stannane. Like water, the first of the group, polonium hydride is also a liquid at room temperature. Unlike water, however, the strong intermolecular attractions that cause the higher boiling point are van der Waals interactions, an effect of the large electron clouds of polonium.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method for}} the {{corrosion}} inhibition of Mg, alloys, {{based on the}} formation of a thin polyacrylic-polypyrrole film, is presented. The film was created after simple immersion of the samples in a specially formulated emulsion of polyacrylic and polypyrrole polymers. The synthesis conditions were studied, as well as the resulting corrosion resistance of coated <b>magnesium</b> <b>foils</b> (AZ 31) in terms of corrosion rate in neutral aqueous NaCl solutions. The relative ratio of polyacrylic polymer to polypyrrole was found to be important for the film properties. Furthermore, only in situ polymerisation of pyrrole in the polyacrylic emulsion can provide advanced corrosion proper-ties in relatively thin films (2 - 5 mum). Blending of polypyrrole powder with the polyacrylic emulsion gives rise to thick films (20 mum) with reduced corrosion-inhibition properties. The corrosion rate was only weakly dependent on the film thickness of these novel coatings. We argue that the mechanism of corrosion inhibition is related to {{the formation of a}} thin passive layer of chemisorbed polypyrrole polymers or oligomers on the native magnesium oxide of the C surface. The structure is further stabilised by polyacrylic polymer chains interacting as dopants of polypyrrole. The method is environmentally friendly: non-toxic chemicals are used, no rinsing is required, etc. The advanced corrosion-inhibition properties of the films. as well as the simple application process on the metal surface, provide significant potential for the industrial application of the method.

40|$|Prototype {{cells of}} hybrid {{capacitor}} were developed, comprising activated carbon (AC) cloth and <b>magnesium</b> (Mg) <b>foil</b> as {{the positive and}} negative electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte solution included ether solvent (THF) and a magnesium organo-halo-aluminate complex 0. 25 M Mg 2 Cl 3 +-Ph 2 AlCl 2 −. In this solution Mg can be deposited/dissolved reversibly for thousands of cycles with high reversibility (100 % cycling efficiency). The main barrier for integrating porous AC electrodes with this electrolyte solution was the saturation of the pores with the large ions in the AC prior to reaching the potential limit. This is due to the existence of bulky Mg and Al based ionic complexes consisting Cl, alkyl or aryl (R), and THF ligands. This problem was resolved by adding 0. 5 M of lithium chloride (LiCl), thus introducing smaller ionic species to the solution. This Mg hybrid capacitor system demonstrated a stable cycle performance for many thousands of cycles with a specific capacitance of 90 F g− 1 for the AC positive electrodes along a potential range of 2. 4 V...|$|R
40|$|Solid-state thermoelectrics that convert {{thermal energy}} into {{electricity}} {{have the potential}} to increase the efficiencies of existing process and systems (e. g., automobiles). The large-scale deployment of thermoelectrics for terrestrial use requires the following: a) enhancing their efficiencies beyond that are currently possible, and b) their fabrication from non-toxic, inexpensive, earth-abundant elements. Recent studies have determined that nanostructuring of earth-abundant materials, such as magnesium silicide (Mg 2 Si), is a possible pathway for accomplishing this task. Contextually, the overall aim of this dissertation is to engineer highly efficient Mg 2 Si nanowire-based thermoelectrics. This was achieved through the design of strategies for (1) the large-scale synthesis of a form of nanostructured Mg 2 Si, nanowires of Mg 2 Si, and (2) the interface-engineered assembly of the synthesized nanowires into welded nanowire networks that do not have any insulating MgO at the nanowire interfaces. Together, these strategies are intended to offer the ability to control thermal and electrical transport through Mg 2 Si. For the large-scale synthesis of Mg 2 Si nanowires, a phase transformation strategy that converts pre-synthesized silicon nanowires into Mg 2 Si nanowires was engineered. Experimentation performed indicated that 20 to 300 nm-thick, 5 to 20 ?m-long silicon nanowires obtained by electroless etching can be phase transformed into polycrystalline Mg 2 Si nanowires by reacting them with magnesium supplied via the vapor phase. To prevent the formation of multiple nuclei within each silicon nanowire during the phase transformation process and the formation of polycrystalline Mg 2 Si nanowires, a solid-state phase transformation process was engineered. Here, the solid-state reaction of sharp-tipped silicon nanowires with <b>magnesium</b> <b>foils</b> was employed for obtaining single-crystalline Mg 2 Si nanowires. To assemble the nanowires, the solid-state phase transformation strategy was extended and the phase transformation of silica nanoparticle coated silicon nanowires was employed. This procedure {{led to the formation of}} welded Mg 2 Si nanowire networks, where both the nanowires and the bridges connecting the nanowires were composed of Mg 2 Si. Thermoelectric performance evaluation of these networks and microcrystalline Mg 2 Si devices proved our hypothesis and indicated a 2 -fold increase in the power factors. The high power factor of 0. 972 x 10 ^- 3 Wm^- 1 K^- 2 achieved at 875 K is twice that reported in the literature for undoped Mg 2 Si...|$|R

40|$|A {{procedure}} for {{the measurement of}} material damping is described. The free decay of free-free beams, when lofted into free fall in vacuum, was recorded. Tests were performed on aluminum, graphite/epoxy, and graphite/magnesium metal matrix materials. Specimens with a fundamental free-free frequency below the elaxation frequency showed {{a higher level of}} damping and of stress dependence than predicted. For 0 sub 8 laminates, a material damping ratio of 0. 00055 was found for fequencies varying from 45 Hz to 237 Hz. The damping was neither stress nor frequency dependent. For 90 sub 8 laminates, the damping ratio ranged from 0. 0055 to 0. 0066 as frequency ranged from 42 Hz to 143 Hz. Damping ratios for 90 sub 8 specimens were independent of stress. Experimentally measured damping ratios for metal matrix specimens with unidirectional graphite fibers, magnesium matrix, and either titanium or <b>magnesium</b> <b>foil,</b> ranged from. 00039 to. 00099, depending upon the matrix material, frequency, and possibly the stress range involved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For the {{measurement}} of induced activity in the activation foils, various methods and instruments are used. When the activity is measured by using a beta counter {{it is very important}} to know the beta attenuation in the activation foils. The beta attenuation in the foil depends on the beta spectrum of the activation product, the material and the thickness of the material. The beta attenuation has been evaluated theoretically as well as experimentally. The detailed investigations of beta attenuation in the foils are presented in this paper. The experimental study was conducted using an absolute system, the 4 πβ-γ coincidence system. For the various foils like Au, Mn, Co, Al and Mg used in this study, it is found that both theoretical and experimental values for the beta attenuation are matching. The attenuation of betas in the foils varies with beta energy spectrum and the materials and it varies from 7 % to 92 %. The foil activation method is very accurate for the neutron fluence rate measurement. In foil activation method the induced activity is correlated to the neutron fluence rate. This activity is measured using different counters. 4 πβ-ϒ coincidence system is the primary standard for the activity measurement. If the activity is very low this system cannot be used for {{the measurement}}. 4 πβ flow type proportional counters are used for {{the measurement of}} activity. For this the efficiency of the foil should be known accurately. Evaluation of the beta efficiency of different activation foils is discussed in this paper. Gold, Manganese and Cobalt foils are used for thermal neutrons and <b>Magnesium</b> and Aluminium <b>foils</b> are used for fast neutron measurements...|$|R
