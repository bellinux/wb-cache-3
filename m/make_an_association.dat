For Ludovico il Moro, the ermine had a further personal significance in {{that he had been}} in the Order of the Ermine (Naples) in 1488 and used it as a personal emblem. The association of the ermine with Cecilia Gallerani could have been intended to refer both to her purity and to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>association</b> with her lover. Alternatively, the ermine could be a pun on her name because the Ancient Greek term for ermine, or other weasel-like species of animals, is galê (γαλῆ) or galéē (γαλέη). This would be in keeping with Leonardo's placement of a juniper bush behind the figure in his portrait of Ginevra de Benci in reference to her name. Given that Gallerani gave birth to a son acknowledged by Lodovico in May 1491, and the association of weasels and pregnancy in Italian Renaissance culture, it also is possible the animal was a symbol of Cecilia's pregnancy. In addition, it has been speculated that the animal in the painting appears not to be an ermine, but a white ferret, a colour favoured in the Middle Ages because of the ease of seeing the white animal in thick undergrowth.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{interpretations of the}} {{significance}} of the ermine in her portrait. The ermine, a stoat in its winter coat, was a traditional symbol of purity because it was believed an ermine would face death rather than soil its white coat. In his old age, Leonardo compiled a bestiary in which he recorded:MODERATION The ermine out of moderation never eats but once a day, and it would rather let itself be captured by hunters than take refuge in a dirty lair, in order not to stain its purity.He repeats this idea in another note, [...] "Moderation curbs all the vices.
