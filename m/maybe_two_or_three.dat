500|$|After {{receiving}} the go-ahead {{to work on}} the project, Moore and Gibbons spent a day at the latter's house creating characters, crafting details for the story's milieu and discussing influences. The pair was particularly influenced by a Mad parody of Superman named [...] "Superduperman"; Moore said, [...] "We wanted to take Superduperman 180 degrees—dramatic, instead of comedic". Moore and Gibbons conceived of a story that would take [...] "familiar old-fashioned superheroes into a completely new realm"; the writer said his intention was to create [...] "a superhero Moby Dick; something that had that sort of weight, that sort of density". The writer came up with the character names and descriptions, but left the specifics of how they looked to Gibbons. Gibbons did not sit down and design the characters deliberately, but rather [...] "did it at odd times [...] spend <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> weeks just doing sketches." [...] Gibbons designed his characters to make them easy to draw; Rorschach was his favorite to draw because [...] "you just have to draw a hat. If you can draw a hat, then you've drawn Rorschach, you just draw kind of a shape for his face and put some black blobs on it and you're done." ...|$|E
500|$|Still needing {{only one}} victory to clinch the division, the Buccaneers {{lost to the}} San Francisco 49ers in O.J. Simpson's final home game. It was {{the second year in}} a row that the Buccaneers lost to a 49ers team that entered the game with a 1–13 record. The 49ers scored first, as Jeris White slipped while {{covering}} receiver Mike Shumann, leaving Shumann open for a 19-yard touchdown reception. The offense's single touchdown, a 19-yard pass from Doug Williams to Jimmie Giles, was a season low, while injuries to Mike Washington and Cedric Brown left the Buccaneers' secondary vulnerable. Mike Rae again saw duty at quarterback in the fourth quarter, with the game out of hand. Williams, who tearfully accepted blame for the loss, threw five interceptions that left McKay considering either benching him or avoiding pass plays. McKay also criticized the offensive line's blocking, saying that he [...] "saw (Ricky) Bell make some long runs, <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> inches". Under pressure of needing to win one game, the Buccaneers' tension ("state of shock", according to McKay) was noticeable to 49ers players. The loss dropped the Buccaneers into a 1st-place tie with the surging Chicago Bears in the NFC Central.|$|E

5000|$|Of the poem's main character, Maykov {{wrote in}} a letter to Pavel Viskovatov: [...] "Vladimir is so ambivalent: some of his views are pro-Russian, akin to those {{expressed}} by Moskvityanin, which I share myself, others smack of Belinsky-inspired Westernizing... He is a Pechorin-type hero, but of the University kind, and full of Belinsky's ideas." [...] Later Maykov changed both his political views and his opinion of the Two Fates. [...] "All of it, except <b>maybe</b> for <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> lyrical fragments, is phony; the play as such is exceptionally bad", he wrote.|$|R
5000|$|Williams is an ideas-driven author: {{the idea}} comes first. “Usually {{for me the}} trigger is an idea more than a {{character}} or a title. The Bobby Dollar book idea was ‘cold war,’ the Otherland idea was ‘river that links different virtual worlds together,’ the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn idea was ‘after a King-Arthur-type Great King dies.’ Then they sort of find their own characters and titles. (Well, I help.)” In an interview with Heiner Wittmann for Klett-Cotta, Williams explains, “Almost every book starts out as <b>maybe</b> one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> small ideas and then they kind of go into the mix and I wait. And if they last, if they survive for awhile, they begin to agglomerate with other ideas. They begin to become something {{more than the sum}} of its parts.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Producer Steve Hindalong is {{credited}} by the band as helping bring the project together. Taber says [...] "On this album, there was <b>maybe</b> only <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> fairly finished ideas {{before we started}} recording. The rest was 'Well we think we've got a verse, we think {{we might have a}} chorus, and we're not sure about the melody, we're not sure about the arrangement, we're not sure about any of the parts.' So Steve's influence helped us even be able to complete the songs and steer us in a certain direction....without Steve on this record, it wouldn't have been Mercury, it wouldn't have been the same record at all." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 21 June 2012, Smith {{spoke to}} Music Week about Glassheart being {{released}} on 26 November 2012. Scrapping {{many of the}} earlier recorded tracks (see recording sessions), Smith said he was [...] "taking a production role for the whole album as well as co-authoring about half its tracks". Lewis would later talk of the album's delay and Smith's involvement, describing the original release dates as rough guides. Following Lewis' performance at BBC Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, Smith revealed that the album was 80% complete, [...] "We've got the key tracks and we're very close." [...] Describing the process as {{a stark contrast to}} previous albums Spirit and Echo, Smith said that when you work with many producers [...] "you end up with <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> radio songs and not necessarily the album sales you want." [...] Lewis spoke to reporters back stage after the performance, revealing that the album had been brought forward a month to October 2012. By the time July had come around, Smith updated fans to say that the album was now 97% complete.|$|E
2500|$|Enya {{has yet to}} {{undertake}} a concert tour, despite hinting about the idea since the late 1980s and numerous requests from around the world. She claimed that Warner Music and herself [...] "did not see eye to eye" [...] initially as the label imagined her performing on stage [...] "with a piano ... <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> synthesiser players and that's it". Enya also explained that the time put into her studio albums cause her to [...] "run overtime", leaving little time to plan for other such projects. She also expressed the difficulty in recreating her studio-oriented sound for the stage. In 1996, Nicky Ryan said Enya received an offer worth almost £500,000 to perform a single concert in Japan. In 2016, Enya spoke {{about the prospect of}} a live concert when she revealed talks with the Ryans during her three-year break after And Winter Came... (2008) to perform a single show at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City that would be simulcast to cinemas worldwide. Before such an event could happen, Nicky suggested that she enters a studio and record [...] "all the hits" [...] live with an orchestra and choir to see how they would sound.|$|E

5000|$|Shines was 17 {{when he met}} Johnson in 1933. He {{estimated}} Johnson {{was maybe}} {{a year older than}} himself. Shines is quoted describing Johnson in Samuel Charters's Robert Johnson: Robert was a very friendly person, even though he was sulky at times, you know. And I hung around Robert for quite a while. One evening he disappeared. He was kind of a peculiar fellow. Robert'd be standing up playing some place, playing like nobody's business. At about that time it was a hustle with him as well as a pleasure. And money'd be coming from all directions. But Robert'd just pick up and walk off and leave you standing there playing. And you wouldn't see Robert no more <b>maybe</b> in <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> weeks. ... So Robert and I, we began journeying off. I was just, matter of fact, tagging along.|$|R

Then {{we came to the}} Black Rock, which rose five hundred feet above the trail. It {{was at the end of}} the day. Darkness was coming, and we could not find the cabin of McKeon. We slept hungry, and in the morning looked for the cabin. It was not there, which was a strange thing, for everybody knew that McKeon lived in a cabin at Black Rock. We were near to the coast, where the wind blows hard and there is much snow. Everywhere there were small hills of snow where the wind had piled it up. I have a thought, and I dig in one and another of the hills of snow. Soon I find the walls of the cabin, and I dig down to the door. I go inside. McKeon is dead. <b>Maybe</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> weeks he is dead. A sickness had come upon him so that he could not leave the cabin. The wind and the snow had covered the cabin. He had eaten his grub and died. I looked for his cache, but there was no grub in it.|$|E
2500|$|The 2002 {{marked a}} {{significant}} breakthrough for Kosgei in both track and road running. In May, {{he led the}} Kenyan team to victory at the 2002 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships {{with a time of}} 1:00:39. He edged out Jaouad Gharib to win the race on his first attempt at the half marathon distance. His first time success did not make him an immediate convert, however: [...] "I have changed my focus from the steeplechase to the 10,000 metres ... <b>Maybe</b> in <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years I will start to think about running the marathon". Kosgei became the Kenyan champion over 10,000m that summer, and his next test came at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England. He was entered into the 10,000m race and was second behind his Kenyan compatriot Wilberforce Talel – Kosgei's finishing time of 27:45.46 was seven hundredths of a second behind Talel, who broke the Games record for the event.|$|R
500|$|Air Force {{running back}} Leotis Palmer {{was having the}} best season of his career heading into the San Francisco Bowl. During the regular season, he {{accumulated}} 537rushing yards, four rushing touchdowns and 113passing yards for two touchdowns. Palmer and the Falcons had already clinched the season's rushing title, cementing their status as the No.1 rushing team in the country after West Virginia—the second-place team—failed to gain sufficient yardage in its final game to pass the Falcons. Despite finishing with the top-ranked rushing offense, none of Air Force's offensive linemen received postseason honors. [...] "It should give our players a lot of incentive for next year. Hopefully, if we repeat next year, <b>maybe</b> we'll get <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> on there.

Shortly prior to the recording sessions for Till Deaf Do Us Part, Holder and Lea further developed the song and the band then recorded it for inclusion on the album.

Me and Jim wrote it <b>maybe</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years ago. We tried to record it before but we never managed to get it down how we actually wanted it.

5000|$|Cantu's biggest {{cause was}} the miracle berry, which he {{believed}} could end hunger by {{allowing people to}} eat normally unpalatable food and end dependence on processed sugar.

I was out in my backyard one day, and I popped a miracle berry, and then I just started eating blades of grass ... And so, let's just stop and think about it: hyper-local cuisine would be just that: you walk out your door, and you don't look at it as weeds; it's now a new page in gastronomy. [...] On Future Food, Cantu demonstrated this idea by spending a week on a diet of miracle berries and common weeds, grass, and leaves he found in his backyard. [...] He would also regularly donate the berries to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy to make food more palatable to them.|$|E

As {{was the case with the}} nations in what is now England, Scotland and Wales, the more powerful of the kingdoms of Ireland all regarded themselves as fully independent entities, rather as Germany was until 1871. In several cases they claimed utterly different racial backgrounds from neighbours; Ireland being home to races such as the Delbhna, Conmaicne Mara, Cruithne, Eóganachta or Deirgtine, Érainn, Fir Bolg, Grecraighe, Laigin, Ulaid, Mairtine, Dáirine, and a host of others.
