5|$|Attacking and {{destroying}} the radar chain was also difficult. The stations were indeed vulnerable to dive bombers and low flying aircraft, however the British had mobile units {{which could be}} moved around to cover any gaps. Rapid repair services were also quick. Rarely were radar stations out of action for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{coastal areas}} {{bordering}} the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry summers and cool to cold, wet winters. Snow {{falls on the}} coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> However snow is rare in the coastal areas of the Aegean Sea and very rare in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to {{one part of}} the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E

5|$|In {{his final}} days, Irwin sold his rights from his {{scoreboard}} business for $2000. Though he sent $1500 to May and only $500 to Elizabeth, his Boston widow {{was surprised at}} the gesture since Irwin rarely visited Boston and provided almost no financial support to their family. In fact, May said that he had not been away from New York for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> at a time in 27 years. She said that his only long trips were baseball-related, when he would scout players in other cities. Before he left New York for the final time, he told May {{that he was going to}} say goodbye to friends in Boston and that he would return to New York. Though neither woman knew of the other, Irwin's New York son Harold learned about an unknown brother while he was visiting his father in the hospital just before Irwin's death.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe command {{understood}} that their support would be {{crucial for the}} success of Operation Citadel, but problems with supply shortfalls hampered their preparations. Partisan activity, particularly behind Army Group Center, slowed the rate of re-supply and cut short the Luftwaffe's ability to build up essential stockpiles of petrol, oil, lubricants, engines, munitions, and, unlike Red Army units there were no reserves of aircraft {{that could be used to}} replace damaged aircraft over the course of the operation. Fuel was the most significant limiting factor. To help build up supplies for the support of Citadel, the Luftwaffe greatly curtailed its operations during the last week of June. Despite this conservation of resources, the Luftwaffe did not have the resources to sustain an intensive air effort for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> after the operation began.|$|E
5|$|Before {{relation}} with his later wife Gertrud Weiss, Leo Szilard's life {{partner in the}} period 1927 – 1934 was kindergarten teacher and opera singer Gerda Philipsborn, who also worked as a volunteer in a Berlin asylum organization for refugee children and in 1932 moved to India to continue in this work. Szilard married Gertrud (Trude) Weiss, a physician, in a civil ceremony in New York on October 13, 1951. They {{had known each other}} since 1929, and had frequently corresponded and visited each other ever since. Weiss took up a teaching position at the University of Colorado in April 1950, and Szilard began staying with her in Denver {{for weeks at a time}} when they had never been together for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> before. Single people living together was frowned upon in the conservative United States at the time, and after they were discovered by one of her students, Szilard began to worry that she might lose her job. Their relationship remained a long-distance one, and they kept news of their marriage quiet. Many of his friends were shocked when they found out, as it was widely believed that Szilard was a born bachelor.|$|E

25|$|Many {{single-celled}} organisms called phytoplankton live in {{oceans and}} lakes.

25|$|Spinach is sold loose, bunched, {{packaged}} {{fresh in}} bags, canned, or frozen. Fresh spinach loses {{much of its}} nutritional value with storage of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> While refrigeration slows this effect to about eight days, spinach will lose most of its folate and carotenoid content, so for longer storage, it is blanched and frozen, cooked and frozen, or canned. Storage in the freezer can be for up to eight months.|$|E
25|$|Volume risk {{is often}} used to denote the {{phenomenon}} whereby electricity market participants have uncertain volumes or quantities of consumption or production. For example, a retailer is unable to accurately predict consumer demand for any particular hour <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> into the future and a producer is unable to predict the precise time that they will have plant outage or shortages of fuel. A compounding factor is also the common correlation between extreme price and volume events. For example, price spikes frequently occur when some producers have plant outages or when some consumers are in a period of peak consumption. The introduction of substantial amounts of intermittent power sources such as wind energy may affect market prices.|$|E
25|$|Chauncey Vibbard {{suffered}} a rare mechanical breakdown on Monday, August 5, 1878, {{on a trip}} from Albany. Approaching the Poughkeepsie landing, her starboard paddleshaft broke. Her 400 passengers and their baggage were disembarked at Poughkeepsie, and a special train commissioned {{to enable them to}} complete their journey. Temporary repairs were meanwhile made to Chauncey Vibbard, allowing her to complete the passage to New York at a slow speed, where she arrived about 10 pm. Damage was estimated at between $2,000 and $2,500, and Chauncey Vibbard was laid up at the foot of 22nd Street New York for the installation of a new shaft, which was expected to take no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> To replace her during the repairs, the reserve steamer Armenia was quickly readied for service, a task which included the transfer of Chauncey Vibbards bar fixtures and furniture. This breakdown {{was the first time in}} 13 years of service that Chauncey Vibbard had missed a scheduled trip.|$|E

25|$|The female lays {{her eggs}} {{as close to}} the food source as possible, and {{development}} is very rapid, allowing the larva to consume as much food as possible {{in a short period of}} time before transforming into the adult. The eggs hatch immediately after being laid, or the flies are ovoviviparous, with the larva hatching inside the mother. Larval flies, or maggots, have no true legs, and little demarcation between the thorax and abdomen; in the more derived species, the head is not clearly distinguishable from the rest of the body. Maggots are limbless, or else have small prolegs. The eyes and antennae are reduced or absent, and the abdomen also lacks appendages such as cerci. This lack of features is an adaptation to a food-rich environment, such as within rotting organic matter, or as an endoparasite. The pupae take various forms, and in some cases develop inside a silk cocoon. After emerging from the pupa, the adult fly rarely lives <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> and serves mainly to reproduce and to disperse in search of new food sources.|$|E
500|$|In addition, the Auxiliary Units {{included}} {{a network of}} civilian Special Duties personnel, recruited to provide a short-term intelligence gathering service, spying on enemy formations and troop movements. Reports were to be collected from dead letter drops and, from 1941, relayed by civilian radio operators [...] from secret locations. The wireless network did, however, only become operational from 1941 and was based upon a very rigid system which meant that it was unlikely to survive <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> following invasion. [...] More important in 1940 for intelligence gathering were the mobile patrols of the GHQ Liaison Unit ('Phantom'), which were staffed by skilled linguists and equipped with powerful wireless sets for direct communication with GHQ.|$|E
500|$|Metternich {{travelled}} with Dorothea Lieven to Brussels {{soon after}} the congress broke up, and although he could not stay <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> the pair exchanged letters for the next eight years. He arrived in Vienna on 11 December 1818 and {{was finally able to}} spend considerable time with his children. He entertained the Tsar during the Christmas season and spent twelve weeks monitoring Italy and Germany before setting off with the Emperor on a third trip to Italy. The trip was cut short by the assassination of the conservative German dramatist August von Kotzebue. After a short delay, Metternich decided that if the German governments would not act against this perceived problem, Austria would have to compel them. He called an informal conference in Karlsbad and sounded out Prussian support beforehand by meeting with Frederick William III of Prussia in Teplice in July. Metternich carried the day, using a recent attempt on the life of the Chief Minister of Nassau, Carl Ibell to win agreement for the conservative program now known as the Convention of Teplitz. The Karlsbad conference opened on 6 August and ran {{for the rest of the}} month. Metternich overcame any opposition to his proposed [...] "group of anti-revolutionary measures, correct and preemptory", although they were condemned by outsiders. Despite censure Metternich was very pleased with the result, known as the [...] "Karlsbad Decrees".|$|E
