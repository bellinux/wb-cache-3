40|$|Introduction: Vibratory {{stimulation}} {{has been}} reported as an effective means in reducing the orthodontic pain. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of vibratory stimulation from powered-toothbrushes as a noninvasive and nonpharmacological method of reducing pain caused after initial archwire placement and to compare it with other common modalities of management. Materials and Methods: This clinical trial included 75 patients of age 13 â 25 years, scheduled for fixed mechanotherapy. Patients were divided into five groups: Control, placebo multivitamin, paracetamol, chewing-gum (Cg), and powered-toothbrush. After placement of 0. 016 â³ Nickel Titanium initial archwire (upper/lower) in each patient, the discomfort perceived at 2 h, 6 h, bedtime, 24 h, 2 days, 3 days, and 7 days were <b>marked</b> <b>individually</b> using Wong-Baker (0 â 5) and numeric (0 â 10) pain rating scales. KruskalâWallis test, Friedman test, unpaired t-test were used for statistical analysis. Results: Vibratory stimulation from powered-toothbrushes effectively reduced pain after initial archwire placement. It did not alter the pattern of pain perception, but significantly reduced the overall intensity of pain at each time interval. Cg was not found effective enough to be recommended as a routine treatment modality. Conclusion: Powered-toothbrushes can be recommended as a nonpharmacological and noninvasive substitute for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for effective pain reduction in the clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|Population {{ecology and}} {{reproduction}} of the fat dormouse (Myoxus glis L.) were studied in central Germany in the years 1992 and 1993. Animals were captured in wooden live-traps twice a month, during trapping periods lasting three days each, and <b>marked</b> <b>individually</b> by tattooing. Demographic results show that, in three subpopulations, population structure differed extremely between 1992 and 1993. In 1992, more adult than subadult dormice occurred {{in the study area}} and the reverse was found in 1993. Subadults emerged from hibernation a little before or together with adult dormice. Adult males emerged signiÂ®cantly earlier than adult females. After a year with good reproductive success (1992), a total lack of reproduction was observed in 1993. Juvenile dormice were neither found in traps nor in nest-boxes. The assessment of gonadal states indicated that all males (adult and subadult) remained in a state of testicular regression throughout the year 1993. Also, no female was found lactating. Reproductive failure coincided with a lack of food resources in the autumn of 1993 (e. g. fruits of oaks and beeches). Body mass changes imply high energy expenditure prior to mating in adult males. It seems likely that males in years with low food availability do not invest energy in reproduction. Key words: Glis glis/Myoxus glis, body weight, population ecology, breeding, mating effor...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{adaptation}} of the spider crab Inachus phalangium (Fabricius, 1755) to one of its sea anemone host species, Anemonia viridis (ForsskÃ¥l, 1775) in the coastal region of Rovinj, Croatia. Similar to other brachyuran species, Inachus spp. generally lives within the anemone to obtain protection from possible predators. Using removal and reintroduction experiments, this study investigates the protection mechanism and shows a loss of adaptation {{after a period of}} 10 days when the crabs are taken out of their host and kept solitary. Thirty-nine anemones from two different trial sites were <b>marked</b> <b>individually</b> and the inhabiting crabs were isolated to be released back into their individual hosts later. The reactions of the anemones were closely observed and characterized to determine the respective state of crab adaptation. As 35 out of 39 individuals provoked a defense /attack reaction of the anemone, it is concluded that the crabs possessed some sort of non-permanent protection mechanism that was lost during the test run (chi-square test, p < 0. 00014). All tested crabs re-inhabited their host anemones within a maximum of 20 minutes after they had been reintroduced and stung by the anemones. Therefore, habituation to the hostâs defense / attack mechanism is acquired individually and not genetically inherent to the species. The results are compared to adaptation and protection data on other decapod crustaceans and some anemonefishes...|$|E

It is increasingly recognised that the study of DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns along the genome [...] so-called `epialleles' [...] offers greater insight into epigenetic dynamics than conventional analyses which examine DNAm <b>marks</b> <b>individually.</b> Results: We have developed a Bayesian model to infer which epialleles are present in multiple regions of the same tumour. We apply our method to reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data from multiple regions of one lung cancer tumour and a matched normal sample. The model borrows information from all tumour regions to leverage greater statistical power. The total number of epialleles, the epiallele DNAm patterns, and a noise hyperparameter are all automatically inferred from the data. Uncertainty as to which epiallele an observed sequencing read originated from is explicitly incorporated by marginalising over the appropriate posterior densities. The degree to which tumour samples are contaminated with normal tissue can be estimated and corrected for. By tracing the distribution of epialleles throughout the tumour we can infer the phylogenetic history of the tumour, identify epialleles that differ between normal and cancer tissue, and define a measure of global epigenetic disorder...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{studied the}} {{response}} of males to the singing of nearby male conspecifics in two species of the orthopteran genus Cyphoderris, primitive relatives of crickets and katydids. Lone male Cyphoderris buckelli stridulating in a large cage made a phonotactic approach to a nearby speaker broadcasting conspecific calling song. But in field experiments no phonotaxis to song broadcasts occurred; rather, {{a significant number of}} male C. buckelli increased their chirp duty cycle and pulse rate. There was no change in their carrier frequency. Calling male Cyphoderris monstrosa were exposed in the field to (i) playback of a synthetic calling song at a typical conspecific pulse rate, (ii) relayed broadcast of their own call, and (iii) low-frequency audio noise. Call duty cycle decreased significantly in response to the noise, while the pooled song models fell just short of significance. Singing C. buckelli were <b>marked</b> <b>individually</b> and their perches flagged over successive nights. We observed low site fidelity and extensive male displacement. Such behaviour is inconsistent with defense of topographically fixed singing territories and concurs with the absence of fighting in this species. Chirp duty cycle was increased significantly in C. buckelli in response to the singing of nearby conspecifics, but unlike in C. monstrosa, this change in duty cycle plays no role in overt aggression, though it may maintain a maleâs relative attractiveness to females.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding the {{trade-off}} between current reproductive effort, future survival and future breeding attempts {{is crucial for}} demographic analyses and life history studies. We investigated this trade-off in a population of king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) <b>marked</b> <b>individually</b> with transponders using multistate capture-recapture models. This colonial seabird species has a low annual proportion of non-breeders (13 %), despite a breeding cycle which lasts over 1 year. To draw inferences {{about the consequences of}} non-breeding, we tested for an effect of reproductive activity on survival and on the probability of subsequent breeding. We found that birds non-breeding in year t show the same survival rate as breeders (two-states analysis: breeding and non-breeding). However, breeders had a lower probability of breeding again the following year. This negative phenotypic correlation suggests the existence of reproductive costs affecting future breeding probability, but it might also be strengthened by late arrival for courtship in year t. A three-state analysis including breeding success revealed that failed breeders in year t have a lower probability to reproduce successfully in year t + 1 than non-breeders in year t, providing some evidence for the existence of reproductive costs. Moreover, successful breeders showed higher survival probability. This positive phenotypic correlation between current reproduction and subsequent survival supports the hypothesis of an heterogeneity in individual quality. Males breeding in year t had a lower probability to breed again in year t + 1 than females, suggesting higher reproductive costs for this sex. Such additional costs might be due to higher male parental investment in the final phase of chick-rearing, which also delays the arrival of males in year t + 1, and decreases their breeding probability. Our study is the first to explore the breeding biology and the demography of penguins without the disturbance of flipper-bands...|$|E

The study {{was carried out in}} a property located in the north of the County of Valladolid (Spain). Nine wild adult animals, 2 males and 7 females, were used. They were <b>marked</b> <b>individually</b> with a microchip (AVID(r)). These animals were lodged in a 0. 5 ha. enclosure. It was composed of two areas, one smaller where burrows were located and a bigger area, in which animals had fresh food and water. Both areas were separated by a metallic net provided of two passageways, in which, two microchips readers were placed to register animal activity. Each register indicated date, hour and code of the animal that had gone through the passageway. An activity rate was determined as the number of times that the total of the animals went through all the passageways, per hour of each day of the study. A monthly index of activity was also determined by the average of the daily activity rates during each month. It was observed that wild rabbits present a pronounced twilight and night-time activity, with two activity peaks which coincide with the sunrise and sunset. It was also determined that the activity of the animals in central hours of the day was practically null in both sexes. The activity pattern was changing, gradually, in function of the hour of sunrise and sunset on each month of the study. The activity index increased from September on, reaching a maximum peak during December, and decreased gradually until February when this index increased slightly until the finalization of the study on March. This pattern can be associated with the reproductive rhythms of the wild rabbit in the study area, during this period...|$|E
40|$|Footpad {{dermatitis}} {{also known}} as plantar pododermatitis is a condition characterized by lesions on the ventral footpads of poultry. Lesions vary from hyperkeratosis to discoloration and ulcerations. They can heal with leaving a scar. Affected birds dontât limp generally, but show less locomotion. Among the genetic disposition, different predisposing factors leading to pododermatitis have been discussed. The gender of animals, a feed composition not according the needs of animals, litter material, litter quality, and {{last but not least}} stocking density may have influence on the development of pododermatitis. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the impact stocking density and litter material have on the severity of pododermatitis in meat-type turkey hens and toms. A summer- (april until september) and a winter-course (october until february) was conducted with a total of 7931 hens and 4283 toms of the turkey strain B. U. T. Big 6. Animals were divided into four groups in each gender. Each group was divided into four sub-groups. Three groups were held in different stocking densities on not chaffed straw, one group was held on wood shavings. Stocking densities for the groups with low stocking density (Sn) were for the hens in summer 49, 36 kg/m 2 and in winter 53, 22 kg/m 2. In toms, the low stocking density was 43, 69 kg/m 2 (summer) and 53, 32 kg/m 2 (winter). Medium density (Sm) was 60, 18 kg/m 2 (summer) and 62, 81 kg/m 2 (winter) for the hens and 55, 63 kg/m 2 (summer) respectively 62, 27 kg/m 2 (winter) for the toms. High stocking density (Sh) was for the hens 68, 39 kg/m 2 (summer) and in winter 73 kg/m 2. For the toms, the high stocking density was 58, 17 kg/m 2 in summer and 74, 32 kg/m 2 in winter. The groups on wood shavings (Hm) had been kept at medium densities of 59, 42 kg/m 2 (summer) and 60, 77 kg/m 2 (winter) for the hens and 53, 38 kg/m 2 (summer) respectively 63, 55 kg/m 2 (winter) for the hens. To ensure a constant litter quality, fresh litter was added to all groups regularly and dry matter of the litter was detected. In each of the four sub-groups per group, 20 animals were <b>marked</b> <b>individually.</b> From the first week on until slaughter in 16 th (hens) / 21 st week, foot pad health of these animals was scored with six possible scores fortnightly. Additionally, the scores were classified: A (no lesions, score 1), B (mild lesions, score 2, 3 and 4), C (severe lesions, score 5 and 6). Foot pads of 20 animals per group were taken for histopathological examination at the end of the winter-course. In summer, the mean scores of the three female groups with straw showed significant differences between group Sn (lower) and group Sh (higher) in week 11 and 13. In the male groups mean score of goup Sn was significantly lower than of group Sh from week 9 to 17. The hens of all groups showed lesions of class C in week 15, scores of toms in week 21 were class B. In winter, group Sn of the hens had a significantly lower mean score in week 7 and 13 than group Sh. The mean score of the male group Sn was significantly higher in week 5 than mean score of group Sh. In week 7, mean score of group Sn was significantly lower than in group Sh. Lesions of toms in week 21 were in class B, lesions of hens in week 15 in class C. These findings show no reproducible impact of stocking density on pododermatitis. In summer, the female group on wood shavings (Hm) had a significantly lower mean score than group Sm in week 11, 13 and 15. The toms of group Hm had a significantly lower mean score than group Sm from week 13 on until slaughter. Lesions of hens in week 15 were in class C in group Sm and in class B in group Hm. The toms lesions in week 21 were in class B in both groups. In week 7 in winter, mean score of group Sm was significantly lower than in group Hm. In week 11 and 15 mean score of group Hm was the significantly lower one. From week 11 on until slaughter, group Hm of the toms had a significanty lower mean score than group Sm. In thie course the lesions of hens in week 15 were in class C, lesions of hens in week 21 in class B. Based on these data it is concluded that litter material has an impact on foot pad health. Turkey hens turned out to be the more affected with pododermatitis gender in this study. Until slaughter in week 15, hens have a higher mean score compared to toms in the same week in both courses. Furthermore, it was necessary to add more fresh litter into the hens groups than into the toms. The better foot pad health in summer is attributed to the climatic conditions, wich led to better litter quality wich means drier litter in summer. In winter, dry matter in the litter samples was lower, although more fresh litter was added than in summer. The analysis of the findings of the histopathological examination by chi-square-test shows that in group Hm of each gender and in both courses there are statistically more scars as an after-effect of a score class C than in the other groups. Taken together the results of this study show no effect of stocking density on the development of pododermatitis in meat-type turkeys. Litter quality - especially depending on climatic conditions - has a big impact on development of pododermatitis. Litter material (long, not chaffed straw versus wood shavings), has also a clear influence on foot pad health, but it canât compensate the effect of litter quality: animals kept on wood shavings had better foot pad health as animals kept on long straw...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} insect {{dispersal}} plays {{an essential role}} in estimating the spread of damage caused by a newly invaded pest or the spatial distribution of an insect during the active period in growing season. Moreover concerning dispersal, quantitative information performs {{a crucial role in the}} evaluation and implementation of pest control. Since rearing clean and healthy insects in sufficient numbers is the most important prerequisite for many basic research programs and for developing pest control strategies, mass rearing of the Codling moth on the artificial diet carried out as the first step at optimum conditions. With regard to the fundamental function of feeding and pre-releasing handling on insect biological attributes, we intended to evaluate the individual marking influence on longevity of Codling moths in the next step. For this purpose, one day old adult male and female moths were kept three and five minutes at - 20 Â°C to make them motionless, then immediately <b>marked</b> <b>individually</b> with felt tip pens and coded by the different colors, maintained under optimum condition and checked daily for 13 days. The proposed linear model accounted for 89 % of the variations. Numbing and marking process influenced of the moths longevity regardless of their sex while the duration of the anesthetize does not affect the survival of moths meaningfully. Regarding the obstacles associated with egg and pupa storage of Codling moth, we examined the possibility of adult moth?s storage in low temperature in order to evaluate its e&# 64256;ect on longevity of moths. Adult 12 - 24 h old male and female moths were treated separately and maintained in 4 &# 9702;C and (0 : 24 h, L:D) photoperiod during the entire adult life. The survival rate evaluated with two days interval throughout 27 days. The effects of day and treatment were significant. It seems that the female moths tolerate the cold condition better and further than the male moths and live longer. Additionally the proposed models accounted for 71 % and 57 % of the variations for male and females respectively as verified more affection and debility of the males by the storage condition. Disadvantages of individual marking led us to test the mass marking and it?s influence on the survival of the moths. One-day-old moths were marked with fluorescent powder. Mortality of the males and females recorded daily for a 20 days period. Results indicated that the effects of the sex, the replications and interaction of them were significant as well as the effect of the day. The model accounted for 96 % of the variations. This study indicated that male and female moths were in&# 64258;uenced by the &# 64258;uorescent powder. Findings of this study may facilitate the improvement of mark-release experiment results and interpretation more precisely in particular for dispersal studies. In the field experiments, firstly trade off trap structure in assessing the horizontal and vertical distribution of Codling moth carried out as well as outward and inward dispersal. Three different types of the traps including Delta pheromone traps, Delta Pear ester trap and Cylinder shape Pear ester traps were used in the research station of the Hohenheim University. Ninety six traps were suspended in eight compass directions in order of four traps per direction, at three heights in random arrangement in outward dispersal. In inward dispersal study the traps arrangement and number was the same but dissimilarly the releasing site was from borders of directions SW, NW, W, E, and SE. The traps were checked daily and followed nine days after release. Results demonstrated no significant differences between three types of traps in attracting the marked and feral females ?Fn?. Meanwhile significant dissimilarity in marked and feral male ?Mn? catches were traced. Reaction of the moths to the traps elevation was not similar in the vertical distribution study. whereas marked female moths exhibited significant differences to different heights, marked and feral male and ?Fn? moths revealed no difference reaction to traps in different heights. In horizontal distribution study marked female moths ?Fr? exhibited significant differences. It is revealed that dominant directions for marked and feral moths were different. Concerning inward distribution, both marked male ?Mr? and female demonstrated significant differences in their direction and distances. In regard to this findings and priceless and effortless manufacturing of the Cylinder traps, utilization of this trap in mark-release-recapture studies of female and male Codling moths is recommended. Effect of apple cultivar on pheromone and Pear ester trap efficiency studied as the next tread. In this experiment 32 Delta pheromone traps and 32 Cylinder-shape Pear ester traps impartially mounted on different varieties of apple trees. Artificially reared and marked 24 to 26 h old moths were released at 1 m height from a central point. Among the simple effects the most important explanatory variable for the response variables ?Mn? and ?Fn? moths was sampling dates of moths, while the variety and distance from the releasing point for ?Mn? and the variety and trap height for ?Fn? were the second and third influential variables respectively. Moreover among the nested effects the interaction of distance-height-variety was the most influential one for ?Mn? likewise the interactions of date, release point, direction and trap height with the variety were the most influential for ?Fn?. For the ?Mr? and ?Fr? moths releasing date was the most important influential variable, while the trap type and variety for ?Mr? and variety and trap height for the ?Fr? were the second and third influential variables respectively. Current study revealed that dispersal of the feral and marked-released male and female Codling moths influenced by host cultivars distinctly and decidedly. Meanwhile, quantifying these relationships and propose distinct model for marked and feral male and female moths are the exclusive characteristics of present findings. The next stage of present study related to study of climatic factors on dispersal of Codling moth. In this study, Hohenheim station climatic data were used. Several climatic elements including temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed in two different heights (2. 5 m and 10 m), Day Degree, twilight temperature, wind speed and precipitation were utilized in the analysis. Diversity and high number of variables led us to use AIC method for selecting of appropriate regressors and fitted model. The main regressors that infÃ¶uenced the ?Fr? were flight height, ageing, twilight wind speed (2. 5 m heights) and precipitation. For the ?Mr? the same regressors plus the distance from the releasing point were the best subset. In the case of the feral moths the flight height, relative humidity, Day Degree, twilight temperature and wind speed were the best subset regressors. Comprehensively we concluded that present study provides new knowledge in basic as well as in applied science. Twilight temperature, rainfall, wind speed and Day Degree impress the distribution of the moths in a superior way than the circadian weather data. This knowledge could mitigate confusion which arises from observations of erratic flight patterns and could lead to fewer treatment decision errors in the future. Also may accelerate and strengthen forecasting programs of this key pest as well as the related management tactics. The combination of mark-release-recapture and diffusion models have been shown to be effective for measuring insect dispersal. We attempted to measure the Codling moth dispersal using traps placed at different distances and heights. Diffusion coefficient calculated for horizontal and vertical dispersal of male and female moths distinctly using direct and indirect methods and resulting models were compared. We fitted the non-linear regression using the iterative process and estimating the parameters accuracy were tested according to the default asymptotic 95 % confidence intervals calculation in non-linear regression. Considering the overall models, suitability of three factors fitted models was more convincible than that of two factors model particularly for male moths. Meanwhile we found great difference in the diffusion coeffcient of direct and indirect methods. Regardless of the model type, the R 2 was relatively high in our experiments which evaluate how well the model fits data. We have shown that the diffusion model leads to powerful techniques for the analysis of dispersal data at least for one economically important insect. In conclusion, the present study provides an estimate of population spread by Codling moth using estimated rates of reproduction and dispersal, quantified the association between various key factors and Codling moth movement for the first time using the diffusion model. By including additional parameter to the diffusion model the predictive explanatory potential of this method was improved for dispersal studies at least for a cosmopolitan and critical insect. Untersuchungen zur Insektenverbreitung sind eine wichtige Grundlage fÃ¼r Voraussagen Ã¼ber das Vordringen eines neu eingewanderten SchÃ¤dlings auf dem Luftweg oder die rÃ¤umliche Verteilung eines Insekts wÃ¤hrend seiner aktiven Periode in der Anbausaison. DarÂ¨uber hinaus spielen quantitative Aussagen zur Verbreitung eine entscheidende Rolle in der Bewertung und Umsetzung von PflanzenschutzmaÃnahmen. Da die Aufzucht gesunder Insekten in ausreichender Zahl die wichtigste Voraussetzung fÃ¼r viele grundlegende Forschungsvorhaben und fÃ¼r die Entwicklung von Pflanzenschutzstrategien darstellt, war der erste Schritt die Massenzucht des Apfelwicklers auf kÃ¼nstlicher DiÃ¤t unter optimalen Bedingungen. Aufgrund der erheblichen Auswirkungen von FÃ¼tterungs- und Handhabungsbedingungen auf die biologischen Eigenschaften der Insekten beabsichtigten wir, im nÃ¤chsten Schritt den EinfluÃ der Markierung auf die Lebensdauer der Apfelwickler zu untersuchen. Dazu wurden einen Tag alte ausgewachsene mÃ¤nnliche und weibliche Tiere drei und fÃ¼nf Minuten einer Temperatur von - 20 Â°C ausgesetzt, um sie bewegungsunfÃ¤hig zu machen, sofort mit verschiedenfarbigen Filzschreibern nach einem Farbschema individuell markiert und dann 13 Tage unter optimalen Bedingungen gehalten und tÃ¤glich kontrolliert. Das vorgeschlagene lineare Modell deckt 89 % der Variationen ab. Der EinfluÃ des BetÃ¤ubungs- und Markierungsvorgangs auf die Lebensdauer der Tiere war bei beiden Geschlechtern gleich, dabei hatte die Dauer der BetÃ¤ubung keine entscheidenden Auswirkungen auf die Ãberlebensrate der Falter. Angesichts der Schwierigkeiten, Eier und Puppen des Apfelwicklers zu lagern, untersuchten wir die MÃ¶glichkeit, adulte Tiere bei niedriger Temperatur zu halten, um mÃ¶gliche Auswirkungen auf die Lebensdauer der Insekten zu erfassen. Ausgewachsene 12 - 24 h alte mÃ¤nnliche und weibliche Falter wurden getrennt behandelt und wÃ¤hrend ihrer gesamten Lebensdauer bei 4 Â°C und einer Photoperiode von (0 : 24 h, L:D) gehalten. Die Ãberlebensrate wurde 27 Tage lang jeden zweiten Tag erhoben. Der Zusammenhang von Lebensdauer und Behandlung war signifikant. Es scheint, daÃ die weiblichen Tiere KÃ¤lte besser ertragen als die mÃ¤nnlichen und lÃ¤nger leben. Die vorgeschlagenen Modelle beschreiben jeweils 71 % bzw. 57 % der Variationen fÃ¼r MÃ¤nnchen und Weibchen und bestÃ¤tigen hÃ¶here AnfÃ¤lligkeit und Sterblichkeit der MÃ¤nnchen unter Lagerbedingungen. Nachteile der individuellen Markierungsmethode veranlassten uns, Massenkennzeichnungen und ihren EinfluÃ auf die Ãberlebensrate der Insekten zu untersuchen. Einen Tag alte Tiere wurden mit fluoreszierendem Puder gekennzeichnet, die Sterblichkeit von MÃ¤nnchen und Weibchen Ã¼ber zwanzig Tage tÃ¤glich aufgezeichnet. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, daÃ der Zusammenhang zwischen GeschlechtszugehÃ¶rigkeit, den Wiederholungen, ihrem Zusammenwirken und dem Tag der Erhebung signifikant war. Das Modell beschrieb 96 % der Variationen. Der Versuch zeigte, daÃ mÃ¤nnliche wie weibliche Falter durch den fluoreszierenden Puder beeinflusst werden. Die Ergebnisse der Untersuchungen kÃ¶nnen zur Verbesserung von Wiederfang-Versuchen beitragen und helfen, ihre Ergebnisse aussagekrÃ¤ftiger zu machen, insbesondere fÃ¼r Verbreitungsstudien. In den Freilandexperimenten wurde zuerst eine Anordnung von Fallen eingesetzt, um die horizontale und vertikale Verteilung der Apfelwickler sowie ihre Ausbreitungsdynamik zu erfassen. Drei verschiedene Arten von Fallen wurden auf der Versuchsstation der UniversitÃ¤t Hohenheim verwendet: delta-Fallen mit Pheromon, delta-Fallen mit Birnenester und Zylinderfallen mit Birnenester. Um die auswÃ¤rts gerichtete Ausbreitung zu erfassen, wurden sechsundneunzig Fallen in acht Himmelsrichtungen, vier in jeder Richtung, auf drei verschiedene HÂ¨ohen zufÃ¤llig verteilt angebracht. Die Anordnung zur Erfassung der einwÃ¤rtigen Ausbreitung war gleich, aber die Freisetzung erfolgte an den in den Richtungen SW, NW, W, O, und SO gelegenen Grenzen der VersuchsflÃ¤che. Die Fallen wurden neun Tage nach der Freisetzung tÃ¤glich Ã¼berprÃ¼ft. Die Ergebnisse zeigten keine signifikanten Unterschiede zwischen den drei Arten von Fallen in ihrer Anziehung auf markierte und wilde Weibchen 'Fn'. Zwischen den Fangraten an markierten und wilden MÃ¤nnchen 'Mn' lieÃ sich jedoch ein signifikanter Unterschied nachweisen. Die Reaktion der Falter auf die HÃ¶he der Fallen Ã¼ber dem Boden war unterschiedlich. WÃ¤hrend markierte weibliche Tiere signifikante Vorlieben fÃ¼r bestimmte HÃ¶hen aufwiesen, war bei markierten und wilden MÃ¤nnchen sowie wilden Weibchen kein Unterschied in der Reaktion auf verschieden hoch angebrachte Fallen zu erkennen. BezÃ¼glich der horizontalen Ausbreitung zeigten markierte weibliche Falter 'Fr' signifikante Unterschiede. Es erwies sich, daÃ die bevorzugten Richtungen fÃ¼r markierte und wilde Apfelwickler-Motten unterschiedlich waren. Betreffs der migration Ausbreitung wiesen sowohl markierte MÃ¤nnchen 'Mr' als auch Weibchen signifikante Unterschiede in Richtung und Entfernungen auf. Angesichts dieser Ergebnisse sowie der billigen und einfachen Herstellung der zylindrischen Fallen wird ihre Anwendung in Wiederfang-Versuchen mit mÃ¤nnlichen und weiblichen Apfelwicklern empfohlen. Im nÃ¤chsten Schritt wurde der EinfluÃ von Wirtstypeen auf die Wirksamkeit der Pheromonund Birnenester-Fallen studiert. In diesem Versuch wurden 32 deltaFallen mit Pheromon und 32 Zylinderfallen mit Birnenester zufÃ¤llig verteilt auf ApfelbÃ¤umen verschiedener Sorten angebracht. Im Labor aufgezogene und markierte 24 - 26 h alte Falter wurden an einem zentralen Punkt in 1 m HÃ¶he freigelassen. Unter den einfachen ZusammenhÃ¤ngen war das Erhebungsdatum die Ausgangsvariable mit dem grÃ¶Ãten EinfluÃ auf die Ergebnisvariablen 'Mn' und 'Fn', an zweiter und dritter Stelle kamen Sorte und Entfernung vom Ort der Freilassung fÃ¼r 'Mn' bzw. Sorte und HÃ¶he der Falle fÂ¨ur 'Fn'. Unter den ZusammenhÃ¤ngen hÃ¶herer Ordnung war das Zusammenwirken von Entfernung, HÃ¶he und Sorte am einfluÃreichsten fÃ¼r 'Mn', dagegen jenes von Datum, Freisetzungtype, Richtung, FallenhÃ¶he und Sorte am wichtigsten fÃ¼r 'Fn'. FÂ¨ur 'Mr' und 'Fr' war das Freilassungsdatum die bedeutendste beeinflussende Variable, wÃ¤hrend die Art der Falle und die Sorte fÃ¼r 'Mr' bzw. die Sorte und FallenhÃ¶he fÃ¼r 'Fr' den zweiten und dritten Rang einnahmen. Die vorliegende Studie zeigte auf, daÃ die Ausbreitung sowohl von wilden als auch markierten und freigelassenen mÃ¤nnlichen wie weiblichen Apfelwicklern entscheidend und deutlich von den Wirtstypeen beeinflusst wird. Diese VerhÃ¤ltnisse werden erstmalig quantitativ beschrieben und ein geeignetes Modell fÃ¼r markierte wie wilde, mÃ¤nnliche und weibliche Falter vorgeschlagen. Der nÃ¤chste Abschnitt der vorliegenden Arbeit beschÃ¤ftigte sich mit dem EinfluÃ klimatischer Faktoren auf die Ausbreitung des Apfelwicklers. Zu diesem Zweck wurden Daten der Meteorologischen Station Hohenheim verwendet. Verschiedene Klimafaktoren, wie Temperatur, Rel. Feuchte, Niederschlag, Windgeschwindigkeit in zwei verschiedenen HÃ¶hen (2, 5 m und 10 m), Gradtage und DÃ¤mmerungstemperatur gingen in die Analyse ein. Die Verschiedenheit und Vielzahl der Variablen veranlasste uns, die AIC-Methode zu verwenden, um angemessene Regressoren und ein passendes Modell zu finden. Die Hauptregressoren, welche die Variable 'Fr' beeinflussten, waren FlughÃ¶he, Alter, Windgeschwindigkeit in der DÃ¤mmerung (2, 5 m HÃ¶he) und Niederschlag. Bei 'Mr' bildeten dieselben Regressoren und zusÃ¤tzlich der Abstand vom Ort der Freisetzung die beste Auswahl. FÂ¨ur die wilden Falter stellten FlughÃ¶he, Rel. Feuchte, Gradtag, DÃ¤mmerungstemperatur und Windgeschwindigkeit den besten Satz an Regressoren dar. Zusammenfassend ist festzustellen, daÃ die vorliegende Studie neue Einsichten fÃ¼r die angewandte wie auch die Grundlagenforschung bereithÃ¤lt. DÃ¤mmerungstemperatur, Regen, Windgeschwindigkeit und Gradtag bestimmen die Ausbreitung der Apfelwickler sehr viel stÃ¤rker als das Wetter tagsÃ¼ber. Diese Erkenntnis kÃ¶nnte die aus der Beobachtung unvorhersagbarer FlugaktivitÃ¤t herrÃ¼hrende Verwirrung verringern und in der Zukunft zu weniger Fehlentscheidungen Ã¼ber BehandlungsmaÃnahmen fÃ¼hren. Sie kann auÃerdem Vorhersagen zum Auftreten dieses wichtigen SchÃ¤dlings und damit Managementstrategien vereinfachen und absichern. Die Kombination von Wiederfang-Versuchen und Verteilungsmodellen hat sich als effektiv zur Bestimmung der Ausbreitung von Insekten erwiesen. Wir haben versucht, mit Hilfe von in verschiedenen Entfernungen und HÃ¶hen angebrachten Fallen die Ausbreitung des Apfelwicklers zu bestimmen. Die Verteilungskoeffizienten, berechnet jeweils fÃ¼r horizontale und vertikale Ausbreitung von weiblichen und mÃ¤nnlichen Faltern unter Verwendung von direkten und indirekten Methoden sowie die resultierenden Modelle wurden verglichen. Mittels iterativer Methoden ermittelten wir eine passende nonlineare Regression und schÃ¤tzten die Genauigkeit der NÃ¤herung unter Zugrundelegung eines 95 %-Vertrauensintervalls. Im Vergleich war ein auf drei Faktoren beruhendes Modell Ã¼berzeugender als ein nur zwei Faktoren berÃ¼cksichtigendes, insbesondere bezÃ¼glich mÃ¤nnlicher Falter. Allerdings fanden wir groÃe Unterschiede in den Verteilungskoeffizienten zwischen direkten und indirekten Methoden. UnabhÃ¤ngig von der Art des Modells war R 2 in unseren Versuchen, zu ermitteln, wie gut das Modell mit den Daten Ã¼bereinstimmt, relativ hoch. Wir haben gezeigt, daÃ das Verteilungsmodell zur Analyse von Ausbreitungsdaten zumindest fÃ¼r ein wirtschaftlich bedeutendes Insekt ein leistungsfÃ¤higes Werkzeug darstellt. SchlieÃlich stellt die vorliegende Studie unter Verwendung geschÃ¤tzter Vermehrungsraten und Ausbreitungsgeschwindigkeiten eine AbschÃ¤tzung der Ausbreitung des Apfelwicklers bereit und beschreibt unter Verwendung eines Verteilungsmodells erstmalig quantitativ den Zusammenhang zwischen verschiedenen SchlÃ¼sselfaktoren und MobilitÃ¤t des Apfelwicklers. Durch Einbeziehung zusÃ¤tzlicher Parameter fÃ¼r das Verteilungsmodell konnte das Potential dieser Methode fÃ¼r ErklÃ¤rung und Vorhersage im Rahmen von Ausbreitungsstudien zumindest fÃ¼r ein weltweit vorkommendes und wichtiges Insekt verbessert werden...|$|E

It is particularly useful when dealing with animals {{that are difficult to}} <b>mark</b> <b>individually.</b> For the first time, we provide the likelihood for extended batch-marking experiments. It is often the case that samples contain individuals that remain unmarked, due to time and other constraints, and this information has not previously been analyzed. We provide ways of modeling such information, including an open N-mixture approach. We demonstrate that models for both marked and unmarked individuals are hidden Markov models; this provides a unified approach, and is the key to developing methods for fast likelihood computation and maximization. Likelihoods for marked and unmarked individuals can easily be combined using integrated population modeling. This allows the simultaneous estimation of population size and immigration, in addition to survival, as well as efficient estimation of standard errors and methods of model selection and evaluation, using standard likelihood techniques. Alternative methods for estimating population size are presented and compared. An illustration is provided by a weather-loach data set, previously analyzed by means of a complex procedure of constructing a pseudo likelihood, the formation of estimating equations, the use of sandwich estimates of variance, and piecemeal estimation of population size. Simulation provides general validation of the hidden Markov model methods developed and demonstrates their excellent performance and efficiency.
