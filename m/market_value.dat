The two {{disagreed}} on the valuation of the site, Davies offered what {{was believed to be}} the market price of GB£3.5M, Goodway demanded £14M for the relocation of Council staff. In October 1997, both the Welsh Office and Cardiff Council agreed to the District Valuer providing an independent assessment of the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of Cardiff City Hall and the cost of staff relocating to an equivalent standard of accommodation. The District Valuer advised that the open <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of Cardiff City Hall was £3.5M. There was not enough information available for the District Valuer to make a decision. A bid of £2.5M was made by the Welsh Office on 14 November 1997, which was rejected on 21 November 1997. A final offer of £3.5M was made on 24 November and this too was rejected by Cardiff County Council. Davies later announced his decision not {{to go ahead with the}} Cardiff City Hall site for the National Assembly.|$|E

The City of London, preoccupied with its own grievances, refused to make any loans to the king, as did foreign powers. In this extremity, in July Charles seized silver bullion worth £130,000 held in trust at the mint in the Tower of London, promising its later return at 8% interest to its owners. In August, after the East India Company refused to grant a loan, Lord Cottington seized the company's stock of pepper and spices and sold it for £60,000 (far below its <b>market</b> <b>value),</b> promising to refund the money with interest later.|$|E

5|$|By 1980, Gulf {{exhibited}} many of {{the characteristics}} of a giant corporation that had lost its way. It had a huge but poorly performing asset portfolio, associated with a depressed share price. The stock <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of Gulf started to drop below the break-up value of its assets. Such a situation was bound to attract the interest of corporate raiders, although a corporation in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 was in the early 1980s thought immune to takeover risk.|$|E

By this time, the asking price for the building had dropped to $425,000, which {{was estimated to be}} $8000 below its real <b>market</b> <b>value.</b> The Foundation began to make major upgrades and repairs to the interior of the building. A fundraising drive in 1987 allowed 422 modern sized plush seats to be installed, lowering the theatre’s original seating capacity by almost 240. In 1989, a soundproofed cry room was installed with an independent sound system, allowing patrons with small children to come to films without worry.|$|E

The objective of the mechanism was to inject large amounts of money into the economy in an indirect way, through material goods, so that inflation would be avoided. However, the initiative failed to generate much economic development, as licenseholders spent most of their funds on consumer goods.|$|E

The intention is to exploit temporary f luctuations in the cost of equity relative to the cost of other forms of capital. In the efficient and integrated capital markets stud-ied by Modigliani and Miller ~ 1958 !, the costs of different forms of capital do not vary independently, so there is no gain from opportunistically switching between equity and debt.
