Often home buyers hire an inspector to evaluate the roof, plumbing, heating system, and structure of a prospective home. Seldom, however, does the landscape receive similar scrutiny.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the value of those who engage in environmental stewardship of natural areas, we studied volunteer steward 2 ̆ 7 s motivation to participate, their sustainable behaviors and attitudes toward stewardship-related constructs. Specifically, we designed and conducted a survey of volunteers who work as stewards in urban natural areas in Portland, Oregon. We hypothesize that as volunteer frequency increases: participants will be more motivated to participate for environmental reasons, volunteers {{will be more likely to}} feel a strong connection to the stewardship site, participants will be more likely to engage in public pro-environmental behaviors, and their level of environmental literacy will increase. Participants were sampled using a face-to-face survey methodology over the course of late winter and spring of 2012 during 18 different Portland Parks and Recreation sponsored stewardship events. We examined the motivations, attitudes and behaviors of the volunteers, and devised appropriate management implications for those organizing volunteer efforts. We equated a three-tiered typology of environmental literacy, based upon the frequency of volunteer participation, and analyzed our survey data using a principal component analysis, generalized linear models, and a qualitative coding analysis. The most frequent participants showed a higher likelihood of participation in public environmental behaviors, whereas participants at all frequency levels were also likely to participate in private environmental behaviors, such as removing invasive plants in one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yard.</b> Volunteers across all frequencies of participation were motivated to engage in stewardship events by a desire to help the environment.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{containers}} shipped through ports has increased substantially {{in recent years and}} has stimulated research and development of ways to improve storage yard operations. The productivity of a portâ <b>s</b> storage <b>yard</b> depends, in part, on the cranes that are working in storage blocks. Each crane follows a route described primarily by the order to move each container that enters or leaves a block and the position to stack each container in the block. Each container that leaves (enters) the block must be unloaded (loaded) in a limited capacity transfer point before (after) a given time. This thesis is the first to develop Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) to prescribe routes for one and two equal sized Automated Stacking Cranes (ASCs) in a single block working with straddle carriers to load and unload containers from the transfer points. Using real world data, we construct test problems varying both the number of container bays (length) and excess capacity of each block. We find one ASC working alone over four hours requires up to 70 % more time than two ASCs working together to accomplish the same required container movements.

5000|$|During World War I, the {{shipyard}} began constructing submarines, with [...] {{being the first}} ever built by a U. <b>S.</b> navy <b>yard.</b> Meanwhile, the base continued to overhaul and repair surface vessels. Consequently, the workforce grew to nearly 5,000 civilians. It grew to almost 25,000 civilians in World War II when over 70 submarines were constructed at the yard, {{with a record of}} 4 launched in a single day. When the war ended, {{the shipyard}} became the Navy's center for submarine design and development. In 1953, [...] revolutionized submarine design around the world with its teardrop hull and round cross-section. It is now a museum and tourist attraction in Portsmouth. , the first nuclear-powered submarine built at the base, was launched in 1957. The last submarine built here was the , launched in 1969. Today the shipyard provides overhaul, refueling, and modernization work. In the early years of submarine construction, the wood from Lignumvitae tree logs was used for propeller shaft bearings. A small pond, near the Naval Prison, was used to keep the lignumvitae logs submerged in water in order to prevent the wood from cracking. Although the use of wood was discontinued as construction techniques improved, the logs were still there during the construction of USS JACK SSN605 in the period 1963-1967.|$|R
40|$|Although sexual {{harassment}} in the employment context receives considerable attention both in popular culture 21 and in the justice system, 22 a significant number of victims endure {{sexual harassment}} at home, in silence, and without legal recourse. More often than not, such victims share similar characteristics: they are usually poor, often with young children, and frequently nonwhite. Many victims are so poor that they qualify for governmental housing benefits. Furthermore, {{it is not unusual for}} such victims to have recently lived with friends or family members or to have been homeless. Their desperation for housing is usually related to concern not for their own well-being, but rather for their children. More than anything, they want to keep a decent roof over their families 2 ̆ 7 heads. Victims of {{sexual harassment in}} housing are not selected at random. The characteristics they share in common are the same characteristics that make them both attractive and vulnerable to predatory landlords. Because of their poverty, isolation, and desperation, they are more willing to comply and endure than report the harasser or assert their legal rights. Ultimately, they fear the consequences of resisting the harassment-the loss of their current housing, potential blacklisting in the local housing community, and possible termination of governmental housing benefits-more than the harassment itself. In this way, sexual harassment in housing 23 is meaningfully different than other forms of residential harassment, such as racial, disability, or national origin harassment. A neighbor who burns a cross in the lone African-American family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>yard</b> is presumably intending to force that family out of its home. The same result is likely intended when insults and religious epithets are scrawled outside a Jewish family 2 ̆ 7 s house. But the landlord who sexually harasses his tenant is not intending to drive her out; instead, he is attempting to draw her in-to hold her captive, through the use of psychological, economic, or sometimes legal coercion-to satisfy his own desire to control and exploit. The primary federal statute combating discrimination in housing celebrates its fortieth anniversary in 2008. Although the Federal Fair Housing Act (FHA) does not expressly prohibit harassment of existing tenants, its broad terms have been interpreted by various courts, beginning in 1983, to protect occupancy. Since that time, federal doctrine governing claims of post-acquisition harassment has developed piecemeal and inconsistently across the federal circuits, with courts frequently borrowing [...] often without much thoughtful explanation [...] significant theories or legal tests from the Title VII employment context. This process has been made more difficult not simply because of the lack of clear statutory protection in this area, but also because the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has never promulgated final rules articulating the precise contours of harassment claims under the FHA...|$|R

40|$|Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.) can be sorted into red- and {{white-fleshed}} cultivars. The {{flesh of}} Luoyangqing (LYQ, red-fleshed) appears red-orange {{because of a}} high content of carotenoids while the flesh of Baisha (BS, white-fleshed) appears ivory white {{due to a lack}} of carotenoid accumulation. The carotenoid content in the peel and flesh of LYQ was approximately 68 mug g(- 1) and 13 mug g(- 1) fresh weight (FW), respectively, and for BS 19 mug g(- 1) and 0. 27 mug g(- 1) FW. The mRNA levels of 15 carotenogenesis-related genes were analysed during fruit development and ripening. After the <b>breaker</b> stage (<b>S</b> 4), the mRNA levels of phytoene synthase 1 (PSY 1) and chromoplast-specific lycopene beta-cyclase (CYCB) were higher in the peel, and CYCB and beta-carotene hydroxylase (BCH) mRNAs were higher in the flesh of LYQ, compared with BS. Plastid morphogenesis during fruit ripening was also studied. The ultrastructure of plastids in the peel of BS changed less than in LYQ during fruit development. Two different chromoplast shapes were observed in the cells of LYQ peel and flesh at the fully ripe stage. Carotenoids were incorporated in the globules in chromoplasts of LYQ and BS peel but were in a crystalline form in the chromoplasts of LYQ flesh. However, no chromoplast structure was found in the cells of fully ripe BS fruit flesh. The mRNA level of plastid lipid-associated protein (PAP) in the peel and flesh of LYQ was over five times higher than in BS peel and flesh. In conclusion, the lower carotenoid content in BS fruit was associated with the lower mRNA levels of PSY 1, CYCB, and BCH; however, the failure to develop normal chromoplasts in BS flesh is the most convincing explanation for the lack of carotenoid accumulation. The expression of PAP was well correlated with chromoplast numbers and carotenoid accumulation, suggesting its possible role in chromoplast biogenesis or interconversion of loquat fruit...|$|R
