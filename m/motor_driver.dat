The glare was following the motor back to the crest of the Keston hill. He watched the little conveyance receding in that white halo. It had a curious effect, as though it was not moving at all and the halo was. A group of war-blasted Giant elders flashed into gaunt scarred gesticulations and were swallowed again by the night ... Redwood turned to Cossar's dim outline again and clasped his hand. [...] "I have been shut up and kept in ignorance," [...] he said, [...] "for two whole days." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Motor</b> <b>driver</b> and {{electronics}}: Brushless motors {{need some}} electronics to be commutated and control their speed. In early versions the drivers were unreliable and {{this led to}} user dissatisfaction when compared with highly reliable hydraulic thrusters. More recently developments in power electronic technology have made the <b>motor</b> <b>driver</b> more efficient and reliable, cheap and small, to be fitted directly {{to the end of}} the motor. In modern designs the motor controllers are able not only to control the propeller RPM, but also to control the thrust force in applications that need close control on their positioning.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the control device angklung (traditional musical instrument) with a 3 octave by using microcontroller. Each angklung pitch should be shaken to produce intonation. The electric motor {{is used as}} a vibrator mechanism and installed on every pitch angklung. Parameters such as the time duration and the motor speed to needs to be controlled and this require a <b>Motor</b> <b>Drivers.</b> Angklung pitch usually arranged in a Diatonic Scale. In a frame of angklung, there is 7 pitch intonation compiled in one octave, then there are 21 motors needs to be controlled by a microcontroller to control the angklung that has 3 different octaves. If each motor requires 12 volt and 100 mA to move, then 2. 1 A is required for all motor to operate simultaneously without problems. This requires Power Supply which provide 12 volt and 3 A. By using the Serial Parallel Interface (SPI), 21 connections from microcontroller to control each motor can be reduced. Because all <b>motor</b> <b>drivers</b> connected in serial connection, then the latency in <b>motor</b> <b>drivers</b> should be measure. Latency is the amount of time it takes for a system after the system receives the signal till the system is producing other signal out. If the <b>motor</b> <b>drivers</b> produce high latency, the delay produced by the angklung can be heard. The normal human ear can notice latency more than 3 ms...|$|R

Don Henderson, of the FDU, would later acknowledge that {{a large part of}} the FDU's motivation in seeking amalgamation with the Marine <b>Motor</b> <b>Drivers</b> and Coxswains was the vital position of the linesmen, represented by the latter union, in port operations. The linesmen's role in securing moored ships meant they could halt all docking of ships in the event of an industrial dispute.|$|R

50|$|At 1:30pm on 1 April 2011, a Zig Zag Railway {{maintenance}} vehicle (the Hi-Rail), {{collided with a}} two-car Rail Motor on the No 1 Viaduct, Top Road, between Clarence and Top Points stations. The Hi-Rail, with a Driver and Passenger on board, was freewheeling down the hill in reverse in the section from Clarence towards Top Points. The Rail Motor, operated by a Driver, was travelling empty {{in the opposite direction}} from Top Points. The Rail <b>Motor</b> <b>Driver</b> saw the approaching vehicle and applied the brakes. However, the two persons on board the Hi-Rail, facing the opposite direction, did not see the Rail Motor before the collision. The force of the collision compacted the body of the Hi-Rail such that neither cab door would open. The two occupants of the Hi-Rail were injured in the collision and were assisted out of the Hi-Rail and onto the Rail Motor by the Rail <b>Motor</b> <b>Driver</b> who was uninjured. The force of the collision caused a minor misalignment of the track. The investigation established that the collision resulted from the Driver of the Rail Motor and the Driver of the Hi-Rail not being aware that they were travelling towards each other on the same track in the Top Points-Clarence section. This lack of situational awareness resulted from procedural errors. The Rail <b>Motor</b> <b>Driver</b> departed Top Points without communicating his intention to his Guard or the Hi-Rail crew, and the Rail Motor Guard exceeded his authority by authorising the Hi-Rail to leave a worksite and proceed to Top Points. A number of other factors were found to have contributed to the collision, particularly a lack of radio communications and operational safeworking errors. Other safety issues identified during the investigation included delayed notification of the accident; poor maintenance of Train Register Books; passengers travelling in the Rail Motor driver's cab; Rail Motor Driver's fatigue; and excess speed of the Hi-Rail.|$|E
