Since <b>media</b> forms are part of the cultural “waters ” in which we “swim, ” it is very difficult for literate persons to objectively analyze the connections and divergences between oral and literate modes. True, they are both “cognate concepts in the field of verbal communication” 3; however, the shift from oral to <b>literate</b> forms of <b>media</b> was not merely stylistic. “It embodied a change in the psychological preconditions of the act and process of communication.

However, the determination of how individuals of the information community are <b>media</b> and television <b>literate</b> is another issue that {{is as important as}} the above-mentioned one. Together with this, the starting points also can be determined in order to fix some applications carried out by individuals regarding the media and television literacy in terms of these skills. Therefore, it can be outlined that the development of scales the validity and reliability of which are tested is a must in order to determine the levels of individuals of information community in terms of media and television literacy. Within this framework, a scale determining the levels of individuals of information community in terms of media and television literacy is a must. Therefore in order to answer this need in the related literature, this study focuses on a reliability and validity scale in media and television literacy. The purpose of this study is to develop a scale with the aim of determining the levels of media and television literacy of pre-service teachers. The study group of this study consists of 294 female and 215 male students with the total 509 students. In order to detect the validity of the inventory; exploratory factor analyses and item discrimination power were calculated.

[...] <b>Media</b> <b>literate</b> {{people should be}} able to skillfully create and produce media messages, both to show understanding of the specific qualities of each medium, as well as to create independent media and participate as active citizens. Media literacy can be seen as contributing to an expanded conceptualization of literacy, treating mass media, popular culture and digital media as new types of 'texts' that require analysis and evaluation. By transforming the process of media consumption into an active and critical process, people gain greater awareness of the potential for misrepresentation and manipulation (especially through commercials and public relations techniques), and understand the role of mass media and participatory media in constructing views of reality.|$|E

Renee Hobbs, professor of Communication and Media at the University of Rhode Island, developed a list of skills that demonstrate digital and media literacy competence. Digital and media literacy involves knowing how to retrieve, distribute, and understand information found in digital environments, such as the internet. Digital and media literacy includes the ability to examine and comprehend the meaning of messages, judging credibility, and assessing {{the quality of the}} digital work. The individual is capable of analyzing digital and media messages by recognizing the author's perspective and overall purpose. A digital and <b>media</b> <b>literate</b> individual has the aptitude to create diverse forms of digital content and possesses technology skills to create digital content. The individual becomes a socially responsible member of their community by spreading awareness and helping others find digital solutions at home, work, or on a national platform.|$|E
5000|$|Sociological images {{was founded}} in 2007 by {{sociology}} professor Lisa Wade (Occidental College) and hosted at Blogspot to share ideas and teaching resources with other faculty teaching about sociology. Six professors were invited {{to serve as the}} foundational bloggers. Early posts included little text because it was assumed the audience would be academics and thus understand the context of the material. After a few months, Wade and Gwen Sharp (Nevada State College) by dint of being the main content producers took over the blog. While the writers did not originally envision a non-academic audience, the posts started to be shared amongst a large non-academic community, particularly through Facebook and Twitter in the later years of the blog. Wade and Sharp were very surprised to see their posts circulate beyond academics and, initially, a little unsettled to have non-academics commenting. However, seeing their audience grow, they were excited and reimagined the site as a blog devoted to public sociology. In 2008, the editors of Contexts, a magazine published by the American Sociological Association, asked Wade and Sharp if they would be interested in integrating their blog into the website of the magazine and they agreed. In 2010, the editors of the magazine retired but moved the website's content to The Society Pages along with Sociological Images. As Wade and Sharp put it in their history of the blog, [...] "with the help of the technical staff at Contexts and the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Sociological Images became increasingly professional, functional, and multidimensional". Wade and Sharp have reflected {{that as a result of}} writing and publishing the blog they have become more <b>media</b> <b>literate.</b> For example, they no longer highlight CafePress tshirts, since anyone can put any slogan on one; instead, they choose to highlight influential images.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{call for}} a scientifically literate citizenry necessitates {{individuals}} {{who are able to}} understand and make decisions regarding socioscientific issues. Socioscientific issues are social dilemmas with no definite solutions that have captured the attention of media sources nationally and internationally. This implies that scientifically literate individuals also need to be <b>media</b> <b>literate</b> and able to critically analyze socioscientific information presented in the media. Because teachers are considered the most influential factor in promoting student achievement and literacy, it is imperative that teachers be scientifically and <b>media</b> <b>literate</b> as well. Goals: The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the types of media and criteria that preservice science teachers use to select and evaluate information pertaining to socioscientific issues presented in multimedia texts intended for use with k- 12 students. Research Methods: Exploratory study using course artifacts generated by 40 middle childhood science preservice teachers. Data sources were analyzed for frequencies and emergent patterns. Results: Preservice teachers selected a variety of multimedia resources to teach socioscientific issues. They reexamined the selected multimedia resources with readability criteria for use with middle childhood students. The preservice teachers suggested the addition of four new criteria to the readability checklist to make it science specific. These four criteria provide a basis for informal reasoning processes...|$|E

40|$|Alcohol {{advertising}} {{appeals to}} young people through humor, animation, bright colors and music; it tends to reinforce the link between drinking and socialization and being accepted by peers, which are important concerns for adolescents. Nonetheless, studies suggest that even a single media literacy intervention can help children and adolescents understand the persuasive appeals of tobacco and alcohol advertising messages {{and make a difference}} in their intention to use tobacco and alcohol, at least in the short-term. However, despite the accumulating research on impacts of alcohol advertising content on youth and the several studies that have explored media literacy intervention indifferent context, with numerous findings focusing on the influence of media literacy on decision making towards extant behaviors among adolescents, there was a need to quantitatively model within a Nigerian context if media literacy significantly alters adolescents drinking expectancies and which component of media literacy significantly alters these drinking expectancies. Hence, this study employing a Solomon-four experimental research design {{within the context of the}} theory of planned behavior and the media literacy framework examined the alcohol expectancies of <b>media</b> <b>literate</b> and illiterate adolescents. Using a sample size of 860 adolescents in Lagos State, the researcher hypothesized that there is no significant difference between alcohol expectancies of <b>media</b> <b>literate</b> and illiterate adolescents towards alcohol and alcohol consumption. Secondly, that there is no significant difference in the level of alteration caused by the various components of media literacy among media literates of same and different ages. The findings of the study revealed the component of media literacy framework that significantly alters adolescents’ drinking expectancies as well as the strength and direction of each media literacy component as they relate with adolescents drinking expectancies.

40|$|A <b>media</b> <b>literate</b> citizenry is at {{the core}} of vibrant {{democracy}} in civil society. However, local issues are frequently neglected in mass media, de-legitimizing the existence of real democracy. Alternative media mediate this discrepancy in providing access to communication venues through outreach and teach strategies. Many segments of civil society are searching for opportunities to voice their opinions through alternative media. Studies of citizen-produced media indicate that there are links between media use and learning, and that these links are embedded in socially interactive projects. This paper examines two examples of alternative media that use outreach and teach approaches in the United States: Free Speech TV and Indymedia. Our discussion explores the praxis of these media, their contribution to the teaching and learning of civil society and healthy democracy, and the cultural-political intersections of alternative media in formal and informal education...|$|E
