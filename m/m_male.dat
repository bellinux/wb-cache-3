40|$|In Parablennius parvicornis, small {{reproductive}} {{males with}} relatively low expression of secondary sexual characters (M morphotype) parasite on the parental investment {{of the larger}} nest-holder males which have fully developed secondary sexual characters (M 1 morphotype). In comparison with <b>M</b> 1 <b>males,</b> <b>M</b> <b>males</b> have relatively low levels of androgens while having high blood cell percentages of lymphocytes and antigen responsiveness. Here we test the hypothesis that androgens are a causal factor for these differences in immunocompetence between morphotypes. After drawing an initial blood sample, males received a silastic implant containing either oil only (C), or oil with testosterone (T) or 11 -ketotestosterone (KT). Males were re-caught 2 weeks later for drawing of the final blood sample. KT but not T induced the development of secondary sexual characters in <b>M</b> <b>males.</b> <b>M</b> <b>males</b> treated with KT showed lower swimming activity than the males treated with T or C implants, suggesting that KT also mediates behavioral changes in <b>M</b> <b>males.</b> As expected, blood cell percentages of lymphocytes, but not of granulocytes, were higher in <b>M</b> <b>males</b> than in <b>M</b> 1 <b>males.</b> Overall, lymphocyte percentages increased in the C group {{which might have been}} a response to the surgery/treatment. In concordance with the hypothesis, lymphocyte percentages were suppressed in males treated with T in comparison with controls. However, no significant change was found in KT-treated males.

40|$|In haplodiploid organisms {{including}} the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae), both unmated and mated females can produce male offspring. A previous {{study reported that}} males produced by unmated females (UM males) find pre-reproductive females more quickly than males produced by mated females (<b>M</b> <b>males)</b> in T. urticae. However, it remains unclear what factors cause the difference. We investigated effects of maternal mating status on mate-searching behaviour of their sons by changing the sons’ developmental environment. In T. urticae, the primary sex ratio of mated-female colonies is female-biased. For both UM and <b>M</b> <b>males,</b> half of individuals were reared with males to imitate unmated-female colonies, whereas the rest were reared with females to imitate mated-female colonies. In UM males, individuals that had developed with males found pre-reproductive females more quickly than those that had developed with females. However, such a difference was not observed in <b>M</b> <b>males.</b> This indicates that behavioural response to the developmental environment differs between UM and <b>M</b> <b>males.</b> It means that the behavioural plasticity depends on maternal mating status. When males were individually reared, however, {{there was no significant}} difference in the mate-searching behaviour between UM and <b>M</b> <b>males,</b> indicating that maternal mating status does not independently affect their sons’ mate-searching behaviour. This study showed that male mate-searching behaviour is changed by their developmental environment and maternal mating status. This behavioural plasticity depending on maternal mating status is the first reported in haplodiploid organisms. </p...|$|R
