25|$|Contemporary romance, {{which is}} set after World War II, is often what people <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> they refer to a romance novel. Contemporary romance novels—the largest subgenre—are set in {{the time when they}} are written, and usually reflect the mores of that time. Heroines in {{contemporary}} romances prior to 1970 usually quit working when they marry or have children—while heroines after 1970 usually have, and keep, a career. As contemporary romance novels have grown to contain more complex plotting and more realistic characters, the line between this subgenre and the genre of women's fiction has blurred.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the clearest}} example to {{illustrate}} {{the importance of the}} difference between original intent and original understanding is to use the Twenty-seventh Amendment. The Twenty-seventh Amendment was proposed as part of the Bill of Rights in 1791, but failed to be ratified by the required number of states for two centuries, eventually being ratified in 1992. An original intent inquiry might ask what the framers understood the amendment to <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> it was written, though some would argue that it was the intent of the latter-day ratifiers that is important. An original-meaning inquiry would ask what the plain, public meaning of the text was in 1992 when it was eventually ratified.|$|E
25|$|Davidson {{points out}} that beliefs and {{meanings}} are inseparable. A person holds a sentence true {{based on what he}} believes and what he takes the sentence to mean. If the interpreter knew what a person believed when that person held a sentence to be true, the meaning of the sentence could then be inferred. Vice versa, if the interpreter knew what a person took a sentence to <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> that person held it to be true, the belief of the speaker could be inferred. So Davidson doesn't allow the interpreter to have access to beliefs as evidence, since the interpreter would then be begging the question. Instead, Davidson allows that the interpreter can reasonably ascertain when a speaker holds a sentence true, without knowing anything about a particular belief or meaning. That will then allow the interpreter to construct hypotheses relating a speaker and an utterance to a particular state of affairs at a particular time.|$|E

500|$|Today, it is {{generally}} accepted that Sappho's poetry portrays homoerotic feelings: as Sandra Boehringer puts it, her works [...] "clearly celebrate eros between women". Toward {{the end of the}} twentieth century, though, some scholars have begun to reject the question of whether or not Sappho was a lesbian – Glenn Most wrote that Sappho herself [...] "would have had no idea what people <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> they call her nowadays a homosexual", André Lardinois stated that it is [...] "nonsensical" [...] to ask whether Sappho was a lesbian, and Page duBois calls the question a [...] "particularly obfuscating debate".|$|E
500|$|The 808's sounds do not {{resemble}} real percussion, {{and have}} been described as [...] "clicky and hypnotic", [...] "robotic", [...] "toy-like", [...] "spacey" [...] and [...] "futuristic". Fact described them as a combination of [...] "synth tones and white noise... more akin to bursts coming from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop [...] a proper rhythm section." [...] The machine is noted for its powerful bass drum sound, built from a combination of a bridged T-network sine oscillator, a low-pass filter, and a voltage-controlled amplifier. The bass drum decay control allows the user to lengthen the sound, creating uniquely low frequencies that flatten slightly over long periods, possibly not by design. The New Yorker wrote: [...] "Less a product of engineering than a force of nature, this bass-rolling subsonic boom has come to be what people <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> they refer to 'an 808'." ...|$|E

500|$|Duerr {{provides}} additional ethnographic examples {{showing how}} societal rules were reversed at special {{times of the}} year. In shamanic terms, societies which espouse an [...] "archaic mentality" [...] understand who they are by understanding who they are not; according to Duerr, modern societies fail to understand this concept. [...] Datura, a plant that contains toxic hallucinogens is discussed. [...] The plant was introduced to Europe in the early modern period. [...] Among the Huichol people of central Mexico, shamans have told anthropologists that Datura is used by malevolent witches. Duerr makes note of the anthropologists who have undertaken shamanic experiences with the people they are studying, such as Barbara Myerhoff and Carlos Castenada, but argues that such ethnographers have failed to truly understand what shamans <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> they describe their experiences as [...] "flying". In Duerr's view, shamans learn to evaporate their [...] "ego boundaries", thereby experiencing themselves in a different way; it is this feeling that {{can be described as}} shamanic flying. Duerr ties these shamanic practices into the werewolves of early modern Europe, arguing that these werewolves did not physically transform into wolves, but that they embraced their [...] "wolf nature" [...] by crossing over the boundary from [...] "civilisation" [...] to [...] "wilderness".|$|E
500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I <b>mean,</b> <b>when</b> you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E
