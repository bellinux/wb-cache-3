50|$|For cathode {{materials}} {{a number}} of different compounds have been researched for suitability, including those used in magnesium primary batteries. New cathode materials investigated or proposed include zirconium disulfide, cobalt(II,III) oxide, tungsten selenide, vanadium pentoxide and vanadate based cathodes. Cobalt based spinels showed inferior kinetics to insertion compared to their behaviour with lithium. In 2000 the chevrel phase form of Mo6S8 was shown to have good suitability as a cathode, enduring 2000 cycles at 100% discharge with a 15% loss; drawbacks were poor low temperature performance (reduced Mg mobility, compensated by substituting Selenium), as well as a low voltage, c. 1.2V, and low energy density (110mAh/g). A molybdenum disulfide cathode showed improved voltage and energy density, 1.8V and 170mAh/g. Transition metal sulfies are considered promising candidates for magnesium ion battery cathodes. A hybrid <b>magnesium</b> <b>cell</b> using a mixed magnesium/sodium electrolyte with sodium insertion into a nanocrystalline iron(II) disulfide cathode was reported in 2015.|$|E

The work is based on compositional and design technology for a ceramic anode developed in the former Central Research Inorganic Laboratory.

The testing goal was to demonstrate six anodes surviving a 30 day test lifetime with acceptable wear rates and electrical performance in a laboratory scale <b>magnesium</b> <b>cell</b> test. State of the art slip casting techniques were used and advanced in the pursuit of a virtually flaw free ceramic anode shell. Novel core materials were also invented to allow for the complete, crack free fabrication of the laboratory scale anode.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of Methanosarcina mazei {{was controlled}} by magnesium, calcium, and substrate concentrations and by inoculum size; these factors allowed manipulation of the morphology and interconversions between pseudosarcinal aggregates and individual, coccoid cells. M. mazei grew as aggregates in medium with a low concentration of catabolic substrate (either 50 mM acetate, 50 mM methanol, or 10 mM trimethylamine) unless Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + concentrations were high. Growth in medium high in Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and substrate (i. e., 150 mM acetate, 150 mM methanol, or 40 mM trimethylamine) converted pseudosarcinal aggregates to individual cocci. In such media, aggregates separated into individual cells which continued to grow exclusively as single cells during subsequent transfers.
