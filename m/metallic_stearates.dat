40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research continues the earlier researches on wear friction and lubrication and its application to the powder metallurgy industries. A detailed study of the parameters involved in wear and friction has been made by using the "Pin and Disc" machine with cross cylinders technique. One iron powder was chosen and compacted over a range of densities {{with a series of}} <b>metallic</b> <b>stearates</b> as admixed lubricants for the purpose of examinations. These compacts were used as the "pins" for the wear and friction apparatus, the "disc" was made from high carbon high chromium steel {{which is one of the}} steels normally used in punches and dies in the powder metallurgy industries. The wear behaviour of these compacts was studied in relation to the following parameters: applied load between compact (or pin) and disc, sliding speed, travelled distance, density and hardness of compact. These were examined for a range of stearate lubricants and the wear rates determined, these data were then related to the possible industrial life for punches and dies in powder metallurgy presses. Besides wear rate, friction forces between the compact (or pin) and disc were measured and these forces of friction were translated into coefficients of friction for each type of lubricant. The thesis presents the results of these investigations with a survey of current theories on wear and friction of metallic systems relevant to powder metallurgy. Conclusions have been drawn and suggestions made on the most useful solid lubricant necessary in the pressing of metallic powders to reduce wear and friction in production presses. Calculations have been carried out using the data collected to estimate the possible press tool wear and accordingly a possible tool life was determined for pressing with each type of tearate lubricant. The overall conclusion was that zinc stearate is the best solid lubricant in the five <b>metallic</b> <b>stearates</b> (Al, Na, Mg, Ca and Zn) for use in iron powder compaction...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{infusion}} tubing {{and blood}} storage devices (tubing, blood and platelets bags) made of plasticized PVC {{were analyzed by}} spectroscopic, chromatographic and microscopic techniques {{in order to identify}} and quantify the additives added to the polymer (lubricants, thermal stabilizers, plasticizers) and to put into evidence their blooming onto the surface of the devices. For all the samples, deposits were observed on the surface but with different kinds of morphologies. Ethylene bis amide lubricant and <b>metallic</b> <b>stearate</b> stabilizers were implicated in the formation of these layers. In contact with aqueous media, these insoluble deposits were damaged, suggesting a possible particulate contamination of the infused solutions...|$|R
40|$|A thin {{potassium}} stearate (KSt) film {{combined with an}} optimized ZnO film was introduced to improve the fill factor (FF) of highly efficient inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs). Atomic force microscopy and contact angle measurements were used {{to show that the}} introduction of KSt did not change the morphology of interlayer. On the contrary, it is beneficial for the spread of the active layer on the interlayer. The origin of enhanced FF was systematically studied by the ideal current-voltage model for a single heterojunction solar cell and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. On the basis of the data analysis, the reduced charge recombination loss was responsible for this improved FF. At last, when KSt was replaced by sodium stearate (NaSt), the similar experiment phenomenon was observed. This indicates that inserting a <b>metallic</b> <b>stearate</b> modified layer is a promising strategy to enhance inverted PSCs performance. Published by AIP Publishing...|$|R
