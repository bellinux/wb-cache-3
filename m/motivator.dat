40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to {{investigation}} of personnel motivation to creativity in modern organizations. It is proposed to differentiate two groups of intrinsic motives. Process-oriented motives are launched in creative process per se, whereas result-oriented motives are associated with perceived positive consequences from participation in creative process. Granted by organization external <b>motivators</b> exert selective effect either on process-oriented motives or result-oriented motives. Supporting external <b>motivators</b> are directed onto forming favorable conditions for creative process and enhance process-oriented intrinsic motives. Rewarding external <b>motivators</b> are directed onto financial, status and emotional recognition of reached results and enhance result-oriented motives. General principles for building effective motivation systems in modern organizations are established as follows: relative autonomy of process-oriented and result-oriented motives, priority of process-oriented motives, directional action of external <b>motivators,</b> balance between external <b>motivators,</b> synergy of external <b>motivators</b> and individual sensitivity to external <b>motivators.</b> ?????? ????????? ???????????? ????????? ? ?????????-????????????? ????????????. ???????????? ? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ???????? ??? ?????? ???????: ??????????, ??????? ????? ?????? ? ????? ?????????? ????????, ? ??????????????, ????????? ? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????????? ?? ??????? ? ?????????? ????????. ??????????????, ??? ??????? ??????????, ??????? ????????????? ???????????, ????????? ????????? ??? ?? ??????????, ??? ?? ?????????????? ??????. ?????????????? ??????? ?????????? ?????????? ?? ???????? ??????? ??? ??????????? ???????? ? ???????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????. ???????????? ??????? ?????????? ?????????? ?? ????????????, ????????? ? ????????????? ????????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ???????? ?????????????? ?????????? ???????. ??????????? ???????? ???????????????? ??????? ????????? ? ?????????-????????????? ????????????: ????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ???????, ?????????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????, ????????????? ????????, ?????????????????? ? ??????????????? ??????? ???????????, ?????????????? ???????????????? ? ?? ????????...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: This {{research}} {{addresses a}} primary issue that involves motivating academics to share knowledge. Adapting {{the theory of}} reasoned action, this study examines the role of motivation that consists of intrinsic <b>motivators</b> (commitment; enjoyment in helping others) and extrinsic <b>motivators</b> (reputation; organizational rewards) to determine and explain the behaviour of Malaysian academics in sharing knowledge. Method: A self-administered questionnaire was distributed using a non-probability sampling technique. A total of 373 completed responses were collected with a total response rate of 38. 2 %. Analysis: The partial least squares {{analysis was used to}} analyse the data. Results: The results indicated that all five of the hypotheses were supported. Analysis of data from the five higher learning institutions in Malaysia found that commitment and enjoyment in helping others (i. e., intrinsic <b>motivators)</b> and reputation and organizational rewards (i. e., extrinsic <b>motivators)</b> have a positive and significant relationship with attitude towards knowledge-sharing. In addition, the findings revealed that intrinsic <b>motivators</b> are more influential than extrinsic <b>motivators.</b> This suggests that academics are influenced more by intrinsic <b>motivators</b> than by extrinsic <b>motivators.</b> Conclusions: The findings provided an indication of the determinants in enhancing knowledge-sharing intention among academics in higher education institutions through extrinsic and intrinsic <b>motivators...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine if there is any relationship between employee creativity and job-related <b>motivators,</b> using a case study of hotel employees in Hong Kong. From a sample of 983 employees, canonical correlation indicated there is a relationship between creativity and job-related <b>motivators.</b> Furthermore, the risk-taking dimension under creativity was found to be more correlated to the intrinsic job-related <b>motivators.</b> Intrinsic job-related <b>motivators</b> which include opportunity for advancement and development, loyalty to employees, appreciation and praise of work done, feelings of being involved, sympathetic help with personal problems and interesting work, are found to encourage the hotel employees' risk-taking behavior.

5|$|Scholars {{have often}} {{connected}} {{the notion of}} karma to the determinism in the caste system in India. Just like {{in the case of}} karma, some scholars believe that a belief in merit can cause social differences to stay unchanged. This would be the case when the poor, who cannot make much merit, resign to their fate. Other scholars point out that merit can be used to improve social status in the present, {{as in the case of}} someone ordaining as a monk for a few years. And vice versa, if someone's social status quickly deteriorates, for example, due to quick changes in the bureaucratic structure, these changes might be justified in Buddhist societies because someone's store of merit is believed to have run out. Someone's position in society, even in the cosmos, is always subject to the impermanent workings of merit and demerit. In traditional Buddhist societies, quick changes in position, status, or roles are therefore considered part of life, and this insecurity is a <b>motivator</b> in trying to improve the situation through merit-making. Findly points out that in Buddhist ideals of merit-making, the earned value gained by doing good deeds is more important than the assigned value gained by social status at birth.|$|E

40|$|Large {{incentive}} competitions {{are becoming}} increasingly popular amongst policymakers and philanthropists as a mission-orientated tool for inducing innovation, particularly in areas of national priority where market incentives and conventional tools such as patents and procurements tend not to be sufficient. Using inducement mechanisms (<b>motivators)</b> such as a large financial reward, demanding deliverables, and technical support, incentive competitions seek to motivate innovators to exert effort and develop creative solutions to pre-defined problems. According to the literature, these <b>motivators</b> can be powerful mechanisms for influencing effort and creativity but their effectiveness very much depends on the combination of <b>motivators</b> used and conditions under which they are executed. There is {{a serious lack of}} empirical evidence on the <b>motivators</b> and conditions of large incentive competitions and their effectiveness to influence behaviour and outcomes. Therefore, we cannot fully appreciate the role of large incentive competitions in the innovation policy tool kit.

The impact of financial and nonfinancial <b>motivators</b> on employee development (measured in terms of knowledge, skills and abilities) has been tested. Factor analysis was used for identifying the different sets of <b>motivators,</b> and multiple regressions for testing the relationship between <b>motivators</b> and its impact on employee development. The results of factor analysis identified 5 sets of <b>motivators</b> viz. Social, Personal, Financial, Ego and Security. The relation between employees’ knowledge and skills to the <b>motivators</b> were found to be significant with a few exceptions.

This approach is favoured because academic literature covering the <b>motivators</b> and inhibitors of the development and deployment of IoT applications integrally is non-existent, and the possible range of results must be defined first. Two main working steps were taken to answer the RQs. First, the literature was reviewed to collect a broad spectrum of possible <b>motivators</b> and inhibitors of IoT application development and deployment and to develop a conceptual model which allows us to cover the inhibitors and <b>motivators</b> exhaustively. Second, based on the first step, a survey was designed and used to collect quantitative data for validating and measuring the relevance of the identified <b>motivators</b> and inhibitors and to test the formulated hypotheses.|$|R

Satisfiers are all intrinsic <b>motivators</b> that {{are directly related}} to rewards attainable from work performance and even the nature of the work itself. [...] Dissatisfiers are extrinsic <b>motivators</b> based on the work environment, and include a company’s policies and administration such as supervision, peers, working conditions, and salary. [...] Herzberg believed providing for hygiene and maintenance needs could prevent dissatisfaction but not contribute to satisfaction. [...] Herzberg also believed that satisfiers hold the greatest potential for increased work performance. [...] Work-life programs are a form of satisfier that recognizes the employee’s life outside of work which, in turn, helps motivate the employee.|$|R
