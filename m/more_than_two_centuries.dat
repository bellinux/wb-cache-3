5|$|Following <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> of Arab rule, Armenia gained {{independence}} {{under the}} leadership of the Bagratid (Bagratuni) dynasty around 885. King Ashot III made Ani capital in 961, after which the city emerged as a prosperous urban center with 100,000 residents at its height. The construction of the cathedral began in 989. The architect Trdat was commissioned by Bagratid King Smbat II to build a cathedral in the new capital of the Armenian kingdom. The construction was halted when Smbat died in 989, according to an inscription on the south wall. Meanwhile, Trdat was hired to direct the repairs of the dome of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, which had collapsed in an earthquake. Trdat returned from Constantinople in 993. The construction was continued and completed by Queen Katranide (Katramide), the wife of King Gagik I, Smbat's brother and successor. It was completed either in 1001 or 1010. According to Christina Maranci the generally accepted date of completion is 1001, but it may have extended until 1010. The contradiction is based on the reading of the inscription of the cathedral's northern wall. The cathedral served as the seat of the catholicos, the head of the Armenian Apostolic Church from its foundation in 1001 until the mid-11th century (1046 or 1051). Thus, for around half a century Ani was both the religious and secular center of Armenia.|$|E
40|$|Background: During {{the last}} decade or so the century old bespoke tailors on Savile Row have become the epitome of luxury brands as far as {{menswear}} is concerned. At the same time, the different establishments on Savile Row have started to modernise themselves through various means to better fit into today’s fast paced retail-market. Aims of the research: The purpose of this research is to discover what factors have played part in keeping the founders of Savile Row, Henry Poole & Co., modern and relevant throughout the years. Methods: This research was conducted as a qualitative single case, case study. The data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with upper management and other available published sources and then analysed with the help of former research in relevant areas. Results: It was found that the brand of Henry Poole & Co. stayed true to their origins as a bespoke tailor and that modernising is something that has not been forced upon the company and brand but should more be seen as a continuous process where each new generation bring something new to the company. The company had adapted modern ways of communication such as social media and a responsive website and also incorporated step down line extensions, where they sell ready-to-wear and made-to-measure garments in China and Japan. This is a way to develop their brand into other segments but they still kept their original brand vision intact as being a pure bespoke tailor located on Savile Row and kept their different business operations on a distance. Contributions: This thesis has opened up doors to an area that has not had much interest from the academic world. It hopefully gives way for new research ideas, but it has also highlighted management tools and best practices that has contributed to the success of a <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>century</b> old company...|$|R

Along {{with the growth of}} {{literacy}} popularity and the rise of modern writers, whose origins are no more of privileged class, their houses start to be pilgrimage destinations and places of interest. Most writers’ houses are protected for their connections with the writers rather than their architectural significance. Hence it is common to see that the presentation of the house emphasises this aspect <b>more</b> <b>than</b> other, although in some cases the writer’s history with the house is relatively short. Through the making of writers’ houses, we see how people’s expectation towards a place is affected by their perception of favoured history. This research aims to discover/ reflect on what the expectation towards a writer’s house has been made of, and how the expectation has led to spatial operations on the house in different times.

40|$|Abstract: A strong {{association}} between dystonia and tremor {{has been known}} for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a <b>century.</b> <b>Two</b> forms of tremor in dystonia are currently recognized: 1) dystonic tremor, which is tremor produced by dystonic muscle contraction and 2) tremor associated with dystonia, which is tremor in a body part that is not dystonic, but there is dystonia elsewhere. Both forms of tremor in dystonia frequently resemble essential tremor or another pure tremor syndrome (e. g., isolated head and voice tremors and task-specific writing tremor), and relationships among these tremor disorders have long been debated. Misdiagnosis is common because mild dystonia is frequently overlooked in patients with tremor. It is now clear that essential tremor is a syndrome, not a specific disease, and the use of essential tremor as a specific clinical diagnosis is arguably an impediment to elucidating this and other pure tremor syndromes and their relationship to dystonia. A new classification, primary tremor, is proposed and would be used for any disorder in which tremor is the sole or principal abnormality with no identifiable etiology other than possible genetic inheritance. This classification scheme would facilitate tremor research by moving the focus from the narrow question “Is it essential tremor? ” to a broader consideration of what genetic and environmental factors cause primary tremor disorders, and how do they relate to dystonia and other neurological disorders...|$|R

I am using the term "deaf " to mean persons with a prelingual PTA threshold of 90 dB or more. In 1888 Alexander Graham Bell (Gordon, 1892) lamented the fact that of the then-existing three broad varieties of methods of instruction-the oral, the manual (fingerspelling), and the sign methods-each aimed primarily at remedying only one of the misfortunes of the congenitally deaf child. These he identified as lack of speech, lack of knowledge of written language, and lack of mental development which comes from intercourse with others. He affirmed the effectiveness of each of the approaches in remedying one of these misfortunes, but recommended taking what he called the resultant path, striving to solve all three problems through combinations of tools used within a single program. Today the situation remains the same. Oral educators are now further divided into advocates of aural/oral, auditory-verbal, and cochlear-implant camps. Those who use the slogan Total Communication give lip service to speech and hearing, and include fingerspelling and the teaching of written language. The tragedy is that the results have not changed significantly in the last century. The fact that both Total Communication and aural/oral methods have failed to produce acceptable levels o...|$|R

40|$|In this presentation, I {{discuss how}} {{language}} maintenance was historically possible {{in spite of}} forced migration for speakers of an under-documented language called Kizigua. The Wazigua people who speak this language trace their origins to the Northeastern Coast of Tanzania but were brought northward to Somalia to work as slaves in the 19 th Century. Upon escape, the Wazigua created fugitive slave communities that have been continuously present in Southern Somalia for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a <b>century.</b> <b>Two</b> major factors will be argued to have contributed towards language maintenance: 1) coincidental contact with Bantu speakers in Southern Somalia and 2) social distance from ethnic Somalis. Research {{on the history of}} the region along with historical sources documenting the language in the 19 th Century will be brought together with more recent sources and interviews with present-day speakers of the language. Both linguistic and socio-historical evidence will be presented. A major focus will be on tracing the historical development of a set of rare sounds described by linguists as “retroflex” sounds. It will be shown that their development provides evidence for these two factors. Although human migration has accelerated to unprecedented levels in an era of globalization, migration itself is nothing new in human history nor is language change due to migration. Yet, the similarities and differences between historical and modern-day situations are not often explored. This presentation, thus, contributes to language and migration research by illustrating a historical example of language maintenance in a pre-colonial setting. The presentation will conclude with a brief discussion of the modern-day situation of the language and how it contrasts with the 19 th Century situation. The modern-day situation involves a second forced migration of the community as a result of the Somali Civil War, which began in the 1990 ’s...|$|R
