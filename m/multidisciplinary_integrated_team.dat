Few empirical studies to date have examined {{the experiences of the}} <b>integrated</b> <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>teams</b> involved in reablement. Accordingly, the aim {{of this study was to}} explore and describe how an <b>integrated</b> <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>team</b> in Norway experienced participation in reablement. Methods: An <b>integrated</b> <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>team</b> consisting of health care professionals with a bachelor’s degree (including a physiotherapist, a social educator, occupational therapists, and nurses) and home-based care personnel without a bachelor’s degree (auxiliary nurses and nursing assistants) participated in focus group discussions. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the resulting data. Results: Three main themes emerged from the participants’ experiences with participating in reablement, including “the older adult’s goals are crucial”, “a different way of thinking and acting – a shift in work culture”, and “a better framework for cooperation and application of professional expertise and judgment”. The <b>integrated</b> <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>team</b> and the older adults collaborated and worked in the same direction to achieve the person’s valued goals. The team supported the older adults in performing activities themselves rather than completing tasks for them. To facilitate cooperation and application of professional expertise and judgment, common meeting times and meeting places for communication and supervision were necessary. Conclusion: Structural factors that promote <b>integrated</b> <b>multidisciplinary</b> professional decisions include providing common meeting times and meeting places as well as sufficient time to apply professional knowledge when supervising and supporting older persons in everyday activities. These findings have implications for practice and suggest future directions for improving health care services. The shift in work culture from static to dynamic service is time consuming and requires politicians, community leaders, and health care systems to allocate the necessary time to support this approach to thinking and working.

40|$|Although Code of Maryland policy {{mandates}} <b>multidisciplinary,</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>teams</b> {{for residential}} service provider organizations (RPOs) for an intellectual/developmental disabilities (IDD) population, alignment criteria {{to identify and}} evaluate the functional characteristics of such teams do not exist. This ambiguity has resulted in potential conflict in the goals of service delivery, as well as misaligned quality assessment and policy development criteria. The intent of this general qualitative study was to use complex adaptive systems theory and Vitkiene 2 ̆ 7 s work on corporate ethos {{to determine whether the}} services provided by a single RPO were consistent and aligned with the regulatory mandate set by the state. Data were acquired from the Maryland Office of Health Care Quality, for the years 2010 - 2015 that consisted of compliance inspections, reports, citations, as well as responses and corrective actions made by the IDD-RPO. Data were deductively coded according to Vitkiene 2 ̆ 7 s 3 ethos principles: economy (profit), procedure (task completion), and beneficence (customer service) and then subjected to a content analysis procedure. The study affirmed the lack of alignment criteria within the RPO by demonstrating ambiguity in how services were measured. Findings identified beneficence as most likely to be associated with a multidisciplinary team. Positive social change implications stem from recommendations to repurpose public health compliance data to address issues of misalignment in institutional service delivery; these findings may also be used by policy makers to focus on ethos as a means to focus on realigning policy objectives, the regulatory environment, and the work done at the RPO level to encourage better quality of life for individuals diagnosed with IDD...|$|R

This study aims to review the effectiveness of interventions targeting the elderly population in reducing ED utilisation. Methods Major biomedical databases were searched for relevant studies. Qualitative approach was applied to derive common themes in the myriad interventions and to critically assess the variations influencing interventions’ effectiveness. Quality of studies was appraised using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPPHP) tool. Results 36 studies were included. Nine of 16 community-based interventions reported significant reductions in ED utilisation. Five of 20 hospital-based interventions proved effective while another four demonstrated failure. Seven key elements were identified. Ten of 14 interventions associated with significant reduction on ED use integrated {{at least three of}} the seven elements. All four interventions with significant negative results lacked five or more of the seven elements. Some key elements including <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>team,</b> <b>integrated</b> primary care and social care often existed in effective interventions, while were absent in all significantly ineffective ones. Conclusions The investigated interventions have mixed effectiveness. Our findings suggest the hospital-based interventions have relatively poorer effects, and should be better connected to the community-based strategies. Interventions seem to achieve the most success with integration of multi-layered elements, especially when incorporating key elements such as a nurse-led <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>team,</b> <b>integrated</b> social care, and strong linkages to the longer-term primary and community care.

40|$|Background: Interventions {{to prevent}} readmissions of {{patients}} {{at highest risk}} have not been rigorously evaluated. We conducted a randomised controlled trial {{to determine if a}} post-discharge transitional care programme can reduce readmissions of such patients in Singapore. Methods: We randomised 840 patients with two or more unscheduled readmissions in the prior 90 days and Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity of patient, Emergency department utilisation score ≥ 10 to the intervention programme (n = 419) or control (n = 421). Patients allocated to the intervention group received post-discharge surveillance by a <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>integrated</b> care <b>team</b> and early review in the clinic. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with at least one unscheduled readmission within 30 days after discharge. Results: We found no statistically significant reduction in readmissions or emergency department visits in patients on the intervention group compared to usual care.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In view of {{the plethora}} of {{different}} community-based mental health services, {{there is a clear}} need for a classification based on service components rather than labels. Moreover, the sustainability of experimental services beyond their research studies is rarely reported. METHODS: As part of a systematic review of home treatment for mental health problems, authors of all included studies were followed up for data on service components and sustainability. Associations between components were explored. RESULTS: There was evidence of a core group of components co-occurring in home treatment services: regularly visiting at home, taking responsibility for health and social care, having smaller caseloads, <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>teams,</b> <b>integrated</b> psychiatrists and a high proportion of contacts at home. Fifty-four per cent of services no longer existed, of which almost half had ended by the study's publication date. There was a significant association between sustainability and the study's hospitalisation outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the related service components presented here were associated with reducing hospitalisation. This group cannot, however, be used to provide a new taxonomy of services.

However, {{a significant proportion of}} these patients do not undergo surgical AVR due to high-risk features. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an alternative for patients with severe AS who are not candidates for open-heart surgery. Since the introduction of TAVI to the medical community in 2002, there has been an explosive growth in procedures. The balloon-expandable Edwards SAPIEN valve and the self-expanding CoreValve ReValvingTM system contribute the largest patient experience with more than 10, 000 patients treated with TAVI to date.

Objective To {{provide an overview of}} the research evidence on effects of organizational strategies to implement improvements in patient care. Design Structured review of published reviews of rigorous evaluations. Data sources Published reviews of studies on organizational interventions. Review methods Searches were conducted in two data-bases (Pubmed, Cochrane Library) and in selected journals. Reviews were included, if these were based on a systematic search, focused on rigorous evaluations of organizational changes, and were published between 1995 and 2003. Two investigators independently extracted information from the reviews regarding their clinical focus, methodological quality and main quantitative findings. Results A total of 36 reviews were included, but not all were high-quality reviews. The reviews were too heterogeneous for quantitative synthesis. None of the strategies produced consistent effects. Professional performance was generally improved by revision of professional roles and computer systems for knowledge management. Patient outcomes was generally improved by <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>teams,</b> <b>integrated</b> care services, and computer systems. Cost savings were reported from integrated care services.

Electroporation has become a widely used technology applicable to e. g. cancer treatment, gene transfection, food and biomass processing, and microbial inactivation. However, despite significant progress of electroporation-based applications, there is a lack of coordination and interdisciplinary exchange of knowledge between researchers from different scientific domains. Thus, critical mass for new major breakthroughs is missing. This COST Action aims at: (i) providing necessary steps towards EU cooperation of science and technology to foster basic understanding of electroporation, (ii) improving communication between EU research groups, resulting in streamlining European R&D activities, and (iii) enabling further development of new and existing electroporation-based applications by <b>integrating</b> <b>multidisciplinary</b> research <b>teams,</b> as well as comprehensive training for Early-Stage Researchers (ESRs). Results of this COST Action will provide multiple societal, scientific, and technological benefits from improving existing electroporation-based applications and adding new ones in the field of medicine, biotechnology and environment preservation...|$|R
