In the recent years, the Web of Data has increased significantly, containing {{a huge number of}} RDF triples. Integrating data described in different RDF datasets and creating semantic links among them, {{has become one of the}} most important goals of RDF applications. These links express semantic correspondences between ontology entities or data. Among the different kinds of semantic links that can be established, identity links express that different resources refer to the same real world entity. By comparing the number of resources published on the Web with the number of identity links, one can observe that the goal of building a Web of data is still not accomplished. Several data linking approaches infer identity links using keys. Nevertheless, in most datasets published on the Web, the keys are not available and it can be difficult, even for an expert, to declare them. The aim of this thesis is to study the problem of automatic key discovery in RDF data and to propose new efficient approaches to tackle this problem. Data published on the We...|$|R

I had more confidence when I got out of jail because the day when I got out of jail I started selling weed. I ain't had no money after the first two months, like, 'I was way better off in jail.'

I understand that my thesis may be made electronically available to the public. ii A wide range of libraries are available for a developer to choose from when building a software system, but once the library is chosen, the developer must determine which version of the library to use. Is there some characteristic that can identify the optimal version of a library to use? Even if a library compiles correctly, {{there could be a}} better version of that library that will provide better error handling, or improved security. In particular, the developer would prefer to avoid poor configurations: that is, sets of libraries that perform poorly, or not at all. This paper describes a method by which a sub performing version of a library can be identified from the behavior observed from different configurations of the library. Each library is measured by performance and trace analysis. During the course of these runs, different configurations of the library are substituted in and the results are collected to be analyzed. The results of this analysis shows that there is no quick way to identify a sub performing library. However such a library can be determined through concentrated efforts to collect and analyze time-based data. iii Acknowledgements I would like to thank <b>my</b> <b>mom</b> <b>and</b> dad, <b>my</b> two brothers, my grandmother, my cousins, <b>my</b> aunts <b>and</b> uncles, <b>my</b> friends <b>and</b> <b>my</b> supervisors. i...|$|R
