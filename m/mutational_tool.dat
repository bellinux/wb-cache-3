40|$|This report {{presents}} the nucleotide sequence and insertional activity of IS 1163, {{which is a}} new member of the IS 3 family of transposable elements. Analysis of spontaneous mutants of the lactocin S-producing Lactobacillus sake strain L 45 show that the bacteriocin-negative phenotype is due to either loss of the producer plasmid or the insertion of IS 1163 into the lactocin S operon (las operon). The data further show that insertional inactivation of the lactocin S operon {{is the result of}} a transposition event involving a chromosomally located donor copy of IS 1163. Although the insertions described are clustered within a 250 -bp region of the las operon, there are no features of the insertion sites to suggest target-specific insertion of IS 1163. The overlapping, frameshifted organization of the two major open reading frames found in IS 1163 is typical for the IS 3 family, but the structure of the putative frameshift region includes features which distinguish IS 1163 from the other members of the group. The insertional activity of IS 1163 in L. sake L 45 has aided in identifying regions of pCIM 1 essential for lactocin S production and may have further practical applications as a <b>mutational</b> <b>tool</b> in L. sake...|$|E
40|$|Metastatic {{colorectal}} cancer harboring a mutation in codon 12 or 13 of the KRAS gene does {{not benefit from}} therapy with antibodies targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The implementation of community KRAS testing is generating a rapid flow of new data that have implications for the pathologist and testing guidelines, besides the physician. Therefore, it seems timely to draw together the threads of this large body of information in order that pathologists can be knowledgeable partners in the multidisciplinary process of targeted cancer therapy, and to help refine current testing guidelines. This review addresses: (1) the most relevant methodological and technical aspects of KRAS testing in terms of sample site (primary/metastatic), test specimens (resection/biopsy/cytology), and the diverse molecular methods available; (2) issues related to daily practice, namely {{the timing of the}} test, its turnaround time and the quality control procedures; and (3) the evidence related to the relationship between KRAS genetic intratumoral heterogeneity, clinical sensitivity of <b>mutational</b> detection <b>tools</b> and anti-EGFR treatment outcome. Hopefully, in the near future, elucidation of the potential of biomarker panels, and of the mechanisms underlying primary and acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy will refine even further personalized treatment regimes for patients with metastatic {{colorectal cancer}}...|$|R
40|$|Alteration {{of correct}} {{splicing}} patterns by disruption of an exonic splicing enhancer {{may be a}} frequent mechanism by which point mutations cause genetic diseases. Spinal muscular atrophy results {{from the lack of}} functional survival of motor neuron 1 gene (SMN 1), even though all affected individuals carry a nearly identical, normal SMN 2 gene. SMN 2 is only partially active because a translationally silent, single-nucleotide difference in exon 7 causes exon skipping. Using ESE motif-prediction <b>tools,</b> <b>mutational</b> analysis and in vivo and in vitro splicing assays, we show that this single-nucleotide change occurs within a heptamer motif of an exonic splicing enhancer, which in SMN 1 is recognized directly by SF 2 /ASF. The abrogation of the SF 2 /ASF-dependent ESE is the basis for inefficient inclusion of exon 7 in SMN 2, resulting in the spinal muscular atrophy phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Interleukin- 10 (IL 10), an {{anti-inflammatory}} cytokine, {{has been}} implicated {{in a variety of}} immune- and inflammatory-related diseases. We investigated the following SNPs: − 1082, − 819, − 592 in the promoter region of IL 10 in a normal (control) population and selected diseases: breast cancer (BrCa), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and found distinct genotype and haplotype patterns. DHPLC was performed using the Transgenomic WAVE instrument, a <b>mutational</b> discovery <b>tool</b> that allows for high throughout analysis of SNPs. The principle of DHPLC is based on separation of homo- and heteroduplex formation of individual polymerase chain reaction products at specific melting temperatures and set gradients. The melting temperature selected for each SNP was based on size and sequence of the polymerase chain reaction product (for − 1082, 57 °C; for − 819, 58 °C; and for − 592, 59. 2 °C). Before fragment mutational analysis, all samples were denatured at 95 °C and slowly reannealed to allow for reassociation of different strands. Heteroduplex samples were easily distinguished from homoduplex samples. In order to identify wild type from homozygous mutant, two homoduplex polymerase chain reaction samples had to be mixed together, denatured at 95 °C and reannealed. The homozygous mutant, when combined with wild type, displayed a double peak on chromatogram. Once distinct chromatograms were established for each of the SNPs and the nucleotide changes confirmed by sequencing, genotype and haplotype frequencies were tabulated for the groups studied...|$|R
40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} ranked {{the third most}} common cancer {{worldwide}} in terms of incidence and the second in terms of mortality. Recent advances in therapeutic approaches to colorectal cancer have identified a potential role of antiepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted therapies as adjuvant treatment in advanced disease. New evidences showed that patients harboring KRAS mutations on codons 12 and 13 are not responsive to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, new <b>mutational</b> screening <b>tools</b> have been proposed to select patients who will benefit from anti-EGFR targeted therapy, reducing inappropriate, expensive treatments and unwarranted side effects. We evaluated {{the performance of a}} reverse-hybridization-based assay in the identification of the most frequent KRAS mutations on a series of 50 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, advanced colorectal cancer specimens, in comparison with the direct gene sequencing technique. Thirtytwo of the 50 cases (64 %) showed KRAS single point mutations by reverse-hybridization technique. In particular, 93. 8 % of the mutations were reported on codon 12, whereas 6. 2 % of the mutations were reported on codon 13. Direct gene sequencing showed KRAS mutations on 28 of the 50 cases (56 %) with 96. 4 % of the mutations on codon 12 and 3. 6 % on codon 13. Concordance between the assays was observed in 92 % of the cases. Both reverse hybridization and gene sequencing methods {{have been shown to be}} suitable tests in detecting KRAS mutations from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens. In our experience, reverse-hybridization technique has been shown to be an effective and more sensitive assay for the identification of the most common KRAS mutations...|$|R
40|$|From {{femtosecond}} bond vibrations to millisecond domain motions, {{the dynamics}} of biomolecules spans {{a wide range of}} time and length scales. This hierarchy of overlapping scales links the molecular and biophysical details to key aspects of their functionality. However, the span of scales combined with their intricate coupling rapidly drives atomic simulation methods to their limits, thereby often resulting in the need for coarse-graining techniques which cannot take full account of the biochemical details. To overcome this tradeoff, a graph-theoretical framework inspired by multiscale community detection methods and stochastic processes is here introduced for the analysis of protein and DNA structures. Using biophysical force fields, we propose a general mapping of the 3 D atomic coordinates onto an energy-weighted network that includes the physico-chemical details of interatomic bonds and interactions. Making use of a dynamics-based approach for community detection on networks, optimal partitionings of the structure are identified which are biochemically relevant over different scales. The structural organisation of the biomolecule is shown to be recovered bottom-up over the entire range of chemical, biochemical and biologically meaningful scales, directly from the atomic information of the structure, and without any reparameterisation. This methodology is applied and discussed in five proteins and an ensemble of DNA quadruplexes. In each case, multiple conformations associated with different states of the biomolecule or stages of the underlying catalytic reaction are analysed. Experimental observations are shown to be correctly captured, including the functional domains, regions of the protein with coherent dynamics such as rigid clusters, and the spontaneous closure of some enzymes in the absence of substrate. A computational <b>mutational</b> analysis <b>tool</b> is also derived which identifies both known and new residues with a significant impact on ligand binding. In large multimeric structures, the methodology highlights patterns of long range communication taking place between subunits. In the highly dynamic and polymorphic DNA quadruplexes, key structural features for their physical stability and signatures of their unfolding pathway are identified in the static structure.

40|$|The {{existence}} of distinct species {{of life is}} generally explained by the genetic process of reproduction without recombination between populations and/or the ecological process of adaptation to different environments. Both processes affect prokaryotes, and have shaped existing genomes. Here, we use comparative genomic techniques to evaluate the dynamics of divergence among species of the Enterobacteriaceae. Bacteria such as Escherichia coli preferentially acquire allelic variants from closely related organisms (i. e. other E. coli) rather than from more diverged bacteria. Ecological differences between donor and recipient affect the probability of allelic variants becoming fixed across the recombining population. We examine the history of recombination among groups of genomes that no longer recombine with each other, but retain sufficient conservation of ancestral nucleotide sequences to allow recombination to be inferred. From these analyses, we conclude that substantial levels of recombination occurred between E. coli and diverging lineages even after some regions of the genomes had acquired many nucleotide differences. We identify two evolutionary radiations leading to E. coli where the disparity among loci confounds the phylogenetic relationships among species, as evidenced by topological incongruence among gene trees. The forces affecting recombination, reflected in both pairwise divergence and topologically informative sites, vary across regions of the genome measuring tens of kilobases. To {{examine the relationship between}} ecological differentiation and genetic recombination, we characterize differences that could be responsible for ecological differentiation among these species. Some of the loci with the most apparent functional differences (i. e. the gain and loss of genes) are associated with the greatest levels of sequence divergence between species, consistent with the hypothesis that ecological divergence interferes with homologous recombination, and therefore drives sequence divergence and genetic isolation. To investigate the role of more subtle ecological differentiation, we develop a statistical framework to evaluate codon usage bias of each protein-coding gene, taking into account the stochastic balance between codon selection, which is driven by the need for high expression, and <b>mutational</b> biases. This <b>tool</b> will be useful in future studies examining codon selection as contribution to diversification among the ecologically diverse species of Enterobacteriaceae...|$|R
