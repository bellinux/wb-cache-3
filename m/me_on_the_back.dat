500|$|Van Peebles {{knew that}} in order to spread his message, the film [...] "simply couldn't be a didactic {{discourse}} which would end up playing [...] to an empty theater except for ten or twenty aware brothers who would pat <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and say it tells it like it is" [...] and that [...] "to attract the mass we have to produce work that not only instructs but entertains". Van Peebles also wanted to make a film that would [...] "be able to sustain itself as a viable commercial product [...] ain't about to go carrying no messages for you, especially a relevant one, for free." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool captain Yeats {{collected}} the trophy from Queen Elizabeth II in the Royal box at Wembley Stadium. The victory was the club's {{first in the}} competition. Liverpool manager Shankly was delighted with the result and hailed the achievement: [...] "To think a team like Liverpool had never won the FA up was unbelievable, so many had prayed {{for it to happen}} over all the years, but it had never come to pass. So when we beat Leeds, the emotion was unforgettable." [...] Despite breaking his collarbone in the opening minutes, Liverpool defender Gerry Byrne completed the whole match. Shankly was full of praise for the defender stating: [...] "Byrne was absolutely fantastic. He played the best game of his life." [...] Bryne was concerned about collecting his medal, stating: [...] "I was worried about going up to collect my medal, so many of our fans wanted to slap <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> I had to keep twisting and turning to avoid the congratulations." ...|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{condition}} declined precipitously in September. Keyboardist Tony Brown {{remembers the}} singer's arrival at a University of Maryland concert: [...] "He {{fell out of}} the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, Is the tour gonna happen?" [...] Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, [...] "He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions". Wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in Detroit, [...] "I watched him in his dressing room, just draped over a chair, unable to move. So often I thought, 'Boss, why don't you just cancel this tour and take a year off...?' I mentioned something once in a guarded moment. He patted <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and said, 'It'll be all right. Don't you worry about it.'" [...] Presley continued to play to sellout crowds.|$|E
60|$|The {{offer was}} {{accepted}} {{with an almost}} youthful alacrity of gesture. The Capuchin took the largest pinch I ever saw held between any man's finger and thumb--inhaled it slowly without spilling a single grain--half closed his eyes--and, wagging his head gently, patted <b>me</b> paternally <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Then ye'd {{better make}} a {{scientific}} note {{of it in}} yer book, for I see 'em at this good minit dancin' about like will-o'-the-wisps in a bog of Ould Ireland. There, help <b>me</b> <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> o' <b>the</b> baste--bad luck to the badgers, say I." ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{made him}} this answer every feature of Mr. Pickwick's face fused itself into one all-pervading {{expression}} of delight. After shaking me heartily by both hands at once, he patted <b>me</b> gently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> and then - I well understood why - coloured {{up to the}} eyes, and hoped with great earnestness of manner {{that he had not}} hurt me.|$|R
500|$|Throughout all this, Gladstone was {{supported}} {{not only by}} the popular and charismatic Rosebery but also by an array of well-dressed women including Lady Rosebery and Gladstone's daughter Mary. These fashionable people– the celebrities of their day (newspapers at the time gave many column inches each day to the doings of the upper classes)– were as much a crowd-puller as the political speakers, and Rosebery's planning used that to full effect. One meeting was so packed that many were fainting: 70,000 people applied for tickets in a hall capable of holding 6,500. Lady Rosebery reported, [...] "I had never heard Archie (Lord Rosebery) speak in public politically before, but after the first minute I felt I could never be nervous at his making a speech the audience show him great affection." [...] However it was not just Gladstone and Rosebery the huge crowds had come to see, but also the dutifully supporting and smiling families. Lady Rosebery went on to describe how [...] "They (the crowds) patted <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> till my shoulders were sensitive." [...] Thus in Rosebery's first serious involvement in politics, Disraeli was defeated and the newly elected MP for Midlothian became Prime Minister for the second time (the caretaker liberal leader Lord Hartington retired in favour of Gladstone). It was also obvious that Lady Rosebery was a very evident and valuable political electioneering asset. As the Marquess of Crewe put it [...] "she had cut her spurs." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{know you}} told me {{something}} I've never forgotten and that again and again has {{made me think of}} you since; it was that tremendously hot day when we went to Sorrento, across the bay, for the breeze. What I allude to was what you said to <b>me,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way <b>back,</b> as we sat under the awning of the boat enjoying the cool. Have you forgotten?" ...|$|R
60|$|After {{that the}} man turns, sudden, to laughing. He leans against a corner and laughs considerable. Then he claps <b>me</b> and Tobin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of us and takes us by an arm apiece.|$|R
60|$|For {{about three}} seconds all was joy, jollity, and goodwill. The old boy {{shook hands with}} <b>me,</b> slapped Corky <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> said that he didn't think {{he had ever seen}} such a fine day, and whacked his leg with his stick. Jeeves had {{projected}} himself into the background, and he didn't notice him.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the passage}} outside, Gussie gurgled with joy and slapped <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> 'Bertie, old man, it's all right. I'm the happiest man in New York.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look there!" [...] rang in my ear, and Jones smashed <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> with a blow, {{which at}} any {{ordinary}} time would have laid me flat.|$|E
60|$|He moved buoyantly {{from the}} wash-hand stand, and endeavoured to slosh <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> again. Foiled by my nimble footwork, he {{staggered}} {{to the bed}} and sat down upon it.|$|E
60|$|Another time, in {{the same}} region, a solitary lynx made me uncomfortable for half an afternoon. It was Sunday, and I had gone for a snowshoe tramp, leaving my rifle behind <b>me.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> way <b>back</b> to camp I stopped for a caribou head and skin, which I had cached <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of a barren the morning before. The weather had changed; a bitter cold wind blew after me as I turned toward camp. I carried the head with its {{branching}} antlers <b>on</b> my shoulder; <b>the</b> skin hung down, to keep my back warm, its edges trailing in the snow.|$|R
3000|$|... “This is my fourteen-year dream”, said Ellis to <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way <b>back</b> {{from that}} Brookhaven trip. He was {{referring}} to the day he and his colleagues at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute discovered the human TCR in the early 1980 s. We both were so excited and kept chatting about how to proceed that we didn’t notice <b>the</b> downpour going <b>on</b> outside <b>the</b> coach. We finally realized that the poor driver missed our exit to Boston <b>on</b> <b>the</b> highway and we were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way to Maine! The trip took more than two hours longer it should be, yet the sweet memory is still kept vividly present in my brain ever since.|$|R
40|$|He and I {{got into}} the verbal altercation … so {{he thought he would}} put me in my place by {{throwing}} <b>me</b> up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> chair, then letting me hang there.

6000|$|He said--"It's {{all right}} in summer, and it's good enough in winter--WHILE IT LASTS. You {{make the most of}} it, young 'un;" [...] and he slapped <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and laughed.|$|E
6000|$|... "He’s a prize-fighter," [...] {{said the}} other, in awe-inspiring tones; [...] "’the Battersea Bruiser.’ Consequently when he clapped <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> {{and asked me}} when the banns was to be, I only smiled." ...|$|E
60|$|HARRY. I don't {{hate and}} despise them. I think that's odious. But {{sometimes}} they're not very tactful. I don't know that I much {{want one of}} my clerks to come and slap <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> {{in the office and}} call me old chap.|$|E
60|$|Was {{this not}} enough to turn any man's {{naturally}} sweet disposition to gall? No doubt my mobile face betrayed something of the bitterness of my thoughts, for M. Goldberg at one moment slapped <b>me</b> vigorously <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and bade <b>me</b> be of good cheer, as things were not so bad as I imagined. I was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> point of asking him what he meant when I saw another gentleman advancing toward me. His face, which was sallow and oily, bore a kind of obsequious smile; his clothes were of rusty black, and his features were markedly Jewish in character. He had some law papers under his arm, and he was perpetually rubbing his thin, bony hands together {{as if he were}} for ever washing them.|$|R
5000|$|... "It's {{definitely}} a big factor. You can totally {{tell the difference}} when there's a guy out there playing with confidence and when a guy's unsure of himself. Being a fourth-year pro, it makes a huge difference. Each year, you {{come in with a}} little more confidence, and I’ve been fortunate enough to be surrounded by some great players and coaches who were there to give <b>me</b> a pat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> or help <b>me</b> out and keep me motivated." ...|$|R
60|$|Two days arterwards {{he thought}} of something; he remembered me. He 'ad found a dirty old {{envelope}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, and with a bit o' lead pencil he wrote <b>me</b> a letter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of one o' the bills, telling me all his troubles, and asking me to bring some clothes and rescue 'im. He stuck <b>on</b> one of <b>the</b> stamps he 'ad found in George's pocket, and opening the door just afore going to bed threw it out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pavement.|$|R
60|$|A gentleman {{sitting behind}} me tapped <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> {{and asked for}} a light. He was a footman, or rather valet. He had no livery, but the three friends who {{accompanied}} him were tall men in pepper-and-salt undress jackets with a duke's coronet on their buttons.|$|E
60|$|We stopped {{long enough}} to give father a {{detailed}} account of our adventures, and by the way he slapped <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> after the story was brought to an end, I knew that he felt right well pleased because I had begun serving my country in such a satisfactory manner.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jaggers {{had seen}} me with Estella, {{and was not}} likely to have missed the sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded when I said the subject was painful to me, clapped <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> put round the wine again, and went on with his dinner.|$|E
6000|$|... "I got {{a kind of}} scare at this. I couldn't make a sound, but I {{pointed at}} the one that sparkled white and blue. He {{put it in his}} {{waistcoat}} pocket, paid for it with a lot of sovereigns, and bolted out. When we got on board I was quite out of breath. 'Shake hands, old chap,' I gasped out. He gave <b>me</b> a thump <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> 'Give what orders you like to the boatswain when the hands turn-to,' says he; 'I am off duty this afternoon.' ...|$|R
60|$|Their very {{attitudes were}} abject, and the {{expression}} of their countenances distrustful, surprised, and startled. After we had presented them with some scarlet cloth, which they immediately tied round their necks, they became good friends. This was shown by the old man patting our breasts, and making a chuckling kind of noise, as people do when feeding chickens. I walked with the old man, and this demonstration of friendship was repeated several times; it was concluded by three hard slaps, which were given <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> breast and <b>back</b> at <b>the</b> same time. He then bared his bosom for me to return the compliment, which being done, he seemed highly pleased. The language of these people, according to our notions, scarcely deserves to be called articulate. Captain Cook has compared it to a man clearing his throat, but certainly no European ever cleared his throat with so many hoarse, guttural, and clicking sounds.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have no one}} to go to," [...] {{the girl}} said simply. [...] "My father bought this place and moved here from Georgia only six years ago, and all my friends are in that State. Except our neighbors round here I do not know a soul in Tennessee. Besides, what can I do in a town? We can manage here, because we have a few fowls, and some of our neighbors last spring plowed an acre or two of ground and planted corn for us, and I have a little money left for buying other things; but it would not last us a month if we went into a town. No, I have nothing to do but to stay here until you drive <b>the</b> Yankees <b>back.</b> I will willingly take you down to the boat to-night. Chloe can come with us and keep <b>me</b> company <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way <b>back.</b> Of course it would not be safe to cross in the daytime." ...|$|R
60|$|North {{came to see}} me in {{my three}} rooms and bath, extra charge for light when used extravagantly or all night. He slapped <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> (I would rather have my shins kicked any day), and greeted me with out-door obstreperousness and revolting good spirits. He was insolently brown and healthy-looking, and offensively well dressed.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may rely on my discretion," [...] I replied, {{throwing}} the time-honoured prejudices {{of the profession}} to the winds, and well pleased to aid and abet the simple-minded soul in his nefarious designs against little Sannie's digestive apparatus. He patted <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> [...] "PEPPERMINT lollipops, mind!" [...] he went on, in the same solemn undertone. [...] "Sannie likes them best--peppermint." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, {{some years}} ago I was visited by a {{grinning}} son-of-a-gun from New York--no other than the great T.R. I took him around. He was most interested in my troops. After he had inspected them, and particularly the Imperial Guard, he slapped <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and shouted, [...] "Bill, you could lick the world!" ... And, my son, I fell for it!'" ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{also was}} the {{presenter}} of the infamous Soccer's Hard Men video released in 1992, which featured archived footage of him and many other [...] "hard men" [...] of the game, and included advice for budding [...] "hard men". After {{the release of the}} video, Jones was fined £20,000 and given a six-month ban (suspended for three years) for [...] "bringing the game into disrepute". Wimbledon chairman Sam Hammam branded Jones a [...] "mosquito brain". After this incident, Jones failed to stay out of trouble. After exceeding 40 disciplinary points that season, he was once again summoned to Lancaster Gate, the headquarters of The Football Association, but failed to appear. The FA banned Jones indefinitely. Jones explained that he had [...] "mixed up" [...] the date of the hearing, for which he received a four-match ban and was told by Football Association officials to [...] "grow up". Jones commented later: [...] "The FA have given <b>me</b> a pat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> I've taken violence off the terracing and onto the pitch." ...|$|R
60|$|Was it, as she said, weakness, lack {{of courage}} to take life {{when it was}} offered her?... I was {{suddenly}} filled with the fever of composing arguments to change a decision that appeared {{to me to be}} the result of a monstrous caprice and delusion; writing them out, as they occurred to <b>me,</b> in snatches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of envelopes--her envelopes. Then I proceeded to make the draft of a letter, the effort required for composition easing me until the draft was finished; when I started for the hotel, climbing fences, leaping streams, making my way across rock faces and through woods; halting now and then as some reenforcing argument occurred to me to write it into my draft at the proper place until the sheets were interlined and blurred and almost illegible. It was already three o'clock when I reached my room, and the mail left at four. I began to copy and revise my scrawl, glancing from time to time at my watch, which I had laid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table. Hurriedly washing my face and brushing my hair, I arrived downstairs just as the stage was leaving....|$|R
5000|$|Mrs Lyth later {{commented that}} she {{went to see the}} play when she was told she'd {{inspired}} it, but she much preferred a play by John Galsworthy that was shown with it in a double-bill,, [...] I was supposed to have inspired him for this play, but I don't know when he ever saw me wooing anybody! ...At that time I ran a café here, in addition to my duties as postmistress, and Mrs Arthur Wontner and her children came in one day for tea. She said, 'You're the lady who inspired G.B.S. for the play, and you must go up and see it'--so I did. Following it in the same programme was one of Galsworthy's plays called The Little Man, which I enjoyed much more than Village Wooing. I don't say Mr Shaw's aren't good plays, but I think they lack suspense. In spite of that, I wrote and congratulated Dame Sybil Thorndike on her wonderful portrayal of a postmistress in a little village shop. She autographed her picture for <b>me</b> and wrote <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> that she was most interested to know that she had been playing me, and would come and see me one day.|$|R
