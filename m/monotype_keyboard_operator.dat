40|$|Background and Purpose. Alternative {{computer}} keyboards whose halves can be slanted {{toward each other}} can reduce a risk factor (ulnar deviation) for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) affect-ing the upper limbs. Two questions that computer <b>keyboard</b> <b>operators</b> face when using keyboards that can be separated into halves (split keyboards) are: (1) At what angle should the keyboard halves be opened? and (2) At what distance apart should the keyboard halves be placed? The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of the opening angle and separation distance between halves of a split keyboard on wrist ulnar deviation and typing efficiency. Methods. Eleven experienced computer <b>keyboard</b> <b>operators</b> participated in this study and used a split keyboard that was set up in a conventional (nonsplit) format and also in 3 alternative configurations: (1) centers of keyboard halves were separated at 20 -cm distance, (2) keyboard halves were separated half of the distance of shoulder width, an...|$|R
40|$|Background Physical {{examination}} is {{a traditional}} outcome measure in epidemiological research. Its value as a reliable measure depends, in part, on the prevalence of positive findings. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to determine the empirical reliability of physical examination and anthropometry in a field study of upper extremity disorders among <b>keyboard</b> <b>operators.</b> Methods Two experienced examiners independently performed common provocative tests and procedures in physical examinations of the neck and upper extremity among 160 <b>keyboard</b> <b>operators.</b> Two additional examiners conducted anthropometric surveys among 137 workers. Inter-examiner reliability was assessed with observed agreement, kappa statistics, and intra-class correlations (ICC). Results Observed agreement was between 96 % and 100 % for neck and upper extremity signs, muscle stretch reflexes, and muscle strength, however, with the exception of provocative tests, reliability statistics were unstable. Among the provocative tests, Phalen and Tinel tests had modest agreement after adjusting for chance (Κ range: 0. 20 – 0. 43). The carpal compression test had the best reliability (Κ= 0. 60 and Κ= 0. 67, left and right side, respectively). The ICCs for anthropometry ranged from 0. 36 – 0. 91. Conclusions Results from the study showed that statistically, except for the carpal compression test, physical examination contributed minimal reliable information. This was attributed mainly to the low prevalence of positive findings, and generally mild nature of upper extremity disorders in this population. The results are the best estimate of what would be found in a field study with experienced examiners. While it may reduce bias, separating physical examination from medical history may contribute to the poor reliability of findings. With a shift toward reliable measures, resources can be allocated to more effective tools, like questionnaires, in epidemiological research of upper extremity disorders among <b>keyboard</b> <b>operators.</b> Am.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide {{information}} pertaining to performance levels of Dvorak <b>keyboard</b> <b>operators</b> through retraining. More specifically, the purposes of this study were: 1. To compare operator performance rates on the Dvorak <b>keyboard</b> with <b>operator</b> performance rates on the Qwerty keyboard. 2. To determine whether <b>keyboard</b> <b>operators</b> can learn to use the Dvorak keyboard if they were initially trained to use the Qwerty keyboard. Procedures: The participants in this research study included 16 <b>keyboard</b> <b>operators</b> employed in public and private sector agencies and organizations in Oregon. Eight operators used CRT word processors and eight used element correcting typewriters. Each participant received ten hours of keyboard introduction instruction on the Dvorak keyboard, followed by 100 hours of skill-development keyboarding involving both skill-development drill exercise and daily office production correspondence. Nine null hypotheses were developed regarding Dvorak keyboard retraining rates. The t test and one- and two-factor analysis of variance with repeated measures were used to test these null hypotheses. Trend analysis was also used to describe the data. Conclusions: 1. Dvorak keyboard production and straight-copy rates, after 100 hours of skill-development keyboarding, were not significantly greater than preretraining Qwerty keyboard production and straight-copy rates for both CRT and element keyboarding equipment. The learning curve slopes, however, were still upward at the end of 100 hours of skill-, development keyboarding, suggesting that production and straight-copy learning would continue on both types of keyboarding equipment. 2. Dvorak keyboard production rates were found to be significantly different at 20 - and 25 -hour intervals for CRT and element keyboarding equipment, respectively, for 100 hours of skill-development keyboarding. The same was found for combined CRT/element Dvorak keyboard straight-copy rates at ten-hour intervals. 3. The Dvorak keyboard production rate of learning on both types of equipment was found to be linear for 100 hours of skill - development keyboarding. The Dvorak keyboard straight-copy rate was found to be curvilinear. Production rates were not combined as they were for straight-copy performance, since different performance measures were used with each type of keyboard equipment. Recommendations: 1. Studies should be undertaken involving retraining of students in a classroom environment. 2. Studies should be undertaken to determine production performance unique to certain keyboarding tasks. For example, performance indicators should be established for transcription and rough-draft production activities. 3. Research projects should be undertaken addressing reduction of operator fatigue and ease of keyboard operation resulting from retraining on the Dvorak keyboard. 4. Studies should be undertaken to compare the learning rates of beginning keyboard students on the Dvorak and Qwerty keyboards under experimental conditions...|$|R

40|$|Often {{considered}} no {{more than}} an historical curiosity, writer’s cramp remains an important disability in the workplace and the mechanism, which has puzzled the best medical minds for generations, remains contentious. A remarkable range of hypotheses has been put forward to try and explain a disability which periodically reached epidemic and economically worrying levels, but in the end medical opinion has accepted the explanation put forward by neurologists Sheehy andMarsden in 1983 that this was caused by a form of focal dystonia. However, the majority of the historical descriptions of writer’s cramp do not fit the classical parameters of focal dystonia and are more accurately described as a progressive forearm muscle fatigue. Today’s <b>keyboard</b> <b>operators</b> continue to complain of symptoms identical to their clerical forebears demonstrating that this is a problem which has evolved but not disappeared; this has the paradoxical advantage that modern research techniques enable this complaint to be revisited.

40|$|In the mid 1980 s {{the problem}} of {{occupational}} overuse injuries, particularly among <b>keyboard</b> <b>operators,</b> gained widespread recognition in Australia. The country appeared to be experiencing an epidemic, the like of which was unknown elsewhere in the world. Three explanations are canvassed in the paper: first, the psychiatric theory {{that it was a}} case of 'epidemic hysteria'; second the hypothesis that there really were more such injuries in Australia than elsewhere; and third, the hypothesis that the institutions of Australian society facilitated recognition of the problem, while those of other countries repress awareness of it. The paper focusses on this last hypothesis and seeks to demonstrate it by means of a comparison between Australia and the United States. It shows how, in particular, the system of workers' compensation in the Australian public service facilitated recognition of the problem, while the compensation system in the United States makes it very difficult for sufferers to have their disability acknowledged.

The Upper Extremity Questionnaire is a self-administered questionnaire designed for epidemiological studies and tested among workers. This study assessed reliability of the instrument. Methods A two-part assessment was conducted among 138 <b>keyboard</b> <b>operators</b> {{as part of a}} large medical survey. Test-retest reliability was analyzed using the kappa statistic, paired t-test, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Logistic regression models were used to test the effect of demographic and work-related factors on reliability. Results The average respondent was a white woman, age 35 years, with some college education, in permanent employment with tenure of 1. 4 years. Overall, reports of symptoms were stable from Round 1 to 2. Most kappa values for symptom reports were between 0. 60 and 0. 89. Kappa values for right and left hand diagrams were 0. 57 and 0. 28, respectively. Among psychosocial items, Perceived Stress and Job Dissatisfaction Scales were most reliable (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 88); co-worker support was least reliable (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 44). Conclusion Reliability of items on the Upper Extremity Questionnaire were generally good to excellent. Reports of symptom severity and interference with work were less stable.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the association and impact of occupational exposure and diseases of the shoulder and neck. Prevalence rates, odds ratios, aetiological fractions, and their confidence intervals were computed for pooled and non-pooled data of previous published reports. By comparison with office workers and farmers, dentists had an increased odds ratio for cervical spondylosis (two studies) and for shoulder joint osteoarthrosis. Meat carriers, miners, and "heavy workers " also had significantly higher rates of cervical spondylosis compared with referents. Compared with iron foundry workers, civil servants had a significant odds ratio (4 - 8) of cervical disc disease and a 0 79 aetiological fraction. Whether this was due to exposure or healthy worker effect was not clear. In four occupational groups with high shoulder-neck load an odds ratio of 4 0 was found for thoracic outlet syndrome with an aetiological fraction of 0 75.

The associated machine uses the outward codes in these dots to direct bundles of letters into the correct bags for specific delivery offices. With a machine knowledge of the specific addresses handled by each postal walk at each office, the bundles can be further sorted using the dots of the inward sorting code so that each delivery round receives only its own letters. This feature depends upon {{whether or not it}} is cost effective to second-sort outward letters, and tends to be used only at main sorting offices where high volumes are handled. When postcodes are incomplete or missing, the operator reads the post town name and inserts a code sufficient for outward sorting to the post town where others can further direct it. The mail bags of letter bundles are sent by road, air or train, and eventually by road to the delivery office. At the delivery office the mail that is handled manually is inward sorted to the postal walk that will deliver it, and it is then [...] "set in", sorted into the walk order that allows the deliverer the most convenient progress in the round.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} has been to find, if possible, prognostic tests by means of which we may discover the qualities essential to typists and other <b>keyboard</b> <b>operators</b> and {{to determine whether the}} Aptitude Machine devised by Dr. Charles Fordyce {{can be used as a}} means of determining aptitudes in the use of the typewriter, comptometer, and other similar machines. The scope of {{this investigation}} was limited to the students in the Senior High School of University City, Missouri, St. Louis County. Our findings indicate that mental and clerical tests measure qualities and aptitudes so remotely related to those demanded in typing as to be of little value, if any value, to the instructor of typing, but the correlation between the scores in the aptitude testing apparatus and the achievement scores made at the close of a semester of practice in typing is sufficiently high to give evidence that this measuring device may serve as a valuable instrument in foreshadowing typewriting ability. We therefore recommend its use among instructors of typewriting. The two tests given on the aptitude testing machine, the one with controlled rhythm and the other with the rhythm at the student’s own rate, indicate that the one with the controlled rhythm is decidedly better as a prognostic measure. Since the modern typewriter, particularly the noiseless variety, requires such a delicate touch, and since the aptitude testing apparatus, devised by Dr. Fordyce, demands such a vigorous stroke, we recommend that this apparatus be so modified that its keys may respond more nearly as do those in the modern typewriter.
