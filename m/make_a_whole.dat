500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{reviewed}} the episode, simply saying he [...] "loved this episode," [...] {{giving it a}} perfect 10 out of 10 score. Canning enjoyed Jack and Devon's back-and-forth, and wrote that Jenna and Tracy [...] "tormenting" [...] Liz in their separate ways were [...] "equally gratifying." [...] Meredith Blake, a contributor from the Los Angeles Times opined, [...] "To all those haters who say 30 Rock is losing its touch, I say 'poppycock!' [...] was proof that the show is as zippy as ever." [...] She noted that Jack's plot [...] "didn't <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot of sense", nonetheless [...] "anything that means more Will Arnett on 30 Rock is fine by me." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad reported {{it was great to}} see Jack and NBC [...] "still being affected by the economy, government bailouts, and Washington hearings". Sassone much preferred [...] "Into the Crevasse" [...] than [...] "Season 4". New York magazine contributor Mark Graham said this episode of 30 Rock saw the series [...] "once again hitting a familiar, meta-flavored stride, as Tina Fey and her writing staff tried a 'ripped from the headlines' approach and took on recent real-life story lines like the 30 Rock porno". [...] "The return of Will Arnett, the existence of a Porn Liz, and one deal breaker after another: 'Into the Crevasse' had some killer lines, even if it didn't come together in one big narrative", remarked Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly. In his recap, TV Guides [...] Michael Anthony said that the Jack and Devon characters [...] "really [...] how to put a playful spin" [...] on the bail out and government money story.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Unterberger of PopDust also {{questioned}} the song's lyrics, writing that [...] "the song doesn’t <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot of sense" [...] and noting [...] "the odd phrasing {{of the title}} and certain other key lyrics." [...] Unterberger also noted that [...] "The phrase 'I want it that way' is similarly devoid of inherent meaning, but it’s used recurringly {{as a kind of}} conclusive phrase, always calling back to those first two lines, as the song gets gradually more despairing in nature." [...] Unterberger also found out that [...] "The chorus would appear to be in direct opposition {{to the rest of the}} song." ...|$|E
2500|$|Radke {{discussed}} {{his relationship with}} Escape the Fate members since his departure from the band, stating that {{they have tried to}} reconcile with Radke but he was uninterested in getting back on friendly terms with them after they kicked him out and misinformed their fans about Radke getting caught with heroin inside prison. Radke stated in an interview, [...] "They <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> album called This War Is Ours, and then they try to say, 'We didn't name that album after you, dude.' Which in fact, they did. I could be wrong; they could be talking about the war on terrorism or something. I don't know. But I just have a feeling that record name was about me. They talk a lot of shit. It is always about forgive and forget, but there's some things that I would like to say. So I did. On the record." ...|$|E

2500|$|In metaphysics, {{there are}} several puzzles {{concerning}} cases of mereological constitution. That is, what <b>makes</b> up <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> We are still concerned with parts and wholes, but instead of looking at what parts <b>make</b> up <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> we are wondering what a thing is made of, such as its materials: [...] e.g. the bronze in a bronze statue. Below {{are two of the}} main puzzles that philosophers use to discuss constitution.|$|R
2500|$|AXS writer Terrance Pryor {{considers}} What to Do When You Are Dead {{a concept}} album [...] "based around the main character's suicide and his {{journey through the}} afterlife". Some observers have noted the character going through the Kübler-Ross 5-stage model of grief management. Jorgensen {{grew up in a}} [...] "very scientific environment," [...] which caused him to be influenced by British writer Craig Hamilton-Parker. The album's title comes from a Hamilton-Parker book. Jorgensen explained that since he was [...] "already writing an album in that way, and when I saw that book, I thought, 'It would be really cool to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> album out of this." [...] Jorgensen later remarked that placing himself in that perspective helped him [...] "face a lot of things I probably would've been too much of a wuss to face, if I didn't pretend I wasn't alive". The band were initially hesitant working on a concept album until they were persuaded by Jorgensen.|$|E
2500|$|In Foundation and Earth, it is {{described}} [...] that the Empire began a restoration of Earth, {{but that this}} was abandoned. There are also descendants of the old population at [...] "Alpha", a planet {{of one of the}} suns of Alpha Centauri. They were settled there by the Empire, which intended to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> terraformed world, but produced just one large island. Janov Pelorat stated that, if he understood the legends of Alpha correctly, the start of the restoration attempt was right before a period of much larger problems for the Empire. Daneel explains that he had a role in attempting the restoration of Earth's soil and also settling humans at [...] "Alpha", but achieved less than he had wanted. [...] Whether he was involved in the actual events of Pebble is not discussed, but strongly implied. [...] It is left open that other refugees from Earth might have settled elsewhere in the universe.|$|E

"There is a cry," [...] said Jack, [...] "which {{the white}} man gives when he enters into battle--a terrible cry, which is quite {{different}} from that of the black man, and which is so awful that it strikes terror into the heart of {{the white man}}'s enemies, and has even been known to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> army fly almost without a shot being fired.

60|$|But, dear Mr. Chorley, {{you don't}} silence me, notwithstanding. The spell of your {{dedication}} hasn't fastened {{me up in}} an oak for ever. Your book is very clever; your characters very incisively given; princess and patriots admirably cut out (and up!); half truths everywhere, to which one says 'How true!' But one might as well (and better) say 'How false!' seeing that, dear Mr. Chorley, it does really take two halves to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> and we know it. The whole truth is not here--not even suggested here--and let me add that the half truth on this occasion is cruel.|$|E
2500|$|To {{explain the}} process, {{consider}} {{one third of}} one quarter. Using {{the example of a}} cake, if three small slices of equal size <b>make</b> up <b>a</b> quarter, and four quarters <b>make</b> up <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> twelve of these small, equal slices <b>make</b> up <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> Therefore, <b>a</b> third of a quarter is a twelfth. Now consider the numerators. The first fraction, two thirds, is twice as large as one third. Since one third of a quarter is one twelfth, two thirds of a quarter is two twelfth. [...] The second fraction, three quarters, is three times as large as one quarter, so two thirds of three quarters is three times as large as two thirds of one quarter. Thus two thirds times three quarters is six twelfths.|$|R

2500|$|The {{numerator}} {{represents a}} number of equal parts, and the denominator, which cannot be zero, indicates {{how many of those}} parts <b>make</b> up <b>a</b> unit or <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> For example, in the fraction 3/4, the numerator, 3, tells us that the fraction represents 3 equal parts, and the denominator, 4, tells us that 4 parts <b>make</b> up <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> The picture to the right illustrates [...] or ¾ of a cake.|$|R
6000|$|He often said, with a {{sound of}} pride: [...] "We don't care a darn for all these would-be social climbers. The wife and I lead a regular Bohemian life.

And one-two of the bunch have got their own cars--I tell you they <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot more coin than a lot of these society-column guys, even if they don't throw on the agony; and we all pile in and go up to some road-house, and sing, and play the piano, and have a real time." ...|$|E
60|$|George now {{began to}} give way to a wicked sarcastic method, which, perhaps, he had {{inherited}} from his grandfather, and with which, when a quiet, skilful young person chooses to employ it, he can <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> family uncomfortable. He took up Ward's pompous remarks and made jokes of them, so that that young divine chafed and almost choked over his great meals. He made Madam Esmond angry, and doubly so when he sent off Harry into fits of laughter. Her authority was defied, her officer scorned and insulted, her youngest child perverted, by the obstinate elder brother. She made a desperate and unhappy attempt to maintain her power.|$|E
60|$|However {{fascinating}} the subject, I do not {{propose to}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> book about Eliphalet. Yet sidelights {{on the life}} of every great man are interesting. And there are a few incidents in his early career which have not gotten into the subscription biographical Encyclopaedias. In several of these volumes, to be sure, we may see steel engravings of him, true likenesses all. His was the type of face which is the glory of the steel engraving,--square and solid, as a corner-stone should be. The very clothes he wore were made for the steel engraving, stiff and wiry in texture, with sharp angles at the shoulders, and sombre in hue, as befit such grave creations.|$|E
2500|$|Chamber music {{performance}} is a specialized field, and requires {{a number of}} skills not normally required {{for the performance of}} symphonic or solo music. Many performers and authors have written about the specialized techniques required for a successful chamber musician.
