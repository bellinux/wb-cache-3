This study evaluated the influence of storage temperature on the microbiological stability of homogenized whole pasteurized milk (75 degrees C/ 15 s) packaged in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) pouch, both monolayer materials pigmented with titanium dioxide (TiO(2)). The storage temperatures investigated were 2, 4, 9, 14, and 16 degrees C. Microbiological evaluation was based on mesophilic and psychrotrophic counts with 7 log CFU/mL and 6 log CFU/mL, respectively, set as upper limits of acceptability for maintaining the quality of milk. The microbiological stability for pasteurized <b>milk</b> <b>packaged</b> in HDPE bottle and stored at 2, 4, 9, 14, and 16 degrees C was estimated at 43, 36, 8, 5, and 3 d, respectively.

30|$|Basically, some {{differences}} in the estimated efficiency among countries {{might be due to}} structural {{differences in the}} farms (e.g., farm size, farmer age, or climate conditions) or, on the other hand, to the farms’ management abilities. In the former case, adjusting the structural constraints can improve scale efficiency and, as a consequence, productivity, whereas in the latter case, the improvement of the management systems used in farms should be encouraged in order that farmers become more efficient in using the bundle of resources at their disposal. Where a degree of inefficiency exists, rather than the <b>Milk</b> <b>Package,</b> all the tools available under the second CAP pillar could support inefficient farmers in maintaining or expanding milk production, which is quite often vital for their economies.|$|E
30|$|The general {{efficiency}} {{that was}} estimated indicates that only small margins for improving technical efficiency might exist and that policies {{should be addressed}} towards other tools for guaranteeing competitiveness.

30|$|The {{search for}} {{balancing}} the bargaining power of farmers {{has led to}} specific legal solutions within the sector. Experience varied between countries although a common feature is derogations to competition policy (Nash et al. 1996; Del Cont et al. 2012, Carrau, 2012; Andries and Garcia Azcarate 2015). Moreover, in Europe the move from price to income support within the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) has increased farmers’ market exposure (Tothova Velazquez 2012; European Commission 2010).

40|$|When {{light comes}} {{into contact with}} milk, the milk will start to {{deteriorate}} and taste bad due to production of off-flavour compounds. Aseptic milk carton packages stored at ambient temperature usually have a layer of aluminium foil, which acts as a barrier for incoming light, water, oxygen and other gases. If the aluminium would not be present the light barrier would mainly consist of the paperboard. In order to develop a <b>milk</b> <b>package</b> without aluminium foil for ambient storage, {{it is important to}} obtain knowledge of light barrier properties of paperboard and plastic caps. When measuring the light barrier in the material two spectrophotometers were used. The spectrophotometers measured the fraction of light that was able to penetrate a sample. The investigation of paperboards for 1 litre packages showed that they had protection against light of wavelengths that induced off flavour reactions with Riboflavin (220 - 375, 410 - 475 nm). But the transmission for light within the range 650 - 700 nm was above 0. 1 %. Those wavelengths induce off flavour reactions with porphyrins and chlorins. Different layers in the paperboard contribute differently to the total light barrier of the paperboard. Exposing a paperboard to sunlight deteriorates its light barrier in the long run, while printing on paperboard improves its light barrier. The plastic caps on packages are a fraction of the total package in term of area. But the light barrier of the total package could be lacking due to the plastic caps which is why they have been investigated. Different colouring pigments give different light barrier properties in the cap...|$|E
40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} culture {{in terms of}} webs of significance comprises even everyday genres, and how everyday genres in turn partake in creating cultural contexts. The theoretical cornerstones {{of this study are}} to be found in a dialogical notion of context and a semiotic notion of culture. Furthermore, the study benefits from the analytical concept of communicative genre by which texts can be set in the broader context of societal or socio-cultural relevancy. The methodological framework – with contrastive viewing as an overall heuristic approach – has been developed by combining elements from linguistic hermeneutics, literary cultural analysis, and critical discourse analysis. The study shows that the most significant trait of Swedish <b>milk</b> <b>package</b> texts is the recontextualization of national historical topics, closely entangled with elements of school discourse and children’s literature. This endows the texts with a certain socio-cultural meaning, even though this meaning is dependent on other interactive resources. However, on recent milk packages, changes of communicative patterns can be seen, indicating socio-cultural change. The most significant trait of German milk packages is – besides the ubiquitous use of fresh generating an advertising context – the recontextualization of the fictionalizing topos of locus amoenus, closely intertwined with control and surveillance. The contrastive viewing of 19 th-century texts in the dissertation makes clear that contemporary German milk packages still imply urban-bourgeois perspectives on rurality. Finally, the study shows that culture in terms of webs of significance has no location where it is, but a location where it is represented – for instance in everyday genre texts. It illustrates how linguistic hermeneutics can be done...|$|E
