Because of the special characteristics of the industry, that is mainly the multi-phase process with multiple units per phase, different planning horizons and different production requirements for each phase, the scheduling of these systems becomes quite complex. Apart from a comprehensive presentation of the set of the modules the system is composed of, together with their interrelationships, the above characteristics are analyzed, and their impact on the production control system is explained. The system is also related to two well-known production control systems, namely MRP-II and Optimised Production Technology.

50|$|A <b>master</b> <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> (MPS) is a {{plan for}} {{individual}} commodities to be produced in each time period such as production, staffing, inventory, etc. It is usually linked to manufacturing where the plan indicates when {{and how much of}} each product will be demanded. This plan quantifies significant processes, parts, and other resources in order to optimize production, to identify bottlenecks, and to anticipate needs and completed goods. Since an MPS drives much factory activity, its accuracy and viability dramatically affect profitability. Typical MPSs are created by software with user tweaking.|$|E

If {{there are}} any errors in the {{inventory}} data, the bill of materials (commonly referred to as 'BOM') data, or the <b>master</b> <b>production</b> <b>schedule,</b> then the output data will also be incorrect ("GIGO": garbage in, garbage out). Data integrity is also affected by inaccurate cycle count adjustments, mistakes in receiving input and shipping output, scrap not reported, waste, damage, box count errors, supplier container count errors, production reporting errors, and system issues. Many of these type of errors can be minimized by implementing pull systems and using bar code scanning.

50|$|The {{other major}} {{drawback}} of MRP {{is that it}} fails to account for capacity in its calculations.

Generally, MRP II {{refers to a system}} with integrated financials. An MRP II system can include finite or infinite capacity planning. But, to be considered a true MRP II system must also include financials. In the MRP II (or MRP2) concept, fluctuations in forecast data are taken into account by including simulation of the <b>master</b> <b>production</b> <b>schedule,</b> thus creating a long-term control. A more general feature of MRP2 is its extension to purchasing, to marketing and to finance (integration of all the functions of the company), ERP has been the next step.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method for <b>master</b> <b>production</b> <b>scheduling</b> (MPS) is presented. The {{objective}} of this new method is to minimize schedule instability in the order driven company. In such companies the order arrival process is highly uncertain, {{and the production of}} an item is usually scheduled only after an order is received. Further, the customer usually demands a short delivery lead time. The new MPS method combines a rolling schedule approach with an overtime or subcontracting capability, and is labelled as MPS with incremental capacity allocation and a rolling horizon (MPS-IR). Two features distinguish this new approach. First, rather than allocating the entire production capacity of a future period at once, the MPS-IR does so in an incremental fashion over multiple periods. Second, rather than scheduling the entire demand for a future demand at once, the MPS-IR does so in an incremental fashion over multiple periods. In experimental tests the MPS-IR was found to outperform a Gantt chart based scheduler. <b>master</b> <b>production</b> <b>scheduling</b> hedging uncertainty...|$|R

The problem is formulated as a mixed integer bilinear program that is optimally solvable for small problem instances. Although the production quantities are decided upon in advance taking into account both demand forecasts and confirmed customer orders, the actual demand figures are usually different due to a highly volatile demand. As such, three families of approximate models, which only generate exact schedules for the immediate time periods, are developed. To better capture the dynamic nature of the problem, the models are implemented on a rolling horizon basis in which key complicating aspects of the exact model, such as major setup time and minimum batch size restriction, are relaxed for the unimplemented portion of the <b>production</b> <b>schedule.</b> Upon carrying out numerical experiments for several problem instances having different degrees of capacity tightness and length of forecasting horizon, the approximate models yield reduced problem dimensionality with substantial savings in computational time while still providing practical proxies for the exact model. <b>Master</b> <b>production</b> <b>scheduling</b> Rolling horizon Demand substitution Approximate models...|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the huge}} amount of similar {{products}} in the automotive industry, {{there is a special}} kind of defining a car with options (marks, attributes), that represent the characteristics features of the vehicle. A model of a car is defined by some basic options like body, engine, gear box and axles. The variants of a model are built by some additional options like color, seats, wheels, mirrors, trims, entertainment and assistant systems etc. Options, that exclude each other (pairwise) build an option-family. That means, that you can choose only one option by each family and you have to choose exactly one option. This kind of product definition fulfill the requirements of an ideal Boolean Algebra and can be helpful to construct a product configurator. Sometimes, a set of options (car features) are combined to an automotive package and are offered by a lower price. A consistent car definition is essential for the production planning and control in the automotive industry, to generate a <b>master</b> <b>production</b> <b>schedule,</b> which is the fundamental for the enterprise resource planning.|$|E
5000|$|MRP is {{concerned}} primarily with manufacturing materials while MRPII {{is concerned}} with the coordination of the entire manufacturing production, including materials, finance, and human relations. The goal of MRPII is to provide consistent data to all members in the manufacturing process as the product moves through the production line. Paper-based information systems and non-integrated computer systems that provide paper or disk outputs result in many information errors, including missing data, redundant data, numerical errors that result from being incorrectly keyed into the system, incorrect calculations based on numerical errors, and bad decisions based on incorrect or old data. In addition, some data is unreliable in non-integrated systems because the same data is categorized differently in the individual databases used by different functional areas. [...] MRPII systems begin with MRP, material requirements planning. MRP allows for the input of sales forecasts from sales and marketing, or of actual sales demand in the form of customers orders. These demands determine the raw materials demand. MRP and MRPII systems draw on a <b>master</b> <b>production</b> <b>schedule,</b> the breakdown of specific plans for each product on a line. While MRP allows for the coordination of raw materials purchasing, MRPII facilitates the development of a detailed production schedule that accounts for machine and labor capacity, scheduling the production runs according to the arrival of materials. An MRPII output is a final labor and machine schedule. Data about the cost of production, including machine time, labor time and materials used, as well as final production numbers, is provided from the MRPII system to accounting and finance.|$|E
50|$|The {{downside}} {{of this method}} {{is that it may}} not be suited for a more complex and repetitive production because it requires perfect contention of the WIP (raw materials and assemblies) on the shop floor: the materials issued to a production order shouldn't interfere with another production order or the next production order of the same kind. This can be done only if all work-steps required to complete the production order are limited more or less to a single work-place. That is why this kind of approach can be implemented for complex products only by using the push strategy. Push strategy means that a complex finished product is divided into many smaller assemblies and even assemblies may contain smaller assemblies and so on. All these assemblies will receive their own production order. These production orders are usually created automatically by the MRP\ERP - system. The ERP system uses Manufacturing resource planning (MRP) for the planning of production orders. Usually only the production planning for the finished product is done manually by the production planner, the assemblies are planned automatically based on backward scheduling. This is especially useful if the assemblies are being produced in another production line, workshop or plant. The {{downside of}} MRP and Push strategy is that it usually leads to larger stocks in the supply chain. That is why Push is regarded as the opposite of lean production because lean production involves the Pull strategy which means that any part should only be produced if there is a certain demand for it and therefore WIP will be small. Push strategy is when MRP is used also to schedule production orders for semi-finished products (assemblies) based on the forecasted demand of the finished product. These assemblies are put into stores without any reference to a certain production order of the finished product. The finished product may not even have had production orders released at the time the assembly was delivered to the store. That is why using MRP to schedule the execution of production orders is by definition a push system because releases are made according to a <b>master</b> <b>production</b> <b>schedule</b> without regard to system status. Hence, no a priori WIP limit exists. However MRP can be designed {{in such a way that}} it has an explicit WIP constraint. That means that assemblies are not produced further if a certain level of inventory is reached. MRP with a WIP constraint can be regarded as a pull system. However, even if a WIP constraint is implemented, Push-strategy generally means that the time, needed from the first operation or assembly until the finished good is obtained, is much longer as opposed to pull-strategy. This is due to the lead-times needed for each assembly and can be analyzed by using a technique called Value stream mapping. There is usually also much more handling: putting the assemblies into the stores, picking the assemblies from stores to the next production step (order) which uses the assembly to make another assembly or finished product. In reality, most firms use both strategies. For example: you could use MRP (push) without WIP constraint to schedule assemblies that are produced in another workshop, plant or external supplier and Kanban (pull) in your own plant. You can also use Kanban to schedule the assemblies in another workshop or plant, but it is usually not done when these assemblies are produced on large machines because with MRP the demand of several days can be comprised in bigger lot sizes of production orders of similar type in such a way that the workshops own scheduling system (MES) is then able to use the available machine-capacity better by bringing the production orders into an optimal sequence using suitable algorithms. This is usually the case when the machines are expensive, their number is relatively small and they have big output-capacities and setup time is expensive. Implementing Kanban in such a case would require to use a bigger number of smaller\cheaper machines, dedicated to certain production lines, in order to react more flexibly to the demand. Another requirement would be that the frequency of transports from\to that plant to be higher and the distance to that plant to be relatively small. These requirements however, cannot be accomplished in each case. On the other side, the workshop (supplier) which manufactures the assemblies may very well use a push strategy or a pull-strategy for delivering the needed materials to each of its own machines.|$|E
