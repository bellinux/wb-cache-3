Modifications developed in wind tunnel testing, comprising the addition of vortex generators to the upper aft portion of the nacelles, deletion of the nozzle <b>door</b> <b>actuator</b> fairing, alterations to the aft end of the landing gear pods and the addition of aft fuselage strakes, reduced this drag decrement to 7%.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{complications}} encountered {{when attempting to}} create a secure pervasive computing environment. The model introduced in this paper is primarily conceptual. The chosen environment is built around a shared space containing a classified network. Since access to the classified network is only available to people once they are in this space, we investigate what is required to ensure only authorised people can enter, which highlights problems inherent {{in any kind of}} physical access control, and then how to carry this through to manage their access to information once inside the space. A layered agent architecture is considered, using real time devices such as biometric mechanisms, <b>door</b> <b>actuators</b> and a smart card reader acting as the lower level agents. These agents are then wrapped in software allowing them to communicate with higher level agents that through the coordination of these low level agents control the security of the pervasive environment. Security is further enhanced, by preventing the classified network from communicating with the network containing the biometric devices and databases. We also consider the security implications of using paper documents within the shared space, as well as the possibility of any other devices that could potentially be used for smuggling information out of the environment. ...|$|R
