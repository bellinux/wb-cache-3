5|$|A later model {{suggested}} that confinement {{resulted from a}} co-rotational eccentricity resonance (CER). The model {{takes into account the}} finite mass of the Adams ring, which is necessary to move the resonance closer to the ring. A byproduct of this theory is a mass estimate for the Adams ring—about 0.002 of the mass of Galatea. A third theory proposed in 1986 requires an additional moon orbiting inside the ring; the arcs in this case are trapped in its stable Lagrangian points. However Voyager 2s observations placed strict constraints on the size and mass of any undiscovered moons, <b>making</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> theory unlikely. Some other more complicated theories hold that a number of moonlets are trapped in co-rotational resonances with Galatea, providing confinement of the arcs and simultaneously serving as sources of the dust.|$|E

5|$|Adler's throat closes {{up during}} the MRI due to an {{allergic}} reaction to gadolinium, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient {{is a man who}} is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for <b>making</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a defibrillator.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, Farrands {{wrote and}} {{directed}} a second documentary film on the Friday franchise, this time directly inspired by Bracke's book. Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th discusses each of the twelve films, from the original to the 2009 remake, {{as well as the}} television series. It is narrated by Corey Feldman, and also features interviews with key individuals in the franchise's history. Farrands has suggested that his work on the well-received 2010 film, , which documented the making of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, demonstrated the possibility for a documentary film that was more in depth and more comprehensive than his previous effort, His Name Was Jason. In <b>making</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> film, Farrands turned to Bracke's book, which he had also worked on, and drew from its structure and content. Curious Goods: Behind the Scenes of Friday the 13th: The Series by Alyse Wax, a retrospective focusing on the 1987 television series, was released in October 2015 by BearManor Media.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} of Benefits Street defended the series, {{arguing that the}} reaction to it demonstrated the importance of <b>making</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> documentary. The series was mentioned in the House of Commons, and prompted some political debate {{on the topic of}} welfare. A number of programmes were commissioned by other channels covering the same topic, while Channel 4 commissioned a follow up series provisionally titled Immigration Street that would follow the lives of immigrants living in the United Kingdom. Benefits Street gave Channel 4 their highest viewing figures for any show since 2012. In August 2014, Love Productions confirmed the second series of Benefits Street was being filmed in Kingston Road, Stockton-on-Tees, England, United Kingdom.

5|$|Barry John {{was born}} in Cefneithin, Carmarthenshire in Wales. He was educated at Gwendraeth Grammar School in the Gwendraeth Valley, north of Llanelli. He {{attended}} Cefenithin Primary, {{and there he was}} fortunate to receive skilled rugby teaching. The headmaster, William John Jones, and teacher Ray Williams, were both former Wales international rugby players. Despite his natural talents, he never played at schoolboy level for Wales, but represented both his school and his local village team, Cefneithin RFC. He once played a game for rival team Pontyberem while still a schoolboy, but John recalls in his autobiography that the local resentment at <b>making</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> sporting faux pas ensured he never did so again. While still a teenager attending grammar school, he made his first top-flight rugby appearance for Llanelli, on 4 January 1964 in an encounter with Moseley. Although Llanelli lost the encounter, John scored a try and converted it, and played in four more matches for the Llanelli senior team {{towards the end of the}} season. He continued to represent Llanelli while at Trinity College, Carmarthen, and gained a reputation as a kicking fly-half with a penchant for putting over dropped goals. During the 1964/65 season, John began to make an impact on the Welsh club scene. His dropped goal against Aberavon on 26 October 1964, only 17games in, was his 11th of the season.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{important}} questions in sleep research is clearly defining the sleep state.

25|$|On 14 March, the Slovak {{parliament}} convened {{and heard}} Tiso's report on his discussion with Hitler {{as well as}} on a possible declaration of independence. Some of the deputies were skeptical of <b>making</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> move, among other reasons {{due to the fact that}} some worried that the Slovak state would be too small and with a strong Hungarian minority. The debate was quickly brought to a head when Franz Karmasin, leader of the German minority in Slovakia, said that any delay in declaring independence would result in Slovakia being divided between Hungary and Germany. Under these circumstances, Parliament unanimously declared Slovak independence, thus creating the first Slovak state in history. Jozef Tiso was appointed the first Prime Minister of the new republic. The next day, Tiso sent a telegram (which had actually been composed the previous day in Berlin) asking the Reich to take over the protection of the newly minted state. The request was readily accepted.|$|E
25|$|At one point, {{both the}} German {{government}} and the German Air Force had been keen to relocate pilot training activities from the United States to France {{as part of the}} project. In 1971, however, this was abandoned over fears of a hostile US reaction and West Germany's offset obligations to the United States <b>making</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> move unpalatable. While the joint Franco-German training proposal was abandoned, the German government felt obligated to proceed with the aircraft program; at the time, Germany did not require a new trainer aircraft, but it did have a need for a replacement for its fleet of Fiat G.91 attack aircraft. Accordingly, Germany proposed that the aircraft be built in two distinct versions, as an inexpensive trainer for the French requirement, and as a close air support platform for the German requirement; this position was accepted by France. An initial point of contention whether to use a French or American powerplant for the aircraft was also settled, with France agreeing to solely finance the development of the French-built Larzac engine while Germany agreed to adopt the same powerplant.|$|E
