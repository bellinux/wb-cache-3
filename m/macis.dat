40|$|Abstract. Erythropoietin (EPO) and the EPO {{receptor}} (EPO-R) {{have been}} implicated in solid tumors of the brain, breast, kidney and female genital tract. Based on their expression {{by a variety of}} tumors, we hypothesized that EPO and/or EPO-R might be expressed by thyroid cancers. To test this, we determined EPO and EPO-R expression by immunohistochemistry in 17 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) from children and adolescents. Only a minority of PTC (4 / 17, 24 %) expressed EPO, and {{there were no significant differences}} between the PTC that did or did not express EPO. In contrast, EPO-R was detected in the majority of PTC (11 / 17, 65 %). The average tumor size (1. 5 ± 0. 8 cm), <b>MACIS</b> score (3. 6 ± 0. 2) and risk of recurrence (0 / 11) for the EPO-R(+) PTC were significantly less than those for PTC that failed to express EPO-R (average tumor size = 3. 6 ± 2. 4 cm, p = 0. 021; average <b>MACIS</b> score = 4. 3 ± 0. 7, p = 0. 004; recurrence = 3 / 6, p = 0. 029).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{find out}} the most {{predictive}} staging system for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) currently available in the literature. BACKGROUND: Various staging systems or risk group stratifications have been used extensively in the clinical management of patients with PTC, but the most predictive system for cancer-specific survival (CSS) based on distinct histologic types remains unclear. METHODS: Through a comprehensive MEDLINE search from 1965 to 2005, a total of 17 staging systems {{were found in the}} literature and 14 systems were applied to the 589 PTC patients managed at our institution from 1961 to 2001. CSS were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and were compared by log-rank test. Using Cox proportional hazards analysis, the relative importance of each staging system in determining CSS was calculated by the proportion of variation (PVE). RESULTS: All 14 staging systems significantly predicted CSS (P < 0. 001). The 3 highest ranked staging systems by PVE were the Metastases, Age, Completeness of Resection, Invasion, Size (<b>MACIS)</b> (18. 7) followed by the new AJCC/UICC 6 th edition tumor, node, metastases (TNM) (17. 9), and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) (16. 6). CONCLUSIONS: All of the currently available staging systems predicted CSS well in patients with PTC regardless of which histologic type from which they were derived. When predictability was measured by PVE, the <b>MACIS</b> system was the most predictive staging system and so should be the staging system of choice for PTC in the future. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of staging {{systems for the}} determination of prognosis of well-differentiated thyroid cancer Objective: In this study, we aimed to determine {{the significance of the}} staging systems (EORTC, De Groot, <b>MACIS,</b> and TNM) on the prognosis of well-differentiated thyroid cancer patients who underwent surgery in our clinics. Material and Methods: This retrospective study included 181 patients who were operated between December 1995 -December 2007, with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer. In order to obtain data related to cancer staging, a com-puter program for PDA was developed to facilitate parameter recording. Survival analysis was performed. The find-ings were compared to the predicted rates by the staging systems. Results: According to the De Groot staging system, stage 1 and stage 2 patients ’ results were compatible, but stage 3 and 4 patients ’ results were different (stage 3; 87 % versus 66. 6 %, stage 4; 35 % versus 100 %, p= 0. 04). In the <b>MACIS</b> staging system, 20 -year survival rates are determined and comparison should not be made due to insufficient follow-up period in this study. When compared to the EORTC staging system, stage 3 and stage 4 patients ’ results were determined different (stage 3; 51 % versus 100 %, stage 4; 33 % versus 50 %, p= 0. 02). The most consistent results in terms of prognosis was determined in comparison with the TNM staging system (stage 1; 100 % versus 97. 8 %, stage 4; 45. 3 % versus 50 %). Conclusion: Many classification systems are proposed for well-differentiated thyroid cancer, to predict the behavior of the tumor. In this study, we concluded that for determination of prognosis in well-differentiated thyroid cancer, the TNM staging system could best predict prognosis consistent with clinical findings.

The problem addressed by this research has both equity and efficiency aspects. In particular, the thesis examines the impact of telecentres on the formal and non-formal education outcomes of recipient communities - four telecentres, two in townships and two in rural areas. The urban telecentres are Siyabonga in Orange Farm near Johannesburg and Mamelodi Communication and Information Services (<b>MACIS),</b> in Mamelodi township, near Pretoria in Gauteng Province. The rural telecentres are Tombo near Port St Johns in the Eastern Cape Province and Hoxani near Bushbuckridge on the Mpumalanga-Limpopo Province border. The main {{aim of the research}} is to conduct a quantitative survey of the telecentre users’ use of telecentres in the above mentioned locations. On the basis of this, the thesis seeks to come to some conclusions about the use and effectiveness of the South African telecentre program. The quantitative analysis of users is supported by a qualitative report and analysis of data gathered through personal interviews of telecentre operators and employees. The thesis reports on the outputs of the centres, limitations in their function, inhibitors to their economic performance, and recommendations for improving their operations. Some of the findings are that telecentres established through public-private partnership (PPP) funding are more effective and successful, computer literacy is a major resource offered, Hoxani telecentre offers outcomes-based education management skills training for local teachers, while Tombo, <b>MACIS</b> and Siyabonga telecentres offer additional business and electronic courses.

40|$|Abstract Metabolic dysregulation {{within the}} tumor {{microenvironment}} (TME) {{is critical to}} the process of tumorigenesis in various cancer types. Thyrocyte metabolism in papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancer, however, remains poorly characterized, and studies analyzing the role of multicompartment metabolism in thyrocyte oncogenesis are sparse. We present a review of the current knowledge on cellular metabolism in non-cancerous and cancerous thyroid tissues, focusing on the monocarboxylate transporters MCT 1 and MCT 4, and on a transporter of the outer mitochondrial membrane TOMM 20. Understanding the metabolic phenotype of tumor cells and associated stromal cells in thyroid cancer can have profound implications on the use of biomarker staining in detecting subclinical cancer, imaging as it relates to expression of various transport proteins, and therapeutic interventions that manipulate this dysregulated tumor metabolism to halt tumorigenesis and eradicate the cancer. Future studies are required to confirm the prognostic significance of these biomarkers and their correlation with existing staging schemas such as the AGES, AMES, ATA and <b>MACIS</b> scoring systems..

40|$|Well-differentiated thyroid {{carcinoma}} (WDTC) {{represents the}} most common endocrine malignancy. Despite excellent prognoses exceeding 90 % in 10 -year follow-up, there are clinically controversial issues. One of these is extrathyroidal tumour extension invading recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN). The spread outside of the thyroid parenchyma and invasion to the surrounding structures, classified as always T 4 a, {{are the most important}} negative prognostic factor for the WDTC.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} years, {{the field of}} {{non-linear}} Computational Geometry has produced very relevant algorithmic advances, for instance, by adapting to low-degree curved objects techniques dealing with linear primitives. Moreover {{the introduction of new}} algorithms and approaches for dealing efficiently with curves and surfaces has shown a considerable impact in fields such as Computer-Aided Design where final users are continuously demanding more efficiency, accuracy, robustness, etc. New approaches for solving geometric problems, coming from Computer-Aided Geometric Design and involving curves and surfaces with a Computational Geometry flavour is the main focus of this special issue. Contributions were asked in areas such as: arrangements of low degree curves and surfaces; Voronoi diagrams and medial axes involving curved ob jects; offset computations and their topology; distance predicates for curves and surfaces; closed formulae for geometric queries involving curves and surfaces; intersection detection for moving curved ob jects; adapting algebraic or geometrical techniques for solving algorithmic problems involving curves and surfaces. This special issue is a direct consequence of the Second International Conference on Mathematical Aspects of Computer and Information Sciences - <b>MACIS</b> 2007 (see [URL] www- spiral. lip 6. fr/ <b>MACIS</b> 2007) held in Paris in December 2007 and where Computational Geometry and Computer Aided Geometric Design were one of the main topics (among other two, Polynomial System Solving and Algorithms and Complexity). Finally six papers (out of eight papers submitted by the March 2009 deadline) were finally accepted. The two papers by C. D'Andrea et al. and I. Z. Emiris et al. deal with the problem of analyzing the Newton polygon of the implicit equation of a rational curve starting from its parameterization: both papers are devoted to study from different viewpoints the properties of the set of monomials appearing in the implicit equation of the considered curve without computing it. The two papers by E. Berberich et al. introduce a new approach {{to deal with the problem}} of determining the shape of an arrangement of curves on several classes of parametric surfaces which is then applied to compute, for example, the Minkowski sum of polytopes or the envelope of surfaces.

Review of clinical data of 67 patients (54 women, 13 men) prospectively stored in a standardised way in an electronic patient record system. Results. There were 36 cases of microcarcinoma (53. 7 %). Differences were not significant between PTM and LPTC groups as to patients personal data, TNM and <b>MACIS</b> staging, nodal involvement (8. 3 % vs 19. 3 %) and multifocality (25 % vs 38. 7 %) while capsular invasion was significantly higher in LPTC (25 % vs 54. 8 %).

Patients and methods A retrospective cohort study of patients with WDTC treated at our institution between 1989 and 1991 (n 097; mean age 52. 3 years, 78 females, follow-up 124. 6 ± 75. 1 months) was made. Multivariate analysis was performed including: age, gender, size of pri-mary tumor, location and number of foci in thyroid tissue, clinical stage, thyroid capsule infiltration, tumor histological type, extent of surgery, prognosis based on the AGES and <b>MACIS</b> scores, and tumor proliferative activity based on determination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki- 67 expression in tumor tissue and nodal metastases. Results The multivariate analysis showed increased relative risk (RR) of death for: age above 60 years (7. 39; p< 0. 001), pTm (2. 94; p 00. 002), pT 3 (11. 83; p< 0. 001), and pN 1 (4. 11; p< 0. 001). Total thyroidectomy decreased RR of death (0. 39; p 00. 023) when compared to more limited resections. Moderate and high PCNA index was associated with 48. 3 % and 87. 5 % mortality, respectively, while Ki- 67 index was associated with the highest mortality rate (76 %) in the group of medium values.

Plant nutrient concentration in leaf, rind, flesh and seed were significantly affected by rootstocks. Increase in concentration of N, P, K, Ca and Mg in leaves was not observed in grafted plant. Ungrafted plant had higher concentration of Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu in their leaves. Ca concentration in rind of fruits from grafted watermelon was higher than ungrafted control plant except Crimson Tide/Macis and   Crimson Tide/Argentario graft combinations. Plant nutrition content of fruit flesh was significantly affected by rootstocks and scion. Magnesium, Fe, Zn and Mn concentration of seed was not significantly influenced by rootstocks and scion while other plant nutrient content was significantly affected rootstocks and scion. </p...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{follicular}} {{variant of}} papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) {{is the most}} common histologic subtype of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). However, it is still controversial whether FVPTC should behave differently from classical PTC (CPTC). The present study aimed at evaluating any potential difference in clinicopathologic features and long-term outcome of FVPTC as compared with CPTC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 568 patients with PTC managed from 1973 to 2004, 308 were shown to have CPTC (54. 2 %) and 67 (11. 8 %) FVPTC after histologic review. The mean (+/- SD) follow-up period was 11. 3 (+/- 8. 9) years. The two groups were compared in terms of clinicopathological features, treatment received, and outcome regarding recurrence and disease-specific survival. RESULTS: There was no difference in age and gender ratio between the CPTC and FVPTC patients. Both groups had similar tumor characteristics in terms of tumor size, presence of multifocality, capsular invasion, lymphovascular permeation, and perineural infiltration. However, FVPTC patients had significantly fewer histologically confirmed cervical lymph node metastases (P = 0. 027) and extrathyroidal involvement (P = 0. 005). The proportion of bilateral resection, adjuvant radioactive iodine, and lymph node dissection did not differ significantly between the two groups. The FVPTC patients had a more favorable tumor risk by DeGroot classification (P = 0. 003) and <b>MACIS</b> (Metastasis, Age, Completeness of excision, Invasiveness, and Size) score (P = 0. 026). The 10 - and 15 -year actuarial disease-specific survivals did not differ significantly between FVPTC and CPTC patients (96. 2 % versus 90. 7 % and 96. 2 % versus 89. 1 %, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although patients with FVPTC had more favorable clinicopathologic features and a better tumor risk group profile, their long-term outcome was similar to that of CPTC patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
