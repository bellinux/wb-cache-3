40|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>dusting</b> is {{a catastrophic}} {{carburisation}} phenomenon that occurs at temperatures of 450 - 850 °C in atmospheres of high carbon activity. The resistance of alloys to corrosion, including <b>metal</b> <b>dusting,</b> {{relies on the}} formation of a dense, adherent oxide layer that separates the alloy from the corrosive environment. For such an oxide layer to be protective, it must achieve full surface coverage, be crack-free and be established before significant material degradation has occurred. Formation of a protective oxide scale can be enhanced by increasing the population of rapid diffusion paths for the protective elements (e. g. Cr and Al) to reach the alloy surface. In this work, laser surface melting has been used to improve the <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> resistance of Alloy 800 H by creating a rapid solidification microstructure and, thereby, increasing the density of rapid diffusion paths.

40|$|The primary {{intention}} {{with this}} Doctoral thesis is to fillin the knowledge gaps {{and raise the}} level of understandingregarding the different <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> mechanisms in general andexplain the process in detail for high alloyed materials. Considerable effort is put into identifying the driving forcesand elucidating the diffusional processes in <b>metal</b> <b>dusting.</b> The results are based on a series of long-term laboratory exposures of stainless steels and high-performance commercial alumina-forming Fe- and Ni-base alloys in synthesis gasmixtures, plus a separate shorter study on ultra pure iron. ANi-base alloy was also investigated after a two years field exposure in a methanol plant. Post exposure metallographic examinations and analysis aswell as thermodynamic calculations were made in order toidentify and describe the operating <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> mechanisms. Two main mechanisms were previously used to explain metaldusting, one on the basis of decomposition of metastable carbides (Type I) the other on graphite formation (TypeII). A new <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> mechanism has been identified in this Thesis which appears on high alloyed steels and Ni-base alloys,an active corrosion induced by carbon and oxygen, denoted TypeIII. Both the mechanisms and the type of corrosion products were consistent with the thermodynamic conditions of the material under the influence of a carbon and oxygen gradient. It was shown that this mechanism not only accelerates the metaldusting process, in fact, it determines the overall metaldusting kinetics on stainless steels and Ni-base alloys. Another feature, which may occur at temperatures where metalbulk and even static grain boundary diffusion is too slow forexplaining the <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> corrosion process, was identifiedon a Ni-base alloy.

A full job history could be obtained for 95 % of the subjects. The cohort was followed up from January 1968  to December 1992.  The exposure was assessed by an industry specific job exposure matrix (JEM) characterising exposure to hard <b>metal</b> <b>dust</b> from 1  to 9  and other possibly carcinogenic exposures as present or absent. Smoking information was obtained by interview of former workers. Standard lifetable methods and Poisson regression were used for the statistical analysis of the data.  RESULTS—Mortality from all causes was close to the expected (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 1. 02,  399  deaths) whereas mortality from lung cancer was significantly increased among men (SMR 1. 70; 46  deaths, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 24  to 2. 26). By workshop, lung cancer mortality was significantly higher than expected in hard metal production before sintering (SMR 2. 42; nine deaths; 95 %CI 1. 10  to 4. 59) and among maintenance workers (SMR 2. 56; 11  deaths; 95 %CI 1. 28  to 4. 59), whereas after sintering the SMR was lower (SMR 1. 28; five deaths; 95 %CI 0. 41  to 2. 98). The SMR for all exposures to hard <b>metal</b> <b>dust</b> at a level > 1 in the JEM was in significant excess (SMR 2. 02; 26  deaths; 95 %CI 1. 32  to 2. 96). The risks increased with exposure scores, duration of exposure, and cumulative dose reaching significance for duration of exposure to hard <b>metal</b> <b>dust</b> before sintering, after adjustment for smoking and known or suspected carcinogens.  CONCLUSION—Excess mortality from lung cancer was found among hard metal production workers which cannot be attributed to smoking alone.

Occupational exposure to anaesthetic gases was associated with spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation among nurses and physicians. Chemotherapy agents were associated with spontaneous abortion among nurses. There was moderate to substantial heterogeneity in the studied relations. In the FHCPS, singleton newborns of nurses have increased risk of low birth weight, post-term delivery, and small-for-gestational-age compared to those of teachers (reference group). Maternal employment as a midwife was not related to adverse pregnancy outcomes. The risk of high birth weight and post-term delivery were lower among singleton newborns of the physicians compared to those of other upper-level employees (reference group), but the risk of SGA and LGA did not differ between the newborns of physicians and those of the reference group. In the FPEHS, paternal exposure to welding fumes only was related to small-for-gestational-age. Maternal exposure to <b>metal</b> <b>dust</b> only was related to low birth weight and pre-term delivery and the joint effect of welding fumes and <b>metal</b> <b>dust</b> was related to small-for-gestational age.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} carburising furnace {{in which}} <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> conditions are simulated {{has been designed}} and constructed. This furnace {{has been used to}} simulate and study the <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> corrosion of four iron-based alloys viz. 9 Cr Mo 45 steel, Incoloy 800 H, AISI 310 stainless steel and Chromanite - an experimental high-nitrogen Cr-Mn stainless steel (HNSS). Tests conducted on the carburising furnace show that the rig is capable of heating a flowing gas environment to temperatures of 800 °C in the horizontal ceramic tube. The design allows the testing of up to thirty-six test specimens in a constanttemperature test zone. Systems for the safe heating and disposal of gases such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide have been incorporated into the design. Four twenty-four hour exposures were performed on specimens of the CrMo steel and as received samples of AISI 310. This was followed by a series of seven week-long exposures of Incoloy 800 H, AISI 310 and the high nitrogen stainless steel (HNSS). These specimens were tested in an annealed and polished condition in order to increase their susceptibility to <b>metal</b> <b>dusting.</b> In a third test series, specimens of these three alloys were tested in an annealed and abraded condition {{in order to determine the}} effect of grain size and surface roughness on <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> resistance. Exposures of the CrMo specimens resulted in general metal loss and massive carbon deposition after the first exposure of 24 hours. Filamentous carbon deposits containing metal particles showed that <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> corrosion of the specimens had taken place. The as received AISI 310 specimens showed no signs of <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> attack over the same exposure time. This was attributed to a protective surface chromia layer that prevented carburisation of the specimens. During the second test series, specimens of Incoloy 800 H in the sensitised condition showed a high susceptibility to <b>metal</b> <b>dusting.</b> Carburisation of the matrix carburisation was accompanied by large carbon protrusions growing from the specimens' surfaces. Large pits were observed on the specimens after five weeks. Sensitised AISI 310 specimens also showed signs of <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> but at a slower rate. The difference in performance between these two alloys was attributed to the difference in alloying contents, notably chromium, nickel and silicon. The HNSS specimens showed a high resistance to carburisation, carbon deposition and metal loss during the first six weeks. Small amounts of carbon deposition and pitting were observed after the seventh exposure. The good resistance to <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> of this alloy was attributed to its alloying contents, which included chromium, manganese, sulphur and nitrogen. The results of the third test senes showed that resistance to <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> was significantly improved by increasing the surface roughness and decreasing the grain size of the specimens.

40|$|The {{deposition}} of carbon from carbonaceous gaseous environments is prevalent in many chemical and petrochemical processes such as, hydrogen-, ammonia-, and methanol-reforming systems, syngas production systems, and iron-ore reduction plants. One {{of the major}} consequences of carbon deposition is the degradation of structural materials by a phenomenon known as ''metal dusting''. There are two major issues of importance in <b>metal</b> <b>dusting.</b> First is formation of coke and subsequent {{deposition of}} coke on metallic structural components. Second is the initiation and subsequent propagation of <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> degradation of the structural alloy. In the past, we reported on the mechanism for <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> of Fe- and Ni-base alloys. In this report, we present <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> data on both Fe- and Ni-base alloys after exposure in high and atmospheric pressure environments that simulate the gas chemistry in operating hydrogen reformers. We have also measured the progression of pits by measuring the depth {{as a function of}} exposure time for a variety of Fe- and Ni-base structural alloys. We have clearly established the role of transport of iron in forming a non-protective spinel phase in the initiation process and presence of carbon transfer channels in the oxide scale for the continued propagation of pits, by nano-beam X-ray analysis using the advance photon source (APS), Raman scattering, and SEM/EDX analysis. In this report, we have developed correlations between weight loss and pit progression rates and evaluated the effects of carbon activity, system pressure, and alloy chemistry, on weight loss and pit propagation. To develop pit propagation data for the alloys without incurring substantial time for the initiation of pits, especially for the Ni-base alloys that exhibit incubation times of thousands of hours, a pre-pitting method has been developed. The pre-pitted alloys exhibited pit propagation rates similar to those of materials tested without pre-pitting. We have also developed a substantial body of metal-dusting data on the performance of Fe- and Ni-base weldments. During the course of this project, we have developed new Ni-base and Cu-base alloys and tested them in simulated <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> environments at 1 atm and at high pressures.

40|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>dusting</b> {{leads to}} {{disintegration}} of such alloys as iron and nickel-based into a “dust” of particulate metal, metal carbide, carbon, and/or oxide. It occurs in strongly carburising environments at 400 - 900 °C. Literature survey {{has shown that}} alloys behave differently in <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> conditions based on their composition and the environment. <b>Metal</b> <b>dusting</b> mechanisms for iron and nickel-based alloys have been proposed but, nevertheless, have not been agreed upon and numerous modifications to them have been suggested. Further adding to the complexity, the mechanisms {{were found to have}} differed due to operating condition alterations. In view of that, this research was carried out {{to gain a better understanding}} of <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> process(s) by evaluating the performance of heat-resistant alloys, namely KHR 35 C HiSi© (HP), KHR 45 A LC© (35 Cr- 45 Ni), and UCX©, in <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> conditions. HP, which is an iron-based alloy, was modified by adding more silicon in order to improve its resistance through the development of SiO 2 at the surface. The carbon content in the nickel-based alloy, 35 Cr- 45 Ni, was lowered to delay the attack onset by accommodating more diffused carbon. UCX©, however, has the highest nickel and chromium levels. The alloys were exposed to a gas containing 80 vol% CO+ 20 vol% H 2 at 650, 750, and 850 ºC for 100, 500, and 1000 h. Analyses including visual inspection, XRD, and SEM/EDX revealed that the alloys suffered localised attacks at the three temperatures but to varying degrees and in different shapes. In general, the attack initiated at the matrix rather than the primary carbides and also progressed through the matrix. Increasing the exposure temperature caused less carbon deposition and more oxides formation on the alloy surfaces leading to a reduction in the attack aggressiveness. UCX© exhibited the highest resistance to <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> whilst HP suffered the severest attack. The presence of high concentrations of chromium at the surface catalysed a quick formation of Cr 2 O 3 scale that reduced the extent of <b>metal</b> <b>dusting.</b> Also, the increase in nickel content might have slowed down the carbon diffusion into the alloy. In addition, the presence of other oxide and carbide-forming elements such as silicon and tungsten might well have enhanced the alloy performance. Diffused carbon binds with free tungsten, niobium, and chromium to form carbides prolonging the incubation period prior to the attack initiation.

40|$|Phenomena of <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> on {{iron and}} nickel (and their alloys) were studied by characterizing both {{microstructure}} and nanochem-istry {{of the reaction}} zones using TEM and AEM techniques. While in case of iron a metastable carbide (cementite) is formed nickel directly disintegrates. In the chromium-rich steel HK 40 and the chromium-rich Ni-base alloy Inconel 600 some microstructural chromium dependent features were observed with protective ef-fects against <b>metal</b> <b>dusting.</b> Independent of these differences, in all groups of materials a fundamental common starting mechanism on the atomic scale could be deduced, which first of all comprises the arrangement of basal graphite lattice planes perpendicularly oriented to the carbide (or metal) surface acting as active sites in the disintegration process. Unter Verwendung von TEM- und AEM-Techniken wurden so-wohl die Mikrostruktur als auch die Nanochemie der beim <b>Metal</b> <b>Dusting</b> von Eisen und Nickel (und deren Legierungen) auftreten-den Reaktionszonen charakterisiert.

40|$|Influence {{of thermal}} {{radiation}} emissivity on {{the lifetime of}} a dust particle in plasmas is investigated for different fusion relevant metals (Li, Be, Mo, and W). The thermal radiation is one of main cooling mechanisms of the dust in plasmas especially for dust with evaporation temperature higher than 2500 K. In this paper, the temperature- and radius-dependent emissivity of dust particles is calculated using Mie theory and temperature-dependent optical constants for the above metallic materials. The lifetime of a dust particle in uniform plasmas is estimated with the calculated emissivity using the dust transport code DUSTT [A. Pigarov, Physics of Plasmas 12, 122508 (2005) ], considering other dust cooling and destruction processes such as physical and chemical sputtering, melting and evaporation, electron emission etc. The use of temperature-dependent emissivity calculated with Mie theory provides a longer lifetime of the refractory <b>metal</b> <b>dust</b> particle compared with that obtained using conventional emissivity constants in the literature. The dynamics of heavy <b>metal</b> <b>dust</b> particles are also presented using the calculated emissivity in a tokamak plasma. © 2008 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|In the industry, the {{potential}} for exposure to cobalt <b>metal</b> <b>dust</b> is particularly important during the production of cobalt powder and the processing and use of hard metals and other cobalt-containing alloys. The different adverse health effects reported in these workers are reviewed. One of the main target organs is the respiratory tract, and this article concentrates on the lung parenchymal reactions induced by cobalt-containing dust. Clinical and epidemiological data indicate that this manifestation is rarely, if ever, induced by pure cobalt <b>metal</b> <b>dust</b> alone, but requires the concomitant inhalation of other compounds such as tungsten carbide in the hard metal industry (hard metal disease). Experimental studies demonstrate that cobalt metal and metallic carbides interact to produce an elective lung toxicity. Recent work on the mechanism of this interaction, {{which is based on}} the production of activated oxygen species, is reviewed. A practical implication in industrial hygiene should be that permissible exposure levels to Co dust might have to be different when exposure is to pure Co particles or an association with carbides...|$|R
