5|$|In early 1920, {{the first}} Jewish-Arab {{dispute over the}} Wall {{occurred}} when the Muslim authorities were carrying out <b>minor</b> <b>repair</b> works to the Wall’s upper courses. The Jews, while agreeing that the works were necessary, appealed to the British that they be made under supervision of the newly formed Department of Antiquities, because the Wall was an ancient relic.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, it became {{apparent}} that the facilities at Hampden were in need of renewal. As an amateur club, Queen's Park could not possibly fund the works, while Glasgow District Council withdrew funding and the UK Government decided not to fund it either. Queen's Park considered selling Hampden, but a public appeal and <b>minor</b> <b>repair</b> work kept Hampden open during the 1980s. The riot after the 1980 Scottish Cup Final prompted reforms, as alcohol was banned from football stadia in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Repairs to Tirpitz {{were carried}} out using improvised {{facilities}} at Kaafjord as it was considered too risky to attempt to move the damaged warship to Germany. Instead, equipment and work crews were shipped to the fjord from German ports. On the night of 10/11 February 1944, 15 Soviet aircraft attacked the battleship, but did not cause any damage. By 17 March, the repairs to Tirpitzs armament, machinery and hull were complete, but several <b>minor</b> <b>repair</b> tasks were outstanding. During the period the ship was under repair, Scharnhorst, the only remaining operational German battleship, was sunk on 26 December during the Battle of the North Cape. Following this engagement the Royal Navy stopped deploying battleships to cover convoys travelling {{to and from the}} Soviet Union. By this stage of the war the Allies also had large numbers of anti-submarine and anti-aircraft escort ships available, and were able to assign strong forces to protect all of the Arctic convoys. German submarines operating in the Norwegian Sea were rarely able to evade the convoy escorts, and few merchant vessels suffered damage from enemy attack.|$|E

25|$|In 1846, Samuel Enderby's {{grandson}} Charles Enderby {{founded the}} Southern Whale Fishery Company in England. In December 1849, he established the Enderby Settlement in Erebus Cove, Port Ross, at the north-eastern end of Auckland Island, close to Enderby Island. This {{was the beginning}} of the community named Hardwicke. The Hardwicke settlement was based on agriculture, resupply and <b>minor</b> <b>repair</b> of ships, and whaling. Ultimately unsuccessful, the colony was abandoned in August 1852.|$|E

Gacy had quit {{his job as a}} cook and started his own construction business, PDM Contractors (PDM being the initials for 'Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance'). The business initially undertook <b>minor</b> <b>repair</b> work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, remodeling, installation, assembly, and landscaping. By 1978, the gross of PDM's annual turnover was over $200,000.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the course}} of construction, a number of {{problems}} came up, including structural issues, a shortage of manpower, and the disobedience of workers. Excavation of the ditches and the initial stages of construction were largely complete by June 1752, and work on the fort proper began in October of the same year. The fort was almost ready by 1757, and it was fully completed in the early 1760s. The fort quickly fell into disrepair, being described as a ruin in 1789. Some <b>minor</b> <b>repair</b> works were carried out in 1796.|$|E
25|$|Burnaby Transit Centre: Located at 3855 Kitchener Street, Burnaby, it {{was built}} in 1986, this transit centre is split into two {{facilities}} separated by Kitchener Street. Serving parts of Burnaby and New Westminster, as well the North Shore and east Vancouver, Burnaby Transit Centre is also home to many support services such as Environmental Services, Trolley Overhead, Facilities Maintenance, Fire Prevention, and Non-Revenue Vehicle Maintenance. Beginning in September 2016, North Shore transit routes operate out of this transit centre. Fleet Overhaul at this location is where the majority of body repair and repainting is carried out, as well as engine and component overhaul, while <b>minor</b> <b>repair</b> is most likely carried out at the bus's home garage.

25|$|After the {{two large}} freight ships were {{completed}} the workload went down. There were no new orders for new ships or rolling stock. In 1923 the company got two notable projects: {{one of them}} was a <b>minor</b> <b>repair</b> project of a shipwrecked merchant ship. The other one was for completing a semi-finished icebreaker, which had been started at Boecker & Co. shipyard in Tallinn. The Finnish state needed new icebreakers to ensure year-round access to its harbours, and had purchased the hull via John Nurminen company. The icebreaker was named Voima and completed and handed over to the state in 1924. The project was challenging, but the outcome was excellent; it demonstated the company's capability to undertake demanding projects. However, after these projects the company suffered again lack of work. Due to the poor situation, the company had to discontinue the lease contract for the new shipbuilding area and sell the buildings and equipment.|$|E
