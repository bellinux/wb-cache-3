500|$|To {{treat these}} conditions, Jackson used Solaquin, Tretinoin, and Benoquin. On June 29, 2009, {{multiple}} tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone {{were found in}} Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with vitiligo {{get to the point}} where it <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> remove the brown bits because so much of the skin is pale. On the other hand, getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult. Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. Vitiligo patients are at risk to contract melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also had hydroxychloroquine injected directly into his scalp regularly. Another common way of treating vitiligo is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and with the application of pancake makeup to even out his skin tone, he could appear very pale. For example, Stevie Nicks recalled in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I remember before , Michael sent somebody to find out if I had any foundation make-up he could borrow. I was using some light Chanel foundation at that time, and Michael sent back a note to say, thanks, but the foundation wasn't quite light enough for him." [...] Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for [...] "Remember the Time," [...] all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.|$|E

The Navy said the world threat picture had changed {{in such a way}} that it now <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> build at least eight more Burkes, rather than DDG-1000s. The Navy concluded from fifteen classified intelligence reports that the DDG-1000s would be vulnerable to forms of missile attacks. Many Congressional subcommittee members questioned that the Navy completed such a sweeping re-evaluation of the world threat picture in just a few weeks, after spending some 13 years and $10 billion on the development of the surface ship program known as DD-21, then DD(X), and finally DDG-1000. Subsequently, Chief of Naval Operations Gary Roughead cited the need to provide area air defense and specific new threats such as ballistic missiles and the possession of anti-ship missiles by groups such as Hezbollah. The mooted structural problems have not been discussed in public. Navy Secretary Donald Winter said on 4 September that [...] "Making certain that we have – I'll just say, a destroyer – in the '09 budget is more important than whether that’s a DDG 1000 or a DDG 51".|$|E
