40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to quantify the “antikeratinizing” effects of various retinoids (all-trans-retinoic acid, 13 -cis-retinoic acid, <b>motretinide,</b> etretinate) in rhino mouse skin, which contains many keratinized pilosebaceous structures or horn-filled utriculi. Mean utriculus diameters in whole mount epidermis were determined and dose-response relationships were constructed after topical or oral administration of test retinoids. All- trans-retinoic acid was 3. 7 ×, 12. 5 ×, and 50 × more potent than 13 -cis-retinoic acid, etretinate, and <b>motretinide,</b> respectively, after topical administration. Administered orally, all-trans-retinoic acid was 2. 3 × more potent than 13 -cis-retinoic acid At 5 mg/kg, each retinoid produced {{a significant reduction in}} utriculus size. The rhino mouse model represents a novel and useful assay to quantify antikeratinizing activity and potency differences of biologically active retinoids...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-The sc route {{was used}} to study the {{adjuvant}} effect of vitamin A palmitate (VA) and the retinoids isotretinoin (Ro 4 - 3780). etretinate (Ro 10 - 9359), and <b>motretinide</b> (Ro 11 - 1430) on cell-mediated immunity to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) in outbred Mai:NIH(S) mice. The immune response was quantified by a sensitive assay procedure in which the antigen is injected intracutaneously into the pinna of the mouse, and the subsequent inflammatory swelling is measured with calipers. A single simul-taneous injection of 150 ~g VA enhanced cell-mediated im-munity to SRBC as early as 3 days following immunization, and the enhancement persisted for at least 3 weeks. Administered as a single injection 1 day or more before or after SRBC or as an ip injection, VA was not effective. Single injections of 100 ~g isotretinoin and <b>motretinide</b> but not etretinate also enhanced the response. The effective agents possessed adjuvanticity com-parable in magnitude to that of Bordetella pertussis vaccine. -JNCI 1981; 67 : 1153 - 1156. VA {{and some of its}} naturally occurring or synthetic analogs or derivatives (retinoids) {{have been shown to be}} effective adjuvants; they were found to enhance humoral antibody to a variety of antigens (1 - 5) and to enhance certain CMI responses, such as accelerated skin homograft rejection (4, 6). However, more precise quantitation of their adjuvanticity on CMI has not received much attention. Their role in enhancement of CMI is of special significance because many of these substances are curently being used as antineoplastic agents in experimental tumor systems (7 - 11). These investigations have provided evidence suggesting that the effectiveness of retinoids in inhibiting tumor growth may be related, at least in part, to their ability to potentiate the CMI response of the host. In particular, the investigations of Glaser and Lotan (9) and Patek et a 1. (11) have shown that tumor growth could be inhibited by a population of cytotoxic T-cells that had been stimulated by the retinoid f 3 -all-trans-retinoic acid. It seemed of interest, therefore, to assay in a precise manner the enhancement of the CMI response induced by this class of adjuvants. In the present investigation, the adjuvant effects of VA and three of its derivative...|$|E
