40|$|This study {{reports on}} the effect of {{magnesium}} oxide, <b>magnesium</b> <b>trisilicate,</b> aluminium hydroxide and bentonite antacids on the disintegration and dissolution characteristics of commercial paracetamol and metronidazole tablets. The effect of salt on the interaction between the drugs and the antacids was also studied. The disintegration times of the tablets were determined in the different antacid solutions while the effect of antacids on dissolution was studied by adding various amounts of the antacid powders to the dissolution medium. The presence of <b>magnesium</b> <b>trisilicate,</b> magnesium oxide and bentonite delayed disintegration of paracetamol tablets. Generally, the introduction of 7. 5 % w/w sodium chloride into each of the antacid resulted in a reduction in disintegration time of paracetamol tablets. Combination of the antacids resulted in a greater retardation of dissolution of the paracetamol and metronidazole tablets. The retardation of dissolution of metronidazole from the tablets followed the rank order: bentonite> magnesium trisilicate> magnesium oxide> aluminium hydroxide. The addition of salt to <b>magnesium</b> <b>trisilicate</b> and bentonite dissolution medium decreased T 50 and T 70 with 7. 5 % w/w sodium chloride causing a greater reduction than 5. 0 % w/w. The results suggest that concomitant administration of magnesium oxide, magnessium trisilicate, aluminium hydroxide and bentonite with paracetamol and metronidazole should be discouraged since the bioavailability of these drugs may be compromised...|$|E

40|$|Both {{divinyl benzene}} {{copolymer}} (plastic) beads and schistosome eggs produce inflammatory reactions after intravenous deposition into the lung of a mouse. As reported previously, the schistosome egg granuloma is an immunologic {{reaction of the}} delayed hypersensitivity type; this inflammatory process is prevented by immunosuppressive measures, and characteristically demonstrates an anamnestic response. In contradistinction, the plastic bead granuloma appears to be characteristic of a foreign body reaction; it is unaffected by immunosuppressive measures and does not demonstrate an anamnestic response with repeated exposure. The data in this report suggest that the granuloma formation around plastic beads is a nonimmunologic reaction induced by chemical mediators of inflammation. This proposal {{is supported by the}} following findings: the plastic beads activate Hageman factor in normal human and mouse plasma; the plastic beads induce vascular permeability-enhancing activity as measured in guinea pig skin and kinin-like activity in normal human and mouse plasma that is dependent on Hageman factor; ellagic acid, an agent that activates Hageman factor in vivo and is reported to diminish kininogen by consumptive depletion, markedly depresses the plastic bead granuloma. These data are consistent with the idea that the plastic bead granuloma and perhaps other foreign body inflammatory reactions are in major part dependent on kinin formation. Ellagic acid also suppressed the schistosome egg granuloma, but not to the same degree as the plastic bead granuloma. The implications of this observation are discussed in the text. Silicosis and "blue velvet disease", pathologic processes associated with the deposition of silica and <b>magnesium</b> <b>trisilicate,</b> respectively, in the lung, and the induction of a foreign body reaction may also be dependent on the activation of chemical mediators of inflammation by the silica and <b>magnesium</b> <b>trisilicate</b> particles with immunologic mechanisms participating in only a minor way, if at all.

The reaction with Mg₂Si₃ 0 ₈· 5 H₂ 0 resulted in the formation of crystals of magnesium tris (catecholato) siliconate nonahydrate Mg[Si(Cat) ₃]∙ 9 H₂ 0. Dehydration of the crystals at room temperature resulted in the loss of 6 moles of water to form a trihydrated complex, Mg[Si(Cat) ₃]· 3 H₂ 0; further dehydration at 100 °C gave an anhydrous complex, Mg[Si(Cat) ₃]. By adding guanidine hydrochloride, CN₃H₆Cl, to the reaction mixture after filtering, crystals of guanidinium tris (catecholato) siliconate monohydrate, (CN₃H₆) ₂[Si(Cat) ₃]∙H₂ 0, were obtained. Infrared and nmr spectra, and analytical and x-ray powder diffraction data are presented. The possible structures of the magnesium salts of tris (catecholato) siliconate are also discussed.

40|$|Thesis (M. Pharm. (Pharmacy Practice)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. The South African {{national}} drug policy (NDP) was implemented in 1994 {{to ensure the}} availability and accessibility of essential drugs to all citizens. The NDP also hoped to ensure the safety, efficacy and quality of drugs {{as well as to}} promote the concepts of individual responsibility for health, preventative care and informed decision making. However, drug utilisation studies performed after the implementation of the {{national drug}} policy showed that South Africa's pharmaceutical sector was characterised by indiscriminate and irrational drug use, high drug prices and polypharmacy. A retrospective study that was done in 2001 in the clinics supplied by Evander Hospital showed that only 11. 9 % of prescriptions for acid-related disorders complied with the standard treatment guidelines (STG). It became evident that there was need for an intervention. The general objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of an education intervention, implemented in 2003, on the prescribing patterns of drugs for acid-related disorders in the Govan Mbeki municipal clinics serviced by Evander Hospital. An empirical pre-intervention and post-intervention study using primary data obtained from patient files at the clinics was done. A quantitative survey of the use of the drugs included in the study (<b>magnesium</b> <b>trisilicate,</b> aluminium hydroxide/magnesium trisilicate combination tablets, cimetidine or omeprazole) was conducted. To determine a baseline, all prescriptions where the drugs selected for this study were prescribed from 1 July 2001 to 31 December 2001 were collected. For the period I January 2002 to 31 December 2002 retrospective data was collected in the form of all prescriptions where the relevant drugs were prescribed. Additional retrospective data was collected for the period January 2002 to 30 June 2003 to determine the outcome of treatment given. The phi coefficient was calculated, and although statistical correlation could not be proven, important tendencies could be detected in the data. Only 8 % of the prescriptions adhered to the STG before the presentation of the face to face education intervention. In the first six months following the intervention, STG compliance increased to 15. 2 %. In the following six-month period, the STG compliance decreased to 14. 1 %. The assumption was made that patients were cured if they did not return with the same complaint. Based on this assumption the conclusion was drawn that, before the intervention, 50. 2 % of the patients were cured. In the first six months after the intervention had taken place the percentage patients who did not return increased from 50. 2 % to 60. 6 %. In the second six months after the intervention the percentage of patients who did not return increased to 70. 7 %. It may be concluded that compliance with the STG improved as a result of the face to face education intervention. Moreover, it was found that cost efficiency improved in parallel and the cure rate seemed to be positively affected by the intervention. Master...|$|E

In some cases the interaction can be of such a degree as to preclude the use of some excipients or to dramatically reduce the shelf life of the products. Thus there is clearly a need for techniques which can reduce or eliminate such interactions. Sometimes the irrational combination of two drugs or drug and excipient cause {{a decrease in the}} stability, bioavailability and efficacy of the dosage form 1. Microencapsulation can be considered as a tool to enhance the drug stability 2. It has generally been observed that microencapsulated products show a substantial reduction or elimination of the adverse effects of incompatibilities, although quantitative data on the extent of stabilization is not readily available in the published literarture. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine the drug interactions and incompatibilities between drugs and excipients which are widely used in pharmaceutical manufacturing and have some characteristic compatibility problems. I did these studies on powder mixes and compressed tablets owing to the fact that majority of the dosage forms are formulated in the solid state 3. The study included three drugs namely aspirin, acetaminophen and pseudoephedrine (hydrochloride salt). The {{interaction between}} aspirin and dibasic calcium phosphate (Emcompress) was studied in detail. Non-microencapsulated aspirin showed significant degradation by hydrolysis in presence of Emcompress at room temperature as well as elevated temperature. Microencapsulated aspirin showed a marked decrease in the degradation under same conditions. The stabilizing effect of the microencapsulation was both statistically significant and substantial. The interaction between acetaminophen (APAP) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride and phenylephrine hydrochloride was monitored for the presence of degradation products. These agents showed incompatibility with acetaminophen when used in the proportion which was the same as that of an over the counter product. The manifestation of incompatibility was melting point depression by eutectic formation. The eutectic formation was prevented when microencapsulated acetaminophen was used. Non-microencapsulated acetaminophen showed significant adsorption over antacids like aluminum hydroxide, <b>magnesium</b> <b>trisilicate</b> and calcium carbonate. Microencapsulated acetaminophen demonstrated appreciable decrease in the rate and extent of adsorption under similar conditions. I had planned the compatibility studies of pseudoephedrine HCI with hydrous lactose and with sodium metabisulphite. The literature showed evidence of some degradation products. However initial tests showed no significant compatibility problems and hence no further experimentation was performed on these substances. However the interaction of pseudoephedrine and acetaminophen and pseudoephedrine and aspirin was monitored for the degradation products. A battery of in process quality control tests such as appearance, weight variation, content uniformity, surface characters, flowability, friability, and moisture content were performed on all three formulations. All results were evaluated using conventional statistical techniques using factorial design and the differences between microencapsulated and non microencapsulated products were determined at 95...|$|E
40|$|Sity {{peptic ulcer}} {{patients}} diagnosed endoscopical 1 y or by barium meal or by both and 60 controls matched for {{age and sex}} but without abdominal problem were studied between May 17 th and November 22 nd 1982. The sources of patients were the gastroenterology clinic and proximal endoscopy sessions and that for the controls were the medical wards. The study was both descriptive and analytical. Medical characteristics and psycho social factor wore studied The information was collected by questionnaire an analyzed by TRS 80 computer and electronic calculating machine. In the analytical study the following were the results. The prevalence of peptic ulcer {{was positively correlated with}} education, social class, working-extra hours because of benefit derived from it, and death of one of the parents before 16 years. There Was however a. negative correlation with income, number of friends, contact with confident friends, number of reliable people to turn to in times of difficulty and active religious association. e rove were statistically significant at a level of p< 0. 05. Contrary to popular belief blood group and urbanization did not have any significant correlation. The descriptive study gave the following results. Most of the patients had duodenal ulcer, duodenal ulcer:gastric ulcer ratio 12. 75 : 1. There was a preponderance of males over females in a ratio of approximately 3 : 1. 	The mean age was 36 years 35. 79 years with a range of 15 to 72 years 65. 52 % of the patients had definite stressful events within six months before the onset of the disease (l. 1. d 31, 1 d positive family history of a simi 1 problem. 61., of patients presented with burning abdominal Painful followed by 15. 7 % who only had abdominal discomfort. 110 st of the pain wan felt in the epigastrium followed by umbilical and right hypochondrium (56. 9 %, 17. 25 % and 12. 07 % respectively). 	Hunger worsened the pain in 8 O%t in 43 % a big meal worsened the pain but a moderate amount of food relieved it, in 4 % any amount of food relieved the pain, in 17 % food had no effect and in 36 % food made the pain worse. ' Radiation of the pain Has inconclusive. 89 % had gradual mode of onset and 98 % had periodicity. Duration of the pain had a mean of 6. 22 years with a range of one week to 30 years. In approximately 50 % in each case of malaena or haematemesis there was a positive history. Vomiting did not occur in 37. 9 ~, h d no relationship with pain in 12. 07 %, relieved pain in 44. 83 f, and aggravated it in 5. 17 %. 45 % of the patients had epigastric tenderness, no tenderness in 36 % and the rest forming the remaining percentage. Only 291 had a positive history of ingestion of ingestion of asprin. Patients had three follow ups at the gastrointestinal clinic at an interval of three weeks each. The Patients were treated With anti-acid <b>magnesium</b> <b>trisilicate</b> antispasmodic sedative combination (belladona with phenobarbitone) one tablet of each When they felt pain. They were also advised to avoid alcohol and smoking and to take frequent milk and frequent moderate quantities of none iritant foods 84 % of patients (43 out of 58) who turned up during the first follow up. satisfactory relief and 93 % for those who turned up at all the three follow ups on the third follow up satisfactory relief here means some relief to definite relief. It is recommended that dyspepsi clinic be established in peripheral hospitals and to start with Dar es Salaam and manage Patients along the above lines and this 11 i 11 help to enable patients get proper follow up and lessen the time 'lasted in moving from hospital to the other. A further study is indica. ted to make an index of score based on t e above findings to determine a score will be used to diagnose peptic ulcer in the majority r of our hospitals where we dont have personnel (equipment for either barium meals n or proximal endoscopies. It is further suggested that since this study touches crudely on the management of peptic ulcer, a subject whose known and unknown knowledge is very vast and further studies are indicated on this. It might prove cheaper to treat patients with, definitely active duodenal ulcer with oimetidine than the conventional methods being used now if you consider that the patients will be able to return to his job earlier. But this needs to be studied to arrive at any conclusion...|$|E
