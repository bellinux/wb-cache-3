40|$|Sleep {{has been}} implicated in the plastic {{cerebral}} changes that underlie learning and <b>memory.</b> <b>Indications</b> that sleep participates in the consolida-tion of fresh memory traces come {{from a wide range}} of experimental observations. At the network level, reactivations during sleep of neuronal assemblies recently challenged by new environmental circumstances have been reported in different experimental designs. These neuronal assem-blies are proposed to be involved in the processing of memory traces during sleep. However, despite this rapidly growing body of experimental data, evidence for the inßuence of sleep discharge patterns on memory traces remains fragmentary. The underlying role of sleep in learning and memory has yet to be precisely characterized. There are two main types of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, also known as par-adoxical sleep (PS), and non-REM sleep, hereafter referred to as slow wave slee...|$|R

The play might have been for Toni Kukoč to shoot a three. With the series shifting back to Utah with a far more generous 3-2 Bulls advantage, the promise of another Chicago championship was not so certain.|$|R

Karl Malone had his best game of the series, scoring 39 points. Antoine Carr made all 5 of his field goal attempts, mainly on 20-foot jumpers in the second half. With the series shifting back to Utah with a 3-2 Bulls lead, the promise of another Chicago championship wasn't so certain.|$|R
40|$|The {{observation}} of a contemporary occurrence {{led to the}} reconsideration of the thesis that Umbanda reflects historical processes and holds deep social <b>memories.</b> There are <b>indications</b> that such resource {{has been applied to}} the reflection of childhood abandonment, guiding care taking and solidarity practices that retribute the talents attributed to child "street people", based on the recognition of their participation and their "mystic" insertion in the social life. This article aims at analyzing ritual performances of "Little Eshuses" and statements of these umbandist pantheon's characters and of their followers. It is supposed that lending an ear to these collective meditations and to the way they reflect the short circuit between the excluding society and the childhood ferocity contributes to the understanding of how the sectors which most give away their lives to such horror interpret it and signify to themselves. It is concluded that Umbanda thwarts segregation and extermination - both physical and symbolic - of those children by means of their deep inclusion in the heart of religious experience...|$|R
40|$|Postlingually {{acquired}} {{hearing impairment}} (HI) {{is associated with}} changes in the representation of sound in semantic long-term <b>memory.</b> An <b>indication</b> {{of this is the}} lower performance on visual rhyme judgment tasks in conditions where phonological and orthographic cues mismatch, requiring high reliance on phonological representations. In this study, event-related potentials (ERPs) were used {{for the first time to}} investigate the neural correlates of phonological processing in visual rhyme judgments in participants with acquired HI and normal hearing (NH). Rhyme task word pairs rhymed or not and had matching or mismatching orthography. In addition, the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) was manipulated to be either long (800 ms) or short (50 ms). Long ISIs allow for engagement of explicit, top-down processes, while short ISIs limit the involvement of such mechanisms. We hypothesized lower behavioral performance and N 400 and N 2 deviations in HI in the mismatching rhyme judgment conditions, particularly in short ISI. However, the results showed a different pattern. As expected, behavioral performance in the mismatch conditions was lower in HI than in NH in short ISI, but ERPs did not differ across groups. In contrast, HI performed on a par with NH in long ISI. Further, HI, but not NH, showed an amplified N 2 -like response in the non-rhyming, orthographically mismatching condition in long ISI. This was also the rhyme condition in which participants in both groups benefited the most from the possibility to engage top-down processes afforded with the longer ISI. Taken together, these results indicate an early ERP signature of HI in this challenging phonological task, likely reflecting use of a compensatory strategy. This strategy is suggested to involve increased reliance on explicit mechanisms such as articulatory recoding and grapheme-to-phoneme conversion...|$|R
40|$|The progeny of T {{lymphocytes}} {{responding to}} immunization mostly die rapidly, leaving a few long-lived survivors functioning as immune memory. Thus, {{control of this}} choice of death versus survival is critical for immune <b>memory.</b> There are <b>indications</b> that reactive radicals {{may be involved in}} this death pathway. We now show that, in mice lacking inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), higher frequencies of both CD 4 and CD 8 memory T cells persist in response to immunization, even when iNOS+/+ APCs are used for immunization. Postactivation T cell death by neglect is reduced in iNOS–/– T cells, and levels of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl- 2 and Bcl-xL are increased. Inhibitors of the iNOS-peroxynitrite pathway also enhance memory responses and block postactivation death by neglect in both mouse and human T cells. However, early primary immune responses are not enhanced, which suggests that altered survival, rather than enhanced activation, is responsible for the persistent immunity observed. Thus, in primary immune responses, iNOS in activated T cells autocrinely controls their susceptibility to death by neglect to determine the level of persisting CD 4 and CD 8 T cell memory, and modulation of this pathway can enhance the persistence of immune memory in response to vaccination...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis investigated the relationship between perceptions of social support and the narrative coherence of traumatic war memories. The aim {{was to understand the}} way in which social support impacts on the process of reconciliation of war memories, with implications for provision of therapy to currently and formerly serving veterans. In order to provide a lifespan perspective, war veterans from the Second World (WWII), Korean War, Falklands War, Gulf War and Britain’s ‘Small’ Wars participated in semi structured one-to-one interviews based on perceptions of social support (comradeship, family support, and societal support), media representation of war, and commemoration. Analysis of narrative content was based on the perceptions of social support, and the subsequent analysis of narrative form explored the coherence of war <b>memories</b> as an <b>indication</b> of reconciliation. Coherence was operationalised as the presence of orientation and storied structure, consistency in affect, and uniting theme(s) running through the narrative. Data from the Imperial War Museum was used to provide triangulation of the social support themes, and was analysed using thematic analysis. Archival data from the Mass Observation Archive was also consulted to corroborate the findings from the interview data, providing {{a deeper understanding of the}} role of societal support using thematic analysis. In addition, a questionnaire study was conducted to probe perceptions of media representation and perceptions towards veterans. Findings suggest that veterans can reconcile their memories earlier in life, and that communicating with family members within a supportive society may aid reconciliation. This has implications for future interventions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Working memory (WM) {{refers to}} a {{temporary}} mental „workspace‟ that allows individuals to register and manipulate information to solve complex problems. The WM system acts in concert with, and has direct influence on, other memory systems, such as long-term memory (LTM), to facilitate learning and development. Many studies indicate that WM skills are vital for acquiring basic academic skills. To date, the literature investigating the memory impairments in children with focal epilepsy has been biased toward populations with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), with little consideration to frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE). Given theories of WM (eg Baddeley, 1974) it would be reasonable to postulate greater deficits in FLE rather than TLE as frontal systems are more pertinent to WM than other brain regions. Similarly LTM {{would be expected to}} be more vulnerable in TLE, given the role of temporal lobe structures in memory, with both deficits influencing academic achievement. This study aimed to assess the memory functioning in well-characterised samples of children with TLE and FLE, by examining not only absolute levels of impairment, though also the relationships and factors which are important to efficient memory, learning, and academic achievement, using well-validated and standardised neuropsychological measures and parent ratings. Specifically, the study sample consisted of children aged six to sixteen years with well-controlled FLE (n= 18) and TLE (n= 21), recruited from Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. Children's WM, verbal and visual LTM, and academic skills were assessed Results indicate that in many domains of memory processing children with well-controlled FLE and TLE do not differ, and seizure variables were not significantly associated with memory performance. With respect to each syndrome, children with FLE do not demonstrate wide-ranging working memory impairment, though these children demonstrated frontal lobe inefficiencies indicated by higher frequency of learning errors and impaired strategy utilisation on the CVLT-C. In contrast, children with TLE demonstrate working memory impairment, indicated by impaired performance relative to normative standards on all measures of the WMTB-C, and inconsistent strength of relationships between subcomponents of working <b>memory.</b> Clinical <b>indication</b> of a central executive deficit in this group may in actuality reflect a more primary impairment of storage capacity. Academic skills were largely at expectation relative to normative standards in both groups. The central executive remained the strongest predictor of LTM, spelling, reading, math, and sentence comprehension in both groups. Parent ratings of memory performance in children were not predicted by seizure variables or objective memory performance, highlighting the need for further work to understand the predictive factors for everyday memory...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that epilepsy patients frequently report increased memory impairments compared to the normal population but that their performance on standardised memory tests does not reflect this, displaying an “objective-subjective memory discrepancy” not seen in healthy controls (e. g. Witt et al., 2012). Multiple factors have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, many summarised comprehensively by Hall et al. (2009). These explanations include methodological flaws in both objective and subjective memory assessment as well as potential influences on subjective memory report such as anxiety/depression and illness perceptions. In light of these proposals, this study aimed to assess whether the objective-subjective memory discrepancy remains to be seen in epilepsy patients when they are assessed with an ecologically valid objective memory test, the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test- Extended Version (RBMT-E) and a comprehensive subjective memory questionnaire, the Prospective Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ). Further to this the study aimed to investigate estimated IQ, verbal fluency, longer-term memory failures, anxiety/depression and illness perceptions as potential explanatory factors for the objective-subjective memory discrepancy in epilepsy patients, acting by inflating subjective memory report. Correlational and regression analysis was used to investigate predictors of subjective memory report in patients and this analysis was also performed on control participant data for comparison purposes. This study has found evidence to support an objective-subjective memory discrepancy in epilepsy, with no relationship seen between the two forms of memory assessment, despite worse memory performance in both compared to healthy controls. No evidence was found in support of hypotheses that verbal fluency difficulties may be misreported as subjective memory complaints, therefore influencing the discrepancy, or that objective memory measures are failing to detect memory difficulties in epilepsy patients due to them being too short-term in nature. Subjective memory complaints in epilepsy patients were found to be best predicted in this case by both estimated premorbid IQ and anxiety/depression symptoms, after accounting for IQ effects. This suggests a potential explanatory role for these factors in the objective-subjective memory discrepancy. Lower premorbid IQ and increased anxiety/depression symptoms in epilepsy can be proposed to influence the objective-subjective memory discrepancy seen in epilepsy patients as they inflate subjective memory reports whilst having no effect on objective <b>memory</b> performance. <b>Indications</b> of an influence of illness perceptions in predicting subjective memory complaints, after controlling for effects of IQ and anxiety/depression, were also observed. This finding however was only approaching significance and so the role of illness perceptions in the subjective-objective memory discrepancy in epilepsy therefore warrants future investigation...|$|R
