Since this is an identity of symmetric polynomials (homogeneous) of degree k, its validity for any number of variables follows from its validity for k variables. Concretely, the identities in n<k variables can be deduced by setting k−n variables to zero. The k-th Newton identity in n>k variables contains more terms {{on both sides of the}} equation than the one in k variables, but its validity will be assured if the coefficients of any <b>monomial</b> match. Because no individual <b>monomial</b> involves more than k of the variables, the <b>monomial</b> will survive the substitution of zero for some set of n−k (other) variables, after which the equality of coefficients is one that arises in the k-th Newton identity in k (suitably chosen) variables.|$|E
