500|$|Where {{the middle}} nobility {{had been the}} leading force at the sejmiks in the 16th century, the <b>magnates</b> became {{increasingly}} influential in the 18th century.

Sejmiks in Lithuania were dominated by the <b>magnates</b> {{to a greater extent than}} those in Poland proper, as the Lithuanian <b>magnates</b> were more powerful than their Polish counterparts. The magnate-dominated sejmiks, which gathered impoverished nobility, have been described as more concerned with eating and drinking than debate; for the poorest of nobility, they were a rare occasion to participate in feasts sponsored by the <b>magnates.</b> When they met, the drunken nobility was known to fight among themselves, which on occasion led to fatalities.|$|R

This effectively excluded the powerful <b>magnates</b> of the city from holding important offices, while a prison for <b>magnates</b> was built in 1294, and Giovanni Villani writes that the first <b>magnates</b> punished for failing to adhere to these ordinances were the Galli.|$|R
