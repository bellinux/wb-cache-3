40|$|Fractured {{granitic}} rock {{in an area}} of {{the northern}} Sierra Nevada, California, is investigated by detailed field geologic methods and by seismic methods. The study area is 180 m by 110 m and is located in a glaciated valley with relative flat topography. The detailed field geologic methods entailed mapping all the fractures and discontinuties over 1 m in length on a scale of 1 : 100, coring the rock and fractures for bulk mineralogy and petrographic features of joint and <b>microfault</b> structures, and development of a possible joint and <b>microfault</b> formation history. All of the joints formed by dilation displacement only. There is no evidence suggesting a conjugate shear joint system. The joint system striking N 82 - 87 E formed by dilation and appears to be older than the joint system striking N 25 - 30 W; the evidence for this is the relative amount of secondary mineralization within the fracture planes. Within the study area, some of the joints have been reactivated as left and right-lateral microfaults with average displacements between 0. 2 and 20 cm. The geophysical research of the thesis was aimed at utilizing SH-waves (shear horizontal) to investigate the solid-earth tide effect on jointed rock: tidal strain may be accommodated by opening of the joints. The research suggests the following: (1) The continued firing of the shear-wave generator altered the rigidity characteristics of the soil resulting in a change in frequency and amplitude of the emitted shear-wave; (2) Diurnal temperature change in the upper 1 m of the rock may have effected the shear-wave propagation by way of thermoelastic tilt and strain; (3) The frequency and amplitude began to stabilize after 19 hours, whereupon, a correlation in shear-wave travel-time and theoretical tidal strain is observed for the remaining 21 hours of the test...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Microstructures {{in natural}} {{fractures}} in core recovered offshore from Cape Roberts, Ross Sea, Antarctica, provide new {{constraints on the}} relative timing of faulting and sedimentation in the Victoria Land Basin along the Transantarctic Mountain rift flank. This study characterizes the textures, fabrics and grain-scale structures from thin section analysis of samples of <b>microfaults,</b> veins, and clastic dikes. <b>Microfaults</b> are abundant and display {{two different types of}} textures, interpreted to record two different deformation modes: pre-lithification shearing and brittle faulting of cohesive sediment. Both clastic dikes and calcite veins commonly follow fault planes, indicating that injections of liquefied sediment and circulating fluids used pre-existing faults as conduits. The close association of clastic injections, diagenetic mineralization, and faulting indicates that faulting was synchronous with deposition in the rift basin...|$|R

In this paper {{the origin of}} soft-sediment folding, contorted bedding, <b>microfaulting,</b> clastic dykes, shear zones and intraformational breccias is discussed. The features have a stratigraphic distribution related to major unconformities and sequence boundaries. Hypotheses for the origins of sediment deformation include hydrofracturing, subglacial shearing, slumping, and gas hydrate formation. Shear zones, <b>microfaults,</b> clastic dykes and contorted bedding within rapidly deposited sediments, suggest that slumping in an ice-distal environment occurred in the early Oligocene. A till wedge beneath a diamictite at 364 mbsf the mid-Oligocene section represents the oldest evidence of grounded ice in CRP- 2 / 2 A. Shear zones with a subglacial origin in the early late Oligocene and early Miocene sections of the core are evidence of further grounding events. The interpretation of sediment deformation in CRP- 2 / 2 A is compared to other Antarctic stratigraphic records and global eustatic change between the late Eocenel/early Oligocene and the middle Miocene...|$|R
40|$|Chromitite from seams in {{the early}} Proterozoic Great Dyke, Zimbabwe, has three types of microstructure. Grains in intact samples have an average of just over five {{slightly}} curved grain boundaries around each polygonal grain, and triangular-shaped triple grain junctions, some with grain boundaries intersecting at 120 °. These features show adjustment to a minimum surface energy configuration. Samples with extension microcracks have smaller particles on average, which are more inequant and have a stronger preferred orientation than particles in the intact samples, due to fragmentation by impingement microcracking. <b>Microfaults</b> have still smaller average particle sizes, but more equant and less well orientated angular fragments, formed by sliding and rotation of particles after linkage between extension microcracks. Intact samples have a curved relationship on a log-log plot between cumulative numbers of particles and grain size. This particle size distribution evolves with strain to a linear, fractal relationship in the <b>microfaults,</b> with a fractal dimension of 2. 8. The changes in particle size distribution are consistent with constrained comminution, and an additional process of selective fracture of larger particles.

40|$|ALH 84001 is an igneous meteorite, an orthopyroxenite of martian origin. It {{contains}} petrographic {{evidence of}} two shock metamorphic events, separated by thermal and chemical events. The evidence for two shock events suggests that ALH 84001 is ancient {{and perhaps a}} sample of the martian highlands. From petrography and mineral chemistry, the history of ALH 84001 must include: crystallization from magma, a first shock (impact) metamorphism, thermal metamorphism, low-temperature chemical alteration, and a second shock (impact) metamorphism. Originally, ALH 84001 was igneous, an orthopyroxene-chromite cumulate. In the first shock event, the igneous rock was cut by melt-breccia or cataclastic veinlets, now bands of equigranular fine-grained pyroxene and other minerals (crush zones). Intact fragments of the cumulate were fractured and strained (now converted to polygonized zones). The subsequent thermal metamorphism (possibly related to the first shock) annealed the melt-breccia or cataclastic veinlets to their present granoblastic texture and permitted chemical homogenization of all mineral species present. The temperature of metamorphism was at least 875 C, based on mineral thermometers. Next, Mg-Fe-Ca carbonates and pyrite replaced plagioclase in both clasts and granular bands, producing ellipsoidal carbonate globules with sub-micron scale compositional stratigraphy, repeated identically in all globules, The second shock event produced <b>microfault</b> offsets of carbonate stratigraphy and other mineral contacts, radial fractures around chromite and maskelynite, and strain birefringence in pyroxene. Maskelynite could not have been preserved from the first shock event, because it would have crystallized back to plagioclase. The martian source area for ALH 84001 must permit this complex, multiple impact history. Very few craters on young igneous surfaces are on or near earlier impact features. It is more likely that ALH 84001 was ejected from an old igneous unit (Hesperian or Noachian age), pocked by numerous impact craters over its long exposure at the martian surface...|$|E
40|$|Secondary {{minerals}} filling {{veins and}} vesicles in volcanic basement at Deep Sea Drilling Project Sites 458 and 459 {{indicate that there}} were two stages of alteration at each site: an early oxidative, probably hydrothermal, stage and a later, low-temperature, less oxidative stage, probably contemporaneous with faulting in the tectonically active Mariana forearc region. The initial stage is most evident in Hole 459 B, where low-Al, high Fe smectites and iron hydroxides formed in vesicles in pillow basalts and low-Al palygorskite formed in fractures. Iron hydroxides and celadonite formed in massive basalts next to quartz-oligoclase micrographic intergrowths. Palygorskite was found in only one sample near the top of basement in Hole 458, but it too is associated with iron hydroxides. Palygorskite has previously been reported only in marine sediments in DSDP and other occurrences. It evidently formed here as a precipitate from fluids in which Si, Mg, Fe, and even some Al were concentrated. Experimental data suggest that the solutions probably had high pH and somewhat elevated temperatures. The compositions of associated smectites resemble those in hydrothermal sediments and in basalts at the Galapagos mounds geothermal field. The second stage of alteration was large-scale replacement of basalt by dioctahedral, trioctahedral, or mixed-layer clays and phillipsite along zones of intense fracturing, especially near the bottom of Holes 458 and 459 B. The basalts are commonly slickensided, and there are recemented <b>microfault</b> offsets in overlying sediments. Native copper occurs in one core of Hole 458, but associated smectites are dominantly dioctahedral, unlike Hole 459 B, where they are mainly trioctahedral, indicating nonoxidative alteration. The alteration in both holes is more intense than at most DSDP ocean crust sites and may have been augmented by water derived from subducting ocean crust beneath the fore-arc region...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Coarse-grained {{limestone}} {{samples were}} collected across the Hudson Valley Fold-Thrust Belt {{with the aim of}} determining the temporal and spatial relationship between calcite twinning strain and fold-thrust belt development. The majority of the samples have well defined oblate strain ellipsoids with the maximum shortening axes (e 3) perpendicular to bedding strike, and e 3 magnitudes that range from- 1. 5 % to 6. 5 %. Whereas twinning magnitude does not vary systematically through the fold-thrust belt, twinning fabrics fall into two populations based on the presence of outcrop-scale deformational features. Calcite twinning strain preserved in samples from limestone layers absent of any small-scale penetrative deformation, such as cleavage and/or <b>microfaults,</b> are defined as component A strains. Component A strains generally have maximum shortening axes (e 3) inclined consistently less than, but in the same E-W direction as, bedding dip. The second population of calcite twinning strain, population B, occurs in limestones pervasively cut by cleavage and/or <b>microfaults.</b> Component B strains has maximum shortening axes (e 3) that are horizontal irrespective of bedding dip. Strain population A initiated as a pre-folding, layer-parallel shortening strain that was subsequently modified to its present orientation by active grain-scale rotation during flexural folding. Strain population B reflects post-folding superimposed homogeneous strain, and is restricted to limestone samples with relatively high clay content. 0 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The Elkhorn Ridge Argillite {{exposed in}} the Bourne-Sumpter area of eastern Oregon is a broken {{formation}} of metamorphosed (greenschist facies) hemipelagic sediments, reefal carbonates, rare clastics, mafic volcanics and intrusives {{that may have}} accumulated in a late Triassic-Early Jurassic subduction zone complex or marginal basin. The structural fabric of this unit is best explained by a model of repeated homoaxial folding and simple and/or pure shear during progressive deformation. Deformation began before the sediments were completely lithified and tight to isoclinal mesoscopic folds developed with and without axial-plane cleavage. A predominant spaced cleavage formed {{by a combination of}} dissolution-redeposition processes and <b>microfaulting.</b> Grain boundary sliding and movement along <b>microfaults</b> are important additional deformation mechanisms that operated during flexural slip folding. The lithology and structural style of the Elkhorn Ridge Argillite are characteristic of deformed sequences in subduction zone complexes and marginal basins and {{can not be used to}} discriminate paleotectonic settings. New faunal evidence suggests that substantial disruption of structural stratigraphic units such as the Elkhorn Ridge Argillite have taken place during the Late Triassic to late Jurassic. Coeval blocks of similar lithology and fauna are located in the Miller Mountain area within the John Day inlier of central Oregon and in several terranes distributed along the western Cordillera from California to Canada.

Tectonic data were mainly collected in Lower Carboniferous to Permian carbonates and sandstones. In both rock matrix and veins, calcite twins recorded three different tectonic stages: the first stage is a pre-Laramide (Sevier) layer-parallel shortening (LPS) parallel to fold axis, the second one is a Laramide LPS perpendicular to the fold axis, and the third stage corresponds to Laramide late fold tightening with compression also perpendicular to the fold axis. Stress and strain orientations and regimes at the microscale agree with the polyphase stress evolution revealed by populations of fractures and striated <b>microfaults,</b> testifying for the homogeneity of stress record at different scales through time. Calcite twin analysis additionally reveals significant variations of differential stress magnitudes between fold limbs. Our results especially point to an increase of differential stress magnitudes related to Laramide LPS from the backlimb to the forelimb of the fold possibly in relation with motion of an underlying basement thrust fault that likely induced stress concentrations at its upper tip. This result is confirmed by a simple numerical model. Beyond regional implications, this study highlights the potential of calcite twin analyses to yield a representative quantitative picture of stress and strain patterns related to folding...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{well-developed}} vein structures {{occur in}} Leg 112 cores from the Peru margin. Mud-filled dewatering veins occur in four styles: wide discrete gashes, veins along extensional <b>microfaults,</b> tension-gash arrays, and injections into tension gashes about slump-fold noses. Mud veins occur at shallow depths, less than 10 meters below sea floor (mbsf) in some cases, but some also were recovered {{as deep as}} 423 mbsf. Mud vein fill is slightly different in composition than the matrix and consists of {{a higher proportion of}} very fine silica, and in some cases, more authigenic carbonate or iron sulfide, transported into the veins by fluid flow. Clay minerals and many diatom fragments that are subhorizontal outside the veins have been rotated within the veins to parallel the vein walls. Formation of mud veins occurs during sediment dewatering, perhaps initiated by the collapse of diatom frustules during compaction, or by overloading during downslope slumping and sliding. Complex multigenerational vein sets exhibit sequential development from wide discrete gashes to injections along <b>microfaults</b> to dense arrays of sigmoidal tension gashes, with progressive deformation of older veins during continued downslope movement. Critical factors required to produce mud veins are high sedimentation rates, relatively high porosity and resistance to compaction, and low permeability; vein preservation is enhanced by anoxic conditions that discourage bioturbation. Carbonate-filled veins in Peru margin samples include tension gashes and wide, banded zones filled with calcite or dolomite spar; these probably result from filling of open fractures. Some sparry veins are crosscut by dewatering veins filled with calcareous mud, suggesting that the carbonate veins begin to form very early, before mud interbeds have de watered...|$|R
40|$|From the geomechanical {{point of}} view slate is {{considered}} to be one of more trying rock varieties. The results of research have shown close relationship between structural, textural and mineralogical characteristics on the one hand, and its strength and resistance to point loads on the other hand. Its weakened zones are the result of anisotropy. They develop mainly due to dynamo-metamorphosis of the primary mudstone, resulting {{in the formation of the}} secondary slaty cleavage, with a pronounced preferred orientation of the hyllosilicates. Low strength is the consequence of the weak Van der Waals chemical bond between individual packets of the internal crystal structure of the sheet minerals, particularly sericite. Bedding and microfolds with a crenulated structure and partial preferred orientation of sheet minerals, as well as directions that are weakened with sigmoidal shear deformations as the predecessors of <b>microfaults,</b> also result in significant but less problematicanisotropy.

50|$|Some {{fractures}} {{that look}} like joints are actually shear fractures, which in effect are <b>microfaults,</b> instead of joints. Shear fractures do not form {{as the result of}} the perpendicular opening of a fracture due to tensile stress, but through the shearing of fractures that causes lateral movement of its faces. Shear fractures can be confused with joints, because the lateral offset of the fracture faces is not visible at the scale of outcrop or hand specimen. Because of the absence of diagnostic ornamentation or the lack of any discernible movement or offset, they can be indistinguishable from joints. Shear fractures occur in sets of planar parallel fractures at an angle of 60 degrees and can be of the same size and scale as joints. As a result, some conjugate joint sets may actually be shear fractures. In case of such joint sets, it might be possible to distinguish joints from shear fractures by looking for the presence of slickensides, which are products of shearing movement parallel to the fracture surface. The slickensides are fine-scale, delicate ridge-in-groove lineations that are found on the surface of fracture surfaces.|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{structural}} features {{occur in}} the Leg 128 cores from the Japan Sea.

Gravity-induced structures, mainly slumps and associated faults, suggest the existence of paleoslopes and the dominance of gravitational tectonics during the early and middle Miocene, at the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary, and during the Quaternary. Several types of mud-filled veins having various shapes were observed. These are especially abundant in the middle Miocene siliceous claystones and porcellanites from the Kita-Yamato Trough. They have been interpreted as dewatering conduits that formed preferentially in highly porous, water-saturated diatomaceous muds on a slope, because of episodic loss of sediment strength, collapse of the sediment framework, and consequent fluid migration. The central part of the vein serves once as a fluid conduit, whereas the transition between conduit-controlled and intergranular flow occurs at the branching extremities, with concentration of fines. The likely trigger responsible for the strength loss is seismic activity. Development of these veins, spatially and chronologically linked to small normal <b>microfaults,</b> implies an extensional regime having layer-parallel extension and a local bedding-parallel shear couple, probably the result of gravitational gliding.

40|$|Marine {{microbial}} communities {{recorded in}} the Moroccan Anti-Atlas were unaffected across the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian transition. A stromatolite-dominated consortium was replaced {{at the beginning of}} the Atdabanian (ca 20 Myr after the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian boundary) by shelly metazoan and thromboid consortia, which contain the oldest biostratigraphically significant fossils of the Moroccan Cambrian. The associated collapse of microbial mat (stromatolitic) growth appears to coincide with a change from pre-Atdabanian shallow-water restricted conditions into Atdabanian deeper, open-sea conditions. It is postulated that this environmental change led to an episode of improved water circulation over carbonate platform interiors, promoting shelly metazoan immigration into the region. The Tiout/Amouslek lithostratigraphic contact in the early Atdabanian marks the end of an episodically unstable seafloor as suggested by the abundance of slumping and sliding structures, and synsedimentary <b>microfaults</b> and cracks {{recorded in the}} underlying Tiout Member.

In the overlying Amouslek Formation, archaeocyathan-thromboid reefs were constrained by substrate stability, water depth and subsidence rate.

Eolian beds are laminated and dominated by m- to dm-scale foresets characterized by large-scale, laterally extensive cross-beds that dip., 156 – 346 and contain reverse-graded lamination, en-echelon <b>microfaulted</b> slumps, adhesion structures, and very high ripple-index asymmetric ripples that lie on the foresets with crests that trend downdip. Lower parts of foresets are interpreted as toesets, and contain unusual Diplichnites and Protichnites trackways, which record the uphill, downhill, crest-parallel, and switchback-style movement of arthropods in dry or damp sand. Trackways that ascend dune faces do not possess a medial tail drag, whereas trackways that descend do, and turns of trackways often have deep continuous medial impressions; these features suggest arthropods leaned into the slope when turning downhill in dry sand. More shallowly dipping (, 46 – 156) cross-beds are interpreted as bottomsets. Like nearby intertidal Potsdam deposits, these beds contain Protichnites trackways and Arenicolites burrows. Paleocurrent analyses imply a coastline in which offshore and mixed-direction winds moved dunes seaward.

40|$|The {{geologic}} {{history of}} Martian meteorite Allan Hills (ALH) 84001 {{is more complex}} than previously recognized, with evidence for four or five crater-forming impacts onto Mars. This history of repeated deformation and shock metamorphism appears to weaken some arguments that have been offered for and against the hypothesis of ancient Martian life in ALH 84001. Allan Hills 84001 formed originally from basaltic magma. Its first impact event (I 1) is inferred from the deformation (D 1) that produced the granular-textured bands ("crush zones") that transect the original igneous fabric. Deformation D 1 is characterized by intense shear and may represent excavation or rebound flow of rock beneath a large impact crater. An intense thermal metamorphism followed D 1 and may be related to it. The next impact (I 2) produced fractures, (Fr 2) in which carbonate "pancakes" were deposited and produced feldspathic glass from some of the igneous feldspars and silica. After I 2, carbonate pancakes and globules were deposited in Fr 2 fractures and replaced feldspathic glass and possibly crystalline silicates. Next, feldspars, feldspathic glass, and possibly some carbonates were mobilized and melted in the third impact (I 3). <b>Microfaulting,</b> intense fracturing, and shear are also associated with 13. In the fourth impact (I 4), the rock was fractured and deformed without significant heating, which permitted remnant magnetization directions to vary across fracture surfaces. Finally, ALH 84001 was ejected from Mars in event I 5, which could be identical to I 4. This history of multiple impacts is consistent with the photogeology of the Martian highlands and may help resolve some apparent contradictions among recent results on ALH 84001. For example, the submicron rounded magnetite grains in the carbonate globules could be contemporaneous with carbonate deposition, whereas the elongate magnetite grains, epitaxial on carbonates, could be ascribed to vapor-phase deposition during I 3...|$|R

Early Oligocene arc volcanics form the basement strata (Unit 5) sampled at Sites 792 and 793. Downdropped and rotated blocks of Eocene forearc may form a sub-basement beneath these flows in the central forearc basin; mid-Eocene basement was recovered at Sites 782 and 786 on the outer-arc high during Leg 125. Basement at Site 792 was defined using the vertical seismic profile (VSP) and logging data. Deep reflectors observed on the vertical seismic profile may originate in the Eocene sub-basement. Thick sequences of coarse-grained volcaniclastic and hemipelagic sediment fill the 70 - to 140 -km-wide forearc sedimentary basin. Unrecovered (early Oligocene) strata beneath an unconformity, imaged by the multichannel seismic (MCS) line passing over Site 792, fill the deepest grabens of the central forearc and constitute Unit 4. The rapid deposition of volcaniclastics (Unit 3) during a dominant eruptive phase spanning much of the Oligocene, together with erosion of the basement highs bounding the basin, contributed to rapid subsidence and infilling. An inspection of cored materials from Unit 3 and logging data from Sites 792 and 793 reveals <b>microfaults</b> and other structural evidence for extension; on a much larger scale, MCS data show large normal faults near the frontal-arc high and outer-arc high that downfault the sediment section towards the central basin. Much of the largely pelagic or hemipelagic early Miocene section (Unit 2) has been removed by submarine valley formation and erosion, as at Sites 787 and 792.

40|$|Diatomaceous mudstones {{at depth}} under {{the deep sea}} terrace and the trench inner slope off Japan have been variably {{affected}} by tectonic stress. Veins, healed fractures, and <b>microfaults</b> occur at all sites except the shallow Site 435 on the upper trench inner slope and Site 436 on the Pacific Plate. Veins, fractures, and faults occur in cores from below 620 meters (lower to middle Miocene) in the landward sites (438 and 439) on the deep sea terrace, and are probably related to normal faulting seen in seismic records. The depth to "consolidated" sediment and to the first occurrence of veins and healed fractures shallows progressively toward the trench. The intensity of deformation also appears to increase seaward. However, no sediments younger than upper Pliocene are deformed. Open fractures may exist in situ at Sites 434 and 441 at levels between about 150 and 500 meters sub-bottom. The Japan Transect sediments—in contrast to deposits in the zone of initial deformation at other convergent margins—though highly deformed, are not highly overconsolidated. However, sediment at depth in the trench inner slope sites is overconsolidated relative to {{that at the same}} depth in the landward reference site. None of the deformed Japan margin sediments recovered at Legs 56 and 57 sites originated by accretion of oceanic plate material—also in contrast to sediments at some of the margins previously studied. We suggest that tectonic stress related to convergence has been communicated to the slope sediments on the trench inner slope, either continuously or periodically, causing rapid tectonic dewatering and inducing fracturing and faulting. If episodic, the latest of these deformational periods may have occurred during the late Pliocene. The faults and fractures are either rehealed by continued overburden pressure (sediment loading) or may remain open at shallower levels. Fracturing and dewatering of semiconsolidated sediment beneath an unconsolidated but impermeable mud veneer may cause overpressured zones at depths of 200 to 500 meters. These overpressured zones possibly locally reduce shear strength and cause downslope mass movement of sediment, even on low-angle slopes on the trench inner slope...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFromthe Proterozoic to the Quaternary, the {{evolution}} of the Earthwas characterised by recurrent periods of glaciation. However, the margins of many ancient ice-sheets are poorly defined on palaeogeographic reconstructions. The extent and outlines of ancient ice sheets can be better understood through careful documentation ofsediments deposited at the ice-sheet margin. An outstanding example is provided herein based on an end-Ordovician archive in Libya (Tihemboka area, Murzuq Basin). The four sets of structures include: i) subglacialglaciotectonic structures and soft sediment deformations from flowing glacier ice, such as intraformational glacialstriae, intraformational deformation (shear planes, sheath folds), normal <b>microfaults,</b> and large-scaleglaciotectonic folds-and-thrusts; (ii) structures resulting from overpressured subglacial (meltwater) flowssuch as clastic dykes and tunnel valleys; (iii) proglacial depositional structures and facies related to highmagnitudemeltwater floods such as sandstone intraclasts, large-scale bedforms resulting from supercriticalflows, climbing-dune cross-stratification and kettle holes; and (iv) deformation structures resulting from freefloating and nonglacier ice such as ice-keel scours and ice-crystal marks. Such a set of structures points to anice-marginal (essentially continental) depositional setting, and provides an excellent suite of criteria to identifymargins of ancient ice sheets in the stratigraphic record. At a regional scale, a reconstruction through time andspace of the related depositional wedge is proposed. This corresponded to a seismic-scale (N 120 m in thickness, 40 km in length) ice-marginal wedge in front of an essentially warm-based ice-sheet inducing concomitantlarge-scale glaciotectonic deformation, glacial basin and tunnel valley downcuttings. The related ice-front wasassociated with high-energy meltwater flows feeding a network of deeply incised proglacial channels downstreamand, beyond them, a fluvioglacial deltaic system. Shallow ice-marginal permafrost most likely affectedthe depositional wedge. At a larger scale, the Tihemboka ice-marginal wedge is interpreted as related to a stillstandperiod over the Gondwana platform, developed over an estimated interval of a few thousands of years. Based on these data, the conditions that arose in a particularly favourable context for the development, the preservationand the identification of ice-marginal wedges in the geological record are reviewed. Significantmeltwater-derived sediment deposition and aggradation in an accommodation space resulting either frompreglacial inheritance, glacial downcuttings and/or glacio-isostatic lithospheric flexure, or active tectonic subsidence(> 1 Myr) are required for their formation and subsequent preservation...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 76 - 79) The {{strength of}} the middle and lower continental crust is approximated by experimentally-derived flow laws that describe plastic flow of single mineral phase or polyphase aggregates, {{but there is little}} consensus about which aggregate compositions may best characterize this part of the crust. In this thesis, I use microstructural and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analyses to evaluate the strength of naturally-deformed quartzofeldspathic middle crust exposed in the South Mountains metamorphic core complex, Arizona. These results are compared to published quartz and feldspar experimental flow law data to evaluate the applicability of these flow laws for assessing the strength of middle continental crust. Microstructural analysis of the constituent minerals in the South Mountains granodiorite shows that strain is accommodated by crystal plastic deformation and dynamic recrystallization in quartz, limited crystal plasticity in orthoclase feldspar, and brittle <b>microfaulting</b> in plagioclase feldspar. The microstructures suggest that quartz is the weakest phase in the rock, and the crystal plastic deformation of the abundant quartz dominates the strain localization process during mid-crustal shearing. EBSD analyses reveal that dynamically recrystallized quartz grains exhibit lattice preferred orientation (LPO) indicative of basal and rhomb slip, and that orthoclase and plagioclase feldspar exhibit limited evidence for LPO and an absence of LPO, respectively. Together, the microstructural and EBSD data suggest that the operative deformation mechanism in the interconnected network of abundant quartz is dislocation creep, whereas the dominant deformation mechanism in the feldspars is brittle fracturing. I use the ???wet??? quartz flow laws of Hirth et al. (2001) and Rutter and Brodie (2004) to create deformation mechanism maps in which I compare the predicted strength of quartz aggregates to the observed {{strength of the}} granodiorite mylonites of the South Mountains metamorphic core complex. Given the deformation conditions of the South Mountains mylonites, the strength of these rocks are best fit by the quartzite flow law of Hirth et al. (2001) at temperatures 500 ??C, and the quartzite flow law of Rutter and Brodie (2004) at temperatures of 600 ??C. The results suggest that the strength of quartz may be a proxy for the bulk strength of the rock during ductile deformation, and that quartz flow laws may provide the best estimate of the strength of deforming continental crust where quartz is abundant, interconnected, and deforming by dislocation creep...|$|R
40|$|Late Ordovician Red River {{strata of}} southeastern Saskatchewan were {{deposited}} {{in a broad}} epicontinental sea. In the lower part, the Yeoman and Herald formations comprise two cycles of carbonate–evaporite sequences. Although these units possess an overall ‘layer-cake’ aspect, thickness variations especially in the Herald Formation show that accumulation was affected by syndepositional flexure, differential subsidence and displacement of fault-bounded blocks. The mainly laminated dolomudstones and anhydrites of the Lake Alma and Coronach members of the Herald Formation were deposited under relatively tranquil conditions. These units host different kinds of synsedimentary deformation features, interpreted to have been induced by earthquakes generated because of movements along basement faults {{thought to have been}} oriented orthogonally NE&# 8722;SW and NW&# 8722;SE. The low-energy environmental setting was conducive to preserving these features, referred to as ‘seismites’. The variety of seismites in the Herald Formation is related to the varying rheology of the carbonate or evaporite sediment, as well as shaking intensity. Brittle and quasi-brittle failure is represented by faults, <b>microfaults,</b> shear-vein arrays and pseudo-intraclastic breccias, mostly in dolomudstones which must have been stiff at the time of deformation. Plastic behaviour is recorded by soft-sediment deformation, comprising a family of features that includes loop bedding, folded laminae and convolute bedding. Indeed, these structures in enterolithic anhydrite are more reasonably interpreted as due to deformation than crystal growth, volume expansion and displacement, the more usual explanations. Sediment shrinkage and concomitant fluidization are recorded by dikelets containing injected carbonate mud or granular gypsum, the latter now preserved as anhydrite. Evidence for wholesale liquefaction, however, was not observed. These rheological differences were caused by the primary nature of the sediment plus modifications due to early diagenesis and burial confinement. Shaking intensity is difficult to gauge, but it is presumed that a minimum of VI on the modified Mercalli scale was required to produce these features. Consequently, shaking of lesser magnitude was probably not recorded. The geographic distribution of seismites should reflect the location of basement faults presumed to have been active during deposition, and indeed there is a concentration adjacent to the known location of syndepositonal fault lineaments. In addition, the stratigraphic distribution of seismites records higher frequencies of activity of these same faults. These distributions show that earthquake-induced ground motion was common during deposition of the Lake Alma Member in southeastern Saskatchewan but less so during deposition of the Coronach Member. Seismites serve as proxies for the activity of relatively nearby syndepositional faults making up the tectonic fabric of sedimentary basins. They also point to basement features that, if re-activated, can induce fracture porosity or influence subsurface fluid flow. Syndepositional tectonism undoubtedly had a much more profound influence on many successions than is presently accepted, and its effects are more widespread than currently appreciated...|$|R
40|$|Monte Grighini Complex is a NW-SE {{elongated}} dome-shaped metamorphic complex which outcrops {{in central}} Sardinia {{in the eastern}} side of Campidano graben. This Complex consists of a pile of variscan Nappe. From top to bottom they are: Gerrei Unit, Castello Medusa Unit, M. Grighini Unit. Gerrei Unit (Upper Unit) crops out along the Flumendosa antiform and consists of Porfiroidi auct. (Middle Ordovician), metasandstone, metavolcanics, Upper Ordovician-Silurian sedimentary succession and Devonian limestones (Carmignani et al., 2001). In the Monte Grighini area, the Gerrei Unit is made up of porphiroids, phyllites and mylonitic granitoids outcropping in the south-west of the complex (Musumeci 1991). This Unit has been affected by polyphasic Variscan tectonic events (D 1,D 2) followed by a late D 3 shear deformation. D 1 gives rise to NW-SE isoclinals folds with sub-horizontal axial plane schistosity (S 1). D 2 event causes prevailing simple shear deformation which results in structure and microstructure related to NE-SW compressional event (Carosi et al., 1990). The Castello Medusa Unit crops out in tectonic windows along the Flumendosa antiform. It consists of a sedimentary succession made up of metasandstones to shales and limestones of Cambrian-Carboniferous age. The Monte Grighini Unit (Lower Unit), located in the north-east side of the complex, shows the higher metamorphic grade represented by mostly mylonitic micaschist and gneiss of amphibolite facies. In this Unit, a D 2 deformational event gave rise to a pervasive S 2 schistosity deforming previous D 1 structures and transposing the S 1 schistosity. Monte Grighini Unit is also intruded by a suite of granitoids, mostly monzogranite and leucogranite (Musumeci 1992). Rb/Sr and Ar/Ar radiometric data give an age of about 305 - 300 Ma (Carmignani et al., 1987; Laurenzi et al., 1991). Along the southern side, the granitoids are overlained by Upper Unit with the contact marked by a cataclastic fault zone. The leucogranite can be found mostly close to the cataclastic fault zone. Granitoids follow the regional trend (NW-SE) and show a pervasive subvertical schistosity and mineralogical lineation related to the late D 3 deformation event. Several outcrops show a rapid change in the intensity of mylonitic deformation. One of these has been investigated in some detail. The studied outcrop in 1. 5 metres shows a transition from slightly to strongly deformed leucogranite. On the basis of granulometric, chromatic and schistosity morphology, five layers have been identified from each of which were taken some samples. The layer subdivision follow the pervasive foliation that affects the entire outcrop with N 162 °-N 170 ° direction and 60 °- 65 ° W dipping. The firs layer (L 1) consists of about 40 cm of massive, coarse-grained, leucocratic rock with just a mild foliation and a moderate alteration grade. At the outcrop scale, it is possible to recognize plagioclase and K-feldspar phenocrysts and dark biotite layers parallel to the main foliation. Moving toward NW there is a sharp transition to a thin (4 cm) strongly foliated, very fine-grained rock layer (L 2). This layer consists of very thin dark- and light-colored alternating levels. Layer L 3, 10 cm in thickness, is similar to the previous one but shows a more spaced foliation and a coarser grain size. The color becomes darker than L 2, due to millimetric trails and lenses of mafic minerals (biotite). In this layer the foliation envelopes the millimetric crystals aggregates. Layer L 4 (70 cm thick) is light-colored as compared to layer L 3 and the alternating levels appear to be thicker. In this Layer grain size increases again, several minerals can be observed at the naked eye and foliation appears less pervasive than the previous layer L 3. In Layer 5, (30 cm thick) millimetric-thick very fine grained levels alternate with prevailing medium grained ones. Coarse-grained portion appear as a microcrystalline matrix with lens and levels of mafic minerals. Several thin sections has been realized for each level for microstructural, mineralogical, and petrographic analyses. Mylonitic granitoid consists of the following paragenesis: quartz, k-felspar, plagioclase, muscovite, biotite, iron oxides and ± tourmaline, ± apatite, ± zircon, ± epidote. Almost all samples are characterized by k-feldspar phenocrysts within a quartz + phyllosilicate-rich matrix. k-felspar porphyroclasts sometimes show antithetic <b>microfaults.</b> Generally quartz has typical fabric of dynamic recrystallisation: relics of large old quartz grain pass laterally into domains of recrystallised small grains (50 - 100 μm). L 1 is characterized by k-feldspar, quartz and plagioclase phenocrysts, floating in a matrix of microcrystalline quartz and phillosilicate-rich levels (protomylonite). k-feldspar phenocrysts are generally fractured and sometimes show albite exsolutions (perthite). Quartz occurs mostly as microcrystalline lenses and bands which follow the weak foliation. Plagioclase range in composition between albite and oligoclase. Phyllosilicates (largely biotite and muscovite) occur in thin trails and sometimes submillmetric crystals arranged along the foliation. Towards the ultramylonitic zone, muscovite content decreases up to its almost complete disappearance. Based on its average porphyroclast/matrix ratio of about 60 / 40, the rock can be classified as protomylonite (Higgins, 1971). Layer 2 is characterized by a strong shift to ultramylonitic conditions with a porphyroclast/matrix ratio of 2 / 98. In this layer {{it is not possible to}} distinguish any mineral except some strongly fractured k-feldspar relics. In Layer 3 porphyroclast/matrix ratio decreases up to 30 / 70 whereas the grain size increase. This sample can be classified as mylonite. In this layer clusters of euhedral tourmaline (?) crystals not following the pervasive rock foliation have been found. Muscovite has been rarely found. In layer L 4 the texture is again protomylonitic, characterized by increasing grain size and phenocrists abundance (60 / 40 porphyroclast/matrix ratio); micas are well visible in these samples with a local intergrowth of biotite and muscovite. Layer L 5 again shows that porphyroclast/matrix ratio varying from 40 / 60 to 25 / 75 therefore it can be classified as mylonite. Fractures are filled by euhedral and microcrystalline quartz. In this levels locally occurs millimetric ultramylonitic trails. Field observations and petrographic analyses suggest that protomylonite, mylonite and ultramylonite repeteadly alternate at the centrimetric to decimetric scale. ...|$|R

İnceleme alanı ve çevresinde yaklaşık 450 km 2 ’lik bir alanda yüzeyleyen Çataldağ plütonik topluluğu birbiri ile mekansal ortaklık gösteren ancak farklı yaşlardaki 2 ayrı granitik gövdeden ana plütondan oluşmaktadır; Çataldağ granodiyoriti ve Çataldağ graniti. Çataldağ granodiyoriti erken Miyosen yaşlıdır (20 - 21 My) ve plütonik topluluğun batı kesimlerini oluşturur. Bu tez çalışmasının ana konusu olan Çataldağ graniti ise Erken Oligosen (33 My) yaşlıdır ve plütonik topluluğun doğu kesimlerini oluşturur. Bu tez çalışması kapsamında Çataldağ granitinin kuzey dokanağı boyunca ayrıntılı saha ve laboratuvar çalışmaları yapılmış, Çataldağ granitinin çevre kayaçlarla ilişkileri saptanmış, petrografik, jeokimyasal (ana-iz element ve Sr-Nd izotop), mikro ve mezo yapısal özellikleri ortaya konulmuştur. Elde edilen veriler ışığında Çataldağ granitinin kökeni, evrimi ve bölge tektonizması ile ilişkisinin ne olduğu sorununa yaklaşımda bulunulmaya çalışılmıştır. Çataldağ graniti biyotit granit ve biyotit-muskovit (2 mikalı) granit ve migmatitik granitler, mafik ve felsik sin-plütonik dayklardan oluşur, jeokimyasal olarak yüksek potasyumlu kalkalkalen, peraluminyumlu niteliklidir. Sr-Nd izotop bileşimleri ve ana-iz element paternleri Çataldağ granitinin yüksek kabuk bileşeni içeren yada kabuksal ergime sonucu gelişen bir granit olduğunu göstermektedir. Çataldağ granitinin Sin-plütonik gabro-diyorit bileşimli mafik dayklar tarafından kesilmektedir. Bunların jeokimyasal özellikleri zenginleşmiş manto ergiyiklerinden türediklerine işaret eder. Bu veriler Çataldağ granitinin çarpışma sonrası (Post Collisional) magmatizmanın ürünü olduğunu desteklemektedir. Çataldağ graniti Alt Oligosen döneminde mezozonda diyapirik olarak yerleşimine başlamış, daha geç evrede erken Miyosende ise yeşilşist fasiyesinde metamorfik (Nilüfer birimi) ve metamorfik olmayan (Orhanlar grovağı ve Bornava Flişi) temel kayaları içine Çataldağ sıyrılma fayı yardımı ile yerleşmiştir. Çataldağ graniti hemen her alanda dinamik metamorfizmadan etkilenmiş, magmatik doku ve yapıları bir çok alanda korunamamıştır. Yapılan mikro yapısal incelemeler sonucunda elde edilen veriler Çataldağ granitinin maruz kaldığı deformasyonun iki farklı sıcaklık aralığında geliştiğini gösterir: (1) 600 °C- 250 °C arasında ve (2) 250 °C’den düşük sıcaklıklarda meydana gelen deformasyonlar. Gerek mikro yapısal incelemeler gerekse sahada gözlenen mezo ölçekli yapılar Çataldağ granitinde gözlenen her iki deformasyonun da aynı gerilme yönüne sahip olduğunu göstermiştir. Derinde gelişmiş sünek ve bunu üzerleyen sığda gelişmiş kırılgan deformasyon birlikte kuzey yönlü bir gerilmeye işaret etmektedir.

Buna göre Çataldağ graniti Kazdağ masifininin bir çekirdek kompleksi olarak yükselme evresi (24 My) ile Uludağ masifinin hızla yükselmesi (20 - 21 My) ile üzerlenen bir dönemde KB Anadolu’nun gerilme evrimi içerisinde yükselmiş ve yüzeylenmiştir. This study {{presents}} geology, tectonics and major-trace element geochemistry (combined with Sr-Nd-Pb isotope compositions) of Cataldag granite exposed {{around the}} Mustafakemalpasa and Susurluk town of Balıkesir and Bursa. In {{the study area}} four main rock groups are distinguished. These are from bottom to the top as follows; a) Basement rocks b) Cataldag granite and c) Sedimentary association d) Alluvium The basement rocks (Nilüfer unit) {{are made up of}} metapelites and metabasites that are Triassic in age. They represent the “Karakaya complex” belonging to Sakarya continent. Sedimentary association rest unconformably on the metamorphic basement rocks. Cataldag granite is represented by biotite granite and biotite muscovite granites. granitic in composition. Petrographically, they display holocrystalline, hipidiomorphic granuler texture. Cataldag granite is affected by dynamic metamorphism in general. Cataldag granite have foliations in different orientations. Dip values of these foliations differ from 5 to 35 °. In {{the northern part of the}} pluton, dip directions of foliations rotate towards the north and their strikes become parallel to Cataldag detachment fault. Microstructural studies on Cataldag granite indicate that deformations in Cataldag granite develop in two different temperature ranges: (1) deformations developed at 600 - 250 °C and (2) deformations developed at < 250 °C. Grain boundary migrations in quartz and myrmekite formations are some examples for deformations which develop between 600 - 250 °C. Deformations that develop under 250 °C are represented by subgrain rotations and <b>microfaults</b> which characterize brittle deformation. New major-trace element geochemical data and Sr-Nd isotope compositions obtained from this study and geology of the study area together with regional correlations are in good agreement with the magmas of post collisional tectonic setting which are originated from crustal melting. In northwestern Turkey, during the late Cretaceous-early Tertiary period, Northward subduction and consumption of Neotethyan Ocean resulted in continent-continent collision between Sakarya continent and Anatolid-Tauride platform (Şengör and Yılmaz, 1981). Timing of the continent-continent collision is not well documented in the literature. However, units of both the suture zone and the Sakarya continent were covered unconformably by middle Eocene aged sedimentary rocks (Gebeler formation; Akyürek and Soysal, 1983; Başlamış formation, the Akdeniz, 1980). This data indicate that continent-continent collision developed before the middle Eocene. Cataldag pluton crops out at the northern part of Izmir Ankara Suture Zone (IASZ) and both emplaced in basement rocks of Sakarya continent and sture zone units (Akyuz, 1996). Radiometric ages indicates that Cataldag pluton has 26 - 20 Ma (Late Oligocene- Early Miocene) cooling ages (Boztug et. al. 2009, Kamacı and Altunkaynak 2011, Altunkaynak et. al. 2012). In the Northwestern Anatolia, a number of exposed plutons which have similar ages are completely have hybrid composition and calc-alkaline in character and represented by I-type granitoids. Geochemically, they show similarity to volcanic arc and post-collisional magmatic associations (Bingöl et al, 1982, 1992; Güleç, 1991; Yılmaz, 1989, 1990; Aldanmaz et al., 2000;Yılmaz, 2001; Altunkaynak and Dilek 2006, Altunkaynak, 2012). Many researchers interpreted the early Miocene magmatism as arc magmatism by taking into consideration of their geochemical features, similar to subduction-related (Fytikas, 1984; Pe Piper and Piper, 1989; Gülen 1990; Ercan, 1979; Delaloye and Bingöl, 2000). However, according to geological features of West Anatolia, there is no geological evidence supporting an active arc magmatism NW Anatolia during the the early Miocene. Taking this into consideration, the geochemical features of samples were considered as the records of previous subduction events. (Aldanmaz et al., 2000; Yılmaz et al., 2001). Overall evaluation of geology of NW Anatolia and the geological and geochemical features of Cataldag granite indicates that, in NW Anatolia, Cataldag granite represets a unique example of S type granites which were derived from continental crust during the Oligocene?. Cataldag granite, geochemically, is granitic in composition that is consistent with petrographical investigations. The studied rock samples are subalkaline and generally calc-alkaline in character. They have high K content and various SiO 2 contents ranging from 71 to 78 %. They display enrichment in LILE elements, K, Rb, Ba, Th, Sr with the strong depletion in Ti and Nb that are typical of subduction-related magmatic associations or post collisional magmatic associations. Both samples belong to Cataldag granite have similar major-trace element characteristics and Sr-Nd isotope compositions indicating that they are co-genetic and were originated from a common magma. The Sr-Nd isotopic signatures and trace element characteristics of Cataldag granite are similar to the anatectic granitoids which derived from melting of continental crust. This shows that Cataldag granite is similar to the anatectic granites which are originated from crustal melting. Structural properties of the study area indicates that, an extensional regime is dominant in the area from the begining of Late Oligocene- Early Miocene. A detachement fault which is located at the northern part of the area brings Cataldag granite and basement rocks side by side. Cataldag granite was affected by a ductile and overlaying brittle deformation. This deformation is contionous and starts to develop at 600 °C to 250 °C and lower temperatures. The reason of this deformations is Cataldag detachment fault (CDF). Cataldag granite undergone to ductile deformation at depths with the movement of CDF, and at shallower depts ductile deformation is overlayed by brittle deformation. This detachment fault indicates an extensional regime which is dominant int he are at Early Miocene. This conclusion is compatible with other studies in the area. Many studies indicate that this extensional regime is the main reason for the development of this detachment faults. But the time of the begining of this extensional regime is not clearly mentioned before. According to the Ar/Ar age date obtained from biotite and muscovite od Cataldag granite Kamaci and Altunkaynak 2010 suggest that the age of the deformation is 20 - 22 Ma (Early Miocene) This data indicates that, CDF which is the main reason for the deformation of Cataldag granite, was active at Early Miocene.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the sedimentological/stratigraphic and {{structural}} evolution of the sedimentary rocks {{that occur in the}} NW continental border of the Potiguar Basin. These rocks are well exposed along coastal cliffs between the localities of Lagoa do Mato and Icapuí, Ceará State (NE Brazil). The sedimentological/stratigraphic study involved, at the outcrop scale, detailed facies descriptions, profile mapping of the vertical succession of different beds, and columnar sections displaying inferred lateral relationships. The approach was complemented by granulometric and petrographic analyses, including the characterization of heavy mineral assemblages. The data set allowed to recognize two kinds of lithological units, a carbonate one of very restricted occurrence {{at the base of the}} cliffs, and three younger, distinct siliciclastic units, that predominate along the cliffs, in vertical and lateral extent. The carbonate rocks were correlated to the late Cretaceous Jandaíra Formation, which is covered by the siliciclastic Barreiras Formation. The Barreiras Formation occurs in two distinct structural settings, the usual one with nondeformed, subhorizontal strata, or as tilted beds, affected by strong deformation. Two lithofacies were recognized, vertically arranged or in fault contacts. The lower facies is characterized by silty-argillaceous sandstones with low-angle cross bedding; the upper facies comprises medium to coarse grained sandstones, with conglomeratic layers. The Tibau Formation (medium to coarse-grained sandstones with argillite intercalations) occurs at the NW side of the studied area, laterally interlayered with the Barreiras Formation. Eolic sediments correlated to the Potengi Formation overly the former units, either displaying an angular unconformity, or simply an erosional contact (stratigraphic unconformity). Outstanding structural features, identified in the Barreiras Formation, led to characterize a neocenozoic stress field, which generated faults and folds and/or reactivated older structures in the subjacent late cretaceous (to paleogene, in the offshore basin) section. The structures recognized in the Barreiras Formation comprise two distinct assemblages, namely a main extensional deformation between the localities of Ponta Grossa and Redonda, and a contractional style (succeeded by oblique extensional structures) at Vila Nova. In the first case, the structural assemblage is dominated by N-S (N± 20 °Az) steep to gently-dipping extensional faults, displaying a domino-style or listric geometry with associated roll-over structures. This deformation pattern is explained by an E-W/WNW extension, contemporaneous with deposition of the upper facies of the Barreiras Formation, during the time interval Miocene to Pleistocene. Strong rotation of blocks and faults generated low-angle distensional faults and, locally, subvertical bedding, allowing to estimate very high strain states, with extension estimates varying between 40 % up to 200 %. Numerous detachment zones, parallel to bedding, help to acommodate this intense deformation. The detachment surfaces and a large number of faults display mesoscopic features analoguous to the ones of ductile shear zones, with development of S-C fabrics, shear bands, sigmoidal clasts and others, pointing to a hydroplastic deformation regime in these cases. Local occurrences of the Jandaíra limestone are controled by extensional faults that exhume the pre-Barreiras section, including an earlier event with N-S extension. Finally, WNWtrending extensional shear zones and faults are compatible with the Holocene stress field along the present continental margin. In the Vila Nova region, close to Icapuí, gentle normal folds with fold hinges shallowly pluging to SSW affect the lower facies of the Barreiras Formation, displaying an incipient dissolution cleavage associated with an extension lineation at high rake (a S>L fabric). Deposition of the upper facies siliciclastics is controlled by pull-apart graben structures, bordered by N-NE-trending sinistral-normal shear zones and faults, characterizing an structural inversion. Microstructures are compatible with tectonic deformation of the sedimentary pile, burried at shallow depths. The observed features point to high pore fluid pressures during deformation of the sediments, producing hydroplastic structures through mechanisms of granular flow. Such structures are overprinted by microfractures and <b>microfaults</b> (an essentially brittle regime), tracking the change to microfracturing and frictional shear mechanisms accompanying progressive dewatering and sediment lithification. Correlation of the structures observed at the surface with those present at depth was tested through geophysical data (Ground Penetrating Radar, seismics and a magnetic map). EW and NE-trending lineaments are observed in the magnetic map. The seismic sections display several examples of positive flower structures which affect the base of the cretaceous sediments; at higher stratigraphic levels, normal components/slips are compatible with the negative structural inversion characterized at the surface. Such correlations assisted in proposing a structural model compatible with the regional tectonic framework. The strong neogenepleistocene deformation is necessarily propagated in the subsurface, affecting the late cretaceous section (Açu and Jandaíra formations), wich host the hydrocarbon reservoirs in this portion of the Potiguar Basin. The proposed structural model is related to the dextral transcurrent/transform deformation along the Equatorial Margin, associated with transpressive terminations of E-W fault zones, or at their intersections with NE-trending lineaments, such as the Ponta Grossa-Fazenda Belém one (the LPGFB, itself controlled by a Brasiliano-age strike-slip shear zone). In a first step (and possibly during the late Cretaceous to Paleogene), this lineament was activated under a sinistral transpressional regime (antithetic to the main dextral deformation in the E-W zones), giving way to the folds in the lower facies of the Barreiras Formation, as well as the positive flower structures mapped through the seismic sections, at depth. This stage was succeeded (or was penecontemporaneous) by the extensional structures related to a (also sinistral) transtensional movement stage, associated to volcanism (Macau, Messejana) and thermal doming processes during the Neogene-Pleistocene time interval. This structural model has direct implications to hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation activities at this sector of the Potiguar Basin and its offshore continuation. The structure of the reservoirs at depth (Açu Formation sandstones of the post-rift section) may be controlled (or at least, strongly influenced) by the deformation geometry and kinematics characterized at the surface. In addition, the deformation event recognized in the Barreiras Formation has an age close to the one postulated for the oil maturation and migration in the basin, between the Oligocene to the Miocene. In this way, the described structural cenario represents a valid model to understand the conditions of hydrocarbon transport and acummulation through space openings, trap formation and destruction. This model is potentially applicable to the NW region of the Potiguar Basin and other sectors with a similar structural setting, along the brazilian Equatorial Atlantic MarginEsta tese contempla a caracterização sedimentológica/litoestratigráfica e estrutural das rochas sedimentares na porção continental NW da Bacia Potiguar, e que afloram em falésias no setor litorâneo compreendido entre as localidades de Lagoa do Mato e Icapuí, Ceará (NE do Brasil). Os estudos sedimentológicos /estratigráficos das unidades mapeadas, em escala de afloramento, envolveram descrições faciológicas, levantamento de perfis com empilhamento vertical das diferentes camadas, e a construção de seções colunares caracterizando as relações laterais observadas. Ainda foram realizados estudos granulométricos e petrográficos, bem como a identificação das assembléias de minerais pesados. O conjunto desses dados permitiu identificar dois grupos de litologias, representados por uma unidade carbonática, que ocorre de forma restrita na base das falésias, e três unidades siliciclásticas, que predominam lateral e verticalmente, nas falésias. As rochas carbonáticas, correlacionadas à Formação Jandaíra, do Cretáceo superior, são capeadas pelas rochas siliciclásticas da Formação Barreiras. A Formação Barreiras ocorre em dois contextos estruturais distintos, sob a forma de estratos horizontalizados e não deformados, a situação mais usual, ou com camadas basculadas e afetadas por forte deformação. Foram individualizadas duas litofácies, dispostas verticalmente em contatos normais, ou por falhas. A denominada fácies inferior é composta por arenitos síltico-argilosos com estratificação cruzada de baixo ângulo; a fácies superior é caracterizada por arenitos médios a grossos, maciços, com intercalações conglomeráticas. No extremo NW da área ocorre uma segunda unidade, a Formação Tibau (arenitos médios a grossos com intercalações de argilitos), que está lateralmente interdigitada com a Formação Barreiras. Finalmente, no topo das unidades anteriores ocorrem sedimentos eólicos correlacionados à Formação Potengi. A discordância na base desta última unidade (a Formação Potengi) torna-se nítida quando os estratos sotopostos estão basculados e falhados (discordância angular). Para os demais casos, o contato é erosional (discordância estratigráfica). Na área estudada, chamam atenção as feições estruturais identificadas na Formação Barreiras, que permitem caracterizar o campo de tensões neocenozóico, que gerou falhas e dobras e/ou reativou estruturas mais antigas na seção neocretácica (a paleógena, no setor offshore da bacia) subjacente. As feições estruturais identificadas nas rochas da Formação Barreiras permitem distinguir duas situações|$|R
