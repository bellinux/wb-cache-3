40|$|Extract: In the mid- 1980 s {{a number}} of French associations, {{supported}} by {{a small group of}} magistrates, decided to try <b>mediation</b> <b>in</b> <b>penal</b> <b>matters,</b> drawing their inspiration from initiatives originating in North America. In response to a judicial process that the associations considered abstract, oriented towards the past, degrading for offenders and indifferent to the needs of victims, the associations put forward a more flexible solution, one more respectful of individuals, more concerned to repair the damage done by crime, one which, instead of cutting across and exacerbating disputes, tries to unravel and assuage them...|$|E

40|$|Following the European Union Guidelines (CEPEJ: 2007, 13) {{concerning}} <b>mediation</b> <b>in</b> <b>penal</b> <b>matters,</b> the Italian {{criminal justice}} authorities are developing programs for cooperation with mediation services {{in order to}} reach victims and offenders more effectively. Restorative Justice (RJ) is a process whereby parties with a stake in a specific offence collectively resolve {{how to deal with the}} aftermath of the offence and its implications for the future. According to Bazemore and Walgrave (1999), RJ can be defined as “every action that is primarily oriented towards doing justice by repairing the harm that has been caused by a crime”. RJ is not originally a EU concept, and its application in Italy is still tentative and limited. RJ began as an experiment to seek alternatives to criminal prosecution and conventional sentencing, especially where aboriginal populations were involved. The Correctional Service of Canada started to introduce RJ programs in many of its prisons in 1974 and RJ is now widely applied in North America and is attracting growing attention from governments. In the UK, the practice was introduced in the 1980 s and then implemented in the 1990 s. In 1989 the New Zealand government enacted the Children, Young Persons and their Families Act; Australia followed with the implementation of family group conferencing in several jurisdictions. What does RJ consist of? It essentially involves “restoring relationships, with establishing or re-establishing social equality in relationships” (Llewellyn & Howse 1998 : 1); it involves the victim, the offender, and the community in a search for solutions that promote repair, reconciliation, and reassurance. Considerable emphasis is laid on victims’ needs, which are fully considered in victim/offender mediation practices, whereas the focus in ordinary criminal justice is on offenders. To use Zehr’s words (1990), it entails a ‘Changing Lenses’ philosophy, aimed at facilitating dialogue between all those affected by the wrongdoing or conflict, while encouraging those responsible for the harm to become accountable for their actions. All those affected should be given the opportunity to share their stories, their feelings and their needs in order to find mutually acceptable ways forward by repairing/building relationships. RJ actually endeavors to attend to victims’ needs – material, financial, emotional and social–including those personally close to the victims. Another key objective is to prevent re-offending by reintegrating offenders into the community, thereby avoiding the escalation of legal justice and the associated costs. In our study we analyzed qualitative samples of mediation practices, such as linguistic exchanges, from a cross-cultural perspective by comparing textual data and evaluating it in their contextual implications in the light of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} criminal justice {{policy in the}} Netherlands from 1994 until 2002. These so-called purple years, {{in reference to the}} labour–liberal coalition government in office were characterized by falling crime rates and a hugely expanding criminal justice state at the expense of traditional Dutch reductionist penal policy. The emergence of a Dutch-style crime complex requires scrutiny in light of Downes’s emphasis on Dutch post-war tolerance towards lawbreakers. I conclude that tolerance no longer is a driving force <b>in</b> <b>penal</b> <b>matters</b> but it continues to inform the governance of areas of ambiguous morality such as euthanasia and prostitution. The beneficiaries of the new tolerance are no longer offenders but rather those making certain life choices or preferring certain lifestyles. This article looks at causes and effects of these changes in the nature of criminal justice governance in the Netherlands. Key Words crime complex • Netherlands • penalization • tolerance A Dutch-style crime complex The concept of Dutch tolerance to deviance emerged largely thanks to Downes’s work on <b>penal</b> policy <b>in</b> the Netherlands (Downes, 1982, 1988). It generated lively debate, not least in the Netherlands itself (e. g. de Haan, 1990; Franke, 1990).

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} old practice of customary <b>mediation</b> <b>in</b> the Northern Albanian society. The data {{used in this}} research was mainly generated through interviews with community mediators. The strategies and techniques used by the mediators in twenty-seven cases of killings (due to blood feud, momentary and previous fight or accidents) were analyzed. The strategies were analyzed {{on the basis of}} Bercovitch and Huston classification: communication-facilitation, rocedural-formulation and directive-manipulation strategies. The techniques were analyzed based on Callister and Wall's table of mediator's techniques <b>in</b> community <b>mediation.</b> Further more the reconciliatory process was also analyzed through Lederach's framework of the elements of reconciliation: truth, mercy, justice and peace. Examining the twenty-seven cases of <b>mediation</b> <b>in</b> the Albanian context we can conclude that most of the killings happened due to momentary fights and mostly they were people who had relations with each other. In analyzing the strategies of the mediators it is searched whether they use more communication-facilitation, procedural-formulation or manipulation. The findings showed that in most case the mediators used either communication-facilitation or directive-manipulation. The techniques used in these cases reflect the features of Albanian mediation but they also give us insight on other techniques the mediators use <b>in</b> community <b>mediation</b> <b>in</b> <b>penal</b> case. These techniques are bounded by the cultural background and the rules of the Customary Law. Albanian traditional mediation bares the characteristics of VOM and the traditional mediators abide by the Restorative Justice principles. Albanian mediation shows to bare the characteristics of the cultural context in which it takes place. The values found in the Albanian customary law, Kanun, in a way guide the mediation process as well.

40|$|Abstract The {{extradition}} has as {{source of}} regulation the bilateral and multilateral conventions, reciprocity declarations and internal law, {{the main source}} of regulation being found primarily in conventions or reciprocity declarations. The international conventions or the treaties represent international agreements concluded between states and governed by the international law; either they are cosigned in a single instrument, either in two or more annexes, irrespective of their particular denomination. These are bi or multilateral acts resulted from the agreement of the states and are governed by the principle „Pacta sunt servanda”, representing the law of the parties which must be executed in good faith. Concretely in Romania, the extradition was regulated as a law institution, in art. 16 - 19 of the Criminal Code and in the art. 630 - 638 of the Procedure Criminal Code, Carol II of 1936, the texts mentioned above just consecrating the principles already known of the international <b>penal</b> law. Nowadays, <b>in</b> our country the extradition is regulated by Law no. 302 / 2004 relating to international judicial cooperation <b>in</b> <b>penal</b> <b>matters</b> amended by Law no. 224 / 2006, GEO 103 / 2006 and Law no. 222, this special law clearly stipulating their substantive and formal issues, fixing also the legal framework in the limits of which can be solicited or admitted, its sources of regulation, as well as the order in which they can be used...|$|R

40|$|The European {{arrest warrant}} {{is the most}} {{important}} form of judicial cooperation <b>in</b> <b>penal</b> <b>matters</b> within the European Union, which is based on the mutual recognition of criminal judgments. The Europeanlegislative act that governs the institution is the Framework Decision no. 2002 / 584 /JHA of 13 July 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States, amended and supplemented by the Council Framework Decision of 2009 / 299 /JAI February 26, 2009. Although the first piece of the European legislative act has been transposed into our legislation by the Law no. 302 / 2004 on international judicial cooperation in criminal matters, with subsequent amendments, the modifying normativeact has not been transposed into national law. The research conducted on the depositions of special law and of the European legislative act, and especially on their implications in the internal and European judiciary practice, demonstrates the existence of some incomplete stipulations, secures the workability of the issuing,transmission and identification, pursuing and handing over the persons wanted by the Romanian judicial authorities in the Member States. A very special situation which is determined by the omission of national and EU legislator, in order to include the category of the persons submitted to the handing over and the minors against whom it was applied an educational and a deprivation of liberty measure, a situation which leads directly to the non execution of such sanctions of the minors.

40|$|The illegal {{deprivation}} of liberty is, under the current context, {{one of the most}} serious offenses, being treated differently in the European Union. The need to prevent and combat this violation, it has led the European legislator to include it under different names in the European legislative act that governs the institution of the European arrest warrant. In this context, the European arrest warrant is the most important form of judicial cooperation <b>in</b> <b>penal</b> <b>matters</b> between the Member States of the EU, which is based on mutualrecognition of criminal judgments. The research conducted on how it is regulated the enforcement of the European arrest warrant in the case of illegal liberty deprivation in the European legislative act (the Framework Decision 2002 / 584 /JHA) leads to the conclusion that the legislature failed to mention the violation in question in the group of the violation for which it was not necessary the inspection of the double incrimination, but, still, including the offenses as kidnapping, illegal restraint and hostage-taking. Even if theRomanian legislator included this violation in the above mentioned group, this situation is not solved, because it will cause some problems in the request by the Romanian judicial authorities of the enforcement of such warrant. Another criticized issue, observed not only in the European legislative act, but also in the internal law, is related to the lack of stipulations, which can lead to the possibility of issuing and executing a European arrest warrant and for the execution of educational measures for illegal {{deprivation of}} liberty and also others. Also, in order to increase the effectiveness of the execution of a European arrest warrant, we consider that it should be granted executive powers of all courts of Romania. The originality of the work consists of the critical observations and the lege ferenda proposal which covers both the European legislativeact and the Romanian Law. At the same time, the critical opinions are useful for the Romanian legislator that intends to supplement and amend the special law, and for the European one also for amending andsupplementing the European Framework Decision 2002 / 584 /JHA...|$|R
40|$|The {{system of}} Mixed Courts in Egypt {{was an unusual}} institution. It {{represented}} an international solution {{in the context of}} what was obviously a colonial situation. The system lasted 74 years from 1876 to 1949. A system of law was established whose sources were general codes created especially for use by the Mixed Courts. The Charter of the Mixed Courts specified two residual sources of law. It is these sources and their application upon which this paper is principally focused. Article 34 reads: 2 ̆ 2 The new Courts, in the exercise of their jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters, and within the limits of the jurisdiction conferred upon them <b>in</b> <b>penal</b> <b>matters,</b> shall apply the codes presented by Egypt to the Powers, and in case of silence, insufficiency, and obscurity of the law, the judge shall follow the principles of natural law and equity. 2 ̆ 2 The language of the Charter was incorporated into article 11 of the Mixed Civil Code of Egypt which stated: 2 ̆ 2 In case of silence, insufficiency, or obscurity of the law, the judge shall apply the principles of natural law and the rules of equity. 2 ̆ 2 Such a provision {{does not appear to have}} a counterpart in other modern legal systems. Neither the Swiss Civil Code nor any other European code permits the judge to make use of these sources of law as the entire basis for a judgment. The discussion of the application of article 34 of the Charter and article 11 of the Mixed Civil Code will be preceded by a description of the origins of the system of the Mixed Courts, of their jurisdiction and organization, of the background of the Mixed Codes, and of their content. The Mixed Courts operated under the original Charter from 1876 to 1937. The revision of the Charter in 1937, in preparation for the termination of the Mixed Courts which was to take place 12 years later, did not affect article 11 of the Civil Code. Article 52 of the revised Charter reaffirmed the use of natural law and equity in the same terms as article 34 of the original Charter. Whatever conclusions may be drawn from the use of natural law and equity by the Mixed Courts, the technique itself merits the attention of the jurisprude, the comparativist, and the expert in international law and transnational transactions...|$|R

40|$|Some {{crimes are}} so odious that {{committing}} them makes one hostis generis humani (an enemy of all mankind). Intuitively, {{the idea of}} a universal enemy implies the possibility of universal criminal jurisdiction (UCJ). As Luc Reydams notes, the notion of UCJ originated in the 16 th century with Covarruvias, although the idea is better known through Grotius 2 ̆ 7 s famous assertion that every state has jurisdiction over 2 ̆ 2 gross violations of the law of nature and of nations, done to other states and subjects 2 ̆ 2 (De Jure Belli ac Pacis, AC Campbell trans., II. 20. VII). For many years piracy was the only recognized UCJ crime, not so much because of its moral awfulness, but because it was committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of all states; and the pirate was the original hostis generis humani. In the 20 th century, a number of multilateral treaties established UCJ over other international crimes such as narcotics trafficking, counterfeiting, and aerial hijacking-crimes whose repression requires the efforts of many nations because they involve conduct that crosses borders. Typically, these treaties require parties (1) to enact domestic legislation criminalizing the conduct in question; (2) either to extradite suspects in their custody or prosecute them themselves (aut dedere aut prosequi); and (3) to establish criminal jurisdiction over the conduct regardless of where it is committed. It is the third requirement that creates UCJ - what Reydams calls 2 ̆ 7 cooperative 2 ̆ 7 UCJ, because the aut dedere aut prosequi clause suggests prosecution under UCJ is meant only 2 ̆ 2 to avoid an impasse which would otherwise result from the impossibility of extraditing a foreign suspect.

The exemption from taxes and imposts was frequently disputed by the city council and other officials.

The right of precedence at processions and funerals occasioned several bitter feuds between the officials of the episcopal court and the faculty. In 1610 Bishop Henry von Knöringen granted to the rector and the professors of theology the privilege of censorship; in 1747 this was modified to the effect that books printed in Dillingen needed also the approbation of the episcopal censor at Augsburg. The courses which, from the beginning, were given at the university and which were taken over by the Jesuits were humanities, philosophy, and theology. The humanities were taught in the gymnasium, which was at that time a part of the university, and they served as a preparation for the higher studies. In the beginning of the seventeenth century a faculty of jurisprudence was added with one professor of canon and one of civil law. In 1738 church history was included in the curriculum of theology.
