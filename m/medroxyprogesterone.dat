5|$|<b>Medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate, a progestin, {{has been}} shown to improve the {{ventilatory}} response, but this has been poorly studied and is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Similarly, the drug acetazolamide can reduce bicarbonate levels, and thereby augment to normal ventilatory response, but this has been researched insufficiently to recommend wide application.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} only {{beneficial}} in {{certain types of}} endometrial cancer. It was {{once thought to be}} beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, letrozole, megestrol acetate, and <b>medroxyprogesterone.</b> This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and/or progestin receptors. Progestin receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacological {{interventions}} {{are used to}} lower the sex drive in general, which can ease the management of pedophilic feelings, but does not change sexual preference. Antiandrogens work by interfering with the activity of testosterone. Cyproterone acetate (Androcur) and <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate (Depo-Provera) are the most commonly used. The efficacy of antiantrogens has some support, but few high-quality studies exist. Cyproterone acetate has the strongest evidence for reducing sexual arousal, while findings on <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate have been mixed.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone is {{relatively}} safe and well tolerated, {{and does not}} exhibit the androgenic side effects that are common with some other progestins, like <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate and norethisterone.|$|E
25|$|Relative to the {{progestin}} <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate, {{there are}} fewer reports of breast tenderness with progesterone and the magnitude and duration of vaginal bleeding is reportedly lower.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Pfizer and the Gates Foundation {{announced}} {{a joint effort}} to provide affordable access to Pfizer's long-lasting injectable contraceptive, <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate, to three million women in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there are}} many {{formulations}} of estradiol combined with one of various progestins, such as norethisterone (in Activelle, Novofem and Cliovelle), levonorgestrel, <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> (in Indivina), dienogest or drospirenone.|$|E
25|$|In general, pregnane {{derivatives}} (progesterone, dydrogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate, megestrol acetate, etc.) do not virilize even in high dose; testosterone derivatives (ethisterone) and 19-nortestosterone (norethisterone, norethisterone acetate, etc.) generally virilize, {{but there}} are exceptions (e.g. noretynodrel) that do not.|$|E
25|$|Depo-Provera (depot <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate, or DMPA) may be {{injected}} {{every three}} months {{just as it is}} used for contraception. Generally after the first cycle, menses are greatly reduced or eliminated. This may be useful for transgender men prior to initiation of testosterone therapy.|$|E
25|$|One {{portion of}} the {{parallel}} studies followed over 16,000 women {{for an average of}} 5.2 years, half of whom took placebo, while the other half took a combination of the progestin <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate (Provera) and conjugated equine estrogen (Premarin). The combination of hormones is referred to as Prempro.|$|E
25|$|In {{breast cancer}} survivors, non-hormonal birth control methods {{should be used}} as {{first-line}} options. Progestogen-based methods such as depot <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate, IUD with progestogen or progestogen only pills have a poorly investigated but possible increased risk of cancer recurrence, but may be used if positive effects outweigh this possible risk.|$|E
25|$|The use of progestins, in {{particular}} <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate, in treating post-menopausal symptoms {{have been associated}} with increased risk of blood clots and breast cancer in a study carried out by the Women's Health Initiative. While the study did not involve dydrogesterone, it is possible, but not certain, that it too increases these risks.|$|E
25|$|Mood changes, {{including}} depression, {{can occur}} with hormone replacement therapy. However, many transgender women report significant mood-lifting effects as well. The risk of depressive side effects {{is more common}} in patients who take progestins. <b>Medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate, in particular, has been shown to cause depression in certain individuals, perhaps by affecting dopamine levels.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{was first}} {{isolated}} in pure form in 1934. It first became {{available as a}} medication later that year. Oral micronized progesterone (OMP), which first allowed progesterone to be taken by mouth, was introduced in 1980. A large number of manufactured progestogens, or progestins, have been derived from progesterone and are used as medications as well. Examples include <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate and norethisterone.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that progesterone could prevent threatened abortion and might prevent habitual abortion, but oral bioavailability of progesterone {{is low and}} injections of progesterone can be painful, so orally active progestins were tried beginning with ethisterone, followed by other progestins as they became available: northynodrel (Enovid) and norethisterone (Norlutin) in 1957, <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate (Provera) in 1959, norethisterone acetate (Norlutate) in 1961, and dydrogesterone (Duphaston) in 1962.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{does not}} bind to the {{androgen}} receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and hence does not possess any direct androgenic or antiandrogenic activity. This {{is in contrast}} to many progestins, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives (e.g., norethisterone, dienogest) and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives (e.g., cyproterone acetate, <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate), which do bind to the AR and have been associated with androgenic or antiandrogenic effects depending on the progestin in question.|$|E
25|$|NET was {{previously}} available alone in 5mg tablets under {{the brand name}} Norlutin in the U.S., but this formulation has since been discontinued in this country. However, NETA remains available alone in 5mg tablets under the brand names Aygestin and Norlutate in the U.S. It {{is one of the}} only non-contraceptive progestogen-only drug formulations that remains available in the U.S. The others include progesterone, <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate, megestrol acetate, and hydroxyprogesterone caproate, as well as the atypical agent danazol.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of progestins (synthetic progestogens) have been derived from progesterone. They can be {{categorized}} into several structural groups, including derivatives of retroprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-methylprogesterone, and 19-norprogesterone, with a respective example from each group including dydrogesterone, <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate, medrogestone, and promegestone. Quingestrone (progesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether) is among the only examples that {{do not belong to}} any of these groups. Another major group of progestins, the 19-nortestosterone derivatives, exemplified by norethisterone (norethindrone) and levonorgestrel, are not derived from progesterone but rather from testosterone.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{specific}} dangers of conjugated equine estrogens were well understood, standard therapy was 0.625mg/day of conjugated equine estrogens (such as Premarin). There are, however, {{risks associated with}} conjugated equine estrogen therapy. Among the older postmenopausal women studied {{as part of the}} Women's Health Initiative (WHI), an orally administered conjugated equine estrogen supplement was found to be associated with an increased risk of dangerous blood clotting. The WHI studies used one type of estrogen supplement, a high oral dose of conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin alone and with <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate as PremPro).|$|E
25|$|The estrogen-alone substudy of the WHI {{reported}} {{an increased risk}} of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in postmenopausal women 50 years of age or older and {{an increased risk of}} dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older using 0.625mg of Premarin conjugated equine estrogens (CEE). The estrogen-plus-progestin substudy of the WHI {{reported an}} increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli and DVT in postmenopausal women 50 years of age or older and an increased risk of dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older using PremPro, which is 0.625mg of CEE with 2.5mg of the progestin <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate (MPA).|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} notable drug {{interactions}} with progesterone. Certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline {{may increase the}} GABAA receptor-related central depressant effects of progesterone by enhancing its conversion into 5α-dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone via activation of 3α-HSD. Progesterone potentiates the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and alcohol. Notably, there is a case report of progesterone abuse alone with very high doses. 5α-Reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride, as well as inhibitors of 3α-HSD such as <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate, inhibit the conversion of progesterone into its inhibitory neurosteroid metabolites, and for this reason, may {{have the potential to}} block or reduce its sedative effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} cause of Cushing's {{syndrome}} is the taking of glucocorticoids prescribed by a health care practitioner to treat other diseases (called iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome). This can be an effect of corticosteroid treatment of a variety of disorders such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, or in immunosuppression after an organ transplant. Administration of synthetic ACTH is also possible, but ACTH is less often prescribed due to cost and lesser utility. Although rare, Cushing's syndrome can also be due to the use of <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate. In this form of Cushing's, the adrenal glands atrophy due to lack of stimulation by ACTH, since glucocorticoids downregulate production of ACTH. Cushing's syndrome in childhood usually results from use of glucocorticoid medication.|$|E
25|$|Progestogens, in {{conjunction}} with the hormone prolactin, are involved in the maturation of the lobules, acini, and areola during pregnancy: mammary structures that estrogen has little to no direct effect on. However, there is no clinical evidence that progestogens enhance breast size, shape, or appearance in either transgender women or cisgender women, and one study found no benefit to breast hemicircumference over estrogen alone in a small sample of transgender women given both an estrogen and an oral progestogen (usually 10mg/day <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate). However, the authors of the paper stated that the sample size was too small to make any definitive conclusions, and that further studies should be carried out to confirm whether progestogens significantly affect breast size and/or shape in transgender women. As of 2014, no additional study had looked at the issue. Anecdotal evidence from transgender women suggests that those who take progesterone supplements may experience more full breast development, including stage IV on the Tanner scale (many transgender women do not develop Tanner stage V breasts). However, there have been no formal studies with sufficiently large sample sizes to confirm this.|$|E
2500|$|Alongside {{estrogen}} and antiandrogens, progesterone {{is used as}} a component of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for transgender women. However, the addition of progestogens to HRT for transgender women is controversial. Some clinicians and patients believe that progesterone is necessary for full breast development, and for this reason, it is often used with the intention of enhancing breast development. However, a 2014 review stated that [...] "Current evidence does not provide evidence that progestogens enhance breast development in [...] women. Neither do they prove the absence of such an effect." [...] Progestogens are not otherwise known to be involved in physical feminization. In addition, they can produce undesirable side effects, although bioidentical progesterone may be safer and better tolerated than progestins like <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate.|$|E
2500|$|Progesterone, a progestogen, is {{the other}} {{of the two major}} sex hormones in women. Unlike estrogen, {{progesterone}} is not overtly involved in the development of female secondary sexual characteristics, and is instead involved mainly in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. For this reason, progestogens are not commonly prescribed for transgender women. However, there may be a role of progestogens in breast development (though controversial and disputed) and in regulation of skin and hair, and progesterone specifically may have positive effects on sex drive, sleep, and levels of anxiety. Moreover, due to their antigonadotropic and/or antiandrogen effects, progestogens can be useful in helping to suppress the effects of androgens in the body. The most common progestogens used in transgender women include progesterone and progestins (synthetic progestogens) like [...] and <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate (MPA). These drugs are usually taken orally, but may also be administered by intramuscular injection.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{neither the}} WHI nor the Million Women Study {{differentiated}} {{the results for}} different types of synthetic progesterones used. [...] <b>Medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate (MPA) -- the type most commonly used in the United States—was the only one examined by the WHI, which in its analysis and conclusions extrapolated the benefits versus risks of MPA to all synthetic progesterones. [...] This conclusion has since been challenged by several researchers as unjustified and misleading, resulting in unreasonable, unnecessary avoidance by many women of HRT for menopause. [...] In fact, primate research indicates that {{the side effects of}} MPA may be much worse than those of other synthetic progesterones, and some human studies indicate that MPA may be responsible for negating the protective cardiac benefits of estrogen that were found for estrogen-only HRT users. [...] Critics including Bethea note that there are now research papers showing significantly better outcomes in brain, breast, and cardiovascular parameters with estradiol plus progesterone instead of MPA and conclude that further studies are needed to know more precisely what the differences in effects are when other synthetic progesterones are used versus natural progesterone in HRT for menopause, so that women aren't needlessly discouraged from seeking HRT for menopause.|$|E
50|$|The {{improved}} {{potency of}} dimethisterone due to 6α-methylation reportedly {{served as the}} basis for the synthesis of <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate. Whereas hydroxyprogesterone acetate (the 6α-demethylated analogue of <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate) is around twice as potent as ethisterone orally, <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate shows 10 to 25 times the potency of ethisterone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Medroxyprogesterone</b> (abbreviated as MP), {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Controlestril, is a {{progestin}} which is used in veterinary medicine in France to control estrus in animals. A derivative, <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate (MPA), {{is used as a}} medication in humans, and is far more widely known in comparison. Compared to MPA, MP is over two orders of magnitude less potent as a progestogen. MP is also notable in that it is a metabolite of MPA. <b>Medroxyprogesterone</b> is sometimes used as a synonym for <b>medroxyprogesterone</b> acetate, and what is almost always being referred to when the term is used is MPA and not MP.|$|E
