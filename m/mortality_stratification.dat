40|$|Rationale: Biomarkers for {{survival}} in {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS) would facilitate the development of novel drugs. Although respiratory muscle weakness is a known predictor of poor prognosis, a comprehensive comparison of different tests is lacking. Objectives: To compare the predictive power of invasive and noninvasive respiratory muscle strength assessments {{for survival}} or ventilator-free survival, up to 3 years. Methods: From a previously published report respiratory muscle strength measurements were available for 78 patients with ALS. Time to death and/or ventilation were ascertained. Receiver operating characteristic {{analysis was used to}} determine the cutoff point of each parameter. Measurements and Main Results: Each respiratory muscle strength assessment individually achieved statistical significance for prediction of survival or ventilator-free survival. In multivariate analysis sniff trans-diaphragmatic and esophageal pressure, twitch trans-diaphragmatic pressure (Tw Pdi), age, and maximal static expiratory mouth pressure were significant predictors of ventilation-free survival and Tw Pdi and maximal static expiratory mouth pressure for absolute survival. Although all measures had good specificity, there were differing sensitivities. All cutoff points for the VC were greater than 80 % of normal, except for prediction of 3 -month outcomes. Sequential data showed a linear decline for direct measures of respiratory muscle strength, whereas VC showed little to no decline until 12 months before death/ventilation. Conclusions: The most powerful biomarker for <b>mortality</b> <b>stratification</b> was Tw Pdi, but the predictive power of sniff nasal inspiratory pressure was also excellent. A VC within normal range suggested a good prognosis at 3 months but was of little other value...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: -Eisenmenger {{syndrome}} (ES) {{is associated}} with substantial morbidity and mortality. There is no consensus, however, on <b>mortality</b> risk <b>stratification.</b> We aimed to investigate survival and predictors of death in a large, contemporary cohort of ES patients. METHODS: -We identified in a multicentre approach adults with ES under follow-up between 2000 and 2015. We examined survival and its association with clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and laboratory parameters. RESULTS: -We studied 1098 patients (median age 34. 4 years, range 16. 1 - 84. 4 years, 65. 1 % female, 31. 9 % with Down syndrome). The majority had a post-tricuspid defect (n= 643, 58. 6 %), followed by patients with a complex (n= 315, 28. 7 %) and pre-tricuspid lesion (n=, 12. 7 %). Over a median follow-up of 3. 1 years [IQR 1. 4 - 5. 9], allowing for 4361. 6 patient-years observation, 278 patients died and six and six underwent transplantation. Twelve parameters emerged as significant predictors of death on univariable analysis. On multivariable Cox regression analysis only age (HR 1. 41 / 10 years, 95 %CI 1. 24 - 1. 59, P< 0. 001), pre-tricuspid shunt (HR 1. 56, 95 %CI 1. 02 - 2. 39, P= 0. 041), oxygen saturation at rest (HR 0. 53 / 10 %, 95 %CI 0. 43 - 0. 65, P< 0. 001), presence of sinus rhythm (HR 0. 53, 95 %CI 0. 32 - 0. 88, P= 0. 013) and presence of pericardial effusion (HR 2. 41, 95 %CI 1. 59 - 3. 66, P< 0. 001) remained significant predictors of death.

40|$|The fate of {{reactive}} tracers {{is often}} modelled by depth-averaged equations. When integrating the depth-resolved equations, {{it appears that}} the term describing the settling of particles is dependent on the concentration just above the bottom. Because in a depth-averaged framework this quantity is not available, the settling term needs to be parameterised. The most natural choice is to make the settling flux dependent on the average concentration. This approximation is acceptable if the water column is well mixed, but these conditions are not necessarily met in real applications. Therefore, this study aims at assessing and understanding the error made by using a depth-averaged model in a range of realistic conditions. For the definition of these conditions, typical values for the Scheldt Estuary and the Dutch-Belgian coast were taken. The realistic inspiration for the reactive tracer in this study is the fecal bacterium Escherichia coli, whose own dynamics are characterised by settling and gradual decay by mortality. In an attempt to understand the relative importance of several factors like settling, <b>mortality,</b> mixing and <b>stratification</b> on the error made by a depth-averaged approach, a number of simplified test cases were investigated. It follows that, as expected, the error is acceptable if the situation is mixing-dominated. However, the effect of <b>mortality</b> and <b>stratification</b> was less obvious in advance. For instance, it appeared that errors can also be significant if settling and mortality have the same characteristic timescales.

30|$|Sepsis {{definitions}} {{based on}} SIRS criteria have, though, been questioned as of late, as SIRS {{has been shown}} to be present in 93 % of all patients admitted to intensive care (and therefore overly non-specific) [5]. Furthermore, up to 1 in every 8 patients with infection and organ dysfunction do not meet SIRS criteria [6]. Moreover, the methodology used to capture SIRS criteria may lead to substantial variability in defining sepsis cases [7, 8]. These and other concerns have led to the development and publication of new sepsis definitions (Sepsis- 3), which were derived through a data-driven <b>mortality</b> risk <b>stratification</b> [9 – 11]. Although these new criteria have been validated in large databases, much controversy still surrounds them. Some criticisms include the new definitions’ lack of validation in scenarios outside of high-income countries, and their non-utilization of lactate as a marker of organ dysfunction [12 – 16].|$|R

As symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) impacts vascular tension and integrity via modulating nitric oxide (NO) pathways, we investigated circulating SDMA in critical illness and sepsis. 247 critically ill patients (160 with sepsis, 87 without sepsis) were studied prospectively upon {{admission to the}} medical intensive care unit (ICU) and on day 7, in comparison to 84 healthy controls. SDMA serum levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients at admission to ICU compared to controls and remained stably elevated {{during the first week}} of ICU treatment. The highest SDMA levels were found in patients with sepsis. SDMA levels closely correlated with disease severity scores, biomarkers of inflammation, and organ failure (renal, hepatic, and circulatory). We identified SDMA serum concentrations at admission as an independent prognostic biomarker in critically ill patients not only for short-term mortality at the ICU but also for unfavourable long-term survival. Thus, the significant increase of circulating SDMA in critically ill patients indicates a potential pathogenic involvement in endothelial dysfunction during sepsis and may be useful for <b>mortality</b> risk <b>stratification</b> at the ICU...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: To assess whether, in {{contemporary}} patients with {{renal cell carcinoma}} (RCC), access to nephrectomy is the same between the Blacks and Whites, {{and that there is}} no difference in <b>mortality</b> after <b>stratification</b> for treatment type. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The effect of race has received little attention in RCC; only two reports have addressed and suggested the presence of racial disparities, including access to nephrectomy and survival after nephrectomy, where Black patients were disadvantaged relative to Whites. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results data from 12 516 patients of all stages diagnosed and treated for RCC between 2000 and 2004. The effect of race (Black vs White) on nephrectomy rate was addressed in logistic regression and binomial regression models, and Cox regression models tested the effect of race on overall survival. RESULTS: Black patients were 50 % less likely to have a nephrectomy than their White counterparts. However, race had no effect on overall survival when the entire cohort was assessed, as well as in subgroups of patients with or without nephrectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Although race is a determinant of access to nephrectomy, it should not be interpreted as a barrier to care, as survival was unaffected by race in patients having a nephrectomy or not. Instead, race might represent a proxy of comorbidity and life-expectancy, which represent surgical selection criteria for nephrectomy...|$|R

This instrument's predictive value for survival {{has not been}} rigorously evaluated among lung transplantation recipients. Methods: We reviewed medical records of all patients who underwent lung transplantation at Mayo Clinic, Rochester from 2000 - 2012. A transplant psychiatrist had assessed lung transplant candidates for psychosocial risk with the PACT scale. Recipients were divided into high-and low psychosocial risk cohorts using a PACT score cutoff of 2. The main outcome variable was posttransplant survival. Mortality was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: This study included 110 lung recipients: 57 (51. 8 %) were females, 101 (91. 8 %) Whites, mean age: 56. 4 years. Further, 7 (6. 4 %) recipients received an initial PACT score = 2 (acceptable, good or great candidates). An initial PACT score < 2 was modestly associated with higher mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 2. 73, p = 0. 04). Conclusions: Lung transplant recipients who initially received a low score on the PACT scale, reflecting poor or borderline psychosocial candidacy, experienced greater likelihood of mortality.

Two survival analyses were performed: (1) a retrospective study, including 400 patients with COPD none of whom had received nutritional therapy; (2) a post hoc analysis of a prospective study, including 203 patients with COPD who had participated in a randomized placebocontrolled trial. There was no overlap between the patient groups. Baseline characteristics of all patients were collected on admission to a pulmonary rehabilitation center in stable clinical condition. In the prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial, the physiologic effects of nutritional therapy alone (n � 71) or in combination with anabolic steroid treatment (n � 67) after 8 wk was studied in patients with COPD prestratified into a depleted group and a nondepleted group. Mortality was assessed as overall mortality. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to quantify the relationship between the baseline variables age, sex, spirometry, arterial blood gases, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and subsequent overall mortality. Additionally, the influence of treatment response on mortality was investigated in the prospective study.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to review the outcomes of patients who had received coronary stenting before CABG, and to examine the validity of a <b>mortality</b> risk <b>stratification</b> system in this patient group. Methods: From 2010 to 2012, 439 patients who underwent isolated CABG at our medical center were reviewed. The patients were divided into two study groups: those who had previously received coronary artery stenting (97 patients, 24. 7 %), and those who had not (342 patients, 75. 3 %). The patients who received balloon angioplasty were excluded. Results: There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. The prior stenting group had a lower risk of mortality, although the difference was not significant. The prior stenting group had fewer graft anastomoses (p =  0. 005), and hence a significantly shorter cardiopulmonary bypass time (p =  0. 045) and shorter aortic cross-clamping time. Surgical mortality was similar between the two groups. The durations of intensive care unit stay and hospitalization were also similar. The discriminatory power of the logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) was lower in both group.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{size and}} number of tumors are {{important}} prognostic indicators for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, {{it is difficult to}} assess the prognosis for patients with a variable number and size of tumors. By combining these two factors, we investigated the role and prognostic accuracy of total tumor volume (TTV) for HCC. Methods A total of 786 patients undergoing locoregional therapy (transarterial chemoembolization, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation and acetic acid or ethanol injection) for HCC were prospectively evaluated. Results The mean and median TTV was 177 cm 3 (range, 0. 1 - 3, 591 cm 3) and 21 cm 3, respectively. Of all, 38 %, 29 %, 15 %, 7 % and 11 % of patients had TTV of 3, 10 - 50 cm 3, 50 - 200 cm 3, 200 - 500 cm 3 and > 500 cm 3, respectively. TTV was significantly larger in patients with higher serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels or with vascular invasion. The Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, performance status, vascular invasion, AFP level and TTV were significant independent prognostic predictors in the Cox proportional hazards model. After adjustment, patients with TTV 50 - 200 cm 3 (relative risk [RR]: 1. 74, p = 0. 009), 200 - 500 cm 3 (RR: 2. 15, p = 0. 006) and > 500 cm 3 (RR: 3. 92, p 3.

However, {{little is known about}} the outcome of non-inducible patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of PES for <b>mortality</b> risk <b>stratification</b> in patients with ICM. Methods: All consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria (history of coronary artery disease, LVEF≤ 35 %, and absence of documented spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia or aborted sudden cardiac death) were included in the study.

Methods: All participants >= 18 years participating in the Lifelines population, a three- generation Cohort Study and Biobank, were included (n= 152, 180). Participants with unrecognized MI were matched with controls without MI (1 : 2) based on age and gender. Unrecognized MI was defined when no history of MI was reported in combinationwith electrocardiographic (ECG) signs corresponding to MI. A history ofMIwas defined as a reported history of MI in combination with ECG signs and/ or the use of antithrombotic medication. Results: MI was present in 1881 (1. 2 %) of participants and was unrecognized in 431 (22. 9 %) participants. Under the age of 50 years, percentages of unrecognized MI relative to the total amount of MI were 34 % and 55 % in men and women respectively. Compared to recognized MI, classical cardiovascular risk factors were less prevalent in participants with unrecognized MI. During a median follow- up time of 5, 4 and 4 years, 4. 4 %, 6. 4 % and 2. 2 % of participants with unrecognizedMI, recognized MI and without MI died, respectively. In a multivariable logistic regression unrecognized MI was an independent predictor of death. Conclusions: The prevalence of unrecognized MI is substantial and classical cardiovascular risk factors are less prevalent in participants with unrecognized MI.

However, their application to biomedical text classification, particularly to <b>mortality</b> risk <b>stratification</b> among intensive care unit (ICU) patients, has not been thoroughly studied. ObjectiveTo develop and characterize sparse classifiers based on the free text of nursing notes in order to predict ICU mortality risk and to discover text features most strongly associated with mortality. MethodsWe selected nursing notes from the first 24 h of ICU admission for 25, 826 adult ICU patients from the MIMIC-II database. We then developed a pair of stochastic gradient descent-based classifiers with elastic-net regularization. We also studied the performance-sparsity tradeoffs of both classifiers as their regularization parameters were varied. ResultsThe best-performing classifier achieved a 10 -fold cross-validated AUC of 0. 897 under the log loss function and full L 2 regularization, while full L 1 regularization used just 0. 00025 % of candidate input features and resulted in an AUC of 0. 889. Using the log loss (range of AUCs 0. 889 – 0. 897) yielded better performance compared to the hinge loss (0. 850 – 0. 876), but the latter yielded even sparser models. DiscussionMost features selected by both classifiers appear clinically relevant and correspond to predictors already present in existing ICU mortality models. The sparser classifiers were also able to discover a number of informative – albeit nonclinical – features.

Using data on mortality for U.

As a result, racial differences in IQRo have dynamically diverged and converged while there has been a century of convergence in eo.

40|$|ObjectiveRecent {{studies with}} {{asymptomatic}} carotid patients on best medical management {{have shown that}} the annual risk of stroke has decreased to approximately 1 %. There is no evidence that a similar decrease in mortality has occurred. In addition, the intensity of statin therapy for these patients has not yet been determined. The aims of this review were to determine (a) the reported long-term all-cause and cardiac-related mortality in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS)  >  50 %, (b) whether there has been a decrease in mortality in recent years, (c) the available methods of <b>mortality</b> risk <b>stratification,</b> and (d) whether the latest ACC/AHA guidelines on the treatment of serum lipids can be applied to this group of patients. MethodsSystematic review of PubMed, EuroPubMed, and Cochrane Library and meta-analysis using random effects for pooled proportions were performed regarding long-term all-cause and cardiac-related mortality and the associated risk factors in ACS patients. The last day for literature search was October 30, 2014. ResultsSeventeen studies were retrieved reporting 5 -year all-cause mortality in 11, 391 patients with ACS > 50 %. The 5 -year cumulative all-cause mortality across all 17 studies was 23. 6 % (95 % CI 20. 50 – 26. 80). Twelve additional studies, reporting both all-cause and cardiac mortality with a minimum of 2 year follow-up and involving 4, 072 patients were identified. Of the 930 deaths reported, 589 (62. 9 %; 95 % CI 58. 81 – 66. 89) were cardiac-related. This translates into an average cardiac-related mortality of 2. 9 % per year.

This retrospective study investigated the association between anticytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A antibody status and clinical, serological and histopathological features to explore the utility of this antibody to identify inclusion body myositis subgroups and to predict prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from various European inclusion body myositis registries were pooled. Anticytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A status was determined by an established ELISA technique. Cases were stratified according to antibody status and comparisons made. Survival and mobility aid requirement analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Data from 311 patients were available for analysis; 102 (33 %) had anticytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A antibodies. Antibody-positive patients had a higher adjusted mortality risk (HR 1. 89, 95 % CI 1. 11 to 3. 21, p= 0. 019), lower frequency of proximal upper limb weakness at disease onset (8 % vs 23 %, adjusted OR 0. 29, 95 % CI 0. 12 to 0. 68, p= 0. 005) and an increased prevalence of excess of cytochrome oxidase deficient fibres on muscle biopsy analysis (87 % vs 72 %, adjusted OR 2. 80, 95 % CI 1. 17 to 6. 66, p= 0. 020), compared with antibody-negative patients. INTERPRETATION: Differences were observed in clinical and histopathological features between anticytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A antibody positive and negative patients with inclusion body myositis, and antibody-positive patients had a higher adjusted <b>mortality</b> risk. <b>Stratification</b> of inclusion body myositis by anticytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 A antibody status may be useful, potentially highlighting a distinct inclusion body myositis subtype with a more severe phenotype...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} the impact of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in patients with familial arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). BackgroundArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is a cause of sudden cardiac death, which may be prevented by ICD. MethodsWe studied 11 families in which a 3 p 25 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) haplotype at locus ARVD 5 segregated with disease and compared mortality in subjects who received an ICD with that in control subjects who were matched for age, gender, ARVC status, and family. Subjects (n = 367) at 50 % a priori risk of inheriting ARVC were classified as high risk (HR) (n = 197), low risk (n = 92), or unknown (n = 78) {{on the basis of}} clinical events, DNA haplotyping, and/or pedigree position. Forty-eight HR subjects (30 males, [median age 32 years] and 18 females [median age 41 years]) were followed after ICD (secondary to ventricular tachycardia [VT] in 27 %). Survival was compared with 58 HR control subjects who were alive at the same age to-the-day at which the ICD subject received the device. ResultsIn the HR group, 50 % of males were dead by 39 years and females by 71 years: relative risk of death was 5. 1 (95 % confidence interval 3 to 8. 5) for males. The five-year mortality rate after ICD in males was zero compared with 28 % in control subjects (p = 0. 009). Within five years, the ICD fired for VT in 70 % and for VT > 240 beats/min in 30 %, with no difference in discharge rate when analyzed by ICD indication. ConclusionsThe unknown mutation at the ARVD 5 locus causing ARVC results in high <b>mortality.</b> Risk <b>stratification</b> using genetic haplotyping and ICD therapy produced improved survival for males...|$|R
40|$|Objective Patients with {{repaired}} tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) have {{an increased}} long-term risk of cardiovascular morbidity and <b>mortality.</b> Risk <b>stratification</b> in this population is difficult. Initial evidence suggests that cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) {{may be helpful to}} risk-stratify patients with repaired ToF. Methods and results We studied 875 patients after surgical repair for ToF (358 females, age 25. 5 ± 11. 7 year, range 7 - 75 years) who underwent CPET between 1999 and 2009. During a mean follow-up of 4. 1 ± 2. 6 years after CPET, 30 patients (3. 4 %) died or had sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). 225 patients (25. 7 %) had other cardiac related events (emergency admission, surgery, or catheter interventions). On multivariable Cox regression-analysis, %predicted peak oxygen uptake (V O 2 %) (p = 0. 001), resting QRS duration (p = 0. 030) and age (p < 0. 001) emerged as independent predictors of mortality or sustained VT. Patients with a peak VO 2 65 % of predicted and a resting QRS duration 170 ms had a 11. 4 -fold risk of death or sustained VT. Ventilatory efficiency expressed as VE/VCO 2 slope (p 0. 001), peak VO 2 % (p =. 001), QRS duration (p =. 001) and age (p = 0. 046) independently predicted event free survival. VE/VCO 2 slope 31. 0, peak VO 2 % 65 % and QRS duration 170 ms were the cut-off points with best sensitivity and specificity to detect an unfavorable outcome. Conclusions CPET is an important predictive tool that may assist in the risk stratification of patients with ToF. Subjects with a poor exercise capacity in addition to a prolonged QRS duration have a substantially increased risk for death or sustained ventricular tachycardia, as well as for cardiac-related hospitalizations...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: New {{scores have}} been {{developed}} and validated in the US for in-hospital <b>mortality</b> risk <b>stratification</b> in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty: the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) risk score and the Mayo Clinic Risk Score (MCRS). We sought to validate these scores in a European population with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and to compare their predictive accuracy {{with that of the}} GRACE risk score. METHODS: In a single-center ACS registry of patients undergoing coronary angioplasty, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), a graphical representation of observed vs. expected mortality, and net reclassification improvement (NRI) /integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analysis to compare the scores. RESULTS: A total of 2148 consecutive patients were included, mean age 63 years (SD 13), 74 % male and 71 % with ST-segment elevation ACS. In-hospital mortality was 4. 5 %. The GRACE score showed the best AUC (0. 94, 95 % CI 0. 91 - 0. 96) compared with NCDR (0. 87, 95 % CI 0. 83 - 0. 91, p= 0. 0003) and MCRS (0. 85, 95 % CI 0. 81 - 0. 90, p= 0. 0003). In model calibration analysis, GRACE showed the best predictive power. With GRACE, patients were more often correctly classified than with MCRS (NRI 78. 7, 95 % CI 59. 6 - 97. 7; IDI 0. 136, 95 % CI 0. 073 - 0. 199) or NCDR (NRI 79. 2, 95 % CI 60. 2 - 98. 2; IDI 0. 148, 95 % CI 0. 087 - 0. 209). CONCLUSION: The NCDR and Mayo Clinic risk scores are useful for risk <b>stratification</b> of in-hospital <b>mortality</b> in a European population of patients with ACS undergoing coronary angioplasty. However, the GRACE score is still to be preferred...|$|R
40|$|Background: Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery, as {{measured}} by troponin elevation, is strongly associated with mortality. However, it is unknown in which patients prognosis can be improved. The presence of kinetic changes of troponin {{may be associated with}} a worse prognosis and warrant more aggressive management. Therefore, we aimed to study the kinetics of troponin in patients with postoperative myocardial injury, and to determine the added predictive value of kinetic changes of troponin on mortality. Methods: This cohort study included patients with myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery. Troponin I (TnI) w{{as measured}} on the first three postoperative days. The primary outcome was all-cause 1 -year mortality. We studied both absolute and relative TnI changes, and determined the delta TnI that was associated with mortality to distinguish a rise-and-fall TnI pattern from a stable TnI pattern. Next, we determined the added predictive value of a rise-and-fall TnI pattern for mortality. Results: In total, 634 patients were included. The risk ratio (RR) for mortality increased significantly with an absolute delta TnI of ≥ 200 ng/L (RR 1. 5, 99. 4 % CI 1. 0. 2. 2, p = 0. 003). Using this delta TnI to define a rise-and-fall pattern, 459 patients (72 %) had a stable TnI pattern and 175 patients (28 %) had a rise-and-fall pattern. When added to a model including the highest TnI value and variables from the revised cardiac risk index (RCRI), the TnI pattern did not increase the predictive value for mortality. Conclusions: A postoperative TnI rise-and-fall pattern was associated with 1 -year mortality, but had no added value in addition to the highest TnI level to predict 1 -year mortality. Therefore, postoperative TnI kinetics are not useful for further <b>mortality</b> risk <b>stratification</b> in patients with myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Association between {{body mass}} index (BMI) and {{long-term}} mortality is poorly studied in older hospitalized populations. METHODS: The researchers prospectively studied {{the impact of the}} BMI, comorbidities, and malnutrition on long-term mortality in 444 patients (mean age 85. 3 +/- 6. 7 years; 74. 0 % women) receiving geriatric inpatient care. All-cause mortality was determined using simple and multiple Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Higher BMI was associated with a higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure, but with a lower prevalence of malignancies. Four-year all-cause mortality was inversely associated with a BMI {{greater than or equal to}} 30 kg/m(2) (hazard ratio = 0. 59, p =. 037) and positively associated with age, male gender, several individual comorbidities, and the global disease load determined by the Cumulative Illness Rating scale. The inverse association between a BMI greater than or equal to 30 and mortality remained significant after adjustment for age, gender, smoking, individual comorbidities (including heart failure and malignancies), Cumulative Illness Rating scale scores, and malnutrition parameters (hazard ratio = 0. 52, p =. 015). One-year mortality was associated with the Cumulative Illness Rating scale score but not with BMI categories. There were no survival differences between patients in low (< 20. 0) and intermediate (20. 0 - 24. 9 and 25. 0 - 29. 9) BMI categories. CONCLUSIONS: A BMI greater than or equal to 30 is associated with better long-term survival in hospitalized older patients, even after extensive adjustment for comorbidities, malnutrition, and smoking. Conversely, a low BMI (< 20 - 25) is not associated with excess mortality, likely due to the overriding impact of multiple comorbidities. The researchers' observations have important implications for the <b>mortality</b> risk <b>stratification</b> in older high-risk patients...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionThe {{functional}} {{significance of}} pulmonary hypertension (PH) in COPD is unclear. The {{purpose of the}} study was to define the prevalence, severity and associated functional impact of PH in patients with severe COPD listed for lung transplant. MethodsA retrospective review of the Organ Procurement and Tissue Network (OPTN) database between 1997 and 2006 for patients with the primary diagnosis of COPD. Baseline demographics, hemodynamics, pulmonary function tests, six minute walk distance test (6 MWD) and pre-transplant survival data was analyzed. Results 4930 patients with COPD had evaluable right heart catheterization data (RHC). PH was present in 30. 4 %, with pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH) accounting for an additional 17. 2 % of patients. Patients with pulmonary hypertension walked an average of 28  m less than those with normal hemodynamics. Normal hemodynamics group: 261  ±  104  m, PH; 238  ±  106  m (p <  0. 01), PVH: 228  ±  104  m (p <  0. 05). In a multivariable analysis, the mean pulmonary artery pressure (β = − 1. 33; p =  0. 01) was an independent predictor of a reduced 6 MWD, as were forced vital capacity (β =  1. 48; p <  0. 001) and patient age (β = − 1. 91; p <  0. 001). Both PH (HR 1. 23 95 %CI [1. 01 – 1. 50]) and PVH (HR 1. 35 95 %CI [1. 11 – 1. 65]) were shown to be independent risk factors for mortality on the waiting list, even after adjustment for age sex, race, BMI, lung function, severity of illness and diabetes (PH: HR 1. 27; 95 %CI [1. 04 – 1. 55], PVH: HR 1. 40; 95 %CI [1. 13 – 1. 73]). ConclusionPH is common in advanced COPD and is associated with functional impairment and an increased <b>mortality</b> risk. <b>Stratification</b> by RHC determined pulmonary hemodynamics appears important in distinguishing distinct clinical phenotypes...|$|R
40|$|Right Atrial Volume Index (RAVI) {{measured}} by echocardiography {{is an independent}} predictor of morbidity in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the predictive value of RAVI assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) for all-cause mortality in patients with HFrEF and to assess its additive contribution to the validated Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic heart failure (MAGGIC) score. We identified 243 patients (mean age 60 ± 15; 33 % women) with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35 % {{measured by}} CMR. Right atrial volume was calculated based on area in two- and four -chamber views using validated equation, followed by indexing to body surface area. MAGGIC score was calculated using online calculator. During mean period of 2. 4 years 33 patients (14 %) died. The mean RAVI was 53 ± 26 ml/m 2; significantly larger in patients with than without an event (78. 7 ± 29 ml/m 2 vs. 48 ± 22 ml/m 2, p< 0. 001). RAVI (per ml/m 2) was an independent predictor of mortality [HR = 1. 03 (1. 01 - 1. 04), p = 0. 001]. RAVI has a greater discriminatory ability than LVEF, left atrial volume index and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) (C-statistic 0. 8 ± 0. 08 vs 0. 55 ± 0. 1, 0. 62 ± 0. 11, 0. 68 ± 0. 11, respectively, all p< 0. 02). The addition of RAVI to the MAGGIC score significantly improves risk stratification (integrated discrimination improvement 13 %, and category-free net reclassification improvement 73 %, both p< 0. 001). RAVI by CMR is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with HFrEF. The addition of RAVI to MAGGIC score improves <b>mortality</b> risk <b>stratification...</b>|$|R

Results. 147, 167 patients were analyzed, 5. 9 % were female. The most common risk classification was yellow (47. 4 %), followed by green (36. 5 %), orange (14. 2 %), blue (1. 3 %) and red (0. 6 %). The mean length of stay was less than one day in 95. 4 % of patients who were discharged from the hospital. Thirty percent of the patients classified as red, 2 % of those classified as orange, and 0. 3 % of those classified as yellow died. There was direct a relationship between the severity of patient classification and the length of hospital stay. Conclusion.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to derive and {{validate}} a model to predict survival in candidates for HeartMate II (HMII) (Thoratec, Pleasanton, California) left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. BackgroundLVAD mortality risk prediction is important for candidate selection and communicating expectations to patients and clinicians. With the evolution of LVAD support, prior risk prediction models have become less valid. MethodsPatients enrolled into the HMII bridge to transplantation and destination therapy trials (N = 1, 122) were randomly divided into derivation (DC) (n = 583) and validation cohorts (VC) (n = 539). Pre-operative candidate predictors of 90 -day mortality were examined in the DC with logistic regression, from which the HMII Risk Score (HMRS) was derived. The HMRS was then applied to the VC. ResultsThere were 149 (13 %) deaths within 90 days. In the DC, mortality (n = 80) was higher in older patients (odds ratio [OR]: 1. 3, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 1 to 1. 7 per 10 years), those with greater hypoalbuminemia (OR: 0. 49, 95 % CI: 0. 31 to 0. 76 per mg/dl of albumin), renal dysfunction (OR: 2. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 4 to 3. 2 per mg/dl creatinine), coagulopathy (OR: 3. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 7 to 5. 8 per international normalized ratio unit), and in those receiving LVAD support at less experienced centers (OR: 2. 2, 95 % CI: 1. 2 to 4. 4 for < 15 trial patients). Mortality in the DC low, medium, and high HMRS groups was 4 %, 16 %, and 29 %, respectively (p < 0. 001). In the VC, corresponding mortality was 8 %, 11 %, and 25 %, respectively (p < 0. 001). HMRS discrimination was good (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0. 71, 95 % CI: 0. 66 to 0. 75). ConclusionsThe HMRS might be useful for <b>mortality</b> risk <b>stratification</b> in HMII candidates and may serve as an additional tool in the patient selection process...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{assessed}} {{the potential of}} risk stratification of ARDS patients using SpO 2 /FiO 2 and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at ARDS onset and after 24  h. Methods: We used data from a prospective observational study in patients admitted to a mixed medical–surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in the Netherlands. Risk stratification was by cutoffs for SpO 2 /FiO 2 and PEEP. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Patients with moderate or severe ARDS with a length of stay of >  24  h were included in this study. Patients were assigned to four predefined risk groups: group I (SpO 2 /FiO 2  ≥  190 and PEEP <  10  cm H 2 O), group II (SpO 2 /FiO 2  ≥  190 and PEEP ≥  10  cm), group III (SpO 2 /FiO 2  <  190 and PEEP <  10  cm H 2 O) and group IV (SpO 2 /FiO 2  <  190 and PEEP ≥  10  cm H 2 O). Results: The analysis included 456 patients. SpO 2 /FiO 2 and PaO 2 /FiO 2 had a strong relationship (P <  0. 001, R 2  =  0. 676) that could be described in a linear regression equation (SpO 2 /FiO 2  =  42. 6  +  1. 0  * PaO 2 /FiO 2). Risk stratification at initial ARDS diagnosis resulted in groups that had no differences in in-hospital <b>mortality.</b> Risk <b>stratification</b> at 24  h resulted in groups with increasing mortality rates. The association between group assignment at 24  h and outcome was confounded by several factors, including APACHE IV scores, arterial pH and plasma lactate levels, and vasopressor therapy. Conclusions: In this cohort of patients with moderate or severe ARDS, SpO 2 /FiO 2 and PaO 2 /FiO 2 have a strong linear relationship. In contrast to risk stratification at initial ARDS diagnosis, risk stratification using SpO 2 /FiO 2 and PEEP after 24  h resulted in groups with worsening outcomes. Risk stratification using SpO 2 /FiO 2 and PEEP could be practical, especially in resource-limited settings...|$|R
