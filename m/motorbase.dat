25|$|For 2009, rumours {{had placed}} Thompson with a {{possible}} return to the BTCC after discussions with Team Dynamics to race one of their Honda Civics. He also tested a Tempus Sport Chevrolet Lacetti and a <b>Motorbase</b> Performance BMW 320si. However, his name was missing from the pre-season entry list, and it was later announced he would spend another year in the Danish series. It was then announced in April, prior to the Thruxton round that {{he would return to}} the BTCC, replacing Gordon Shedden. He collected a double win at Donington Park, and added a third win at Oulton Park. After the round at Knockhill, Thompson was replaced by ex-Formula One driver Johnny Herbert due to clashes with his commitments in the WTCC and V8 Supercars.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{hardware-in-the-loop}} simulation of urban electric vehicles. The proposed platform, {{which is expected}} to be used for electric vehicle prototyping, is very simple and effective. Indeed, the induction <b>motorbased</b> powertrain is coupled to DC machine-based load torque emulator taking into account the electric vehicle mechanics and aerodynamics. Experiments are carried-out using the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) to show that the proposed hardware-in-the-loop simulation system is effective and provides a simple configuration for prototyping electric vehicles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila no {{distributive}} disjunction (nod) gene encodes a kinesin-like {{protein that}} has been proposed to push chromosomes toward the metaphase plate during female meiosis. We report that the nonmotor domain of the nod protein can mediate direct binding to DNA. Using an antiserum prepared against bacterially expressed nod protein, we show that during prometaphase nod protein is localized on oocyte chromosomes and is not restricted to either specific chromosomal regions or to the kinetochore. Thus, <b>motorbased</b> chromosome-microtubule interactions {{are not limited to}} the centromere, but extend along the chromosome arms, providing a molecular explanation for the polar ejection force...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a device for the Position and Orientation (P&O) {{reconstruction}} of human segmental locomotion tasks. It {{is based on}} three mono-axial accelerometers and three angular velocity sensors, geometrically arranged to form two orthogonal terns. The device was bench tested using step-by-step <b>motorbased</b> equipment. The characteristics of the six channels under bench test conditions were: crosstalk absent, non linearity H, 1 % fs, hysteresis H, 1 % fs, accuracy 0, 3 % fs, overall resolution better than 0, 04 deg/s, P IH R. The device was validated with the stereophotogrammetric body motion analyzer during the execution of three different locomotion tasks: stand-to-sit, sit-to-stand, gait-initiation. Results obtained comparing the trajectories of the two methods showed that the errors were lower than 3 IH P � and 2 deg during a 4 s of acquisition and lower than 6 IH Q � and 0. 2 deg during the effective duration of a locomotory task; showing that the wearable device hereby presented permits the 3 -D reconstruction of {{the movement of the}} body segment to which it is affixed for time-limited clinical applications. Index Terms—Accelerometer, accuracy, human movement analysis, simulation, 3 -D rigid body position and orientation. I...|$|R

40|$|Researchers have {{interpreted}} the behaviours {{of individuals with}} acquired apraxia of speech (AOS) as impairment of linguistic phonological processing, motor control, or both. Acoustic, kinematic, and perceptual studies of speech in more recent years have led to significant advances {{in our understanding of}} the disorder and wide acceptance that it affects phonetic - motoric planning of speech. However, newly developed methods for studying nonspeech motor control are providing new insights, indicating that the motor control impairment of AOS extends beyond speech and is manifest in nonspeech movements of the oral structures. We present the most recent developments in theory and methods to examine and define the nature of AOS. Theories of the disorder are then related to existing treatment approaches and the efficacy of these approaches is examined. Directions for development of new treatments are posited. It is proposed that treatment programmes driven by a principled account of how the motor system learns to produce skilled actions will provide the most efficient and effective framework for treating <b>motorbased</b> speech disorders. In turn, well controlled and theoretically motivated studies of treatment efficacy promise to stimulate further development of theoretical accounts and contribute to our understanding of AOS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Vision is {{basically}} a sensory modality, so {{it is no surprise}} that the investigation into the brain’s visual functions has been focused on its sensory aspect. Thus, questions like (1) how can external geometric properties represented in internal states of the visual system be grounded, (2) how do the visual cortical receptive fields (RFs) form, and (3) how can visual shapes be recognized have all been addressed within the framework of sensory information processing. However, this view is being challenged on multiple fronts, with an increasing emphasis on the motor aspect of visual function. In this paper, we will review works that implicate the important role of motor function in vision, and discuss our latest results touching upon the issues of grounding, RF development, and shape recognition. Our main findings are that (1) motor primitives play a fundamental role in grounding, (2) RF learning can be biased and enhanced by the motor system, and (3) shape recognition is easier with <b>motorbased</b> representations than with sensor-based representations. The insights we gained here will help us better understand visual cortical function. Also, we expect the motor-oriented view of visual cortical function to be generalizable to other sensory cortices such as somatosensory and auditory cortices. I...|$|R
40|$|Human concept {{learning}} is particularly impressive in two respects: the internal structure of concepts can be representationally rich, {{and yet the}} very same concepts can also be learned from just a few examples. Several decades of research have dramatically advanced our understanding of these two aspects of concepts. While the richness and speed of {{concept learning}} are most often studied in isolation, the power of human concepts may be best explained through their synthesis. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of one-shot concept learning, suggesting that rich generative knowledge {{in the form of}} a motor program can be induced from just a single example of a novel concept. Participants were asked to draw novel handwritten characters given a reference form, and we recorded the motor data used for production. Multiple drawers of the same character not only produced visually similar drawings, but they also showed a striking correspondence in their strokes, as measured by their number, shape, order, and direction. This suggests that participants can infer a rich <b>motorbased</b> concept from a single example. We also show that the motor programs induced by individual subjects provide a powerful basis for one-shot classification, yielding far higher accuracy than state-of-the-art pattern recognition methods based on just the visual form...|$|R
