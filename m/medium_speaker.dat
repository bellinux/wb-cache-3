Drawing {{is on the}} move: while still subsidiary, it has become {{established}} as an autonomous art with a primary status. Travelling Lines brings together scholars, artists, curators and collectors to create an international forum to consider three key themes: itinerant modes of drawing by Latin America based artists that prioritise investigation and exploration, as line travels off the page {{and out of the}} studio into the environment; how the nomadic practices of artists necessitate conceptual and low-key strategies associated with drawing, an especially portable medium; and how itinerant and other modes of drawing circulate within the transnational circuits of the globalised art world. Focusing on one <b>medium,</b> <b>speakers</b> address how visual languages participate in, depend on, and travel across local as well as global territories. The conference coincides with the exhibition The Peripatetic School: Itinerant drawing from Latin America, curated by Tanya Barson, Curator, International Art, Tate Modern...|$|R

In particular, banking applications with up to 400 enrolled speakers and short training times are targeted. Two PNN-based open-set text-independent systems for Speaker Identification and Speaker Verification correspondingly are presented.

40|$|For a {{information}} spread <b>medium,</b> a <b>speaker</b> is used {{to convey}} the information to more people at once. While the use of speaker creates {{a lot of noise}} pollution, a dot-matrix display were used all around the world to convey message to the public more efficiently. A dot-matrix led display is a display device the were used to convey information on machines, clocks, railway departure indicators and many other devices. The display consists of a dot matrix of led lights that works by switching on or off selected lights. A common problem is the display is usually placed at high place to make it visible yet this poses a problem to reprogram the display if there is any new message to be written or spoken. The project uses an arduino Uno that communicate with an android phone through a bluetooth module to reprogram a dot-matrix display. Through this, the display can show new message through the voice recognition wireless using an app used by an android mobile phone...|$|R
40|$|Although the high-variability {{training}} method can enhance learning of non-native speech categories, this {{can depend on}} individuals’ aptitude. The current study asked how general the effects of perceptual aptitude are by testing whether they occur with training materials spoken by native speakers and whether they depend {{on the nature of}} the to-be-learned material. Forty-five native Dutch listeners took part in a 5 -day training procedure in which they identified bisyllabic Mandarin pseudowords (e. g., asa) pronounced with different lexical tone combinations. The training materials were presented to different groups of listeners at three levels of variability: low (many repetitions of a limited set of words recorded by a single <b>speaker),</b> <b>medium</b> (fewer repetitions of a more variable set of words recorded by three speakers), and high (similar to medium but with five speakers). Overall, variability did not influence learning performance, but this was due to an interaction with individuals’ perceptual aptitude: increasing variability hindered improvements in performance for low-aptitude perceivers while it helped improvements in performance for high-aptitude perceivers. These results show that the previously observed interaction between individuals’ aptitude and effects of degree of variability extends to natural tokens of Mandarin speech. This interaction was not found, however, in a closely matched study in which native Dutch listeners were trained on the Japanese geminate/singleton consonant contrast. This may indicate that the effectiveness of high-variability training depends not only on individuals’ aptitude in speech perception but also {{on the nature of the}} categories being acquired...|$|R
40|$|Although {{research}} in bilingual studies has widely investigated language alternation in various settings, very few studies probe into bilingual conversation in specific institutional contexts, {{in which the}} power relations of speakers’ institutional roles are relatively discernible. In view of this, this dissertation undertakes the research targeting police-public interactions in police check-up encounters in the An-Nan District of southern Taiwan, in which most speakers are Mandarin-Minnanyu bilinguals. While my previous project (Lee, 2011) indicates a tendency for officers to accommodate people’s language preferences, the present research begins with the hypothesis of “power as medium negotiation,” attempting to analyse the new data of eleven recordings conducted in the same research site. In order to verify the hypothesis, analysed instances are categorised into three parts: (1) speakers’ negotiation toward a monolingual medium (2) speakers’ negotiation toward a bilingual medium (3) transitional places of medium switching. By extensively applying Gafaranga’s (1999, 2000, 2007 a, 2007 b) notion of medium and making appropriate use of Auer’s (1984, 1988, 1995) sequential approach {{to look at the}} local environments of the speech turns for how medium negotiation sequences unfold, it has been found that there are no consistent results to support the hypothesis. By contrast, it is observed that both the officers and the public negotiate for their preferred codes throughout conversations. Furthermore, officers and the public propose their language preferences with different considerations, such as one’s “competence-related preference (Gafaranga, 2001 : 1916),” “the participant-related factor (Gafaranga & Torras, 2002 a: 7),” and “the medium switching proposal as a contextualisation cue for a topic shift” (Torras, 1998; Gumperz, 1982). For this study investigating the inter-relevance between institutional power and medium negotiation, the current results suggest that the institutional parameter of officers’ power does not permeate to the level of bilingual <b>speaker’s</b> <b>medium</b> negotiation; additionally, it is hoped that this study will indicate a researchable facet for further investigation studying bilingual conversations in other institutions...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Psychology: Academic Research: Developmental Psychopathology, 2010 Parents Raising Safe Kids (PRSK) is an empirically research-based, {{national}} violence prevention {{created by}} the American Psychological Association (APA) and the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), {{with the goals of}} reducing violence in families with children ages 0 - 8 and making violence prevention visible within the community. The PRSK curriculum is comprised of four modules: anger management, social problem-solving, positive discipline, and media violence literacy that, through the use of videos, role playing, group discussions, homework, and hands-on activities, serve to teach caregivers non-violent strategies for parenting as well as increase their child development knowledge. The current study is a formative and summative evaluation of the PRSK program. In the span of one calendar year, participants located at nine sites within the United States, including incarcerated caregivers, teen parents, and court mandated caregivers, participated in the free, eight-week violence prevention program. Results of the current study suggest PRSK is an effective parenting program. Participants significantly increased their violence prevention knowledge for all four modules, with small to <b>medium</b> effects. Spanish <b>speakers</b> significantly outperformed English speakers, both in terms of more knowledge gained from the PRSK program and higher retention rates. These results will be used to inform stakeholders at the APA of the program???s effectiveness at reaching its goals, namely reducing violence within the home. Additionally, this study will make recommendations regarding the implementation of the PRSK program, specifically which components are most effective and what elements need improvement. Finally, this study will make recommendations regarding PRSK???s evaluation tools, which until now have yet to be analyzed psychometrically. This current research is also a stride in support PRSK to become an evidence-based practice. The results from this study suggest that PRSK is an affordable, flexible, effective program that can reduce coercive parenting behavior while increasing positive parenting techniques and child development knowledge. More research is needed regarding certain at-risk groups that were acutely explored in this study, specifically incarcerated parents and adolescent caregivers...|$|R
