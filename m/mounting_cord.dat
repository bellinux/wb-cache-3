50|$|The 202 telephone, {{like the}} 102, {{consisted}} of two distinct parts. The desk-top set, containing only the dial and a cradle that secured a handset, which combined the receiver and the transmitter elements in one unit, in the on-hook position. The cradle contained a plunger that operated the hookswitch located underneath the cradle, inside the housing. The second part was a physically separate subscriber set (desk set box), in form of a metal or Bakelite box, which contained the ringer and the electrical components to interface the desk set with the telephone network. The desk set {{was connected to the}} subscriber set with a four-conductor <b>mounting</b> <b>cord.</b> The subscriber set was typically mounted either on the wall in close proximity, or to the rear or underneath a desk.|$|E

The output signals of MEMS sensors, which were <b>mounted</b> on harness <b>cords</b> of a Jacquard machine, {{at the moment of}} warp yarn break and after the break for a broad range of basic weaves were acquired during weaving. The weaves investigated are commonly used in Jacquard weaving to form patterns. The strength of the MEMS output acceleration signals was analyzed in time domain.

A <b>cord</b> <b>mounted</b> on {{the ceiling of the}} operator's cab is pulled to open the valve, supplying varying amounts of air to the horn. Thus, an outstretched hand reaching upward and pumping is a signal to the driver of an air horn equipped vehicle, requesting a toot. In modern trucks the horn is actuated by a button on the steering wheel (just like a normal car horn). Some trucks have both electric and air horn, selectable by a switch on the dashboard. This is to prevent the use of the powerful air horn in populated areas.|$|R
50|$|The Scarff {{ring was}} {{a type of}} machine gun {{mounting}} developed during the First World War by Warrant Officer (Gunner) F. W. Scarff of the Admiralty Air Department for use on two-seater aircraft. The <b>mount</b> incorporated bungee <b>cord</b> suspension in elevation {{to compensate for the}} weight of the gun, and allowed an airgunner in an open cockpit to swivel and elevate his weapon (a Lewis machine gun) quickly, and easily fire in any direction. Later models permitted the fitting of two Lewis guns; while this doubled the firepower available, operation of the paired guns was more cumbersome, and required considerable strength from the gunner, especially at altitude, so that many gunners preferred the original single gun - and this became the postwar standard. In either case, the mounting was simple and rugged, and gave its operator an excellent field of fire. It was widely adapted and copied for other airforces.|$|R
50|$|Although the OSHA {{regulations}} require {{either a}} ground conductor program or a GFCI, these two devices provide protection {{in very different}} ways.A GCFI disconnects a circuit whenever it detects that the electric current is not balanced between the energized conductor and the return neutral conductor.See main article: Residual Current DeviceA basic summary of the <b>cord</b> <b>mounted</b> GCM involves a conductor path from the energized conductor (“hot” or black wire) directly through a low-current LED and through the ground wire. This arrangement allows an easy visible indication of acceptable ground continuity in the ground wiring (which would be indicated by the LED being on). The minimum current draw of the LED can be designed such that an impedance value above regulatory limits will not light the LED. The arrangement of detection and components is not standardized as many manufacturers provide commercially available GCMs. Portable ground continuity testers have similar arrangements but generally provide a much broader range of testing options for electrical circuits.|$|R
40|$|For monumental buildings, {{retrofitting}} following seismic {{events with}} less invasive techniques is of paramount importance. Since walls are typically multi-leaf stone masonry, apart from crack grouting, preventing leaf separation and limiting out-of-plane deformations {{should also be}} considered. This paper presents an experimental investigation {{of the effectiveness of}} various retrofitting measures for this type of masonry under compression and in-plane lateral loading. Nine previously damaged three-leaf stone masonry walls were retrofitted and retested under the same boundary conditions. The aim was to use compatible materials and to minimize aesthetic impact. All cracks were grouted with lime-cement grout and some walls were additionally strengthened with near surface <b>mounted</b> (NSM) glass <b>cords,</b> inserted into horizontal mortar joints in various dispositions. For some walls glass cords were also inserted transversally providing connections between the leaves. Under shear loading, grouting of cracks restored the walls’ initial strength and displacement capacity. NSM glass cords in some dispositions increased the displacement capacity and in some cases, depending on the boundary conditions, also changed the collapse mechanism...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Evidence is <b>mounting</b> that spinal <b>cord</b> atrophy {{significantly}} {{correlates with}} disability {{in patients with}} multiple sclerosis (MS). The purpose of this work was to validate 3 different measures for the measurement of cervical cord atrophy on high-resolution MR imaging in patients with MS and in normal control subjects (NCs). We also wanted to evaluate the relationship between cervical cord atrophy and clinical disability {{in the presence of}} other conventional and nonconventional brain MR imaging metrics by using a unique additive variance regression model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 66 MS patients (age, 41. 2 12. 4 years; disease duration, 11. 8 10. 7 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale, 3. 1 2. 1) and 19 NCs (age, 30. 4 12. 0 years). Disease course was relapsing-remitting (34), secondary-progressive (14), primary-progressive (7), and clinically isolated syndrome (11). The cervical cord absolute volume (CCAV) in cubic millimeters and 2 normalized cervical cord measures were calculated as follows: cervical cord fraction (CCF) CCAV/ thecal sac absolute volume, and cervical cord to intracranial volume (ICV) fraction (CCAV/ICV). Cervical and brain lesion volume measures, brain parenchyma fraction (BPF), and mean diffusivity were also calculated. RESULTS: CCAV (P. 0001) and CCF (P. 007) showed the largest differences between NCs and MS patients and between different disease subtypes. In regression analysis predicting disability, CCAV wa...|$|R
5000|$|Ground {{continuity}} monitors are a {{means to}} provide protection to workers as part of OSHA regulations. [...] This OSHA regulation applies only to construction sites. (e.g. early stages of construction where access to a reliable ground might not exist or where portable generators might be used) The use of ground continuity monitors is one option in these environments. GFCI protected circuits are also one option under the OSHA standard. Specifically, the OSHA regulation specifies “The employer shall use either ground fault circuit interrupters … or an assured equipment grounding conductor program … to protect employees on construction sites.” The OSHA regulation also requires that each ground conductor and/or cordset shall be inspected each day, prior to use and after maintenance. The ground is required to be checked for electrical continuity and this test must be documented. The automatic <b>cord</b> <b>mounted</b> GCMs eliminate the need to test each cord or circuit, since the electrical impedance to ground is measured at the attached cord device and visibility indicated there via an LED. These inspections are required by the OSHA regulation on “receptacles which are {{not a part of}} the permanent wiring of the building”. [...] As discussed earlier, the permanent wiring of a building might not be established during the early stages of a construction site and therefore would necessitate some assurance of ground protection.|$|R
40|$|Traumatic injury of {{the spinal}} cord affects the entire {{organism}} directly and indirectly. Primary injury destroys neurons and severs axons which participate in neural circuits. Secondary injuries and pathologies arise from numerous sources including systemic inflammation, consequential damage of cutaneous, muscular, and visceral tissues, and dysregulation of autonomic, endocrine and sensory- motor functions. Evidence is <b>mounting</b> that spinal <b>cord</b> injury (SCI) affects regions {{of the nervous system}} spatially remote from the injury site, as well as peripheral tissues, and alters some basic characteristics of primary afferent cell biology and physiology (cell number, size/frequency, electrophysiology, other). The degree of afferent input and processing above the lesion is generally intact, while that in the peri-lesion area is highly variable, though pathologies emerge in both regions, including a variety of pain syndromes. Primary afferent input to spinal regions below the injury and the processing of this information becomes even more important in the face of complete or partial loss of descending input because such spared sensory processing can lead to both adaptive and pathological outcomes. This issue hosts review and research articles considering mechanisms of plasticity of primary afferent neurons and sensory processing after SCI, and how such plasticity contributes to sparing and/or recovery of functions, as well as exacerbation of existing and/or emergent pathologies. A critical issue {{for the majority of the}} SCI community is chronic above-, peri-, and below-level neuropathic pain, much of which may arise, at least in part, from plasticity of afferent fibers and nociceptive circuitry. For example, autonomic dysreflexia is common hypertensive syndrome that often develops after SCI that is highly reliant on maladaptive nociceptive sensory input and processing below the lesion. Moreover, the loss of descending input leaves the reflexive components of bladder/bowel/sexual function uncoordinated and susceptible to a variety of effects through afferent fiber plasticity. Finally, proper afferent feedback is vital for the effectiveness of activity-dependent rehabilitative therapies, but aberrant nociceptive input may interfere with these approaches since they are often unchecked due to loss of descending modulation...|$|R
40|$|Anesthetics {{suppress}} {{movement in}} response to noxious stimuli, primarily by their direct action on the spinal <b>cord.</b> <b>Mounting</b> evidence from animal studies suggests that their predominant site of action within the spinal cord is the ventral rather than the dorsal horn. The first {{aim of this study}} was to identify in humans different spinal parameters to compare of anesthetic effects on the spinal cord with the effects on the cerebral cortex. We used the H-reflex and F waves as spinal parameters to examine the effect of anesthetics on the ventral horn of the spinal cord. F waves are almost completely suppressed at subclinical concentrations of sevoflurane and Propofol. Differences in the equilibration half times of H-reflex and F wave in comparison to the EEG effects indicate the presence of different effect compartments for both effects. This is an argument that spinal effects of anesthetics in humans are also independent of their cerebral effects. Reduced excitability of spinal motoneurons can be mediated by both presynaptic and postsynaptic effects of anesthetics,. Our results demonstrate in humansstrong presynaptic effects of propofol intermediate presynaptic effects of the volatile anesthetic sevoflurane but no presynaptic effects of nitrous oxide. A possible explanation for this difference may be the different potency of the respective drugs in enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor-mediated inhibition, because presynaptic inhibition in the spinal cord involves this receptor subtype. Besides their action on the ventral horn anesthetic also reduce spinal excitability by effects on the dorsal horn. To elucidate the relative effects of Propofol and Sevoflurane on the ventral and dorsal horn we employed two reflex circuits including neurons located in different parts of the spinal cord: the proprioceptive H reflex, including only ventral horn neurons, and the RIII reflex as a component of the nociceptive flexion reflex, which includes ventral as well as dorsal horn neurons. Sevoflurane produces a larger inhibitory effect on the H reflex than propofol, which confirms that the ventral horn is a more important target for volatile anesthetics, whereas effects of propofol on this site of action are rather limited. Our findings indirectly suggest for propofol a relatively stronger effect within the dorsal horn...|$|R
40|$|In the thesis, the {{behaviour}} of three-leaf {{stone masonry}} walls under compression loading and in-plane shear loading is studied. An extensive experimental campaign {{was conducted on}} 18 walls, accompanied by tests on masonry constituents (mortar and stone). The type of the tested masonry is typical for older representative buildings, which often present important cultural heritage assets. Influence of morphology, level of pre-compression and boundary conditions on various characteristics of the walls behaviour was systematically studied. Besides the strength, the greatest emphasis was on {{the analysis of the}} displacement capacity and damage of the walls at characteristic stages of their response. Due to various boundary conditions, different failure mechanisms developed; rocking, mixed and diagonal shear. Leaf separation and the out-of-plane mechanism of the wall was not critical as expected. It developed more evidently in the post-peak phase of the tests for specimens with higher pre-compression. The presence of connecting stones had no influence neither on the obtained shear strength nor on the displacement capacity of the walls. The experimental results were compared to results of analytical models for prediction of shear resistance. For the tested type of masonry, shear strength can be adequately estimated with existing models for the failure mechanisms that developed in the tests. Drift capacity of the walls was however significantly higher than drift capacity allowed in the code provisions (EN 1998 - 3 in FEMA 306). In heritage buildings also various artistic assets in the form of painted walls are often present. Lime plaster was applied to the walls in order to study its performance during cyclic shear loading. Reference drift values for walls at 4 different characteristic plaster damage states were determined. They can be used for performance based seismic assessment of historic buildings. The second part of the thesis deals with strengthening of the damaged three-leaf stone masonry walls. For monumental buildings there are usually strict demands upon the use of materials compatible to existing materials, reversibility, etc., therefore a new strengthening system was developed. Walls were retrofitted along the cracks with lime-cement grout, additionally strengthened with near surface <b>mounted</b> (NSM) glass <b>cords</b> and transversally connected; 10 walls were strengthened with various combinations of measures and re-tested. Grouting successfully retrofitted the walls, while NSM glass cords increased the displacement capacity and, in one case, also shear resistance substantially. Finally, the results of tests of the un-strengthened walls (drifts) were adopted for the numerical analysis of the seismic performance of an actual building (mansion Vipolže). Nonlinear static analyses using equivalent frame model were conducted. The influence of the assumed drift limits on the seismic resistance was analysed. The increase of seismic performance with increasing drift limits of walls is evident and it would be reasonable to further study the prospect of increasing the drift limits in the code provisions for types of masonry, which are more ductile (historical masonry) ...|$|R
