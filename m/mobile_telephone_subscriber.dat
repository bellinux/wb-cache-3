Although cross-sectional performance comparisons of models are numerous, varying {{stages of the}} S-shaped diffusion curve have not been analyzed by longitudinal studies. This study determines whether the best model applies to an entire diffusion life span. <b>Mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>subscriber</b> data for Taiwan during 1988 - 2007 are analyzed to compare the performance of three popular diffusion models and one well-known forecasting model [...] the Gompertz, Logistic, Bass, and time-series autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models, respectively.

To identify the appropriate growth model, this study compares the fitness and forecasting ability of three conventional models — the Logistic, Bass, and Gompertz models.

Empirical results, based on data for <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>subscribers</b> in China for 1986 – 2007, indicate that the Gompertz model performs best.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth in Nigeria using time series quarterly data {{for the period of}} 2002 to 2014. A functional relationship was modeled between macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth rate, teledensity, number of <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>subscribers,</b> number of landline subscribers, degree of openness in the economy, gross domestic investment and foreign direct investment. This study adopted an autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) estimation techniques approach to cointegration test using bound test, stability test and others.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{information}} and communication technologies (ICT), especially mobile phone rollout, on economic growth in a sample of African countries from 1988 to 2007. Further, we investigate whether financial inclusion is one of the channels through which mobile phone development influences economic growth. In estimating {{the impact of}} ICT on economic growth, we use a wide range of ICT indicators, including <b>mobile</b> and fixed <b>telephone</b> penetration rates and the cost of local calls. We address any endogeneity issues by using the System Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) estimator. Financial inclusion is captured by variables measuring access to financial services, such as the number of deposits or loans per head, compiled by Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Martinez Peria (2007) and the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP, 2009). The results confirm that ICT, including mobile phone development, contribute significantly to economic growth in African countries. Part of the positive effect of mobile phone penetration on growth comes from greater financial inclusion. At the same time, the development of mobile phones consolidates the impact of financial inclusion on economic growth, especially in countries where mobile financial services take hold.

It turns out that interconnection is pivotal in determining market structure, the viability of competitors and the success of deregulatory programs. Interconnecting the Network of Networks by Professor Eli Noam (2001) provides a remarkable review of the issues surrounding this topic. Interconnection’s importance is clear upon a moment’s reflection. In today’s society, we have <b>mobile</b> <b>telephones</b> talking to <b>subscribers</b> on wireline networks; the same mobile phone can read e-mail messages, and surf the web. Computers, via voice over internet protocol (VoIP), can be used to replace the traditional phone over broadband cable connections. The list goes on… The book is an omnibus approach to the subject. It begins with a brief history of the industrial segment and interconnection’s {{role in the development of}} the telecommunications industry’s structure. From the beginning of the telecommunications industry, starting with the telegraph, interconnection has been important in ensuring the connectivity of networks. In 1865, the predecessor of the International Telecommunication Union was formed to ensure interconnection of telegraph service across national boundaries. The issues related to network access have become more critical in the age of multiple communications technologies – internet, mobile phone, WiFi (80211. b) wireless networks, wide and local area networks (WANs and LANs), satellite systems, cable broadband – all of which are capable o...|$|R
