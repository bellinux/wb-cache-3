25|$|Preparing is {{the process}} used in place of carding for long wools and hairs which would break on the card and {{therefore}} greatly reduce {{the quality of the}} worsted yarn produced. The <b>maker-up</b> or double-screw sheeting preparer is the first machine. This passes the fibre to and from delivery sheets via rollers, and ends with a lap of wool from six to eight feet long. The single screw can preparer is the most important machine of these, as it is here that the laps of wool or hair taken from the preceding boxes are prepared into a continuous sliver. The lap is placed on the feed sheet and carried forward to the back rollers. From the back rollers the fibres are delivered to the fallers, which with the aid of the front rollers, draw out the material into a continuous sliver. From the front rollers the sliver of fibres passes through a funnel, through the calender rollers and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the combing machine.|$|E

5000|$|Evan MacColl {{was born}} at Kenmore {{on the banks of}} Loch Fyne, Argyll and Bute, Scotland, on 21 September 1808 when the area was {{thoroughly}} Gaelic speaking. His father was Dugald MacColl who was possessed of [...] "the richest store of Celtic song of any man living in his part of the country." [...] His mother, Mary Cameron, [...] "was noted for her storehouse of traditional tales, legendary and fairy tales." [...] She was also said to be something of an 'improvisatrice' or <b>maker-up</b> of tales. Though MacColl was fully employed farming and fishing, and later with road repairs, he nevertheless received a fair education. His father was fond of literature and procured books for his children when he could. The local village school offered a very limited education in English, and his father employed a tutor who taught his son English and instilled in him a love of Burns and of English literature in general. His poetic efforts began in boyhood, founded on a rich vein of the native Gaelic literary tradition surrounding him in youth and inherited from his family, although also inflected by the growing influence of Lowland Scots and anglophone literature.|$|E
