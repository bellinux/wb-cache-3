40|$|This thesis {{presents}} ethnographic {{research into}} the practice of off-grid, low-impact dwelling in West Wales. It asks how participants imagine, construct and live lives that are low impact, and explores how this brings them into conflict with local authority planners about {{the proper use of}} land. The thesis extends anthropological theories of dwelling to critique the domestic development agenda. It demonstrates ways that low-impact dwelling is qualitatively different to low-impact development. This important distinction provides an original contribution to the existing body of literature about UK low-impact development, by revealing how inequalities implicit in the notion of development shape the possibilities for alternative models of rural land use. Research was conducted within an ecovillage in West Wales for a period of 15 months between 2010 and 2011. Supplementary visits and short stays were arranged with participants in other sites, both ecovillages and independent autonomous dwellings. This immersive approach built a sound network of low-impact practitioners, who provided semi-structured and unstructured interviews, and opportunities for participant observation. A new planning rationality has consolidated around the idea of sustainable development; policies in favour of low-impact development, but which remain subject to regulation, standards and models to ensure compliance with a <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> <b>requirements,</b> are one of the results. Research participants and the Welsh Assembly Government hold divergent notions of low-impact dwelling in spite of models and mechanisms which would contain them both. Low-impact dwellers reject this system, or “grid”, and in doing so construct a hoped-for future in the present, a form of everyday activism...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} component model, reference architecture and peer-evaluated prototype for Semantic Service Oriented Architecture (SSOA). Semantic Web service technology, {{derived from the}} combination of the Semantic Web and Web services, is the enabling-technology for SSOA. Allowing the semantics of the public data and process model of Web services to be unambiguously communicated to potential service-consumers, provides the basis for Web services to be discovered, composed, and invoked as needed. The alternative is that these actions must be carried out manually in advance. The thesis is motivated by the fact that, although a body of research has developed into many aspects of Semantic Web services, a gap remains between conceptual models and languages for Semantic Web services on the one hand, and prototype implementations using those models and languages, primarily for service discovery, on the other. Filling this gap requires a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches. From a top-down perspective, the absence of a reference software architecture model, as distinct from a conceptual model, for Semantic Web services gives rise to a number of shortcomings in the body of knowledge. These include the identification of a minimal component model for an SSOA, defining corresponding behavioural and component communication models and, validating this architecture, both experimentally and qualitatively {{so that it can be}} regarded as a reference point for further research. Experimental validation is achieved by peer-review, through the application of a prototype implementation of the SSOA to a set of open and independently specified system-integration problems. Qualitative evaluation is carried out by first determining a <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> <b>requirements</b> on which the SSOA is based, and using this as the basis for relating five contemporary Semantic Web service frameworks to the SSOA. The thesis moves on to describe how research challenges arose in the course of building and validating the prototype SSOA implementation. Two specific challenges were in the areas of (1) Semantic Web service discovery where incomplete data, available in the service description, must be augmented by fetching additional data at the time the service is required, and (2) the enactment of process mediation between the public interface descriptions of a service requester and a matching Web service offer. Devising solutions to these problems, applying them to real-world problems and evaluating their outcomes both experimentally and qualitatively represents problem-driven contributions of this thesis from a bottom-up perspective...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new method for the {{computation}} of low rank approximations {{to the solution}} of large, sparse, stable Lyapunov equations.

Besides the efficient solution <b>of</b> the <b>matrix</b> equation itself, a thorough integration of the method into several control algorithms can improve their performance to a high degree. This is demonstrated for algorithms for model reduction and optimal control. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic for determining a set of suboptimal ADI shift parameters.

DOTs of several states have started looking into using UAS technology for different purposes from tracking highway construction projects and performing structure inventories to road maintenance, monitoring roadside environmental conditions, {{as well as many}} other traffic management or safety issues, albeit individually focusing on specific us age scenarios. This study investigates various divisions and offices within a Department of Transportation to determine the operational requirements for UAS usage in specific divisions which have the potential to implement this technology to aid and supplement their daily operations. Through a series of interviews with subject matter experts at the management and operational levels, a <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> user <b>requirements</b> for tasks that have the potential to use UAS is developed.

While study in relay systems is often carried out for individual users independently, in this paper, we present a new design termed as relay-based multi-user cooperative communication specifically for the uplink of 4 G systems. In this system, data streams from multiple users are coded at the relay with simple ”addition ” operations in the finite field. These coded data, instead of original data, will be forwarded by the RS to the base station (BS). A type <b>of</b> coding <b>matrices</b> with <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> full rank and maximum information spreading is employed. With spreading information of one user to multiple data streams, the cooperative communication {{can be carried out}} for multiple users simultaneously, using a turbo decoding process that alternates decoding between a multi-user decoder and a number of single-user decoders.

If the right regular representation <b>of</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> an element in R is an Hadamard matrix, we call this an Hadamard <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> generalized quaternion type. An Hadamard matrix generated by the Paley type 1 matrix is Seidel-equivalent to an Hadamard <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> generalized quaternion type, bound by some conditions. When the order of generalized quaternion group is minimum, i. e. when Qs is the quaternion group, then an Hadamard <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> generalized quaternion type is exactly an Hadamard <b>matrix</b> <b>of</b> type Q.
