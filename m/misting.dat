40|$|<b>MIST</b> 1 {{is a basic}} helix-loop-helix (bHLH) {{transcription}} factor that is expressed in serous secretory cells of multiple organs. In the pancreas, <b>MIST</b> 1 expression is restricted to pancreatic acinar cells. Mouse <b>Mist</b> 1 null (<b>Mist</b> 1 KO) pancreata consist of acinar cells exhibiting dramatic differentiation defects including hyperproliferation, lack of cell polarity, failure to establish cell-cell junctions and compromised secretory function. Despite extensive characterization of <b>Mist</b> 1 KO mice, the molecular properties of the protein and the mechanisms by which it regulates pancreatic acinar cell differentiation are largely unknown. In this thesis, I dissected the <b>MIST</b> 1 protein {{with the aim of}} identifying the position of its functional motifs that are responsible for transcription activation/repression. <b>MIST</b> 1 and <b>MIST</b> 1 bHLH, a <b>MIST</b> 1 truncation that only contains the central bHLH domains of the protein, were expressed in pancreatic acinar cells of <b>Mist</b> 1 KO mice, and the pancreata of the transgenic mice were studied to compare the activities of <b>MIST</b> 1 and <b>MIST</b> 1 bHLH in rescuing the <b>Mist</b> 1 KO phenotype. Both <b>MIST</b> 1 and <b>MIST</b> 1 bHLH completely restored <b>Mist</b> 1 KO pancreatic acinar cells in all aspects of the <b>Mist</b> 1 KO phenotype, including proliferation control, cellular organization and <b>MIST</b> 1 target gene expression. These results support the contention that all functional motifs necessary for the transcriptional activity of <b>MIST</b> 1 reside within the central bHLH region. To reveal the molecular mechanisms behind the function of <b>MIST</b> 1 in acinar cells, <b>Mist</b> 1 KO pancreatic acinar cells were also examined for structural defects involving organization of their actin cytoskeleton. Expression profiling of the RHO family GTPases, a group of key regulators of cellular actin organization, revealed that <b>MIST</b> 1 regulates expression of Rnd 2, a RHO family GTPase 2 gene. Indeed, <b>MIST</b> 1 binds to the Rnd 2 gene promoter and represses Rnd 2 gene expression in pancreatic acinar cells. Interestingly, RND 2 overexpression correlates with acinar cell de-differentiation caused by various genetic or chemical reagents. Additionally, diminished Rnd 2 expression in pancreatic AR 42 J cells results in suppressed cell proliferation and altered cell morphology. Taken together, I propose that <b>MIST</b> 1 controls pancreatic acinar cell differentiation through its regulation of the Rnd 2 gene. In normal acinar cells, <b>MIST</b> 1 maintains low levels of RND 2. Elevation of Rnd 2 expression upon <b>Mist</b> 1 deletion leads to acinar cell de-differentiation, a condition that primes the exocrine pancreas for acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and pancreatic cancer. ...|$|R

This type of system is commonly employed, especially in manufacturing. It is often not a practical option for MRO or hobbyist metalcutting, where smaller, simpler machine tools are used.
