5|$|On March 23, 2007, Maturi <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> that {{surprised}} many when he hired Tubby Smith after he {{resigned from the}} University of Kentucky {{to be the next}} head Gopher basketball coach. Smith's name recognition and winning reputation gave the program a new optimism, something it badly needed to counter its dwindling fan interest.|$|E
5|$|Their {{training}} schedule {{consisted of}} individual training {{two or three}} times a week and two days a week of coordinated tandem training during the Olympic year. Marchant's main tactical responsibility was to look to the outside for impending attacks while Browne patrolled the inside. Marchant devised a signal system, such as a head bump on Browne's hip, or even a verbal shout when the opposition <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move.</b>|$|E
5|$|Washington at {{this time}} moved his {{headquarters}} from Middlebrook in New Jersey up to New Windsor on the Hudson, with an army of 10,000. The British, led by Clinton, <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> up the Hudson against American posts at Verplanck's Point and Stony Point, and both places succumbed; but a counter-offensive was briefly successful by the patriots led by General Anthony Wayne. Clinton was able to shut off Kings Ferry in the end, {{but it was a}} strategic loss; he could proceed no farther up the river due to American fortifications and Washington's army. The skirmishes at Verplanck's Point and at Stony Point demonstrated that the continental infantry had become quite formidable and were an enormous boost to morale.|$|E

5|$|A {{week after}} the Gent–Wevelgem, Cancellara raced the Tour of Flanders. On the {{penultimate}} climb of the day, the Oude Kwaremont, Cancellara attacked and only Sep Vanmarcke was able to mark his move. The pair traveled along the course and caught the leaders {{on the road and}} the group of four then rode into the finish together. Cancellara out-sprinted the three other riders to win his third edition of the Tour of Flanders. Three days later, Cancellara raced in the Scheldeprijs. Four days following the Scheldeprijs, Cancellara began the Paris-Roubaix. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> in the Carrefour de l'Arbre sector and which {{led to the formation of}} a lead group. The group came to the line twenty seconds after the winner, with Cancellara managing to sprint to a third-place finish.|$|E
5|$|The 2003–04 season {{comprised}} {{mixed results}} for Alonso and his San Sebastián club. Alonso revelled in {{the opportunity to}} perform in Europe, appearing in all the team's games, and Real Sociedad qualified for the knockout phase of the Champions League. The team struggled {{under the pressure of}} the extra matches, however, and were promptly knocked out of the tournament by Lyon and finished 15th in La Liga. The combination of Alonso's outstanding performances and the team's poor league finish <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> away from Anoeta Stadium inevitable. Despite interest from La Liga champions Real Madrid, Alonso remained committed to Real Sociedad. Madrid failed to meet the £13million price tag that José Luis Astiazarán, the Real Sociedad president, had placed on Alonso and the deal reached a stalemate. Alonso had other concerns and focused on international duty with Spain at UEFA Euro 2004. Despite the fact that Alonso's appearance at the tournament was brief, he caught the attention of retired footballer Jan Mølby, who was impressed with his precise passing abilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} game {{incorporating}} graphics that updated in real time, rather than {{only when the}} player <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move,</b> was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for {{a demonstration of the}} University of Michigan-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954. The game, developed over six months by the pair, featured a pool stick controlled by a joystick and a knob, and a full rack of 15 balls on a table seen in an overhead view. The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion. Like previous video games, the pool game was intended primarily to showcase the computing power of the MIDSAC computer.|$|E

5|$|On lap 48, Mercedes changed strategies, {{bringing}} in both drivers for another tyre stop, {{much to the}} dismay of Lewis Hamilton, who complained to his team over the radio. Meanwhile, a fight developed between Massa and Ricciardo for fifth place, with the latter making the pass at the beginning of lap 53. On the same lap, Sebastian Vettel spun once more at turn seven, this time hitting the barriers, ending his race and bringing out the safety car. The double retirement marked {{the first time since the}} 2006 Australian Grand Prix that none of their cars were classified. During the caution period, the order stood as: Rosberg, Hamilton, Kvyat, Bottas, Ricciardo, Massa, Hülkenberg, Pérez, Verstappen and Grosjean. At the restart at the beginning of lap 58, Bottas <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> on Kvyat into turn one, taking third place. Over the last laps of the race, Hamilton was able to close on Rosberg, as was Massa on the two Red Bull drivers ahead of him. However, neither were able to overtake, and Rosberg crossed the finish line to take victory, followed by Hamilton and Bottas.|$|E
25|$|In 1973 the American League, {{which had}} been {{suffering}} from much lower attendance than the National League, <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> to increase scoring even further by initiating the designated hitter rule.|$|E
25|$|Ronaldinho <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> to Atlético Mineiro on 4 June 2012 in {{a six-month}} contract, {{just four days}} after leaving Flamengo. He wore number 49 in {{reference}} to his mother's birth year since his preferred number 10 was already assigned to Guilherme in the 2012 season.|$|E
5000|$|On 29 August 2007, he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> {{surprise}} <b>move</b> {{to local}} rivals Burnley almost nine {{years after they}} had originally tried to sign him. The reasons cited for his departure were that Preston would not extend his contract by another year, so when offered a two-year contract by Burnley the player accepted and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> £200,000 <b>move</b> to Turf Moor. Preston Chairman Derek Shaw {{did not want to}} lose the player and said; ...|$|R

25|$|In late 1991, McDonnell Douglas <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> to {{separate}} its civil and military divisions {{in a bid}} to raise the estimated $4 billion development costs needed to develop the MD-12X trijet. Separating the costly military C-17 airlifter development, which had been a drain on the company's resources, from the profit-making production of the MD-80 and MD-11 airliners would make it easier to attract foreign investors for the MD-12X.|$|E
25|$|April and May saw the May Days, infighting among Republican {{groups in}} Catalonia. The dispute was between an {{ultimately}} victorious government–Communist {{forces and the}} anarchist CNT. The disturbance pleased Nationalist command, but little was done to exploit Republican divisions. After the fall of Guernica, the Republican government began to fight back with increasing effectiveness. In July, it <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> to recapture Segovia, forcing Franco to delay his advance on the Bilbao front, but for only two weeks. A similar Republican attack, the Huesca Offensive, failed similarly.|$|E
25|$|With {{the club}} {{falling into the}} relegation zone {{and a number of}} players ruled out through injury and suspension, Middlesbrough {{eventually}} moved into the transfer market on 22 January, with their first move bringing in striker Marlon King on loan from Wigan Athletic {{until the end of the}} season. King had been on loan at Hull City but his time there was cut short after he fell out with their manager. A day later, Mido <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> in the opposite direction, also on a loan until the end of the season.|$|E

25|$|Carr's natural father, Lucien Carr, was a writer, {{who in the}} 1940s was at {{the center}} of a group of as-yet unknown writers (Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs). In the summer of 1944, he killed his former scoutmaster, a man who was enamoured with him. One night, the scoutmaster {{supposedly}} <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> on Carr, and Carr stabbed him in the chest with his Boy Scout knife. Carr disposed of the body in the Hudson River, and together he and Kerouac got rid of the knife. Carr was sentenced to two years' jail time and Kerouac a few days.|$|E
25|$|Each {{country in}} the second wave have {{different}} social factors causing increased spread. HIV has not yet <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> into the general populations of some countries, such as Russia. The single social factor (80–90% of new cases) for Russian spread is IVDA, coming from prostitutes and prison inmates—many of whom are IVDAs—are contributing {{to the spread of}} the disease. Drug use is so widespread that many users are integrated into society with jobs and families, suggesting the disease is moving into the mainstream. An estimated 20–25% of IVDA in prison, where there is easy access to drugs, are seropositive.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, led by Shogen Okabayashi (Okabayashi Shogen, born 1949), who {{was sent}} by the elderly Hisa to train under the headmaster, the Takumakai <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> to {{implement}} the forms for teaching the fundamentals of the art as originally established by Tokimune Takeda. This move upset some preservers of Hisa's original teaching method, leading {{to the formation of}} a new organization called the Daibukan, founded by a long term student of Hisa, Kenkichi Ohgami (Ōgami Kenkichi, born 1936). Later, in order to implement greater changes to the curriculum, Okabayashi himself chose to separate from the Takumakai and formed the Hakuho-ryu.|$|E

Upon returning to his home country, the newly independent Croatia, he spent the period between 1996 and 2003 at NK Marsonia before spending a season at the city minnows NK Željezničar. The next season, he returned to Marsonia and in the summer of 2005 he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> to NK Zagreb. He thrived under the tuition of Miroslav Blažević and earned much interest from other clubs, such as Chelsea and Manchester United.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Figo looked {{poised to}} join {{one of the}} big clubs of Europe, but a dispute between Italian clubs Juventus and Parma, with Figo having signed {{contracts}} with both clubs, resulted in an Italian two-year transfer ban on him. Eventually, Figo <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> to Spanish giants Barcelona for a £2.25million fee, being loaned back {{for the remainder of the}} season due to a rule prohibiting Portuguese players from signing for foreign clubs outside a fixed period. This rule had prevented Figo from joining English club Manchester City, where he had been recommended by his former Sporting manager Malcolm Allison for a fee of around £1.2 million.|$|E
25|$|Earnhardt Jr. {{kicked off}} 2015 with a ninth-place {{finish in the}} Sprint Unlimited. On February 19, he won Budweiser Duel No. 1 in what was his fourth triumph in the Budweiser Duels. In the Daytona 500, he led for over 30 laps but {{on one of the}} last restarts, he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> that mired him in the middle without help, and fell back to 16th with 15 laps to go, but managed to make his way back to third place by the last lap.
