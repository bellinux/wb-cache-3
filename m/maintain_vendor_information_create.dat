Outposts can be taken over by Clans or individuals and run as they see fit. The ruler of the outpost sets policies, <b>maintains</b> <b>vendors</b> and services, and is responsible for its defense.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the product, <b>vendor,</b> and <b>information</b> source {{saleability}} judgments of retail store buyers. The sample chosen for the study was retail buyers of women’s wear and men’s wear from three retailers in the southwestern United States. A mailed questionnaire consisting of saleability judgments was sent to 81 retail buyers resulting in a 77 % (n = 63) return rate. Three Principal Component Factor Analyses with Varimax Rotation were used to reduce the number of product, <b>vendor,</b> and <b>information</b> source items to eight factors. Analysis of Variance was used to determine if women’s wear buyers and men’s wear buyers differed significantly on the eight product, <b>vendor,</b> and <b>information</b> source factors. Women’s wear buyers rated reputation, price/promotion, and competition significantly higher than did men’s wear buyers, indicating that women’s wear and men’s wear buyers emphasize different saleability judgments in making purchase decisions. Results will benefit retail management in developing buyer training programs, apparel manufacturers in designing and promoting apparel lines, and educators in designing retail curricula. Today’s competitive retail environment is challenging stores to gain and maintain market share. The function of the retail buyer is to select and buy saleable merchandise...|$|R
