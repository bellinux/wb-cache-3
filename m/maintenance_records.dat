5|$|In 2001, Lieutenant Colonel Odin Lieberman, {{commander}} of the V-22 squadron at Marine Corps Air Station New River, was relieved of duty after allegations that he instructed his unit to falsify <b>maintenance</b> <b>records</b> to make the aircraft appear more reliable.

5|$|The Peruvian {{government}} {{investigated the}} accident, {{and in its}} final report concluded that the probable cause of the accident was the improper execution of engine-out procedures by the flight crew, with contributing factors of improper loading of the aircraft and improper maintenance procedures by company personnel. There was also evidence of a coverup and falsification of critical <b>maintenance</b> <b>records</b> by LANSA employees during the investigation process. The Peruvian government subsequently fined LANSA {{and some of its}} employees, and suspended the airline's operating license for 90 days as a consequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 registered N110AA. It {{had been}} delivered on February 25, 1972, {{and at the}} time of the crash, it had logged just under 20,000 hours of flying time over seven years. The jet was powered by three General Electric CF6-6D engines. A review of the aircraft's flight logs and <b>maintenance</b> <b>records</b> showed that no mechanical discrepancies were noted for May 11, 1979. On the day of the accident, in violation of standard procedure, the records were not removed from the aircraft, and were destroyed in the accident.|$|E

25|$|In an {{accident}} flight, the {{cockpit voice recorder}} (CVR) can usually record its final minutes. In the Partnair crash, however, it had recorded {{the start of the}} flight and stopped shortly before the aircraft took off. From the <b>maintenance</b> <b>records</b> investigators found that, 10 years prior to the accident flight, the cockpit voice recorder's power supply had been re-wired to connect to the aircraft's generator instead of the aircraft's battery if full power was applied for takeoff. As the generator was inoperative on this flight, power to the CVR shut off as the aircraft took off.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{aircraft}} {{was equipped with}} a ground proximity warning system (GPWS) which alerts the pilots if {{the aircraft}} is in immediate danger of flying into the ground or an obstacle, the investigators determined {{that it had been}} malfunctioning during at least 85 of the last 234 flights of the aircraft. The unit was previously fitted in Atlasjet's other MD-83 aircraft (registered TC-AKN) but it had been switched a week prior to the accident. Although the malfunction of the GPWS unit was known to the airline and the DGCA, it was not properly logged in the <b>maintenance</b> <b>records</b> in order to go undetected.|$|E
25|$|The ground-maintenance crew {{locked out}} the thrust {{reverser}} for engine #3 (treated as a {{minimum equipment list}} item) because of technical problems with the thrust reverser sensors during the landing of TWA 881 at JFK, prior to Flight 800's departure. Additionally, severed cables for the engine #3 thrust reverser were replaced. During refueling of the aircraft, the volumetric shutoff (VSO) control was {{believed to have been}} triggered before the tanks were full. To continue the pressure fueling, a TWA mechanic overrode the automatic VSO by pulling the volumetric fuse and an overflow circuit breaker. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>records</b> indicate that the airplane had numerous VSO-related maintenance writeups in the weeks before the accident.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{efforts to}} step up {{maintenance}} efforts, on 8 October 2017, a poorly maintained float and pump system at Bishan Station caused a tunnel flood from a torrential rainstorm. It was the worst train disruption since 2011 and the first ever flooding incident in MRT history that lasted almost a day, disrupting services underground. This also resulted in further loss of public confidence and a huge debate among netizens and Singaporeans about the “high rankings” that manage the system, with calls being made for the resignation of Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan. Urban transport expert Dr Park Byung Joon {{has said that the}} negligence displayed by SMRT in this regard is tantamount to a criminal offence, after an internal investigation found that the maintenance crew of the Bishan Station's pump system had submitted <b>maintenance</b> <b>records</b> for nearly a year without actually carrying out the works.|$|E
500|$|Malaysia {{set up a}} Joint Investigation Team (JIT), {{consisting}} of specialists from Malaysia, Australia, China, the UK, the US, and France, led according to ICAO standards by [...] "an independent investigator in charge". The team consists of an airworthiness group, an operations group, and a medical and human factors group. The airworthiness group will examine issues related to <b>maintenance</b> <b>records,</b> structures, and systems of the aircraft. The operations group will review flight recorders, operations, and meteorology. The medical and human factors group will investigate psychological, pathological, and survival factors. Malaysia also announced, on 6 April, that it had set up three ministerial committees—a Next of Kin Committee, a committee to organise {{the formation of the}} Joint Investigation Team, and a committee responsible for Malaysian assets deployed in the search effort. The criminal investigation is being led by the Royal Malaysia Police, assisted by Interpol and other relevant international law enforcement authorities.|$|E
500|$|In November 1956, the Air Force {{used the}} base for publicity. On 10 November, the Soviet Union {{threatened}} to oust British and French troops from the Middle East, days {{after the end of}} the Suez Crisis. After a response by president Dwight D. Eisenhower to the United Nations, a reporter with the Associated Press visited Castle Air Force Base in California after SAC was alerted to support whatever action the U.S. might take. The reporter was unable to find out classified information, and instead invented <b>maintenance</b> <b>records</b> of the fleet that painted a dismal picture. On 24 and 25 November, four B-52's of the 93rd Bombardment Wing and the 42nd flew nonstop around the perimeter of North America in Operation Quick Kick, which covered [...] in 31 hours, 30 minutes. SAC noted the flight time could have been reduced by 5 to 6 hours if the four inflight refuelings had been done by fast jet-powered tanker aircraft rather than propeller-driven KC-97 Stratofreighters. After the flight ended, the planes landed at Friendship International Airport. The operation distracted public attention from the reporter's story.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Maintenance</b> <b>records</b> {{revealed}} that the 65–76 [...] "Kit" [...] practice torpedo carried by Kursk came from a batch of ten manufactured in 1990, six of which were rejected due to faulty welding. An investigation {{revealed that}} because the torpedoes were not intended to carry warheads, the welds had not been inspected as carefully as welds on torpedoes carrying warheads. When salvage crews finally recovered {{the remains of the}} torpedo and the launch tube, analysis determined that both bore signs of distortion and heat damage that were consistent with an explosion near the middle of the torpedo, very close to an essential welded joint. The official conclusion of the commission was that a faulty weld had led to the explosion.|$|E

[...] Moreover, a large body of research was done by the investigators after the accident, regarding the maintenance operating plan used for EI-AOM and defects on the aircraft found during analysis of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>records.</b> [...] This research was not referred to in the 1970 report. A new board of investigation was set up by the Irish Government and found that the crash was the consequence of a chain of events starting with a failure to the left tail-plane caused by metal fatigue, corrosion, flutter or a bird strike, with the most likely cause being a flutter-induced fatigue failure of the elevator trim tab operating mechanism.|$|E
