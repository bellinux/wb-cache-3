Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Two proton beams each accelerated to 2 OTevl collide with each other in the interaction region producing large number of subatomic particles. The tracks of these particles can be detected by scintillating optic fiber setup. When these particles cut across the scintillating fibers, they are excited. The light output of these fibers is converted into voltage pulses using photodetectors. The output of the photodetectors are used for track detection and identification. The collision takes place every 132 ns. A new integrated circuit packaging structure coupled with a purely hardware system was needed to meet the high speed and best performance requirements for track detection of subatomic particles. Microprocessors cannot be used for this kind of problem, because a processor typically has to execute several instructions before it can do a particular task i. e a sequential operation. Even if a highly parallel approach is used with processors we have the problem of magnanimity. Due to the high 1 / 0 requirement and low complexity of computation involved in track detection, a processor is not the right choice. Hence a purely and highly parallel hardware approach is investigated. The structure developed eliminates one level of packaging and allows upto nine 'Trillion electron volts MCM' modules to be plugged into a large <b>multilayer</b> <b>printed-circuit</b> <b>board</b> using a zero-insertion-force connector system. The 1800 pins on the module, i. e 16200 pins per board and 32 such boards, will be the complete system. The delays, which are the niain performance issue, are given utmost care by eliminating all the unwanted capacitances and inductances. This research details the design and outlines the packaging for the track detection system. This approach {{can be used as a}} model for any other high speed applications which involves low computational complexity but high 1 / 0 requirements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Power {{and ground}} planes are {{required}} to have low impedance {{over a wide range}} of frequencies. Parallel ground and power planes in <b>multilayer</b> <b>printed-circuit</b> <b>boards</b> exhibit multiple resonances, which increase the impedance. Dissipative loading of the radial transmission line structure of the planes reduces the resonance peaks. The dissipative loads can be realized by resistors distributed on the surface or the edges of plain pairs and lossy di-electric material can be applied for distributed loading, and the characterization of the impedance by simulation is very important during the design phase. Measurement results are compared with analytical solutions and simulation results. Furthermore, in this paper, a new algorithm is given for the more efficient calculation of the impedance of power distribution structures.

40|$|LARC(TradeMark) -SI, Langley Research Center- Soluble Imide, was {{developed}} in 1992, with the first patent issuing in 1997, and then subsequent patents issued in 1998 and 2000. Currently, this polymer has been successfully licensed by NASA, and has generated revenues, {{at the time of}} this reporting, in excess of $ 1. 4 million. The success of this particular polymer has been due to many factors and many lessons learned to the point that the invention, while important, is the least significant part in the commercialization of this material. Commercial LARC(TradeMark) -SI is a polyimide composed of two molar equivalents of dianhydrides: 4, 4 -oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA), and 3, 3, 4, 4 -biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride (BPDA) and 3, 4 -oxydianiline (3, 4 -ODA) as the diamine. The unique feature of this aromatic polyimide is that it remains soluble after solution imidization in high-boiling, polar aprotic solvents, even at solids contents of 50 -percent by weight. However, once isolated and heated above its T(sub g) of 240 C, it becomes insoluble and exhibits high-temperature thermoplastic melt-flow behavior. With these unique structure property characteristics, it was thought this would be an advantage to have an aromatic polyimide that is both solution and melt processable in the imide form. This could potentially lead to lower cost production as it was not as equipment- or labor-intensive as other high-performance polyimide materials that either precipitate or are intractable. This unique combination of properties allowed patents with broad claim coverage and potential commercialization. After the U. S. Patent applications were filed, a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract was awarded to Imtec, Inc. to develop and supply the polyimide to NASA and the general public. Some examples of demonstration parts made with LARC(TradeMark) -SI ranged from aircraft wire and <b>multilayer</b> <b>printed-circuit</b> <b>boards,</b> to gears, composite panels, supported adhesive tape, composite coatings, cookware, and polyimide foam. Even with its unique processing characteristics, the thermal and mechanical properties were not drastically different from other solution or meltprocessable polyimides developed by NASA. LARC(TradeMark) -SI risked becoming another interesting, but costly, high-performance material...|$|R

As some designers have found, the multiple layers need {{not be the same}} dielectric materials: a growing number of RF/ microwave circuit designs are being implemented with hybrid multilayer PCBs, in which different materials are used among the layers. This allows the choice of materials to be tailored to the various functions on the different layers of the PCB. Of course, there are some areas of concern when adopting such a design approach, and this article will provide a simple overview of these hybrid multilayer PCBs in terms of fabrication, electrical performance, and the types of circuit materials that are suitable for hybrid multilayer PCBs. One circuit material that is used quite often in high-frequency hybrid multilayer PCBs is FR- 4, although {{it may not be the}} most ideal choice for some circuits. Low-cost FR- 4 circuit materials have been in use for a wide range of circuits for decades. FR- 4 is glass-reinforced epoxy laminate material. Its performance is predictable and reliable, and it can be processed with basic fabrication methods. However, FR- 4 exhibits a very high dissipation factor, which translates into high dielectric losses for circuits at microwave frequencies. Because of its loss characteristics, FR- 4 is typically not used for pure RF/microwave circuits, but has been used in some high-frequency hybrid multilayer PCBs for various reasons. FR- 4 is available in standard grade and with high glass transition temperature (Tg), which is the temperature at which the modulus of the material will change dramatically. Such temperature changes can impact the reliability of plated through holes (PTHs) through the laminate, as used to interconnect different circuit layers in a multilayer PCB. Some high-Tg FR- 4 materials provide good stability with the processing temperatures required for many circuit fabrication tech...|$|R
40|$|A device denoted a board saver {{has been}} {{developed}} {{as a means of}} reducing wear and tear of a <b>printed-circuit</b> <b>board</b> onto which an antifuse field programmable gate array (FPGA) is to be eventually soldered permanently after a number of design iterations. The need for the board saver or a similar device arises because (1) antifuse-FPGA design iterations are common and (2) repeated soldering and unsoldering of FPGAs on the <b>printed-circuit</b> <b>board</b> to accommodate design iterations can wear out the <b>printed-circuit</b> <b>board.</b> The board saver is basically a solderable/unsolderable FPGA receptacle that is installed temporarily on the <b>printed-circuit</b> <b>board.</b> The board saver is, more specifically, a smaller, square-ring-shaped, <b>printed-circuit</b> <b>board</b> (see figure) that contains half via holes one for each contact pad along its periphery. As initially fabricated, the board saver is a wider ring containing full via holes, but then it is milled along its outer edges, cutting the via holes in half and laterally exposing their interiors. The board saver is positioned in registration with the designated FPGA footprint and each via hole is soldered to the outer portion of the corresponding FPGA contact pad on the first-mentioned <b>printed-circuit</b> <b>board.</b> The via-hole/contact joints can be inspected visually and can be easily unsoldered later. The square hole {{in the middle of the}} board saver is sized to accommodate the FPGA, and the thickness of the board saver is the same as that of the FPGA. Hence, when a non-final FPGA is placed in the square hole, the combination of the non-final FPGA and the board saver occupy no more area and thickness than would a final FPGA soldered directly into its designated position on the first-mentioned circuit board. The contact leads of a non-final FPGA are not bent and are soldered, at the top of the board saver, to the corresponding via holes. A non-final FPGA can readily be unsoldered from the board saver and replaced by another one. Once the final FPGA design has been determined, the board saver can be unsoldered from the contact pads on the first-mentioned <b>printed-circuit</b> <b>board</b> and replaced by the final FPGA...|$|R
