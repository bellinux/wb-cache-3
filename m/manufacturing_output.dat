Unemployment during the Depression was high in most urban areas, and St. Louis was no exception (see table). Black workers in St. Louis, as in many cities, suffered significantly higher unemployment than their white counterparts. To aid the unemployed, the city allocated funds starting in 1930 toward relief operations. In addition to city relief aid, New Deal programs such as the Public Works Administration employed thousands of St. Louisans. Civic improvement construction jobs also reduced the number of persons on direct relief aid by the late 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to nationalise AESC and develop Leigh Creek {{proved to be}} prescient. In early 1947, mines in New South Wales were again crippled by strikes. The worst strike came in 1949, forcing Chifley to send {{in the armed forces}} to extract coal. While the other states had to suffer industrial power rationing and thus reduced <b>manufacturing</b> <b>output</b> and more unemployment, South Australia managed to escape as the miners at Leigh Creek worked around the clock. Within four years the mine was operating at a surplus and the town was further rewarded with federal funding. From 1947 until the end of Playford's leadership in 1965, the output of the mine increased tenfold to almost two million tons a year. Transport infrastructure was improved, European immigrant workers were recruited, and twin power plants at Port Augusta were completed in 1960 and named after the premier. The new plants exclusively used Leigh Creek coal and by 1970, the whole state was self-sufficient for electricity. ETSA and the mine were generating enough revenue to maintain the town—sometimes dubbed Uncle Tom's Baby—and mine of Leigh Creek and making a profit as well. From 1946 to 1965, the proportion of South Australians connected to electricity increased from 70 to 96%.|$|E

The study has been performed at industries of different sizes and type to classify the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>outputs.</b> The result of the study shows that flexibility and innovativeness are strengths, while cost and delivery are weaknesses since they depend on the lack of skilled personnel, lack of performance measurements and time. Quality is ranked {{as one of the most}} important priorities in the literature, but the study identified quality as neither a strength nor a weakness. Many of the companies in the study do not have control of, nor do they measure the competitive priories, which affect the companies negatively. To remain competitive the small companies must know which <b>manufacturing</b> <b>outputs</b> are the order winners and control the order winning competitive priorities. The competitive priorities must be analysed further to understand which the suitable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>outputs</b> are for small companies today...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effects of}} local {{government}} expenditures on the <b>manufacturing</b> sector <b>output</b> is studied using the public infrastructure model developed by Holtz-Eakin and Lovely (1996). Data from thirteen local governments in Korea for the period 1985 - 2000 is used to estimate the industry-level returns {{to a variety of}} equations as well as the firm-level returns to scale equation. Strong empirical evidence shows that local government expenditures increase both the number of establishments and the output per firm in the manufacturing sector. Local government expenditures are seen to help increase the output of firms in the manufacturing industry through both industry-level returns to variety effect and firm-level returns to scale effect. The elasticity of the total <b>manufacturing</b> sector <b>output</b> with respect to local government expenditures is calculated at 0. 620 and found to be statistically significant. Our empirical findings are very different from earlier empirical studies for most developed countries including the U. S.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} exchange rate volatility on the manufacturing sector of Nigeria. The flow and stock market theories of exchange rate determination was adopted considering macroeconomic determinants such as balance of trade, trade openness, and net international investment. Furthermore, the influence of changes in parallel exchange rate, official exchange rate and {{real effective exchange rate}} was modeled on the <b>manufacturing</b> sector <b>output.</b> Vector autoregression techniques and vector error correction mechanism were adopted to explore the macroeconomic determinants of exchange rate fluctuation in Nigeria and to examine the influence of exchange rate volatility on the <b>manufacturing</b> sector <b>output</b> in Nigeria. The exchange rate showed an unstable and volatile movement in Nigeria. Official exchange rate significantly impacted on the manufacturing sector of Nigeria and shock to previous <b>manufacturing</b> sector <b>output</b> caused 60. 76 % of the fluctuation in the <b>manufacturing</b> sector <b>output</b> in Nigeria. Trade balance, trade openness and net international investments did not significantly determine exchange rate in Nigeria. However, own shock accounted for about 95 % of the variation of exchange rate fluctuation in the short-run and long-run. Among other macroeconomic variables, net international investment accounted for about 2. 85 % variation of the real effective exchange rate fluctuation in the short-run and in the long-run. Monetary authorities should maintain stability of the exchange rates through proper management so as to encourage local production and government should formulate and implement policies that will develop other sectors of the economy as this will widen the country’s revenue base, reduce our over reliance on oil sector for our foreign exchange earnings and in turn reduce the shocks on our domestic economy...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturing {{strategy}} {{is a plan}} for moving a company from where it is to where it wants to be. Determining the best manufacturing {{strategy is}} not easy because of {{the wide range of}} choices and constraints a company faces. Manufacturing strategy frameworks or models are helpful because they identify the objects that comprise manufacturing strategy and organize these objects into a structure that enables a company to understand and use the objects to develop strategy. Many frameworks are possible and there is no single framework that is best for all companies. In this paper, we are interested in the levels of cost, quality, delivery, and flexibility that manufacturing provides for each product family it produces. This is determined primarily by a company's factories-within-a-factory (FWFs) and so the level of analysis in this paper is the FWF. We identify and examine five manufacturing strategy objects (production systems, <b>manufacturing</b> <b>outputs,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> levers, manufacturing capability, competitive analysis), linkages between these objects, and the manufacturing strategy framework for an FWF that follows from these objects and linkages. We apply the framework to the FWFs of two multi-national companies. This paper is descriptive and exploratory. Strategy objects, linkages, and framework are presented and their use is illustrated. The work of rigorous empirical analysis is left for future research. ...|$|R

The dimensional accuracy of the resulting x/y shrinkage of LTCC substrates is responsible for component assembly problems with the tolerance effect that increases in relation to the substrate size.
