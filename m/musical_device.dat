Banton used an oscillator as a <b>musical</b> <b>device</b> to complement that track's lyrical theme. By contrast, [...] "House with No Door" [...] was mostly put down live. The group found the sessions enjoyable despite some of the downbeat themes present on the album, and all found fun in some of the esoteric sounds they were creating.|$|E
40|$|While several {{researchers}} have grappled {{with the problem}} of comparing <b>musical</b> <b>devices</b> across performance, installation, and related contexts, no methodology yet exists for producing holistic, informative visualizations for these devices. Drawing on existing research in performance interaction, human-computer interaction, and design space analysis, the authors propose a dimension space representation that can be adapted for visually displaying <b>musical</b> <b>devices.</b> This paper illustrates one possible application of the dimension space to existing performance and interaction systems, revealing its usefulness both in exposing patterns across existing <b>musical</b> <b>devices</b> and aiding in the design of new ones...|$|R

500|$|The song's melody oscillates {{over the}} chords of C major and C diminished, a chord favoured by Harrison in his Indian music-inspired {{compositions}} for the Beatles. Acknowledging Harrison's {{statement that the}} tune is [...] "slightly Indian", Everett considers [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] {{to be related to}} the ragas Kosalam and Multani. According to author Simon Leng, however, Harrison based the song partly on Raga Marwa. Following the inclusion of a raga-style introduction (or alap) in his previous Indian compositions, [...] "Love You To" [...] and [...] "Within You Without You", [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] begins with a preview of the song's melody played softly, in free time, over the opening drone. Author Ian Inglis credits the song's incorporation of ambient drone, specifically its role in providing [...] "an anchorage point for vocal and instrumental improvisation", as one of the first examples of a <b>musical</b> <b>device</b> that soon became prevalent in the work of Fairport Convention, the Incredible String Band and other folk artists.|$|E
500|$|A {{key feature}} of the song {{is the use of}} stop time, or pauses in the music, {{during the first half of}} the progression. [...] This <b>musical</b> <b>device</b> is {{commonly}} heard in New Orleans jazz, when the instrumentation briefly stops, allowing for a short instrumental solo before resuming. However, Waters' and Dixon's use of stop time serves to heighten the tension through repetition, followed by a vocal rather than an instrument fill. [...] The accompanying riff, which Dixon described as a five-note figure, is similar to that of [...] "Mad Love". [...] He attributed it to the band and using such a phrase for eight bars was a new approach. [...] Although Palmer comments that the entire group phrases the riff in unison, Boone describes it as a [...] "heavy, unhurried counterpoint by all the instruments together". [...] Campbell identifies the opening as actually having [...] "two competing riffs" [...] or contrapuntal motion, with one played by Little Walter on an amplified harmonica and another by Waters on electric guitar.|$|E
500|$|In its operatic context the lament {{takes the}} form of an {{extended}} recitative of more than 70 vocal lines, delivered in five sections divided by choral comments. Some of the wording is prefigured in the immediately preceding scene in which the First Envoy describes Arianna's plight to a sympathetic chorus of fishermen. The lament depicts Arianna's various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of futility. Cusick draws attention to the manner in which Monteverdi is able to match in music the [...] "rhetorical and syntactical gestures" [...] in Rinuccini's text. The opening repeated words [...] "Lasciatemi morire" [...] (Let me die) are accompanied by a dominant seventh chord which Ringer describes as [...] "an unforgettable chromatic stab of pain"; Monteverdi {{was one of the first}} users of this <b>musical</b> <b>device.</b> What follows, says Ringer, has a range and depth [...] "comparable to Shakespeare's most searching soliloquies". The words [...] "Lasciatemi morire" [...] are followed by [...] "O Teseo, O Teseo mio" [...] (O Theseus, my Theseus"); the two phrases represent Arianna's contrasting emotions of despair and longing. Throughout the lament indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness, until the final iteration of [...] "O Teseo", after which a descending line brings the lament to a quiet conclusion.|$|E

2500|$|An {{imitation}} carillon (a multi-bell <b>musical</b> <b>device)</b> {{was installed}} in the Space Needle, and played {{several times a day}} during the World's Fair. The instrument, built by the Schulmerich Bells Company of Hatfield, Pennsylvania under the name [...] "Carillon Americana," [...] recreated the sounds of 538 bells and was the largest in the world, until eclipsed by a 732 bell instrument at the 1964 New York World's Fair. The operator's console was located in the base of the Space Needle, completely enclosed in glass to allow observation of the musician playing the instrument. [...] It was also capable of being played from a roll, just as a player piano would be. The forty-four stentors (speakers) of the carillon were located underneath the Needle's disc at the 200 foot level, and were audible over the entire fairgrounds and up to ten miles away. The carillon was disassembled after the fair's close.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. The Musing organist: There is a {{peculiar}} felicity in this musical introduction. The poem {{is like an}} improvisation, and was indeed composed much as a musician improvises, with swift grasp of the subtle suggestions of musical tones. It is a dream, an elaborate and somewhat tangled metaphor, full of hidden meaning for the accordant mind, and the poet appropriately gives it a setting of music, the most symbolic of all the arts. It is an allegory, like {{any one of the}} adventures in the Fairie Queen, and from the very beginning the reader must be alive to the symbolic meaning, upon which Lowell, unlike Spenser, places chief emphasis, rather than upon the narrative. Compare the similar <b>musical</b> <b>device</b> in Browning's Abt Vogler and Adelaide Proctor's Lost Chord.|$|E
50|$|Shostakovich uses {{a montage}} of {{different}} styles, including folk music, popular song and atonality. The apparent chaos is given structure by formal <b>musical</b> <b>devices</b> such as canons and quartets, a device taken from Alban Berg's Wozzeck.|$|R
50|$|Musices poeticae is a {{guide to}} composition. It focuses {{primarily}} on counterpoint, and includes nine chapters, which cover topics {{as diverse as the}} definition of music, the definition of sound, intervals which are concords and discords, the proper succession of Consonance and dissonance, musical modes, cadences, composed versus improvised counterpoint, and proper techniques of composition for differing numbers of voices. The most famous chapter is the 7th, with its unique list of specific <b>musical</b> <b>devices</b> which can be used to express different feelings. It is the first in a German Baroque tradition of comparison of <b>musical</b> <b>devices</b> with rhetorical devices, an idea which was to be later expanded by Joachim Burmeister and Mattheson.|$|R

5000|$|In music, {{division}} {{refers to}} a type of ornamentation or variation common in 16th and 17th century music [...] in which each note of a melodic line is [...] "divided" [...] into several shorter, faster-moving notes, often by a rhythmic repetition of a simple <b>musical</b> <b>device</b> such as the trill, turn or cambiata on each note in turn, or {{by the introduction of}} nonchord tones or arpeggio figures.|$|E
5000|$|Stop-time is, {{according}} to Samuel A.

Such stop-time moments are sometimes repeated, creating an illusion of starting and stopping, as, for example, in Scott Joplin's 'The Ragtime Dance' and Jelly Roll Morton's 'King Porter Stomp'." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ground bass or basso ostinato (obstinate bass) {{is a type}} of {{variation}} form in which a bass line, or harmonic pattern (see Chaconne; also common in Elizabethan England as Grounde) is repeated as the basis of a piece underneath variations.
