60|$|Ida {{was in her}} boudoir, a {{tiny little}} tapestried room, as neat and dainty as herself, with low walls hung with Imari plaques and with pretty little Swiss {{brackets}} bearing blue Kaga ware, or the pure white Coalport china. In a low chair beneath a red shaded standing lamp sat Ida, in a diaphanous evening dress of <b>mousseline</b> <b>de</b> <b>soie,</b> the ruddy light tinging her sweet childlike face, and glowing on her golden curls. She sprang up as her sister entered, and {{threw her arms around}} her.|$|E
60|$|We {{had pulled}} up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and {{springing}} down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light <b>mousseline</b> <b>de</b> <b>soie,</b> with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.|$|E

40|$|Summary. — Considering {{the huge}} amount of {{so-called}} "assignats" issued during the first french Revolution (from 1789 up to 1793), it appeared {{of the utmost importance}} to fight against counterfeits. Hence was organised a national contest with the specific purpose of finding and promoting improvements in paper money making. One of the most amazing project to enter this competition was the silk assignat by Jolivet. This assignat, of outstanding rarity, was merely known until 1981 in two specimens. In 2004, the discovery of a new and unpublished variant type incited to reconsider the past studies and has led to the precise historical and technical description of the six remaining « assignats <b>de</b> <b>soie</b> <b>de</b> Jolivet ».
