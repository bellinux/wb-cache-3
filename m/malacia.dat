40|$|Background: Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) {{disorders}} in children {{have never been}} studied using quantified measurements and validated clinical outcome measures. The objectives {{of the study were}} to prospectively examine the relationship between <b>malacia</b> lesions and their respiratory illness profiles. Methods: The site of <b>malacia</b> lesions (eg, tracheomalacia, TBM, and bronchomalacia) were determined, measured, and related to the respective cricoid (ie, airway/cricoid ratio) using the color histogram mode technique. These children and normal control subjects were followed up for 12 months with their respiratory illness profiles determined using the Canadian Acute Respiratory Illness Scale (CARIFS) and cough diary scores. Measurements: Outcome measures were respiratory illness frequency (> 12 months), severity score (day- 1 CARIFS score), and significant cough interfering with daily activity (score of > 3) and illness resolution (time to return to a quarter of CARIFS day 1 score). Results: The group of 116 children were composed of patients with <b>malacia</b> (n 81) and control subjects (n 35). The median age of the group was 2. 1 years (age range, 0. 2 to 17. 3 years). The adjusted relative risk of illness frequency was 2. 1 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 3 to 3. 4), and of significant cough was 7. 2 (95 % CI, 1. 01 to 27. 22) for the <b>malacia</b> group while CARIFS day 1 score was 1. 66 (95 % CI, 1. 1 to 2. 56) compared to control subjects. Illness resolution rates at day 14 in the <b>malacia</b> group trended 25 % slower than those for control subjects. <b>Malacia</b> type and severity of lesions were not associated with increased rates of illness or worse clinical profiles. Conclusion: Children with <b>malacia</b> have an increased likelihood of respiratory illness frequency, severity, significant cough, and tendency for delayed recovery. However, neither the site nor the severity of <b>malacia</b> exhibited any significant dose effect on respiratory illness profiles. © 2008 American College of Chest Physician...|$|E
40|$|Neurovascular {{disorders}} encompass {{those conditions}} {{that result in}} cerebrospinal ischemia, infarction, and hemorrhage. Various vascular and parenchymatous changes {{have been reported in}} dogs and cats in association with vascular anomalies (e. g., aneurysms, telangiectatic hamartomas), cerebral arteriosclerosis, mineral and pigment deposition, <b>malacias</b> and necrosis, cerebral infarction-thrombosis-embolism, inflammatory processes, cerebral hemorrhage, and vascular neoplasms, including intravascular lymphoma (malignant angioendotheliomatosis) [1, 110]. Cerebral ischemia connotes insufficient blood supply to the brain to maintain normal cellular functions. It has been stated that ischemia can be viewed as hypoxia plus hypoglycemia [2]. Brain ischemia may be: a. focal resulting from narrowing/occlusion of cervicocranial vessels or from hypoperfusion of the brain associated with atherothrombosis or embolism, or b. global resulting from systemic hypoperfusion [3]. In atherothrombosis, a localized thrombus forms on an atherosclerotic plaque resulting in disruption of blood flow and subsequent ischemia and/or infarction. In embolism, a brain or spinal cord artery is suddenly occluded by embolic material, usually a thrombus that arises from a distant site such as the heart. Hypovolemia or cardiac pump failure causes a global decrease in cerebral blood flow and can lead to infarction in the border zones between major cerebral arteries (calle...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Controversy remains {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} bronchodilators in wheezy infants. AIMS: To assess the effect of inhaled beta(2) agonists on lung function in infants with <b>malacia</b> or recurrent wheeze, and {{to determine whether a}} negative effect of beta(2) agonists on forced expiratory flow (V'(maxFRC)) is more pronounced in infants with airway <b>malacia,</b> compared to infants with wheeze. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed lung function data of 27 infants: eight with <b>malacia,</b> 19 with recurrent wheeze. Mean (SD) age was 51 (18) weeks. Mean V'(maxFRC) (in Z score) was assessed before and after inhalation of beta(2) agonists. RESULTS: Baseline V'(maxFRC) was below reference values for both groups. Following inhalation of beta(2) agonists the mean (95 % CI) change in mean V'(maxFRC) in Z scores was - 0. 10 (- 0. 26 to 0. 05) and - 0. 33 (- 0. 55 to - 0. 11) for the <b>malacia</b> and wheeze group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In infants with wheeze, inhaled beta(2) agonists caused a significant reduction in mean V'(maxFRC).

40|$|BACKGROUND—Severe tracheobronchial <b>malacia</b> and {{stenosis}} {{are important}} causes of {{morbidity and mortality}} in children in intensive care, but little is known about how best to diagnose these conditions or determine their prognosis.  METHODS—The records of all 62 children in whom one or both of these conditions had been diagnosed by contrast cinetracheobronchography in our intensive care unit in the period 1986 - 95 were studied.  RESULTS—Seventy four per cent of the 62 children had congenital heart disease; none was a preterm baby with airways disease associated with prolonged ventilation. Fifteen of the children had airway stenosis without malacia; three died because of the stenosis and two died from other causes. Twenty eight of the 47 children with <b>malacia</b> died; only eight children survived without developmental or respiratory handicap. All children needing ventilation for <b>malacia</b> for longer than 14 consecutive days died if their bronchogram showed moderate or severe <b>malacia</b> of either main bronchus (15 cases), or <b>malacia</b> of any severity of both bronchi (three additional cases); all children needing ventilation for <b>malacia</b> for longer than 21 consecutive days died if their bronchogram showed <b>malacia</b> of any severity of the trachea or a main bronchus (three additional cases). These findings were strongly associated with a fatal outcome (p< 0. 00005); they were present in 21 children (all of whom died) and absent in 26 (of whom seven died, six from non-respiratory causes). They had a positive predictive value for death of 100 %, but the lower limit of the 95 % confidence interval was 83. 9 % so up to 16 % of patients meeting the criteria might survive.  CONCLUSION—In this series the findings on contrast cinetracheobronchography combined with the duration of ventilation provided a useful guide to the prognosis of children with tracheobronchomalacia. The information provided by bronchoscopy was less useful. ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: We report our {{experience}} in combining tracheobronchography and angiocardiography {{in the assessment}} of a selected cohort of paediatric cardiac patients with problematic airway disorders. Methodology: The clinical records of 11 patients who underwent 17 studies at a median age of 5. 5 months (range 3 months to 10. 8 years) were reviewed. Tracheobronchography and angiocardiography were performed under general anaesthesia using a non-ionic contrast agent. The findings were compared with those of flexible bronchoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: Seven patients had cardiac lesions associated with vascular anomalies potentially compressing the airway, while four had no identifiable aberrant or enlarged vessels. All examinations but one were performed without complications. Tracheobronchography demonstrated extrinsic vascular compression with secondary airway <b>malacia</b> in three (27 %), intrinsic tracheobronchial stenosis in five (45 %), and airway <b>malacia</b> in three patients (27 %). Precise measurement of the airway calibre and real-time fluoroscopic monitoring facilitated transcatheter tracheobronchial interventions (six balloon dilations, three stent implantations) in four patients. In conjunction with angiocardiography, cine-tracheobronchography provided detailed information on the spatial relationship between vascular and airway structures in all patients; allowed dynamic assessment of airway malacia; and facilitated preoperative planning in six patients. In contrast, bronchoscopy failed to differentiate <b>malacia</b> from extrinsic compression in four patients (36 %), while MRI, performed in six patients, was unsatisfactory in one due to a motion artefact and failed to diagnose airway <b>malacia</b> and extrinsic compression in three patients. Conclusions: Tracheobronchography is relatively safe in paediatric cardiac patients. Combined tracheobronchography and angiocardiography, a less operator-dependent imaging modality compared to bronchoscopy and MRI, delineated the airway and vascular anatomy in detail; facilitated preoperative planning; and permitted transcatheter tracheo-bronchial interventions. The dynamic capability of tracheobronchography supplements that of flexible bronchoscopy and MRI in the diagnosis of airway <b>malacia.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Children with airway <b>malacia</b> {{often have}} {{protracted}} courses of airway infections, because dynamic airway collapse during coughing results in impaired mucociliary clearance. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the effect of the mucolytic drug recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) on the recovery of respiratory symptoms in children with airway <b>malacia</b> and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS: In a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial, 40 children with airway <b>malacia</b> and LRTI were randomly assigned to receive either 2. 5 mg nebulized rhDNase or placebo twice daily for 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in the cough diary score (CDS) (scale 0 - 5) from baseline to the second week of treatment. Secondary endpoints were VAS symptom scores for cough, dyspnea, and difficulty in expectorating sputum, need for an antibiotic course, and lung function data (FVC, FEV(1), FEF(75), R(int(e))). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the mean change in CDSs from baseline between the rhDNase group and the placebo group (mean difference for daytime 0. 19 (95 % CI - 0. 53 to 0. 90); for nighttime 0. 38 (95 % CI - 0. 30 to 1. 05). Proportions of patients requiring antibiotics, and the mean changes in symptom scores and lung function from baseline did not significantly differ between both groups. CONCLUSION: Treatment with 2 weeks of nebulized rhDNase does not enhance recovery or reduce the need for antibiotics in children with airway <b>malacia</b> and LRTI.

40|$|Abstract. In 15 pigs {{affected}} with cerebrospinal angiopathy {{accompanied by}} demyelination and <b>malacia,</b> the main symptoms were diarrhea and subsequent circling, spasms, sudden forward movements, ataxia, and inability {{to hold the}} head straight. Escherichiu coli was isolated in a pure culture from the small intestine of pigs with diarrhea. The only gross change was {{a slight increase in}} cerebrospinal fluid. Histologic examination showed vascular lesions, demyelination, and <b>malacia,</b> most commonly located in the medulla oblongata, pons, and mid-brain. The vascular lesions were degenerative and there were necrotic changes of the vessel walls and formation of periodic acid-Schiff-positive perivascular eosinophilic droplets. Ultra-structurally, the swollen astrocytes around the vessels had many osmiophilic bodies in their cytoplasm with no limiting membrane. Demyelination and <b>malacia,</b> as well as vascular lesions, were considered to be the characteristic changes of cerebrospinal angiopathy. Our study suggests that E. coli may be a cause of cerebrospinal angiopathy. Swine cerebrospinal angiopathy was reported first as a condition characterized by vascular lesions of the central nervous system [8]. Since that report, similar symptoms have been observed by many workers [l, 3, 7, 9, 10, 12, 201. Perivascular eosinophili...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveOur study {{describes}} {{the results from}} surgical slide tracheoplasty (STP) in children with long segment tracheal stenosis. MethodsDemographic and preoperative conditions, operative details, and outcome measures, including the need for endoscopic airway intervention and mortality, were collected for children undergoing STP between February 1995 and December 2012. ResultsOne hundred one patients (median age, 5. 8 months; range, 5 days- 15 years) underwent STP. Seventy-two patients (71. 3 %) had associated cardiovascular anomalies. Preoperative ventilation was necessary in 56 patients (55. 4 %), whereas extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required in 10 patients (9. 9 %). Abnormal bronchial arborization was present in 39 children (38. 6 %), which included 13 patients (12. 8 %) with an anomalous right upper lobe bronchus and 17 patients (16. 8 %) with tracheal trifurcation. Airway stenosis extended into 1 or both bronchi in 24 patients (23. 7 %) and preoperative <b>malacia</b> was present in 24 patients (23. 7 %). STP was extended into the bronchus in 47 patients (46. 5 %). Overall survival was 88. 2 % (mortality in 12 patients). Post-STP balloon dilation was necessary in 45 patients (44. 6 %) and stenting was required in 22 patients (21. 8 %). Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (P < . 05), preoperative <b>malacia</b> (P < . 001), and bronchial stenosis (P < . 05) to be adverse predictors of survival.
