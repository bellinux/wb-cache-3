25|$|Family {{members who}} {{identify}} {{more with the}} culture of their home country may experience frustration when they attempt to instill their cultural values into younger family members. Popular media, schools, and peers act as powerful socializing agents {{and members of the}} older generation <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> they cannot compete with these pervasive cultural and social forces. Parents may blame television and magazines for the unwanted change they see in their children and if they decide to act by cracking down on their children's access to popular media, this may lead to further generational schisms.|$|E

25|$|Parents <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> their {{authority}} over their children is weakened {{because there are}} greater resources available in the United States and children are thus less dependent upon their parents for financial support. Some parents believe that children's greater independence also makes them less likely to heed parent's teachings and advice. In particular, children in immigrant families may have greater access to education and work opportunities. These, in turn, can help facilitate social mobility, raising the socioeconomic status of subsequent generations of immigrants relative to first generation immigrants (see Second generation immigrants in the United States).|$|E
25|$|To {{begin with}} {{cognitive}} responses in infidelity, individuals {{whom have been}} cheated on experience jealousy cognitively for many reasons. They <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> their partner has lost interest in them and feel that they cannot compare to the persons with whom they are being cheated on with (Johnson, 2017). Therefore, they anticipate {{the loss of their}} partner's emotional interest in them and become jealous for more clear reasons. They could believe that they are losing someone who they care deeply about, or they may feel as if their partner is mad at them and doing it out of spite, etc. The anticipation of jealous feelings towards an individual’s significant other causes a cognitive response, even without the burden of proof.|$|E
25|$|Symbolic racism {{represents}} {{a form of}} resistance {{to change in the}} racial status quo based on moral feelings that blacks violate such traditional American values as individualism and self-reliance, the work ethic, obedience, and discipline. Whites <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> people should be rewarded on their merits, which in turn should be based on hard work and diligent service. Hence symbolic racism should find its most vociferous expression on political issues that involve 'unfair' government assistance to blacks: welfare ('welfare cheats could find work if they tried'); 'reverse discrimination' and racial quotas ('blacks should not be given a status they have not earned'); 'forced' busing ('whites have worked hard for their neighborhoods, and for their neighborhood schools'); or 'free' abortions for the poor ('if blacks behaved morally, they would not need abortions').|$|E

25|$|With the {{enactment}} of the 1991 Local Government Code, municipalities and cities have both become more empowered to deal with local issues. Regular municipalities now share many of the same powers and responsibilities as chartered cities, but its citizens and/or leaders <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> it might be to their best interest to get a larger share of internal revenue allotment (IRA) and acquire additional powers by becoming a city, especially if the population has greatly increased and local economy has become more robust. On the other hand, due to the higher property taxes that would be imposed after cityhood, many citizens have become wary of their town's conversion into a city, even if the municipality had already achieved a high degree of urbanization and has an annual income that already exceeds that of many existing lower-income cities. This has been among the cases made against the cityhood bids of many high-income and populous municipalities surrounding Metro Manila, most notably Bacoor and Dasmariñas (which finally became cities in June 2012 and November 2009 respectively), which for many years have been more qualified to become cities than others.|$|E
25|$|Plastic {{changes to}} the body schema are active and continuous. For example, gradual {{changes to the}} body schema must occur over the {{lifetime}} of an individual {{as he or she}} grows and absolute and relative sizes of body parts change over his or her life span. The development of the body schema has also been shown to occur in young children. One study showed that with these children (9-, 14-, and 19-month-olds), older children handled spoons so as to optimally and comfortably grip them for use, whereas younger children tended to reach with their dominant hand, regardless of the orientation of the spoon and eventual ease of use. Short-term plasticity has been shown with the integration of tools into the body schema. The rubber hand illusion has also shown the rapid reorganization of the body schema on the timescale of seconds, showing the high level of plasticity and speed with which the body schema reorganizes. In the Illusion, participants view a dummy hand being stroked with a paintbrush, while their own hand is stroked identically. Participants <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the touches on their hand are coming from the dummy hand, and even that the dummy hand is, in some way, their own hand.|$|E
25|$|Psychologist Daniel Wegner {{has argued}} that an introspection {{illusion}} contributes to belief in psychokinesis. He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to turn on a light) is followed by action (such as flicking a light switch) in a reliable way, but the underlying neural mechanisms are outside awareness. Hence, though subjects <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> they directly introspect their own free will, the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory of apparent mental causation acknowledges the influence of David Hume's view of the mind. This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and when it goes wrong there can be an illusion of control. This can happen when an external event follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link. As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on magical thinking in which subjects were induced to think they had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a basketball player taking a series of free throws. When they were instructed to visualize him making his shots, they {{felt that they had}} contributed to his success. Other experiments designed to create an illusion of psychokinesis have demonstrated that this depends, to some extent, on the subject's prior belief in psychokinesis.|$|E

25|$|An {{interesting}} {{aspect of}} cultural capital that sometimes {{comes into play}} in immigrant families is familiarity with American laws. Parents may find that U.S. law is in conflict with their traditional means of disciplining their children. While parents may be accustomed to certain parental rights in their home country, these rights may not be protected in American society. There may be cases in which outside agents—either school officials, police officers, or government officials—become involved in conflicts between parents and children. This is particularly true in cases of alleged physical abuse. Children, who may be more familiar with American laws, can use this knowledge to gain assistance from individuals outside of the family. The involvement of outside agents may tip the traditional power balance within the family and affords family members who are {{more familiar with the}} rules and norms of the United States a certain degree of power over family members who are not as familiar with these laws. Among immigrants who come from cultures with strict hierarchies based on age, such interventions can be devastating to parents who <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> their authority has been undermined. Family members who are better assimilated into American culture are more able, and probably more likely, to utilize their knowledge of American laws to change the dynamics of family relations. This generates inequality based on degree of assimilation since those who are less assimilated are more likely to lose face {{as the result of the}} penetration of such laws into the traditionally private domain of the family.|$|E
500|$|Rogan {{writes in}} the book's introduction: [...] "an {{important}} caveat to any serious, well-researched biography or study of Morrison's life is that the reader {{should be aware that}} a number of allegations against the subject cannot be featured in print for legal reasons. The author <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the final portrayal is far too flattering in certain places, while the reader who neglects to read between the lines may think the biographer could have been a little more sympathetic at times. Death alone will open this Pandora's box." [...] Morrison himself is quoted on the first page of the book, saying: [...] "Rogan's got something to hide. What's he hiding? I'd like to do a book on him." ...|$|E
500|$|Verbal {{report is}} widely {{considered}} to be the most reliable indicator of consciousness, but it raises a number of issues. [...] For one thing, if verbal reports are treated as observations, akin to observations in other branches of science, then the possibility arises that they may contain errors—but it is difficult {{to make sense of the}} idea that subjects could be wrong about their own experiences, and even more difficult to see how such an error could be detected. [...] Daniel Dennett has argued for an approach he calls heterophenomenology, which means treating verbal reports as stories that may or may not be true, but his ideas about how to do this have not been widely adopted. [...] Another issue with verbal report as a criterion is that it restricts the field of study to humans who have language: [...] this approach cannot be used to study consciousness in other species, pre-linguistic children, or people with types of brain damage that impair language. [...] As a third issue, philosophers who dispute the validity of the Turing test <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> it is possible, at least in principle, for verbal report to be dissociated from consciousness entirely: [...] a philosophical zombie may give detailed verbal reports of awareness in the absence of any genuine awareness.|$|E

2500|$|Maternal {{guilt and}} shame is often {{affected}} by how a mother feeds her infant.

These feelings occur in both bottle- and breast- feeding mothers, although for different reasons. Bottle feeding mothers <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> they should be breastfeeding. Conversely, breastfeeding mothers may feel forced to feed in uncomfortable circumstances. Some may see breastfeeding as, “indecent, disgusting, animalistic, sexual, and even possibly a perverse act." [...] Advocates use [...] "nurse-ins" [...] to show support for breastfeeding in public. Some advocates emphasize providing women with education on breastfeeding's benefits as well as problem-solving skills.|$|E
