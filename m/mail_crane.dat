5000|$|When {{the mail}} clerk of the Railway Post Office car grabbed the catcher pouch on the <b>mail</b> <b>crane</b> he would {{at the same}} time kick out the {{outgoing}} mail for delivery to that village. The idea behind the catcher pouch was that there could be an exchange of mail to villages too small to justify the train stopping. The complete transfer technique (tossing out the outgoing mail a second before grabbing the catcher pouch) required much skill and potentially could cause harm or even death for those not trained properly. Another reason why the catcher pouch and <b>mail</b> <b>crane</b> were developed is so the train did not have to slow down just for the exchange of mail ( [...] method).|$|E
50|$|The catcher pouch is a {{specialized}} form of sack made of an extra tough canvas material and had metal rings on each end {{so they could}} attach to {{the arm of a}} railway <b>mail</b> bag <b>crane.</b> The body of the pouch was strengthened by leather bindings both at the top and bottom. A Registered Mail pouch came also with a leather bottom and had a special postal lock to secure the contents. A leather strap was secured around the center of the canvas body of the catcher pouch when it was readied to be snatched by a passing train's mail hook.|$|R
5000|$|A catcher pouch was a mail bag used by Railway Post Offices of {{the nineteenth}} century and the early twentieth century. Its use was limited to exchanges onto moving trains. The {{specially}} constructed catcher pouch was grabbed by the catcher mechanism in the passing railway car and the catcher pouch would release from the holding rings on the <b>mail</b> <b>crane.</b> This technique was known as [...] "mail on the fly". Starting in the 1870s the use of this technique of the Railway Mail Service was an important issue in the United States. It was a popular technique and the backbone of the United States Postal Service through the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|Catcher pouches {{could not}} be used for any other purpose. The catcher pouch was to be used only for letters (sometimes {{newspapers}} were an exception). The maximum weight of a filled catcher pouch was to be 50 pounds. The catcher pouch was to be locked and placed upside down on the <b>mail</b> <b>crane</b> no sooner than 10 minutes before the scheduled arrival of the Mail Train. The catcher pouch was to be tied in the middle before it was to be transferred. If a small amount of mail, it should be put in the lower half below the tie strap. If a large amount of mail, it should be divided equally between the upper half and {{the lower half of the}} catcher pouch.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{development}} of passenger cars progressed, so too did {{the development}} of RPO cars. The first plans for RPO car designs were based on light baggage car frames and bodies, which sometimes resulted in catastrophe for RMS employees when the trains were involved in accidents. From 1900 to 1906 some 70 workers were killed in train wrecks while on duty in the RPOs, leading to demands for stronger steel cars. The RMS developed its first standards for car design in 1891 {{to address some of}} these issues. In 1912, the Railway Mail Service developed a set of strength requirements for new cars in an effort to push the car building companies into using steel for the cars' major structural components and underframes. The core of the requirements was that each car should be able to withstand a buffer force of at least 400,000 pounds. This requirement was doubled to 800,000 pounds in a 1938 revision of the standards. The requirements were again strengthened in 1945 with specifications that precluded the use of aluminium for framing and major structural components. The 1945 revisions also included a requirement for end posts to prevent telescoping {{in the event of a}} collision. Car manufacturers adopted these requirements and carried them through to all other models of passenger cars that they built.An interesting feature of most RPO cars was a hook that could be used to snatch a leather or canvas pouch of outgoing mail hanging on a track-side <b>mail</b> <b>crane</b> at smaller towns where the train did not stop.
