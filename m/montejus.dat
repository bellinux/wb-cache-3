50|$|Although the {{molasses}} {{storage tanks}} and <b>Montejus</b> pit {{near the river}} were demolished {{before the end of}} World War Two, and the Agitator and Cooling House, Settling Tank House, and Laboratory/Bungalow have disappeared since World War Two, a number of the main buildings involved in the process of producing acetate of lime are still present on the site. However, the top two floors of the Acidifier House were removed some time after 1965, and with its modern cladding the building no longer resembles its earlier form.|$|E
50|$|The terms {{acid egg}} and <b>montejus</b> (or monte-jus) are {{sometimes}} used interchangeably {{to refer to}} a device with no moving parts formerly used instead of a pump in order to transfer difficult liquids. The principle is that a strong vessel containing the liquid is pressurized with gas or steam, forcing the liquid into a pipe (usually vertical upwards) thereby causing flow. When the liquid has been transferred, the pressure is released and more liquid is put in via gravity. It is thus cyclic in operation. The same principle has been used to lift water and called an air displacement pump or intermittent gas-lift pump, and has been applied to pumping oil up from the formation.Its use has largely been superseded by modern pumps, but it is still used sometimes for special tasks.|$|E
