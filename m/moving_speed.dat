25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1862, Union Brig. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis entered Arkansas and pursued the Confederates with his 10,500 strong Army of the Southwest. Curtis {{collected}} his four divisions and 50 artillery guns and moved into Benton County, Arkansas, following a stream called Sugar Creek. Along it on the northern side he found an excellent defensive position and began to fortify it, expecting an assault from the south. Van Dorn chose not to attack Curtis's entrenched position head on. Instead he split his force into two, one division led by Price and the other by McCulloch, and ordered them to march north, hoping to reunite in Curtis' rear. Van Dorn decided to leave behind his supply wagons {{in order to increase}} their <b>moving</b> <b>speed,</b> a decision that would prove critical. Several other factors caused the proposed junction to be delayed, such as the lack of proper gear for the Confederates (some said to lack even shoes) for a forced march, felled trees placed across their path, their exhausted and hungry condition, and the late arrival of McCulloch's men. These delays allowed the Union commander to reposition part of his army throughout March 6 and meet the unexpected attack from his rear, placing Curtis' forces between the two wings of the Confederate army. Plus when Van Dorn's advance guard accidentally ran into Union patrols near Elm Springs, the Federals were alerted to his approach.|$|E

Conventional phase-based transceivers {{are unable to}} meet the needs of the large Doppler shift caused by <b>moving</b> <b>speeds</b> over 200 km/h unless they adopt complicated frequency-shift estimation and compensation. The chirp signal is a good candidate since it is a constant-modulus time-frequency signal and does not require phase detection.

40|$|Ubiquitous data {{collection}} enables mobile users {{to collect data}} from the surrounding wireless sensors along their walks. However, the limited contact time and the wireless capacity constrain the amount of data that can be collected by the mobile users. Quality of Service (QoS) becomes very important for mobile users to collect sensing data that can maximize their information value. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, we are the first to propose a distributed algorithm that can support QoS ubiquitous {{data collection}} for multiple mobile users. Our distributed algorithm constructs the data collection trees adaptively to the dynamic <b>moving</b> <b>speeds</b> and the available capacity of the mobile users. It allocates capacity for receiving high priority data to maximize the information value with low communication overheads. Our algorithm supports smooth data collection for multiple mobile users with independent movements. We provide analysis and extensive simulations to evaluate the information value, energy efficiency and scalability of our distributed solution. The results showed that our distributed algorithm can improve information value up to 50 % and reduce energy consumption to half compared with the existing approach. Our algorithm also scales perfectly well with increasing number of mobile users and <b>moving</b> <b>speeds...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} {{applications}} of large scale sensor networks {{in which both}} the stimulus and the data collection stations are mobile (i. e. animal tracking, battlefield chasing). TTDD is a scalable and energy-efficient data dissemination model designed {{for this type of}} scenarios. However, TTDD only focused on handling mobile sinks. In this paper, we extend TTDD to deal with both mobile sources and sinks and evaluate the effectiveness of two potential extended TTDD schemes. Simulation results are presented to compare their performance in terms of energy consumption, delay and success rate. It is shown that the two schemes have similar performance when the <b>moving</b> <b>speeds</b> of the phenomena objects are slow.
