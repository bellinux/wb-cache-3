50|$|The Sheridan Flouring Mills, {{also known}} as the Mill Inn, are an {{industrial}} complex in Sheridan, Wyoming. The mills were a major component of the economy of north central Wyoming, providing collection, storage and milling of locally-produced wheat and other grains into flour and other <b>milled</b> <b>products.</b> The original mill was established by Captain Scott W. Snively in the early 1890s. The Sheridan Milling and Manufacturing Company was sold to J.W. Denio in 1903, who operated the mill at its location on Broadway Avenue near downtown Sheridan. A catastrophic fire destroyed this mill in 1919, resulting in the purchase of a new location on Coffeen Avenue and construction of a much larger mill.|$|E
50|$|Sprouting or pre-harvest {{germination}} {{is caused}} by damp or rainy weather conditions during {{the final stage of}} maturation of the crop. The germination causes an accelerated production of the starch degrading enzyme alpha-amylase. Severely sprouted grain kernels can contain several thousand times the amount of enzyme of sound unsprouted kernels. Because of this, very low levels of severely sprouted kernels mixed into sound wheat can cause the entire lot to exhibit significant amylase activity. Since its introduction in the early 1960s, the FN test has become a world standard in the grain and flour milling industries for measuring alpha-amylase activity in wheat, durum wheat, triticale, rye and barley, as well as <b>milled</b> <b>products</b> made from these grains.|$|E

One of the major attractions is the Panoaya Hacienda. The main hacienda building houses the Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz Museum; it is featured in the reverse of the $200 pesos Mexican note. Sor Juana come to live at Panoaya in 1651 when she was three years old to live with her mother and grandfather. She learned to read and write and stayed until she was sent to live in Mexico City in 1663. The hacienda lay in ruins for the last century or so until it was rehabilitated in 1999 at a cost of more than 10 million pesos.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the maximal amount of concentrate and forage that could be replaced with a new wet corn <b>milling</b> <b>product.</b> The corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> contained 23. 1 % crude protein, 9. 9 % ruminally undegradable protein, 13. 7 % acid detergent fiber, 40. 3 % neutral detergent fiber, and 2. 6 % ether extract (% of dry matter; DM). In experiment 1, 16 Holstein cows were {{assigned to one of}} four diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 28 -d periods. The four diets contained 54. 3 % forage (alfalfa:corn silages, 1 : 1 DM basis) with the wet corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> replacing 0, 50, 75, or 100 % of the concentrate portion (corn and soybean meal) of the diet (DM basis). The diets containing wet corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> resulted in 7. 8 % lower DM intake, equivalent milk production (28. 5 kg/ d), and 13. 6 % greater efficiency of 4 % fat-corrected milk (FCM) production than the control diet. There was no effect of diet on ruminal pH. In experiment 2, 16 Holstein cows were assigned to one of four diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 28 -d periods. The 100 % concentrate replacement diet from experiment 1 was used as control diet. For the test diets, forage was replaced with 15, 30, or 45 % of the corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> (DM basis). Efficiency of FCM production (1. 16) was not affected by diet. Rumination time was reduced for the 30 and 45 % forage replacement diets, but ruminal pH was unaffected. In experiment 3, 30 Holstein cows were assigned at parturition to either a control diet (no corn <b>milling</b> <b>product)</b> or a diet containing 40 % corn milling feed in place of both forage and concentrate (optimal levels from experiments 1 and 2) for 9 wk. The diet containing corn milling feed resulted in 21 % greater efficiency of FCM production than the control diet.

40|$|Although {{regarded}} as a low-risk commodity, wheat flour-based mixes have been implicated in several food safety incidents. The present thesis is a compilation of five scientific manuscripts {{on the effect of}} weather variation, milling steps and implementation of pre-milling interventions on the microbiological quality and safety of wheat and <b>milled</b> <b>products.</b> The first manuscript is a review of the microbiological quality and safety of wheat-based products. Despite the low water activity, wheat flour may harbor dormant but viable microorganisms, which could lead to safety concerns when flour is used to produce refrigerated dough products. The second manuscript illustrates the effect of climatic conditions on the microbiological quality of wheat, where wheat grown under higher relative humidity and higher maximum temperature may be more susceptible to lower microbiological quality. In the third manuscript, the effect of the milling steps on the microbial load of wheat <b>milled</b> <b>products</b> is reported. While the cleaning and tempering steps did not affect the initial microbial counts, the grinding process caused a redistribution and concentration of microbial contaminants into the bran and germ fractions. The fourth manuscript reports the effect of novel tempering solutions on reducing microbial load in wheat prior to milling. Results showed that tempering solutions containing organic acids and NaCl were capable of effectively reducing the microflora of wheat kernels when compared to the traditional tempering process. In the last manuscript, the combined antimicrobial effects of organic acid and NaCl during tempering and its impact on flour functionality were evaluated. The results indicated a synergistic effect between lactic acid and NaCl, which was very remarkable in reducing microbial counts. Moreover, the impact on mixing, pasting, and baking properties was minimal. Adviser: Andréia Bianchin...|$|E
