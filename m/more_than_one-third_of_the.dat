By September 19 it had passed Resident Evil: Extinction $97.1 million overseas total. The following day it had surpassed Extinction total of $103.2 million overseas, 148.8 million worldwide, to become the highest-grossing entry of the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} the Aristarchus plateau has been the site of many {{reported}} transient lunar phenomena, {{with a total of}} 122 such reports by 2007; the highest recorded for any lunar feature. Such events include temporary obscurations and colorations of the surface, and catalogues of these show that <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most reliable spottings come from this locale. In 1971 when Apollo 15 passed 110 kilometers above the Aristarchus plateau, a significant rise in alpha particles was detected. These particles are believed to be caused by the decay of radon-222, a radioactive gas with a half-life of only 3.8 days. The Lunar Prospector mission later confirmed radon-222 emissions from this crater. These observations could be explained by either the slow and visually imperceptible diffusion of gas to the surface, or by discrete explosive events.|$|E

25|$|The first {{claim on}} the reef, the Golden Gate PC, was taken up by Joseph Hardy and James Fulton in April 1886. However, yields from the Golden Gate claims were meagre until 1891, when a rich ore chute was {{discovered}} in Rogers' No. 1 Golden Gate mine. The large, well defined, north/northwest bearing Golden Gate reef contained gold- bearing quartz with abundant sulphides and was mined over a total length of 2.5km. Records suggest that payable ore was limited to a vertical depth of approximately 90m. Its most productive years, between 1886 and 1911, showed a yield of 483,000 ounces of gold from 244,364 tons of ore. This production totalled <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire Croydon yield.|$|E
25|$|In the Sandgate area, to {{the east}} of the city, and beside the river, resided the close-knit {{community}} of keelmen and their families. They were so called because they worked on the keels, boats that were used to transfer coal from the river banks to the waiting colliers, for export to London and elsewhere. In the 1630s, about 7,000 out of 20,000 inhabitants of Newcastle died of plague, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population.

50|$|A study {{released}} by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities in early 2009 found that women outnumbered men as municipal chief administrative officers or city managers - a position which is hired, not elected - in Canada. However, they still lagged significantly behind men as elected municipal councillors and mayors, representing just 23 per cent of all elected municipal officials. Only in Canada's three territories, Nunavut, Yukon and the Northwest Territories, did women represent <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> elected municipal officials {{at the time of}} the study, and the Yukon was the only province or territory in all <b>of</b> Canada where <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> all mayors were women.|$|R
25|$|Between 1003 and 1526, Transylvania was a {{voivodeship}} in the Kingdom of Hungary, {{led by a}} voivode {{appointed by}} the King of Hungary.

Later, in 1570, the kingdom transformed into the Principality of Transylvania, which was ruled primarily by Calvinist Hungarian princes. During that time, the ethnic composition of Transylvania transformed from an estimated near equal number of the ethnic groups to a Romanian majority. Vasile Lupu estimates their number already <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population of Transylvania {{in a letter to the}} sultan around 1650. For most of this period, Transylvania, maintaining its internal autonomy, was under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
25|$|West Virginia was {{the only}} state in the Union to {{separate}} from a Confederate state (Virginia) during the American Civil War.

Almost immediately after that vote, a mass meeting at Clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to a convention to meet in Wheeling on May 13, 1861. When this First Wheeling Convention met, 425 delegates from 25 counties were present, though <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one-third</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> delegates were from the northern panhandle area, but soon there was a division of sentiment.|$|E

Relief pitcher Ray King was traded to Colorado. Right fielder Larry Walker retired. Brought in to replace the {{departed}} Cardinals were right fielder Juan Encarnación, starting pitcher Sidney Ponson, relief pitchers Braden Looper and Ricardo Rincón, all via free agency, and second baseman Aaron Miles, acquired in the Ray King trade.
