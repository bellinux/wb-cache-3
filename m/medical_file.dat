Hubbard's post-war correspondence with the VA was also included, including letters in which he requested psychiatric treatment to address his [...] "long periods of moroseness" [...] and [...] "suicidal inclinations." [...] He continued to complain to the VA about various physical ailments into the 1950s, well after he had founded Dianetics; the Times noted that, significantly, Hubbard had promised that Dianetics would provide [...] "a cure for the very ailments that plagued the author himself then and throughout his life, including allergies, arthritis, ulcers and heart problems."

2500|$|Mihai Eminescu died at 4am, on 15 June 1889 at the Caritas Institute, a {{sanatorium}} run by Dr. Suțu {{and located}} on Plantelor Street Sector 2, Bucharest. Eminescu's last wish was {{a glass of}} milk, which the attending doctor slipped through the metallic peephole of the [...] "cell" [...] where he spent the last hours of his life. In response to this favor he {{was said to have}} whispered, [...] "I'm crumbled". The next day, on 16 June 1889 he was officially declared deceased and legal papers to that effect were prepared by doctors Suțu and Petrescu, who submitted the official report. This paperwork is seen as being ambiguous, because the poet's cause of death is not clearly stated and there was no indication of any other underlying condition that may have so suddenly resulted in his death. In fact both the poet's <b>medical</b> <b>file</b> and autopsy report indicate symptoms of a mental and not physical disorder. Moreover, at the autopsy performed by Dr. Tomescu and then by Dr. Marinescu from the laboratory at Babeș-Bolyai University, the brain could not be studied, because a nurse inadvertently forgot it on an open window, where it quickly decomposed.|$|E
