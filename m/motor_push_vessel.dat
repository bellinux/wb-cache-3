25|$|The {{remaining}} towing and {{salvage equipment}} was retained {{for some time}} after the conversion so that, if necessary, Herakles could perform normal tug duties while not employed as a pusher. However, it appears that they were later removed completely as the towing gear was no longer listed for Herakles on Alfons Håkans's website unlike {{with the rest of}} the tug fleet, making her purely a <b>pusher</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|R

2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of the outboard motor the [...] "semi-dory" [...] or [...] "half-dory" [...] was developed. [...] Because typical dory bottoms are so narrow, the thrust of an outboard <b>motor</b> <b>pushes</b> the stern of the dory down creating a very unstable and inefficient boat. The semi-dory is basically a Swampscott dory with the stern widened and the rocker straightened aft to support the thrust of the outboard motor.|$|R
25|$|Steel is a Finnish <b>pusher</b> <b>vessel</b> {{owned and}} {{operated}} by ESL Shipping. It is part of the Finnpusku integrated tug and barge system developed in the 1980s by Finnlines, a Finnish shipping company that also managed the vessel until 2003, in co-operation with Rautaruukki for the transportation needs of the steel company. The vessel, built by Hollming in Rauma, Finland, as Finn, was delivered on 28 April 1987 and has since been used mainly to supply raw materials to the Raahe Steel Works.|$|R
2500|$|In 1991 Herakles was {{converted}} to a <b>pusher</b> <b>vessel</b> by Oy Laivateollisuus Ab, Turku. The conversion also included refitting the existing barges with new coupling devices since Herakles, having considerably smaller breadth than the original Finnpusku pushers and a different hull shape, was incompatible with the original rigid three-point Wärtsilä Marine Locomotive coupling. Herakles and the barges were fitted with Japanese Articouple K articulated coupling system that, by forming a hinge between the two vessels, allowed free pitching of the tug relative to the barge.|$|R

40|$|Dust {{cyclones}} are {{a cost-effective}} way {{to clean the}} air that transports materials within a cotton gin before it is released to the atmosphere. Operating cyclones at the proper entrance velocity is important to maximize their dust collection efficiency and because fan <b>motors</b> <b>pushing</b> air through cyclones consume {{a significant portion of}} the energy used by a modern cotton gin. Because design recommendations for dust cyclones are different now than they were when cyclone operating parameters were first studied, re-examining entrance velocity seemed timely.

500|$|For centuries, the Doom Bar was {{regarded}} as a significant danger to ships—to be approached with caution to avoid running aground.

30|$|The one-part foam type robot has {{a single}} tilted foam {{canister}} on the body part, which can eject foam vertically downward through a φ 6.5 mm silicon tube. The foam ejection is controlled by a servo-motor (Dynamixel MX- 28, Robotis Corp.), where the <b>motor</b> <b>pushes</b> the trigger of the canister. We incorporated a shut-off mechanism {{at the tip of}} the nozzle, because foam curing occurs in the ejection nozzle. The shut-off mechanism is implemented by a slide-rail action, whereby the silicone tube becomes flat. The slide-rail is linked to the ejection control servo-motor, and shuts down the tube according to the motor rotation. We can therefore realize both a shutdown and ejection mechanism using a single motor by this mechanism.|$|R

50|$|LIMs provide {{traction}} through {{the interaction of}} magnetic fields generated on the vehicle and a fixed external conductor. The external conductor was normally made of plates of aluminium, chosen due to its high conductivity in relation to its price. The active portion of the motor consists of a conventional electric motor winding stretched out under the vehicle. When the motor windings are energised, an opposing magnetic field is induced in the nearby reaction plate, which causes the two to repel each other. By moving the fields down the windings, the <b>motor</b> <b>pushes</b> itself along the plate with the same force that is normally used to create rotation in a conventional motor. A LIM {{eliminates the need for}} strong physical contact with the track, requiring instead a strong reaction plate. It has no moving parts, a major advantage over conventional traction.|$|R

25|$|Planning for {{the next}} NASA mission to Jupiter began in 1977, just as the two Voyager probes were launched. Rather than {{performing}} a flyby of the Jupiter system like all the missions preceding it, the Galileo spacecraft would orbit Jupiter to perform close-up observations of the planet and its many moons, including Io, as well as deliver a Jovian atmospheric probe. Originally scheduled to be launched via the Space Shuttle in 1982, delays resulting from development issues with the shuttle and upper-stage <b>motor</b> <b>pushed</b> the launch back, and in 1986 the Challenger disaster delayed Galileo's launch even further. Finally, on October 18, 1989, Galileo began its journey aboard the shuttle Atlantis. En route to Jupiter, the high-gain antenna, folded up like an umbrella to allow the spacecraft to fit in the shuttle cargo bay, failed to open completely. For {{the rest of the}} mission, data from the spacecraft would have to be transmitted back to Earth at a much lower data rate using the low-gain antenna. Despite this setback, data compression algorithms uploaded to Galileo allowed it to complete most of its science goals at Jupiter.|$|R
