50|$|In addition, in 10, Wang also instituted an {{unprecedented}} tax—the income tax - {{at the rate}} of 10 percent of profits, for professionals and skilled labor.

25|$|The modernists survived {{this debate}} {{with most of}} their {{policies}} intact, with only the <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>liquor</b> abolished, although Sang was later executed in 80 BCE for treason.

They briefly succeeded in getting the central government <b>monopolies</b> <b>on</b> salt and iron abolished from 44 to 41 BCE, though this was unsuccessful and the monopolies resumed until the end of Wang Mang's (r. 923 CE) regime, which imposed ultra-modernist policies. After his overthrow, the government of later Han resumed earlier laissez faire policies and relinquished control of these industries to private businessmen.|$|R

50|$|The South Carolina Dispensary {{system was}} a state-run <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>liquor</b> {{sales in the}} United States state of South Carolina which {{operated}} from 1893 to 1907 statewide and until 1916 in some counties. The system {{was the brainchild of}} Governor Benjamin Tillman, a farmer from Edgefield known as “Pitchfork Ben,” who served as governor from 1890-1894 and as a U.S. Senator from 1895 until his death in 1918. This interesting experiment had never before been tried at the state level, and proved to be the last time a state would require all liquor sold within its borders to be bottled and dispensed through state-run facilities. The South Carolina Dispensary system {{came to be known as}} “Ben Tillman’s Baby”.|$|R
500|$|Though {{requiring}} {{additional revenue}} {{to fund the}} Han–Xiongnu War, the government during Emperor Wu of Han's reign (141–87 BC) sought to avoid heavy taxation of small landowners. To increase revenue, the government imposed heavier taxes on merchants, confiscated land from nobles, sold offices and titles, and established government monopolies over the minting of coins, iron manufacture and salt mining. New taxes were imposed on the ownership of boats, carts, carriages, wheelbarrows, shops and other properties. The overall property tax for merchants was raised in 119 BC from 120 coins for every 10,000 coins-worth of property owned to 120 coins for every 2,000 coins-worth of property owned. Tax rates for almost all commodities are unknown, except for that of liquor. After the government <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>liquor</b> was abolished in 81 BC, a property tax of 2 coins for every [...] was levied <b>on</b> <b>liquor</b> merchants.|$|R

50|$|Under the {{influence}} of James Menzies, Southland Province (a {{small part of the}} present Region, centred on Invercargill) seceded from Otago in 1861 following the escalation of political tensions. However, rising debt forced Southland to rejoin Otago in 1870 and the provincial system, and with it the province of Otago, was abolished entirely in 1876. This debt was caused by a population decline stemming from poor returns from pastoral farming. In 1874, Invercargill's population was less than 2,500 which reflected the drift north to large centres. In the 1880s, the development of an export industry based on butter and cheese encouraged the growth of dairy farming in Southland.In December 1905, Invercargill voted in local prohibition of alcohol sales. This lasted for 40 years until voted out by returning servicemen in the Second World War. Drinking continued meanwhile, thanks to hotels and liquor merchants in outlying districts, huge volumes of beer, often in kegs, brought to private homes, or sold by the glass by keggers at hiding spots round the City.

50|$|However, Senator Glass soon {{criticized the}} New Deal, {{and the new}} Senator Byrd had some early defeats, {{particularly}} as he opposed Roosevelt's repeal of Prohibition in early 1933. Moreover, Virginia's tax revenues were much lower than expected, so as May 1933 ended Gov. Pollard announced another 5% salary cut for state employees and proposed a 30% reduction in department appropriations (Virginia's $560,000 surplus as the 2-year budget cycle began had become a deficit of $619,000 despite cutting appropriations by $3 million). The additional cuts produced outcries ranging from legislators to the State Corporation Commission to the Education Superintendent. A cartoon in the Richmond Times-Dispatch portrayed Gov. Pollard as Horatio defending a bridge against wet forces. When Byrd sent his lieutenant, state Senator William M. Tuck of Halifax, to the Governor to call a special legislative session to legalize beer and make it taxable (a penny per bottle), Governor Pollard (despite his long advocacy of prohibition) called the special legislative session and resulting constitutional convention, which promptly ratified the 21st Amendment. The General Assembly of 1934 then established a state <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>liquor</b> sales. The state legislature also passed measures implementing the National Recovery Administration, despite the criticism by Senator Carter Glass and 4th district Congressman Patrick Henry Drewry, but its operation proved rocky, and few Virginians mourned its demise at the pen of the U.S. Supreme Court in May 1935, well after Pollard's term ended.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the term}} rượu đế is used {{most often in}} {{southern}} Vietnam, such liquor is typically called rượu quốc lủi in northern Vietnam. Although the exact etymology of the latter term is unclear, its component words translate literally as follows: rượu=liquor; quốc=nation, state; and lủi=to slip away. There are several theories {{of the origin of}} this term. The first proposes that it is a corruption of rượu cuốc lủi (literally [...] "swamphen slips away liquor"), as cuốc (Porphyrio, a type of swamphen) and quốc are homophones; this term may have come about because those who produce and sell this form of liquor {{have to do it in}} fear of prosecution, selling and then slipping away, like the behavior of the cuốc bird. The second theory is that the term is a parody of the foreign term [...] "national spirit" [...] (literally translated as quốc hồn quốc túy, but can be understood to refer to a type of liquor), because the [...] "national spirit" [...] has to be produced surreptitiously, it is thus called rượu quốc lủi. The third theory states that the term was created to distinguish this liquor from rượu quốc doanh (literally [...] "state enterprise alcohol"); the government in northern Vietnam under communist rule prior to đổi mới in the 1980s had a <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>liquor</b> production, so this illegally produced alcohol is similar to American moonshine—again highlighting the theme of secrecy.|$|R

40|$|This thesis was {{completed}} at the Washington State University Honors College. It received a ranking of "passed with distinction. "In November 2011, Washington state voters passed Ballot Measure Initiative No. 1183, effectively ending the state’s 78 -year-old <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>liquor</b> sales. Taking effect in June of 2012, privatization permitted {{the sale of}} hard liquor in over 1, 600 stores and specialty shops, closing the roughly 350 state-owned or state-contracted locations. Initiative 1183 provided consumers the ability to purchase hard alcohol in grocery stores with virtually no time constraints on when it could be purchased. Although convenient, the addition of fees at the distribution and retail levels contributed to {{a substantial increase in}} the total cost to purchase, as opposed to the assumption of a price decrease commonly associated with the transition from a monopoly provider to a competitive market. While existing scholarly literature on general alcohol consumption and underage drinking is abundant, there are few cases linking college student consumption in privatized states to that of public monopolies. No studies were found on states transitioning from a public monopoly to a privatized system and its effects on infractions committed while under the influence. This study determines whether alcohol privatization affected the number of alcohol related citations, violations, and/or arrests by students at the Pullman campus of Washington State University, a college town situated in a state where price increased and the close proximity of low-priced alternatives exists in the adjacent state still under a public monopoly.

50|$|As Sweden was industrialized and {{urbanized}} {{during the}} 19th century, industrially produced brännvin became more available, and alcohol caused increasing {{health and social}} problems. The temperance movement rose, and since 1905, government has had a <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> sales of <b>liquor.</b> The Swedish prohibition referendum in 1922 resulted in continued sales of alcohol. A rationing system, called Brattsystemet or motbok, was used until 1955. As Sweden entered the EU in 1995, drinking habits became more continental, and regulations were relaxed. Systembolaget introduced box wine and law allowed private enterprises to produce, import and market alcohol, and sell directly to restaurants—though the retail monopoly remained. Consumption of alcohol increased by 30% from 1995 to 2005.|$|R
