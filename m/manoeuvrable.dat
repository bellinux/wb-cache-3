5|$|In 1914, {{the crew}} {{numbered}} 803 officers and enlisted men. The Swiftsures were quite <b>manoeuvrable</b> {{as a result}} of their balanced rudder and a hull form optimized to make the rudder more effective. They were the last British battleships to enter service with bow crests and were also were the last to enter service equipped with ventilation cowls.|$|E
5|$|Although the British {{ships were}} {{substantially}} larger than any individual French vessel, the frigates were more numerous and more <b>manoeuvrable.</b> Neither side {{could afford to}} take significant damage in the battle, so each sought to drive the other off rather than achieve an outright victory. On 9 September Sercey's frigates formed a line of battle, successfully engaging first Arrogant and then Victorious and inflicting damage on each while preventing them from supporting one another. The French frigates, particularly Vertu and Seine, also suffered and by late morning both sides disengaged, the British retiring to Madras for repairs while Sercey anchored at King's Island in the Mergui Archipelago, eventually sheltering in Batavia.|$|E
5|$|It was {{designed}} to replace the galleys {{that made up the}} core of the fleets that operated along the coasts and in the archipelagos of the Baltic Sea. The turuma had a bigger draft, was somewhat slower under oars, but offered superior accommodation for its crew, was more seaworthy and had roughly ten times the number of heavy guns. It could be propelled with either sails or oars and was both smaller and more <b>manoeuvrable</b> than most sailing warships which made it suitable for operations in shallow, confined waters.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{specialized}} archipelago vessels, the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses. Although it had superior firepower relative to galleys, its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly <b>manoeuvrable</b> under oars, {{it was still}} difficult to propel while rowed. A hemmema {{had the potential to}} be an effective weapon against galleys, matching their forward firepower and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament. Inside an enemy galley formation, it could wreak considerable havoc, but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle, leaving that tactical role untested.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{weaponry}} {{and tactics}} differed greatly {{from that of}} the indigenous peoples. This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets, arquebuses and cannon), war dogs and war horses. Horses had never been encountered by the Maya before, and their use gave the mounted conquistador an overwhelming advantage over his unmounted opponent, allowing the rider to strike with greater force while simultaneously making him less vulnerable to attack. The mounted conquistador was highly <b>manoeuvrable</b> and this allowed groups of combatants to quickly displace themselves across the battlefield. The horse itself was not passive, and could buffet the enemy combatant.|$|E
5|$|The Aire and Calder {{was built}} for {{commercial}} freight, and although the volume carried has dropped significantly, particularly since coal deliveries to Ferrybridge power station by canal stopped, the navigation still carried 300,000 tonnes of freight in 2007, down from 1.64 million tonnes in 2000. The Leeds to Castleford section {{and much of the}} Wakefield branch are now mainly used as leisure routes, but below Castleford, the industrial nature of the waterway is more obvious, and pleasure boats must give way to commercial vessels. 600 tonne vessels, designed to make maximum use of the locks, produce considerable wash, and are not as <b>manoeuvrable</b> as a narrow boat.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{lasted for}} more than 15 hours, in an increasing gale and the constant presence of the rocky Breton coast. The seas were so rough that the French ship was unable to open the lower gun ports during the action {{and as a result}} could only fire the upper deck guns, significantly reducing the advantage that a ship of the line would normally have over the smaller frigates. The damage the more <b>manoeuvrable</b> British vessels inflicted on the French ship was so severe that as the winds increased, the French crew lost control and the Droits de l'Homme was swept onto a sandbar and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The third {{prototype}} {{made its}} maiden flight in early 1948, but {{the pace of}} the flight testing was leisurely with only 7 hours and 40 minutes completed by 30 November, over half of which were connected with air show performances. Testing concluded in March 1949 when the officer in charge concluded that there was no further purpose to the tests. While the Firecrest was faster than the Firebrand, and gave its pilot a much better view from the cockpit, it was otherwise disappointing, with test pilot and naval aviator Captain Eric Brown claiming that the Firecrest was even less <b>manoeuvrable</b> than the sluggish Firebrand, while the powered ailerons gave lumpy controls, leading to instability in turbulent air.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} mammals, and unlike in birds, the radius {{is the main}} {{component}} of the forearm. Bats have five elongated digits, which all radiate around the wrist. The thumb points forward and supports the leading edge, and the other digits support the tension held in the wing membrane. The second and third digits go along the wing tip, allowing the wing to be pulled forward against a strong drag force, without having to be thick like they were in pterosaur wings. The fourth and fifth digits go from the wrist to the trailing edge, and repel the bending force caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane. Due to their flexible joints, bats are more <b>manoeuvrable</b> and more dextrous than gliding mammals.|$|E
5|$|Both sides had {{suffered}} severe damage and casualties, but both were also {{aware that the}} battle would inevitably be rejoined and so {{the aftermath of the}} British defeat was one of frenzied activity at Gibraltar, Algeciras and Cadiz. While the British and French squadrons conducted hasty repairs, the French and Spanish fleet at Cadiz was prepared for a rescue mission, a heavy squadron arriving at Algeciras on 12 July. As the squadron departed with Linois's squadron, it was attacked again by Saumarez's squadron at the Second Battle of Algeciras and caught at night by faster and more <b>manoeuvrable</b> ships, which resulted in the British inflicting heavy losses on the Spanish rearguard but failing to destroy the French squadron for a second time.|$|E
5|$|For the battle, Rotmistrov {{ordered his}} tanks {{to move forward}} at high speed to engage the German armour in order to nullify the {{advantages}} the Tiger tanks had in the range and firepower of their 88mm guns. He believed the more <b>manoeuvrable</b> T-34 medium tanks {{would be able to}} quickly close in and obtain effective flanking shots against the German heavy tanks. In fact, Soviet intelligence had greatly overestimated the numbers of Ferdinands and Tigers possessed by the II SS-Panzer Corps. In actuality there were no Ferdinands with the 4th Panzer Army or Army Group South, as they were all deployed on the northern side of the Kursk salient with the 9th Army. Soviet tank-crews frequently mistook the versions of Panzer IV tanks that were armed with the KwK 40 anti-tank gun, which also had extra armour added to their turret, for Tigers; therefore Soviet reports tended to overestimate the number of Tigers employed by the German side during the Battle of Kursk.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the Columbidae {{tend to have}} short legs, short {{bills with}} a fleshy cere, and small heads on large, compact bodies. In a series of {{experiments}} in 1975 by Dr.Mark B. Friedman, using doves, their characteristic head bobbing was shown {{to be due to}} their natural desire to keep their vision constant. It was shown yet again in a 1978 experiment by Dr.Barrie J. Frost, in which pigeons were placed on treadmills; it was observed that they did not bob their heads, as their surroundings were constant. The wings are large, and have eleven primary feathers, and low wing loading; pigeons have strong wing muscles (wing muscles comprise 31–44% of their body weight) and are among the strongest fliers of all birds. They are also highly <b>manoeuvrable</b> in flight.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 31 May 1809 was a naval {{skirmish}} in the Bay of Bengal {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars. During the action, an Honourable East India Company convoy carrying goods worth over £500,000 was attacked and partially {{captured by the}} French frigate Caroline. The three East Indiamen {{that made up the}} convoy fought against their opponent with their own batteries of cannon but ultimately were less powerful, less <b>manoeuvrable</b> and less trained than their opponent and were defeated one by one; only the smallest of the three escaped. The action was the first in a string of attacks on important convoys in the Indian Ocean by French cruisers operating from Île de France and Île Bonaparte during a concerted campaign against British shipping in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} {{engagement of}} the battle was contested initially {{within sight of the}} other combatants, Persanne firing the first shots at the pursuing Unite at 12:30. The smaller size of these vessels made them faster and more <b>manoeuvrable</b> than their larger counterparts, and as a result it was not until 16:00 that Unite caught the smaller ship. During the pursuit, the ships had exchanged long-range shots from their stern and bow guns which caused six casualties aboard Unite but none on Persanne. From external appearances, Persanne seemed to be a frigate of similar size to the fifth rate Unite, but in fact the French ship was only lightly armed, carrying 26 small guns to her opponent's 36. As a result, {{when it became clear that}} his ship could not outrun Unite, Captain Satie surrendered after firing a token broadside rather than be destroyed by the more powerful ship.|$|E
5|$|This idea {{remained}} with Nansen during following years. After his triumphant return from Greenland {{he began to}} develop a detailed plan for a polar venture, which he made public in February 1890 {{at a meeting of}} the recently formed Norwegian Geographical Society. Previous expeditions, he argued, had approached the North Pole from the west, and had failed because they were working against the prevailing east-west current. The secret of success was to work with this current. A workable plan, Nansen said, would require a small, strong and <b>manoeuvrable</b> ship capable of carrying fuel and provisions for twelve men for five years. The ship would sail to the approximate location of Jeannette's sinking, and would enter the ice. It would then drift west with the current towards the pole and beyond it, eventually reaching the sea between Greenland and Spitsbergen.|$|E
5|$|When {{they entered}} service, the IK-3s {{suffered}} from minor equipment and instrument faults, largely caused by {{deficiencies in the}} Yugoslav aeronautical industry which had resulted {{in a mixture of}} foreign and Yugoslav-made instruments being fitted to the aircraft. The Yugoslav Minister of War approved the acquisition of a further 48 IK-3s to be delivered in 1941–42. The operational aircraft were allocated to the 51st Independent Fighter Group at Zemun, six each to the 161st Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Savo Poljanec) and the 162nd Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Todor Gogić). The IK-3 was then tested against Yugoslav Messerschmitt Bf 109Es in mock dogfights. The evaluation concluded that the IK-3 had several advantages over the Bf 109E; the Yugoslav aircraft was more <b>manoeuvrable</b> in level flight, enabling it to quickly get behind a pursuing Bf 109E by making tight horizontal turns.|$|E
5|$|After {{fifteen minutes}} of combat, Boston lost its cross-jack yard and by 05:45 had {{suffered}} significant damage to its rigging and sails, rendering the ship significantly less <b>manoeuvrable</b> than Embuscade. At 06:10 the main topmast was knocked over and the mizzen mast badly damaged, and ten minutes later, as he was exhorting his men to greater efforts, a cannonball struck the rail where Captain Courtenay and Royal Marine Lieutenant James Butler were standing. Butler was killed instantly and Courtenay fell to the deck unresponsive, possibly killed. Believing his commander to be dead, Lieutenant John Edwards assumed command and had the bodies thrown overboard {{in an effort to}} prevent his sailors losing morale from the death of their captain. Boston continued to suffer under the heavier guns of the French ship and by 06:40 the mizzen mast was close to collapse and much of the remaining rigging had been shot away. Casualties mounted, with Lieutenant Edwards and Lieutenant Alexander Kerr both badly wounded, the latter blinded in one eye and the former struck on the head and briefly rendered unconscious.|$|E
5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, Furieuse disappeared ahead, Mounsey pursuing in {{the hope}} of rediscovering his opponent during the night. At 03:00 on 6 July, the British lookouts spotted the French ship in the distance and the chase began again, Bonne Citoyenne proving much faster than the French ship as the wind strengthened. At 09:10 it became clear to Kerdaniel that he could not escape his opponent and instead turned to meet her, opening fire five minutes later as Bonne Citoyenne came within range. Mounsey replied immediately, the two ships exchanging fire at close range for nearly seven hours, the smaller and more <b>manoeuvrable</b> Bonne Citoyenne successfully turning several times to vary her broadsides and prevent her guns overheating. In the exchange, the British ship fired 129 broadsides, while Furieuse only managed 70: Bonne Citoyenne lost three cannon to fractures caused by the intense heat generated by repeated firing. With his ammunition spent, Mounsey swung towards Furieuse at 18:16 to board and capture her, at which point Kerdaniel, whose ship was battered and unmanoeuvrable, surrendered.|$|E
5|$|By 08:00, it {{was clear}} that despite his vessels speed, Stewart's plan was going to fail: the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom had not even {{attempted}} to join his advance, deliberately checking their advance towards the French, falling far behind Windham. Although Stewart now faced overwhelming odds, he had no option but to continue the attack: his ship was now too close to attempt to flee from the French frigate. Captain Dornal de Guy opened fire at 09:30, his shot repeatedly striking Windham as she approached. Stewart did not return fire, instead waiting until his ship was closer to minimise the inaccuracy of his gunnery. Unable to reach the more nimble French ship directly, Stewart absorbed the French fire until he was as close as he was able before unleashing his guns. The results were disappointing: the entire broadside splashed into the sea far short of the French ship. The more <b>manoeuvrable</b> Manche now approached Windham at close range, and the two ships fired at one another for over an hour, Stewart still unsupported by his companions, who did no more than fire the occasional ineffective shot at extreme range.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{behaviour}} of the dodo, as most contemporary descriptions are very brief. Based on weight estimates, {{it has been suggested}} the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the cantilever strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. The legs were robust and strong to support the bulk of the bird, and also made it agile and <b>manoeuvrable</b> in the dense, pre-human landscape. Though the wings were small, well-developed muscle scars on the bones show that they were not completely vestigial, and may have been used for display behaviour and balance; extant pigeons also use their wings for such purposes. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, {{there is no evidence that}} the dodo used its wings in intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius receives more rainfall and has less seasonal variation than Rodrigues, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the dodo would have less reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. The Rodrigues solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.|$|E
5|$|No.1 Squadron re-equipped with Canberra Mk.20s after {{returning}} to Australia. The RAAF's first jet bomber, the Canberra was subsonic but had long range and was highly <b>manoeuvrable.</b> It had been procured partly for its capacity to deliver nuclear weapons, an ordnance option the government seriously contemplated but never acquired. Initially the Canberra's envisaged mission profile was medium-to-high-altitude area bombing but its primitive bombsight and light load made this a dubious proposition, and by mid-1961 crews were training in low-level army cooperation tactics. No.1 Squadron was awarded successive Gloucester Cups for its proficiency in 1959–60 and 1960–61. As of January 1962, its strength was eight aircraft and 53 personnel, including 18 officers. The unit effectively ceased operations in 1968, to begin converting to the General Dynamics F-111C supersonic bomber, which was expected to enter service soon afterwards. Already controversial owing to its escalating cost, the F-111 program was heavily delayed by airworthiness concerns related to its swing-wing technology. In September 1970, as an interim measure while awaiting delivery of the F-111, No.1 Squadron relinquished its Canberras for leased McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantoms, which it operated until June 1973. Although the Phantom had a multi-role capability, the RAAF employed it as a strike aircraft to maintain compatibility with the proposed F-111 mission profile. One of No.1 Squadron's Phantoms was lost with its crew of two in June 1971, the only fatalities and hull loss of the 24 aircraft leased to the RAAF. Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and well regarded by its Australian crews.|$|E
25|$|The {{design has}} been {{described}} as the best sailing boat design ever, for being both high speed, highly <b>manoeuvrable</b> and yet easy to handle by just two crew.|$|E
25|$|The D.I had a {{relatively}} high wing loading for its time, and was not particularly <b>manoeuvrable.</b> This was compensated by its superior speed and firepower and it quickly proved the best all-round fighter available.|$|E
25|$|The Vickers Type 279 Venom was a low-wing {{monoplane}} single-seat, single-engined, eight-gun fighter, {{powered by}} a radial engine. It was fast and <b>manoeuvrable</b> but its engine lacked the power and development potential of its Merlin-powered competitors. Only one was built.|$|E
25|$|The Polish Air Force {{used these}} slow and <b>manoeuvrable</b> {{aircraft}} for air reconnaissance and COIN operations against UPA bands in mountainous area of Bieszczady. Pilots and navigators were dispatched {{to look for}} concentrations of UPA forces and if needed, engage them with machine guns and grenades. On several occasions, the UPA managed to bring {{down some of the}} Po-2s, but never captured or operated them.|$|E
25|$|In fighter technology, the {{performance}} capabilities were closer. The Yak 1 could compete on equal {{terms with the}} Bf 109E, while the LaGG-3 and MiG-3 were slower and less <b>manoeuvrable.</b> The Bf 109F held a significant flight performance advantage over Soviet fighters. In manoeuvrability terms, the Polikarpov I-153 and Polikarpov I-15 could outturn the Bf 109, while the Soviets had more experience {{in the use of}} air-to-air rockets.|$|E
25|$|It was {{considered}} to be sturdy and very <b>manoeuvrable</b> for a glider. The design of the Horsa adopted a high-wing cantilever monoplane configuration, being equipped with wooden wings and a wooden semi-monocoque fuselage. The fuselage was built in three sections bolted together, the front section held the pilot's compartment and main freight loading door, the middle section was accommodation for troops or freight, the rear section supported the tail unit.|$|E
25|$|The {{company was}} aiming to {{manufacture}} the new Vespa in large numbers, and their longstanding industrial experience {{led to an}} efficient Ford-style volume production line. The scooter {{was presented to the}} press at Rome Golf Club, where journalists were apparently mystified by the strange, pastel coloured, toy-like object on display. However, the road tests were encouraging, and even with no rear suspension the machine was more <b>manoeuvrable</b> and comfortable to ride than a traditional motorcycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} two prototypes flew in July 1927, being the first Japanese {{designed}} carrier-based fighter to fly, with the second following in September. It was not successful, with the design proposed by Nakajima, {{a modified version of}} the British Gloster Gamecock fighter being chosen for production as the Nakajima A1N, despite the fact that Nakajima and Gloster had chosen to ignore the requirement for easy ditching, allowing a lighter and more <b>manoeuvrable</b> aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Single-Coach Type – This is {{the latest}} new rolling stock, one {{of which has been}} running since 24 December 2012. These trams are claimed to be faster and more <b>manoeuvrable</b> than the current double-coach trams with the {{carriage}} being longer than the carriages in the double-coach trams. There are now plans to introduce more single-coach trams across the city, including air-conditioned coaches, possibly replacing the double-coach trams with the single-coach and reopening some closed tram routes.|$|E
25|$|The E.F.B.8 flew in November 1915, demonstrating good performance, {{being the}} fastest twin-engined {{aircraft}} of 1915, {{although not as}} good a performance as expected. It was not considered <b>manoeuvrable</b> enough {{for use as a}} fighter, and with the prospect of better-performing single-engined fighters with synchronised guns, was rejected for production. The experience designing it proved useful to Pierson, however, when two years later, he came to develop the Vickers Vimy bomber, which was much larger but of similar layout.|$|E
25|$|She {{was built}} by Vosper Thornycroft, in Woolston, Hampshire, and {{commissioned}} in 1999. The class was originally named as the Single Role Minehunter and was planned to complement {{the capabilities of the}} preceding Hunt class and to be cheaper to build. Sandown-class MCMVs are highly <b>manoeuvrable</b> vessels due to being fitted with Voith-Schneider propulsors allowing rapid turning at slow speeds or whilst stationary. They are considered to be amongst the best active minehunters in the world.|$|E
25|$|Bornholm {{has also}} become an internationally {{recognised}} venue for 'match racing', a sailing sport where two identical (or one design) supplied racing yachts are raced in one-on-one dogfights on the water. The Danish Open event was held in Bornholm in September 2010 at the port town of Rønne on the Western coast of Bornholm. The racing yachts used for the Danish Open event are Danish-designed DS37 racing yachts. These highly <b>manoeuvrable</b> and versatile boats are also used in the Match Cup Sweden event.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, the Imperial German Navy placed {{orders for}} a {{flotilla}} of 12 torpedo boats {{as part of}} its shipbuilding programme for that year, with one half flotilla of six ordered from AG Vulcan, and six from Germaniawerft. The 1911 torpedo boats were smaller than those ordered in recent years in order to be more <b>manoeuvrable</b> and so work better with the fleet, which resulted in the numbering series for torpedo boats being restarted. The reduction in size resulted in the ships' seaworthiness being adversely affected.|$|E
25|$|The gulls are generalist feeders. Indeed, {{they are}} the least {{specialised}} of all the seabirds, and their morphology allows for equal adeptness in swimming, flying, and walking. They are more adept walking on land than most other seabirds, and the smaller gulls {{tend to be more}} <b>manoeuvrable</b> while walking. The walking gait of gulls includes a slight side to side motion, something that can be exaggerated in breeding displays. In the air, they are able to hover and they are also able to take off quickly with little space.|$|E
25|$|At 20:00 Tuesday, AS-34 was {{launched}} again but was damaged when it struck a boom {{as it was}} being lowered into the sea. It was brought back aboard, repaired, and relaunched at 21:10. On Tuesday, 15 August, {{three days after the}} sinking, the crane ship PK-7500 arrived with the more <b>manoeuvrable</b> Project 18270 Bester-type DSRV (AC-36). But the weather prevented the PK-7500 from launching the DSRV, and the rescue team decided to launch the submersible near the coast and tow it to the rescue site with a salvage tug.|$|E
