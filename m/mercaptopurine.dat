25|$|<b>Mercaptopurine</b> is a {{cytostatic}} {{drug that}} is an antimetabolite. The <b>mercaptopurine</b> molecule mimics purine, which {{is necessary for the}} synthesis of DNA. With <b>mercaptopurine</b> present, cells are not able to make DNA, and cell division is inhibited.|$|E
25|$|In {{administering}} <b>mercaptopurine</b> it {{is necessary}} to monitor the levels of <b>mercaptopurine</b> metabolites in the blood to establish the correct dosage for a patient. An initial concern is hepatotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mercaptopurine,</b> {{also known}} as 6-Mercaptopurine, 6-MP and Purinethiol.|$|E
40|$|Tumor and proliferating cells {{maintain}} a high glycolytic rate even under aerobic conditions. The discovery of fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate, a potent stimulator of glycolysis, has prompted a re-investigation of this phenomenon. Rat hepatoma cells and fibroblasts stimulated by mitogens or {{transformed by the}} Rous sarcoma virus carrying the v-src oncogene were used as models. The results indicate that in established lines of hepatoma cells the biochemical properties of the bifunctional enzyme, PFK- 2 /FBPase- 2, involved in the synthesis and degradation of fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate, {{differ from those of}} the enzyme from normal liver. In addition, the stimulation of glycolysis induced by phorbol esters and pp 60 v-src can be explained by an increase in the concentration of fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate and an activation of PFK- 2. The mechanism of stimulation involves the transcription of a gene whose product activates PFK- 2 or is a distinct PFK- 2 isozyme. Finally, <b>mercaptopurines</b> were found to block fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate synthesis in vitro and in lymphocytes and lymphoblastic cells. In these cells, this resulted in an inhibition of glycolysis...|$|R
40|$|Phleomycin (≤ 2 μg/ml) induces neither {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA) {{breakdown}} nor cell death in stationary-phase Escherichia coli B cells, but {{the addition of}} 8 mm caffeine immediately initiates these changes {{in the same way}} as increasing the phleomycin concentration 10 -fold. This phenomenon is termed “amplification” (6). Pyronin Y, a number of nontoxic thio- and <b>mercaptopurines</b> (of which the most active were 6, 7 - and 6, 9 -dimethyl- 2 -methylthiopurine), and coumarin have been found to be considerably more efficient amplifiers of phleomycin activity than caffeine. Thus 2 mm 6, 7 - and 6, 9 -dimethyl- 2 -methylthiopurine, 0. 16 mm pyronin, and 4 mm coumarin killed 10 to 100 times more phleomycin-treated bacteria within 2 hr than 8 mm caffeine. As with caffeine, amplification of cell death by these compounds was accompanied by degradation of DNA to acid-soluble fragments. A number of compounds including 2, 6 -dichloropurine, 6 -hydroxy- 2 -methylthiopurine, α-naphthol, β-naphthol, naphthionic acid, and α-naphthol- 4, 8 -disulphonic acid inhibited the action of phleomycin, if they were present in the cell suspension during phleomycin treatment, but some caused amplification if added subsequent to the phleomycin. Although no mutants resistant to ≥ 10 μg of phleomycin per ml were observed among 1011 E. coli B cells screened, such mutants occurred with a frequency of 10 − 6 to 10 − 7 among cultures resistant to 1 to 2 μg of phleomycin per ml. These double mutants were cross-resistant to phleomycin plus caffeine. The amplifying compounds, though structurally dissimilar, shared the common characteristic of binding selectively to denatured DNA as measured by equilibrium dialysis methods. The implications of these observations in supporting a model of phleomycin amplification proposed previously (6) and their utility in providing a logic for developing a new class of antibiotics are discussed...|$|R
25|$|Frequent {{blood cell}} counts are also {{recommended}} during administration of <b>mercaptopurine.</b> The drug may be toxic to bone marrow, where many blood components are made. If {{there is an}} abnormally large drop in white blood cell count, or any blood cell count, administration of the drug should be halted at least temporarily.|$|E
25|$|Imidazole {{has become}} an {{important}} part of many pharmaceuticals. Synthetic imidazoles are present in many fungicides and antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antihypertensive medications. Imidazole is part of the theophylline molecule, found in tea leaves and coffee beans, that stimulates the central nervous system. It is present in the anticancer medication <b>mercaptopurine,</b> which combats leukemia by interfering with DNA activities.|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} {{chemotherapy}} are gonadotoxic and may cause infertility. Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating {{drugs such as}} cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil, and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, <b>mercaptopurine,</b> and 5-fluorouracil.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine {{can cause}} birth defects. A 2003 {{population-based}} study in Denmark {{showed that the}} use of azathioprine and related <b>mercaptopurine</b> resulted in a seven-fold incidence of fetal abnormalities as well as a 20-fold increase in miscarriage. Birth defects in a child whose father was taking azathioprine have also been reported. Although no adequate and well-controlled studies have taken place in humans, when given to animals in doses equivalent to human dosages, teratogenesis was observed. Transplant patients already on this drug should not discontinue on becoming pregnant. This contrasts with the later-developed drugs tacrolimus and mycophenolate, which are contraindicated during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and <b>mercaptopurine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Drugs: diuretics (e.g., thiazides, furosemide), gliptins (e.g., vildagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin), tetracycline, sulfonamides, estrogens, {{azathioprine}} and <b>mercaptopurine,</b> pentamidine, salicylates, steroids, Depakote ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{therapeutic}} {{drugs can}} provoke pellagra. [...] These include the antibiotics isoniazid, which decreases available B6 by binding {{to it and}} making it inactive, so it cannot be used in niacin synthesis, and chloramphenicol; the anti-cancer agent fluorouracil; and the immunosuppressant <b>mercaptopurine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Mercaptopurine</b> {{inhibits}} {{the production}} of white blood cells generally. Because this makes the body more susceptible to infection, patients need to watch for infections. Vaccinations are critically important, particularly the yearly flu shot and periodic pneumonia immunizations. [...] Vaccine response is best if given prior to initiation of immunosuppressive medications, and patients on immunosuppressives should also be should use caution when receiving vaccines containing live virus.|$|E
50|$|Animal tumors {{that are}} {{resistant}} to <b>mercaptopurine</b> often have {{lost the ability to}} convert <b>mercaptopurine</b> to TIMP. However, it is clear that resistance to <b>mercaptopurine</b> may be acquired by other means as well, particularly in human leukemias.|$|E

50|$|Azathioprine (Prometheus' Imuran), is {{the main}} {{immunosuppressive}} cytotoxic substance. It is extensively used to control transplant rejection reactions.

5000|$|This {{drug was}} {{formerly}} not recommended during pregnancy and early evidence indicated pregnant {{women on the}} drug (or the related azathioprine) showed a seven-fold incidence of fetal abnormalities {{as well as a}} 20-fold increase in miscarriage. There were also anecdotal reports linking <b>mercaptopurine</b> with spontaneous abortion, leading to the US FDA rating both AZA and <b>mercaptopurine</b> as category D drugs. However, Davis et al. 1999 found <b>mercaptopurine,</b> compared to methotrexate, was ineffective as a single-agent abortifacient; every woman in the <b>mercaptopurine</b> arm of the study had fetal cardiac activity at follow-up (two weeks later) and was given a suction abortion. A more recent, larger study, however, performed by the Cancers et Surrisque Associe aux Maladies inflamatoires intestinales En France (CESAME) indicated an overall rate of congenital malformations not significantly greater than the general population in France. The European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) concluded in a consensus paper in 2010 that while AZA and <b>mercaptopurine</b> have an FDA rating of D, new research in both animals and humans indicates that [...] "thiopurines are safe and well tolerated during pregnancy." ...|$|E

50|$|The enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is responsible, in part, for the {{inactivation}} of 6-mercaptopurine. TPMT catalyzes the methylation of 6-mercaptopurine {{into the}} inactive metabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine - this methylation prevents <b>mercaptopurine</b> from further conversion into active, cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. Certain genetic variations within the TPMT gene {{can lead to}} decreased or absent TPMT enzyme activity, and individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for these types of genetic variations may have increased levels of TGN metabolites and {{an increased risk of}} severe bone marrow suppression (myelosuppression) when receiving <b>mercaptopurine.</b> In many ethnicities, TPMT polymorphisms that result in decreased or absent TPMT activity occur with a frequency of approximately 5%, meaning that about 0.25% of people are homozygous for these variants. However, an assay of TPMT activity in red blood cells or a TPMT genetic test can identify peoplewith reduced TPMT activity, allowing for the adjustment of <b>mercaptopurine</b> dose or avoidance of the drug entirely. The FDA-approved drug label for <b>mercaptopurine</b> recommends testing for TPMT activity to identify people at risk for myelotoxicity. Indeed, testing for TPMT activity is currently one of the few examples of pharmacogenetics being translated into routine clinical care.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>mercaptopurine</b> is {{converted}} to nucleotide derivatives of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) by the sequential actions of inosinate (IMP) dehydrogenase and xanthylate (XMP) aminase, converting TIMP to thioguanylic acid (TGMP).|$|E
5000|$|Allopurinol {{was first}} {{synthesized}} and reported in 1956 by Roland K. Robins (1926-1992), {{in a search}} for antineoplastic agents.
