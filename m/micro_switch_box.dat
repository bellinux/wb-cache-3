40|$|Abstract–An FPGA <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> {{is said to}} be hyper-universal if it is routable for all {{possible}} surrounding multi-pin net topolo-gies satisfying the routing resource constraints. It is desirable to design hyper-universal <b>switch</b> <b>boxes</b> with the minimum number of switches. A previous work, Universal Switch Module, consid-ered such a design problem concerning-pin net routings around a single FPGA <b>switch</b> <b>box.</b> However, as most nets are multi-pin nets in practice, it is imperative to study the problem that involves multi-pin nets. In this paper, we provide a new view of global routings and formulate the most general-sided <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> de-sign problem into an optimum-partite graph design problem. Applying a powerful decomposition theorem of global routings, we prove that, for a fixed, the number of switches in an opti-mum-sided <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> with terminals on each side is, by constructing some hyper-universal <b>switch</b> <b>boxes</b> with <b>switches.</b> Furthermore, we obtain optimum, hyper-universal-sided and-sided <b>switch</b> <b>boxes,</b> and propose hyper-universal-sided <b>switch</b> <b>boxes</b> with less than switches, which is very close to the lower bound obtained for pure 2 -pin net models in [5]. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper explores {{theories}} on designing optimal multipoint interconnection structures, and proposes a simple <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> design scheme {{which can be}} directly applied to field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> designs, and communication switching network designs. We present a new hyperuniversal <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> designs with four sides and terminals on each side, which is routable for every multipin net-routing requirement. This new design is proved to be optimum for a I FFF S and close to optimum for T with T &quot;Q switches. We also give a formal analysis and extensive benchmark experiments on routability comparisons between today’s most well-known FPGA <b>switch</b> <b>boxes</b> like disjoint <b>switch</b> blocks (Xilinx XC 4000 Type), Wilton’s switch blocks, Universal switch blocks, and our Hyperuniversal <b>switch</b> <b>boxes.</b> We apply the design scheme to rearrangeable switching network designs targeting for applications of connecting multiple terminals (e. g., teleconferencing). Simply using a-sided hyperuniversal switch block with a crossbar attached to each side, one can build a three-stage one-sided polygonal switching network capable of realizing every multipoint connection requirement on terminals. Besides, due to the fine-grained decomposition property of our design scheme, the new <b>switch</b> <b>box</b> designs are highly scalable and simple on physical layout and routing algorithm implementations.

50|$|<b>Micro</b> <b>switches</b> {{are very}} widely used; among their {{applications}} are appliances, machinery, industrial controls, vehicles, convertible tops {{and many other}} places for control of electrical circuits. They are usually rated to carry current in control circuits only, although some switches can be directly used to control small motors, solenoids, lamps, or other devices. Special low-force versions can sense coins in vending machines, or with a vane attached, air flow. <b>Micro</b> <b>switches</b> may be directly operated by a mechanism, or may be packaged {{as part of a}} pressure, flow, or temperature switch, operated by a sensing mechanism such as a Bourdon tube.

A motor driven cam (usually relatively slow-speed) and one or more <b>micro</b> <b>switches</b> form a timer mechanism. The snap-switch mechanism can be enclosed in a metal housing including actuating levers, plungers or rollers, forming a limit switch useful for control of machine tools or electrically-driven machinery.|$|R
