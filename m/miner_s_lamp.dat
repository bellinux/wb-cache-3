In the present study, we developed a Smart Laboratory system using Raspberry Pi 2, in which the lamps and air-conditioning (AC) are as its object.

To work the system in this study is based on the time delay control is based on two types of connection, i. e., Wi-Fi (1 st scenario) and PLC adapter (2 nd scenario).

The applied fatigue model is based on established methods and is incorporated in an iterative numerical design tool for realistic wind turbine blades. All aerodynamic and structural design properties are available in literature. The software tool FAST is used for advanced aero-servo-elastic load calculations and stress-histories are calculated with elementary beam theory. According to wind energy design standards, a turbulent wind load case is implemented. Fatigue loads are estimated based on 100 % availability and a site-specific annual wind distribution. Rainflow cycle counting and <b>Miner</b> <b>s</b> sum for cumulative damage prediction is used together with constant life diagrams tailored to actual material S-N data. Material properties are based on 95 % survival probability, 95 % confidence level, and additional material safety factors to maintain conservative results. Fatigue performance is first evaluated for the baseline blade design of the 10 MW NOWITECH reference wind turbine. Results show that blade damage is dominated by tensile stresses due to poorer tensile fatigue characteristics of the shell glass fiber material. The interaction between turbulent wind and gravitational fluctuations is demonstrated to greatly influence the damage. The need for relevant S-N data to closely predict such blade stress cycle events is investigated to avoid non-conservative conclusions. State-of-art wind turbine blade trends are discussed and different designs of the NOWITECH baseline blade are analyzed in a parametric study focusing on fatigue performance and material costs...|$|R

Secondly, some of these characteristics interact with the operating life of the cap <b>lamp</b> <b>s</b> battery power, such that differences between LED and incandescent sources can be magnified {{toward the end of}} a 10 hour battery discharge cycle. Empirically, we have determined that after 8 hours at an ambient temperature of 25 C, the average light output of an incandescent cap lamp can decrease to about 69 % of its initial value when powered by a lead-acid battery and it can decrease to about 65 % of its initial value when powered by a nickel-hydride battery. An LED-based cap lamp using a constant current drive circuit can maintain about 96 % of its initial value when powered by a nickel-hydride battery. Real-world tests addressing the effects of ambient temperature and airflow on the light output of an LED and incandescent cap lamp were conducted in the NIOSH Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM). The LED cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance improvement of approximately 9. 5 % and the INC cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance degradation o f approximately 4 %. The differences between LED and incandescent cap lamps were further quantified by the calculation of mesopic luminance data that indicated for the same photopic luminance (i. e., as measured using a conventional light meter) the LED cap lamp could be up to 38 % more efficient than the incandescent cap lamp with a lead-acid battery {{at the end of the}} 10 -hour driving cycle.

40|$|In 1997, the U. S. {{government}} {{introduced an}} option of having headlamps labeled as visually/optically aimable (VOA). To be so labeled, the vertical gradient {{of the light}} output needs to meet certain minimum requirements. A concern with VOA lamps is that they might provide less light above the horizontal than conventional U. <b>S.</b> <b>lamps,</b> thus reducing the effectiveness of retroreflective signs. This study examined 36 first-generation VOA lamps, to assess the reduction of light above the horizontal. Furthermore, this study addressed the possibility of maintaining the status quo of light for sign visibility, by supplementing light from VOA lamps with light from either parking lamps or an auxiliary lamp mounted just above the driver. A comparison of the first-generation VOA lamps in our sample with marketweighted U. S. low beams from 1997 indicates that, {{on the right side}} of the beam pattern, just above the horizontal, the mean deficit from VOA lamps can reach 1, 400 cd per lamp. Two considerations lead to the conclusion that parking lamps will not be able to make up for this deficit. First, current U. S. requirements limit the output of parking lamps above the horizontal to no more than 125 cd. Second, the retroreflective geometry for parking lamps (i. e., the resultant observation angle) provides either no advantage or only a marginal advantage over headlamps. A lamp mounted on the roof just above the driver would provide a substantial advantage over headlamps in terms of retroreflective geometry, because the observation angles for such a lamp are smaller than for either headlamp. Taking into account this advantage, a single such lamp would need to have a peak intensity between 1, 500 and 2, 000 cd to make up for the deficit created by both VOA headlamps...|$|R

These early novelties were put to practical use in September 1879, when the newly organized California Electric Light Company erected a small steam-powered generating plant in San Francisco to furnish downtown subscribers with arc lighting.

40|$|Negligence is not {{a ground}} of {{liability}} unless it causes injury or damage to some interest which the law recognizes and protects.

The establishment of the requisite causal connection is therefore an element of a plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s cause of action for negligence, to be pleaded and proven by him. And where a cause of action exists, the question of causal connection will determine the scope of liability [...] the extent of the injury or damage for which defendant will have to pay.

40|$|The use of {{electrical}} energy by the customers {{are still not}} optimum, especially in the evening at peak load periodes. One method to reduce the peak load by applying load management on the customer side (demand side management) which include are peak clipping (PC) and strategic conservation (SC). The analysis {{was focused on the}} household load i. e. lamp, television and fan in Pekanbaru. This thesis explores benefit of implementation peak clipping and strategic conservation programs in economic criteria by doing economic calculation at city scale and household appliances. Based on the calculation and analysis, by implementation of peak clipping 2 ̆ 7 s and strategic conservation 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> method on <b>lamps,</b> televisions and fans has the potential to result in economic benefits which in fifteenth year NPV becomes Rp. 188. 675. 730. 000,-.
