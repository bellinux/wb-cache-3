For achieving a rapid electricity access for large geographic regions alternative electrification pathways apart from grid connection {{need to be taken}} into account. Therefore, sophisticated planning tools to determine techno-economic optimized electrification pathways are necessary. Here, an approach for such a tool is presented and combines GIS and energy system simulation tools. The approach is based on the identification of consumer clusters, determination of status of electrification and assignment of a suitable electricity supply option. Three options are taken into account: Grid extension, PV-hybrid <b>mini-grids</b> and solar-home systems (SHS). Within this study we have identified 47, 489 consumer clusters for entire Nigeria and found that 46 % of the people living in these clusters are currently not supplied with electricity. A connection of all customers within a 20 km zone around the existing grid would have the largest impact with delivering electricity to 57. 1 million people. Outside this grid zone, a population of 12. 8 million is most suitably supplied by PV-hybrid <b>mini-grids</b> and 2. 8 million by SHS.

Therefore, the government provided remote and rural areas without access to the grid with Solar Home Systems (SHSs). This study has evaluated whether the SHS has contributed to improved welfare for the users, and in which ways. The success of the fee for service arrangement and electricity demand beyond the given amount from the SHS has also been investigated. Two alternative solutions consisting of two <b>mini-grid</b> systems have been examined to evaluate {{if they had the}} potential to be a better solution for South Africa’s rural electrification in the future. Qualitative interviews were carried out in the Limpopo province to gather information directly from the SHS users. Data on consumption and demand beyond the energy provided by the SHS was also collected. <b>Mini-grid</b> 1 was dimensioned for the same energy production as the SHS, while <b>mini-grid</b> 2 was dimensioned to provide users with additional power to cover their demand for fridges found during the research. The systems were dimensioned using equations provided n chapter three and using the methods described in chapter four. The results showed that the end-users were pleased with the SHSs due to various reasons. The SHS resulted in reduced spending on lighting and phone charging. Furthermore, the interviewees experienced increased level of safety when candles were replaced with electric lights. The electric lights quality improved the possibility for children to study after dark. <b>Mini-grid</b> 1 was estimated to have a LCOE of 1. 3 ZAR/kWh, <b>Mini-grid</b> 2 : 1. 4 ZAR/kWh and the SHS: 28 ZAR/kWh.

In this context, the objective of this scientific paper is to analyze the economic feasibility of <b>mini-grids</b> based on renewable energies {{in the context of the}} Ugandan energy market as an off-grid electrification solution. In doing so, financial feasibility of <b>mini-grids</b> is also taken into consideration from macro-economic perspectives and risk management aspects. It acknowledges that off-grid electrification can be seen as mandatory to reach the ambitious national electrification targets and offering a huge opportunity in a so far almost untapped market, while at the same time still facing various financing- and market barriers in Uganda. By an executed case study, the paper simulates the level of subsidies required to reach economic feasibility, revealing that it can only be achieved with high level of subsidies involved due to the currently difficult financing conditions. Therefore, innovative financing recommendations are given by suggesting a layered fund as a multi-level financial support mechanism. Given the appropriate incentives, it can facilitate a subsidy phase-out for <b>mini-grids</b> in regards to a sustainable public sector engagement until self-sustaining market conditions are reached.

Decentralized renewable energy technologies in form of Solar Home Systems and <b>Mini-grids</b> possess the potential of electrifying a large number of rural households which cannot be connected to the national grid with local available energy sources. However, the deployment of <b>Mini-grids</b> is facing barriers such as a lack of private investments. By building on already existing SHSs swarm grids can enable households to trade electricity and use their excess electricity to supply additional loads. Swarm grids as an evolutionary bottom-up approach to electrification can overcome some of the obstacles regular <b>Mini-grids</b> face and {{play a vital role in}} improving electricity access. As part of this thesis a model has been developed which allows for simulating the electricity flow including line losses in swarm grids of any size on an hourly basis. The model facilitates the gaining of a better understanding for the impact global parameters (e. g. distance between households) have on the feasibility of swarm grids. A field trip to Bangladesh has been undertaken in order to obtain input data for simulating different cases in the model created. The simulations performed indicate that in a swarm grid the generated excess energy of SHSs which so far is wasted can supply the demand of households without SHS as well as commercial loads such as irrigation pumps. Overall the results point towards swarm grids being an innovation with the potential of improving rural electricity access by building on existing infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of most rural electrification {{programs in the}} developing world is to bring about socioeconomicdevelopment to households. Governments have put in place a number of measures to achievethis goal. Previous studies on rural electrification programs in developing countries show that solar homesystems and <b>mini-grid</b> systems are the dominant technologies. Assessments of a pilot hybrid mini-gridproject at Lucingweni village have concluded that <b>mini-grid</b> projects are not feasible due to high electricityproduction costs. As a result efforts toward rural electrification have been focused on the solar homesystem. Nevertheless, previous studies of the South African solar home system program have shown thatthe development objectives of the program are yet to be met more than a decade after commissioning. Therefore, this study investigates the viability of a hybrid <b>mini-grid</b> as a solution for rural developmentin South Africa. Investigations were based on Lucingweni and Thlatlaganya, two rural Villages where themini-grid and solar home system have been introduced. The <b>mini-grid</b> systems were designed taking intoconsideration available natural resources and existing load profiles. The results show that a village of 300 households needs about 2. 4 kW h/household/day of electricity to initiate and sustain income generatingactivities and that the solar home system is not capable of supporting this level of demand.
