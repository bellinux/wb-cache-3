5|$|As {{with the}} peasantry, <b>many</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{performed}} ancillary activities, like medics and technicians. Selection for military duty was annual with yearly call-ups and great stock {{was placed on}} military exercises, during the winter months, which formed {{a large part of}} a soldier's life.|$|E
5|$|During {{its journey}} across the {{maritime}} plain to Isdud, the Anzac Mounted Division captured many prisoners but met no large organised Ottoman force. As the day progressed, the captured Ottoman units {{were found to}} be increasingly disorganised with <b>many</b> <b>soldiers</b> suffering severely from thirst and exhaustion and some from dysentery.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 The Economist {{reported}} that the SNA did not exist as a cohesive force due to high rates of desertions and <b>many</b> <b>soldiers</b> being primarily loyal to clan leaders rather than the government.|$|E

50|$|Between Heaven and Hell {{is one of}} the 1950s {{depictions of}} the US Army that did not paint a {{recruiting}} poster image and was more in tune with <b>many</b> <b>soldier's</b> memories such as From Here to Eternity, Robert Aldrich's Attack or Samuel Fuller's films.|$|R
50|$|In April, there weren't {{any changes}} {{on the front lines}} at Rasa Košares and both sides {{suffered}} heavy losses. <b>Many</b> Yugoslav <b>soldiers</b> were killed by the non-stop artillery bombardment, while <b>many</b> KLA <b>soldiers</b> were killed in numerous unsuccessful attempts to break the Yugoslav lines of defense.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the brigade's support to the War on Terrorism, <b>many</b> <b>soldiers</b> of the brigade continually conduct law enforcement and force protection duties in communities located throughout the central region of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The 9th Division's {{role in the}} Second Battle of El Alamein {{ended on}} 5 November 1942. From 30 November the {{division}} travelled to Palestine by road, and all its units arrived there by 9 December. After settling into camps located between Gaza and Qastina, the 9th Division undertook a period of rebuilding and training, and <b>many</b> <b>soldiers</b> were granted leave. On 22 December, a formal parade involving the entire division was conducted at Gaza Airport.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{victories}} wrecked the British carrot-and-stick {{strategy of}} showing overwhelming force then offering generous terms. The Americans would not negotiate for {{anything short of}} independence. These victories alone were not enough to ensure ultimate Patriot victory, however, since <b>many</b> <b>soldiers</b> did not reenlist or deserted during the harsh winter. Washington and Congress reorganized the army with increased rewards for staying and punishment for desertion, which raised troop numbers effectively for subsequent battles.|$|E
50|$|His {{first film}} role {{was in the}} year 1950 in the film Maija löytää sävelen (Finnish: Maija Finds a Tone). Kumpulainen became known {{for his role in}} the 1950s in the Pekka ja Pätkä movies, (Finnish: Pekka and Pätkä), where he did minor roles. He also {{appeared}} in <b>many</b> <b>soldier</b> farces in 1950s and 1960s.|$|R
25|$|The {{final phase}} {{of the war was}} the guerrilla phase where <b>many</b> Boer <b>soldiers</b> turned to Guerrilla tactics such as raiding {{infrastructure}} or communications lines. <b>Many</b> Canadian <b>soldiers</b> did not actually see combat after getting shipped over to South Africa as many arrived {{around the time of the}} signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902.|$|R

5|$|Clark {{graduated}} from the Command and General Staff College (CGSC), earning his military Master of Arts degree in military science from the CGSC with a thesis on American policies of gradualism in the Vietnam War. Clark's theory was one of applying force swiftly, which was being advocated by <b>many</b> <b>soldiers</b> at the time, a concept that would eventually become established as U.S. national security policy {{in the form of}} the Weinberger Doctrine and its successor, the Powell Doctrine. Clark was promoted to major upon his graduation from the CGSC.|$|E
5|$|Germanus was {{successful}} in winning the confidence of <b>many</b> <b>soldiers,</b> re-establishing discipline and defeating the mutineers at the Battle of Scalas Veteres in 537. With imperial control over the army restored, Solomon {{was sent back to}} Africa to replace Germanus in 539, again combining in his person the posts of magister militum and praetorian prefect (in the meantime, he had also been raised to the rank of patricius and named an honorary consul). Solomon further reinforced his control of the army by weeding out unreliable soldiers, sending them to Belisarius in Italy and to the East; by expelling all remaining Vandals from the province; and by initiating a massive programme of fortification across the region.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to deceiving the French, the Rwandan government used the fake attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for launching {{a wave of}} anti-Tutsi propaganda. They encouraged Hutu citizens to arrest Tutsi suspected of supporting the RPF. With French assistance, and benefiting {{from the loss of}} RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the FAR enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF, and pushed the rebels {{all the way back to}} the Ugandan border. <b>Many</b> <b>soldiers</b> deserted; some crossed back into Uganda, while others went into hiding in the Akagera National Park. The Rwandan government announced on 30 October that the war was over.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{intention}} of the soldier settlement farms in the district was fruit growing, the fruit trees required a number of years before they would bear fruit and the government loans on the farms required immediate interest payments. <b>Many</b> <b>soldier</b> settlers turned to vegetable growing, both for their own use and to enable them to sell for a short-term income.|$|R

50|$|Around 1500 {{many people}} in Nidwalden worked as {{mercenary}} <b>soldiers.</b> <b>Many</b> of these <b>soldiers</b> later emigrated. This helped to lessen the pressure of a growing population. A popular destination was Alsace.|$|R
5|$|In response, Samuel sent a large army {{under one}} of the most able Bulgarian nobles, Nestoritsa, to strike southwards and draw the {{attention}} of Basil away from the siege at Klyuch. Nestoritsa's Bulgarians reached Thessalonika, but Byzantine troops under Theophylact Botaneiates, the strategos (Governor-General) of the city and his son Mihail managed to defeat them outside the city walls in a bloody battle. Theophylactus captured <b>many</b> <b>soldiers</b> and a large quantity of military equipment and marched north to join Basil II at Klyuch.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as <b>many</b> <b>soldiers</b> as possible. He broke the Vietminh {{blockade}} around Saigon, then drove through the Mekong delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was {{getting rid of the}} Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} {{affected the}} quantity and quality of his forces. Many of his men's enlistments were due to expire before Christmas, and <b>many</b> <b>soldiers</b> were inclined to leave the army when their commission ended. Several deserted before their enlistments were up. The pending loss of forces, the series of lost battles, the loss of New York, the flight of the Army along with many New Yorkers and the Second Continental Congress to Philadelphia, left many in doubt about the prospects of winning the war. But Washington persisted. He successfully procured supplies and dispatched men to recruit new members of the militia, which was successful in part due to British and Hessian mistreatment of New Jersey and Pennsylvania residents.|$|E

5|$|Shein's army {{retreated to}} its main camp, {{which was in}} turn {{surrounded}} by Commonwealth forces in mid-October. The besieged Russians waited for relief, but none arrived, as Commonwealth and Cossack cavalry {{had been sent to}} disrupt the Russian rear. Some historians also cite dissent and internal divisions in the Russian camp as responsible for their inaction and ineffectiveness (Jasienica blames the Russian warlords, and Parker the foreign mercenaries). The Tatar invasion threatening the south Russian borderlands was a contributory factor, with <b>many</b> <b>soldiers</b> and boyars from those regions deserting the Russian camp to return to protect their homes. Some foreign mercenaries also deserted to the Commonwealth side.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese counter-offensive on Morotai was not successful. The troops {{brought to}} the island {{suffered}} from high rates of disease and it proved impossible to bring sufficient supplies through the Allied air and naval blockade. As a result, while the 2nd Provisional Raiding Unit raided the US perimeter on several occasions, the reinforcements were unable to mount larger attacks and did not impede Allied airfield construction activities. The Japanese force subsequently withdrew into central Morotai where <b>many</b> <b>soldiers</b> died from disease or starvation. The last Japanese supply barges from Halmahera reached Morotai on 12 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{unrest in}} Portugal culminated on April 25, 1974, when the Carnation Revolution, a {{peaceful}} leftist military coup d'état in Lisbon, ousted the incumbent Portuguese government of Marcelo Caetano. Thousands of Portuguese citizens left Mozambique, {{and the new}} head of government, General António de Spínola, called for a ceasefire. With the change of government in Lisbon, <b>many</b> <b>soldiers</b> refused to continue fighting, often remaining in their barracks instead of going on patrol. Negotiations between the Portuguese administration culminated in the Lusaka Accord signed on September 7, 1974, which provided for a complete hand-over of power to FRELIMO, uncontested by elections. Formal independence was set for June 25, 1975, the 13th anniversary of the founding of FRELIMO.|$|E

5|$|The men at {{the front}} had to {{struggle}} with supply problems–there was a shortage of food; and disease was rife in the damp, rat-infested conditions. Along with enemy action, <b>many</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{had to contend with}} new diseases: trench foot, trench fever and trench nephritis. When the war ended in November 1918, British Army casualties, as the result of enemy action and disease, were recorded as 673,375 killed and missing, with another 1,643,469 wounded. The rush to demobilise {{at the end of the}} conflict substantially decreased the strength of the British Army, from its peak strength of 4,000,000 men in 1918 to 370,000 men by 1920.|$|E
5|$|The slouch hat was the {{preferred}} choice of <b>many</b> <b>soldiers,</b> including officers. The hat was normally a floppy, wide brimmed, woolen body head-cover, meant {{to protect the}} individual from the sun, and inclement weather. It was normally a civilian hat, of brown, gray, or black wool. This simple hat saw widespread use throughout the Confederate Armies, and even with U.S. Army personnel. Occasionally, the hat was adorned with insignia of the wearer's preference, {{and may have been}} pinned up for the drill {{in the use of the}} regular weapon of the time, the Rifled-musket.|$|E
5|$|After Martin's death, the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry {{began to}} buckle as {{increasing}} numbers of North Korean troops flooded into Chonan from the Northwest and eastern roads. The battalion suffered heavy casualties, but was saved by the continuous fire laid down by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion. Between 0800 and 1000, U.S. units began a disorganized retreat from the town, <b>many</b> <b>soldiers</b> deserting their units and running from the battle. Wadlington, now {{in command of the}} 34th Infantry, moved 3rd Battalion to a collecting point south of the town, where 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry was holding a blocking position and had not been engaged. As 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry began to pull back to rally points, 1st Battalion began to come under mortar fire from North Korean forces, but withdrew without engaging them.|$|E
