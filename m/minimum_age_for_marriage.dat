25|$|Since the mid-20th century, Kansas has {{remained}} {{one of the}} most socially conservative states in the nation. The 1990s brought the defeat of prominent Democrats, including Dan Glickman, and the Kansas State Board of Education's 1999 decision to eliminate evolution from the state teaching standards, a decision that was later reversed. In 2005, voters accepted a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. The next year, the state passed a law setting a <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>marriage</b> at 15 years. Kansas' path to a solid Republican state has been examined by historian Thomas Frank in his 2004 book What's the Matter with Kansas?.|$|E
25|$|For example, Church {{teaching}} {{heavily influenced}} the legal concept of marriage. During the Gregorian Reform, the Church developed and codified {{a view of}} marriage as a sacrament. In a departure from societal norms, Church law required the consent of both parties before a marriage could be performed and established a <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>marriage.</b> The elevation of marriage to a sacrament also made the union a binding contract, with dissolutions overseen by Church authorities. Although the Church abandoned tradition to allow women {{the same rights as}} men to dissolve a marriage, in practice, when an accusation of infidelity was made, men were granted dissolutions more frequently than women.|$|E

5000|$|Qasim {{attempted}} {{to bring about}} greater equality for women in Iraq. In December 1959 he promulgated a significant revision of the personal status code, particularly that regulating family relations. Polygamy was outlawed, and <b>minimum</b> <b>ages</b> <b>for</b> <b>marriage</b> were also set out, with 18 being the <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> (except <b>for</b> special dispensation when it could be lowered by the court to 16). Women were also protected from arbitrary divorce. The most revolutionary reform was a provision in article 74 giving women equal rights in matters of inheritance. [...] The laws applied to Sunni and Shi’a alike. The laws encountered much opposition and did not survive Qasim’s government.|$|R
25|$|At independence, the {{government}} of President Félix Houphouët-Boigny acknowledged existing decrees affecting {{the status of women}} and went on to establish the primacy of the nuclear family, raise the <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>marriage</b> to eighteen, and condemn in general terms the notion of female inferiority. At the same time, however, legislation during the 1960s established a husband's right to control much of his wife's property, and it required a woman to obtain her husband's permission to establish a bank account or obtain a job. The government also placed restrictions on a woman's right to divorce, denied legal recognition of matrilineal rights of inheritance (inheritance by a man's nephews before his sons), and finally, condemned the practice of bride-price.|$|E

There is evidence that its practice has increased, particularly among the educated Hejazi elite, {{as a result of}} oil wealth. The government has promoted polygamy as part of a return to [...] "Islamic values" [...] program. In 2001, the Grand Mufti (the highest religious authority) issued a fatwa, or opinion, calling upon Saudi women to accept polygamy as part of the Islamic package and declaring that polygamy was necessary [...] "to fight against...the growing epidemic of spinsterhood". There is no <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>marriage</b> in Saudi Arabia and the Grand Mufti reportedly said in 2009 that girls of the age of 10 or 12 were marriageable.|$|E

50|$|Child {{marriage}} was outlawed in 1929, under Indian law. However, in the British colonial times, the legal <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> of {{marriage was}} set at 15 for girls and 18 for boys. Under protests from Muslim organizations in the undivided British India, a personal law Shariat Act was passed in 1937 that allowed child marriages with consent from girl's guardian. After independence and adoption of Indian constitution in 1950, the child marriage act has undergone several revisions. The <b>minimum</b> legal <b>age</b> <b>for</b> <b>marriage,</b> since 1978, has been 18 for women and 21 for men.

50|$|Children born in {{the country}} or to parents who are {{citizens}} of it are entitled to citizenship. About half children are not registered, which can result in denial of access to education or other services. Education is obligatory until age 15. Tuition is free, but books, supplies, transportation, and insurance are not. Girls are denied equal access to primary schooling, and tend to drop out early owing to pressure to marry and have children. Few Ba'aka (Pygmies) go to primary school; the government makes no effort to change this. Child abuse is illegal but widespread, as is FGM. Although the legal <b>minimum</b> <b>age</b> <b>for</b> civil <b>marriage</b> is 18, 61 percent of girls marry before 18. There are no laws against statutory rape or child pornography.
