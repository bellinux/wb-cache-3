40|$|The <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> (the traffic {{made up of}} {{bicycles}} and automobiles) is widely spread in Chinese cities. It is also greatly responsible for major traffic problems, such as the conflicts, low efficiency and safety problems. These problems are most evident at street intersections. However, {{they have never been}} investigated in Chinese cities. Therefore, it is the <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> at intersections that requires detailed study. To predict types of transportation mode in Chinese cities, an investigation in Shanghai was performed. It is found that within a certain distance range, cycling is more efficient than other modes and it will still remain in future urban traffic system of China. Then, <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> would require a new strategy of management. The <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> conflict situation was studied in two major intersections of Chinese cities by analyzing digital video. The research showed that for constant number of automobile, the crossing time for <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> increases with number of bicycles following a logarithmic equation. The crossing time of the <b>mixed</b> <b>traffics</b> with constant number of bicycle increases with number of automobiles following an exponential equation. The suggestions of traffic management strategies and intersection design are presented. It is anticipated that the new management strategies that consider severely the bicycle component can decrease the traffic impact on environment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a gray system theory-based method for the quantitative evaluation and ranking of the operational and safety performance of signalized intersections {{in urban areas}} under <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions. <b>Mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions refer to traffic situations in which motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians share a signalized intersection. Such <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> is a typical phenomenon in many cities {{around the world in}} which the populations of urban areas are extremely large. Five index parameters are used in the proposed method: the degree of saturation, the average stopped delay, the queue length, the conflict ratio, and the separation ratio. These parameters represent the operational and safety performance of a signalized intersection with <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic.</b> They are inputted into the evaluation equations, which are developed according to the gray system theory. The method is applied to the performance evaluation of the intersections and network in the urban area of Changsha, China. the results show that the method can be used to conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation and ranking of signalized intersections under the <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions that are associated with urban road network systems. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

30|$|In this section, a {{methodology}} is developed for simulation of <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions. <b>Mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> flow is considered when speed differential among {{different types of}} vehicles is quite substantial and the desired number of overtaking increases with limited opportunities to overtake [18]. Mehar et al. [19] define as <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions when there are several categories of vehicles sharing and moving on same carriageway width without any physical segregation between motorized and non-motorized vehicles, and without proper lane discipline. Due to the wide variations in physical dimensions and speeds of various vehicles, {{it is difficult to}} impose lane discipline. The vehicles occupy any available lateral position on the road space, while the small vehicles, such as motor cycles often utilize gaps between larger vehicles in the <b>traffic</b> stream. In <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> flow, there are different combinations of vehicles for leader-follower pairs [3].|$|R

30|$|Developing an {{appropriate}} headway distribution model {{is an important}} step in traffic modelling and simulation. Thus, it is imperative to characterise the vehicle time headways statistically using a distribution function. Conventionally, negative exponential distribution function is used; however, several studies on <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> have shown that it does not capture the characteristics of <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> especially on two-lane roads where interaction takes place in both the directions. Besides, arrival pattern of vehicles changes considerably with the flow which may consequence different distributions to work better at different flow conditions. The lookout of the current study was, therefore, to investigate the appropriate headway distribution model on such roads under <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R

Mathematical models are suggested to describe networks including real-time traffic (RTT) and non-real-time traffic (NRT) sources. DBCM directly controls delay to meet strict delay requirement of RTT and controls the NRT buffer to prevent buffer overflow. DBCM is evaluated in terms of punctuality rate and packet loss ratio in the network with an example of <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic.</b> The simulation result shows that DBCM performs better than a scheme combining a bandwidth reservation for RTT and a rate-based heuristic approach for NRT...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{advanced}} technologies and intelligence in vehicles and infrastructure {{could make the}} current highway transportation system much more efficient. Semi-automated vehicles with the capability of automatically following a vehicle in front {{as long as it}} is in the same lane and in the vicinity of the forward looking ranging sensor are expected to be deployed in the near future. Their penetration into the current manual traffic will give rise to <b>mixed</b> manual/semi-automated <b>traffic.</b> In this paper, we analyze the fundamental flow-density curve for <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> using flow-density curves for 100 % manual and 100 % semi-automated traffic. Assuming that semi-automated vehicles use a time headway smaller than today's manual traffic average due to the use of sensors and actuators, we have shown using the flow-density diagram that the traffic flow rate will increase in <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic.</b> We have also shown that the flow-density curve for <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> is restricted between the flow-density curves for 100 % manual and 100 % semi-automated traffic. We have presented in a graphical way that the presence of semi-automated vehicles in <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> propagates a shock wave faster than in manual traffic. We have demonstrated that the presence of semi-automated vehicles does not change the total travel time of vehicles in <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic.</b> Though we observed that with 50 % semi-automated vehicles a vehicle travels 10. 6 % more distance than a vehicle in manual traffic for the same time horizon and starting at approximately the same position, this increase is marginal and is within the modeling error. Lastly, we have shown that when shock waves on the highway produce stop-and-go traffic, the average delay experienced by vehicles at standstill is lower in <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> than in manual traffic, while the average number of vehicles at standstill remains unchanged. ...|$|R

30|$|The present paper {{demonstrates}} {{the effect of}} <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> on distribution of time headways of two-lane roads. Presence of slower vehicles in such traffic leads to frequent formation of platoons, thereby, increases the risk taking behavior of drivers’ while overtaking. As a result, proportion of shorter headways increases resulting in highly skewed observations. Thus, the study proposed Log-logistic distribution under medium flow since it can model events which have ‘increased initial rate’ and Pearson 5 under heavy flow to model ‘highly skewed data’. The model outputs were accordingly compared with other studies and were found to explain the <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> characteristics satisfactorily. The present study, thus, creates a starting point of further initiatives aimed at establishing a robust method of modeling headways on two-lane roads with <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
40|$|Seepage is an {{important}} yet rarely modeled or quantified phenomenon in <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> streams. It describes situations where smaller vehicles do not line up but rather "seep" through a queue of stationary or almost stationary vehicles. This contribution introduces seepage into an agent-based transport simulation model. In order to allow vehicles to seep, the traditional first-in-first-out queue model is modified such that in the free flow regime, faster vehicle can overtake slower vehicles and in the congested regime, slower vehicles can overtake faster vehicles. The model is validated {{with the help of}} fundamental diagrams. Its sensitivity is investigated by comparing the impact of different shares of smaller vehicles on the speed-density relation in <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> streams.
