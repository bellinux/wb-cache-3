George's father took him hunting and riding, and introduced him to military matters; mindful of his uncertain future, Ernest Augustus took the fifteen-year-old George on campaign in the Franco-Dutch War with the deliberate purpose of testing and training his son in battle.|$|E

After visiting France he returned to England en route to Scotland in July, but did not visit the English court.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} with a concubinus might be discreet or more open: male concubines sometimes attended dinner parties with the man whose companion they were. Martial even suggests that a prized concubinus <b>might</b> <b>pass</b> from father to son as an especially coveted inheritance. A military officer on campaign might {{be accompanied by a}} concubinus. Like the catamite or puer delicatus, the role of the concubine was regularly compared to that of Ganymede, the Trojan prince abducted by Jove (Greek Zeus) to serve as his cupbearer.|$|E

For elongated and flat particles a sieve analysis will not yield reliable mass-based results, as the particle size reported will assume that the particles are spherical, where in fact an elongated particle <b>might</b> <b>pass</b> through the screen end-on, but would be prevented from doing so if it presented itself side-on.|$|E

In the film, Harry realizes that the Elder Wand is too {{powerful}} to fall into the wrong hands again, so he snaps it in two and throws it off a bridge. He also drops the Resurrection Stone in the Forbidden Forest but decides not to look for it in the hope that no wizard or witch {{will ever be able to}} own all three Hallows. He keeps the Cloak he had inherited, with the thought that he <b>might</b> <b>pass</b> it on to his children someday.|$|E
25|$|Rumours {{followed}} Shivaji's death, with Muslims opining he {{had died}} of a curse from Jan Muhammad of Jalna, and some Marathas whispering that Soyarabai, the youngest of the three wives who survived him, had poisoned him so that his crown <b>might</b> <b>pass</b> to her 10-year-old son Rajaram.After Shivaji's death, Soyarabai made plans with various ministers of the administration to crown her son Rajaram rather than her prodigal stepson Sambhaji. On 21 April 1680, ten-year-old Rajaram was installed on the throne. However, Sambhaji took possession of the Raigad Fort after killing the commander, and on 18 June acquired control of Raigad, and formally ascended the throne on 20 July. Rajaram, his wife Janki Bai, and mother Soyrabai were imprisoned, and Soyrabai executed on charges of conspiracy that October.|$|E

25|$|Rated Powerâ€“ Nominal (or even continuous) power, and peak (or maximum short-term) power a {{loudspeaker}} can handle (i.e., maximum input power before destroying the loudspeaker; {{it is never}} the sound output the loudspeaker produces). A driver may be damaged at much less than its rated power if driven past its mechanical limits at lower frequencies. Tweeters can also be damaged by amplifier clipping (amplifier circuits produce large amounts of energy at high frequencies in such cases) or by music or sine wave input at high frequencies. Each of these situations <b>might</b> <b>pass</b> more energy to a tweeter than it can survive without damage. In some jurisdictions, power handling has a legal meaning allowing comparisons between loudspeakers under consideration. Elsewhere, the variety of meanings for power handling capacity can be quite confusing.|$|E
25|$|For many experiments, it is {{possible}} to think of the initial and final conditions of the system as being a particle. In some cases it appears that there are potentially several spatially distinct pathways or trajectories by which a particle <b>might</b> <b>pass</b> from initial to final condition. It is an important feature of the quantum kinematic description that it does not permit a unique definite statement of which of those pathways is actually followed. Only the initial and final conditions are definite, and, as stated in the foregoing paragraph, they are defined only as precisely as allowed by the configuration space description or its equivalent. In every case for which a quantum kinematic description is needed, there is always a compelling reason for this restriction of kinematic precision. An example of such a reason is that for a particle to be experimentally found in a definite position, it must be held motionless; for it to be experimentally found to have a definite momentum, it must have free motion; these two are logically incompatible.|$|E
500|$|One {{important}} change that {{did make it}} into the final version included the agreement between northern and southern delegates to empower Congress to end the slave trade starting in 1808. Southern and northern delegates also agreed to strengthen the Fugitive Slave Clause in exchange for removing a requirement that two-thirds of Congress agree on [...] "navigation acts" [...] (regulations of commerce between states and foreign governments). The two-thirds requirement was favored by southern delegates, who thought Congress <b>might</b> <b>pass</b> navigation acts that would be economically harmful to slaveholders.|$|E

[...] Hobart was laid to rest at Cedar Lawn Cemetery in Paterson after a large public funeral, attended by President McKinley and many high government officials.

500|$|The New Age {{movement}} typically {{views the}} material universe as a meaningful illusion, which humans {{should try to}} use constructively rather than focus on escaping into other spiritual realms. This physical world is hence seen as [...] "a domain for learning and growth" [...] after which the human soul <b>might</b> <b>pass</b> on {{to higher levels of}} existence. There is thus a widespread belief that reality is engaged in an ongoing process of evolution; rather than Darwinian evolution, this is typically seen as either a teleological evolution which assumes a process headed to a specific goal, or an open-ended, creative evolution.|$|E
500|$|Melvin {{defended his}} {{decision}} to hold people without access to legal advice by arguing that lawyers, unwittingly or otherwise, <b>might</b> <b>pass</b> information they had gleaned during interviews to other suspects. He said under cross-examination during the 1987 murder trial that, in his view, [...] "the integrity of some firms of solicitors left {{a lot to be}} desired"; he believed solicitors were being retained by people who had an interest in learning what other suspects had said. The Crown prosecutor, Roy Amlot QC, told the court that the police had one effective weapon, namely that suspects did not know who else had spoken to police and what they had said, and that [...] "the use of that weapon by the police was legitimate and effective." ...|$|E

500|$|No {{definite}} record exists of {{how exactly}} Pericles managed {{to convince the}} residents of Attica to agree {{to move into the}} crowded urban areas. For most, the move meant abandoning their land and ancestral shrines and completely changing their lifestyle. [...] Therefore, although they agreed to leave, many rural residents were far from happy with Pericles' decision. Pericles also gave his compatriots some advice on their present affairs and reassured them that, if the enemy did not plunder his farms, he would offer his property to the city. This promise was prompted by his concern that Archidamus, who was a friend of his, <b>might</b> <b>pass</b> by his estate without ravaging it, either as a gesture of friendship or as a calculated political move aimed to alienate Pericles from his constituents.|$|E
500|$|Mays {{spent most}} of July 31 {{drafting}} this legislation with four others: Almond; Mays' associate Henry T. Wickham; Commission staffer John B. Boatwright, Jr.; and George McIver [...] "Mack" [...] Lapsley (Director of the Division of Statutory Research and Drafting for the General Assembly). [...] They considered {{a number of different}} ways to implement the pupil assignment plan, and decided to bring the various alternatives before the Gray Commission. Wickham was given the task of putting into legislative language the decisions the group made. That same day, Judge Bryan ordered Arlington County public schools desegregated. Mays told the drafting group that Bryan's decision invited a pupil assignment program and suggested it <b>might</b> <b>pass</b> constitutional muster. Almond agreed, and on August 1 told the press that Judge Bryan's decision left open the possibility of implementing a pupil assignment plan that would be neutral on its face but which could keep schools segregated.|$|E
