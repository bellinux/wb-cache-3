50|$|In 2005, 3PAR's InServ storage server was marketed for {{business}} data centers. It included the models T400 and T800 which compete with high-end <b>monolithic</b> <b>storage</b> arrays like the EMC DMX and HDS USP, and the models F200 and F400 which compete with modular storage arrays like the EMC CX and HP EVA. The same InForm operating system software suite runs across both the F- and T-class platforms.In 2011, interfaces included Fibre Channel, and Gigabit Ethernet for the iSCSI storage protocol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monolithic</b> <b>storage</b> {{architectures}} share RAM {{across multiple}} IO controllers. They have been characterized as large storage arrays {{that require a}} large upfront investment and resources. Hitachi Data Systems, {{is quoted as saying}} such storage requires enterprises to spend $500,000 on customizing their data centers to support the power requirements of monolithic equipment. Monolithic arrays provide failover benefits. The shared cache architecture of monolithic arrays ensures that if one cache module fails, another cache is used to process the user's request. However once you have more than a single system this architecture is complex and requires investment to manage and control the interactions between the different components. Monolithic architectures support both block and file-based architectures, either independently or in a unified storage system that brings together both block and file.|$|E
40|$|Vast {{quantities}} {{of information is}} now being stored online. Web applications currently rely on <b>monolithic</b> <b>storage</b> structures which place the sole responsibility of data storage, protection and maintenance on the web application provider. This research introduces {{the concept of a}} de-centralised approach for information storage online. Distributed storage techniques are used to address concerns with the classic monolithic approach while also addressing issues such as data ownership concerns for personal information. The research results in the presentation on an API that allows distributed storage of information with seamless integration of data into the traditional Web 2. 0 model...|$|E
40|$|A {{modeling}} {{framework for}} integrated water resource {{management at the}} sub-basin scale for the Ken – Betwa water transfer link (hereafter referred to as KB-link), {{a part of the}} Greater Ganges river basin (in India), is presented. A Super Reservoir Model (hereafter referred to as SRM) was developed to explore the adequacy of the combined storage capacity of the linked reservoir system when rainfall, evapo-transpiration, and irrigation demands are considered at sub-annual time scales. Previous official feasibility studies only considered the variability of these same processes at annual time scales. The irrigation demands here are formulated as scenarios and include a number of cropping configuration and planned increases in agricultural production. The SRM assumes that the entire network of reservoirs function as a <b>monolithic</b> <b>storage</b> collection mechanism (or super-reservoir), thereby allowing a simplified mass balance analysis to be conducted. This project demonstrated that the integrated storage volume proposed in the feasibility report for the KB-link is inadequate with probabilities of complete ‘dry-downs’ ranging from 15 % to 35 %, depending on the scenario. On the practical side, the resulting integrated model of the watershed developed in this project {{can be used as a}} tool to facilitate debates and consultations between stakeholders and thus enhance the participatory process. In this sense, this simplified ‘simulator’ is an effective tool to explore the individual and cumulative impacts of water – resource management at sub- basin scale. The Matlab source code is provided upon request...|$|E
