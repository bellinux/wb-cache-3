Developing new materials for capturing CO 2 emitted from coal-fired plants can potentially mitigate {{the effect of these}} CO 2 emissions. In this study, we developed and optimized porous hollow fiber sorbents with both improved sorption capacities and rapid sorption kinetics by functionalizing aminosilane (N-(2 -aminoethyl) - 3 - aminoisobutyldimethylmethoxysilane) to cellulose <b>acetate</b> hollow <b>fibers</b> as a "proof of concept". A lumen-side barrier layer was also developed in the aminosilane-functionalized cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>fiber</b> sorbent to allow for facile heat exchange without significant mass transfer with the bore-side heat transfer fluid. The functionalized cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>fiber</b> sorbents were characterized by pressure decay sorption measurements, multicomponent column chromatography, FT-IR, elemental analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The carbon dioxide sorption capacity at 1 atm is 0. 73 mmol/g by using the pressure decay apparatus. Multicomponent column chromatography measurements showed that aminosilane functionalized cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>fiber</b> sorbent has a CO 2 sorption capacity of 0. 23 mmol/g at CO 2 partial pressure 0. 1 atm and 35 C in simulated flue gas. While this capacity is low, our proof of concept positions the technology to move forward to higher capacity with work that is underway. The presence of silicon and nitrogen elements in the elemental analysis confirmed the success of grafting along with FT-IR spectra which showed the absorbance peak (∼ 810 cm- 1) for Si-C stretching. A cross-linked Neoprene material was used to form the lumen-side barrier layer. Preliminary data showed the required reduction in gas permeance to eliminate mixing between shell side and bore side fluid flows. Specifically the permeance was reduced from 10 000 GPUs for the neat fibers to 6. 6 ± 0. 1 and 3. 3 ± 0. 3 GPUs for the coated fibers.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a retrospective cohort study of cancer mortality among {{employees of the}} Celanese Canada Inc. synthetic textiles plant in Drummondville, Quebec. The study was commissioned by the company to confirm or refute a previous observation (Vobecky et al., Cancer 54 : 2537 - 2542, 1984) that there were higher mortality rates from colorectal cancer among male employees of the textiles unit, the cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>fiber</b> manufacturing unit, and the cellulose triacetate and polypropylene extrusion units and to investigate whether mortality rates for other sites of cancer were associated with employment in each area of the plant and with occupational exposures. Workers {{with more than one}} year experience at the plant were eligible for study if they were employed on January 1, 1947 or if they were newly hired between that date and December 31, 1977. Vital status as of December 31, 1986 was ascertained for 7, 422 men and 2, 720 women through a probabilistic record linkage to the Canadian Mortality Data Base. Among men, there were about 220, 000 person-years of observation and 1, 738 deaths and, among women, there were about 89, 000 person-years of observation and 241 deaths. Three reference regions were used to derive standardized mortality ratios (SMR) : the entire Province of Quebec, semi-rural regions of the Province, and the area in which the plant is located. Results based on rates for these regions were generally similar. For men, the SMR for all causes of death was significantly less than unity (SMR = 0. 71, 95 %CI: 0. 68 - 0. 74), as were the SMRs for most sites of cancer (SMR all neoplasms = 0. 73, 95 %CI: 0. 66 - 0. 80). The SMR for colorectal cancer was 0. 68 (95 %CI: 0. 51 - 0. 91). Of the 20 cancer sites examined in men, reticulum cell sarcoma was the only one having a significantly elevated SMR, and this occurred only among the subcohort of men hired prior to 1947 (SMR = 2. 84, 95 %CI: 1. 04 - 6. 18, 6 deaths). For women, the SMR for all causes of death was 0. 75 (95 %CI: 0. 66 - 0. 85) and there were moderately elevated SMRs for a number of sites of cancer, but none were significantly greater than expectation (SMR all neoplasms = 0. 97, 95 %CI: 0. 80 - 1. 17). SMRs were also calculated according to employment in each processing unit and exposure to occupational agents, and case-control analyses were carried out within the cohort for selected sites of cancer. Of the scores of associations tested, very few were significantly elevated. There were excesses of biliary cancers and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas among workers in the cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>fiber</b> manufacturing unit. There were also significant associations between stomach cancer and exposure to cutting oils, and between prostate cancer and exposure to glycol monobutyl ether. However, none of these associations were persuasive. With regards to colorectal cancer, there was a nonsignificant elevation in risk among workers who had ever worked in the polypropylene and cellulose triacetate extrusion unit (OR$ sb{ rm e}$ = 2. 3, 95 %CI: 0. 5 - 9. 9) but there was no apparent increase in risk with increasing duration of employment. Thus, the evidence for an association was not convincing. For the cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>fiber</b> manufacturing unit, the evidence of an increase, although based on few cases, was slightly more persuasive (OR$ sb{ rm e}$ = 1. 9, 95 %CI: 1. 0 - 3. 6), but no trend was observed with duration. No association was observed with employment in the textiles unit (OR$ sb{ rm e}$ = 1. 1, 95 %CI: 0. 6 - 2. 2) nor were there any noteworthy associations between colorectal cancer and any of the agents evaluated in the case-control analyses...|$|R
50|$|The {{loudspeaker}} driver's {{moving mass}} and compliance (slackness or reciprocal stiffness of the suspension) determines the driver's resonant frequency (Fs). In {{combination with the}} damping properties of the system (both mechanical and electrical) all these factors affect the low-frequency response of sealed-box systems. Output falls below the system's resonant frequency (Fc), defined as the frequency of peak impedance. In a closed-box, the air inside the box acts as a spring, returning the cone to the 'zero' position {{in the absence of}} a signal. A significant increase in the effective volume of a sealed-box loudspeaker can be achieved by a filling of fibrous material, typically fiberglass, bonded <b>acetate</b> <b>fiber</b> (BAF) or long-fiber wool. The effective volume increase can be as much as 40% and is due primarily to a reduction in the speed of sound propagation through the filler material as compared to air. The enclosure or driver must have a small leak so internal and external pressures can equalise over time, to compensate for barometric pressure or altitude; the porous nature of paper cones, or an imperfectly sealed enclosure, is normally sufficient to provide this slow pressure equalisation.|$|R

Screening the {{environment}} for new and highly potent strains of Bacillus thuringiensis (B. thuringiensis) has become inevitable {{as one of the}} strategies for insect resistance management. By adopting the <b>modified</b> <b>acetate</b> selection method, ento-mocidally potent B. thuringiensis isolates were obtained from grain samples and soil samples from sericulture environment. PCR was performed to determine the insecticidal potential of the isolates. SDS-PAGE analysis of PCR positive isolates exhibited typical Cry 1 protein profiles with 130 to 140 kDa protoxin. Preliminary larvicidal assays against Heliothis armigera with spore-crystal mixture, showed that all 30 B. thuringiensis isolates were toxic to this species. Two isolates, namely BTRX 24 (B. thuringiensis RathinamXavier 24) and BTRX 28 (B. thuringiensis RathinamXavier 28) showed higher mortality compared to other isolates. A dose response efficacy study was conducted in Heliothis armigera, Plutella xylostella with BTRX 24 and BTRX 28.

Scanning electron microscope images of the nanocomposite show that hot-press casting of the fibrous-ZnO network breaks the network up into short fibers. The in-plane distribution of the ZnO fillers (i. e., the short fibers) in the PVDF matrix appears to comply {{with that of the}} pristine ZnO fibers before hot-pressing, indicating that the fillers remain well-dispersed in the polymer matrix. To the authors' knowledge, the work reported herein is the first demonstration of the use of electrospinning to secure the dispersion and distribution of a network of inorganic fillers. Moreover, processing a fibrous-ZnO/PVDF flexible composite as described in this report would facilitate material handling and enable dielectric property measurement, in contrast to that on a fibrous mat of pure ZnO. Because of the high surface area of the short ZnO fibers and their polycrystalline structure, interfacial polarization is pronounced in the nanocomposite film. The dielectric constant is enhanced significantly-up to a factor of 10 at low frequencies compared to the dielectric constant of constituent materials (both bulk ZnO and PVDF), and up to a factor of two compared to a bulk-ZnO/PVDF composite.

40|$|Aerosol {{filtration}} using electrospun {{cellulose acetate}} filters with different mean fiber diameters is reported, {{and the results}} are compared with those for two conventional filter media, a glass fiber filter and a cellulose acetate microfiber filter. The performance of these filters was studied using two aerosols, one solid (NaCl) and one liquid (diethyl hexyl sebacate), under conditions of relatively high face velocity (45 cm/s). The experimental observations are compared to theoretical predictions based on single fiber filtration efficiency. Our results indicate that the mechanisms for single fiber filtration efficiency provide reasonable predictions of the most penetrating particle size (MPPS), in the range of 40 – 270 nm, percentage penetration from 0. 03 to 70 %, and fiber diameter in the range from 0. 1 to 24 µm. Using an analysis based on blocking filtration laws, we conclude that filtration by cake formation dominated in the case of NaCl aerosols on electrospun filter media, whereas filters with larger fiber diameter showed a transition in mechanisms, from an initial regime characterized by pore blocking to a later regime characterized by cake formation. The liquid aerosol did not exhibit cake formation, even for the smallest fiber diameters, and also had much smaller influence on pressure drop than did the solid aerosol. The electrospun filters demonstrated slightly better quality factors compared to the commercial glass fiber filter, at a much lower thickness.
