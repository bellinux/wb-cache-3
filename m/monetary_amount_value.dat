40|$|Conceptualizing {{externalities}} from perceived {{nuclear risk}} as being related to distance from nuclear facilities, we estimate {{the relationship between}} Swiss citizens' life satisfaction (understood as a proxy of utility) and the distance of their place of residence from the nearest nuclear power plant.
