5|$|In 1956, Tory leader George A. Drew {{unexpectedly}} resigned due to ill health. In his place, the PC party {{elected the}} fiery and charismatic Diefenbaker. The Tories ran a campaign centred {{on their new}} leader, who attracted large crowds to rallies and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> impression on television. The Liberals ran a lacklustre campaign, and St. Laurent made few television appearances. Uncomfortable with the medium, the Prime Minister read his speeches from a script and refused to wear makeup.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007–08 season, Tasci <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{performance}} against Schalke in {{the opening}} game; kicker described his performance as clever and cool. He made his Champions League debut on matchday one, as Stuttgart lost 2–1 to Rangers. He scored his first goal {{of the season in}} a 4–1 loss against Hamburger SV on 20 October 2007. Tasci made 21 appearances that season, most of which he missed due to injuries.|$|E

5|$|Scotland {{appointed}} Ally MacLeod {{as manager}} in 1977, with qualification for the 1978 World Cup in Argentina far from assured. The team <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> start under MacLeod {{by winning the}} 1977 British Home Championship, largely thanks to a 2–1 victory over England at Wembley. The Scotland fans invaded the pitch after the match, ripping up the turf and breaking a crossbar. Scotland's good form continued as they secured qualification for the World Cup with victories over Czechoslovakia and Wales.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} events in 2006 pushed {{renewable}} energy up the political agenda, including the US mid-term elections in November, which confirmed clean energy as a mainstream issue. Also in 2006, the Stern Review <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> economic case for investing in low carbon technologies now, and argued that economic growth need not be incompatible with cutting energy consumption. According to a trend analysis from the United Nations Environment Programme, climate change concerns coupled with recent high oil prices and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.|$|E

5|$|In Keegan's first season, 1971–72, Liverpool {{missed out}} on winning the League Championship by a single point, the title going to Brian Clough's Derby County. Shankly {{maintained}} that Liverpool were denied a definite penalty in their crucial away match against Derby and then had a good goal disallowed {{towards the end of}} their final match against Arsenal. Both decisions cost the team a vital point which would have been enough to claim first place. Shankly took encouragement from the team's overall form, especially as they <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> finish to the season, and he was confident of success in 1972–73.|$|E
5|$|Carey's debut studio album <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{impact on}} pop music, but the singer became {{interested}} in altering her sound and branching out into other genres for her second studio effort, Emotions (1991). Columbia allowed her to take more control over her musical direction, enabling her to change the musical genre, melodies, and production style. Carey worked with many new musicians and producers on the album; Walter Afanasieff being the only holdover from her debut. Emotions contained influences from 1950s, 60s, and 70s balladry, gospel, R and soul music. The album, while praised by some as being more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort; selling fewer units and failing to introduce Carey into new markets. Columbia decided to return Carey to the same genre as her debut album and have her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly record. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals and soften the album's production to create a contemporary pop record. Carey and Afanasieff agreed to the change and began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box (1993).|$|E
5|$|England beat Argentina 1–0 in {{the last}} eight, with Geoff Hurst scoring with a header; the match was sullied by the first-half sending off of Argentinian midfielder Antonio Rattín, who refused to leave the pitch after being {{dismissed}} for dissent. In contrast to the previous games, the semi-final against Portugal {{proved to be a}} fair contest between two sides of talented players eager to attack {{from the start of the}} match. Yet there was panic in the buildup to the game as trainer Harold Shepherdson forgot to buy chewing gum, which Banks used to make his hands stickier and better able to handle the ball, and so Shepherdson had to run to a nearby newsagents to purchase gum as the teams were in the tunnel. Bobby Charlton scored two goals, but Portugal <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> finish and won a penalty on 82 minutes after Jack Charlton handled the ball in the penalty area. Eusébio converted the penalty after sending Banks the wrong way, and the game finished 2–1 in England's favour. This was the first goal Banks had conceded for England in 721 minutes of regular play, since giving up Scotland's last goal after 81 minutes of the Home International clash in April. This remains a record for an England goalkeeper.|$|E

5|$|In any case, Brown {{had done}} enough to be chosen to tour England with the Invincibles in 1948, {{although}} Barnes and Morris were the first-choice opening combination. Brown <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> start in the tour matches preceding the Tests. In the fifth fixture, which was against Cambridge University, Brown top-scored with 200 in an innings victory. In the following match against Essex, Brown combined with Bradman in a second-wicket partnership of 219 in 90 minutes, ending with 153 as Australia scored a world-record 721 runs in one day. Australia proceeded to another innings victory, and Brown completed his third century in as many innings with 108 against Oxford University. He preceded to add a fourth century {{in less than three}} weeks, with 122 against Nottinghamshire, and made an unbeaten 81 against Hampshire. In contrast, middle-order batsman Neil Harvey had struggled in the initial stages of his first tour of England, failing to pass 25 in his first six innings. Thus, Brown gained selection in the First Test at Trent Bridge, batting out of position in the middle order, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{report that}} Bela Lugosi and Claude Rains were considered, {{with varying degrees}} of seriousness, for the role of Frankenstein's mentor, Pretorius; others report that the role was created {{specifically}} for Ernest Thesiger. Because of Mae Clarke's ill health, Valerie Hobson replaced her as Henry Frankenstein's love interest, Elizabeth. Early in production, Whale decided that the same actress cast to play the Bride should also play Mary Shelley in the film's prologue, to represent how the story— and horror in general— springs from {{the dark side of the}} imagination. He considered Brigitte Helm and Phyllis Brooks before deciding on Elsa Lanchester. Lanchester, who had accompanied husband Charles Laughton to Hollywood, had met with only moderate success while Laughton had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> impact with several films including The Private Life of Henry VIII (for which he had won an Oscar) and Whale's own The Old Dark House. Lanchester had returned alone to London when Whale contacted her to offer her the dual role. Lanchester modeled the Bride's hissing on the hissing of swans. She gave herself a sore throat while filming the hissing sequence, which Whale shot from multiple angles.|$|E
5|$|The {{knee injury}} {{prevented}} Toshack from playing during the 1948–1949 Australian domestic season. The Australian team to tour South Africa in 1949–50 was named {{at the end}} of the previous season, and Toshack was omitted after a season on the sidelines. At the start of the 1949–50 season, when his Test teammates were sailing across the Indian Ocean to South Africa, Toshack <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> start to his first-class comeback. He took 4/41 and 5/59 in a Shield match against Queensland in Brisbane, removing Ken Mackay and Wally Grout twice, helping to seal a close 15-run win. In the second match, against Western Australia, Toshack took 4/68 in the first innings before his injury resurfaced. New South Wales won the match despite Toshack's inability to bowl in the second innings. The injury cost Toshack dearly; it forced him to retire from first-class cricket and cost him a Test recall. Toshack had been offered a position on the South African tour as a reinforcement for Johnston, who had been involved in a car crash. Instead, Miller took the position and played in all five Tests.|$|E
50|$|Between 2003 and 2004 WAP <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> {{resurgence}} {{with the}} introduction of wireless services (such as Vodafone Live!, T-Mobile T-Zones and other easily accessible services). Operator revenues were generated by transfer of GPRS and UMTS data, which is a different business model than that used by the traditional Web sites and ISPs. According to the Mobile Data Association, WAP traffic in the UK doubled from 2003 to 2004.|$|R
50|$|Lovelace's {{candidacy}} {{was largely}} quixotic, {{although it did}} garner some interest from disaffected Republicans and Democrats. The Prosperity doctor emphasized working across party lines, health care reform, opposition to school vouchers and job creation. Sanford largely ignored Lovelace's campaign, even refusing to attend a South Carolina Educational Television (SCETV) debate with his opponent. Although Lovelace <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> than expected showing in the primary, his loss was not surprising.|$|R
5000|$|Democrats <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> {{effort to}} win the seat than in the {{previous}} election cycles with the popular Thune choosing to challenge incumbent Senator Tim Johnson rather than seek re-election.

5|$|Their {{first such}} {{expedition}} {{took place on}} October 3, 1862, about {{two weeks after the}} regiment reached Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts formed a peripheral part of the Expedition against Franklin, a joint effort of the U.S. Army and Navy to dislodge a growing force of Confederates threatening the Union garrison at Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts held a road near Western Branch Church, far from the main action at Franklin, and here loaded their muskets {{for the first time in}} action. Although the 6th Massachusetts did not see any combat during their first expedition, and many members recalled it as tedious, the sight of ambulances carrying dead and wounded from the battle <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> impression on the new recruits. During a second expedition to the Blackwater on December 11, 1862, the 6th Massachusetts was lightly engaged near Zuni, Virginia and lost their first casualty in battle during their second enlistment—2nd Lieutenant Robert G. Barr. The regiment did not again leave Suffolk until an expedition on January 29, 1863, again towards the Blackwater River. Confederates opposed this Union advance on January 30 during the Battle of Deserted House in an isolated location about ten miles west of Suffolk. The 6th Massachusetts was sharply engaged and lost five killed and seven wounded.|$|E
5|$|England <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> {{start in}} their second innings—the openers {{registered}} their second century stand for the match. When Australia took the second new ball, Lindwallworried by the substantial and hazardous craters in the pitch {{he and the other}} bowlers had created while following through on the left-hand side of the creasechanged to bowling from around the wicket and was warned for running on the pitch. He reverted to bowling from over the wicket, although he delivered {{from the edge of the}} crease to avoid the holes. O’Reilly said the warning to Lindwall played into Australia’s hands as the bowler’s follow through from around the wicket was accentuating a rough patch outside the right-hander’s off stump that the English bowlers target when Bradman’s men had to chase the target. England reached 2/232 before Lindwall trapped Edrich to end a 103-run partnership. The paceman followed this by bowling Jack Crapp, who inside edged an attempted forcing stroke through the off side from the back foot onto his own stumps. This triggered a collapse of 4/33 from 3/260 to 7/293. Lindwall took 2/84 as the hosts declared on the final day at 8/365, leaving Australia to chase a world Test record of 404 for victory, with only 345 minutes available. Centuries to Bradman and Morris in a 301-run stand saw Australia seal the series 3–0 with a record-breaking seven-wicket win with 15 minutes in hand.|$|E
5|$|Winning six {{of their}} first eight matches in 1984–85, York were top of the Third Division by early October 1984. After a run of two wins from 11 matches, they slipped to 11th place in mid December 1984, though they {{continued}} to occupy a top half position before finishing the season in eighth place. In January 1985, York beat First Division team Arsenal 1–0 {{at home in the}} FA Cup fourth round, courtesty of a late penalty scored by Keith Houchen. They reached the fifth round for the third time and drew 1–1 at home to European Cup holders Liverpool. They lost 7–0 in the replay at Anfield—the club's record cup defeat. York started 1985–86 well and were second in the table by late November 1985, before a poor midseason spell saw them drop into midtable. After being unbeaten in the last nine matches, they finished seventh in the table, marking the fifth consecutive season in which York's end-of-season league placing improved. They reached the FA Cup fifth round for the second consecutive season, again drawing 1–1 at home to Liverpool, before losing 3–1 after extra time at Anfield. York <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> start to 1986–87, and in late September 1986 they were in second place. They won only seven of their remaining 38 matches and needed a point from their last match to avoid the danger of relegation, which they achieved with a 1–1 draw against Notts County. York finished 1986–87 in 20th place.|$|E
