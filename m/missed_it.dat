5|$|After {{the first}} robbery attempt, Mauboussin's {{jewellery}} firm opened a branch in New York City on 1 October 1929, {{only to be}} met by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 {{at the end of}} October. To compound matters, the same gang of international robbers tried to steal the Nassak Diamond again in May 1930, but once again <b>missed</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|No tells Bond that he {{is working}} with the Russians and has built an {{elaborate}} underground facility from which he can sabotage US test missiles launched from Cape Canaveral. He had previously been a member of a Chinese tong, but after he stole a large amount of money from their treasury, he was captured by the organisation. The tong's leaders had No's hands cut off as a warning to others, and then shot. Because No's heart was {{on the right side of}} his body, the bullet <b>missed</b> <b>it</b> and he survived.|$|E
5|$|The {{last show}} on 15 September 2001 saw {{many of the}} old {{features}} and presenters return including leprechauns Mr Sage and Mr Onion who acknowledged in the final few minutes of the show that they were the longest serving presenters of the show. The show then ended with Mr Onion pulling the 'Off' switch plunging the studio into darkness. A match was then struck revealing Cawood, Suttie, Farley and Deley standing in the darkness. After saying <b>Missed</b> <b>It?</b> Missed Out!', a reference to the show's former catchphrase, they blew the match out sending the studio back into darkness symbolising {{the end of the show}} and the end of an era.|$|E

5|$|On 22November 1941, during Operation Crusader, Rawlinson led No.3 Squadron on a bomber escort mission near Bir el Gubi in the morning, and {{a fighter}} sweep {{south-east}} of El Adem in the afternoon. German Messerschmitt Bf109 fighters shot down three Tomahawks {{for the loss}} of two of their own in the first action, Rawlinson claiming a 109 damaged. In the second action, a drawn-out battle for air superiority, the squadron lost six Tomahawks against two 109s destroyed, one of which was claimed by Rawlinson along with one probable and one damaged. He had also taken a shot at a distant 109 and, believing he had <b>missed</b> <b>it,</b> did not claim. After the war it was established that Rawlinson's bullets had damaged the 109 and wounded its pilot, Ernst Düllberg, who made a forced landing back at base. Rawlinson was credited with his final victory on 30November, when he downed an Italian Macchi C.200 in an engagement that saw No.3 Squadron's tally of claims rise to 106 aircraft destroyed.|$|E

25|$|In 1939, at Eastbourne against Worcestershire {{he scored}} 89 in 44 minutes. He {{was caught by}} Charles Palmer at deep extra cover off a hit that, like the one against Yorkshire in 1938, would have gone for six had he <b>missed</b> <b>it.</b> At {{the end of the}} season, he played in what was to be Hedley Verity's last match before he died in the Second World War. On a drying wicket Verity took 7 for 9, Bartlett being one of the victims.|$|E
25|$|With the {{division}} commander down, Bonaparte's {{chief of staff}} Louis-Alexandre Berthier arrived to direct the fighting. In the wee hours, 75th Line and the 17th Light Infantry Demi-Brigades added their weight to the battle. By dawn, convinced that the odds against him were increasing, Schübirz withdrew. Given some breathing room by his lieutenant's all-night combat, on 9 May Beaulieu directed his troops to cross the Adda farther north at Lodi. The Battle of Lodi occurred on 10 May, though Schübirz <b>missed</b> <b>it,</b> having been ordered to march four battalions and four squadrons to Crema.|$|E

25|$|Brunel, a heavy smoker, who {{had been}} {{diagnosed}} with Bright's disease (nephritis), suffered a stroke in September 1859, just before the Great Eastern made her first voyage to New York. He died ten days later at the age of 53 and was buried, like his father, in Kensal Green Cemetery in London. The grave is insignificant {{by the standards of the}} cemetery and easily <b>missed.</b> <b>It</b> lies south of the main central path, midway between the entrance and the central chapel, around 20m from the path and screened by trees.|$|E
25|$|Half an hour {{into the}} final day, Warne finally turned the tide back in favour of the Australians and {{effectively}} sealed the victory. Thorpe pushed forward to a fuller delivery and <b>missed</b> <b>it,</b> then Hick was caught {{off the back of}} his bat after the ball ricocheted off his arm. Gooch added 30 with Gatting and another 30 with wicketkeeper Steve Rhodes, but both managed to nick the new ball to Healy off McDermott's bowling. Warne cleaned up the tail to finish with match figures of 11–108 and pick up the man-of-the-match award, and the game was over before tea on the final day, England mustering 323.|$|E
25|$|Jennings was a {{contestant}} on {{an episode}} of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? that aired on October 10, 2008, which held the possibility of exceeding Rutter's total game show winnings. After winning $500,000, enough to surpass Rutter's total, Jennings chose not to attempt the final $1,000,000 question, which would have deducted $475,000 from his winnings if he <b>missed</b> <b>it.</b> As is customary on the show, Jennings was then shown the question {{to see what would}} have happened, and he provided the correct answer. Had he risked his winnings and correctly answered the question, he would have become the show's second $1,000,000 winner.|$|E

25|$|Kansas {{completed}} the first all top-seeded Final Four in NCAA Tournament history as they defeated 10th seeded Davidson 59-57. The outcome remained in doubt {{down to the}} final seconds. Kansas' Sherron Collins missed a shot with 21 seconds left, giving Davidson the final shot. Sophomore star Stephen Curry was double teamed, couldn't find a shot, and passed to Jason Richards, whose three point shot <b>missed.</b> <b>It</b> was head coach Bill Self's first regional final win. The Wildcats' 25-game winning streak, the longest in the nation, was broken with the loss. Davidson's Stephen Curry scored 25 points and {{was chosen as the}} Midwest Region's Most Outstanding Player.|$|E
25|$|Four days later, she {{contacted}} {{a convoy}} of three ships accompanied by two Fubuki-class destroyers. The submarine scored two hits on the coastal minelayer Nasami, which disappeared {{in a cloud of}} smoke and debris. The nearer destroyer began closing the range, and Trigger <b>missed</b> <b>it</b> with four aft tubes. She caught up with the convoy again and fired five torpedoes at the last ship. Two hits produced flames that reached mast height and several secondary explosions that marked the end of the 11,933-ton converted submarine tender Yasukuni Maru. Over three weeks later, the submarine terminated the patrol when she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 23 February.|$|E
25|$|The county {{team was}} at a low ebb and Dooland had the {{responsibility}} {{of being the first}} overseas import brought in specifically to strengthen the team. He played for them from 1953 to 1957, scoring 4,782 runs at an average of 24.52 and taking 770 wickets at 18.86. He completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a season twice and in another season <b>missed</b> <b>it</b> by only 30 runs. He took 16 for 83 in the match against Essex at Trent Bridge in 1954 and his total of 181 wickets for Nottinghamshire that season remains the club's record. Following his departure, Notts had their worst-ever period in terms of results.|$|E

25|$|Offenders are {{generally}} required {{to submit a}} monthly supervision report within the first five days of the month to the U.S. Probation office. The report asks about employment; vehicles; finances (including bank accounts, past due debts, cash inflows and outflows, major expenditures, post office boxes, safe deposit boxes, and storage units); questionings by law enforcement; arrests; dispositions of charges; contacts with others who have criminal records; firearm possession and/or access; illegal drug use and/or possession; travel outside the probation district; special assessments, restitution, and fine balances and payments; community service obligations and hours completed, missed, and remaining; and drug, alcohol, and mental health aftercare and any sessions <b>missed.</b> <b>It</b> is a class D felony to make a false statement on this report.|$|E
25|$|George Hardy {{began working}} as a janitor at the main branch of the San Francisco Public Library in 1935. One night, a foreman dropped a match behind a radiator; when Hardy <b>missed</b> <b>it,</b> he was fired. Angry at the pettiness and mistreatment, Hardy, his father and other Irish janitors formed a new local for office {{building}} janitors, Local 87. George Hardy became an organizer for the new union in 1936. Hardy worked by day, and by night (often not sleeping for several days) he organized workers into the new union. Repeatedly fired for his off-hours union work, Hardy was blacklisted. Under future leaders such as Herman Eimers Rex Kennedy, and Robert Parr, members of Local 87 continued to enjoy improved wages, benefits and working conditions. These victories were all won with very few strikes.|$|E
25|$|The Bucs were {{predicted}} {{by many as}} an underdog by several sports commentators to defeat the 3–1 Bengals, and they pulled off an upset win, with Bruce Gradkowski throwing 2 touchdowns, and Cadillac Williams running for 94 yards. With 34 seconds remaining in the 4th quarter, Gradkowkski threw a pass to wide receiver Michael Clayton, who appeared to cross the goal line in a dive, but dropped the football in the end zone. The pass was initially ruled incomplete. The replay official initiated a review, and referee Mike Carey determined that Clayton had possession of the football when he crossed the plain of the goal line. The call was reversed, and the Buccaneers were awarded the touchdown. At the end of regulation, Shayne Graham {{had a chance to}} win the game with a 62-yard field goal, but <b>missed</b> <b>it</b> wide right, giving the Bucs their first win of 2006.|$|E
