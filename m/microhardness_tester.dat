The total case depth is the true depth of the case. For most alloys, the effective case depth is {{the depth of the}} case that has a hardness equivalent of HRC50; however, some alloys specify a different hardness (40-60 HRC) at effective case depth; this is checked on a Tukon <b>microhardness</b> <b>tester.</b> This value can be roughly approximated as 65% of the total case depth; however the chemical composition and hardenability can affect this approximation.

5000|$|Scratch {{tests at}} low loads, {{such as the}} Bierbaum microcharacter test, {{performed}} with either 3 gf or 9 gf loads, preceded the development of <b>microhardness</b> <b>testers</b> using traditional indenters. In 1925, Smith and Sandland of the UK developed an indentation test that employed a square-based pyramidal indenter made from diamond. They chose the pyramidal shape with an angle of 136° between opposite faces {{in order to obtain}} hardness numbers that would be {{as close as possible to}} Brinell hardness numbers for the specimen. The Vickers test has a great advantage of using one hardness scale to test all materials.The first reference to the Vickers indenter with low loads was made in the annual report of the National Physical Laboratory in 1932. Lips and Sack describes the first Vickers tester using low loads in 1936. There is some disagreement in the literature regarding the load range applicable to microhardness testing. ASTM Specification E384, for example, states that the load range for microhardness testing is 1 to 1000 gf. For loads of 1 kgf and below, the Vickers hardness (HV) is calculated with an equation, wherein load (L) is in grams force and the mean of two diagonals (d) is in millimeters: ...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} characterization {{project was}} undertaken by Velan, an international industrial valve designer and manufacturer, {{in collaboration with}} the National Research Council of Canada, Boucherville, and Polytechnique Montr 9 al. The purpose was to assess the mechanical and tribological resistances of promising ceramic coatings for hydrometallurgy applications, including a novel n-TiO 2 ̆ 082 -Cr 2 ̆ 082 O 2 ̆ 083 blend. Hardness and shear strength were determined using <b>microhardness</b> indentation <b>testers</b> and universal tensile testing equipment. Wear resistance of the coatings under sliding wear, abrasion, and galling conditions were measured by standard pin-on-disk tests, abrasion tests, and custom-designed galling tests. The main result is that the synergy between Cr 2 ̆ 082 O 2 ̆ 083 and n-TiO 2 ̆ 082 produced abrasion performance exceeding that of these materials alone. Also, an optimized balance between the hard and brittle Cr 2 ̆ 082 O 2 ̆ 083 phases and the soft and ductile n-TiO 2 ̆ 082 phases resulted in higher abrasion, sliding, and galling resistance. The novel n-TiO 2 ̆ 082 -Cr 2 ̆ 082 O 2 ̆ 083 blend is therefore considered as a promising evolution of the current TiO 2 ̆ 082 -Cr 2 ̆ 0822 O 2 ̆ 0833 blend.
