40|$|With {{the continual}} {{miniaturization}} of interconnections on printed circuit boards, {{the use of}} <b>micro-attachment</b> {{is becoming more and}} more popular. The use of semiconductors and multichip modules are now quite commonplace and as a result the practice of wire bonding is now being employed on many assemblies. Historically the accepted pad finish used for successful wire bonding has been either electroplated gold over nickel or electroless nickel followed by immersion gold. With the industry trend to use more of this technology, both circuit board assemblers and board fabricators have been searching for lower cost alternatives. Along with the gaining popularity of direct chip attachment, the utilization of ultra fine pitch devices has pressed the limits of Hot Air Solder Leveling to provide flat, planar surfaces for consistent component placement and reliable assembly. This paper discusses the feasibility of using an immersion organo-metallic silver coating as an alternative to nickel/gold for wire bonding applications as well as providing an excellent finish for surface mounting and typical through hole assembly. The test results for solderability and demonstrated wire bond performance are discussed for the circuit board assembler. The process chemistry and the process advantages are also detailed for the board fabricator. These include increased yields, reduced costs and the elimination of solder mask incompatibility issues that are associated with nickel/gold processes...|$|E

One way is using a soft brush to lightly dust the object, dislodging dust and debris. To remove surface dust a variable speed vacuum, soft lint-free cloths, vinyl eraser crumbs, volcanized rubber sponges, and <b>micro-attachments</b> are also tools that can be utilized.|$|R
