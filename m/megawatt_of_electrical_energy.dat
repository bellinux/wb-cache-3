50|$|Sheffield has a District Energy {{system that}} {{exploits}} the city's domestic waste, by incinerating it and converting the energy from it to electricity. It also provides hot water, which is distributed through over 25 mi of pipes under the city, via two networks. These networks supply heat and {{hot water for}} many buildings throughout the city. These include not only cinemas, hospitals, shops and offices, but also universities (Sheffield Hallam University and the University of Sheffield), and residential properties. Energy generated in a waste plant produces 60 <b>megawatts</b> <b>of</b> thermal energy and up to 19 <b>megawatts</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> from 225,000 tonnes of waste.|$|R
5000|$|The Shah had set {{the target}} <b>of</b> {{producing}} 23,000 <b>Megawatts</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> from nuclear sources within the next twenty years. In July 1974, a nuclear deal worth US$130 million was signed between Iran and United States. He had once asked the Shah {{if he wanted to}} build a nuclear bomb, to which the Shah replied that doing so would only isolate Iran {{from the rest of the}} world. In October 1975, he refused that Iran had signed a uranium deal worth US$7 million with South Africa. After he was accused of mismanagement and embezzlement in October 1978, he resigned from the post of the president of the Atomic Energy Organization. After the 1979 Iranian revolution that led to the formation of a new government, Etemad left Iran for Paris. The new leaders asked him to return but he refused. During the Gulf War, Saddam Hussein attempted to persuade him to work for Iraq but he refused saying [...] "'as long as you are fighting my people I wouldn't come to Iraq. You are my enemy".|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 Micro gas-turbines are {{expanding}} {{to be much}} more prevalent in the power generating market. They are merely scaled down versions of their larger siblings, gas-turbines powering commercial airplanes on generating <b>megawatts</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> throughout the world. The basic components of a micro gas-turbine and that of a turbocharger unit on internal combustion engines are quite similar. Both have a compressor, a heat source and a turbine. This study investigates the possibility of using a commercial turbocharger, designed for use on internal combustion engines, to function as a micro gas-turbine. The literature study discusses the components that make up a typical gas-turbine. Importantly, the literature explains the principles of operation and thermodynamic and/or mechanical relevance in a gas-turbine. Furthermore, the study shows a hand calculation procedure in order to calculate the excess power available from a turbocharger based on a fixed turbine inlet temperature, calculating the excess power for four different turbocharger Units. After the compressor and turbine characteristics are imported into FLOWNEX (a network solving software package) to recalculate the excess power, the results are compared with the results of the hand calculation. A specific turbocharger is selected to incorporate into a recuperated open cycle gas-turbine simulation. The cycle is firstly calculated by hand after which it is simulated in the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) to facilitate ease of modifications to the input parameters. The results from the cycle simulation are then compared to preferred system parameters. The conclusion is then made that a turbocharger is thermodynamically suitable to function as the core element of a microgas- turbine. Master...|$|R
40|$|Flow {{batteries}} are a promising technology for storing and discharging <b>megawatt</b> hours <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> {{on the time}} scale of hours. The separator between {{the positive and negative}} electrodes strongly affects technical and economic performance. However, requirements for separators have not been reported in a general manner that enables quantitative evaluation of new systems such as nonaqueous flow batteries. This gap is addressed by deriving specifications for transport properties that are chemistry agnostic and align with aggressive capital cost targets. Three key transport characteristics are identified: area-specific resistance RΩ, crossover current density ix, and the coupling between crossover and capacity loss Ψ. Suggested maximum area-specific resistances are 0. 29 and 2. 3 Ω·cm[superscript 2] for aqueous and nonaqueous batteries, respectively. Allowable crossover rates are derived by considering the possible fates of active molecules that cross the separator and the coupling between Coulombic efficiency (CE) and capacity decline. The CE must exceed 99. 992 % when active species are unstable at the opposing electrode, while a CE of 97 % can be tolerated when active molecules can be recovered from the opposing electrode. The contributions of diffusion, migration, and convection are discussed, quantified, and related to the physical properties of the separator and the active materials. United States.
