2500|$|Since Einstein rarely defended {{himself against}} these attacks, this task was {{undertaken}} by other relativity theoreticians, who (according to Hentschel) formed {{some sort of}} [...] "defensive belt" [...] around Einstein. Some representatives were Max von Laue, Max Born, etc. and on popular-scientific and philosophical level Hans Reichenbach, André Metz etc., who led many discussions with critics in semi-popular journals and newspapers. However, most of these discussions failed from the start. Physicists like Gehrcke, some philosophers, and the [...] "free researchers" [...] were so obsessed with their own ideas and prejudices that {{they were unable to}} grasp the basics of relativity; consequently, the participants of the discussions were talking past each other. In fact, the theory that was criticized by them was not relativity at all, but rather a caricature of it. The [...] "free researchers" [...] were mostly ignored by the scientific community, but also, in time, respected physicists such as Lenard and Gehrcke found themselves in a position outside the scientific community. However, the critics didn't believe that this was due to their incorrect theories, but rather due to a conspiracy of the relativistic physicists (and in the 1920s & 1930s of the Jews as well), which allegedly tried to put down the critics, and to preserve and improve their own positions within the academic world. For example, Gehrcke (1920/24) held that the propagation of relativity is a product of some sort of mass suggestion. Therefore, he instructed a <b>media</b> <b>monitoring</b> service to collect over 5000 newspaper clippings which were related to relativity, and published his findings in a book. However, Gehrcke's claims were rejected, because the simple existence of the [...] "relativity hype" [...] says nothing about the validity of the theory, and thus it cannot used for or against relativity.|$|E
