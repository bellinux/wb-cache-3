40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{we study}} the {{effectiveness}} of information retraction in situations where information being spread requires recipients {{to make a decision}} or take an action. Consider the scenario where information is introduced into a network, advising recipients to take an action. If at a later time, the information is found to be inaccurate and the action is unnecessary, it becomes a concern to cease the information from spreading any further and stop people from taking the action. The spread of inaccurate information can lead to confusion and mistrust, and therefore {{it is important to be}} able to quickly impede or retract inaccurate information, if needed to at a later time. We investigate the idea of introducing <b>counter</b> <b>messages</b> into a network to interfere with an ongoing diffusion and stop the action that was prescribed by the previous <b>messages.</b> These <b>counter</b> <b>messages</b> are diffusive themselves and may spread through the network based on the recipient’s evaluation of the information.

In the early 1940s the monarchist pressure started to mount. The Alfonsist claimant Don Juan, who in 1941-1942 courted Hitler about overthrowing Franco and setting up an authoritarian monarchy, changed his strategy. Now converted to constitutionalism, in March 1943 he addressed Franco with a letter, denouncing the regime as provisional and urging swift monarchical restoration; the response read that restoration based on dynastical or political continuity {{was out of the}} question. In June Franco received the most direct challenge so far, when 26 Cortes deputies signed a letter recommending that traditional state institutions be re-introduced.

The thesis presents the operation of a robot welding cell project, which was developed at YASKAWA Ristro d. o. o. for the customer Akrapovič. The sub systems of the robot welding cell will be detailed in the thesis including the following topics; safety control, robot operation, Siemens PLC and the communication between these systems. Development of the PLC program controlling the robot welding cells will also be covered in detail. The PLC program is written ladder diagrams in the Siemens Simatic S 7 platform. The safety controller and associated systems are also discussed, which are in place {{to ensure the safety}} of the human operator. The process of developing software for a robot welding cell begins with detailed analysis of the electrical drawings and customer requirements. Programming the safety controller can be separated into three steps. First, the inputs are defined, followed by developing the safety logic and finally output elements are connected to the logic. The safety logic is the key to programming the automatic operation of the robot welding cell as it ensures safe operation only after certain safety conditions are met. Programming the automation sequence in S 7 begins with defining the symbol table before any actual programming takes place. Programming covers communication, <b>messages,</b> <b>counters,</b> alarms, work selection and the HMI. ...|$|R

40|$|Critical interpretive {{research}} explores hidden power relationships which influence communicative {{behavior of}} non-dominant groups, requiring researchers {{to get at}} the meaning behind the meaning (Thomas, 1993). 2 ̆ 2 The root of African American difficulty is directly related to skin color, 2 ̆ 2 stated writer James Baldwin (quoted in Hall, 2000, p. 173). This 2 ̆ 2 root 2 ̆ 2 is exposed through colorized beauty hierarchies. To examine the communicative impact of cultural dominance on cultural identities of marginalized groups, this study interviewed thirty-eight Black females, exploring the impact of race on Black female beauty perceptions. Cultural contracts theory was used to understand the identity negotiation process. Both raced and gendered, exploring Black female beauty warrants exploring both hair and skin color issues. This study sought an understanding of what makes some Black women conform to, while others resist, dominant cultural beauty standards? Three research questions explored dominant beauty messages, the impact of those messages, and management of messages. Eurocentric beauty messages that devalue dark skin and short/coarse hair are communicated to Black females via family, male/female peers, educational and social institutions, mass media images and corporate employment practices. Inter-cultural racialized beauty messages produce intra-cultural colorized beauty hierarchies that divide Black females and negatively impact socio-economic conditions of darker-skinned females. Four racialized/colorized beauty parallels of privilege/de-privilege, stereotypes, tensions, and an evolution for change emerged. Examining identities of 2 ̆ 2 mixed 2 ̆ 2 Black females who most often fit within dominant beauty paradigms produced identity confusion and beauty contradictions. These females shared their 2 ̆ 2 bad 2 ̆ 2 experiences with 2 ̆ 2 good 2 ̆ 2 hair, and their experiences of being treated like trophies by males and novelties by females. The study showed that younger, Black females are more accepting of dominant beauty messages. An examination of hairstyle preferences determined that {{the presence or absence of}} 2 ̆ 2 straightened 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 natural 2 ̆ 2 hairstyles do not necessarily reflect identity.

This study examines the association between scanned information, trust in health information sources and vaccine safety concerns among African American, Mexican American, and non-Hispanic White women. Methods Women (N= 761) in Los Angeles County were sampled via random digit dial and surveyed regarding use of and trust in health information resources and vaccine safety concerns.

40|$|Background. A {{relatively}} simple procedure, the Pap test, {{is effective in}} detecting early changes in the cervix; however, many at-fisk women, even in developed countries, do not have regular Pap tests. Methods. A randomized controlled trial of an interactive voice response (IVR) cervical screening brief advice involving 17, 008 households is described. The IVR system automatically made calls to households and explained {{the nature of the}} call; selected one eligible woman aged 18 - 69 years; determined her screening status; delivered a message appropriate to her screening status; offered additional <b>messages</b> to <b>counter</b> common barriers; offered additional information on cervical screening and cancer; offered additional contact numbers; and offered to arrange for someone to call back. Cervical screening rate data were obtained from the Australian Health Insurance Commission (HIC) for 6 months before and following the intervention. Results. The cervical screening rate was found to have increased by 0. 43 % in intervention compared to the control postcodes, and the increase was greater for older women at 1. 34 %. Conclusions. The overall conclusion was that IVR technology was a feasible means to contact women to deliver brief interventions aimed at increasing cervical screening rates and could economically target at-fisk groups. The potential for linking IVR to centralized Pap test Registers to issue Pap test reminders should be explored. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

Deadlocks {{can be caused by}} routing cycles in the network, or by message dependencies, even if the network itself is actually free of routing cycles. Two basic approaches to <b>counter</b> <b>message</b> dependent deadlocks exist: deadlock avoidance, which is most popular in NoCs, and deadlock recovery, which has until now only been used in parallel computer networks. Deadlock recovery promises low buffer space requirements and does not impose restrictions on connections between individual communication partners.

The results show significant buffer space savings for deadlock recovery, however, at the cost of reduced data throughput.
