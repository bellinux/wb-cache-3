5|$|The Hall of Ambassadors ("Sala dos Embaixadores"), {{sometimes}} called the throne room or the Hall of Mirrors, was designed by Robillon in 1757 {{and is one of}} the largest reception rooms in the palace. This long low room has a ceiling painted by Francisco de Melo which depicts the Portuguese royal family attending a concert during the reign of Queen Maria I. The room is extremely wide and light, spanning the full width of the palace, with tall windows on both sides. Between each window is a semi-circular gilt console table above which are pier glasses adorned with crystal sconces. The throne dais, set in an apse, is flanked by gilded and mirrored columns, and the floor is a chequer board pattern of black and white <b>marble</b> <b>tiles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some of Belton's many {{rooms have}} been altered {{over the last}} 300 years both in use and design. One of the {{principal}} rooms, the Marble Hall (1), {{the first of the}} large reception rooms, serves as an entrance hall from the south entrance, and takes its name from a chequer board patterned floor of black and white <b>marble</b> <b>tiles.</b> By the time of Belton's conception, the great hall was no longer a place for the household to eat, but intended as a grand entrance to the house. The hall was originally hung with 28 portraits of Kings, Queens, and Emperors, from William the Conqueror to William III, intended to give the house an air of dynastic importance. The less numerous and far newer Brownlow family portraits were originally hung in the Great Dining Room immediately above. The room is fully panelled, and parts of the panelling contain lime wood embellishments attributed to Grinling Gibbons. In the early 19th century, this room, and some others, were re-modelled by Jeffry Wyatville, who in addition to graining and painting the panelling to imitate oak installed new doors.|$|E

The lobby extends from the front back to the courtyard and is floored with diagonally laid gray and white <b>marble</b> <b>tiles.</b> The walls, as are old walls in the building, are plastered, and the ceiling has exposed 4x10 beaded ausubo wood beams. Old double four-paneled doors and a transom open to the courtyard. The window in the stairhall has been filled in with glass brick.|$|E

25|$|Mosaic was {{a common}} form of {{decoration}} throughout the Roman Empire and because of its durability was usually applied to floors, where it was at first executed in pebbles or small <b>marble</b> <b>tiles.</b> During the Early Christian period glass tiles were used extensively for wall and vault decorations, the vault of the Mausoleum of Santa Costanza in Rome being {{a fine example of}} decorative, non-narrative Christian mosaic. A perhaps unique example of Late Roman pictorial mosaic is the magnificent apsidal mosaic of the Church of Santa Pudenziana. The nearby church, dedicated to her sister Santa Prassede, has mosaics which are Byzantine in style.|$|E
25|$|After the {{annexation}} of Mandalay by the British in 1885, the walled city with Mandalay Palace became Fort Dufferin, and troops were billeted all around Mandalay Hill in the monasteries, temples and pagodas. They became off-limits {{to the public}} and Burmese were no longer allowed to visit their religious sites. One revenue surveyor called U Aung Ban then {{came up with the idea}} of appealing direct to Queen Victoria since she had promised to respect all religions practised by her subjects. To their amazement and great joy the British queen promptly ordered the withdrawal of all her troops from religious precincts in 1890. This however turned to great sadness when they found that the pagoda had been looted from the hti, left lying on the ground stripped of its bells, gold, silver, diamonds, rubies and other precious stones, down to the Italian <b>marble</b> <b>tiles</b> from its terraces. The zayats lay in utter ruin and the bricks had been used to build a road for the troops. All the brass bells from all the kyauksa gu stupas were gone, 9 on each making it 6570 in total. The gold ink from the letters as well as the sides and top of each marble slab had also disappeared. All the biloos along the corridors had lost their heads, and the marble eyes and claws from the masonry chinthes gone.|$|E

Behind all its highly elaborated decoration, with European Baroque influence, essentially the structure is Neo-Classic in style, making a unique and yet elegant combination of both styles. The building rests on a rusticated stone podium; its facades and main walls are of brick masonry with some interior partitions and walls of the gallery and kitchen in wood. Wooden beams supports a galvanized zinc roof. The windows and doors of the building are wooden with movable louvers and fixed colored glass inlets. A variety of flooring material is used throughout the house: from native cement-colored tiles in the dining area and vestibule, 1" [...] by 6" [...] tongue-and-groove wood slats in the living area and bedrooms, and ceramic tiles in the bathroom, to <b>marble</b> <b>tiles</b> at the entry-way.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{addition}} of annexes, {{the interior of the}} Panagia Episkopi has a number of larger and smaller rooms, which gives the church a labyrinthine appearance. The floor is covered with <b>marble</b> <b>tiles</b> of various sizes. A relatively low Synthronon is integrated into the apse. In front of {{the west side of the}} central church area there is an entrance hall (Narthex), that extends the full width of the church. Originally there were, besides the main entrance in the Western wall of the church, two side entrances; one to the North and one to the South. [...] The southern part of the Narthex was, however, separated from the interior part of the church, and now exists as a small secondary room, and is only accessible from outside, through the southern entrance. In the southeast, the interior corner of the cross shape is filled out by an annex, which was built in 1767 to settle a dispute between Roman and Orthodox Christians, and was broken through to the chancel, so that it could serve as a chapel for the Roman Catholics of the island.|$|E
2500|$|The {{functions}} of the temple mainly concentrated on the cella, the [...] "dwelling" [...] of the cult statue. The elaboration of the temple's external aspects served to stress {{the dignity of the}} cella. In contrast, the cella itself was often finished with some moderation. The only source of light for cella and cult statue was the cellas frontal door. Thus, the interior only received a limited amount of light. Exceptions are found in the temples of Apollo at Bassae and of Athena at Tegea, where the southern cella wall had a door, potentially allowing more light into the interior. A special situation applies to the temples of the Cyclades, where the roof was usually of <b>marble</b> <b>tiles.</b> Marble roofs also covered the temple of Zeus at Olympia and the Parthenon at Athens. As marble is not entirely opaque, those cellas may have been permeated with a distinctive diffused light. For cultic reasons, but also to use the light of the rising sun, virtually all Greek temples were oriented to the east. Some exceptions existed, e.g. the west-facing temples of Artemis at Ephesos and at Magnesia on the Maeander, or the north-south oriented temples of Arcadia. Such exceptions are probably connected with cult practice. Study of the soils around temple sites, is evidence that temple sites were chosen with regard to particular deities: for example, amid arable soils for the agricultural deities Dionysos and Demeter, and near rocky soils for the hunter gatherer deities Apollo and Artemis.|$|E

A number of items were salvaged from the bank rotunda and retained or repurposed during the conversion to a grocery store. [...] In the basement, the four vaults were repurposed into a nightclub, and the iron gate which closed off the vault areas used as the main entrance to the bar. The former main vault became the Bourbon Room, which was decorated with disused safe deposit box covers and keys as well as gears from vault doors. On the second floor, the intricate bronze railing was retained, and the cast terrazzo cloakroom counter was repurposed {{for use by the}} wine shop. The marble teller's counters on the first floor were repurposed as circular tables for the café and wine shop. The <b>marble</b> <b>tiles</b> on the second floor, which at some point had been covered with carpeting, were rediscovered and reused as well. Other architectural elements were restored to close to their original beauty. The bronze brackets and coffers on the first floor had been covered, and soffits added to the second floor ceiling in 1972 to accommodate new HVAC ducts. The soffits lowered the ceiling a full , obscuring the windows. The brackets and coffers were uncovered and restored, and the soffits and ductwork removed. The marble cladding on the rotunda columns and the original first floor flooring were also retained. Also retained was the bronze Cleveland Trust Company seal embedded in the floor of the ground level.|$|E

The high-frequency (HF) component of HRV, which reflected parasympathetic nervous activity, and the low-frequency (LF) /HF ratio, which reflected sympathetic nervous activity, were measured. Plates of uncoated white oak, <b>marble,</b> <b>tile,</b> and stainless steel were used as tactile stimuli. After sitting at rest with their eyes closed, participants touched the materials for 90 s. As a result, tactile stimulation with white oak significantly (1) decreased the oxy-Hb concentration in the left/right prefrontal cortex relative to <b>marble,</b> <b>tile,</b> and stainless steel and (2) increased ln(HF) -reflected parasympathetic nervous activity relative to marble and stainless steel.
