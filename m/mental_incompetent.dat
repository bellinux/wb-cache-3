40|$|Pursuant to Rule 24 (j) of the Rules of the Supreme Court, {{respondents}} Veasy, Bowman and {{the hospital}} entities hereby advise the Court of a decision which has recently come to counsels 2 ̆ 7 attention. The argument beginning on page 22 of the Respondents 1 Brief, 2 ̆ 2 IV. Section 78 - 14 - 4 is a Constitutionally Permissible Enactment 2 ̆ 2, should be supplemented with the following citation: Douglas v. Hugh A. Stallings, M. D., Inc., 87 0 F. 2 d 1242 (7 th Cir. 1989) (limits imposed on a brain damaged minor by the malpractice statute of limitations are rationally related to the goals of preventing stale claims and controlling the cost of medical care; the state need not provide a tolling provision for minority and <b>mental</b> <b>incompetents</b> or a discovery rule in order to comply with due process guarantees) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{constitution}} of Iran combines concepts of both democracy and theocracy, theocracy {{in the form}} of Khomeini's concept of vilayat-e faqih (Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist), as expressed in the Islamic Republic. According to Ayatollah Khomeini, the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist was not restricted to orphans or <b>mental</b> <b>incompetents,</b> but applied to everyone in absence of the twelfth Imam. Jurists were the only rightful political/governmental leaders because [...] "God had commanded Islamic government" [...] and [...] "no one knew religion better than the ulama" [...] (Islamic clergy). They alone would preserve [...] "Islamic order" [...] and keep everyone from deviating from [...] "the just path of Islam". Prior to the revolution observant Shia Muslims selected their own leading faqih to emulate (known as a Marja'-i taqlid) according to their own decision making. The “congregation rather than the hierarchy decided how prominent the ayatollah was” thus allowing the public to possibly limit the influence of the Faqih.|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{concerning}} eyewitness testimony {{given by}} people with mental retardation in court was reviewed. Despite general perceptions that people with <b>mental</b> retardation make <b>incompetent</b> witnesses, available evidence suggests that they can provide accurate accounts of witnessed events. The accounts are usually less complete than those provided by the general population and are greatly influenced by the methods of questioning. The sparse available evidence suggests that cross-examination methods may lead to memory distortion. The use of closed, complex, and leading questions {{and the absence of}} aids to recall may have a particularly adverse effect on people with mental retardation. Resulting errors could lead to a false conviction or acquittal. Future policy and research in this much neglected area were discussed...|$|R
40|$|This essay reviews Allan Farnsworth 2 ̆ 7 s final book, Alleviating Mistakes: Reversal and Forgiveness for Flawed Perceptions (Oxford U. Press 2004). There {{are many}} kinds of mistakes. One kind - a rational, well-intended {{decision}} or act that results in unanticipated, negative consequences - was the principal subject of Allan Farnsworth 2 ̆ 7 s previous foray {{into the realm of}} contractual angst: Changing Your Mind: The Law of Regretted Decisions (Yale U. Press 1998). Another kind - the subject of this book - is a mistake caused by an inaccurate, incomplete, or <b>incompetent</b> <b>mental</b> state at the time of an act or decision that results in unanticipated, negative consequences. Interweaving literary and operatic illustrations with discussions of cases, statutes, doctrinal and theoretical scholarship, the Model Penal Code, the Restatements of Contracts, Property, Restitution and Unjust Enrichment, and Torts, and insights from psychology and philosophy, Farnsworth 2 ̆ 7 s exploration of alleviating and inculpating mistakes (both involve the same mechanism, the difference is the legal consequence that follows) delves into how contract, criminal, and tort law, and equity deal with factual and legal mistakes, the rationale for each substantive body of law 2 ̆ 7 s similar or dissimilar treatment of various types of mistakes, and how judicial and jurisprudential attitudes toward mistakes have evolved over time...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{credibility}} and faking {{is essential in}} different areas of psychology {{and especially in the}} forensic field. The investigations performed by Arce and Farina are recognised as being among the most notable of all the existing investigations, with the development of the Global Evaluation System (GES) that {{has been found to be}} especially effective in assessing the credibility of testimony and malingering mental health cases. The application of this procedure to 20 people accused under the judicial system of Social Security fraud for malingering a permanent work incapacity by way of a mental disorder, showed that the procedure described in the GES was effective for the correct classification of the malingers. Furthermore, data supported the categorising of malingers, consisting of whole malingers (those mentally healthy that effectively simulate a permanent work incapacity), partial malingers (those with temporary or no mental work incapacity disease, who claim for a permanent work incapacity), over malingers (those with permanent work incapacity mental disorders who exaggerate the severity of their <b>mental</b> health) and <b>incompetent</b> malingers (those who claimed to have permanent work incapacity but in their mental health assessment, were observed to have no mental health disorder.). Protocols for the forensic evaluation of malingering fitted to each categorization derived from the results obtained. The theoretical and practical implications of forensic assessment are discussed...|$|R
