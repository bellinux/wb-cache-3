5|$|Other {{ichthyosaur}} remains {{had been}} discovered in years past at Lyme and elsewhere, but the specimen found by the Annings {{was the first to}} come to the attention of scientific circles in London. It was purchased by the lord of a local manor, who passed it to William Bullock for public display in London where it created a sensation. At a time when most people in Britain still believed in a literal interpretation of Genesis, that the Earth was only a few thousand years old and that species did not evolve or become extinct, the find raised questions in scientific and religious circles about what the new science of geology was revealing about ancient life and the history of the Earth. Its notoriety increased when Sir Everard Home wrote a series of six papers, starting in 1814, describing it for the Royal Society. The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil, and in the first one he even mistakenly credited the painstaking cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock's museum. Perplexed by the creature, Home kept changing his mind about its classification, first thinking {{it was a kind of}} fish, then thinking it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> kind of affinity with the duck-billed platypus (only recently known to science); finally in 1819 he reasoned it might be a kind of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards, which led him to propose naming it Proteo-Saurus. By then Charles Konig, an assistant curator of the British Museum, had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus (fish lizard) for the specimen and that name stuck. Konig purchased the skeleton for the museum in 1819. The skull of the specimen is still in the possession of the Natural History Museum in London (to which the fossil collections of the British Museum were transferred later in the century), but at some point, it became separated from the rest of the skeleton, the location of which is not known.|$|E

25|$|Evidence that synephrine <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> central effects {{comes from}} the {{research}} of Song and co-workers, who studied the effects of synephrine in mouse models of anti-depressant activity. These researchers observed that oral doses of 0.3 – 10mg/kg of racemic syephrine were effective in shortening the duration of immobility produced in the assays, but did not cause any changes in spontaneous motor activity in separate tests. This characteristic immobility could be counteracted by the pre-administration of prazosin.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it is not}} yet well understood, IgE {{may play}} an {{important}} role in the immune system’s recognition of cancer, in which the stimulation of a strong cytotoxic response against cells displaying only small amounts of early cancer markers would be beneficial. If this were the case, anti-IgE treatments such as omalizumab (for allergies) <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> undesirable side effects. However, a recent study, which was performed based on pooled analysis using comprehensive data from 67 phase I to IV clinical trials of omalizumab in various indications, concluded that a causal relationship between omalizumab therapy and malignancy is unlikely.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{controversy}} over who exactly should {{take responsibility for}} coordinating {{the care of the}} dual eligibles. There have been some proposals to transfer dual eligibles into existing Medicaid managed care plans, which are controlled by individual states. But many states facing severe budget shortfalls <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> incentive to stint on necessary care or otherwise shift costs to enrollees and their families to capture some Medicaid savings. Medicare has more experience managing the care of older adults, and is already expanding coordinated care programs under the ACA, though there are some questions about private Medicare plans’ capacity to manage care and achieve meaningful cost savings.|$|E

25|$|The {{other form}} of {{activity}} during sleep is reactivation. Some electrophysiological {{studies have shown that}} neuronal activity patterns found during a learning task before sleep are reactivated in the brain during sleep. This, along with the coincidence of active areas with areas responsible for memory have led to the theory that sleep <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> memory consolidation functions. In this relation, some studies have shown that after a sequential motor task, the pre-motor and visual cortex areas involved are most active during REM sleep, but not during NREM. Similarly, the hippocampal areas involved in spatial learning tasks are reactivated in NREM sleep, but not in REM. Such studies suggest a role of sleep in consolidation of specific memory types. It is, however, still unclear whether other types of memory are also consolidated by these mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{has been}} shown to inhibit steroid 11β-hydroxylase, an enzyme that is {{essential}} for the production of the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol. Because of this, glucocorticoid levels might be expected to be lowered, and hence, spironolactone <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> antiglucocorticoidic effects. In clinical practice, however, this has not been found to be the case; spironolactone has actually been found to increase cortisol levels, both with acute and chronic administration. Research has shown that this is due to antagonism of the MR, which suppresses negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis positively regulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn signals the adrenal glands, the major source of corticosteroid biosynthesis in the body, to increase production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. Therefore, by antagonizing the MR, spironolactone causes an increase in ACTH secretion and by extension an indirect rise in cortisol levels. As such, any antiglucocorticoid activity of spironolactone via direct suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis (at the level of the adrenals) appears to be more than fully offset by its concurrent indirect stimulatory effects on glucocorticoid production.|$|E

500|$|Aside from Russian, Lenin {{spoke and}} read French, German, and English. Concerned with {{physical}} fitness, he exercised regularly, enjoyed cycling, swimming, and hunting, and {{also developed a}} passion for mountain walking in the Swiss peaks. He was also fond of pets, in particular cats. Tending to eschew luxury, he lived a spartan lifestyle, and Pipes noted that Lenin was [...] "exceedingly modest in his personal wants", leading [...] "an austere, almost ascetic, style of life". Lenin despised untidiness, always keeping his work desk tidy and his pencils sharpened, and insisted on total silence while he was working. According to Fischer, Lenin's [...] "vanity was minimal", {{and for this reason}} he disliked the cult of personality that the Soviet administration began to build around him; he nevertheless accepted that it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> benefits in unifying the communist movement.|$|E
500|$|The British in late 1779 {{embarked}} on a new strategy {{based on the assumption}} that most Southerners were Loyalists at heart. [...] General Clinton withdrew the British garrison from Newport, and marshalled a force of more than 10,000 men that in the first half of 1780 successfully besieged Charleston, South Carolina. [...] In June 1780 he captured over 5,000 Continental soldiers and militia in the single worst defeat of the war for the Americans. [...] Washington had at the end of March pessimistically dispatched several regiments troops southward from his army, hoping they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> effect in what he saw as a looming disaster. [...] He also ordered troops stationed in Virginia and North Carolina south, but these were either captured at Charleston, or scattered later at Waxhaws and Camden. [...] Camden saw the ignominious defeat of General Gates, who had been appointed to the southern command by Congress without Washington's advice or knowledge beforehand. [...] Gates famously abandoned his army and retreated [...] by horse after his battle lines were broken. [...] The debacle ended Gates' career as a field officer, but he eluded formal inquiries into his behavior because of his political connections.|$|E
500|$|MacGregor {{went into}} {{hiding in the}} French provinces, while Lehuby fled to the {{southern}} Netherlands. Hippisley and Irving were informed on 6 September {{that they were being}} investigated for conspiracy to defraud and sell titles to land they did not own. Both insisted that they were innocent. They were taken that evening to La Force Prison. MacGregor was arrested after three months and brought to La Force on 7 December 1825. He speculated to his confederates that the charges against them must be the result of some abrupt change of policy by France, or of some Spanish intrigue calculated to undermine Poyaisian independence. The three men remained imprisoned without trial while the French attempted to extradite Lehuby from the Netherlands. Attempting to re-associate himself and Poyais with the republican movement in Latin America, MacGregor issued a French-language declaration from his prison cell on 10 January 1826, claiming that he was [...] "contrary to human rights, held prisoner... for reasons of which he is not aware" [...] and [...] "suffering as {{one of the founders of}} independence in the New World". This attempt to convince the French that he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> kind of diplomatic immunity did not work. The French government and police simply ignored the announcement.|$|E

500|$|Following {{an advance}} {{screening}} at CinemaCon on April 22, 2015, {{the film was}} well received by audiences. Praise was aimed for its smart storyline, although some wondered whether the concept was too complicated for young audiences and to attract family crowds.

Peter Debruge of Variety was effusive, calling it the studio's [...] "greatest idea" [...] and [...] "a stunningly original concept that [...] promises to forever change the way people think about the way people think." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips called it the studio's best since Up (also directed by Docter), a [...] "consistently inventive and a heartening corrective to recent, stockholder-driven inferiorities." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter deemed it an [...] "audacious concept" [...] that stands among the most [...] "conceptually trippy films" [...] for family audiences. [...] "With its quite literally cerebral bent, I think Inside Out <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> trouble fully connecting with younger kids, but grown-ups are likely to shed {{more than a few}} tears," [...] remarked Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair. The Guardians Peter Bradshaw felt it [...] "buoyant and sweet-natured," [...] though slightly inferior to Pixar's best. Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club, while overall positive on the film, said it [...] "trades the wordless gracefulness and sense of discovery of the animation studio's best work for explanatory voice-over and nonstop exposition," [...] also arguing that the Pixar animators could have been more visually adventurous to match the conceptual ambition.|$|E
