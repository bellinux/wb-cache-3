5|$|An avid cyclist, Bonds {{chose the}} {{activity}} to be a {{primary means of}} keeping in shape and great passion since his playing career. Because knee surgeries, back surgeries, and hip surgeries <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> more difficult to run, cycling has allowed him to engage in sufficient cardiovascular activity to help keep in shape. As {{a result of the}} cycling, he has lost 25 pounds from his final playing weight of 240 pounds.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{government}} in England had traditionally centred on several great offices of state, filled by powerful, independent {{members of the}} baronage. Henry abandoned this policy, leaving the post of justiciar vacant and turning the position of chancellor into a more junior role. A small royal council was formed but its role was ill-defined; appointments, patronage, and policy were decided personally by Henry and his immediate advisers, rather than through the larger councils that had marked his early years. The changes <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> harder for those outside Henry's inner circle to influence policy or to pursue legitimate grievances, particularly against the King's friends.|$|E
5|$|Fliegerkorps II sent 650 sorties against Pedestal from 11–14 August {{and claimed}} 12 {{aircraft}} shot down for 18 losses. Total Axis losses were 62 aircraft, 42 Italian and 19 German, including losses {{on the ground}} and those shot down by their own side. Royal Navy gunners and Fleet Air Arm fighters claimed 74 aircraft shot down but actually destroyed 42 Axis aircraft, 26 from the Regia Aeronautica and 16 Luftwaffe aircraft. The Fleet Air Arm lost thirteen aircraft on operations and sixteen Sea Hurricanes when Eagle was sunk, the RAF lost a Beaufighter and five Spitfires and a Sunderland was shot down by Giada. The Allies could not risk such losses again and another large convoy to Malta was not attempted until November 1942, when the re-capture of airfields in Egypt and Libya after the Second Battle of El Alamein <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> easier to provide land-based air cover.|$|E

50|$|The {{benefit of}} the new formula, a {{variation}} on the Gregory/Leibniz series (Pi/4 = arctan 1), was that it had a significantly increased rate of convergence, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> a <b>much</b> more practical method of calculation.|$|R
5|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, access to Padstow's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and the cliffs at Stepper Point, a {{difficult}} passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north-westerly gales when the cliffs would {{cut off the}} wind. Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar, despite the installation of mooring rings and capstans on the cliffs and quarrying away part of Stepper Point to improve the wind. In {{the early twentieth century}} the main channel moved away from the cliffs, and continued dredging has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> safer for boats, but deaths have occurred on the bar as recently as 1997.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{separate}} efforts {{to establish a}} Naval Academy football team in 1879. The first was guided by first-classman J.H. Robinson, who developed it as a training regiment {{to help keep the}} school's baseball team in shape. The team played the sport under rules that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> closer to soccer, where the players were permitted only to kick the ball in order to advance it. The second effort, headed by first-classman William John Maxwell was more successful in its efforts. Maxwell met with two of his friends, Tunstall Smith and Henry Woods, who played for the Baltimore Athletic Club and officially challenged their team to a game with the Naval Academy. A team was formed from academy first-classmen, which Maxwell led as a manager, trainer, and captain. The team would wake up and practice before reveille and following drill and meals. The squad received encouragement from some of the faculty, who allowed them to eat a late dinner and skip final drill for additional practicing. This was against the direct orders of the school superintendent, who had banned football and similar activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{railway network}} joined Burton in August 1839, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> more {{economical}} to distribute beer throughout the country. In 1842 William Worthington entered into partnership with Thomas Robinson, {{and the business}} traded as Worthington & Robinson. By 1861 Worthington employed 191 men and boys. Worthington dissolved the Robinson partnership in 1864, in order for his sons to acquire the business. The company became known as Worthington and Company, the co-partners being: William (1799-1871), {{with two of his}} sons, William Henry (1826-1894) and Calvert (1830-1871), who were joined two years later by his youngest son, Albert Octavius (1844-1918). After the introduction of agencies in British conurbations from the mid-1860s, the company began to rapidly expand. In 1866 the Prince of Wales awarded the company the Royal Warrant. Worthington pioneered brewing science from 1866 by employing a chemist, Horace Tabberer Brown, who led the world in separation and cultivation of pure yeast strains. From 1872 the Worthington brewery was the first in the world to systematically use a laboratory in the brewing process. The company had previously resisted employing a laboratory, for fear that the public would perceive the scientific apparatus as a means of doctoring the beer. In order to differentiate themselves from other brewers, Worthington labelled their beers with alphabetical letters: their Burton Ales were called G, F and D, their light dinner ale was labelled M. Worthington E was an India Pale Ale, a competitor to Bass Pale Ale. By 1880, Worthington's IPA was challenging Bass's sales in the home market.|$|E

25|$|In 1973 in the United States and Canada, and 1975 in {{the rest}} of the world, the 1500 engine was used to make the Spitfire 1500. Although in this final {{incarnation}} the engine was rather rougher and more prone to failure than the earlier units, torque was greatly increased by increasing the cylinder stroke to , which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> more drivable in traffic.|$|E
25|$|By 1810, Bowling Green had 154 residents. Growth in {{steamboat}} {{commerce and}} {{the proximity of}} the Barren River increased Bowling Green's importance. Canal locks and dams on the Barren River <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> more navigable. In 1832, the first portage railway connected the river to the location of the current county courthouse. Mules pulled freight and passengers to and from the city on the tracks.|$|E

60|$|The balloon was by {{this time}} tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground, for the air within it was hot, and this <b>made</b> <b>it</b> so <b>much</b> lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky.|$|R
50|$|Kilwa's fortuitous {{position}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> a <b>much</b> better East African {{trade center}} than Mogadishu.

25|$|The {{official}} {{explanation for}} this campaign was that the state was vulnerable due to foreign religious efforts (e.g. the Vatican, US evangelical churches) and that therefore the churches in Russia needed to be deprived of all public rights {{with the exception of}} liturgical services conducted within church walls. All of these regulations together <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> easier for the state to arbitrarily persecute clergy and their families, especially with regard to the discriminatory financial, land use and housing regulations.|$|E
25|$|Eight whiskey distilleries {{opened on}} 7th Street Road {{after the end}} of prohibition, and Louisville {{attempted}} to annex them to increase its tax base. Not wanting to pay city taxes, the whiskey companies persuaded the Kentucky General Assembly to pass the Shively Bill, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> more difficult for Louisville to annex additional areas. The distilleries used Kentucky's existing laws (which favored the mostly rural communities in the state) to form a ½ square-mile city named Shively in 1938. Shively grew to include residential areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{scarcity}} of Indian {{women in the}} Caribbean {{may not have been}} completely due to the women's inability to perform work required of them. Many Coolie women saw the chance to leave for the Caribbean as a way to escape abusive husbands, to hide pregnancy, to escape shame, or to simply find a better life. The 1883 Indian Immigration Act aimed to stop women from escaping their abusive husbands, which in turn <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> more difficult for women to emigrate. This in part due to an agent generally needing to travel to the woman's village in order to verify who she was.|$|E
50|$|From {{the middle}} of the 14th century, Waldsassen alternated between periods of {{prosperity}} and decline. Wars, famines, excessive taxation, and persecution by the Hussites <b>made</b> <b>it</b> suffer <b>much.</b> During the Bavarian War (1504) the monastery, church and farm-buildings were burned, but immediately afterwards rebuilt, and the new church was consecrated in 1517.|$|R

25|$|There {{were few}} {{houses in the}} area and the railway felt that it was {{unnecessary}} to build more than one station to serve the line through Aker. The station received a significant catchment area including the neighborhood of Bestum. The arrival of the railway <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> easier to commute to the city center, and from the 1870s there was a significant increase in construction of houses along the route. The station was originally named Tyskestranden. This was derived from the contemporary name of the innermost part of the bay of Bestumkilen, along the Bestum side between Vækerø and Sjølyst. The station took the name Bygdø in December 1876. The name change came {{at the behest of the}} Bygdøy Royal Estate, which occupied the northern portion of the peninsula south of the station.|$|E
25|$|The T-34-85 {{gave the}} Red Army a tank with better armour and {{mobility}} than the German Panzer IV tank and StuG III assault gun. While {{it could not}} match the armour or weapons of the heavier Panther and Tiger tanks, its improved firepower <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> more effective than earlier models. In comparison with the T-34-85 program, the Germans instead chose an upgrade path based on the introduction of completely new, expensive, heavier, and more complex tanks, greatly slowing the growth of their tank production and aiding the Soviets in maintaining a substantial numerical superiority in tanks. By May 1944, T-34-85 production had reached 1,200 tanks per month. In the entire war, production figures for all Panther types reached no more than 6,557, and for all Tiger types 2,027. Production figures for the T-34-85 alone reached 22,559.|$|E
25|$|The first European to see {{the island}} group was the Portuguese {{explorer}} Ferdinand Magellan who on March 6, 1521, observed a string of islands and sailed between two of them during a Spanish expedition of world circumnavigation. Historically, the southern village of Umatac, Guam has been credited {{as the site of}} Magellan's landing, however, scholarly study of the navigator's diary, now kept in preservation in the Philippines, revealed a drawing of the islands with a tiny island to the south of a much larger island above it. The described placement of the islands <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> more likely that Magellan had actually sailed between Guam and Cocos Island, and not Guam and Rota, as originally thought. This discovery meant that Magellan could not have landed in Umatac, but more likely in a northern location like Tanguisson or Tumon Bay.|$|E

25|$|The South Baffin dialect (Qikiqtaaluk nigiani) {{is spoken}} across the {{southern}} part of Baffin Island, including the territorial capital Iqaluit. This has in recent years <b>made</b> <b>it</b> a <b>much</b> more widely heard dialect, since a great deal of Inuktitut media originates in Iqaluit. Some linguists also distinguish an East Baffin dialect from either South Baffin or North Baffin, which is an Inuvialuk dialect.|$|R
25|$|In early September, {{optimism}} increased among German commanders {{that the}} Flanders offensive had been defeated and several divisions and air units were transferred elsewhere. Drier weather and extensive road repairs <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> {{easier for the}} British to move vast amounts of supplies forward from the original front line. Visibility increased except for frequent ground fog around dawn, which helped conceal British infantry during the attack, before clearing to expose German troop movements to British observation and attack. The British infantry succeeded in capturing most of their objectives and then holding them against German counter-attacks, inflicting many casualties on the local German defenders and Eingreifdivisionen sent to reinforce them by massed artillery and small-arms fire. German defences on the Gheluvelt Plateau, which had been retained or quickly recaptured in July and August were lost and the British began a run of success which lasted into early October.|$|E
25|$|In 540, Khosrow {{broke his}} {{peace with the}} Byzantines and struck Mesopotamia and Syria; he sacked Sura and killed its commander, Arsaces. He then moved out to Antioch, taking a path that was south of the usual {{military}} route in order to extract tribute from towns {{along the way to}} Antioch. The walls of Antioch had been greatly damaged during an earthquake in 525–526, and the Romans had not since repaired them because of western military campaigns, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> easier to conquer. Khosrow sacked and burned the city, at which point Justinian sued for peace, giving Khosrow a large amount of money; a down payment of 5000 pounds of gold plus 500 pounds of gold extra each year. While traveling back to Persia, Khosrow took ransoms from multiple Byzantine towns, at which point Justinian called off his truce and prepared to send his great commander Belisarius to move against the Sasanians.|$|E
25|$|Since 1979, it {{has been}} {{prohibited}} for federal funds to cover abortion costs for Peace Corps volunteers. Even in instances of life endangerment, rape and incest, volunteers are not financially covered. 433 Peace Corps volunteers were interviewed and {{it was reported that}} many thought the funding ban on abortion coverage should be removed. This was a two-month interview with no eligibility restrictions. Abortion is such a controversial topic that this just <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>much</b> more difficult for the Peace Corps to handle. Volunteers do receive health care, including prescription medications, routine examinations, and emergency care, free of charge. These services are provided in-country through a Peace Corps Medical Officer. Peace Corps volunteers don't make much money, which adds to this issue in the news. The abortion topic is very active in the Peace Corps, because when volunteers become pregnant for any reason, they can no longer be volunteers, and a significant number of them want to remain volunteers. Many volunteers have the same or very similar story.|$|E
