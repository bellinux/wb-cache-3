40|$|The plate <b>multipass</b> <b>rolling</b> {{process with}} plane pattern control was {{analyzed}} with updated geometry method {{on the platform}} software LS-DYNA. After one pass was finished, simulation model of the next pass was built and the rolling geometry model was updated by changing roll gap, material attribute, boundary conditions and loads. By comparing the simulated results with measured data, {{it is found that}} good agreement is achieved, the updated geometry method can be used to analyze the plate plane pattern in plate rolling process and a new method of using simple pass rolling model can be used to solve <b>multipass</b> <b>rolling</b> problems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} different commercial finite element codes in modelling a industrial 4 -stand tandem mill. This topic is of primary importance for VIR[FAB] (EC project) since different partners use different commercial finite element codes and the modelling should not {{be sensitive to the}} choice of finite element software. During this study the <b>multipass</b> <b>rolling</b> of aluminium alloy AA 5182 was analysed using the commercial codes LARSTRAN/-SHAPE and MSC/MARC. Both simulations were thermo-mechanically coupled and similar mesh densities were used. Results have shown that the set of results obtained is consistent across the commercial codes used...|$|E
40|$|The {{updating}} geometric {{method was}} proposed {{to simulate the}} deformation behavior of workpiece during multipass shape rolling by using finite element method. Firstly, establish and solve the finite element model of the first pass shape rolling process, then update the geometric shape of workpiece after the first pass and delete rolls of the first pass, establish and mesh rolls of the second pass, modify the boundaries and material parameters of workpiece, and solve its deformation behavior during the second pass shape rolling. With the same steps, its deformation behavior during the following passes rolling could be solved. The method was applied to simulate the deformation behavior of a cube workpiece during six-pass H-beam rolling with split-rolling, and its shapes after every pass rolling process were obtained. Experiments on the deformation behavior of slab during <b>multipass</b> <b>rolling</b> were carried out by using pure lead in an experimental mill. The calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental ones...|$|E
40|$|The microstructures of hot- and {{cold-rolled}} Mg- 3 Al- 1 Zn (AZ 31) {{are examined}} using scanning electron and optical microscopy. It is {{shown that the}} microstructures following <b>multipass</b> hot <b>rolling</b> and annealing are more uniform than those formed by heavy single pass rolling and annealing. The importance of twins in producing intragranular recrystallization is evident, although the most dominant nucleation site is grain boundaries. The cold-rolled structure after a rolling reduction of 15 pct {{is dominated by the}} presence of deformation twins. Twin trace analysis suggests that approximately two thirds of the twins are a form of “c-axis compression” twin. A number of “c-axis tension” twins were also observed and additional in-situ scanning electron microscopy experiments were performed to confirm earlier observations that suggest these twins can form after deformation, during unloading. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The <b>multipass</b> V-H <b>rolling</b> {{process with}} {{different}} vertical roll shape was simulated by explicit dynamic FEM and updating geometric method {{and the head}} and tail shape of rolled piece for different pass and vertical roll shape was analyzed. The results show that when using flat vertical roll, the wedge angle appears in tail, {{but it does not}} appear when using shape vertical roll, and the length of rolled piece is shorter than that using shape vertical roll, so its elongation is larger; when using shape vertical roll, the head and tail shape of rolled piece changs little as the groove fillet radius of roll changes. At the same time, the calculated head and tail shape of rolled piece for flat vertical roll in different pass is consistent with the measured one when the model material is lead...|$|R
40|$|Three passes of {{plate rolling}} during vertical-horizontal rolling process are {{simulated}} with explicit dynamic {{finite element method}} and updating geometric method. The equivalent strain and stress fields, and shape change at the head and tail of slab during rolling are obtained. The calculated result of the shape at the head and tail of slab is in good agreement with the measured one. The explicit dynamic finite element method and updating geometric method can be used effectively to analyze the <b>multipass</b> vertical-horizontal (V-H) <b>rolling</b> process. © 2006 Central Iron and Steel Research Institute...|$|R
40|$|The {{blanking}} {{conversion of}} {{titanium alloy ingots}} is studied. The purpose {{is to develop a}} process for manufacturing the high-quality titanium alloy billets by the radial shear rolling of large-sized round ingots. A dependence of the tangential rolling-out factor on the process cyclic recurrence is detected for the <b>multipass</b> <b>rolling</b> of large sized titanium ingots. A distribution of the factor in passes and a deformation centre distance is determined. Semiempiric formula for calculating the maximum width and the contact surface area are obtained. A technique of the calculation of the energy and force parameters is redetermined. The efficiency of the application of the radial shear rolling to the intensive structure working of the large-sezed titanium ingots is shown. The judicious rolling conditions affording the manufacture of high-quality billets are determined. The commercial technology of the blanking conversion of verious titanium alloy ingots with a diameter of 420 - 770 mm is developed. The technology developed has been adorpted at the RSP- 500 stand at Chepetsk Machinery Plant and formed the basis for the request for proposal of the RSP- 800 stand.

40|$|A 0. 4 C- 2 Si- 1 Cr- 1 Mo steel with an {{ultrafine}} elongated grain (UFEG) {{structure and}} an ultrafine equiaxed grain (UFG) structure was fabricated by <b>multipass</b> caliber <b>rolling</b> at 773 K and subsequent annealing at 973 K. A static {{three-point bending test}} was conducted at ambient temperature and at 77 K. The strength–toughness balance of the developed steels was markedly better than that of conventionally {{quenched and tempered steel}} with a martensitic structure. In particular, the static fracture toughness of the UFEG steel, having a yield strength of 1. 86 GPa at ambient temperature, was improved by more than 40 times compared with conventional steel having a yield strength of 1. 51 GPa. Furthermore, even at 77 K, the fracture toughness of the UFEG steel was about eight times higher than that of the conventional and UFG steels, despite the high strength of the UFEG steel (2. 26 GPa). The UFG steel exhibited brittle fracture behavior at 77 K, as did the conventional steel, and no dimple structure was observed on the fracture surface. Therefore, it is difficult to improve the low-temperature toughness of the UFG steel by grain refinement only. The shape of crystal grains {{plays an important role in}} delamination toughening, as do their refinement and orientation...|$|R
40|$|Evolution of texture during {{cross rolling}} and {{subsequent}} annealing was studied in high-purity nickel. For this purpose nickel samples {{were subjected to}} <b>multipass</b> cross <b>rolling</b> up to 90 pct reduction in thickness followed by annealing at different temperatures ranging between 673 K and 1073 K (400 C and 800 C). Cross rolling {{was carried out by}} rotating the samples about the normal direction (ND) by 90 deg interchanging the rolling direction and transverse direction (TD) between each consecutive pass. The development of microstructure and texture was characterized using X-ray and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) techniques. The deformation texture was characterized by the presence of strong brass ({ 110 }〈; 112 〉) and ND-rotated brass ({ 011 } 〈; 2113 ̄ 13 〉)) orientations. Upon annealing at 673 K (400 C), ND||[111] fiber could be observed in the microtexture which originated from the twin formation of the recrystallized TD-rotated cube ({ 027 } 〈; 07 ̄ 2 〉) grains. The fiber was weakened after annealing at 1073 K (800 C) because of the decreased propensity for twin formation, and the microtexture was found to be weak and diffused. EBSD studies on early recrystallization stages indicated the absence of preferential nucleation of cube grains being in agreement with a weak cube texture formation in annealed cross-rolled high-purity nicke...|$|R
40|$|<b>Multipass</b> hot <b>rolling</b> of AA 6082 {{aluminium}} alloy were investigated {{by means of}} the simulative technique based on multistage hot torsion tests, performed on a hydraulically powered servo-controlled torsion machine. Three different test procedures, characterized by a linear decreasing temperature (from 525 to 300 °C), a constant time between two subsequent deformations (20, 60 or 300 s) and a cumulative strain of 6. 4 (number of passes equal to 16 or 32), were used: a) with constant strain rate on the specimen surface and constant strain per pass, b) with a linear increasing strain rate with a strain rate jump after each pass and constant strain per pass, c) with linear increasing strain rate and decreasing strain per pass. This allowed to simulate the rolling schedules for many combinations of process parameters. The influence of static and dynamic control parameters on the flow behaviour of the alloy was investigated in detail by analysing the flow curves. In particular, the envelope curves are influenced by the interpass time even if, at high temperatures, no significant effect is observed. The effect of the strain per pass differs from the one expected due to the strengthening effect produced by the static precipitation of second phase particles that is more enhanced as pass strain decreases. The strain rate path affects the envelope curves due to the strong influence of temperature on the constitutive parameters; finally, a more pronounced effect is produced by the strain path since early stages performed with larger pass strain values, owing to the more effectiveness of the dynamic restoration processes, lower the envelope curves...|$|R
