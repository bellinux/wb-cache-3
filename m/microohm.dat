Samples of the low-temperature tetragonal and the high-temperature orthorhombic phases were separately obtained. The room-temperature intrinsic resistivities were 24 and 57 <b>microohm</b> cm for the low- and high-temperature structures, respectively.

Contact resistances lower than 50 <b>microohm</b> were obtained, allowing passage, without heating, of a direct current of about 5 A while the sample remained in the superconducting state at 20 K.

40|$|Vapor-grown {{graphite}} fibers were {{heat treated}} at 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800, and 3000 C, brominated {{at room temperature}} for two days, and then characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and resistivity measurements. Fibers greater than 13 microns in diameter had low resistivities (50 <b>microohms</b> or less) irrespective of the heat treatment temperature. An analysis of the results obtained suggests that resistivities below 6 <b>microohms</b> cannot be achieved through a further reduction in defect level unless the amount of bromine is increased...|$|R
40|$|We have {{deposited}} YBa 2 Cu 3 O(7 -delta) (YBCO) {{films with}} low microwave surface resistance (Rs) on 5 -cm-diam, oxide-buffered sapphire substrates by planar magnetron sputtering. MgO buffer layers are used on M-plane (1 0 - 1 0) sapphire, and R-plane (1 - 1 0 2) sapphire is buffered by CeO 2. Rs values of 450 - 620 microhms at 77 K and 10 GHz were measured across an entire 5 -cm diam YBCO film on M-plane sapphire. For YBCO on R-plane sapphire, Rs values at 77 K and 10 GHz were 950 <b>microohms</b> for a 5 -cm-diam wafer and 700 <b>microohms</b> for 1 x 1 sq cm samples...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{measurements}} of Mo-Si-based thin-film resistance thermometers were studied. Annealing in an argon ambient at a temperature above 1000 C {{for at least}} 1 h is required to form the stable tetragonal MoSi 2 phase. With a crack-free 2 -micron-thick AlN barrier layer on top, a sensor was tested up to 1200 C. The resistivity vs temperature characteristic shows the room temperature resistivity and temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) of the sensor to be approximately 350 <b>microohm</b> and 0. 01195 K, respectively.

These intercalated fibers have tensile strengths of 160000 psi, and Young's moduli of 25 x 10 to the 6 th psi. For aerospace use, 1 /(resistivity x density) is a figure of merit.

40|$|We {{have grown}} and studied high quality SrRuO 3 films grown by MBE {{as well as}} PLD. By {{changing}} the oxygen activity during deposition {{we were able to}} make SrRuO 3 samples that were stoichiometric (low oxygen activity) or with ruthenium vacancies (high oxygen activity). Samples with strontium vacancies were found impossible to produce since the ruthenium would precipitate out as RuO 2. The volume of the unit cell of SrRuO 3 becomes larger as more ruthenium vacancies are introduced. The residual resistivity ratio (RRR) and room temperature resistivity were found to systematically depend on the volume of the unit cell and therefore on the amount of ruthenium vacancies. The RRR varied from ~ 30 for stoichiometric samples to less than two for samples that were very ruthenium poor. The room temperature resistivity varied from 190 <b>microOhm</b> cm for stoichoimetric samples to over 300 <b>microOhm</b> cm for very ruthenium poor samples. UPS spectra show a shift of weight from the coherent peak to the incoherent peak around the Fermi level when samples have more ruthenium vacancies. Core level XPS spectra of the ruthenium 3 d lines show a strong screened part in the case of stoichiometric samples. This screened part disappears when ruthenium vacancies are introduced. Both the UPS and the XPS results are consistent with the view that correlation increases as the amount of ruthenium vacancies increase.

40|$|Platinum and {{platinum}} oxide {{films were}} deposited using thermal and remote plasma ALD. The combination of MeCpPtMe 3 precursor and O 2 gas or a short (0. 5 s) O 2 plasma exposure resulted in high purity, low-resistivity (15 <b>microOhm</b> cm), high-density (21 g/cm 3), cubic platinum films. The combination of MeCpPtMe 3 precursor with a longer (5 s) O 2 plasma exposure resulted in semi-conductive PtO 2 films {{with a band}} gap of ~ 1. 5 eV. The long nucleation delay observed with the thermal process could be overcome by using the remote plasma process where atomic oxygen is provided from the gas phase. The ALD process dependence on substrate temperature was investigated, where both the thermal and the remote plasma Pt process revealed a temperature window from 200 C to 300 C and the remote plasma PtO 2 process had a temperature window from 100 C to 300 C...|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} the temperature {{dependence of the}} microwave surface impedance Zs = Rs + iΩμ_ 0 of two c-axis oriented MgB 2 films at a frequency Ω /(2 π) of 17. 9 GHz employing a dielectric (sapphire) resonator technique. The temperature dependence of the magnetic field penetration depth can be well fitted from 5 K close to Tc by the standard BCS integral expression assuming the reduced energy gap Delta(0) /kTc to be as low as 1. 13 and 1. 03 for the two samples. For the penetration depth at zero temperatures, values of 110 nm and 115 nm were determined from the fit. Our results clearly indicates the s-wave character of the order parameter. The temperature dependence of the surface resistance Rs below Tc/ 2 {{is consistent with the}} low value of the energy gap. The surface resistance below 8 K was found to be below the resolution limit of 100 <b>microOhm</b> of our measurement technique. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figures,submitted to PR...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{structure}} of the superconducting gap in MgB 2 thin films by means of point-contact spectroscopy using a gold tip. The films were produced by depositing pure boron on a sapphire substrate, using e-beam evaporation, followed by reaction with magnesium vapour. The films have a Tc of 38. 6 +- 0. 3 K and resistivity of about 20 <b>microOhm</b> cm at 40 K. The point-contact spectra prove directly the existence of a multi-valued order parameter in MgB 2, with two distinct values of the gap, DELTA 1 = 2. 3 +- 0. 3 meV and DELTA 2 = 6. 2 +- 0. 7 meV at 4. 2 K. Analysis of the spectra in terms of the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model reveals that both gaps close simultaneously at the Tc of the film. Possible mechanisms that can explain the intrinsic co-existence of two values of the gap are discussed. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} 1 -MeV {{electron}} irradiation, up {{to a total}} dose of 5. 7 x 10 to the 17 th electrons/sq cm at room temperature on YBa 2 Cu 3 O(x) was investigated using gold bead contacts made by the melting technique. The superconducting transition temperature Tc, the critical current density Jc at 77 K, the normal-state resistivity, and the contact resistance for gold bead contacts were measured {{as a function of}} fluence on the same samples without disturbing the contacts. Tc remained constant at 91 K, and Jc at 77 K remained constant around 90 A/sq cm. The normal-state resistivity increased systematically by about 15 percent for the total dose. Finally, the surface contact resistance at 77 K remained less than 4. 2 <b>microohm</b> sq cm throughout the radiations. These studies took place over an 8 -month period, and subsequent measurements indicate that the results are definitely due to radiation effects and not aging effects. It is concluded that the superconductor YBa 2 Cu 3 O(x) with gold bead contacts would perform well in a space environment of electron irradiation...|$|E

Films of thicknesses 50 - 200 nm are deposited at temperatures ranging from 400 °C to 800 °C under reactor pressures of 1 and 5 mbar using various ammonia flow rates, and are characterized {{by the use of}} complementary techniques, namely X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), secondary neutral mass spectrometry (SNMS), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrical measurements. Films deposited above 450 8 C consist of the cubic d-NbN phase, apart from the presence of Nb-O and Nb-O-N species predominantly in the outermost film regions. The lowest specific resistivities, determined by four point probe measurements, are in the range 500 – 600 <b>microohm</b> cm. A NbN/SiO 2 /p-Si gate stack is fabricated using the grown niobium nitride films.

40|$|Devices {{based on}} a pure spin current (a flow of spin angular momentum) have been {{attracting}} increasing attention as key ingredients for low-dissipation electronics. To integrate such spintronics devices into charge-based technologies, an electric detection of spin current is essential. Inverse spin Hall effect converts a spin current into an electric voltage through spin-orbit coupling. Noble metals such as Pt and Pd, and also Cu-based alloys, owing to the large direct spin Hall effect, have been regarded as potential materials for a spin-current injector. Those materials, however, are not promising as a spin-current detector based on inverse spin Hall effect. Their spin Hall resistivity rho_SH, representing the performance as a detector, is not large enough mainly due to their low charge resistivity. Here we demonstrate that heavy transition metal oxides can overcome such limitations inherent to metal-based spintronics materials. A binary 5 d transition metal oxide IrO 2, owing to its large resistivity {{as well as a}} large spin-orbit coupling associated with 5 d character of conduction electrons, was found to show a gigantic rho_SH ~ 38 <b>microohm</b> cm at room temperature, one order of magnitude larger than those of noble metals and Cu-based alloys and even comparable to those of atomic layer thin film of W and Ta...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the doping effects of carbohydrate (malic acid, C 4 H 6 O 5), from 0 wt% to 30 wt% of total MgB 2, on the phase, lattice parameters, critical temperature, resistivity, and {{upper critical field}} of MgB 2 superconductor. The lattice parameters calculated show a large decrease in the a-axis for MgB 2 + C 4 H 6 O 5 samples, but {{no change in the}} c-axis. This is an indication of the carbon substitution into boron coming from C 4 H 6 O 5, resulting in enhancement of resistivity, critical current density, and upper critical field. Specifically, the critical current density value of 25000 Acm 2 at 5 K and 8 T for the MgB 2 + 30 wt% C 4 H 6 O 5 sample is higher than that of the un-doped MgB 2 by a factor of 21. In addition, resistivity value for all the MgB 2 + C 4 H 6 O 5 samples ranged from 80 to 90 <b>microohm</b> centimeter at 40 K, which is higher than for un-doped MgB 2. The increased resistivity indicates increased impurity scattering due to carbon, resulting in enhanced upper critical field. Comment: 4 page, 5 figures, ASC 2006 conferenc...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrical}} resistivity of thin potassium films at 100 °K has been measured {{as a function}} of thickness in the thickness range 148 to 1600 angstroms. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with Fuchs 2 ̆ 7 theoretical predictions in the range 500 to 1600 angstroms and show that the scattering of the electrons at the film surfaces is completely diffuse. Comparison of experimental and theoretical curves gives a bulk resistivity parameter of 1. 85 <b>microohm</b> cm, a mean free path of 1180 angstroms, and an electron to atom density ratio of 1. 01. The films were deposited on a pyrex substrate from a beam of potassium vapor in a vacuum chamber which had a pressure less than 5 x 10 - 8 mm of Hg. The film thickness, in each case, was computed from a known beam intensity, exposure time, and film density. A surface ionization detector was used to calibrate the beam intensity (J 1) {{as a function of}} effusion oven temperature (To). The linear plot of log (J 1 To 1 / 2) versus To- 1 gave a heat of sublimation for potassium at 450 °K of 21. 1 kcal/mole in good agreement with Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s value of 21. 4 kcal/mole within our experimental error...|$|E

A sample of polonium is approximatelyf 1 x 10 {sup 9 } disintegrations per minute was counted in a Logac for 250 days {{in order to determine the}} half life. A statistical treatment of the results gave a half life of 138. 3562 {+-} 0. 446 days. Combined with previous calorimetric determinations a new grand mean of 138. 3975 {+-} 0. 0091 days resulted. The wavelengths of 138 lines appearing in the spark spectrum between 3050 A and 3463 A (Region 4) have been tentatively assigned to polonium and have a probable error of less than 0. 02 A. Thirty six lines in Region 6 (4225 A to 5675 A) tentatively assigned to polonium have a probable error of less than D D 6 A. A measurement of the resistivity of polonium has given a value of about 95 <b>microohm</b> centimeters, and although the Hall voltage could not be measured with much precision, it was possible to set a maximum value of 0. 03 millivolt. These values indicate the polonium is a metallic conductor rather than a semiconductor. A rugged but compact gauge made of stainless steel with a tantalum diaphragm has been constructed to have a good sensitivity for the vapor pressure measurement of polonium tetrachloride. Studies by X-ray methods have shown that platinum nickel, and silver form compounds with polonium under the conditions of preparation, while tantalum, gold stainless steel, and beryllium do not.
