5|$|Psoriasis has {{a strong}} {{hereditary}} component, and many genes are associated with it, but {{it is unclear how}} those genes work together. Most of the identified genes relate to the immune system, particularly the <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> (MHC) and T cells. Genetic studies are valuable due to their ability to identify molecular mechanisms and pathways for further study and potential drug targets.|$|E
5|$|Rodents use scent marking in {{many social}} {{contexts}} including inter- and intra-species communication, the marking of trails {{and the establishment}} of territories. Their urine provides genetic information about individuals including the species, the sex and individual identity, and metabolic information on dominance, reproductive status and health. Compounds derived from the <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> (MHC) are bound to several urinary proteins. The odor of a predator depresses scent-marking behavior.|$|E
5|$|The major {{determinant}} is PSORS1, {{which probably}} accounts for 35%–50% of psoriasis heritability. It controls genes {{that affect the}} immune system or encode skin proteins that are overabundant with psoriasis. PSORS1 is located on chromosome 6 in the <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> (MHC), which controls important immune functions. Three genes in the PSORS1 locus have a strong association with psoriasis vulgaris: HLA-C variant HLA-Cw6, which encodes a MHC class I protein; CCHCR1, variant WWC, which encodes a coiled protein that is overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis; and CDSN, variant allele 5, which encodes corneodesmosin, a protein which is expressed in the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis and upregulated in psoriasis.|$|E

50|$|An {{antigen-presenting cell}} (APC) or {{accessory}} cell is a cell that displays antigen <b>complexed</b> with <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complexes</b> (MHCs) on their surfaces; {{this process is}} known as antigen presentation. T cells may recognize these complexes using their T cell receptors (TCRs). These cells process antigens and present them to T-cells.|$|R
40|$|The loci of the porcine tumour {{necrosis}} factor genes, alpha (TNFA) and beta (TNFB), {{have been}} chromosomally assigned by radioactive in situ hybridization. The genomic probes for TNFA and TNFB yielded signals above 7 p 11 -q 11, {{a region that}} has been shown earlier to carry the porcine <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> locus (SLA). These mapping data along with preliminary molecular studies suggest a genomic organization of the SLA {{that is similar to}} that of human and murine <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complexes...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{mechanism}} for unfolding of globular proteins is necessarily general, but somewhat {{dependent on the}} amino acid sequence. Long sequences of alternating glycine and alanine {{have been shown to}} inhibit substrate unfolding, decreasing the efficiency of proteasomal degradation; this results in the release of partially degraded byproducts, possibly due to the decoupling of the ATP hydrolysis and unfolding steps. Such glycine-alanine repeats are also found in nature, for example in silk fibroin; in particular, certain Epstein–Barr virus gene products bearing this sequence can stall the proteasome, helping the virus propagate by preventing antigen presentation on the <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex.</b>|$|E
5|$|Specific {{genes that}} have been linked with MS include {{differences}} in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system—a group of genes on chromosome 6 {{that serves as the}} <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> (MHC). That changes in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known since the 1980s, and additionally this same region has been implicated in the development of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most consistent finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and alleles of the MHC defined as DR15 and DQ6. Other loci have shown a protective effect, such as HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11. Overall, {{it has been estimated that}} HLA changes account for between 20 and 60% of the genetic predisposition. Modern genetic methods (genome-wide association studies) have discovered at least twelve other genes outside the HLA locus that modestly increase the probability of MS.|$|E
25|$|The domains have binding regions for the <b>Major</b> <b>Histocompatibility</b> <b>Complex</b> Class II (MHC Class II) and the T cell {{receptor}} (TCR), respectively.|$|E
30|$|In vivo, antigens (or AuNVs) are uptaken by {{professional}} APCs (i.e., DCs), and the TAA-derived peptides are subsequently loaded onto <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complexes</b> (MHCs) for stimulation of CD 8 + CTLs and CD 4 + helper T cells[26]. Previous ELISPOT assays exposed AuNVs directly to splenocytes, {{which was a}} rudimentary way to evaluate the effects of AuNVs. Although there are some antigen-presenting cells in the splenocyte mixture, {{the result would be}} occasionally inconclusive.|$|R
40|$|The {{organization}} and biology of the <b>Major</b> <b>Histocompatibility</b> <b>Complexes</b> (MHC) of man (HLA) and dog (DLA) are reviewed, and a summary is presented of laboratory techniques {{used to define}} allotypes. The nomenclature of this field and the mechanisms of disease association with the MHC are discussed. Currently recognized HLA-disease associations are enumerated, with emphasis {{on the value of}} the complement C 4 marker. DLA-disease association studies into autoimmune disease, allergy and neoplasia are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Peptides fulfill many {{roles in}} immunology, yet none are more {{important}} than their role as immunogenic epitopes driving the adaptive immune response, our ultimate bulwark against infectious disease. Peptide epitopes are mediated primarily by their interaction with <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complexes</b> (T-cell epitopes) and antibodies (B-cell epitopes). As pathogen genomes continue to be revealed, both experimental and computational epitope mapping are becoming crucial tools in vaccine discovery 1, 2. Immunoinformatics offers many tools, techniques and approaches for in silico epitope characterization, which is capable of greatly accelerating epitope design...|$|R
25|$|The {{genes of}} the <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> (MHC) are highly polymorphic, and this {{diversity}} plays {{a very important}} role in resistance to pathogens. This is true for other species as well.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Hood {{was among}} the first to study, at the gene level, the MHC (<b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex)</b> gene family and the T-cell {{receptor}} gene families as well as being among first to demonstrate that alternative RNA splicing was a fundamental mechanism for generating alternative forms of antibodies. He showed that RNA splicing is the mechanism for generating the membrane bound and the secreted forms of antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Immunogens can be {{targeted}} to various cellular compartments to improve antibody or cytotoxic T-cell responses. Secreted or plasma membrane-bound antigens {{are more effective}} at inducing antibody responses than cytosolic antigens, while cytotoxic T-cell responses can be improved by targeting antigens for cytoplasmic degradation and subsequent entry into the <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> (MHC) class I pathway. This is usually accomplished {{by the addition of}} N-terminal ubiquitin signals.|$|E
50|$|In a study {{conducted}} by Michael H. Crawford, human leukocyte antigen loci were found to encode for <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complexes.</b> Allele frequencies were plotted for similarities using principal component analysis (PCA) for the HLA-A locus exhibited by the Mayan population. Results plot close similarities with the Inupiat people of Native Alaskan heritage, the Waiapi of central Brazil and the Tohono O'odham of northern Mexico. The HLA-B locus was examined in a PCA plot and indicates a proximity to the Zuni of southwest North America and the Aymara of southern South America.|$|R
5000|$|A {{possible}} theory {{being studied}} {{now is that}} these axillary odors {{are being used to}} provide information about the immune system. Milinski and colleagues found that the artificial odors that people chose are determined in part by their <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complexes</b> (MHC) combination. Information about an individual’s immune system {{could be used as a}} way of [...] "sexual selection" [...] so that the female could obtain good genes for her offspring. Wedekind and colleagues found that both men and women prefer the axillary odors of people whose MHC is different from their own.|$|R

25|$|CD4+ helper T cells: T cells {{displaying}} co-receptor CD4 {{are known}} as CD4+ T cells. These cells have T-cell receptors and CD4 molecules that, in combination, bind antigenic peptides presented on <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> (MHC) class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells. Helper T cells make cytokines and perform other functions that help coordinate the immune response. In HIV infection, these T cells are the main index to identify the individual's immune system integrity.|$|E
25|$|Human {{leucocyte}} antigen (HLA) polymorphisms {{common in}} West Africans but rare in other racial groups, {{are associated with}} protection from severe malaria. This group of genes encodes cell-surface antigen-presenting proteins and has many other functions. In West Africa, they account for as great a reduction in disease incidence as the sickle-cell hemoglobin variant. The {{studies suggest that the}} unusual polymorphism of <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> genes has evolved primarily through natural selection by infectious pathogens.|$|E
25|$|It {{was known}} before the genomic era that {{clustered}} genes {{tend to be}} functionally related. Abderrahim et al. (1994) had shown that all the genes of the <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> were clustered on the 6p21 chromosome. Roy et al. (2002) showed that in the nematode C. elegans genes that are solely expressed in muscle tissue during the larval stage tend to cluster in small groups of 2–5 genes. They identified 13 clusters.|$|E
50|$|Antitumor receptors genetically {{engineered}} into normal T cells {{can be used}} for therapy. T cells can be redirected by the integration of genes encoding either conventional alpha-beta TCRs or CARs. CARs (Chimeric Antibody Receptors) were pioneered in the late 1980s and can be constructed by linking the variable regions of the antibody heavy and light chains to intracellular signaling chains such as CD3-zeta, potentially including costimulatory domains encoding CD28 or CD137. CARs can provide recognition of cell surface components not restricted to <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complexes</b> (MHC). They can be introduced into T cells with high efficiency using viral vectors.|$|R
50|$|The islet {{resident}} macrophage {{was first}} identified in 1979 as an antigen-presenting cell (APC), which expresses <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complexes</b> (MHCs). Later in 1984 this APC was further classified {{by using a}} macrophage specific marker F4/80. In 1988 {{it was discovered that}} macrophages play an essential role in the progression of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (T1D), in an animal model for non-obese diabetes (NOD mice). The role of pancreatic macrophages were later shown {{to play an important role}} in type 2 diabetes as well, by contributing to islet inflammation. The origin and turnover in the normal state was characterized by Emil Unanue in 2015.|$|R
25|$|Fungal {{immunomodulatory}} proteins (FIPs) are bioactive ingredients within genera Ganoderma {{that have}} immune building properties. FIPs stimulate different cells and cellular components that enable immune response. Some of the molecules and cells that FIPs influence include T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, and regulation of human monocyte DCs. Improved function of these cells will promote cytokine expression such as IL2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma which will support lymphocyte proliferation, immune cell initiation, and tumor inhibiting factors. Immunostimulation from FIPs could cause increased expression of costimulatory molecules and <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complexes</b> (MHC) which help {{to create a}} pathway for immune response to take place.|$|R
25|$|In both TSS (caused by S. aureus) and TSLS (caused by S. pyogenes), disease {{progression}} {{stems from a}} superantigen toxin that allows the nonspecific binding of MHC II with T-cell receptors, resulting in polyclonal T-cell activation. In typical T-cell recognition, an antigen is taken up by an antigen-presenting cell, processed, expressed on the cell surface in complex with class II <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> (MHC) in a groove formed by the alpha and beta chains of class II MHC, and recognized by an antigen-specific T-cell receptor.|$|E
25|$|Diversity of antigen presentation, {{mediated}} by MHC classes I and II, is attained {{in at least}} three ways: (1) an organism's MHC repertoire is polygenic (via multiple, interacting genes); (2) MHC expression is codominant (from both sets of inherited alleles); (3) MHC gene variants are highly polymorphic (diversely varying from organism to organism within a species). <b>Major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> and sexual selection has been observed in male mice making mate choices of females with different MHCs and thus demonstrating sexual selection. Also, at least for MHC I presentation, there has been evidence of antigenic peptide splicing which can combine peptides from different proteins, vastly increasing antigen diversity.|$|E
25|$|The E5 are small, very {{hydrophobic}} {{proteins that}} destabilise {{the function of}} many membrane proteins in the infected cell. The E5 protein of some animal papillomavirus types (mainly bovine papillomavirus type 1) functions as an oncogene primarily by activating the cell growth-promoting signaling of platelet-derived growth factor receptors. The E5 proteins of human papillomaviruses associated to cancer, however, seem to activate the signal cascade initiated by epidermal growth factor upon ligand binding. HPV16 E5 and HPV2 E5 have {{also been shown to}} down-regulate the surface expression of <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> class I proteins, which may prevent the infected cell from being eliminated by killer T cells.|$|E

Potential HLA-A 2 binding peptides from the putative immediate-early 62 protein (IE 62) of VZV were tested for binding, and peptides with sufficient binding capacity were used to generate pentamers. Patients with VZV reactivation following stem cell transplantation were screened with these pentamers, leading to {{the identification of the}} first validated class I-restricted epitope of VZV. In 42 % of HLA-A 2 patients following VZV reactivation, these IE 62 -ALW-A 2 T cells could be detected ex vivo...|$|R
40|$|With its {{implications}} for vaccine discovery, the accurate prediction of T cell epitopes {{is one of the}} key aspirations of computational vaccinology. We have developed a robust multivariate statistical method, based on partial least squares, for the quantitative prediction of peptide binding to <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complexes</b> (MHC), the principal checkpoint on the antigen presentation pathway. As a service to the immunobiology community, we have made a Perl implementation of the method available via a World Wide Web server. We call this server MHCPred.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> (B) <b>complex</b> hap-lotypes BQ and B 17 were {{examined}} for {{their effect on}} Rous sarcoma outcome. Pedigree matings of BQB 17 chickens from the second backcross generation (BC 2) of Line UCD 001 (BQBQ) mated to Line UCD 003 (B 17 B 17) produced progeny with genotypes BQBQ, BQB 17, and B 17 B 17. Six-week-old chickens were injected with subgroup A Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). The tumors were scored for size at 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks postinoculation. A tumor profile index (TPI) was assigned to each bird based on the six tumor scores. Two experiments with two trials each were conducted.

25|$|The <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> (MHC) {{is a set}} of cell surface {{proteins}} {{essential for}} the acquired immune system to recognize foreign molecules in vertebrates, which in turn determines histocompatibility. The main function of MHC molecules is to bind to antigens derived from pathogens and display them on the cell surface for recognition by the appropriate T-cells. MHC molecules mediate interactions of leukocytes, also called white blood cells (WBCs), which are immune cells, with other leukocytes or with body cells. The MHC determines compatibility of donors for organ transplant, as well as one's susceptibility to an autoimmune disease via crossreacting immunization. The human MHC is also called the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) complex (often just the HLA). The mouse MHC is called the H-2 complex or H-2.|$|E

500|$|The <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> (MHC) {{is a large}} genomic region {{found in}} most {{vertebrates}} {{that is associated with}} the immune system. It is located on chromosome 6 in humans. A subset of MHC in humans is human leukocyte antigen (HLA), which controls the antigen-presenting system, as part of adaptive immunity against pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. When human cells are infected by a pathogen, some of them can present parts of the pathogen's proteins on their surfaces; this is called [...] "antigen presentation". The infected cells then become targets for types of cytotoxic T-cells, which kill the infected cells so they can be removed from the body.|$|E
40|$|A cDNA clone {{encoding}} {{the human}} B cell alloantigen DC alpha chain (pDCH 1) {{has been used}} to analyse the structure of the human and murine <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complexes</b> by the DNA filter hybridization technique. The pDCH 1 probe hybridizes to a single DNA sequence present on chromosome 17 in the mouse genome. A restriction enzyme polymorphism enables us to map this sequence to the I-A subregion. Extensive restriction enzyme polymorphism detected in HLA-DR homozygous typing cells is reminiscent of the DR/MT linkage disequilibrium groups, suggesting that the pDCH 1 probe could be useful for haplotype typing in the human population. The HLA-DR region appears more complex than the I region since a second DC-like hybridizing sequence is detected in the human genome in these experiments...|$|R
50|$|A host’s {{immune system}} {{responds}} to pathogen invasion {{by a set}} of pathogen-specific responses in which many “players” participate; these include antibodies, T-helper cells, cytotoxic T-cells, and many others. Antigen-presenting cells (APC) are capable of internalizing pathogens and displaying a fragment of the antigen - the epitope - with <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complexes</b> (MHCs) on the cell surface. T-cell response is initiated when T-cells recognize these displayed epitopes. Only specific peptide sequences from some pathogen-specific antigens are needed to stimulate T- and B- cell responses; that is, the whole pathogenic peptide sequence is not necessary to initiate an immune response. The ‘immunome’ of a pathogen is described by its set of epitopes, and can be defined by comparing genome sequences and applying immunoinformatic tools.|$|R
40|$|During immune surveillance, T cells {{survey the}} surface of antigen-presenting cells. In searching for peptide-loaded <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complexes</b> (pMHCs), they must solve a classic {{trade-off}} between speed and sensitivity. It has long been supposed that microvilli on T cells act as sensory organs to enable search, but their strategy has been unknown. We used lattice light-sheet and quantum dot-enabled synaptic contact mapping microscopy to show that anomalous diffusion and fractal organization of microvilli survey the majority of opposing surfaces within 1 minute. Individual dwell times were long enough to discriminate pMHC half-lives and T cell receptor (TCR) accumulation selectively stabilized microvilli. Stabilization was independent of tyrosine kinase signaling and the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting selection for avid TCR microclusters. This work defines the efficient cellular search process against which ligand detection takes place...|$|R
