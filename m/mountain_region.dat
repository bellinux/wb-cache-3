5|$|Most Korean mammal {{species are}} {{found only in}} {{a small part of}} Korea. The large southeastern island of Jeju, and the rugged northeastern Paektu <b>Mountain</b> <b>region,</b> are {{particularly}} known for their distinctive mammal species. Several species, including the Dsinezumi shrew, are found only on Jeju, while many other species, such as the wild boar, are absent or extirpated from there. Some mammals, such as the Manchurian wapiti, are considered natural monuments of North Korea, while others, such as the spotted seal, are considered natural monuments of South Korea.|$|E

5|$|Larrys Creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale <b>mountain</b> <b>region,</b> {{with the}} {{source in the}} {{dissected}} Allegheny Plateau and the mouth in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. The {{southern part of the}} Larrys Creek watershed has sedimentary surface rocks from the Devonian period, with a large area from the Mississippian period in the north of the watershed and a small Pennsylvanian period region within this area. The Cogan House anticline runs north of and parallel to {{the upper part of the}} creek. Iron ore within the watershed was mined south of Salladasburg and along Canoe Run in the 19th century; there are also deposits on Puterbaugh Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, logging {{began in}} the Pinkham area. After almost total {{deforestation}} of the White <b>Mountain</b> <b>region,</b> the White Mountain National Forest was created in 1911, and the Mount Washington area {{was added to the}} national forest in 1914. With the preservation of the area, emphasis shifted from logging to recreation. The Appalachian Mountain Club converted a logging camp near the height-of-land into what is now the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center in 1921. The Appalachian Trail was built through the visitor center, making it an important trailhead for ascents of Mount Washington. Meanwhile, ski trails began to be constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps on Wildcat Mountain, and the ski resort was opened in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The conquest {{strengthened}} Tang {{rule over}} modern Xinjiang, {{administered by the}} Anxi Protectorate, and led to Tang suzerainty over the regions previously {{under the control of}} the Western Turks. The fall of the Khaganate brought the Altai <b>Mountain</b> <b>region</b> under Tang control and the residing Three Qarluq tribes were governed in newly established prefectures led by tribal chiefs, now commander-in-chiefs under the Tang. Another prefecture, the Jinman Bridle Prefecture, was created for the Chuyue tribes living in the southern Dzungar basin. The Amu Darya valley, the Tarim Basin, and the area beyond the Pamir Mountains, all former suzerains of the Western Turks, were placed under Tang control.|$|E

5|$|The {{excavation}} of Mummy Cave yielded a nearly continuous succession of artifacts, which span {{a period of}} over 9000years. The artifacts were disposed {{in a manner that}} permitted dating in both relative terms through stratigraphy, as well as through radiocarbon dating to establish an absolute scale. This continuum has proved to be invaluable in relating and dating other excavations in the Rocky <b>Mountain</b> <b>region.</b> In particular, the stone projectile points found at Mummy Cave have been used to set the standard for classifying stone arrowheads and spear heads in the region. The point typology has been extrapolated to define cultural and commercial relationships between peoples throughout the American West. Stratigraphy and carbon dating indicate that Mummy Cave was first occupied {{near the end of the}} Pinedale glaciation. Later occupancy spanned the Altithermal, followed by a cooler climate from about 1000BC.|$|E
5|$|White Deer Hole Creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale <b>mountain</b> <b>region,</b> {{entirely in}} the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. South and North White Deer Ridge and Bald Eagle Mountain are {{composed}} of sedimentary Ordovician rock, while the valley rock is Silurian, with a small Devonian region closer to the river, in the north. The watershed has no deposits of coal, nor natural gas or oil fields. The creek is in a narrow mountain valley with steep slopes in its upper reaches. In its middle and lower reaches it has steep mountain slopes to the south, and a wide valley with rolling hills and gentle slopes to the north. The channel pattern is transitional, with a trellised drainage pattern.|$|E

25|$|According to {{scholars}} such as Baij Nath Puri, the Mount Abu (ancient Arbuda <b>Mountain)</b> <b>region</b> of present-day Rajasthan had been abode of the Gurjars during medieval period.

These Gurjars migrated from the Arbuda <b>mountain</b> <b>region</b> and as early as in the 6th century A.D., they set up one or more principalities in Rajasthan and Gujarat.

40|$|The crucial {{importance}} of <b>mountain</b> <b>regions</b> for the cohesion policies is underlined by key Romanian and European Union documents.

This study has created Geographical Information Systems-based methodology to select Romanian hardly accessible <b>mountain</b> <b>regions</b> with a complex and high-valued touristic potential and determine their characteristics using spatial analysis based on specific indicators. The results indicate that <b>mountain</b> <b>regions</b> are affected by poor accessibility, resulting into the lack of basic supplies, as well as education and health issues. Tourism trends suggest reduced accommodation, food, and entertainment opportunities, increased number of tourists, but decreasing average durations of stay and usage of touristic facilities.
