5|$|The 1979 Vela Incident in the {{southern}} Atlantic Ocean <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> atmospheric nuclear test in contravention of the PTBT by Israel and South Africa, {{both of which were}} parties to the treaty.|$|E
5|$|The {{body was}} 1.63m in height. The mummy {{had a small}} face with no {{defining}} features, though he had slightly prominent front teeth; this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> inherited family trait, as this feature {{can be seen in}} some female mummies of the same family, as well as the mummy of his descendant, Thutmose II.|$|E
5|$|The golden ratio {{seems to}} be {{reflected}} in many Egyptian constructions, including the pyramids, but its use <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> unintended consequence of the ancient Egyptian practice of combining the use of knotted ropes with an intuitive sense of proportion and harmony.|$|E
50|$|According to Dixon (2002), Wunumara <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> dialect of Ngawun or of Mayi-Kulan, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> single language. Bowern (2011 2012), however, lists {{all six of}} {{the above}} as {{separate}} languages.|$|R
50|$|Beneath {{the castle}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> cavern, called the Browney's Cave which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> sally-port; a secret tunnel {{leading to the}} castle.|$|R

5|$|A 1997 {{survey of}} early astronomical records and {{drawings}} {{suggested that a}} certain dark surface feature discovered by astronomer Giovanni Cassini in 1690 <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> impact scar. The survey initially produced eight more candidate sites as potential impact observations that he and others had recorded between 1664 and 1839. It was later determined, however, that these candidate sites {{had little or no}} possibility of being the results of the proposed impacts.|$|E
5|$|A moat, {{approximately}} 190 metres (620 feet) to {{the south}} of the castle, was constructed in mediaeval times, likely {{around the time of the}} rebuilding in 1305. A Scheduled Ancient Monument in its own right, the moat encloses approximately an acre of land around the property. The moat <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> enclosure surrounding farm buildings connected to the castle.|$|E
5|$|An {{unidentified}} dark parrot seen {{alive by}} the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist in Africa {{was given the}} name Psittacus obscurus by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene parrot in 1766. Because of this association, some authors believed {{it was from the}} Mascarene Islands as well, but this dark parrot's description differs from that of the Mascarene parrot. This disagreement led some authors to use now-invalid combinations of the scientific names, such as Mascarinus obscurus and Coracopsis obscura. The unidentified parrot <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) instead.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, a Pompeian {{graffiti}} quotes what <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> folk saying: seni supino colei culum tegunt: [...] "when {{an old man}} lies down, his testicles cover his arsehole." [...] This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> proverb, and constitutes ribald humour; it does not demonstrate that the word was considered particularly obscene.|$|R
5|$|As a {{token of}} respect for Roman religion, however, Elagabalus joined either Astarte, Minerva, Urania, or some {{combination}} of the three to Elagabal as consort. A union between Elagabal and a traditional goddess would have served to strengthen ties between the new religion and the imperial cult. In fact, there <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> effort to introduce Elagabal, Urania, and Athena as the new Capitoline triad of Rome—replacing Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.|$|E
5|$|During 2008, Tomlinson was {{a witness}} for the inquest into {{the deaths of the}} Princess of Wales and Dodi al Fayed. He had {{suggested}} that MI6 was monitoring Diana before her death and that her driver on the night she died, Henri Paul, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> MI6 informant, and that her death resembled plans he saw during 1992 for the assassination of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević, using a bright light to cause a traffic accident.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald died in 640, and {{according}} to most versions of the Kentish Royal Legend was succeeded solely by his son Eorcenberht. However, an early text (Caligula A.xiv) refers to Eormenred as 'king', suggesting either he was a junior king under Eorcenberht, or had a shared kingship. One suggestion is that the some other version {{of events in the}} 'legend', which give him no title, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> attempt to discredit royal claimants from Eormenred's line.|$|E
25|$|A {{daughter}} of Cleopatra and Juba, whose name <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> recorded, <b>is</b> mentioned in <b>an</b> inscription. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> suggested that Drusilla of Mauretania was that daughter, but she <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> granddaughter instead. Drusilla <b>is</b> described as <b>a</b> grand{{daughter of}} Antony and Cleopatra, or <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> daughter of Ptolemy of Mauretania.|$|R
25|$|Davis' health <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{concern in}} the spring of 1934.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, Ichthyoconodon <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> glider, {{based on}} its {{relationship}} with the gliding Volaticotherium and the possibly also volant Argentoconodon. The presence of Argentoconodon in South America, Volaticotherium in Asia and Ichthyoconodon in North Africa in such a relatively close span of time suggests there <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> widespread clade of Jurassic-Early Cretaceous gliding triconodonts.|$|R
5|$|Fossils of Argentinean ferugliotheriids {{come from}} the Los Alamitos (Ferugliotherium), La Colonia (Ferugliotherium and Argentodites), and Allen Formations (Trapalcotherium). All three are {{approximately}} the same age, dating to the Campanian (84–71mya) or more likely the Maastrichtian (71–66mya), but the La Colonia Formation is perhaps a little younger. The Los Alamitos and Allen Formations may have been deposited in a marshy environments, and the depositional environment of the La Colonia Formations <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain.|$|E
5|$|Sheppard's tale <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> {{inspiration}} for William Hogarth's 1747 series of 12 engravings, Industry and Idleness, {{which shows the}} parallel descent of an apprentice, Tom Idle, into crime and eventually to the gallows, beside the rise of his fellow apprentice, Francis Goodchild, who marries his master's daughter and takes over his business, becoming wealthy as a result, eventually emulating Dick Whittington to become Lord Mayor of London.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{found the}} town of San Jorge de Olancho, {{probably}} in 1540, {{on the bank of}} the Olancho river close to Pech territory. Throughout the 1540s, the inhabitants of the mining district of Olancho launched revolts against their harsh treatment by their Spanish overlords, with notable uprisings occurring in 1542, 1544, and 1546. The greatest of these was the rebellion of 1544, which coincided with rebellions in Comayagua, San Pedro and Nueva Segovia, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> attempt to relaunch the coordinated resistance of the 1530s.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} poem <b>is</b> Telephus, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{companion to}} Demeter.|$|R

5|$|This may again {{suggest the}} amphitheatre was flooded, as the {{monument}} referred to {{could be an}} altar of Diana, or Pluto, or of Jupiter Latiaris {{that may have been}} present in the centre of the arena, but Pliny the Elder mentions a bridge in connection with the lake of Augustus, suggesting there <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> island there as well.|$|E
5|$|A further {{cause of}} the Lombard {{migration}} into Italy <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> invitation from Narses. According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite for having been removed by Justinian's successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition, it has been studied with attention by modern scholars, in particular Neil Christie, who see in it a possible record of a formal invitation by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as foederati, to help protect the region against the Franks, an arrangement {{that may have been}} disowned by Justin II after Narses' removal.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> opportunity for {{one or more of the}} guards to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E
50|$|Finally, king Nebmaatre <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{ruler of}} the early 17th dynasty.|$|R
50|$|He <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{member of}} the Loyal Wallaroo Lodge of Oddfellows.|$|R
50|$|Author Miguel de Cervantes <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> crypto-Jew or of crypto-Jewish descent.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the chronicle}} {{indirectly}} implies that Rögnvaldr {{was also a}} son of Finnguala, {{there is evidence that}} strongly suggests that he had a different mother. Within a letter from Óláfr to HenryII, King of England, Óláfr describes Rögnvaldr as a bastard. Further evidence is found within a Gaelic praise-poem of Rögnvaldr, which states that he was a son of Sadb, an otherwise unknown Irishwoman who <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> unrecorded wife or concubine of Guðrøðr. The chronicle records that because Óláfr was only a child {{at the time of his}} father's death, the Manxmen chose Rögnvaldr to rule instead, describing him as a vigorous and hardier man. The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr began his reign the following year, in 1188.|$|E
5|$|Arran has a {{particular}} concentration of early Neolithic Clyde Cairns, a form of Gallery grave. The typical style of these structures is a rectangular or trapezoidal stone and earth mound that encloses a chamber lined with larger stone slabs. Pottery and bone fragments found inside the chambers suggest they were used for interment and some have forecourts, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> area for public display or ritual. There are two good examples in Monamore Glen west of the village of Lamlash, and similar structures called the Giants' Graves above Whiting Bay. There are numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor (Gaelic: Am Machaire).|$|E
5|$|Between {{the early}} 16th {{and the late}} 17th centuries, an {{original}} tradition of stone tented roof architecture developed in Russia. It was quite unique and different from the contemporary Renaissance architecture elsewhere in Europe, though some research terms the style 'Russian Gothic' and compares it with the European Gothic architecture of the earlier period. The Italians, with their advanced technology, may have influenced {{the invention of the}} stone tented roof (the wooden tents were known in Russia and Europe long before). According to one hypothesis, an Italian architect called Petrok Maly <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> author of the Ascension Church in Kolomenskoye, one of the earliest and most prominent tented roof churches.|$|E
