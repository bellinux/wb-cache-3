5|$|Gandhi's {{experiment}} with abstinence went beyond sex, and extended to food. He consulted the Jain scholar Rajchandra, whom he fondly called Raychandbhai. Rajchandra advised him that milk stimulated sexual passion. Gandhi began abstaining from cow's <b>milk</b> <b>in</b> 1912, {{and did so}} even when doctors advised him to consume milk. According to Sankar Ghose, Tagore described Gandhi as someone who did not abhor sex or women, but considered sexual life as inconsistent with his moral goals.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. First, the father's semen curdles the mother's menses, which Aristotle compares with how rennet (an enzyme from a cow's stomach) curdles <b>milk</b> <b>in</b> cheesemaking. This forms the embryo; {{it is then}} {{developed}} {{by the action of}} the pneuma (literally, breath or spirit) in the semen. The pneuma first makes the heart appear; this is vital, as the heart nourishes all other organs. Aristotle observed that the heart is the first organ seen to be active (beating) in a hen's egg. The pneuma then makes the other organs develop.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluated}} fertility and milk performance due to multiple milking technology which was used. The monitoring was carried in 2011 in farms Agrospol, Malý Bor a. s. and the farm Dub. System evaluation of fertility and milk performance of dairy cows at multiple <b>milking</b> were evaluated <b>in</b> 186 lactations of Czech pied cattle breeding. The average number of <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> the parlour was 2. 96 x/day and robot 2. 36 x/day. 107 lactations were obtained during <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> the <b>milking</b> parlour and 79 of lactation during <b>milking</b> by robots. <b>In</b> this thesis were measured indicators of fertility (insemination interval, service period, the mean time and age at first calving) and indicators of milk production (lactation length, the amount of milk fat, protein and lactose content). In the reproductive indicators were taken statistically highly difference in age at first calving, where the average difference was 195 days. For other indicators of fertility were all statistically significant results <b>in</b> favor of <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> the <b>milking</b> parlour (2. 96 x/day). Czech pied cattle <b>milked</b> <b>in</b> the <b>milking</b> parlour per normative lactation average amount of milk produced 8 599. 8 kg, cows milked by robot 7 272. 5 kg. Among these values was statistically highly significant difference. The best results {{in the production of}} milk per normative lactation were gained by <b>milked</b> cows <b>in</b> the <b>milking</b> parlour (9 284. 4 kg) and the second lactation cows <b>milked</b> <b>in</b> the <b>milking</b> parlour (9 033. 0 kg) on the third and more lactation. The lowest <b>milk</b> production <b>in</b> normative lactation gained dairy cows milked by robot at first lactation (6 874. 7 kg). The higher average fat content had dairy cows <b>milked</b> <b>in</b> the <b>milking</b> parlour with a value of 4. 47 %, dairy cows milked by robot had fat content of 4. 15 %. Between these values was statically highly significant difference. In the average protein content in dairy cows has been demonstrated statistically significant difference. Dairy cows <b>milked</b> <b>in</b> the <b>milking</b> parlour reached the value 3. 41 % compared to cows milked by a robot, where the average value of protein was 3. 47 %.

5|$|Governor Deane C. Davis of Vermont {{declared}} a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to assist with cleanup efforts. Blowing snow continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and snow removal vehicles, not equipped to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues. The storm left some communities without power or telephone service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer. One person died in Saxtons River. With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced to discard thousands of gallons of <b>milk.</b> <b>In</b> other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually. One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.|$|E
5|$|In the Neolithic period, {{from around}} 6,000 years ago, there is {{evidence}} of permanent settlements and farming. This includes the well-preserved stone house at Knap of Howar on Papa Westray, dating from around 3500 BCE and the village of similar houses at Skara Brae on West Mainland, Orkney from about 500 years later. Evidence of prehistoric farming includes small plots of improved land, with simple stone boundaries. On Shetland these have been found under peat and on the mainland they are associated with cairnfields (piles of rocks that have been cleared from fields). Archaeological evidence of pollen, pottery, settlements and human remains indicates that the two main sources of food were grain and cow <b>milk,</b> <b>in</b> a pattern that probably remained constant until the High Middle Ages. There is also some limited evidence of the cultivation of flax from this period.|$|E

5|$|By 1980 all {{apart from}} the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland had {{effectively}} completed their programs. In the United Kingdom the breakdown of voluntary metrication in the mid-1970s coincided with the United Kingdom's obligations {{as part of the}} EEC to adopt the metric system, resulting in legislation to force metrication in certain areas and the Eurosceptic movement adopting an anti-metrication stance and the United Kingdom seeking a number of derogations from the relevant EEC directives. Once the metrication of most consumer goods was completed in 2000, aspects of British life, especially in government, commerce and industry used SI. Although imperial units are widely encountered in unregulated areas such as the press and everyday speech, SI or units approved for use alongside SI are used in most areas where units of measure are regulated. High-profile exceptions include the sale of draught beer, the sale of <b>milk</b> <b>in</b> returnable containers, and United Kingdom road signs. Irish road signs (road distances and speeds) were converted to metric units during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century; otherwise, the situation in Ireland is similar to that in the United Kingdom.|$|E

Then-gubernatorial candidate Doyle E. Carlton contributed $10,000 on September20 after surveying the damage. A creamery in West Palm Beach quickly distributed 1,400gallons of <b>milk.</b> <b>In</b> Miami, WQAM hosted a telethon on September22, which also included live entertainment from a Shriners band at a park amphitheater. The event collected about $1,000 for the victims of the storm. The city of Miami also donated 2tanks of chlorine, 20barrels of disinfectant, 24lanterns, and 5,000paper cups. City council members of San Francisco, which suffered from a devastating earthquake in 1906, agreed to donate $10,000 to South Florida without discussion. Issaquena County, Mississippi, among the most ravaged by a Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, also contributed money. Although many railroad stations south of Kelsey City were damaged, train service was restored on the morning of September17. Railroad companies provided free fare to storm victims until October4, a service used by 1,427people. After that day, the Red Cross paid for the transportation of people who were destitute.|$|E
5|$|Milk {{abruptly}} {{stopped working}} as an insurance actuary and became {{a researcher at the}} Wall Street firm Bache & Company. He was frequently promoted despite his tendency to offend the older members of the firm by ignoring their advice and flaunting his success. Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk's heart was not in his work. He started a romantic relationship with Jack Galen McKinley, and recruited him to work on conservative Republican Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. Their relationship was troubled. When McKinley first began his relationship with <b>Milk</b> <b>in</b> late 1964, he was 16 years old. He was prone to depression and sometimes threatened to commit suicide if Milk did not show him enough attention. To make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk's ex-lover, Joe Campbell, was himself recuperating from a suicide attempt, after his lover Billy Sipple left him. Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the avant-garde art scene in Greenwich Village, but Milk did not understand why Campbell's despondency was sufficient cause to consider suicide as an option.|$|E
40|$|Background: Proteomic {{approaches}} {{based on}} mass spectrometry have been recently used in archaeological and art researches, generating promising results for protein identification. Little information {{is known about}} eastward spread and eastern limits of prehistoric <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> eastern Eurasia. Methodology/Principal Finding: In this paper, an ancient visible food remain from Subeixi Cemeteries (cal. 500 to 300 years BC) of the Turpan Basin in Xinjiang, China, preliminarily determined containing 0. 432 mg/kg cattle casein with ELISA, was analyzed by using an improved method based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS to further identify protein origin. The specific sequence of bovine casein and the homology sequence of goat/sheep casein were identified. Conclusions/Significance: The existence of <b>milk</b> component <b>in</b> ancient food implies goat/sheep and cattle <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> ancient Subeixi region, the furthest eastern location of prehistoric <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> the Old World up to date. It is envisioned that this work provides a new approach for ancient residue analysis and other archaeometry field...|$|R

40|$|Oxytocin can {{attenuate}} {{the physiological}} and behavioral response to stress in animals. In {{this study we}} investigated the relationship between plasma oxytocin concentrations and the behavioral and physiological response of dairy cows to a repeated psychological stressor (novel environment). Twenty lactating multi-parous dairy cows were <b>milked</b> <b>in</b> a familiar <b>milking</b> parlor and <b>in</b> a novel environment. Blood samples were collected before and after <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> the familiar parlor (baseline) and on the second and fifth day in the novel parlor to measure plasma cortisol and oxytocin concentrations. Heart rate was recorded on all cows during <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> the familiar and novel environment. On all test days, the behavioral response of cows to milk cluster attachment was scored. On day 2 in the novel parlor, the oxytocin response, cortisol concentrations and heart rate were greater, and heart rate variability was lower than baseline values recorded in the familiar parlor. The {{results from this study}} suggest that oxytocin release is increased in response to exposure to a psychological stressor (novel environment) and that cows adapt to this stressor over time. After initial suppression, oxytocin levels increased over days of <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> a novel environment, whereas indicators of stress simultaneously decreased. Furthermore, the oxytocin increase was associated with habituation of the cortisol response <b>in</b> anticipation of <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> a novel environment, suggesting that oxytocin may be involved in habituation to a novel environment in dairy cows. This mechanism of habituation to novel environments may reflect an association between oxytocin and a "familiarization-habituation response" to repeated exposure to an initially novel environment that has previously been reported in humans...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to {{study the effects of}} catecholamines on oxytocin responses and <b>milk</b> removal <b>in</b> dairy cows. Adrenalin, noradrenalin, dopamine, isoproterenol (a β-adrenoceptor agonist), phentolamine (an α-adrenergic blocker) and propranolol (a β-adrenergic blocker) were infused intravenously. In addition, adrenalin was infused together with phentolamine and/or propranolol. Infusions started 8 min before milking and lasted until the end of <b>milking.</b> <b>In</b> some cases electroshocks (for 5 s) were applied immediately before <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> the absence and presence of phentolamine and propranolol. Adrenalin, noradrenalin and dopamine reduced milk removal, but only if administered in supraphysiological amounts. The effect of adrenalin and electroshocks on milk removal could be inhibited by α-, but not by β-adrenergic blockade. The effect of dopamine could be inhibited only partly by phentolamine. Inhibition of milk removal was not mediated by reduced oxytocin responses.

40|$|In Peru, {{strong growth}} in urban demand for industrially {{processed}} dairy products has induced a rapid increase <b>in</b> <b>milk</b> production {{along the coast}} {{but not so much}} in the Andean highlands, where an increase <b>in</b> <b>milk</b> production would create the greatest benefits. A farm–household optimisation model was used to assess the current and changing competitiveness of milk production on the coast (Arequipa and Lima) and in the highlands (Cajamarca). Results show that large farms on the coast, particularly near Lima, are currently the most profitable. However, the high <b>milk</b> prices <b>in</b> Lima are likely to fall because of local market saturation and reduced competition among regional <b>milk</b> buyers. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>milk</b> prices <b>in</b> Arequipa and Cajamarca are expected to rise as a result of increased milk collection by milk processors since <b>milk</b> production costs <b>in</b> these regions are lower and there is a strong incentive to increasingly substitute expensive imported milk powder with locally produced evaporated <b>milk.</b> Improvements <b>in</b> the rural road system and the promotion of agricultural export crops along the coast, particularly in Arequipa, would accelerate the expansion of <b>milk</b> production <b>in</b> the highlands. To improve highland farmers' access to the market, policy makers and development agencies should target their interventions in close collaboration with milk processors. Because they have a strong interest <b>in</b> increasing <b>milk</b> production <b>in</b> their own region, milk processors are also important partners when designing measures to improve farmers' fodder and herd management practices in order to further increase the competitiveness of <b>milk</b> production <b>in</b> the highlands relative to the coast...|$|R
