5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin rejects for not <b>mirroring</b> the real world.

Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E

The current proposal would create a light rail system in Maryland between the Bethesda and New Carrollton stations by way of Silver Spring and College Park.

5|$|As a {{reflection}} of categories of sexuality so sharply defined {{by the government and}} society at large, lesbian subculture developed extremely rigid gender roles between women, particularly among the working class in the U.S. and Canada. Although many municipalities had enacted laws against cross-dressing, some women would socialize in bars as butches: dressed in men's clothing and <b>mirroring</b> traditional masculine behavior. Others wore traditionally feminine clothing and assumed a more diminutive role as femmes. Butch and femme modes of socialization were so integral within lesbian bars that women who refused to choose between the two would be ignored, or at least unable to date anyone, and butch women becoming romantically involved with other butch women or femmes with other femmes was unacceptable.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis work was to carry out initial studies on Scania’s {{possibility}} to have plastic rearview <b>mirror</b> glasses as that for example may reduce costs and problems for Scania’s customers and enable another design of the <b>mirror</b> assembly. It was performed by studying the legislative and Scania demands regarding rearview <b>mirrors</b> to write a test program, find and order plastic <b>mirrors,</b> and then perform the tests and evaluate the <b>mirrors</b> {{to see if they}} seem good enough for Scania’s trucks. A Scania technical regulation for rearview <b>mirror</b> glass was also written.   The tested <b>mirrors</b> were a Scania glass <b>mirror</b> as reference, a PC <b>mirror</b> from Sabic, a PC and a PMMA <b>mirror</b> from Specchidea, a <b>mirror</b> from SMR automotive, an ABS <b>mirror</b> from Ficocipa/Renault, an ABS <b>mirror</b> from Ford and a PC plastic from Bayer and they were tested for scratch resistance, temperature variations, impact resistance, corrosion and chemical resistance in that order. If a sample did not pass a certain test, it was not subjected to the next one.   Of all samples it was only the SMR <b>mirror</b> and the reference glass <b>mirror</b> that passed the first test (scratch resistance). The others became too scratched and were not tested further. The SMR and the glass <b>mirror</b> also withstood all the following tests very good, the SMR <b>mirror</b> was the best one of the tested <b>mirrors.</b> Probably the SMR <b>mirror</b> was the best one because many of the other <b>mirrors</b> did not seem to have been made for outdoor conditions and because it seemed to be the most modern <b>mirror</b> with a good abrasion resistant coating.   It was concluded that there is a future for plastic <b>mirror</b> glasses, that {{it would be interesting to}} do more tests on the <b>mirrors,</b> for example a UV test and a distortion test, and to test more <b>mirrors</b> as a new generation of plastic <b>mirror</b> glass seem to be underway.
