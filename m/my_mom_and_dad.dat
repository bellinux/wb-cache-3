40|$|This work {{shows how}} a single {{compiler}} front-end and optimization suite {{may be used}} to generate high quality code speci c processors. A C language front-end is used. An initial pass of the compiler is used to instrument the program in order to collect a trace of the dynamic behavior of programs into an execution pro le used to guide later code optimization phases. Generic code optimization techniques are applied, then machine speci c optimizations are performed. Code is then generated using a machine speci c code generator, and then several more machine speci c optimizations are performed. Results gathered in generating code for the Sparc architecture are presented in this work. In spite of an incomplete suite of optimizations, the output code is of comparable overall quality to that generated by the Sun compiler. iii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS <b>My</b> <b>Mom</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dad's</b> encouragement <b>and</b> support enabled me to achieve asmuch asIhave.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{limitation of}} traditional template-based trackers is {{their inability to}} han-dle out-of-plane rotation, which can cause total self-occlusion of the target. We present a simple extension to template-based tracking that overcomes this problem. A forward correlation-based search for computing the transformation (displacement and scale) be-tween two image frames is augmented with a backward correlation-based search for group-ing the pixels with similar image velocities. In effect, the latter performs motion segmen-tation on the pixels around the target to automatically update the model as it changes over time, while avoiding drift. A gradient module assists the algorithm when the background contains little texture. Experimental results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} technique in both textured and untextured environments, with complete self-occlusion caused by full 360 -degree out-of-plane rotation, along with scale changes.

[...] On November 9, 2012, the first regular season for Frazier as a senior, he logged his 19th career 20-point game against Saint Francis (PA). On November 18, Frazier left six minutes into a game against Akron due to a ruptured left Achilles tendon. It was announced that he had a recovery period of about 12 months and would be out for the season. The injury was described as a [...] "devastating blow" [...] to the program by ESPN.com writer Eamonn Brennan. Chambers addressed the situation, saying, [...] "I have no doubt he will meet this challenge and will again be one of the top players in the nation," [...] in accordance to his potential fifth year of NCAA eligibility. Frazier redshirted the season shortly after it was announced by the school that he would undergo surgery. He said, [...] "I will never forget that game, that injury, never forget that camera. I'm sitting there on the sideline with the (television) camera just zooming in on my foot. I'll never forget the look on my sister's face, <b>my</b> <b>mom</b> <b>and</b> <b>dad's</b> face." [...] During his rehabilitation, Frazier began using the elliptical machine, doing work in the swimming pool, and taking part in weight training. He was guided by Penn State's athletic trainer, Jon Salazer, throughout the process.
