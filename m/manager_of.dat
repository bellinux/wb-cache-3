40|$|We live in {{a complex}} world and <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> {{organizations}} are constantly facing numerous challenges. Good decisions, i. e., better outcomes for organizations, require use of the powerful discipline Operational Research (OR) /Management Science (MS). Organizations applying this discipline have achieved significant benefits such as cost reduction, increased revenues, increased market share, higher quality, improved productivity, improved performance, better customer service, etc. The aim {{of this paper is}} to examine whether <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in Macedonia use OR models for supporting decision-making processes, where OR models, methods and techniques are commonly used, and what benefits achieved in using quantitative OR models, methods and techniques. The survey was conducted using a questionnaire distributed electronically to 100 <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> micro, 100 <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> small and 100 <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> medium-sized enterprises. The questionnaires were answered completely by 93 <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> the micro, 73 <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> the small and 71 <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> the medium-sized enterprises, and the questionnaire responses were subsequently analyzed. The answers showed that decisions on running enterprises are made intuitively by 90 % <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> the micro, 78 % <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> the small, and 55 % <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> the medium-sized enterprises, while quantitative OR models for supporting the decision-making process are used by 10 % <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> the micro, 22 % <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> the small, and 45 % <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> the medium-sized enterprises. Applied in the micro, small and medium-sized enterprises are inventory models, time series analysis and forecasting, whereas micro and medium-sized enterprises rely on decision analysis. Small and medium-sized enterprises use break-even analysis, assignation, linear programming, and project management. The OR models and methods used in running the respective enterprises led to the following results: optimal inventory level, cost reductions, revenue growth, forecasted sales, increased sales, production optimization, improved quality, better planning of activities, more efficient allocation of staff, absence of complaints and increased customers satisfaction...|$|R

It is assumed that the cultural values influence the behavior of individuals and the way they perceive their roles. It is important to determine how they perform their activities (Schein, 2004; Thévenet, 1993; Hofstede, 2003). It is also assumed that the comprehension of culture is made easier by the process of comparison (Proulx, 2003; Dupuis & Davel, 2005, Dupuis, 2008). The methodology used is constituted by the use of a closed questionnaire to the public <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> the State of Bahia.
