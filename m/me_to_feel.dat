500|$|The {{day after}} Dyer was {{pulled from the}} gallows she {{wrote a letter to}} the General Court, refusing to accept the {{provision}} of the reprieve. [...] In this letter she wrote, [...] "My life is not accepted, neither availeth me, in comparison with the lives and liberty of the Truth and Servants of the living God for which in the Bowels of Love and Meekness I sought you; yet nevertheless with wicked Hands have you put two of them to Death, which makes <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that the Mercies of the Wicked is cruelty; I rather chuse to Dye than to live, as from you, as Guilty of their Innocent Blood." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Langford's {{death in}} May 1927, Cardus became The Manchester Guardians chief music critic. For several {{years he had}} worked closely with Langford, whose {{influence}} on the younger man was equalled only by that of Ernest Newman, Langford's predecessor as the paper's music critic: [...] "Langford taught <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> and translate, while Newman taught me to observe and analyse". Cardus's fellow-critic Hugo Cole has described his approach as personal rather than academic, based on his own reactions to the music he was hearing, and with a complete independence of judgement. Cardus was, Cole says, [...] "the last distinguished music critic never to have received formal musical training... he was a writer first, and a music critic second".|$|E
2500|$|Jackson's {{religion}} {{has often been}} discussed. His biographer, Robert Lewis Dabney, suggested that [...] "It was the fear of God which made him so fearless of all else." [...] Jackson himself had said, [...] "My religious belief teaches <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> as safe in battle as in bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Charnock; [...] "the {{boys are}} very good! It makes <b>me</b> proud <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> they all like Stephen. But why didn't you {{telegraph}} us? The Company {{would have sent}} on the message." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{entering}} the NFL's substance abuse program, Soward was critical about its effectiveness. [...] "It was horrible counseling. I’ve been in every rehab centre known to man," [...] said Soward. [...] "They {{even had the}} nerve <b>to</b> put <b>me</b> in rehab in Miami, the drug capital of the world. I don’t really think the rehabilitation process is very good for players down there. I think it {{is more of a}} disciplinary kind of rehabilitation which doesn’t teach anybody anything. For me, the more they took away from me the more it made <b>me</b> want <b>to</b> drink, the more it made <b>me</b> want <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> depressed, the more it made <b>me</b> want <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> bad about me." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked if}} he ever tried playing solid-body guitars again, he said [...] "solid bodies are strange <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I need <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the body resonating".|$|R
2500|$|At Columbia University in 1971, Borges further {{elaborated}} on the story's creation, [...] "I {{tried to}} imagine what a real Nazi might be like. I mean someone who thought of violence as being praiseworthy for its own sake. Then I thought that this archetype of the Nazis wouldn't mind being defeated; after all, defeats and victories are mere matters of chance. He would still be glad of the fact, even if the Americans and British won the war. Naturally, when I am with Nazis, I find they are not my idea of what a Nazi is, but this wasn't meant to be a political tract. It was meant to stand for {{the fact that there was}} something tragic in the fate of a real Nazi. Except that I wonder if a real Nazi ever existed. At least, when I went to Germany, I never met one. They were all feeling sorry for themselves and wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> sorry for them as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|People with a dismissive {{style of}} avoidant {{attachment}} {{tend to agree}} with these statements: [...] "I am comfortable without close emotional relationships", [...] "It is [...] important to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> independent and self-sufficient", and [...] "I prefer not to depend on others or have others depend on me." [...] People with this attachment style desire a high level of independence. The desire for independence often appears as an attempt to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient and invulnerable to feelings associated with being closely attached to others. They often deny needing close relationships. Some may even view close relationships as relatively unimportant. Not surprisingly, they seek less intimacy with attachments, whom they often view less positively than they view themselves. Investigators commonly note the defensive character of this attachment style. People with a dismissive–avoidant attachment style tend to suppress and hide their feelings, and they tend to deal with rejection by distancing themselves from the sources of rejection (e.g. their attachments).|$|E
2500|$|It {{was later}} {{announced}} that Sandé had begun writing sessions with Alicia Keys and Chris Martin of Coldplay. Sandé said {{working with the}} pair was like a [...] "dream come true". Simon Cowell showed his support for Sandé {{and said she was}} his [...] "favourite songwriter at the moment". After she began penning tracks for the likes of Cher Lloyd, Susan Boyle, Alexandra Burke and Leona Lewis who are all signed to Cowell's record label, Syco Music. She also revealed that it was never an option to go out and sing other artists' songs which they had written for her. She wanted the whole album to be her own, and every song to be written by herself. She said [...] "For <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> empowered by music, it has to be my own. The message that the lyric carries is as important to me as singing in tune. Not everyone is a writer or wants to be, so shows like that can be a great way of getting exposure – and as we're all aware, this is a tough industry to break into. I just know I'd have found it very difficult to go out and sing other people's songs week after week, though. It simply wouldn't have felt truthful." ...|$|E
6000|$|She smiled. [...] "You must forgive me, Mr. Northcott, {{for having}} {{included}} you among the troublers of my peace. It {{gives me a}} strange pleasure to tell you this; it makes <b>me</b> strong <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that I have your friendship and sympathy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's {{nothing to}} the purpose. My health is done for. There is nothing before me but decline. I have felt that all along, {{whatever}} doctors may say. And how can you expect <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> what I have brought on you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To have debts that I cannot meet. To be {{hammered}} upon 'Change {{and declared}} a bankrupt. To know {{that others have}} a just claim upon <b>me</b> and <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that I dare not meet their eyes. Is not that worse than poverty?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Commentators {{from both}} inside and outside the hip hop {{community}} have criticized the cost of many of the accoutrements of hip hop fashion. Chuck D of Public Enemy summarized the mentality of Hip hop fashion and some low-income youths as [...] "Man, I work at McDonald's, but in order for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> good about myself I got to get a gold chain or I got to get a fly car in order to impress a sister or whatever. [...] " [...] In his 1992 song [...] "Us", Ice Cube rapped that [...] "Us niggaz will always sing the blues / 'cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes". Some fans have expressed disappointment with the increased amount of advertising for expensive hip hop brands in hip hop magazines. In one letter to the editor in Source magazine, a reader wrote that the magazine should [...] "try showing some less expensive brands so heads will know they don't have to hustle, steal, or rob and blast shots for flyness. [...] " [...] In fact, there were many highly publicized robberies of hip hop artists by the late 1990s. Guru of Gang Starr was robbed of his Rolex watch at gunpoint, Queen Latifah's car was car-jacked, and Prodigy was robbed at gunpoint of $300,000 in jewelry.|$|E
2500|$|I was {{not more}} than {{thirteen}} years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners {{in the sight of}} God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise.I consulted a good old colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to [...] "cast all my care upon God." [...] This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.|$|E
60|$|I wrung their hands, {{for it was}} a joy to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that we {{had come}} once more into {{complete}} accord.|$|E
60|$|As Screw obeyed I saw a look pass {{between him}} and the two strangers which made <b>me</b> begin <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> a little uneasy. I thought the doctor noticed it too; but he {{preserved}} his countenance, as usual, in a state of the most unruffled composure.|$|R
60|$|There {{have been}} one or two seasons in my life during which I have {{felt as if the}} {{darkness}} of sorrow and desolation that crushed my inmost heart could never pass away until death should make <b>me</b> cease <b>to</b> <b>feel.</b> The present was such a season.|$|R
60|$|Good music never tires me, nor sends <b>me</b> <b>to</b> sleep. I <b>feel</b> {{physically}} refreshed {{and strengthened}} by it, as Milton says he did.|$|R
60|$|My {{directions}} in the memorandum instructed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{along the line}} traced by the stick, beginning with the end which was nearest to the beacon.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I comprehend,' he said thoughtfully. 'But since, by {{a perverse}} fate, I {{have been thrown}} into your company, you could hardly expect <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> and act otherwise.' ...|$|E
60|$|I was angry,--that {{was not to}} be {{wondered}} at; but it was a {{great relief}} to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that I need not be angry with my secretary.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her steadily, then {{slightly}} shrugged. [...] "What need to wear a mask? Bah! Did he ever give <b>me</b> cause <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> for him?" [...] he asked. [...] "Mother, if one day I have a son of my own, I shall {{see to it that}} he loves me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall ferule me in {{the good}} old-fashioned way; I seldom do it myself, but it may make you {{remember}} better <b>to</b> give <b>me</b> pain than <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> it yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well then--suppose our arbour {{here to be}} {{your great}} {{sensible}} country. I offer you my hand a l'Americaine. It will make <b>me</b> intensely happy <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> you accept it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blessed strong arms," [...] sobbed she at last, [...] "around <b>me!</b> <b>To</b> <b>feel</b> {{something}} left in {{the world}} to protect me; something {{left in the}} world which loves me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gross creature!" [...] I responded, as he {{went about}} the {{preparation}} of supper {{with a degree of}} zest which caused <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that my epithet was well deserved.|$|E
60|$|He snorted once more, causing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{rather like}} royalty {{receiving}} a twenty-one gun salute from the fleet. I can't remember ever having met a better right-and-left-hand snorter.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Copperfield,' said Traddles, turning <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'you <b>feel,</b> I am sure, {{that nothing}} could be more {{reasonable}} or considerate.' ...|$|R
6000|$|ZOO. Something very disagreeable is {{happening}} <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I <b>feel</b> hot all over. I have a horrible impulse to injure you. What {{have you done}} <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will, I truly will! {{and when}} I {{get in a}} worry about things may I come to you? Uncle told <b>me</b> <b>to,</b> and I <b>feel</b> as if I shouldn't be afraid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess it's such {{a little}} {{conscience}} that it don't prick hard enough for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> it," [...] added Rob, after thinking the matter over for a minute.|$|E
6000|$|I do {{not care}} to know who prest you: [...] Enough for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> and know [...] That some heart's love and longing blest you, [...] Knitting to-day with long-ago.|$|E

6000|$|... "You will!" [...] exclaimed the trooper, musing. [...] "Here, give <b>me</b> leave <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{your arm}} above the elbow.

[...] So saying, {{he gave the}} spinster a sudden whirl, that effectually confused all her faculties, until she found herself safely, if not comfortably, seated on the crupper of Lawton's steed.|$|R
60|$|Horne {{wrote the}} article. I shall see him here to-night, {{and know how}} he will feel your sympathy and support. But I do not wait to see him before writing, lest you should think <b>me</b> slow <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> your generosity. We said at home when we read your letter, {{that it was like}} the opening of your whole munificent and bare heart.|$|R
60|$|Selin. Your goodness, O my Ozmyn, is too great; I am not {{weary of}} my fetters yet: Already, {{when you move}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> resign, I <b>feel</b> them heavier on your feet than mine.|$|R
