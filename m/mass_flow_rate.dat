25|$|A {{practical}} {{application of the}} Coriolis effect is the mass flow meter, an instrument that measures the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and density of a fluid flowing through a tube. The operating principle involves inducing a vibration of the tube through which the fluid passes. The vibration, though not completely circular, provides the rotating reference frame that {{gives rise to the}} Coriolis effect. While specific methods vary according to the design of the flow meter, sensors monitor and analyze changes in frequency, phase shift, and amplitude of the vibrating flow tubes. The changes observed represent the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and density of the fluid.|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} research {{demonstrates the}} results of a series of numerical simulations of gas flow through a single-stage centrifugal compressor with a vaneless diffuser. Numerical results were validated with experiments consisting of eight regimes with different <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> The steady-state and unsteady simulations were done in ANSYS FLUENT 13. 0 and NUMECA FINE/TURBO 8. 9. 1 for one-period geometry due to periodicity of the problem. First-order discretization is insufficient due to strong dissipation effects. Results obtained with second-order discretization agree with the experiments for the steady-state case in the region of high <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> In the area of low <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> nonstationary effects significantly influence the flow leading stationary model to poor prediction.

30|$|The <b>Mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of CO 2 has a {{significant}} effect on reaction temperature. The reaction temperature decreases from 1645 to 1329  °C when CO 2 <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> increases from 0 to 5  kg/h because of the slower diffusion of O 2 in CO 2 atmosphere, larger heat capacity of CO 2 and promoting of Boudouard reaction.

25|$|Axial flow {{compressors}} {{produce a}} continuous flow of compressed gas, {{and have the}} benefits of high efficiency and large <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> particularly {{in relation to their}} size and cross-section. They do, however, require several rows of airfoils to achieve a large pressure rise, making them complex and expensive relative to other designs (e.g. centrifugal compressors).|$|E
25|$|As a flow in {{a channel}} becomes supersonic, one {{significant}} change takes place. The conservation of <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> leads one {{to expect that}} contracting the flow channel would increase the flow speed (i.e. making the channel narrower results in faster air flow) and at subsonic speeds this holds true. However, once the flow becomes supersonic, the relationship of flow area and speed is reversed: expanding the channel actually increases the speed.|$|E
25|$|A flow bench {{consists}} of an air pump of some sort, a metering element, pressure and temperature measuring instruments such as manometers, and various controls. The test piece is attached in series with the pump and measuring element and air is pumped through the whole system. Therefore, all the air passing through the metering element also passes through the test piece. Because the volume flow rate through the metering element is known and the flow through the test piece is the same, it is also known. The <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> can be calculated using the known pressure and temperature data to calculate air densities, and multiplying by the volume flow rate.|$|E

A transition in {{the dependence of}} flame height on heat input and burner size was observed when the flame height was about four times the burner diameter. The <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> in the buoyant plumes produced by the fires were measured {{for a range of}} elevations starting just below the time-averaged top of the flame and extending to six times this flame height.

40|$|Abstract—A {{parametric}} {{study of}} a mixed-compression supersonic inlet is performed and reported. The effects of inlet Mach Numbers, varying from 4 to 10, and angle of attack, varying from 0 to 10, are reported for a constant inlet dynamic pressure. The paper looked at the variations of <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> through the inlet, gain in entropy through the inlet, and the angles of the external oblique shocks. The <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> were found to decrease monotonically with Mach numbers and increase with angle of attacks.

25|$|Where Q0 = <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> (kg/s), m0 = mass loading (kg/m2), sb = belt speed (m/s) and Lsludge0 = initial {{width of}} sludge across the belt (m). Thus to {{maintain}} industrial scale economic throughput at lower belt speed, the mass loading and width of sludge across the belt must be increased. It {{has been found}} that increasing the solids loading slightly decreases the dry solids concentration of the cake while significantly increasing the potential for sludge to overflow the belt. Lateral migration of sludge on the belt is a measure of how the sludge spreads across the width of the belt. Increased lateral sludge migration means that sludge is escaping the edge of the belt and overflowing into the filtrate. Therefore, increased lateral sludge migration negatively impacts filtrate quality and dry solids recovery.|$|E
25|$|Cubic {{feet per}} minute (CFM) is an often {{confusing}} term {{because it has}} no single definition that applies to all instances. Gases are compressible, which means that a figure in cubic feet per minute cannot necessarily be compared with another figure when it comes {{the mass of the}} gas. To further confuse the issue, a centrifugal fan is a constant CFM device or a constant volume device. This means that, provided the fan speed remains constant, a centrifugal fan will pump a constant volume of air. This {{is not the same as}} pumping a constant mass of air. Again, the fan will pump the same volume, though not mass, at any other air density. This means that the air velocity in a system is the same even though <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> through the fan is not.|$|E
