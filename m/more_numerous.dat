5|$|Hasdrubal led the Iberian and Gaulish cavalry on {{the left}} (south near the Aufidus River) of the Carthaginian army.

5|$|In {{the orders}} that {{branched}} off before the lilioid monocots, the Acorales and Alismatales, flowers differ in several ways. In some cases, like Acorus (Acorales), {{they have become}} insignificant. In others, like Butomus (Alismatales), they have six coloured tepals, and so could be called 'petaloid', but stamens and carpels are <b>more</b> <b>numerous</b> than in the lilioid monocots.|$|E
5|$|Originating {{from central}} European lowlands, the Funnelbeaker people {{were able to}} utilize large expanses of less fertile soils, {{obtained}} by extensive reduction of forested areas, with the increased role of livestock. They moved south into the regions previously developed by the Danubian cultures, {{all the way to}} Bohemia and Moravia. Being <b>more</b> <b>numerous,</b> better fit for the environment, organized and economically more productive, the Funnelbeaker culture people replaced the Danubian cultures in their late phase.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Groton Heights (also {{known as}} the Battle of Fort Griswold, and {{occasionally}} called the Fort Griswold massacre) was a battle of the American Revolutionary War fought on September 6, 1781, between a small Connecticut militia force led by Lieutenant Colonel William Ledyard and the <b>more</b> <b>numerous</b> British forces led by Brigadier General Benedict Arnold and Lieutenant Colonel Edmund Eyre.|$|E

5|$|The Prosaurolophus-Saurolophus clade {{has been}} a {{problematic}} grouping when trying to place among hadrosaurines. Many skull features are similar to Edmontosaurus, while other are closer to Gryposaurus, so the group has been classified as close to both. However, the clade might be closer to Edmontosaurus, as the features are <b>more</b> <b>numerous</b> uniting them.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} Martin Harlinghausen saw {{operations}} expand, targeting Alicante, Almeria, Barcelona and Cartegena.

In total, eleven men were killed in action, and five others died due to accident or illness.|$|E
5|$|The black currawong is {{evaluated}} as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. One of its subspecies, Strepera fuliginosa colei of King Island, {{has declined}} {{over much of}} its range on King Island, possibly due to clearing of its forest habitat, and has been listed as Vulnerable.

5|$|The favored {{sources of}} {{recruitment}} for the cavalry of the auxilia were Gauls, Germans, Iberians and Thracians.

5|$|Although Callisto is {{very similar}} in bulk {{properties}} to Ganymede, it apparently had a much simpler geological history. The surface {{appears to have been}} shaped mainly by impacts and other exogenic forces. Unlike neighboring Ganymede with its grooved terrain, there is little evidence of tectonic activity. Explanations that have been proposed for the contrasts in internal heating and consequent differentiation and geologic activity between Callisto and Ganymede include differences in formation conditions, the greater tidal heating experienced by Ganymede, and the <b>more</b> <b>numerous</b> and energetic impacts that would have been suffered by Ganymede during the Late Heavy Bombardment. The relatively simple geological history of Callisto provides planetary scientists with a reference point for comparison with other more active and complex worlds.|$|E

5|$|Although the British {{ships were}} {{substantially}} larger than any individual French vessel, the frigates were <b>more</b> <b>numerous</b> and more manoeuvrable. Neither side {{could afford to}} take significant damage in the battle, so each sought to drive the other off rather than achieve an outright victory. On 9 September Sercey's frigates formed a line of battle, successfully engaging first Arrogant and then Victorious and inflicting damage on each while preventing them from supporting one another. The French frigates, particularly Vertu and Seine, also suffered and by late morning both sides disengaged, the British retiring to Madras for repairs while Sercey anchored at King's Island in the Mergui Archipelago, eventually sheltering in Batavia.|$|E
5|$|Another fossil {{from the}} Yixian Formation {{provides}} direct evidence of Psittacosaurus as a prey animal. One skeleton of Repenomamus robustus, a large triconodont mammal, is preserved with {{the remains of}} a juvenile Psittacosaurus in its abdominal cavity. Several of the juvenile's bones are still articulated, indicating that the carnivorous mammal swallowed its prey in large chunks. This specimen is notable in that it is the first known example of Mesozoic mammals preying on live dinosaurs. Heavy predation on juvenile Psittacosaurus may have resulted in R-selection, the production of <b>more</b> <b>numerous</b> offspring to counteract this loss.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, from July to October 1940, the Spitfire was {{perceived}} by the public {{to be the main}} RAF fighter, though the <b>more</b> <b>numerous</b> Hawker Hurricane shouldered a greater proportion of the burden against Nazi Germany's air force, the Luftwaffe. Spitfire units, however, had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of its higher performance. During the Battle, Spitfires in general were tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fightersmainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E series aircraft which were a close match for them.|$|E
