In February 1934, Time called her [...] "a rotund lady with a husky voice, a peremptory manner, baggy clothes", a description that wounded Hickok. In a letter to Hopkins' secretary, she asked, [...] "Why the Hell CAN'T they leave me alone?" [...] Following the incident, Hickok and Roosevelt redoubled their efforts to keep their relationship out of the spotlight; on one occasion, Roosevelt wrote to her, [...] "we must must be careful this summer & keep it out of the papers when we are off together.|$|E

Closer to the election, however, he expressly stated that God had told him that Mitt Romney would win and would be a two-term President.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Fanning caused {{controversy}} when {{he chose}} to become a judge on television talent show You're a Star, to choose that year's act to represent Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest. He explained his decision: It’s indefensible. I just can’t defend this at all. It’s Eurovision for God’s sake. It’s all shite, everyone knows that. But I just don't care. I'm doing it for a laugh. Of course I'm going to get people slagging me off, but I'm used to all that. [...] I just thought, why not do it?" [...] he says. [...] "I've done everything else at this stage, including the Mercury Music Prize, IMRO Showcases and battle of the bands contests {{up and down the}} country. When I did 2TV from 1995 until 2000 I presided over the worst five years in 50 years of pop music history. It was all Boyzone videos and I'd slag them all to death. Then they'd be in with <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> week and I'd say 'lads, you're brilliant – three number ones in a row, well done'. I actually like Ronan and I like Keith as people, but I don't like their music. Everyone knows that.

2500|$|Keith Uhlich from Slant Magazine was {{positive}} to both season {{one and three}} of Millennium, giving them both {{four out of five}} stars and calling season one: [...] "We are racing toward an apocalypse of our own creation. This is who we are." [...] Mike Drucker from IGN called the second season a combination of the [...] "X-Files and the violent paranoia of Se7en." [...] Variety reviewer Jeremy Gerard compared the show to Twin Peaks and was overall positive to the series, but said [...] "I just wish it were a little more fun, that I didn't have this nagging feeling that it wants to hurt <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> time I come around." [...] Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly gave the show a B and said it had [...] "great visuals and a commanding performance by Henriksen." [...] Justine Elias from The New York Times was mostly positive to the series and said [...] "If The X-Files, with its offbeat humor and conspiracy theories, wonders about those things that go bump in the night, Millennium explores the darkness – and embraces it." [...] Daily Nebraskan said in their review that the show had [...] "a lot of potential: a good lead actor, a solid premise and a feel that will keep audiences glued to their televisions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, {{tell him to}} stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back. We used to make about 90 minute calls".|$|E
