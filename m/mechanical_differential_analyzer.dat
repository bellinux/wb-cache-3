[...] Mauchly wrote a proposal and in June 1943 he and Goldstine secured funding from the Army [...] for the project. The ENIAC was built in 30 months with 200,000 man hours. The ENIAC was huge, measuring 30 by 60 feet and weighing 30 tons with 18,000 vacuum tubes. The device could only store 20 numbers and took days to program. It was completed in late 1945 as World War II {{was coming to an}} end.|$|E
50|$|Harold Locke Hazen (August 1, 1901 - February 21, 1980) was an American {{electrical}} engineer. He {{contributed to}} the theory of servomechanisms and feedback control systems. In 1924 under the lead of Vannevar Bush, Hazen and his fellow undergraduate Hugh H. Spencer built a prototype AC network analyzer, a special-purpose analog computer for solving problems in interconnected AC power systems. Hazen also worked with Bush over twenty years on such projects as the <b>mechanical</b> <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer.</b>|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} an amazing {{development}} of modeling and simulation from its beginning in the 1920 s, when the technology was available only at a handful of University groups who had access to a <b>mechanical</b> <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer.</b> Today, tools for modeling and simulation are available for every student and engineer. This paper gives a perspective on the development with particular emphasis on technology and paradigm shifts. Modeling is increasingly important for design and operation of complex natural and man-made systems. Because of {{the increased use of}} model based control such as Kalman filters and model predictive control, models are also appearing as components of feedback systems.

25|$|The <b>differential</b> analyser, a <b>mechanical</b> analog {{computer}} designed to solve differential equations by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms {{to perform the}} integration. In 1876 James Thomson had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, {{but he had been}} stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators. In a <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer,</b> the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others developed <b>mechanical</b> <b>differential</b> <b>analyzers.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} hunting network {{method to}} analyze the behavior of poly-phase induction machine {{under the influence of}} a periodic pulsating torque. The differential equation, which describes the dynamic behavior of induction machine, is nonlinear and until the advent of <b>mechanical</b> <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer</b> in the early 1940 ’s, it was not feasible to solve these equations. Now solution of these equations is common place using either digital or analog computers. In this paper digital simulation of induction machine dynamics using MATLAB package is analyzed. The calculation method is outlined to predict the current, power and torque pulsation along with power factor and slip. While considering induction generator driven by a diesel engine, a large error can occur in the prediction of current, power and torque pulsation if the induction generator steady state characteristics are used in the analytical solution. A numerical solution in which the induction generator is analyzed by using hunting network method...|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1927, Bush {{constructed}} a <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer,</b> an analog computer that could solve differential equations {{with as many}} as 18 independent variables. This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R. Stewart, one of Bush's masters students, who at Bush's suggestion created the integraph, a device for solving first-order differential equations, in 1925. Another student, Harold Hazen, proposed extending the device to handle second-order differential equations. Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention, for these were much more difficult to solve, but also quite common in physics. Under Bush's supervision, Hazen was able to construct the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer,</b> a table-like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation. Unlike earlier designs that were purely <b>mechanical,</b> the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer</b> had both electrical and mechanical components. Among the engineers who made use of the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer</b> was General Electric's Edith Clarke, who used it to solve problems relating to electric power transmission. For developing the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer,</b> Bush was awarded the Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1928.|$|R
