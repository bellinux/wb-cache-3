Another method is forge welding with a die, whereas the pieces of metal are heated and then forced into a die which both provides the pressure for the weld and keeps the joint at the finished shape. Roll welding is another forge welding process, where the heated metals are overlapped and passed through rollers at high pressures to create the weld.|$|R
40|$|A new seismic {{reflection}} {{survey for}} imaging deeper {{levels of the}} end-glacial Pärvie fault system in northern Sweden was acquired in June 2014. The Pärvie fault system hosts the largest fault scarp so far documented in northern Scandinavia, {{both in terms of}} its length and calculated magnitude of the earthquake that generated it. Present-day microearthquakes occur {{along the length of the}} fault scarp on the eastern side of the scarp, in general agreement with an east-dipping main fault. In the central section of the fault system, where there is a number of subsidiary faults east of the main Pärvie scarp, it has been unclear how the earthquakes relate to the structures mapped at the surface. A seismic profile across the Pärvie fault system acquired in 2007, with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>hammer</b> as a source, showed a good correlation between the surface mapped faults and moderate to steeply dipping reflections. The most pronounced reflectors could be mapped to about 3 km depth. In the new seismic survey, for deeper penetration an explosive source with a maximum charge size of 8. 34 kg in 20 m deep shot holes was used. Reflectors can now be traced to deeper levels with the main 65 ° east-dipping fault interpreted as a weakly reflective structure. As in the previous profile, there is a strongly reflective 60 ° west-dipping structure present to the east of the main fault that can now be mapped to about 8 km depth. Extrapolations of the main and subsidiary faults converge at a depth of about 11. 5 km, where current earthquake activity is concentrated, suggesting their intersection has created favorable conditions for seismic stress release.

40|$|The Bell Jar Orchestra {{focuses on}} aesthetising the {{materiality}} of sound. It brings a heightened visibility to the physicality {{of sound and}} explores the construction of meaning {{in relation to the}} medium through which sound travels. The instruments draw reference to the historicity of science and in particular the beginnings of modern science in the 17 th century. The 17 th century gave rise to the empirical laboratory, a place for the observation and measurement of physical phenomena. This period questioned the value of speculative rationalism and proposed a methodology for empirical enquiry through demonstrable and repeatable laboratorial experiments. It gave rise to a set fundamental laws which established the cornerstones of modern science. One such law, Boyle’s Law, by Irishman Robert Boyle, describes the inverse relationship between air pressure and volume. The apparatus of Robert Boyle’s laboratory was typical of a 17 th century natural philosopher; air pumps, bell jars, test tubes, thermometers and barometers, devices to carry out experiments with air pressure, heat, vacuums etc. One aspect of the research project is to allow for a deepened investigation and appropriation of the methodologies of 17 th century science and to employ the apparatus, techniques and scientific laws of the 17 th century to manipulate and structure sonic material into musical form. This research works toward the construction of a series of compositions for a bell jar orchestra. Inside each bell jar will be an automated <b>mechanical</b> <b>hammer</b> striking a tuned bell. The volume of sound emitting from each bell jar is contingent upon the air pressure inside the bell jar. The air pressure inside the bell jar is controlled by air pumps. When the bell jar is a vacuum no sound is heard, when the bell jar is filled with air, the sound will be at its loudest. By dynamically controlling the flow of air through the bell jars, the loudness and softness of the sound can be controlled, producing a rich, dynamically changing interlacing of sonic material across all 8 bell jars. The ebb and flow of musical loudness and softness is a function of air pressure inside the bell jars. The research recontextualises the intellectual heritage of the 17 th century scientific enlightenment and aestheticises the scientific methodologies, apparatus and laws which stem from the 17 th century...|$|E

5000|$|Raising is a {{metalworking}} technique whereby {{sheet metal}} is formed over a stake or other solid object by repeated 'courses' of hammering and annealing.

This technique is an essential part of silversmithing and is used to create seamless vessels such as vases, cups, bowls, carafes, pitchers, euers, etc.|$|R
40|$|With {{the extreme}} {{miniaturization}} of parts, components, devices and systems in various {{fields such as}} electronics and medicine; machining and fabrication of nano-scale features have gained tremendous attention. The development of cost-effective methods {{that are capable of}} writing or replicating nano-structures {{in a wide range of}} materials represents one of the greatest technical challenges now facing nano-fabrication. There has been a growing interest in using scanning probe microscopes (SPMs) as tools for nanofabrication. This dissertation 2 ̆ 7 s research is an attempt to utilize the principles of electric discharge machining (EDM) and electro chemical machining (ECM) to machine at nanoscale using the atomic force microscope (AFM). The experiments included machining an array of cavities using a single tip, machining of grooves, 2 D machining, micro machining, and studying the effect of electrostatic forces on machining. ^ The experiments setup included: A Multimode AFM as the machining platform, deionized water as the machining medium, samples made of copper and gold films, and conductive AFM probes used as the machining tools. All the experiments were conducted at room temperature and pressure. Each machining experiment was done by first scanning the sample in deionized water. One of four proposed methods was then chosen to set the desired gap distance prior machining. The voltage was then applied between the tip and the workpiece for the specified time. Finally, another scan was taken to the sample to reveal the topographical effects induced by the tip-to-substrate bias. ^ Machining a series of cavities using a single tip was achieved and the depths of the machined cavities ranged between 17 nm and 53 nm. A study was conducted to investigate the stability of the machined nano cavities. It was found that these features were stable within the 48 hours time frame of the experiment and scanning itself played a major role in features destruction. Nano-grooves as deep as 54 nm, as wide as 300 nm, and as long as 13 μm were successfully machined. The length of the groove was limited by the maximum scan size of the AFM scanner. There was a high consistency in the groove 2 ̆ 7 s width and depth across the groove. Mechanical scratching was found to be not involved in grooves machining. ^ Machining in deionized water led to uncertainty about the mechanism of the machining process. The most two probable mechanisms involved in the machining process were EDM and <b>mechanical</b> <b>hammering</b> due to the electrostatic forces. It is expected that the electro-machining process using the AFM can be extended to other conducting tool materials such as copper, cobalt and nickel, and to be capable of machining any electrically conductive material including hard and difficult-to-cut materials. ...|$|R

This experiment used two <b>mechanical</b> mills including <b>hammer</b> mill and disc mill. Before it is milled, coffee was mixed with other materials including corn and rice. Parameters observed were yield, moisture content, bulk density, and angle of respose, particle uniformity index, fineness modulus, and the average particle dimensions.

Bulk density of coffee powder resulted using disc mill was higher compared with hammer mill. However, particle generated from milling process may be categorized as powder with medium cohesiveness based on its angle of repose. Dimensional average particle is proportional to the fineness modulus of coffee powder produced. Highest fineness modulus obtained from coffee powder without additives, and using a hammer mill is equal to 4. 37 with the highest average dimensions of 2. 05 mm, while the lowest fineness modulus that the coffee powder without any additional ingredients milled with a hammer mill is equal to 4. 22, with the lowest average dimensions of 1. 94 mm...|$|R

A challenge can be poor colorfastness. Even though this is a popular technique with several writings on the process, we could find no research examining colorfastness properties. Thus, we examined orange cosmos petals and purple sweet potato leaf pounded onto cotton print cloth for colorfastness to laundering and light exposure following AATCC procedures. Fabric was scoured and mordanted with aluminum acetate. Following pounding, three post-treatments were applied, including steam, a sodium silicate fixative, and a cationic dye fixative. CIELab color coordinates were taken with a spectrocolorimeter. Cosmos exposed to laundering and light had considerable color change with steam having the most similar color ratings and appearance to its standard. Purple sweet potato leaves had noticeable color change following laundering, with steam retaining original color and imagery best. Conversely, colorfastness to light was poor for all treatments. Overall, a steam treatment is recommended to assist with color and image retention for pounded plants onto cotton fabric that is scoured and mordanted with aluminum acetate...|$|R
40|$|The Standard Penetration Test (SPT) {{has been}} a staple of {{geotechnical}} engineering practice for more than 70 years. Empirical correlations based on in situ SPT data provide an important basis for assessment of {{a broad range of}} engineering parameters, and for empirically based analysis and design methods spanning a significant number of areas of geotechnical practice. Despite this longstanding record of usage, the test itself is relatively poorly standardized with regard to the allowable variability of specific details of equipment and procedures, and this requires a number of adjustments or corrections to further standardize this "standard" test. In addition, for many engineering purposes, it is also useful or necessary to "normalize" the penetration resistance measured by SPT in order to account for the influence of effective vertical effective overburden stress at the depth where an individual SPT is performed. This research addressed two of corrections and adjustments that can be applied to SPT: (1) normalization of measured penetration resistances to account for effective overburden stress, and (2) corrections of SPT data for the effects of variations in hammer energy successfully transferred into the rods during driving due to "short rod" effects. The development of procedures and relationships for normalization of SPT penetration data for effects of effective overburden stress dates back more than 60 years, and a number of top geotechnical experts of the past six decades have weighed in on this issue. Despite this long history, current normalization relationships are not based on very extensive data sets, and they are based largely on data for clean sands only (SW and SP) and so do not necessarily represent a suitable basis for overburden normalization of SPT for silty soils (SP-SM, SP-SC, SM and ML) which can be of significant interest in a number of problem areas including, but not limited to, soil liquefaction engineering. The approach taken here was to first re-evaluate the important data developed by Marcuson and Bieganousky (1977) based on large-scale laboratory calibration chamber tests of SPT performed on three clean sands. Then the resulting overburden normalization relationships developed were further examined by cross-comparison with several additional sets of field (in situ) SPT data. To extend these types of relationships to silty soils, data were next gathered for six silty foundation soil strata beneath major dams, where the overlying (largely trapezoidal) earthen dam embankments provided the needed broad ranges of effective overburden stresses within foundation strata that were judged to be suitably laterally geologically continuous as to provide a basis for development of these types of relationships. In the end, {{it was found that the}} new relationships developed for "silty" soils, with suitable fines adjustments (similar to the fines adjustments currently employed in widely used SPT-based liquefaction triggering correlations), match relatively well with the newly developed relationships for overburden stress normalization of SPT data for cleaner sands. The issue of short rod effects has a shorter history, having first been broached by Schmertmann and his colleagues in the early 1970 's. Considerable additional work has followed, and with ongoing advances in both the availability of improved instrumentation (especially high frequency accelerometers) and of analytical methods, it has become clear that earlier measurement and analytical methods developed prior to about the mid- 1980 's overestimated to some extent the reduction in hammer energy delivery for conditions wherein rods were "short" (less than about 45 feet in length). With improved modern accelerometers, we are now able to fully track the very high frequency accelerations produced by steel to steel hammer/anvil impacts, and as a result it is now no longer necessary to make simplifying assumptions that had been intrinsic in pre- 1986 measurements and analyses. It is now possible to trace hammer energy (and wave travel) up and down the rods for multiple cycles of wave travel and to account for additional hammer energy transferred into and out from the rods until the entire "event" had been concluded. Debate has ensued as to the magnitude of actual hammer energy correction that is appropriate now that this improved measurement data is becoming available. The approach taken here was to gather instrumented hammer energy data from SPT performed, under closely controlled conditions, for purposes of "calibration" of automatic (<b>mechanical)</b> <b>hammers.</b> The resulting data show that short rods effects are indeed somewhat less significant then had previously been postulated, but that this reduction in short rods effects is less pronounced that has been postulated by a number of recent papers. An additional finding, also of engineering significance, is that "common practice" with regard to performing of SPT for purposes of calibration of automatic hammers often does not properly account for short rod effects, and that this can produce a conservative bias in SPT data when these hammers are subsequently used for actual engineering investigations. Recommendations are presented for (a) new short rod corrections, and (b) for hammer energy calibration testing of automatic SPT hammer systems...|$|R
