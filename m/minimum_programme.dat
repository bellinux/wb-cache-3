It examines what anti-drugs programmes exist in the district of Znojmo, whether schools follow the Framevork Educational <b>Programme,</b> how the <b>Minimum</b> Preventive <b>Programme</b> performs and what the primary prevention is. The objective of the thesis is to evaluate how the <b>Minimum</b> Preventive <b>Programme</b> is conducted at schools. Three hypotheses were raised in respect of the objective. The first hypothesis focused on the issue whether education of pupils in the area of primary prevention was sufficient. The second hypothesis addressed the question whether the <b>Minimum</b> Preventive <b>Programme</b> condukted at schools was implemented by teachers while the third hypotesis was focused on the issue how often schools invited specialist to cooperate in the programmes. The data were obtained by means of questionnaire research and interview with teachers. The questionnaire research took place at five schools in the district of Znojmo { [...] } at three basic schools (Šumná, Kravsko and Václavské náměstí), one practical basic school (Znojmo) and one gramar school (Znojmo). The research was conducted among both the pupils and the teachers. The structure of the questions allowed mutual confirmation of rebuttal of answers providet by pupils and teachers. From the conducted research it follows that education of pupils at schools in the area of anti-drug prevention is insufficient; both teachers and pupils stated that the anti-drug prevention was conducted minimally within classes. At schools, the <b>Minimum</b> Preventive <b>Programmes</b> are run by teachers. Schools invite specialists to cooperate in the <b>Minimum</b> Preventive <b>Programmes</b> only once or twice a year; more frequent lectures are exceptional.

Using data gathered for the <b>minimum</b> income <b>programme</b> of the Madrid Government, this paper aims to broach various questions arising from the issue of welfare recidivism. After setting out a theoretical framework alternative to models based on single spells and presenting the combined effect of the recipients’ first spell, macroeconomic conditions and socio-demographic characteristics, various econometric procedures are used to answer two fundamental questions: which characteristics have an influence over the probability of returning to the programmes, and what factors determine that the off-welfare duration should differ substantially among recidivist households. The simulations conducted with alternative scenarios place policymakers chances of lengthening the off-welfare spells if macroeconomic shocks occur into perspective. However, the experience of the first spell and, to a lesser extent, employability can indeed contribute towards lengthening the time former recipients spend outside the programme. welfare, recidivism, survival analysis, unobserved heterogeneity. ...|$|R
