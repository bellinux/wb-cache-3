For example, industrial process monitoring data transmission for online control can only tolerate the latency no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>tens</b> of milliseconds [5]. Thus, they require higher transmission priority than other monitoring data which may allow long latency, such as the machine health monitoring data. Priority-aware schemes are often used to tackle the differentiated data transmission. However, it is still challenging to coordinate the multichannel access while meeting the priority-aware transmission requirement due {{to the complexity of}} collision avoidance and transmission prioritization.|$|R

Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece. The Apaches were loud in their support. The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them.|$|E
