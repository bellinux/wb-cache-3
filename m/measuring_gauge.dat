5000|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{flood in}} Boulder {{was the great}} flood of 1894 which came down Boulder Canyon. It wiped out Canyon Street, then known as Water Street, and flooded most of the downtown area. In 1965 another flood hit Colorado which {{was similar to the}} 2013 flood. Colorado is a semi arid dry gulch state and has had a history of flash floods. The Big Thompson River begins around Estes Park in northern Colorado and flows east through the state into Big Thompson Canyon. On July 31, 1976, meteorological conditions similar to what happened in September 2013 caused what is now called the Big Thompson Flood of 1976. In the first hour alone, 8 inches of rainfall was recorded for a total of 12 inches during the first three hours. The flash flooding killed 144 people and caused $35 million worth of damage in 1977 US dollar values, or roughly $140 million in 2013. Comparatively, the 2013 Flooding was caused by approximately 15 inches of rainfall over the span of a week which killed 8 people and caused $2 billion in damage. The rainfall in 2013 was clearly more than that in 1976. However, the flooding was more intensive in 1976 because the rainfall that fell occurred in a much shorter time frame and caught many people off guard. In 2013, The Big Thompson River experienced peak flow rates near Loveland, CO of 4,500 CFS (127.43 cubic meters per second) before the <b>measuring</b> <b>gauge</b> was destroyed by floodwaters. [...] In 1976, the same area of the river saw peak flow rates of 31,200 cubic feet per second (883.49 cubic meters per second). As a result, this is not the worst flooding Colorado has seen, but it is the heaviest rainfall Colorado has seen.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the usage of}} acoustic emission measurement in monitoring sliding contact behaviour in mechanical face seal. The mechanical face seal works normally in boundary lubrication region. If the leakage rate of the seal rises hydrodynamic lubrication takes part in the sliding contact. Correspondingly if the cooling water disappears it can lead in to dry contact situation. These kind of situations can appear in failures of seals. Usually the cooling liquid in mechanical face seal is water. In high temperatures the sliding contact becomes unstable because of cavitation in the lubrication region. The cavitation is result of the boiling of the lubricant in the contact. This cavitation can affect severe wear in the sliding materials. The <b>measuring</b> <b>gauge</b> was situated quite near the sliding contact {{because of the high}} frequency acoustic emission signal attenuates very quickly in boundary surfaces.

Taking the use of feminist fiction as a conscious raising resource during the second wave of feminism in Canada, the United States and England as a starting point, I look to the canon of feminist fiction of Haiti as an unmined resource that may be used for similar purposes. I argue that texts within this canon may be used in the same way if it can be shown that they deal with the evolution or manifestation of feminist (oppositional) consciousness through the narratives of female protagonists. As such, I undertake the qualitative content analysis of five texts from five Haitian female authors using, as a <b>measuring</b> <b>gauge,</b> the four elements of minimal oppositional consciousness as put forward and defined by Mansbridge (2001).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{marginal}} sealing ability of two conventional and one polyacid-modified resin-based composite, and two conventional and three resin-modified glass-ionomers in conventional cylindrical box cavities following a silver-staining microleakage evaluation method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 80 freshly extracted and caries-free human third molars, three standardized cylindrical butt-joint cavities were prepared: the first cavity in coronal enamel, the second at the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) {{and the third}} completely in root cementum. A control group of 10 additional teeth was chosen. After the cavities were restored randomly using the eight restorative materials tested, the specimens were first stored in distilled water at 37 degrees C for 7 days and then thermocycled (500 cycles). Thereafter, the specimens were centrifuged for 10 min in plastic bottles containing 50 wt% silver nitrate aqueous solution. The degree of microleakage was recorded at four different depths along the restoration margins using an optical stereomicroscope equipped with a <b>measuring</b> <b>gauge.</b> RESULTS: None of the tested systems prevented microleakage completely, but the extent of leakage decreased towards {{the bottom of the}} restorations. The resin-modified glass-ionomers performed better than the conventional resin-based composites and conventional glass-ionomers.

Methods: Twenty-four sound upper premolar teeth with Class II cavities were allocated to three groups (n = 8). Restoration of the teeth involved the placement of an RBC (GrandioSO) in eight oblique increments (Group A) or Groups B and C were restored to within 2 mm of the palatal cusp in a single increment with bulk-fill flowable RBC bases (SDR and x-tra base) before the two occlusal cavity increments were placed with GrandioSO. Buccal and palatal cusp deflections were recorded postirradiation using a twin channel deflection <b>measuring</b> <b>gauge.</b> Following restoration, the teeth were thermocycled, immersed in 0. 2 % basic fuchsin dye for 24 h, sectioned and examined for cervical microleakage Results: The mean total cuspal deflection for the oblique incremental restoration technique was 11. 26 (2. 56) ?m (Group A) and 4. 63 (1. 19) ?m (Group B) and 4. 73 (0. 99) ?m (Group C) for the bulk-fill flowable RBC bases.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of the electro less deposition of chromium onto aluminum was investigated {{in order to improve}} non-printing element properties. It was determined that the electrochemical deposition of trivalent chromium was possible from alkaline solutions. The presence of chromium was confirmed by the EDAX procedure in three different laboratories. The influence of chromium on the wet ability of the nonprinting elements of the printing form was examined by drop spreading. Specimens were examined by pouring distilled water in drops onto the surface of the specimen. The picture of the drop was taken by a digital camera from two directions, in order to measure the diameter of the spreaded drop (a <b>measuring</b> <b>gauge</b> was recorded together with the drop) and contact angle. The chromium-treated samples showed increased wettability compared with the non-chromium-treated samples. Improvement of the non-printing elements was confirmed during a printing test that was performed under real printing conditions. The purity of the prints made by two types of printing forms was analyzed in two ways: based on densitometric measurements and based on statistical analysis of the scanned print. Both methods of analysis of the control prints showed that the control prints made from chromium-treated specimens were purer than the prints made from the non-chromium-treated specimens. Considering that all the conditions of making the printing forms and the printing conditions, except the electro less deposition procedure were the same, it could be concluded that the electro less deposited layer of chromium improved the printing properties of the offset printing form because of the increased wettability...|$|E

The gauge consists of a field unit anchored at the location where the ocean wave height is to be measured, and a base unit stationed in land [...] The base unit can be connected to a computer to download wave height data for analysis. The field unit (see Fig.) consists of (1) an air-filled torus-shaped fully submerged platform anchored to sea bed, (2) a level sensing column hinged to the platform, and (3) a control box with electronic circuits, a radio transmitter, and rechargeable batteries.

40|$|A {{discussion}} {{regarding the}} alignment and measuring procedure of propeller shafts has arose {{due to the}} competing situation in the industry, and higher standards from the customers. An estimation of the deflection of shafts in different alignment situations has been made with help of FEM-analysis and beam theory. This has been analyzed and compared with the experience from Rolls-Royce AB suppliers of shafts. An evaluation of measuring protocols has been made and the result indicates {{that there is a}} correlation between the deflection of the shaft and the run out. Results from a measuring test performed by Balino, Spain, verifies this conclusion. But the main issue is considered to be the type of supports that prevent the shaft from moving in the horizontal plane. The solution to this issue is to use supports along the shaft that only prevents the deflection in the median plane.   A recommendation to the Rolls-Royce AB is to perform changes in their measuring protocols to make them easier to use and to include more information. The sequence of the measuring points in the protocol should be re-arranged and re-named. Information of what type of support that has been used by the supplier and where they been placed should be added to the protocols to increase the traceability when questions arise. To make the measuring protocol unequivocal, the position of the <b>measuring</b> <b>gauge</b> should be marked in the protocol and the point of reference marked on the shaft.   External expertise will participate in a workshop to educate and discuss with Rolls-Royce AB personnel how to change required references in the drawing of the shaft arrangements...|$|E

Materials and Methods: Sixty sex-matched cases with an age range of 15 - 20 year old were selected and evenly divided into 2 groups as follows: 30 patients were treated by extraction of 4 premolars and 30 received a non-extraction treatment. All patients had class 1 malocclusion before treatment and were well treated with the standard edgewisesystem in a private clinic. With the aid of an ABO <b>measuring</b> <b>gauge,</b> 8 parameters of occlusion were measured 3 times,each. Reproducibility of the measurements were evaluated by use of the Phi correlation coefficient and the total OGS scores between thetwo groups were compared using Levene`s test and Student t- test with the significant level at 95 %. Results: The mean OSG scores were significantly more negative in the non–extraction group (- 6. 58 ± 8. 63) as compared to the extraction group (- 28. 65 ± 6. 67, p < 0. 004).

Purpose: The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the effects of polymerization time and sectioning on the dimensional changes of auto-polymerizing acrylic resin used in splinting impression copings and the resulting fit of the prosthesis. Materials and Methods: Open-tray impression copings were connected to a master cast containing 5 external-hex implants. Auto-polymerizing acrylic resin was allowed to polymerize in a heavy-body polyvinyl siloxane matrix according to 3 different time groups (8 minutes (8 MN), 1 hour (1 HR), and 24 hours (24 HR)), with 20 sets of splinted impression copings per time group. Each time group was further divided into non- sectioned (NS) and sectioned (S) groups (10 samples per group). A total of 60 gypsum bases were fabricated from implant analogs connected to the impression copings. A milled titanium bar fabricated from the master cast was used to verify the fit of the bar to the implant analogs. The casts were viewed using loupes (2. 5 x magnification) and a microscope (12. 8 x magnification) to visually detect any gap. The gap sizes were evaluated with a <b>measuring</b> <b>gauge</b> with pre-determined thickness in microns (μm). Results: Of the 30 casts tested in the sectioned groups (8 MN-S, 1 HR-S, and 24 HR-S), all of the casts displayed clinical fit when evaluated with magnification loupes and a dental explorer. From this evaluation, only the 8 MN-S group showed statistical significant difference (p < 0. 05) when compared to its non-sectioned counterpart (8 MN- NS). When evaluated with a microscope, no significant differences were found between the different time groups or sectioned samples. The microscope was able to detect gaps that were not detectable with magnification loupes and a dental explorer. Conclusion: Overall, difference in polymerization time and sectioning did not have an effect on the accuracy of fit. Sectioning for the 8 -minute time group did show an improvement in the fit when compared to the non-sectioned samples. Although clinical fit appeared to be present, it did not always indicate the presence of absolute fit...|$|E
