2500|$|Malting is {{the process}} of {{converting}} barley or other cereal grains into malt, for use in brewing, distilling, or in foods and takes place in a maltings, sometimes called a malthouse, or a <b>malting</b> <b>floor.</b> The cereal is spread out on the <b>malting</b> <b>floor</b> in a layer of 8 to 12cm (3 to 5 inch) depth. The malting process starts with drying the grains to a moisture content below 14%, and then storing for around six weeks to overcome seed dormancy. When ready, the grain is immersed or steeped in water two or three times over two or three days to allow the grain to absorb moisture and to start to sprout. When the grain has a moisture content of around 46%, it is transferred to the malting or germination floor, where it is constantly turned over for around five days while it is air-dried [...] The grain at this point is called [...] "green malt". The green malt is then dried and pre-toasted in an oven (or kiln) to the desired colour and specification. Malts range in colour from very pale through crystal and amber to chocolate or black malts.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, {{pneumatic}} malting was introduced, in which the barley is aerated and the temperature carefully controlled, accelerating the germination. Large <b>malting</b> <b>floors</b> were no longer necessary, but power consumption was high, so <b>floor</b> <b>malting</b> held on well into the twentieth century. Only a handful of traditional <b>malting</b> <b>floors</b> are still in use.|$|R

5000|$|Burukutu {{production}} involves five basic stages, which includes: steeping, malting, mashing, fermentation and maturation. The production {{begins by}} malting, which involves {{the conversion of}} the Guinea corn or millet grains into malt and this takes place on a <b>malting</b> <b>floor.</b> This process is followed by steeping, which involves the soaking of the grains in water for at least three days to allow the grain to absorb moisture and to begin to sprout. [...] When the grain has absorbed enough moisture, it is transferred to the <b>malting</b> <b>floor,</b> where it is constantly turned over for around five days while it is air-dried. This procedure is followed by mashing in which the milled grain known as the [...] "grain bill" [...] (malted grain) is mixed with water known as [...] "liquor" [...] and heating the mixture. This process allows the enzymes in the grain bill to decompose the starch in the grain into sugars (maltose) to form a wort. The product is allowed to ferment using the sugar fungi form of yeast and allow maturation for 2 days or 48 hours.|$|E

50|$|The {{distillery}} {{was sold}} to John Dewar & Sons in 1922. Under Dewars it was rebuilt in 1955, replacing the <b>malting</b> <b>floors</b> with a Saladin box, and ending the farming activities on the site. The distillery was expanded in 1966, adding three stills to the three present stills, which were all converted to internal heating in 1970. In 1974 Benrinnes changed its distillation process to a partial triple distillation process. The distillery stopped producing its own malt in 1984 opting to buy malt on the market instead, and removed its saladin box.|$|R

50|$|Glen Scotia was {{formally}} known as 'Scotia' {{when it was}} first founded in 1837 by Stewart & Galbraith and Company. Stewart & Galbraith Co. ran the Distillery for almost 60 years. Notable industrialist Duncan MacCallum purchased the distillery in 1891 and he constructed the large frontage (<b>Malting</b> <b>Floors)</b> which run along High Street. In 2014, the distillery was bought by Loch Lomond Group who have invested heavily in the site with the majority of the engineering work planned out and managed by the distillery manager, Iain Mc Alister.Glen Scotia currently operates with a staff of just seven employees. It is believed there is one manager, one shop manager, and five distillery operators. Glen Scotia is one of the smallest in Scotland. The current annual production levels stand at around 500,000 liters and following significant investment is expected to rise above that.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} useful sources of {{information}} {{for the history of}} the Guildhall are the ink-wash drawings of Samuel Hieronymous Grimm a Swiss artist who was extensively employed by the Dean of Lincoln, Sir Richard Kaye mainly to record architectural subjects. Many of these drawings are in the British Library but there are some of his drawings in the Usher Gallery. There are four drawings of the St Mary Guildhall, done about 1784. These include a view looking up the High Street with the Saxon Church of St Peter at Gowts in the foreground on the right and the St Mary’s Guildhall to the left. The stone house closest to the church with the chimney, together with the bay with the porch next to the Guildhall were demolished in 1896 to make way for Sibthorp Street. There is another view in the Usher Gallery which is looking at the Guildhall from the opposite direction and provides more information about the houses to the south which were demolished. Although these demolished houses contain Romanesque windows it is likely that they were rebuilt in the 17th century making use of earlier building material. Grimm also provides a detailed drawing of the main entrance showing the orders of the arch studded with flowers and dogtooth ornament and two heads on the door jamb, one of which is a bishop. Above this is a running frieze with two heads above. The survey work on the west front has shown that originally the Guildhall had a first floor hall that was lit with five Romanesque windows, similar to those on the St Andrews Hall on the opposite sied of the street. The frontage also had two tall chimney stacks. Grimm also drew the Norman House which stands {{on the north side of}} the courtyard behind the Guildhall. Although this building has two romanesque windows and a massive pilaster on the front, it is in all probability an early 17th rebuild from the time that the Christ’s Hospital Bluecoat School occupied the premises. The Romanesque windows appear to be very similar to those on the buildings that were demolished in 1896, and possibly would have come from the source. The Norman House and adjacent building were used in the later 18th and 19th century as a <b>malting</b> <b>floor</b> and barley store.|$|E
40|$|Malt (dried, sprouted cereal grain) is {{the major}} {{ingredient}} in most beers and in certain hot and cold beverages. It is also a useful ingredient in some cereal food products such as bread and infant porridges. In terms of nutrients, malt contains mainly complex carbohydrates (starch and dietary fiber), but also protein of reasonable quality and availability, B vitamins and minerals. Malt {{is a source of}} hydrolytic enzymes, especially amylases. In brewing, the malt amylases produce the sugars which the yeast ferments to alcohol and carbon dioxide The amylases also increase the sweetness and improve the texture of food products such as bread and porridges. <b>Floor</b> <b>malting</b> of sorghum and millet is a traditional craft that has been carried out throughout Africa for hundreds of years.

5000|$|In 1826, James C. Allman {{established}} a distillery {{in a converted}} 18th Century mill, following {{the failure of the}} family's cotton manufacturing business. A report at the time, showed that production between October 1826 and October 1827 totalled some 63,023 gallons. Thereafter, the distillery grew in capacity over time, reaching a capacity of 200,000 per annum by 1836, and by the mid-1800s the distillery had become the largest rural distillery in Ireland, with a capacity in excess of 500,000 gallons per annum. When Alfred Barnard, a British historian visited the distillery in the late 1800s, it had become a significant enterprise. Boasting its own private railway line, and with the largest <b>malting</b> <b>floors</b> in the United Kingdom aside from those at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin, which were marginally larger, Allmans and was said to be [...] "the most dominant landmark in rural Co. Cork". According to Barnard, Allman's whiskey was of [...] "superior quality", and although it enjoyed a large trade in Ireland, was chiefly exported to [...] "England, Scotland and the Colonies". [...] In 1878, a fire broke out in the mill room of the distillery, destroying the mill, malthouse and 400 barrels of grain. The nearby bonded warehouses were saved by cutting down a timber bridge which connected them to the burning building. The damage, estimated to have amounted to £6,000, was covered by insurance. The fire cost the life of one employee, a man who fell from a height of 12 ft while trying to extinguish the flames.|$|R
