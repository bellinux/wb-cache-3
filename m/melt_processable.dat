50|$|Chain extenders (f = 2) {{and cross}} linkers (f ≥ 3) are low {{molecular}} weight hydroxyl and amine terminated compounds that {{play an important role}} in the polymer morphology of polyurethane fibers, elastomers, adhesives, and certain integral skin and microcellular foams. The elastomeric properties of these materials are derived from the phase separation of the hard and soft copolymer segments of the polymer, such that the urethane hard segment domains serve as cross-links between the amorphous polyether (or polyester) soft segment domains. This phase separation occurs because the mainly nonpolar, low melting soft segments are incompatible with the polar, high melting hard segments. The soft segments, which are formed from high molecular weight polyols, are mobile and are normally present in coiled formation, while the hard segments, which are formed from the isocyanate and chain extenders, are stiff and immobile. Because the hard segments are covalently coupled to the soft segments, they inhibit plastic flow of the polymer chains, thus creating elastomeric resiliency. Upon mechanical deformation, a portion of the soft segments are stressed by uncoiling, and the hard segments become aligned in the stress direction. This reorientation of the hard segments and consequent powerful hydrogen bonding contributes to high tensile strength, elongation, and tear resistance values.The choice of chain extender also determines flexural, heat, and chemical resistance properties.

Numerous films of this polymer with different doping level are measured by Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The Fourier transmission spectrum, the permittivity and conductivity are then precisely obtained between 0. 1 and 4 THz. The behavior of the dielectric function does not follow Drude theory and the extracted data are well fitted and analysed by Jonscher‘s universal dielectric response. Furthermore, we will present experimental results of shielding effectiveness (SE) obtained at high frequency from several polyaniline films. Among conducting plastics polyaniline stands out due to its outstanding properties. It {{is one of the}} so-called doped polymers, in which conductivity results from a process of partial oxidation or reduction. Polyaniline compounds can be designed to achieve the required conductivity for a given application. The resultant blends can be as conductive as silicon and germanium or as insulating as glass.

Thus, a mixture of 2 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 3 -phenyl- 6 -fluoroquinoxaline and 3 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 2 -phenyl- 6 -fluoroquinoxaline (HPFQ) was used to prepare star-branched PQ oligomers end-capped with 4 -fluoro- 4 -phenylethynylbenzophenone (FPEB). 1, 1, 1 -Tris(4 -hydroxyphenyl) ethane (THPE) {{was used as the}} branching unit. The oligomer number-average molecular weights (M (bar) (sub n) S) as determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) were close to the calculated values of 2922, 4698, 6474, and 13, 578 g/mol, and their intrinsic viscosities ranged from 0. 16 to 0. 57 dl/g (m-cresol at 30 C). The oligomers, which were quite soluble in common organic solvents, had glass transition temperatures (T (sub g) S) that ranged from 181 to 233 C (DSC, DELTA T = 20 C/min). They also underwent an exothermic cure with maxima from 377 to 443 C. The T (sub g) S of the cured oligomers ranged from 259 to 284 C depending on the oligomer M (bar) (sub n) and the curing conditions. The oligomers had low melt viscosities, e. g. an oligomer (SPQ- 46) with an M (bar) (sub n) of 4816 g/mol (SEC) had a melt viscosity of 150 Pa s at 348 C.

40|$|Wholly {{aromatic}} thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers (TLCPs) are {{an important}} class of high-performance materials, which offer a combination of excellent thermal and mechanical properties. TLCPs can be processed from the nematic melt into high-modulus fibers, films and molded articles. However, despite their all-aromatic composition, main-chain TLCPs exhibit low glass transition temperatures (100 - 120 o C) and low moduli at elevated temperatures, which significantly limits their final use temperature. Recently we demonstrated an alternate route towards all-aromatic TLCPs. [1] We synthesized oligomers end-capped with reactive phenylethynyl functionalities. This approach allows us {{to take advantage of}} the low melt viscosity inherent to oligomeric species.

An almost linear correlation of Tg versus molecular distance between the crosslinks was observed. An {{attempt was made to}} correlate Tg with initial mechanical properties (flexural strength and interlaminar shear strength) of unidirectional graphite fiber composites prepared with these resins. However, the scatter in mechanical strength data prevented obtaining as clear a correlation as was observed for the structural modification/crosslink distance versus Tg. Instead, only a range of composite mechanical properties was obtained at the test temperatures studied (room temperature, 288 and 316 C). Perhaps more importantly, what did become apparent during the attempted correlation study was: (1) that PMR methodology could be used to prepare composites from resins that contain a wide variety of monomer modifications, and (2) that these composites almost invariably provided satisfactory initial mechanical properties as long as the resins selected were <b>melt</b> <b>processable...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} the composition and a solvent-free process for preparing novel imide oligomers and polymers specifically formulated with effective amounts of a dianhydride such as 2, 3, 3 ', 4 -biphenyltetra carboxylic dianydride (a-BPDA), at least one aromatic diamine' and an endcapped of 4 -phenylethynylphthalic anhydride (PEPA) or nadic anhydride to produce imide oligomers that possess a low-melt viscosity of 1 - 60 poise at 260 - 280 " C. When the imide oligomer melt is cured at about 371 C. in a press or autoclave under 100 - 500 psi, the melt resulted in a thermoset polyimide having a glass transition temperature (T(sub g)) equal to and above 310 C.

PHAs in their neat forms have found a wide range of applications as general-purpose commodity bioplastics and value-added medical materials for tissue engineering scaffolds and drug delivery carriers. PHAs composites provide another dimension for tuning the properties of PHAs. In this chapter, the properties of PHAs composites and the processing technologies are reviewed according to target application areas, giving an insight into key issues in composite manufacturing. For using as general-purpose commodity bioplastics, the commercially available PHA members, poly (3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and poly(3 -hydroxybutyric acid-co- 3 -hydroxyvaleric acid) (PHBV) are reinforced using cheap renewable fibres of vegetable origin to offset the production cost and enhance their mechanical properties. For using as biomedical materials, high purity of PHAs (PHB, PHBV, and poly[3 -hydroxybutyric- co- 3 -hydroxyhexanoate] [PHBHHx]) are reinforced using bioceramics such as hydroxyapatites and various bioactive glasses to enhance their bioactivities and mechanical properties. PHAs composites will open a new avenue towards large-scale application of PHAs.

40|$|Blending of thermotropic liquid {{crystalline}} polymers (TLCPs) {{with commercial}} thermoplastics {{has long been}} known to lead to viscosity reductions, as well as improved mechanical and barrier properties of the final blend product over the pure homopolymer. The improved processability brought about by the inclusion of TLCPs is beneficial in a number of ways: (i) the power requirements for extrusion are lowered; (ii) hier processing rates are possible; (iii) using TLCPs as reinforcers reduces wear and abrasion processing equipment in comparison with glass fiber reinforcers; and (iv) homopolymers normally processed at temperatures high enough to initiate degradation may be processed at lower, less harmful temperatures. Cogswell et al. were the first to state that for improved melt processing, the TLCP should be in an anisotropic state over the temperature range as the homopolymer is <b>melt</b> <b>processable.</b> However since most commercial TLCPs exhibit nematic phase at temperatures at 300 ℃ or above, due to their wholly aromatic nature, they are not applicable to enhance the processability of molten polyethylene. The present work seeks to demonstrate that: firstly, viscosity reductions in excess of 90 % can be brought about by the addition of a very small amount of TLCP. Secondly, the viscosity reduction can only be achieved when the TLCP is in the nematic phase. Flow induced phase transition into nematic phase is necessary when the TLCP is not in its nematic phase in the quiescent state; and, thirdly, wall slip is negligible for blends containing TLCPs...|$|E

Currently, this polymer has been successfully licensed by NASA, and has generated revenues, {{at the time of}} this reporting, in excess of $ 1. 4 million. The success of this particular polymer has been due to many factors and many lessons learned to the point that the invention, while important, is the least significant part in the commercialization of this material. Commercial LARC(TradeMark) -SI is a polyimide composed of two molar equivalents of dianhydrides: 4, 4 -oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA), and 3, 3, 4, 4 -biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride (BPDA) and 3, 4 -oxydianiline (3, 4 -ODA) as the diamine. The unique feature of this aromatic polyimide is that it remains soluble after solution imidization in high-boiling, polar aprotic solvents, even at solids contents of 50 -percent by weight. However, once isolated and heated above its T(sub g) of 240 C, it becomes insoluble and exhibits high-temperature thermoplastic melt-flow behavior. With these unique structure property characteristics, it was thought this would be an advantage to have an aromatic polyimide that is both solution and <b>melt</b> <b>processable</b> in the imide form. This could potentially lead to lower cost production as it was not as equipment- or labor-intensive as other high-performance polyimide materials that either precipitate or are intractable. This unique combination of properties allowed patents with broad claim coverage and potential commercialization. After the U. S. Patent applications were filed, a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract was awarded to Imtec, Inc. to develop and supply the polyimide to NASA and the general public.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve polymer thermal {{conductivity}} (TC), Ultem(TradeMark) 1000 was compounded with nano-fillers of carbon allotropes. Ultem(TradeMark) 1000 was selected since it is both solution and <b>melt</b> <b>processable.</b> As-received and modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), vapor grown carbon nanofibers (CNF) and expanded graphite (EG) were investigated. MWCNTs were modified by functionalizing the surface through oxidization with concentrated acids, mixing with an alkyl bromide, and addition of alkyl and phosphorus compounds after initial treatment with n-butyl lithium. Functionalization was performed to improve the TC compatibility between the resin and MWCNTs. It was postulated that this may provide an improved interface between the MWCNT and the polymer which would result in enhanced TC. The nano-fillers were mixed with Ultem(TradeMark) 1000 in the melt and in solution at concentrations ranging from 5 to 40 wt%. Ribbons were extruded from the blends to form samples where the nano-fillers were aligned to some degree in the extrusion direction. Samples were also fabricated by compression molding resulting in random orientation of the nano-fillers. Thermal properties of the samples were evaluated by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermal Gravimetric Analyzer (TGA). Tensile properties of aligned samples were determined at room temperature. The specimens were cut from the ribbons in the extrusion direction; hence the nano-fillers are somewhat aligned {{in the direction of}} stress. Typically it was observed that melt mixed samples exhibited superior mechanical properties compared to solution mixed samples. As expected, increased filler loading led to increased modulus and decreased elongation with respect to the neat polymer. The degree of dispersion and alignment of the nano-fillers was determined by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM). HRSEM of the ribbons revealed that the MWCNTs and CNFs were predominantly aligned in the flow direction. The TC of the samples was measured using a Nanoflash(TradeMark) instrument. Since the MWCNTs and CNF are anisotropic, the TC was expected to be different in the longitudinal (parallel to the nanotube and fiber axis) and transverse (perpendicular to the nanotube and fiber axis) directions. The extruded ribbons provided samples for transverse TC measurements. However, to determine the TC in the longitudinal direction, the ribbons needed to be stacked and molded under 1. 7 MPa and 270 C. Samples were then obtained by cutting the molded block with a diamond saw. The largest TC improvement was achieved for aligned samples when the measurement was performed in the direction of MWCNT and CNF alignment (i. e. longitudinal axis). Unaligned samples also showed a significant improvement in TC and may be potentially useful in applications when {{it is not possible to}} align the nano-filler.

40|$|The {{principle}} {{objective of}} this project was to optimise extraction of cellulose nanofibres from banana tree and rye grass feedstocks and to investigate the potential use of these products as high value-reinforcing agents in thermoplastic polymers, particularly in polyvinyl alcohol (PV A) and polyethylene (PE). To this end, {{in association with the}} Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBr) in Belfast, the following extraction techniques were investigated to obtain cellulose nanofibres from these natural fibre sources: (i) chemical modification, involving mercerisation, acid hydrolysis and chemical bleaching; (ii) mechanical treatment, using a high speed (Turrax) mixer and high pressure microfluidisation and (iii) chemical and mechanical (chemo-mechanical) processes, by combining TEMPO-oxidation and high pressure microfluidisation. The nanofibres produced were characterised using scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, particle size measurement (static image analysis and laser diffraction), chemical analysis (zeta potential analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction), and thermogravimetric analysis. It was especially evident that the chemo-mechanical procedure yielded higher aspect ratio nanofibrils, a greater yield and higher crystallinity, than nanofibrils made by solely chemical or mechanical treatments. The cellulose nanofibres obtained were subsequently incorporated into PVA by a solution casting technique. The effect of different treated nanofibres on the mechanical, structural and thermal properties of these composites was determined. It was notable that banana nanofibres made by TEMPO-oxidation and high pressure microfluidisation showed phenomenal reinforcing effects in the PVA. Furthermore, ryegrass nanofibre, derived from the high speed Turrax mixer, was, incorporated into PV A and PE by using more commercially acceptable melt processing procedures, involving surface treatment of the nanofibres using silane coupling agents, their pre-dispersion in a PVA carrier, twin-screw extrusion compounding and compression lamination methodologies. Varying degrees of success were seen, from poor dispersion using cryogenically milled nanofibres, yielding little effect on mechanical properties, to very significant enhancement with <b>melt</b> <b>processable</b> PVA, being of a similar order to solution cast nanofibre-reinforced PVA To assess the relative reinforcing efficiency of cellulose nanofibres, conventional PE composites were also made using macro-scale banana and sisal fibres. To aid compatibility and enhance interfacial bonding between fibre and matrix in this system, maleic anhydride modified polyethylene was applied with both nano- and macro- fibre variants. By way of example, there was a 100 % improvement in tensile modulus of conventional banana fibre-reinforced PE composite with a 30 wt% loading of micron-sized banana fibres, whereas a 300 % improvement was recorded in tensile modulus for cellulose nanofibre-reinforced PVA with only 5 wt% of cellulose nanofibres.
