40|$|Background: Diagnostic reviews {{often include}} the sensitivity/specificity results of {{individual}} studies. A problem occurs when {{these data are}} pooled because the correlation between sensitivity and specificity is generally strongly negative, causing overestimation of the pooled results. The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), defined as the odds of true positives vs. that of false positives, may avoid this problem. The aim {{of the study was}} to review the advantages and limitations of the DORs. Methods: A systematic review of 44 previously published diagnostic studies was used as an example. Results: DORs can be readily implemented in diagnostic research. Advantages include: (1) they adjust for the negative and <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlations</b> between sensitivities and specificities, (2) they take account of the heterogeneity between studies with respect to the different thresholds chosen by the investigators in the original studies, and (3) it is easy to extend the model with covariates representing between-study differences in design. Limitations include: 1) the outcome parameter is a summary estimate of both sensitivity and specificity, and 2) the magnitude of the studies included is not taken into account. Conclusions: Reported sensitivities and specificities of different studies assessing similar diagnostic tests are not only negatively correlated, but also negatively correlated in a curvilinear manner. It is appropriate to take this negative <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> into account in the data pooling of such meta-analyses. The DORs can be applied for that purpose.

5000|$|Mental {{toughness}} {{has been}} equated with better understood constructs from psychology such as resilience and hardiness. The term resilience is often incorrectly used interchangeably with mental toughness. However, psychologists define resilience {{as a positive}} adaptive process of coping with stress and adversity, {{as opposed to a}} collection of psychological attributes or personality traits. Hardiness has been suggested as a similar construct to mental toughness. Hardiness has typically been constructed as a personality trait, which is generally seen as stable throughout the lifetime. This differs from the conceptions of mental toughness offered by both Jones et al. and Gucciardi et al. These authors both conceive of mental toughness as unstable, arising in development, fluctuating over time, and varying for an individual performer between different sport and life scenarios. This definitional dilemma plagues {{the use of the term}} mental toughness and if mental toughness exists as a valid construct it may on occasion be maladaptive. Evidence to support this contention is derived from a study of overtraining behaviors and mental toughness by Tibbert (2013). She reported that [...] "the MT attributes of mental self-concept and task familiarity displayed moderate <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlations</b> with sport-specific recovery scales of the RESTQ-Sport. The <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlations</b> reflect decreasing recovery at the highest levels of MT. The results suggest that some attributes of MT may relate to increased ability to recover whereas other attributes are associated with lower recovery (p.2-3). Arguably mental toughness is more closely linked with goal fixedness rather than adaptability and a flexible mindset, attributes which are central to resilience.|$|R
40|$|Background: Degenerative {{joint disease}} (DJD) in the lumbar spine {{is a common}} {{condition}} {{that is associated with}} chronic low back pain. Excessive loading of lumbar joints is a risk factor for DJD. Changes in lumbar lordosis significantly redistribute the forces of weight-bearing on the facet joints and the intervertebral discs. However, the relationship between lumbar lordosis and DJD has not been characterized in men and women. Methods: We characterised the correlation between standing lumbar lordosis and DJD in standing radiographic images from 301 adult female and male chiropractic patients. DJD was rated using the Kellgren-Lawrence scale, and lordosis was measured using the Cobb angle. Linear and <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlations</b> were investigated while controlling for age and sex. Results: We found a highly significant <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> between lordosis and DJD of the lower lumbar spine in both sexes, but especially in women, irrespective of the effects of age. We found the effect size of lordosis on lower lumbar DJD to be between 17. 4 and 18. 1 % in women and 12. 9 % in older men. In addition, lordosis of 65 (95 % CI 55. 3 - 77. 7) and 68 (98 % CI 58. 7 - 73. 3) degrees were associated with minimal DJD in the lower lumbar spine of women and men respectively, and were therefore considered &# 039;optimal&# 039;. This optimal lordotic angle was 73 (95 % CI 58. 8 - 87. 2) degrees in older men. Conclusions: Both hypo- and hyper-lordosis correlate with DJD in the lumbar spine, particularly in women and in older men.

Reflectance was measured in parallel to moisture content and chlorophyll fluorescence in five species of Sphagnum exposed to progressive drought. Decreases in moisture availability caused {{a significant reduction in}} ?PSII for all samples tested. An objective was to ascertain whether Sphagnum ?PSII was better correlated with (i) spectral indices directly related to photosynthetic processes through association with xanthophyll cycle pigmentation (the photochemical reflectance index; PRI), or (ii) indices indirectly correlated with photosynthetic activity but able to detect changes in canopy morphology (the normalized difference vegetation index; NDVI), chlorophyll stability (the structure insensitive pigment index; SIPI), or canopy moisture content (the floating water band index; fWBI). Strongest correlations were found between ?PSII and indices which were indirectly related to ?PSII. Both the SIPI and the NDVI exhibited linear correlations although these relationships were sometimes sample-specific. The fWBI was the index least affected by sample-specific relationships and showed a strong <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> with ?PSII.

Structural brain networks were derived from measurements of regional gray matter volume and were constructed in age-specific groups from baseline and follow-up scans. The structural brain networks showed economical small-world properties, providing high global and local efficiency for parallel information processing at low connection costs. In the analysis of the global network properties, the local and global efficiency of the baseline scan were significantly lower compared to the follow-up scan. Moreover, the annual rate of changes in local and global efficiency showed a positive and negative quadratic correlation with the baseline age, respectively; both <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlations</b> peaked at approximately the age of 50. In the analysis of the regional nodal properties, significant negative correlations between the annual rate of changes in nodal strength and the baseline age were found in the brain regions primarily involved in the visual and motor/ control systems, whereas significant positive quadratic correlations were found in the brain regions predominately associated with the default-mode, attention, and memory systems. The results of the longitudinal study are consistent with the findings of our previous cross-sectional study: the structural brain networks develop into a fast distribution from young to middle age (approximately 50 years old) and eventually became a fast localization in the old age.

40|$|The {{perioperative}} {{management of}} dabigatran is challenging, and recommendations based on activated {{partial thromboplastin time}} (aPTT) and thrombin time (TT) are unsatisfactory. Dedicated coagulation tests have limitations at plasma concentrations < 50 ng/ml. Therefore, a more sensitive test, which is available 24 / 7, is required. It was the aim of this study to investigate the performance of the Hemoclot Thrombin Inhibitors® LOW (HTI LOW) kit, a diluted thrombin time, and the STA® – ECA II (ECA-II) kit, a chromogenic variant of the ecarin clotting time, that were developed to measure low dabigatran concentrations, compared to reference dabigatran analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This study included 33 plasma samples from patients treated with dabigatran etexilate who had plasma concentrations < 200 ng/ml. HTI LOW and ECA-II were performed along with HTI, aPTT (STA®-C. K. Prest® and SynthasIL ®) and TT (STA® – Thrombin). All procedures were performed according to recommendations by the manufacturers. Linear (or <b>curvilinear)</b> <b>correlations</b> and Bland-Altman analyses were calculated. For free dabigatran concentrations < 50 ng/ml, the R 2 of linear correlations were 0. 69, 0. 84 and 0. 61, with HTI, HTI LOW and ECA-II, respectively. The R 2 for TT, STA®-C. K. Prest® and SynthasIL® were 0. 67, 0. 42 and 0. 15. For HTI, HTI LOW and ECA-II, Bland-Altman analyses revealed mean differences of – 6 ng/ml (95 %CI: – 25 – 14 ng/ml), 1 ng/ml (95 %CI: – 18 – 19 ng/ml) and – 1 ng/ml (95 %CI: – 25 – 23 ng/ml), demonstrating that tests dedicated to measuring low concentrations are more accurate than HTI. In conclusion, the use of HTI LOW or ECA-II to assess low plasma dabigatran concentrations is supported by our findings. © 2015 Schattauer...|$|R
40|$|Previously, {{we found}} a {{significant}} association between photosystem II efficiency (I broken vertical bar PSII) and photochemical reflectance index (PRI) measured at predawn among different species at different elevations and throughout several seasons. However, this relationship has not been evaluated under varied levels of illumination. Here, we used the Taiwan species Pinus taiwanensis (a conifer distributed at 750 - 3, 000 m a. s. l.), Stranvaesia niitakayamensis (an evergreen tree, 1, 700 - 3, 100 m) and two Miscanthus spp. (perennial C- 4 Gramineae, coastline- 3, 200 m) to elucidate the I broken vertical bar PSII-PRI relationship. We studied six levels of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) (0, 200, 400, 800, 1, 200 and 2, 000 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1)) over several growth seasons at high (2, 600 m a. s. l.) and low (800 m a. s. l.) elevation sites. In comparing the same species or genus, I broken vertical bar PSII and PRI were closely correlated in darkness or under {{the same level of}} PPFD, with data obtained from different seasons and elevations pooled for regression analysis. Because both the intercept and slope of the I broken vertical bar PSII-PRI equation showed a negative <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> with PPFD, we could fit an empirical regression model, I broken vertical bar PSII = c + d center dot ln(PPFD) + e center dot[ln(PPFD) ](2) + f center dot PRI + g center dot PRI center dot ln(PPFD) + h center dot PRI center dot[ln(PPFD) ](2), for multiple regression analysis. Using this model, {{we found a}} close correlation between the estimated and measured I broken vertical bar PSII (r (2) = 0. 842 - 0. 937, P < 0. 001) for all four species examined and for mango (Mangifera indica) measured under both artificial illumination and sunlight (data from Weng et al. 2010). This empirical regression model could simulate both seasonal and diurnal variations of leaf-scale photosynthetic efficiency at high and low elevations...|$|R
40|$|Texture is an {{important}} quality parameter in fresh horticultural products. However, its complexity and variability entails that instrumental analyses describe it only partial whereas various properties are involved. For example, product water status, cell wall physical properties and tissue structure interdependently determine compressive and tensile strength, and elastic properties, which all together characterise texture. Furthermore, short-term effects on texture under unfavourable conditions during shelf five may be functionally different from those occurring during long-term storage. During recent years, new methods such as the acoustic impulse-response technique have become available to non-destructively analyse the elastic texture components. In addition, water potential, osmotic potential and turgor can be non-destructively assessed with the pressure bomb in combination with pressure volume analyses in many products. An experiment was designed to comprehensively {{study the effects of}} water status on different tissue elastic parameters. Water potential (Psi), fresh mass, apparent elastic modulus (E, quasi-static compression test), and stiffness factor (S, acoustic impulse-response test) were repeatedly determined on radish tubers during desiccation by free transpiration. E showed a two-phased linear relationship with Psi. At water potentials beyond the turgor-loss-region, the slope of this relationship largely declined. In turgescent tubers a considerable part of the variation of E could be explained by water potential. S showed a less clear two-phased relation and wilting seems to exhibit only minor effects on stiffness. Both E and S increased linearly with pressure potential but S showed a weaker correlation with turgor. While the decline in acoustic stiffness with increasing relative water deficit seemed to follow an exponential model, the correlation between E and RWD could be best described by a power function. E and S increased with increasing volumetric modulus of elasticity (epsilon) in a curvilinear manner. When E and S were compared directly, a <b>curvilinear</b> <b>correlation</b> was found. These results show that S is a good indicator for changes in produce water content. Both parameters are useful to indicate postharvest texture changes. However, the results point toward the possibility, that S is less related to short-term changes of product rigidity than E. status: publishe...|$|R

Section 1 discusses the Euler-Lagrange ODEs associated to single-time Stieltjes actions. Teir dual Hamilton ODEs are analized in Section 2. Section 3 studies the geometry associated to single-time Euler-Lagrange or Hamilton operators. Section 4 analyzes the Euler-Lagrange PDEs associated to multitime Stieltjes actions (<b>multiple</b> or <b>curvilinear</b> integrals). Section 5 formulates the multitime perimetric problem of non-renewable resources. Section 6 studies the Hamilton PDEs associated to multitime Stieltjes actions. Section 7 describes the geometry associated to multitime Euler-Lagrange or Hamilton operators (dynamical connection and semi-spray, Poincaré-Cartan form, Hamilton-Poisson systems on jet bundle).

40|$|Three-dimensional steady fluid flows {{are often}} numerically {{simulated}} over <b>multiple</b> overlapping <b>curvilinear</b> arrays of sample points. Such flows are often visualized using tangent curves or streamlines computed through the interpolated velocity field. A stream surface is {{the locus of}} {{an infinite number of}} streamlines rooted at all points along a short line segment or rake. Stream surfaces can depict the structure of a flow field more effectively than is possible with mere streamline curves, but careful placement of the rakes is needed to most effectively depict the important features of the flow. I have built visualization software which supports the interactive calculation and display of stream surfaces in flow fields represented on composite curvilinear grids. This software exploits several novel methods to improve the speed with which a particle may be advected through a vector field. This is combined with a new algorithm which constructs adaptively sampled polygonal models of stream surfaces. These new methods make stream surfaces a viable tool for interactive numerical flow visualization. Software based ori these methods has been used by scientists at th...|$|R
40|$|Current {{trends in}} {{surgical}} intervention favour a minimally invasive (MI) approach, in which complex procedures are performed through increasingly small incisions. Specifically, in neurosurgery, {{there is a}} need for minimally invasive keyhole access, which conflicts with the lack of maneuverability of conventional rigid instruments. In an attempt to address this fundamental shortcoming, this thesis describes the concept design, implementation and experimental validation of a novel flexible and steerable probe, named “STING” (Soft Tissue Intervention and Neurosurgical Guide), which is able to steer along curvilinear trajectories within a compliant medium. The underlying mechanism of motion of the flexible probe, based on the reciprocal movement of interlocked probe segments, is biologically inspired and was designed around the unique features of the ovipositor of certain parasitic wasps. Such insects are able to lay eggs by penetrating different kinds of “host” (e. g. wood, larva) with a very thin and flexible multi-part channel, thanks to a micro-toothed surface topography, coupled with a reciprocating “push and pull” motion of each segment. This thesis starts by exploring these foundations, where the “microtexturing” of the surface of a rigid probe prototype is shown to facilitate probe insertion into soft tissue (porcine brain), while gaining tissue purchase when the probe is tensioned outwards. Based on these findings, forward motion into soft tissue via a reciprocating mechanism is then demonstrated through a focused set of experimental trials in gelatine and agar gel. A flexible probe prototype (10 mm diameter), composed of four interconnected segments, is then presented and shown to be able to steer in a brain-like material along <b>multiple</b> <b>curvilinear</b> trajectories on a plane. The geometry and certain key features of the probe are optimised through finite element models, and a suitable actuation strategy is proposed, where the approach vector of the tip is found to be a function of the offset between interlocked segments. This concept of a “programmable bevel”, which enables the steering angle to be chosen with virtually infinite resolution, represents a world-first in percutaneous soft tissue surgery. The thesis concludes with a description of the integration and validation of a fully functional prototype within a larger neurosurgical robotic suite (EU FP 7 ROBOCAST), which is followed by a summary of the corresponding implications for future work.
