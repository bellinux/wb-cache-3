The longer the barn was, the more threshing floors could be provided. English barns went through an evolution {{in the number of}} threshing floors; the earliest had just one central floor, a design that became the commonest to be found in Britain.

5|$|There {{is a large}} statue by Eduardo Paolozzi named Piscator {{dedicated}} to German theatre director Erwin Piscator {{at the front of}} the courtyard, which as of 2016 is reported as deteriorating. Other pieces of public art, including low stone benches by Paul de Monchaux around the courtyard, were commissioned by Network Rail in 1990. The station has catering units and shops, a large ticket hall and an enclosed car park with over 200 spaces.

25|$|The ship {{borrowed}} {{many aspects}} of her design (as well as her name) from the Bloodhound, a Dundee-built whaling ship taken into Royal Navy service as HMS Discovery in 1874 for the British Arctic Expedition to the North Pole. By 1900 few yards in the United Kingdom had the capability to build wooden ships of the size needed - only two shipbuilders submitted bids for the contract - but it was deemed essential that the ship be made from wood, both for strength and ease of repair and to reduce the magnetic interference from a steel hull {{that would allow the}} most accurate navigation and surveying. The main compass was mounted perfectly amidships and there were to be no steel or iron fittings within 30feet (9.1 metres) of this point. For the same reason the boiler and engines were mounted towards the stern of the ship, a feature which also provided <b>maximum</b> <b>space</b> for equipment and provisions.|$|E

Assumption was made to derive the <b>maximum</b> <b>spacing</b> within which two successive humps influence each other. RESULTS: The statistically significant model explaining the relationship between spacing and 85 th percentile speed of vehicles was derived as well as the <b>maximum</b> <b>spacing</b> maintained in order to take the benefits of successive installation of humps.
