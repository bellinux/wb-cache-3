40|$|Hydroxyapatite (HAP) -coated {{implants}} on <b>metallic</b> <b>substrates</b> {{have been}} used as biomaterials. The problem is that HAP coating on <b>metallic</b> <b>substrates</b> is easily exfoliated at the boundary between HAP and <b>metallic</b> <b>substrates,</b> i. e. titanium (Ti). Therefore, Ti-HAP Functionally Graded Coating (FGC) is considered to improve adhesion of Ti-HAP coatings. In this paper, preparation of Ti-HAP FGC is studied in detail by using the well-controlled DC plasma jet.

We show that the optical contrast is largely enhanced using semitransparent <b>metallic</b> <b>substrates,</b> instead of opaque <b>metallic</b> <b>substrates,</b> which enable accurate characterization of ultrathin mica flakes.|$|R
40|$|It is {{expected}} that ring gap discharges will increasingly gain in importance as a pretreatment technique for <b>metallic</b> <b>substrates</b> prior to vacuum deposition. Such a process not only allows proper gas desorption, sputter cleaning and setting of the substrate temperature but also provides adequate surface activation. An arrangement for the pretreatment of moving strip-type <b>metallic</b> <b>substrates</b> by plasmatron discharges is described. The most important data, i. e. the power density, the time of exposure or strip advance and the substrate temperature, for pretreating steel and aluminium substrates {{in order to obtain}} adhesive films of nickel, aluminium and copper are given. The energy efficiency of the arrangement for the cleaning and heating of <b>metallic</b> <b>substrates</b> is compared with that of conventional systems.

50|$|Electron-beam {{freeform}} fabrication (EBF3) is an additive manufacturing process that builds near-net-shape parts requiring less raw material and finish machining than traditional manufacturing methods.

50|$|Organic {{coatings}} are {{a common}} way to protect a <b>metallic</b> <b>substrate</b> from corrosion. Up until ~1950 {{it was thought that}} coatings act as a physical barrier which disallows moisture and oxygen to contact the <b>metallic</b> <b>substrate</b> and form a corrosion cell. This cannot be the case because the permeability of paint films is very high. It has since been discovered that corrosion protection of steel depends greatly upon the adhesion of a noncorrosive coating when in the presence of water. With low adhesion, osmotic cells form underneath the coating with high enough pressures to form blisters, which expose more unprotected steel. Additional non-osmotic mechanisms have also been proposed. In either case, sufficient adhesion to resist displacement forces is required for corrosion protection.|$|E

It is also aimed to examine selective surfaces which are prospective candidates to be applied on glass tubes.

50|$|For {{optical disc}} {{recording}} {{technologies such as}} CDs or DVDs, a laser is used to burn microscopic holes into the dye layer of the medium. A weaker laser is used to read these signals.

5000|$|Many {{low-dimensional}} solids have anisotropic Fermi surfaces {{that have}} prominent nesting vectors. Well-known examples include layered materials like NbSe3, TaSe2 and K0.3MoO3 (a Chevrel phase) and quasi-1D organic conductors like TMTSF or TTF-TCNQ. [...] CDWs are also common {{at the surface}} of solids where they are more commonly called surface reconstructions or even dimerization. Surfaces so often support CDWs {{because they can be}} described by two-dimensional Fermi surfaces like those of layered materials. Chains of Au and In on semiconducting substrates have been shown to exhibit CDWs. More recently, monatomic chains of Co on a <b>metallic</b> <b>substrate</b> were experimentally shown to exhibit a CDW instability and was attributed to ferromagnetic correlations.|$|E
50|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a {{synthetic}} fluoropolymer used in various applications including non-stick coatings. Teflon is {{a brand of}} PTFE, often used as a generic term for PTFE. The <b>metallic</b> <b>substrate</b> is roughened to promote adhesion, and layers of PTFE, from one to seven, are sprayed or rolled on, with {{a larger number of}} layers and spraying being better. The number and thickness of the layers and quality of the material determine the quality of the non-stick coating. Better-quality coatings are more durable, and less likely to peel and flake, and keep their non-stick properties for longer. Any PTFE-based coating will rapidly lose its non-stick properties if overheated; all manufacturers recommend that temperatures be kept below, typically, 260 C.|$|E
40|$|Thin film {{polycrystalline}} silicon (pc-Si) on flexible <b>metallic</b> <b>substrates</b> is promising for low cost production of photovoltaic solar cells. One of the attractive methods to produce pc-Si solar cells consists in thickening a large-grained seed layer by epitaxy. In this work, the deposited seed layer {{is made by}} aluminium induced crystallization (AIC) of an amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin film on <b>metallic</b> <b>substrates</b> (Ni/Fe alloy) initially coated with a tantalum nitride (TaN) conductive diffusion barrier layer. Effect of the thermal budget on the AIC grown pc-Si seed layer was investigated in order to optimize the process (i. e. {{the quality of the}} pc-Si thin film). Structural and optical characterizations were carried out using optical microscopy, μ-Raman and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). At optimal thermal annealing conditions, the continuous AIC grown pc-Si thin film showed an average grain size around 15 μm. The grains were preferably (001) oriented which is favorable for its epitaxial thickening. This work proves the feasibility of the AIC method to grow large grains pc-Si seed layer on TaN coated metal substrates. These results are, in terms of grains size, the finest obtained by AIC on <b>metallic</b> <b>substrates...</b>|$|R

50|$|An {{effective}} TBC {{needs to}} meet certain requirements {{to perform well}} in aggressive thermo-mechanical environments. To deal with thermal expansion stresses during heating and cooling, adequate porosity is needed, as well as appropriate matching of thermal expansion coefficients with the metal surface that the TBC is coating. Phase stability is required to prevent significant volume changes (which occur during phase changes), which would cause the coating to crack or spall. In air-breathing engines, oxidation resistance is necessary, as well as decent mechanical properties for rotating/moving parts or parts in contact. Therefore, general requirements for an effective TBC can be summarize as needing: 1) a high melting. 2) no phase transformation between room temperature and operating temperature. 3) low thermal conductivity. 4) chemical inertness. 5) similar thermal expansion match with the <b>metallic</b> <b>substrate.</b> 6) good adherence to the substrate. 7) low sintering rate for a porous microstructure. These requirements severely {{limit the number of}} materials that can be used, with ceramic materials usually being able to satisfy the required properties.|$|E
5000|$|The {{operational}} concept of EBF3 {{is to build}} a near-net-shape metal part directly from a computer-aided design (CAD) file. Current computer-aided machining practices start with a CAD model and use a post-processor to write the machining instructions (G-code) defining the cutting tool paths needed to make the part. EBF3 uses a similar process, starting with a CAD model, numerically slicing it into layers, then using a post-processor to write the G-code defining the deposition path and process parameters for the EBF3 equipment. It uses a focused electron beam in a vacuum environment to create a molten pool on a <b>metallic</b> <b>substrate.</b> The beam is translated with respect {{to the surface of the}} substrate while metal wire is fed into the molten pool. The deposit solidifies immediately after the electron beam has passed, having sufficient structural strength to support itself. The sequence is repeated in a layer-additive manner to produce a near-net-shape part needing only finish machining. The EBF3 process is scalable for components from fractions of an inch to tens of feet in size, limited mainly by the size of the vacuum chamber and amount of wire feedstock available.|$|E
