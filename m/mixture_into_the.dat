25|$|Plants {{designed}} for lignite (brown coal) are increasingly used in locations {{as varied as}} Germany, Victoria, Australia and North Dakota. Lignite is a much younger form of coal than black coal. It has a lower energy density than black coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent heat output. Such coals may contain up to 70% water and ash, yielding lower furnace temperatures and requiring larger induced-draft fans. The firing systems also differ from black coal and typically draw hot gas from the furnace-exit level and mix it with the incoming coal in fan-type mills that inject the pulverized coal and hot gas <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> boiler.|$|E
25|$|The police {{issued an}} initial warning for the protesters to disperse, before using water cannons {{to fire a}} diluted tear gas <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> crowd. The tear gas mixture was {{allegedly}} diluted below the standard ratio owing {{to the presence of}} the elderly and the young at the protest. Nevertheless, protesters would deem the tear gas tactic an inhumane use of police force soon after the event. In a statement, the Korean Federation Medical Activist Groups for Health Rights (보건의료단체연합) criticized the used of tear gas liquid. The police were also publicly criticized for leaving behind tear gas {{at the site of the}} event, owing to the methylene chloride and CS gas that is harmful to humans.|$|E
25|$|Goodfellow was an {{innovative}} physician {{who was forced}} to experiment with differing methods than those utilized by physicians in more civilized eastern practices. He pioneered the idea of treating tuberculosis patients by exposing them to Arizona's dry climate. Goodfellow performed the first appendectomy in the Arizona Territory. During 1891 at St. Mary’s Hospital in Tucson, he performed what many {{consider to be the}} first perineal prostatectomy, an operation he developed to treat bladder problems by removing the enlarged prostate. He traveled extensively across the United States over the next decade, training other physicians to perform the procedure. Among these was Dr. Hugh Young, a well-known and respected urology professor at Johns Hopkins University. Goodfellow completed 78 operations and only two patients died, a remarkable level of success for the time period. He was among the first surgeons anywhere, let alone on the frontier of the United States, who used spinal anesthetic, which he improvised by crushing cocaine crystals in spinal fluid and reinjecting the <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> patient's spine.|$|E

25|$|In a closed-circuit rebreather {{the oxygen}} partial {{pressure}} in the rebreather is controlled, {{so it can be}} maintained at a safe continuous maximum, which reduces the inert gas (nitrogen and/or helium) partial {{pressure in the}} breathing loop. Minimising the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation. This requires continuous monitoring of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires real-time computer processing by the diver's decompression computer. Decompression can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in other scuba systems and, as a result, divers can stay down longer or require less time to decompress. A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a constant mass flow of a fixed breathing gas <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> breathing loop, or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume, so the partial pressure of oxygen {{at any time during the}} dive depends on the diver's oxygen consumption and/or breathing rate. Planning decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR, but decompression computers with a real time oxygen partial pressure input can optimise decompression for these systems.|$|E
2500|$|An {{incident}} from 1994, {{known as}} the AMIA bombing, was {{an attack on the}} Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (Argentine Israelite Mutual Association) building in Buenos Aires.

A suicide bomber drove a Renault Trafic van bomb loaded with about [...] of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and fuel oil explosive <b>mixture,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Jewish Community Center building located in a densely constructed commercial area of Buenos Aires. Prosecutors Alberto Nisman and Marcelo Martínez Burgos formally accused the government of Iran of directing the bombing, and the Hezbollah militia of carrying it out.

2500|$|The {{schematic}} of an HPLC instrument typically {{includes a}} degasser, sampler, pumps, and a detector. The sampler brings the sample <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mobile phase stream which carries {{it into the}} column. [...] The pumps deliver the desired flow and composition of the mobile phase through the column. [...] The detector generates a signal proportional {{to the amount of}} sample component emerging from the column, hence allowing for quantitative analysis of the sample components. [...] A digital microprocessor and user software control the HPLC instrument and provide data analysis. Some models of mechanical pumps in a HPLC instrument can mix multiple solvents together in ratios changing in time, generating a composition gradient in the mobile phase. [...] Various detectors are in common use, such as UV/Vis, photodiode array (PDA) or based on mass spectrometry. [...] Most HPLC instruments also have a column oven that allows for adjusting the temperature at which the separation is performed.|$|E

Then Thorne poured a little hot water over the plates, and as there was no vessel that would hold them, she overruled his objections when she volunteered to go down and wash them thoroughly in the creek. When she came back she found that he had made up a clear fire and spread out a blanket as a seat for her.|$|E
