50|$|<b>Language</b> <b>exchange</b> is {{a method}} of {{language}} learning based on mutual language practicing by learning partners who are speakers of different languages. This is usually done by two native speakers teaching each other their native <b>language.</b> <b>Language</b> <b>exchange</b> is different from other Language learning methods as there is usually no set syllabus or activities. <b>Language</b> <b>exchange</b> is sometimes called Tandem language learning.|$|R
50|$|Universities are {{increasingly}} experimenting with <b>language</b> <b>exchanges</b> {{as part of}} the language learning curriculum. In this respect, <b>language</b> <b>exchanges</b> have a similar role as study abroad programs and language immersion programs in creating an environment where the language student must use the foreign language for genuine communication outside of a classroom setting. Language Travelling has increased significantly over the last three years, with an increase of 67%. However, there are also concerns that <b>language</b> <b>exchanges</b> cannot be used as a substitute for formal language education, given the difficulty of using <b>language</b> <b>exchanges</b> in learning formal grammar and writing skills.|$|R
5000|$|In modern contexts, [...] "language exchange" [...] {{most often}} {{refers to the}} mutual {{teaching}} of partners' first <b>languages.</b> <b>Language</b> <b>exchanges</b> are generally considered helpful for developing language proficiency, especially in speaking fluency and listening comprehension. <b>Language</b> <b>exchanges</b> that take place through writing or text chats also improve reading comprehension and writing ability. The aim of <b>language</b> <b>exchange</b> is to develop and increase language knowledge and intercultural skills. This is usually done through social interaction with the native speaker. Given that <b>language</b> <b>exchanges</b> generally take place between native speakers of different languages, {{there is also the}} side benefit of improving cross-cultural communication.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn our study, {{which we}} {{carried out with}} a group of primary-school {{children}} aged between six and nine, we were interested in how <b>musical</b> <b>language</b> is shaped through group improvisations. Narrative dimensions of improvisation were studied through activities of Orff-Schulwerk, the specific music-movement education approach which, apart from music activities, puts great emphasis on development of social competences. The research was designed as a phenomenological case study. The findings show that, contrary to Orff-Schulwerk premises, children had yet to learn <b>musical</b> <b>language</b> and how to use it. It also turned out that teacher's expectations regarding the use of non-verbal communication are inversely proportional to the successful use of <b>musical</b> <b>language.</b> In line with Orff-Schulwerk's principles, rhythm proved to be the primary <b>musical</b> <b>language</b> parameter, as it was through rhythm that children first reached the sensations of others and reflectively depicted events from everyday life...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{distance}} language learning, speaking is frequently perceived as the most challenging skill; this paper reports on a 12 -week summer <b>language</b> <b>exchange</b> programme providing students with new ways of practising their oral abilities. Students who completed an undergraduate beginners’ language module took part in regular online, synchronous <b>language</b> <b>exchange</b> sessions with a partner. This paper analyses the impact of {{taking part in a}} <b>language</b> <b>exchange</b> task on the students’ motivation. The mixed methods research included an activity perception questionnaire (based on Deci, Eghrari, Patrick and Leone, 1994) to investigate the motivation of participants whilst undertaking a specific <b>language</b> <b>exchange</b> session, as well as qualitative data from both the questionnaire and the project discussion forum. The <b>language</b> <b>exchange</b> programme provides the opportunity for learners to take ownership of their learning and personalize it, and functions as a bridge between formal and informal learning. However, despite the enjoyment and interest provided by this type of experience, it is not without stress, and requires self-determination and autonomy to result in a positive and sustainable learning experience. ...|$|R

To support this idea a lot of examples of musical representations are demonstrated by the author. Music is viewed as a tone of ego-functioning involving the musical representations of bodily and visceral senses, cross-modal perception, unity of sense of self, individual fate of ego, and tripolar and bipolar musical coping codes. Finally, a special form of music therapy is shown to illustrate how can implicit <b>musical</b> <b>language</b> be transformed into explicit language by virtue of participants’ spontaneity, creativity, and playfulness...|$|R

40|$|Moving beyond Gunther Schuller’s Third Stream {{amalgamation}} {{of classical}} and jazz, this study explores whether the <b>musical</b> <b>language</b> of Olivier Messiaen {{can make a}} valid contribution to jazz piano performance. Initially, my project sought to answer such questions as: What elements of the <b>musical</b> <b>language</b> of Messiaen already exist in the jazz vocabulary? Am I able to extend this further? What are the timbral structures and pianistic effects within Messiaen’s <b>musical</b> <b>language?</b> What {{will be the most}} effective application of Messiaen’s <b>musical</b> <b>language</b> to jazz piano performance? Endeavouring to answer the final question led me to consider such aspects as whether the project should be limited to quoting Messiaen motifs, arranging Messiaen melodies, replacing jazz harmonic structures on standards with examples from Messiaen’s <b>musical</b> <b>language</b> or whether {{it would be better to}} approach the research conceptually. The work of Hubert Nuss provided encouraging reassurance that this was not an impossible task. In order to articulate this conception, the initial challenge was to decide how the classical and jazz worlds might meet in a ‘Messiaen’ technique. The approach adopted was similar to that used for undergraduate jazz study, namely, immersion in the piano scores and recordings of Messiaen’s music as well as by live performances. This was followed by the development and assessment of a contrived approach when specific techniques, such as tonal colourings or harmonic structures, were developed through prepared exercises and consciously included in my performance. It was then compared with an intuitive approach when no such precise parameters were established. This submission consists of CD recordings of two public recitals and an exegesis. It documents the development of this Messiaen technique and discusses its application in my performances. It also demonstrates the ways that Messiaen’s <b>musical</b> <b>language</b> can be used within jazz piano performance to provide a colour that distinguishes jazz piano performance in a competitive field.
