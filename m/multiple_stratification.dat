40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} social status and culture as formulated in Peterson's omnivore–univore thesis. The thesis has often been subjected to empirical investigations using preference or 'likes' data. Analysis of a unique data set (US-General Social Survey 1993) which provides 'likes' as well as 'dislikes' information has shown that certain omnivores draw symbolic boundaries to exclude low-status cultures, i. e. those preferred by low-status people. I re-analysed the data using the MIMIC model which simultaneously derives patterns of cultural tastes and estimates the effects of <b>multiple</b> <b>stratification</b> factors. This uncovers results which contradict previous findings. The results show that high-status people dislike many high-status as well as low-status cultures. The earlier contradicted findings arise from sample selection bias and neglect of patterns in cultural tastes, and simultaneously, <b>multiple</b> <b>stratification</b> axes underlying cultural tastes. Americans' cultural tastes are clearly patterned as well as strongly and orthogonally structured by multiple axes of stratification in addition to education which has often been a dominant focus. A disengagement of omnivorousness from inclusiveness is also proposed {{to deal with the}} manifest exclusiveness displayed by the cultural omnivores.

Its full potential benefit can be gained by the effective use of auxiliary variables in stratification related to survey variables. This paper focuses {{on the problem of}} stratum formation when <b>multiple</b> <b>stratification</b> variables are available. We first review a variance reduction strategy in the case of univariate stratification. We then discuss its use for multivariate situations in convenient and efficient ways using three methods: compro-mised measures of size, principal components analysis and a K-means clustering algorithm.

40|$|Data for the 1961 {{universe}} of nonfederal, short-term general medical {{hospitals in the}} United States are used to illustrate application of estimation and variance formulas for controlled selection, the probability sampling technique developed by Goodman and Kish. Some advantages of this sampling technique are discussed, and a controlled selection model is described. Comparisons are made between the variances of <b>multiple</b> <b>stratification</b> and those of controlled selection; the variances of the latter are seen to have two components, a between pattern and a within pattern component, where a pattern may {{be regarded as a}} first stage sample specifying the number of units to be drawn from each control cell. Three strategies for approximating the sampling variance are investigated. Each is seen to overestimate the per hospital estimate of bed capacity, admissions, and inpatient days, but to underestimate slightly the variance of average length of stay.

40|$|AbstractThe factory raising {{seedlings}} is {{a large-scale}} concentrated raising seedlings method, {{which is often}} used to develop seedlings of rice, vegetable and flowers. The technology and application of factory raising seedlings were introduced in this paper. Three kinds of raising seedlings modes, which have been put in use in China, are small raising seedlings greenhouse, intelligent raising seedlings greenhouse and factory raising seedlings respectively. The disadvantages are that, they belong to tray raising seedlings mode which needs large fields and trays, and the labor intensity is too hard. In order to reduce the area and raise the level of raising seedlings mechanization, a kind of rice factory three-dimensional raising seedlings system was presented, which is consisted of greenhouse, seedlings frame, carpet seeder and so on. A new carpet raising seedlings was also put forward and can produce long seedlings carpet that is twice as wide as seedlings tray at least. And a carpet seeder designed can flat the nutritional tape into seedlings frame and put seeds and topsoil on the tape. Integrating with <b>multiple</b> <b>stratifications,</b> carpet raising seedlings and intelligent control technology, the factory three-dimensional carpet raising seedlings system provides technical support for the seedlings industrialization development in future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The EIA Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report {{collects}} State level {{prices and}} volumes of petroleum products by sales type from all refiners and {{a sample of}} resellers and retailers. In 1983 the survey was redesigned {{by a team of}} statisticians. The problem of designing a survey to obtain target coefficients of variation (CV) for multiple products and geographical locations was solved by using <b>multiple</b> <b>stratifications</b> linked by a Permanent Random Number (PRN). The PRNs were also used to rotate the sample. Two subsequent developments, the discovery of Pareto Sampling and the Chromy Allocation Algorithm, contributed to a later redesign of the EIA- 782 in the middle and late 1990 s. A number of issues associated with selection using PRNs, implicit stratification and the sample rotation process have been examined over the years. This paper describes the evolution of a multi-product establishment survey based on the use of Permanent Random Numbers as a sampling tool. Early Stages Permanent Random Numbers have been used in survey sampling in the United States since {{the first half of the}} Twentieth Century (eg.

Radiomics is foreseen as an essential prognostic tool for cancer risk assessment and the quantification of intratumoural heterogeneity. In this work, 1615 radiomic features (quantifying tumour image intensity, shape, texture) extracted from pre-treatment FDG-PET and CT images of 300 patients from four different cohorts were analyzed for the risk assessment of locoregional recurrences (LR) and distant metastases (DM) in head-and-neck cancer. Prediction models combining radiomic and clinical variables were constructed via random forests and imbalance-adjustment strategies using two of the four cohorts. Independent validation of the prediction and prognostic performance of the models was carried out on the other two cohorts (LR: AUC = 0. 69 and CI = 0. 67; DM: AUC = 0. 86 and CI = 0. 88). Furthermore, the results obtained via Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated the potential of radiomics for assessing the risk of specific tumour outcomes using <b>multiple</b> <b>stratification</b> groups. This could have important clinical impact, notably by allowing for a better personalization of chemo-radiation treatments for head-and-neck cancer patients from different risk groups.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} use of {{multiple}} directions of stratification as a variance reduction technique for Monte Carlo simulations of path-dependent options driven by Gaussian vectors. The precision of the method depends on the choice of the directions of stratification and the allocation rule within each strata. Several choices have been proposed but, even if they provide variance reduction, their implementation is computationally intensive and not applicable to realistic payoffs, in particular not to Asian options with barrier. Moreover, all these previously published methods employ orthogonal directions for <b>multiple</b> <b>stratification.</b> In this work we investigate {{the use of}} algorithms producing convenient directions, generally non-orthogonal, combining a lower computational cost with a comparable variance reduction. In addition, we study the accuracy of optimal allocation in terms of variance reduction compared to the Latin Hypercube Sampling. We consider the directions obtained by the Linear Transformation and the Principal Component Analysis. We introduce a new procedure based on the Linear Approximation of the explained variance of the payoff using the law of total variance. In addition, we exhibit a novel algorithm that permits to correctly generate normal vectors stratified along non-orthogonal directions. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency of these algorithms in the computation of the price of different path-dependent options with and without barriers in the Black-Scholes and in the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross markets...|$|E
40|$|Forest fire {{policies}} are changing. Managers now face conflicting imperatives to re-establish pre-suppression fire regimes, while simultaneously preventing resource destruction. They must, therefore, understand the spatial patterns of fires. Geographers can facilitate this understanding by developing new techniques for mapping fire behavior. This dissertation develops such techniques for mapping recent fires and using these maps to calibrate models of potential fire hazards. In so doing, it features techniques that strive {{to address the}} inherent complexity of modeling the combinations of variables found in most ecological systems. Image processing techniques were used to stratify the elements of terrain, slope, elevation, and aspect. These stratification images were used to assure sample placement considered the role of terrain in fire behavior. Examination of <b>multiple</b> <b>stratification</b> images indicated samples were placed representatively across a controlled range of scales. The incorporation of terrain data also improved preliminary fire hazard classification accuracy by 40 %, compared with remotely sensed data alone. A Kauth-Thomas transformation (KT) of pre-fire and post-fire Thematic Mapper (TM) remotely sensed data produced brightness, greenness, and wetness images. Image subtraction indicated fire induced change in brightness, greenness, and wetness. Field data guided a fuzzy classification of these change images. Because fuzzy classification can characterize a continuum of a phenomena where discrete classification may produce artificial borders, fuzzy classification was found to offer a range of fire severity information unavailable with discrete classification. These mapped fire patterns were used to calibrate a model of fire hazards for the entire mountain range. Pre-fire TM, and a digital elevation model produced a set of co-registered images. Training statistics were developed from 30 polygons associated with the previously mapped fire severity. Fuzzy classifications of potential burn patterns were produced from these images. Observed field data values were displayed over the hazard imagery to indicate {{the effectiveness of the}} model. Areas that burned without suppression during maximum fire severity are predicted best. Areas with widely spaced trees and grassy understory appear to be misrepresented, perhaps as a consequence of inaccuracies in the initial fire mapping...|$|E

The 45 WS tasked the Applied Meteorology Unit to conduct an objective statistics-based analysis of MesoNAM output compared to wind tower mesonet observations and then develop a an operational tool to display the results. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction began running the current version of the MesoNAM in mid-August 2006. The period of record for the dataset was 1 September 2006 - 31 January 2010. The AMU evaluated MesoNAM hourly forecasts from 0 to 84 hours based on model initialization times of 00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC. The MesoNAM forecast winds, temperature and dew point were compared to the observed values of these parameters from the sensors in the KSC/CCAFS wind tower network. The data sets were stratified by model initialization time, month and onshore/offshore flow for each wind tower. Statistics computed included bias (mean difference), standard deviation of the bias, root mean square error (RMSE) and a hypothesis test for bias = O. Twelve wind towers located in close proximity to key launch complexes were used for the statistical analysis with the sensors on the towers positioned at varying heights to include 6 ft, 30 ft, 54 ft, 60 ft, 90 ft, 162 ft, 204 ft and 230 ft depending on the launch vehicle and associated weather launch commit criteria being evaluated. These twelve wind towers support activities for the Space Shuttle (launch and landing), Delta IV, Atlas V and Falcon 9 launch vehicles. For all twelve towers, the results indicate a diurnal signal in the bias of temperature (T) and weaker but discernable diurnal signal in the bias of dewpoint temperature (T(sub d)) in the MesoNAM forecasts. Also, the standard deviation of the bias and RMSE of T, T(sub d), wind speed and wind direction indicated the model error increased with the forecast period all four parameters. The hypothesis testing uses statistics to determine the probability that a given hypothesis is true. The goal of using the hypothesis test was to determine if the model bias of any of the parameters assessed throughout the model forecast period was statistically zero. For th is dataset, if this test produced a value >= - 1. 96 or <= 1. 96 for a data point, then the bias at that point was effectively zero and the model forecast for that point was considered to have no error. A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed so the 45 WS would have an operational tool at their disposal that would be easy to navigate among the <b>multiple</b> <b>stratifications</b> of information to include tower locations, month, model initialization times, sensor heights and onshore/offshore flow.

Here, {{the potential of}} radiative transfer modeling to predict LAI and leaf and canopy chlorophyll contents in a heterogeneous Mediterranean grassland is investigated. The widely used PROSAIL model was inverted with canopy spectral reflectance measurements {{by means of a}} look-up table (LUT). Canopy spectral measurements were acquired in the field using a GER 3700 spectroradiometer, along with simultaneous in situ measurements of LAI and leaf chlorophyll content. We tested the impact of using <b>multiple</b> solutions, <b>stratification</b> (according to species richness), and spectral subsetting on parameter retrieval. To assess the performance of the model inversion, the normalized RMSE and R 2 between independent in situ measurements and estimated parameters were used. Of the three investigated plant characteristics, canopy chlorophyll content was estimated with the highest accuracy (R 2 = 0. 70, NRMSE = 0. 18). Leaf chlorophyll content, on the other hand, could not be estimated with acceptable accuracy, while LAI was estimated with intermediate accuracy (R 2 = 0. 59, NRMSE = 0. 18). When only sample plots with up to two species were considered (n = 107), the estimation accuracy for all investigated variables (LAI, canopy chlorophyll content and leaf chlorophyll content) increased (NRMSE = 0. 14, 0. 16, 0. 19, respectively). This shows the limits of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model in the case of very heterogeneous conditions. We also found that a carefully selected spectral subset contains sufficient information for a successful model inversion.

40|$|This paper {{challenges}} recent {{views of}} the sociospatial transformations of inner-city neighbourhoods as ‘reurbanisation’, for, it is argued, such views tend to divorce the demographic dimensions of the processes at play from their contrasted social class meanings and implications. In addition, it argues that the ongoing demographic diversification of inner cities in the Western world do not stand for the obsolescence of gentrification as a key concept for understanding sociospatial transformations in these places, but rather that this trend alerts to a need to complement existing interpretations of gentrification with new insights into its demographic underpinnings. This point is illustrated via {{an exploration of the}} implications of contemporary changes in transition to adulthood for urban sociospatial structures and housing market dynamics in Brussels. Findings stress that the rapid rise of middle-class young adults in non-family households in Brussels’ inner neighbourhoods brings about the reinvestment of the existing private rental market, fuelling in turn a process of rental gentrification. Such process exacerbates the competition for residential space in the city, being strongly detrimental to low-income, working-class households. The paper concludes that notwithstanding all local specifics, everywhere at stake is the need to keep a clear sense of the <b>multiple</b> social class <b>stratifications</b> of demographic change in inner neighbourhoods. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Principal Findings Estimated HIV incidence among persons aged 13 years and older was 48, 600 (95 % CI: 42, 400 – 54, 700) in 2006, 56, 000 (95 % CI: 49, 100 – 62, 900) in 2007, 47, 800 (95 % CI: 41, 800 – 53, 800) in 2008 and 48, 100 (95 % CI: 42, 200 – 54, 000) in 2009. From 2006 to 2009 incidence did not change significantly overall or among specific race/ethnicity or risk groups. However, there was a 21 % (95 % CI: 1. 9 %– 39. 8 %; p = 0. 017) increase in incidence for people aged 13 – 29 years, driven by a 34 % (95 % CI: 8. 4 %– 60. 4 %) increase in young men who have sex with men (MSM). There was a 48 % increase among young black/African American MSM (12. 3 %– 83. 0 %; p< 0. 001). Among people aged 13 – 29, only MSM experienced significant increases in incidence, and among 13 – 29 year-old MSM, incidence increased significantly among young, black/African American MSM. In 2009, MSM accounted for 61 % of new infections, heterosexual contact 27 %, injection drug use (IDU) 9 %, and MSM/IDU 3 %. Conclusions/Significance Overall, HIV incidence in the United States was relatively stable 2006 – 2009; however, among young MSM, particularly black/African American MSM, incidence increased.

40|$|The {{essays in}} this {{dissertation}} explore {{issues related to}} health and retirement of older Americans, using longitudinal data on older Americans from ten waves of the Health and Retirement Study (1992 - 2010). The first essay explores the effect of both subjective and relatively more objective {{physical and mental health}} conditions on the probability of exit from full-time employment. Eight health indices (factors) are created {{from a wide range of}} health measures by principal component analysis. The effect of these health factors on the time until exit from full-time employment is empirically examined in a proportional hazard model. Single and competing risk specifications are estimated that allow for multiple spells of full-time employment and control for unobserved heterogeneity. The main results suggest that increase in functional limitation factor makes an individual more likely to exit via any route in general and the complete retirement route in particular. For mental health problems, increase in the depression factor increases the likelihood of exit from full-time employment via the complete retirement, part-time work and unemployment routes. While increase in cognitive disorders factor has no significant effect on the likelihood of exit via complete retirement, but increases the likelihood of exit via the disability route. These results have implications for public policies targeted towards retaining older workers within the labor market. The second essay examines the effect of retirement on post retirement physical and mental health and the extent to which the effects differ across these different health outcomes. The inherent issue of reverse causality between health and retirement that leads to endogeneity is addressed by using <b>multiple</b> sample <b>stratification</b> and instrumental variable estimation strategies. The stratified samples include individuals who are physically and mentally healthy prior to their retirement so that pure effect of retirement on post retirement health may be found. Five different instruments for complete retirement are also used to deal with endogeneity. The sample stratification results unanimously indicate that complete retirement has adverse effect on post retirement physical and mental health. While the instrumental variables approach results are mixed and are based on the choice of instrument for complete retirement...|$|R

However, {{only a few}} single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) {{have been reported to}} be consistently associated with aging. While investigating whether copy number variations (CNVs) could fill this gap, we focused on CNVs that have not been studied in previous SNP-based searches via tagging SNPs. Methods: TaqMan qPCR assays were developed to quantify 20 common CNVs in 222 senior American Caucasians in order to reveal possible association with longevity. The replication study was comprised of 1283 community-dwelling senior European Caucasians. Replicated CNVs were further investigated for association with healthy aging and aging-related diseases, while association with longevity was additionally tested in Caenorhabditis elegans. Results: In the discovery study of ≥ 80 vs. < 80 years old seniors, a homozygous intronic CNV deletion in the CNTNAP 4 gene was inversely associated with survival to the age of 80 (OR= 0. 51, 95 %CI 0. 29 - 0. 87, p= 0. 015 before correction for <b>multiple</b> testing). After <b>stratification</b> by sex, association remained significant in females (OR= 0. 41, 95 %CI 0. 21 - 0. 77, p= 0. 007), but not in males (OR= 0. 97, 95 %CI 0. 33 - 2. 79, p= 1). The finding was validated in a replication study (OR= 0. 66, 95 %CI 0. 48 - 0. 90, p= 0. 011 for females). CNTNAP 4 association with longevity was supported by a marked 25 % lifespan change in C. elegans after knocking down the ortholog gene. An invers...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{urbanization}} {{has destroyed}} natural areas and detach people from nature, with implications on quality of environment, quality of life, and {{physical and mental}} well-being. There is a rising expectation to preserve or create nature-in-city elements to restore healthy urban living. With grave shortage of easily developable land, urban develop-ment in Hong Kong has adopted an ultra-compact form with extensive obliteration of nature. The urban fabric has meagre provision of urban green spaces (UGS) and urban green infrastructure, calling for mitigation by more high-quality UGS. Instead of run-of-the-mill urban park design with manicured landscape, limited vegetation cover and ex-cessive hard paving, some UGS sites can nurture natural vegetation with a complex biomass structure and high leaf area index. The urban woodland offers an innovative option to insert nature into the tight urban matrix and maximize urban biodiversity and ecosystem services. A new development site in Hong Kong, embedded in a dense area, offered the chance to install a pioneering native urban woodland with ecodesign based on urban ecological concepts. It imitat-ed the key traits of the tropical native woodland, including vegetation cover, species diversity, tree density, closed can-opy, interlocking crowns, and vertical <b>stratification.</b> <b>Multiple</b> criteria were used to identify 44 native tree species supple-mented by native shrubs. Besides biomass structure and morphology, constituent ecosystem processes were fostered, such as energy flux, nutrient cycling and food-web formation, {{with a view to}} creating a closely-knitted, interdependent and self-sustaining ecological community. The native plants were accompanied by a prepared soil mix with native composition and properties to facilitate woodland establishment. Environmental benefits such as urban biodiversity enhancement, cooling, air cleansing, noise abatement and groundwater recharge would improve with progressive woodland ecosystem succession. The knowledge exchange project tested the scientific methods and furnished experi-ence for similar projects for healthy tropical cities...|$|R
40|$|Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition that presents with 3 main symptoms 2 ̆ 7 re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing, and hyper arousal 2 ̆ 7 after an individual experiences a traumatic event. Recent evidence suggests a potential genetic basis for PTSD and a sub symptom of hyper arousal, sleep, {{as a potential}} pathway for PTSD development, but no study has identified candidate genes associated with specific symptoms such as sleep difficulty. Based on a conceptual framework in which specific genes {{are associated with the}} onset of PTSD, this study used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) method with a case control study design to compare the genomes of individuals with and without PTSD. A secondary GWAS dataset from a study on alcohol dependence in European and African Americans was obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. PTSD cases and controls were analyzed using PLINK software. Signals from 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which have not been previously associated with PTSD, exceeded the established genome-wide threshold: SNP rs 13160949 on chromosome 5 (p = 7. 33 x 10 - 9, OR: 1. 565) and SNP rs 2283877 on chromosome 22 (p = 2. 55 x 10 - 8, OR: 1. 748). Neither SNP, though, maintained genomewide significance following corrected tests for <b>multiple</b> testing, population <b>stratification,</b> and false discovery, so the planned analysis for possible associations with PTSD by symptom category then by the sub symptom of sleep could not be completed. The {{results of this study suggest}} that PTSD may be the result of polygenic SNPs with weak effects, which supports a recent study indicating the disease may be highly polygenic. Positive social change implications include bringing attention to the clinical and research community that PTSD may involve complex polygenic factors in need of further study...|$|R
40|$|Conference Theme: Mechanisms That Cause DNA Damage and Related DiseasesNasopharyngeal {{carcinoma}} (NPC) has {{a distinctive}} racial and geographical distribution and is especially prevalent in Southern Chinese. Its genetic etiology and the mechanisms responsible for inherited genetic susceptibility {{are complex and}} unclear. We hypothesized that heritable risk for NPC is attributable to cumulative effects of multiple common low-risk variants, especially those of the DNA damage repair (DDR) genes. To score {{the harmful effects of}} multiple common variants together conferring subtle effects for cancer risk, a multigenic pathway-based approach was used to systematically examine associations between NPC genetic susceptibility with SNPs in genes in DNA repair pathways and other cancer-linked loci. This case - control association study covers 161 genes/loci with a focus on DDR pathway-based analyses in 2, 349 Hong Kong individuals. Three SNPs (rs 401681, rs 6774494, rs 3757318) corresponding to TERT/CLPTM 1 L, MDS 1 -EVI 1, and CCDC 170 conferred modest protective effects individually for NPC risk by the logistic regression analysis after <b>multiple</b> testing adjustment. <b>Stratification</b> of NPC according to familial status identified rs 2380165 in BLM association with family history-positive (FH+) NPC patients. FH+ NPC patients carrying higher numbers of unfavorable genotypes in different DDR pathways, including homologous recombination (HR), Fanconi Anemia (FA) -HR, FA-BLM, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), double-strand break repair (DSBR) - (HR+NHEJ), exhibited elevated NPC risk, while similar pathway-based analysis was not observed in sporadic NPC patients. The combined effects of TERT-CLPTM 1 L and DSB repairs for NPC risk were examined, since shortened telomeres are recognized as DSBs and DNA repair and recombination machineries are crucial for maintaining normal telomere function. Both FH+ and sporadic patients exhibited progressively significantly elevated NPC risk; a similar but less pronounced risk elevation was observed in sporadic NPC patients with regards to the cumulative effects in the DSBR pathways and TERT-CLPTM 1 L. The data suggested increasing NPC risk associated with TERT-CLPTM 1 L and DSBR signaling pathways correlate with NPC genetic susceptibility. This suggested a potential translational relevance for patient stratification and therapeutics...|$|R
40|$|Aging is a {{biological}} process strongly determined by genetics. However, {{only a few}} single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) {{have been reported to}} be consistently associated with aging. While investigating whether copy number variations (CNVs) could fill this gap, we focused on CNVs that have not been studied in previous SNP-based searches via tagging SNPs. TaqMan qPCR assays were developed to quantify 20 common CNVs in 222 senior American Caucasians in order to reveal possible association with longevity. The replication study was comprised of 1283 community-dwelling senior European Caucasians. Replicated CNVs were further investigated for association with healthy aging and aging-related diseases, while association with longevity was additionally tested in Caenorhabditis elegans. In the discovery study of ≥ 80 vs. < 80 years old seniors, a homozygous intronic CNV deletion in the CNTNAP 4 gene was inversely associated with survival to the age of 80 (OR= 0. 51, 95 %CI 0. 29 - 0. 87, p= 0. 015 before correction for <b>multiple</b> testing).

The finding was validated in a replication study (OR= 0. 66, 95 %CI 0. 48 - 0. 90, p= 0. 011 for females). CNTNAP 4 association with longevity was supported by a marked 25 % lifespan change in C. elegans after knocking down the ortholog gene. An inverse association of the CNV del/del variant with female healthy aging was observed (OR= 0. 39, 95 %CI 0. 19 - 0. 76, p= 0. 006). A corresponding positive association with aging-related diseases was revealed for cognitive impairment (OR= 2. 17, 95 %CI 1. 11 - 4. 22, p= 0. 024) and, in independent studies, for Alzheimer's (OR= 4. 07, 95 %CI 1. 17 - 14. 14, p= 0. 036) and Parkinson's (OR= 1. 59, 95 %CI 1. 03 - 2. 42, p= 0. 041) diseases. This is the first demonstration for association of the CNTNAP 4 gene and one of its intronic CNV polymorphisms with aging.

40|$|Im Rahmen der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden die Eigenschaften von atmosphärischen Aerosolpartikeln im tropischen Regenwald des Amazonasgebietes bestimmt. Dazu wurden die Daten einer fast einjährigen Lidarmesskampagne ausgewertet und diskutiert. Die Messungen wurden mit einem automatischen Mehrwellenlängen-Polarisations-Raman-Lidar im zentralen Amazonasbecken nahe Manaus, Brasilien, im Zeitraum von Januar bis November 2008 durchgeführt. Somit konnten erstmalig optische und mikrophysikalische Aerosoleigenschaften im Amazonasgebiet während der Regenzeit (ca. Dezember-Mai) und Trockenzeit (ca. Juni-November) höhenaufgelöst charakterisiert werden. Einleitend werden die meteorologischen Bedingungen im Amazonasgebiet erläutert und eine Literaturübersicht über Aerosolforschung in dieser Region gegeben. Das Messgerät sowie verschiedene Kalibrier- und Korrekturschemen, die zur Datenauswertung notwendig sind, werden vorgestellt. Auch Vergleiche mit anderen Messgeräten werden diskutiert. Diese zeigen, dass die aus den Lidarmessungen abgeleiteten Parameter von hoher Qualität sind. Anhand von Fallstudien werden mit Hilfe von Rückwärtstrajektorien und Satellitenmessungen typische Aerosolbedingungen am Messstandort diskutiert. Um die generellen Unterschiede zwischen Regen- und Trockenzeit zu quantifizieren, wird eine statistische Auswertung aller analysierten Lidarmessungen präsentiert. Die Analyse der Lidardaten zeigt, dass während der Regenzeit im Amazonasgebiet in ca. der Hälfte aller Fälle sehr saubere Bedingungen mit einer Aerosol Optischen Dicke (AOD) von weniger als 0. 05 (bei 532 nm) vorherrschen können. Allerdings wurde in ca. 30 % aller analysierten Fälle im Zeitraum von Januar bis Mai auch afrikanisches Aerosol, vornehmlich Saharastaub und Biomasseverbrennungsaerosol (BBA), am Messstandort detektiert. Dabei dominierte meist BBA die Aerosolpopulation, wie die Depolarisationsmessungen zeigten. In der Trockenzeit ist die Atmosphäre im Amazonasbecken hauptsächlich mit BBA aus Südamerika belastet. Daher ist die AOD im Durchschnitt um einen Faktor drei größ er als in der Regenzeit. BBA wurde zu dieser Jahreszeit regelmäßig bis zu einer Höhe von 4 - 6 km detektiert. Basierend auf den vorgestellten Langzeitmessungen werden erstmalig die optischen Eigenschaften von südamerikanischem BBA statistisch analysiert und diskutiert. Continuous lidar {{measurements}} were {{performed in the}} Amazon rain forest for almost one year in 2008. The results of the automated multiwavelength-Raman-polarization lidar observations were presented in this dissertation. These measurements are the first long-term observations of the vertical aerosol structure ever made in the Amazon Basin. The advanced lidar observations were conducted 60 km north of Manaus in the central northern part of Amazonia. The area is widely covered with pristine rain forest. A HYSPLIT backward-trajectory analysis showed that the observations were representative on a regional scale for the central {{northern part of the}} Amazon rain forest. The general weather conditions in this region are characterized by a wet (December-June) and a dry season (July-November). During the dry season, a high fire activity occurs in Amazonia, which heavily influences the atmospheric conditions. With the lidar instrument, vertical profiles of the particle backscatter coefficient at 355, 532, and 1064 nm, of the particle extinction coefficient at 355 and 532 nm, and of the particle linear depolarization ratio at 355 nm can be determined. The results from the long-term lidar observations performed in Brazil contain a lot of new information about the aerosol conditions in the central northern Amazon Basin and corroborate certain findings from former aerosol measurements in Amazonia. It was shown {{for the first time that}} advection of Saharan dust together with biomass burning aerosol (BBA) from Africa occurred regularly throughout the wet season. In about one third (32 %) of all lidar observations during the wet season, African aerosol was dominating the optical aerosol properties in Amazonia. The analysis of the vertical aerosol structure during such events revealed that the African aerosol arriving in the central northern Amazon Basin was usually trapped in the lowermost 3 - 3. 5 km of the troposphere. To quantify the amount of Saharan dust and African smoke transported towards the lidar site, the dust contribution to the measured optical aerosol properties was separated by means of the measured particle depolarization ratio. This study led to the result that in about one half of the cases with African aerosol advection, smoke particles contributed to more than 50 % to the total Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). The smoke transport from Africa towards Amazonia occurred predominantly between January and April when the fire activity in Central Africa was highest. BBA is thus a major constituent of the aerosol plumes that are regularly transported from Africa towards Amazonia. This is a key finding of the presented study. During clean conditions, an AOD (532 nm) of less than 0. 05 was observed and the aerosol was trapped in the lowermost 2 km of the troposphere. However, the analysis of the long-term data set revealed that these clean atmospheric conditions occurred in only 48 % of all wet-season cases. One example for such background conditions was intensively discussed and it was shown that a major meso-scale rain event occurred in the Amazon region at the same time. This precipitation event was possibly partly responsible for the very low aerosol load. Two case studies from the dry season were presented for which BBA dominated the optical properties. In the first case, a comparable high aerosol load (AOD of 0. 41) prevailed while in the second one, a medium aerosol load (AOD of 0. 15) was observed. Aged BBA advected from regions south of the lidar site were identified to be the dominant aerosol species for both cases. However, very different geometrical, optical and microphysical properties of BBA (e. g., vertical layering, lidar ratio, Ångström exponent, effective radius, SSA) were observed on both days. In the first case, aerosol was present up to about 4. 5 km. Extinction-related Ångström exponent s of about 1 and lidar ratios between 70 and 90 sr were found at different heights for the smoke aerosol. The BBA was highly absorbing (SSA of 0. 81) at heights of the highest RH (85 %), whereas above under dry conditions (RH= 50 %) only moderate absorption (SSA of 0. 93) was detected. In the second case, smoke was detected up to 4. 5 km, and Ångström exponent of about 2 and lidar ratios of 45 - 55 sr were measured in the aerosol layers. The BBA was only moderately absorbing indicated by SSA values between 0. 92 and 0. 94. The reason for the differences in the smoke properties could be the shorter travel time to the lidar site (< 24 h), different aging processes (e. g., cloud/rain processing), or different burning conditions. In both cases, no depolarizing effects of the BBA could be observed. The strong contrast between the aerosol conditions in the dry season and the wet season were confirmed by the statistical analysis of all lidar observations in 2008. Due to the high BBA concentration in the atmosphere, the mean AOD of the dry season was found to be a factor of 3 higher than the mean AOD of the wet season (0. 26 compared to 0. 08 at 532 nm). Maximum AOD values were less than 0. 55 (at 532 nm) and hence show that the lidar location was not in the direct vicinity of fire events. In only 7 % of all cases in the dry season 2008, an AOD below 0. 1 was observed. Also the maximum extinction and backscatter coefficient values in the dry season 2008 were 2 - 3 times higher than during the wet season of this year. The vertical aerosol distributions differ also significantly between the two seasons. In the wet season, the aerosol was mostly trapped in the lowermost 2. 5 km, while in the dry season aerosol typically reached up to 4. 5 km. Aerosol was occasionally detected up to 6. 14 km in the dry season. The majority of the aerosol (95 % of the AOD), however, was found to be on average below 2. 3 km in the wet season and below 3 km in the dry season. During the wet season, lofted aerosol layers and <b>multiple</b> aerosol <b>stratification</b> was less frequent than in the dry season. The extent of BBA plumes during the dry season showed no correlation to the ML top height. Virtually uniform smoke haze layers were observed up to the AL top. Thus, pyro-convection and/or cloud-related mixing seem to be the major processes for the vertical distribution of BBA...|$|R
