5000|$|U.S. Patent 2,405,991 Aug 20, 1946 Secrecy {{system for}} <b>multiplex</b> <b>telegraphy</b> ...|$|E
50|$|After the war Zemanek {{worked as}} an {{assistant}} at the university and earned his PhD in 1951 about timesharing methods in <b>multiplex</b> <b>telegraphy.</b> In 1952 he completed the URR1 (Universal Relais Rechner 1, i.e., Universal Relay Computer 1). He {{died at the age}} of 94 on 16 July 2014.|$|E
50|$|In {{the later}} {{years of his}} life he was engaged in {{developing}} a system of <b>multiplex</b> <b>telegraphy.</b> He authored A Plea for Pure Science, in 1883 an important document for the understanding of the relationship between science in university and in commercial contexts {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|At {{the rate}} of 45.45 (±0.5%) baud—considered speedy at the time—up to 25 telex {{channels}} could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using voice frequency <b>telegraphy</b> <b>multiplexing,</b> making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication.|$|R
50|$|The Telegraph Service {{encouraged}} Baudot to develop—on his own time—a {{system for}} time-multiplexing several telegraph messages using Hughes teleprinters. He realised that with most printing telegraphs {{of the period}} the line is idle {{for most of the}} time, apart from the brief intervals when a character is transmitted. Baudot devised one of the first applications of time-division <b>multiplexing</b> in <b>telegraphy.</b> Using synchronized clockwork-powered switches at the transmitting and receiving ends, he was able to transmit five messages simultaneously; the system was officially adopted by the French Post & Telegraph Administration five years later.|$|R
50|$|Colpitts and Otto B. Blackwell {{published}} an important paper on carrier <b>multiplex</b> telephony and <b>telegraphy</b> in the Transactions of the AIEE in 1921. They summarized work on bandpass filters and vacuum-tube electronics, which had enabled a four-channel commercial {{system to be}} placed in operation between Baltimore, MD, and Pittsburgh, PA, in 1918.|$|R
5000|$|The {{phonic wheel}} was used (in {{the form of}} Delany's <b>multiplex</b> <b>{{telegraph}}y)</b> on some telegraph lines on the East Coast of the U.S.A., and in the London Post Office. It {{was used as a}} chronometer, which was accurate to 0.00004 second in short time measurements. The most modern application was in the mechanical [...] "television" [...] of Paul Gottlieb Nipkow (1884).|$|E
50|$|Poul la Cour (13 April 1846 - 24 April 1908) was a Danish scientist, {{inventor}} and educationalist. Today la Cour {{is especially}} recognized for his early work on wind power, both experimental work on aerodynamics and practical implementation of wind power plants. He worked {{most of his}} life at Askov Folk High School where he developed the historic genetic method of teaching the sciences. Early in his life he was a telegraphic inventor working with <b>multiplex</b> <b>telegraphy.</b>|$|E
5000|$|He {{was born}} in King's County, Ireland (now Offaly). He came early to the United States and learned {{telegraphy}} at Hartford, Conn.; gradually he worked up from office boy to be superintendent of lines. Later {{he was also a}} newspaper correspondent, editor, and writer. His inventions include more than 150 patents, covering anti-induction cables, synchronous <b>multiplex</b> <b>telegraphy</b> by means of which six messages may be sent simultaneously over one wire, automatic ocean-cable systems, and rapid-machine telegraphy for land lines. His automatic telegraph system was capable of transmitting and recording 3000 words a minute over a single wire. He was awarded gold medals at the International Inventions Exhibition in London (1885), at the Pan-American Exposition (1901), and at the St. Louis Exposition (1904), the Elliott Cresson Medal twice, and the John Scott medal of the Franklin Institute. From 1893 to 1895 he was {{a vice president of the}} American Institute of Electrical Engineers.|$|E
50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and computer networks, multiplexing (sometimes contracted to muxing) {{is a method}} by which multiple analog or digital signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium. The aim is to share a scarce resource. For example, in telecommunications, several telephone calls may be carried using one wire. <b>Multiplexing</b> originated in <b>telegraphy</b> in the 1870s, and is now widely applied in communications. In telephony, George Owen Squier is credited {{with the development of}} telephone carrier multiplexing in 1910.|$|R
