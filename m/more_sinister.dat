5|$|Toads have a <b>more</b> <b>sinister</b> reputation. It was {{believed}} in European folklore {{that they were}} associated with witches as their familiar spirits and had magical powers. The toxic secretions from their skin was used in brewing evil potions, but was also put to use to create magical cures for human and livestock ailments. They {{were associated with the}} devil; in John Milton's Paradise Lost, Satan was depicted as a toad pouring poison into Eve's ear.|$|E

5|$|In America Widmerpool becomes {{something}} of a figurehead among youth protest movements; there are suggestions that his earlier problems may have resulted from a CIA plot. He returns to England in the late 1960s and is installed as Chancellor of a new university. During the ceremony he is pelted with red paint but immediately identifies with the demonstrators and becomes a central figure in the counter-culture movement. He resigns the chancellorship after a year, to run a commune for dissident youth. By late 1969, he has been drawn into a <b>more</b> <b>sinister</b> cult, led by the young mystic Scorpio Murtlock, which gradually overwhelms his life and independence. He is last heard of late in 1971, when during a ritual dawn run through the woods he collapses and dies.|$|E
5|$|Willis {{wakes up}} a few days later, but now has a <b>more</b> <b>sinister</b> personality. He finds Dupre's body and cuts off his fingers to {{retrieve}} a wedding ring before fleeing the hospital. Scully explains to Fox Mulder that Willis has been obsessed with the Dupre-Phillips case for the past year, and admits to dating Willis while he was her instructor at the FBI Academy. It is discovered that left-handed shears were used to cut off Dupre's fingers, {{despite the fact that}} Willis is right-handed, leading Mulder to believe that Willis' body is inhabited by Dupre's consciousness. The agents visit a University of Maryland medical professor who theorizes that during near-death experiences, an energy release can occur that could radically change someone's personality.|$|E
5|$|Amy Dudley (née Robsart) (7June 1532 – 8September 1560) was {{the first}} wife of Lord Robert Dudley, {{favourite}} of Elizabeth I of England. She is primarily known for her death by falling {{down a flight of}} stairs, the circumstances of which have often been regarded as suspicious. Amy Robsart was the only child of a substantial Norfolk gentleman and at nearly 18 married Robert Dudley, a son of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland. In 1553 Robert Dudley was condemned to death and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where Amy Dudley was allowed to visit him. After his release the couple lived in straitened financial circumstances until, with the accession of ElizabethI in late 1558, Dudley became Master of the Horse, an important court office. The Queen soon {{fell in love with him}} and there was talk that Amy Dudley, who did not follow her husband to court, was suffering from an illness, and that Elizabeth would perhaps marry her favourite should his wife die. The rumours grew <b>more</b> <b>sinister</b> when Elizabeth remained single against the common expectation that she would accept one of her many foreign suitors.|$|E

Continuing to espouse his straight-edge philosophy, Punk began to present himself as a cult-like savior to the crowd, growing the hair on his head, face and chest in an allusion to Jesus. Through January 2010, Punk began to convert planted {{members of the audience}} to a straight-edge lifestyle, making them take a pledge of allegiance to him and shaving their head as a sign of renewal and devotion. After converting many people who were not seen again, convert Serena began accompanying Punk and Gallows to form the Straight Edge Society. As well as leading this alliance, Punk was also the mentor of WWE NXT rookie Darren Young who flirted with the idea of becoming straight-edge before refusing just before his head was to be shaved.|$|E

In Soul Reaver, Raziel {{discovered}} that he was once a human and a leading member of the vampire-hunting Sarafan brotherhood, and his epiphanies drive {{the conflict in the}} story. Kain, the antagonist of Soul Reaver, appears as a non-player character in cutscenes, urging Raziel to unearth his destiny. Moebius the Time Streamer, a sorcerer who was a villain in Blood Omen, attempts to manipulate Raziel into destroying Kain—it is revealed that he is an agent of The Elder God, Raziel's ally and guide in Soul Reaver, who is slowly established as a <b>more</b> <b>sinister</b> entity. Ariel, a specter bound to the Pillars who featured in Blood Omen and Soul Reaver, returns, and the vampire Vorador, also from Blood Omen, assists Raziel early in the game. The ancient vampire Janos Audron, a new character who was previously only mentioned in Blood Omen, acts as Raziel's mentor {{towards the end of the}} story.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Luigi having won a mansion in a contest. Despite not having entered any contest, he {{promptly}} told Mario about the mansion, {{and the two}} agreed to meet up outside it that evening. Luigi takes a flashlight {{with him and he}} follows the map to the mansion. Upon finally arriving at his new mansion, which looks much <b>more</b> <b>sinister</b> than the supplied photo, Mario is nowhere to be found. Luigi proceeds inside the mansion, entering the Parlor after he gains the key from a strange ghost-like shape. Upon entry, he is soon assaulted by a Gold Ghost, only to be saved by a little old man wielding a vacuum cleaner. The old man, however, is unable to reel in the ghost and is soon overpowered. After being helped to his feet by Luigi, the old man introduces himself as Professor Elvin Gadd. The two retreat from the mansion when more of the Gold Ghosts appear.|$|E

50|$|In 1996, Ul de Rico {{painted a}} sequel to his {{original}} Goblins story entitled The White Goblin. The paintings were of a similar vein to his previous work, but many were nearly devoid of color and were {{a stark contrast to}} the effulgence of the originals. This was done deliberately, as the White Goblin had a <b>more</b> ecologically <b>sinister</b> plot than his brethren, one that involved habitat destruction and the subjugation of natural resources for his own selfish ends. This book seems appropriate for an age group somewhat older than that of the first. The moral lessons (as well as the story, illustrations and language) are more complex and profound than before.|$|R
50|$|In Nazi Germany, {{especially}} during World War II, psychiatrists {{and others in}} programmes such as Action T4 and Action 14f13 systematically deported, sterilised, interned and euthanised (killed) patients and prisoners who could be classed as mentally ill, feebleminded, psychopathic, criminally insane or just asocial. In {{the aftermath of the}} war, therefore, concepts of antisocial psychopathic personalities fell out of favour in Europe to some extent. At the same time, however, in America and other countries the concept became increasingly prominent, used to categorise allied soldiers as fit or unfit for duty or on return to society, or, conversely, in the <b>more</b> specific <b>sinister</b> sense of the term, as a way to explain the actions of Nazis.|$|R

Otherwise, though, he doesn't betray his <b>more</b> <b>sinister</b> intent towards Brendan. Later that night, he sends his son out to kidnap the sleeping Brendan from the house.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the India-Pakistan {{conflict}} took a <b>more</b> <b>sinister</b> turn when the United States received intelligence that Pakistani nuclear warheads were being moved towards the border. Bill Clinton tried to dissuade Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif from nuclear brinkmanship, even threatening Pakistan of dire consequences. According to a White House official, Sharif seemed to be genuinely surprised by this supposed missile movement and responded that India was probably planning the same. In a May 2000 article, Sanjay Badri-Maharaj claimed that India too had readied at least five nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles, but could not back up this claim with any official proof.|$|E

The Federation has undergone significant internal changes in its quest to explore and seek out new life, adding new degrees of complexity and controversy to its methods, especially those focused on the Prime Directive.

25|$|The {{environment}} in which the Inuit lived inspired a mythology filled with adventure tales of whale and walrus hunts. Long winter months of waiting for caribou herds or sitting near breathing holes hunting seals gave birth to stories of mysterious and sudden appearance of ghosts and fantastic creatures. Some Inuit looked into the aurora borealis, or northern lights, to find images of their family and friends dancing in the next life. However, some Inuit believed that the lights were <b>more</b> <b>sinister</b> and if you whistled at them, they would come down and cut off your head. This tale is still told to children today. For others they were invisible giants, the souls of animals, a guide to hunting and as a spirit for the angakkuq to help with healing. They relied upon the angakkuq (shaman) for spiritual interpretation. The nearest thing to a central deity was the Old Woman (Sedna), who lived beneath the sea. The waters, a central food source, were believed to contain great gods.|$|E
25|$|Boxing was {{a popular}} spectator sport in Ancient Rome. In order for the fighters to protect {{themselves}} against their opponents they wrapped leather thongs around their fists. Eventually harder leather was used and the thong soon became a weapon. The Romans even introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the cestus which then led to a <b>more</b> <b>sinister</b> weapon called the myrmex ('limb piercer'). Fighting events were held at Roman Amphitheatres. The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please the spectators who gathered at such events. However, especially in later times, purchased slaves and trained combat performers were valuable commodities, and their lives were not given up without due consideration. Often slaves were used against {{one another in a}} circle marked on the floor. This is where the term ring came from. In AD 393, during the Roman gladiator period, boxing was abolished due to excessive brutality. It was not until the late 16th century that boxing re-surfaced in London.|$|E
