5|$|Irish {{immigrants}} generally remained {{loyal to}} the Democratic Party, but McKinley's promises of sound money attracted German-Americans who were appalled by Bryan's inflationary proposals. German-Americans had long been Democratic; efforts by that party to rebut McKinley, including circulating a statement by Bismarck in support of bimetallism, were ineffective. <b>Many</b> <b>Catholics</b> and recent immigrants favored McKinley because of the dislike the American Protective Association had for him.|$|E
5|$|In November 1558, Henry VIII's elder daughter, Mary I of England, was {{succeeded by}} her only {{surviving}} sibling, Elizabeth I. Under the Third Succession Act, passed in 1543 by the Parliament of England, Elizabeth was recognised as her sister's heir, and Henry VIII's {{last will and testament}} had excluded the Stuarts from succeeding to the English throne. Yet, {{in the eyes}} of <b>many</b> <b>Catholics,</b> Elizabeth was illegitimate, and Mary Stuart, as the senior descendant of Henry VIII's elder sister, was the rightful queen of England. Henry II of France proclaimed his eldest son and daughter-in-law king and queen of England, and in France the royal arms of England were quartered with those of Francis and Mary. Mary's claim to the English throne was a perennial sticking point between her and Elizabeth I.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{numbers of}} Catholic {{refugees}} {{came from the}} two northern dioceses with {{the highest percentage of}} Catholics in Vietnam. These were Phát Diêm and Bùi Chu, mainly located in modern-day Ninh Bình and Nam Định Provinces respectively. The bishops of the dioceses, had been strident opponents of the communists, and both had organised Catholic paramilitary groups that fought against the Viet Minh, which had long identified Catholics with colonial collaborationism. When the communists had gained the upper hand in the north, <b>many</b> <b>Catholics</b> had already begun making preparations to move to the south, where the communists were less influential, and large movements began immediately when news of the partition came through. After the defeat of French Union forces at Dien Bien Phu, French officers had evacuated their troops from Bui Chu and Phat Diem to reinforce the area between Hanoi and Haiphong which they still controlled, making it very easy for the communists to progress through the Catholic strongholds.|$|E

25|$|Catholics gather {{as local}} {{communities}} called parishes, {{headed by a}} priest, and typically meet at a permanent church building for liturgies every Sunday, weekdays and on holy days. Within the 196 geographical dioceses and archdioceses (excluding the Archdiocese for the Military Services), there are 17,651 local Catholic parishes in the United States. The Catholic Church has the third highest total number of local congregations in the US behind Southern Baptists and United Methodists. However, the average Catholic parish is significantly larger than the average Baptist or Methodist congregation; {{there are more than}} four times as <b>many</b> <b>Catholics</b> as Southern Baptists and more than eight times as <b>many</b> <b>Catholics</b> as United Methodists.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>Catholics</b> and nationalists {{believed}} that the IRA {{had been unable to}} defend them during the August 1969 riots. However, it is argued that the IRA's defence of Short Strand redeemed it in the eyes of <b>many</b> <b>Catholics</b> and nationalists. Prior to the gun battle, the IRA had been waiting for an opportunity to portray themselves as defenders of the Catholic community, which was only made possible by the over-stretching of British Army forces dealing with rioting throughout Belfast and thus unable to provide protection to the Short Strand. Among republicans, the battle is seen as a key event in the growth of the Provisional IRA.|$|E

25|$|During the Irish War of Independence, {{the area}} was rocked by sectarian violence, partly {{prompted}} by the guerilla war raging between the Irish Republican Army and British forces, but also influenced by economic and social pressures.

25|$|The Civil Constitution of the Clergy, {{passed on}} 12 July 1790, turned the {{remaining}} clergy into {{employees of the}} state.
