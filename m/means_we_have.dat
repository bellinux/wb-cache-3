Spence D. of IGN wrote that the song has an [...] "R swoon", similar to Rihanna's previous singles. In an interview with Margeaux Watson for Entertainment Weekly, Rihanna explained {{the meaning of the}} song's lyrics: [...] "'Rehab' is a metaphorical song. Rehab really just <b>means</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to get over the guy. So we talk about checking ourselves into rehab, meaning we have to get over him. And we compare the guy to a disease or an addiction." [...] Watson further called the song a [...] "lovesick ballad".|$|E

Series creator Devin Clark said that they planned on giving it a summer theme since they knew it would air in the summer. Clark further elaborated on the decision to incorporate summer and Harry Potter themes into the episode, stating: [...] "We went, 'alright, those are two little nuggets of ideas we can incorporate into that.' We can't be as relevant to pop culture as some other shows, but it just <b>means</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{a little more of}} a challenge of making jokes that are a little more evergreen and poking fun of the genre in a much broader spectrum." [...] Screenwriter Powell explained that it is difficult for the series to do [...] "topical stuff" [...] as it takes up to nine months to complete an episode, but they were {{aware of the fact that}} the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 would premiere shortly after the episode was set to air. [...] "So it would seem like we were hyper-topical, even though we had a good nine months advance notice", he said. Powell said that they included famous wizards from many other sources, including The Lord of the Rings and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In an interview with Charles Webb of MTV, Clark elaborated: [...] "We make it a hodgepodge of the wizard references and obviously the main one is, and the most prominent one and the one that's most relevant to pop culture is the Harry Potter spoof that we've thrown in there.|$|E
