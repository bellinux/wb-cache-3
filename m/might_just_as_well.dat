25|$|The use of guns in Noten's work {{came about}} by chance. In the past Noten had felt {{uneasy about the}} large number of people in his {{neighbourhood}} that carried guns. Whenever he could he would ask people to give him their gun or he would buy it from them. He would then throw it away or keep it in store without any particular purpose for it. After a while he had quite a collection and he thought he <b>might</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> use these guns in his works of art. It also gave him the idea of a project he called Design Against Crime in which he collaborated with the authorities to persuade people to give up their guns in return for a work of art.|$|E
25|$|As {{time went}} by, Bradbury tended to dismiss {{censorship}} as a chief motivating factor for writing the story. Instead he usually {{claimed that the}} real messages of Fahrenheit 451 were {{about the dangers of}} an illiterate society infatuated with mass media and the threat of minority and special interest groups to books. In the late 1950s, Bradbury recounted:In writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451, I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who <b>might</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> not have been there. This was not fiction.|$|E
500|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} Chatwin grew unhappy at Sotheby's. There were various {{reasons for his}} disenchantment. Both women and men found Chatwin attractive, and Peter Wilson, then {{chairman}} of Sotheby's, used this appeal to the auction house's advantage when using Chatwin {{to try to persuade}} wealthy individuals to sell their art collections. Chatwin became increasingly uncomfortable with the situation. Later in life Chatwin also spoke of having become [...] "burnt out" [...] and said, [...] "In the end I felt I <b>might</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> be working for a rather superior funeral parlour.

500|$|Bryan's {{campaign}} had at most an estimated $500,000. With his eloquence and youthful energy his major {{assets in the}} race, Bryan decided on a whistle-stop political tour by train on an unprecedented scale. Hanna urged McKinley to match Bryan's tour {{with one of his}} own; the candidate declined {{on the grounds that the}} Democrat was a better stump speaker: [...] "I <b>might</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> set up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete with some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to think when I speak." [...] Instead of going to the people, McKinley would remain at home in Canton and allow the people to come to him; according to historian R.

500|$|When the {{platform}} debate {{began in the}} Chicago Coliseum {{on the morning of}} July 9, 1896, Tillman was the opening speaker. Although met with applause and shouts of his name, he [...] "spoke in the same manner that had won him success in South Carolina, cursing, haranguing his enemies, and raising the specter of sectionalism. He, however, thoroughly alienated the national audience". According to Richard Bensel in his study of the 1896 convention, Tillman gave [...] "by far, the most divisive speech of the convention, an address that embarrassed the silver wing of the party as much as it enraged the hard-money faction". He deemed silver a sectional issue, pitting the wealthy East against the oppressed South and West. This upset delegates, who wished to view silver as a patriotic, national issue, and some voiced their dissent, disagreeing with Tillman. The senator alternately offended, confused, and bored the delegates, who shouted for Tillman to stop even though less than half of his time had expired. Beset by shouting delegates and one of the convention bands, which unexpectedly appeared and began to play, Tillman nevertheless pressed on, [...] "the audience <b>might</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> understand that I am going to have my say if I stand here until sundown." [...] By the time he had his say, he had [...] "effectively destroyed his chances to become a national candidate". With Tillman's candidacy stillborn (only his home state voted for him), Bryan seized the opportunity to deliver an address in support of silver that did not rely on sectionalism. His Cross of Gold speech won him the presidential nomination.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the grand}} jury hearing on the next day, Nye County Judge Mark R. Averill denied bail, as Mircovich's case {{involved}} capital murder. George B. Thatcher was Mircovich's court-appointed attorney, but had to leave town on June 1, 1912 for the Democratic State Convention in Fallon. Averill then appointed Patrick M. Bowler on behalf of Mircovich until Thatcher returned on June 5. The case was prosecuted by District Attorney Sanders. Witnesses testified that Mircovich had made threats against Gregovich's life, and was once thrown out of Gregovich's business premises.

Admiral Raeder wanted a front stretching from Dover to Eastbourne and stressed that shipping between Cherbourg/Le Havre and Dorset would be exposed to attacks from the Royal Navy based in Portsmouth and Plymouth. General Halder rejected this: [...] "From the army's point of view I regard it as complete suicide, I <b>might</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> put the troops that have landed straight through the sausage machine".|$|E
2500|$|Army {{men were}} {{generally}} irritated by Bacalbașa's comedy. Some {{ten years after}} the author's death, General Brătianu commented that Moș Teacă was the stuff of imagination, and propaganda [...] "for the naive".

As he explained, Teacă <b>might</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> be active in environments other than the boot camp, from the marketplace to the Senate of Romania.

2500|$|As {{with the}} {{literary}} culture amongst the educated of the time, Lin Bu's poems were discussed in several Song dynasty era commentaries on poetry. Wang Junqing remarked after quoting {{the third and}} fourth line: [...] "This is from Lin Hejing's [...] plum blossom poem. Yet these lines <b>might</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> be applied to the flowering apricot, peach, or pear."—a comparison of the flowers with the plum blossom to which the renowned Song dynasty poet Su Dongpo (蘇東坡) replied, [...] "Well, yes, they might.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Screams of Abel webzine, former Antestor member Morten Mageroy reacted with caution to the proliferation of unblack bands: [...] "I really hope that people (who play Christian black metal) {{know what they are}} doing. I know this sounds very rough, but I have seen people being pulled into something they do not know. I am not saying that I know that these musicians are going to mess their lives up, but I have seen it happen to some people and it frightens me very much." [...] Mageroy, however, defends the unblack metal bands' intentions: [...] "A lot of Christian bands have done amazing things being led by God. I know that God is using many types of communication, and it is important that Christians is [...] present in every field, in every genre, privately and in work.

2500|$|The {{context of}} the poem {{has been the subject}} of much {{scholarly}} debate: Thomas McEvilley calls it the [...] "central controversy" [...] about the poem. [...] Wilamowitz suggested that the poem was a wedding song, and that the man mentioned in the initial stanza of the poem was the bridegroom. [...] A poem in the Greek Anthology which echoes the first stanza of the poem is explicitly about a wedding; this perhaps strengthens the argument that fragment 31 was written as a wedding song. [...] Since the second half of the twentieth century, scholars have tended to follow Denys Page in dismissing this argument. William Race, for instance, says that the poem contains nothing to indicate that it is about a wedding, while Christina Clark argues that, though the interaction between the two characters observed by the speaker indicates that they are of similar social status, their interaction is likely to be compatible with a number of possible relationships, not just that between a bride and groom.

Why should he think that she would set herself against the match? He had certainly spoken to Clara of the difference in their rank; but, after all, it was no uncommon thing for an earl's daughter to marry a commoner.
