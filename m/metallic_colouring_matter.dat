50|$|Heavier foils made of {{aluminium}} {{are used for}} art, decoration, and crafts, especially in bright <b>metallic</b> <b>colours.</b> <b>Metallic</b> aluminium, normally silvery in colour, {{can be made to}} take on other colours through anodisation. Anodising creates an oxide layer on the aluminium surface that can accept coloured dyes or metallic salts, depending on the process used. In this way, aluminium is used to create an inexpensive gold foil that actually contains no gold, and many other bright <b>metallic</b> <b>colours.</b> These foils are sometimes used in distinctive packaging.|$|R

50|$|Cheloderus childreni {{can reach}} {{a length of}} about 27 - 45 mm. This species, {{traditionally}} classified within the Cerambycidae and recently included in a new Oxypeltidae family, {{do not have any}} morphologic resemblance with the other cerambycids. The body is massive and characterised by a nice <b>metallic</b> <b>colour,</b> green on head and prothorax, and red on elytra. Their antennae and legs have a blue <b>metallic</b> <b>colour.</b> The head, round and small, has two robustly toothed antennae, the pronotum is furnished with two lateral ridges, and the elytra, covered by strong puncture, are bitoothed at the apex. The posterior wings are membranous and unusually pigmented in respect of all other groups of cerambycids.
