40|$|Virtual reality (VR) is an {{emerging}} technology that has many potential applications in manufacturing.

5000|$|Historically {{there has}} been {{reliance}} on custom or proprietary links and protocols to exchange real time data between systems. ICCP began {{as an effort to}} develop an international standard for real-time data exchange within the electric power utility industry. A working group was formed in 1991 to develop a protocol standard, develop a prototype to test the specification, submit the specification to the IEC for standardisation and carry out interoperability testing between developing vendors. The initial driver was to meet European Common Market requirements in 1992. The official designation of the first protocol was TASE.1 (Telecontrol Application Service Element-1). The second protocol TASE.2 [...] making use of the Manufacturing <b>Message</b> <b>Specification</b> (MMS) appears to be the version that has become the most popular.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} PROFIBUS {{goes back to}} a {{publicly}} promoted plan for an association which started in Germany in 1986 and for which 21 companies and institutes devised a master project plan called [...] "fieldbus". The goal was to implement and spread {{the use of a}} bit-serial field bus based on the basic requirements of the field device interfaces. For this purpose, member companies agreed to support a common technical concept for production (i.e. discrete or factory automation) and process automation. First, the complex communication protocol Profibus FMS (Field bus <b>Message</b> <b>Specification),</b> which was tailored for demanding communication tasks, was specified. Subsequently in 1993, the specification for the simpler and thus considerably faster protocol PROFIBUS DP (Decentralised Peripherals) was completed. Profibus FMS is used for (non-deterministic) communication of data between Profibus Masters. Profibus DP is a protocol made for (deterministic) communication between Profibus masters and their remote I/O slaves.|$|E

Most implementation defects {{fall into one of}} three categories of well defined message constraints. However, the general process of constructing network protocol stacks and systems does not capture these categorical con- straints. We introduce a systems programming language with new abstractions that capture these constraints. Safe and efficient implementations of standard message handling operations are synthesized by our compiler, and whole-program analysis is used to ensure constraints are never violated.

The anArray field is a fixed length 100 element array of integers that {{must be in the}} range 0 to 1000. The '...' extensibility marker means that the FooHistory <b>message</b> <b>specification</b> may have additional fields in a future versions of the specification; systems compliant with one version should be able to receive and transmit transactions from a later version, though able to process only the fields specified in the earlier version. Good ASN.1 compilers will generate (in C, C++, Java, etc.) source code that will automatically check that transactions fall within these constraints. Transactions that violate the constraints should not be accepted from, or presented to, the application. Constraint management in this layer significantly simplifies protocol specification because the applications will be protected from constraint violations, reducing risk and cost.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Most {{existing}} routing mechanisms today {{differ in}} routing objectives and routing strategies, however all the existing routing protocols {{have in common}} that the routing objective and destination specification are fixed, and that the routing objective is incorporated only implicitly. In this paper, we propose a general <b>message</b> <b>specification</b> mechanism to explicitly encode the routing destinations, constraints and objectives in messages, so that general-purpose instead of objective or destination specific routing strategies can be applied. Using general-purpose routing strategies while specifying quality-of-service (QoS) properties at the application layer explicitly in messages, QoS-aware strategies for individual messages are obtained. We also propose two frameworks of general-purpose routing strategies {{for this type of}} <b>message</b> <b>specification.</b> I...|$|E

To be an {{effective}} platform for performance-sensitive realtime systems, commodity-off-the-shelf (COTS) distributed object computing (DOC) middleware must support application quality of service (QoS) requirements end-to-end. However, conventional COTS DOC middleware does not provide this support, which makes it unsuited for applications with stringent latency, determinism, and priority preservation requirements.
