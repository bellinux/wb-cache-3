50|$|Prior to {{the coming}} into {{operation}} of the Divorce Act in South Africa on 1 July 1979, a decree of divorce could be granted by the court either {{on one of the}} two common-law grounds, adultery or malicious desertion, or on one of the two grounds introduced in 1935 by the Divorce Laws Amendment Act: incurable insanity for not less than seven years, or imprisonment of the defendant spouse {{for at least five years}} after such spouse has been declared to be a habitual criminal. Except in the case of insanity, these grounds of divorce were based on the guilt (or fault) principle: that is, on the assumption that, in every divorce action, only one of the spouses is to blame for the breakdown of the marriage, the other spouse being completely innocent. The success of the plaintiff’s action was thus dependent on proof that the defendant had wilfully committed a <b>matrimonial</b> <b>offence.</b> The guilt principle also determined the patrimonial consequences of divorce in that, failing a maintenance agreement between the spouses, an order for post-divorce maintenance could be made only in favour of the innocent party against the guilty party, and the latter forfeited all patrimonial benefits of the marriage if the former applied for a forfeiture order against him or her.|$|E
40|$|From the Ehegesetz of 1938 to its {{reform in}} 1999, adultery, refusal of {{reproduction}} and other matrimonial offences counted as grounds for divorce. With the absolute grounds for divorce, i. e. adultery and {{the refusal of}} reproduction, there was no further test on their destructive effects, whereas with the remaining ones, which were known as relative grounds, {{there had to be}} a test on whether the offence in question had indeed harmed the marital union. Following the reform of 1999 (Eherechtsänderungsgesetz) only severe matrimonial offences remain as relative grounds for divorce. A <b>matrimonial</b> <b>offence</b> may be any given behaviour of a spouse which undermines the founda- tion of their marriage. Thus, not just unethical behaviour such as insults or physical assaults but also too close (though not sexual) contact with a person of the opposite sex may under certain circumstances constitute a ground for divorce. In the past few years the claim of ‘unloving behaviour’, which may refer to a great variety of practices, has increas- ingly been brought forward in courts. For the judges it is getting more and more difficult to establish which of those should be regarded as a severe offence...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the concept of}} matrimonial cruelty in Australia during the twentieth century. Cruelty was a <b>matrimonial</b> <b>offence</b> in Australian statutes and grounds for judicial separation or divorce until 1975. Most allegations of cruelty were by wives against their husbands. Judges often espoused on men's role as husbands, their use {{of power and the}} nature of hierarchy within marriage. I examine the background of matrimonial cruelty as it developed within English common law in the Australian colonies until Federation. While claiming to be doing justice, the courts used the grounds of cruelty in a strategy to preserve hierarchy in the marriage-based family by the silencing of women and the empowering of men. The theory was that men were 'naturally' superior to women in ways that were good for the family and ultimately for social stability. Until the 1970 s, the Australian man had a legal duty to control his wife as much as a wife had a duty to obey her husband. The legal endorsement of patriarchy over decades reinforced misogynist attitudes in men as much as it provoked ultimately successful feminist demands for reform. Cruelty was abolished with all matrimonial offences by the Family Law Act 1975 however the controlling attitudes remained, to materialise in a new regime of domestic violence...|$|E

40|$|European {{scholars}} {{have in the}} past tended to look askance at the more permissive American divorce laws, but of late influential voices have been heard advocating a change in the basis of divorce law. The present climate of opinion suggests that there is a real possibility of a 2 ̆ 2 non-fault 2 ̆ 2 statute being seriously canvassed in the United Kingdom Parliament in the immediate future. Recent articles suggest that English jurists too favour 2 ̆ 2 departure from fault. 2 ̆ 2 The subject of this dialogue is thus a very live issue in England, as well as in some states of the United States and some provinces of Canada; limited 2 ̆ 2 breakthroughs 2 ̆ 2 have already been achieved in New Zealand and Australia; 2 ̆ 2 and, among non-common law jurisdictions, peoples so diverse as Eastern Europeans, Scandinavians, Germans, and Frenchmen have shown a tendency to relax their divorce laws.
