50|$|There are {{six major}} chains of seamounts {{on the rise}} — the Japanese, Magellan, Wake, <b>Marshall</b> Islands, <b>Line</b> Islands seamounts and the Mid-Pacific Mountains — and {{numerous}} minor clusters. The ages of these seamounts in general follow {{the motion of the}} Pacific Plate from 130 to 180 , as predicted by conventional hotspot theory, and decrease from west to east and north to south. This age-distance pattern is, however, not corroborated by the limited data available.|$|R
50|$|There were {{at least}} two {{versions}} of the movie: one with adult language and one with PG-rated language. From the outset, director John Korty did not want to use the dialogue of the original script, but actor Marshall Efron thought his lines were perfect and played up the raunchier aspects of his character. Some lines were selected by producer Bill Couturié. Korty was unaware of this until opening night and was angry about how <b>Marshall</b> Efron's <b>lines</b> were delivered from the script.|$|R
50|$|The Black Ball Line was a {{passenger}} line {{founded by a}} group of New York Quaker merchants headed by Jeremiah Thompson, and included Isaac Wright & Son (William), Francis Thompson and Benjamin Marshall. All were Quakers except <b>Marshall.</b> The <b>line</b> initially consisted of four packet ships, the Amity, Courier, Pacific and the James Monroe. All of these were running between Liverpool, England and New York City. This first scheduled trans-Atlantic service was founded in 1817. In operation for some 60 years, it took its name from its flag, a black ball on a red background.|$|R
50|$|After earning {{one first}} {{down on a}} pass to Yurachek, on 2nd-and-5 from the <b>Marshall</b> 33-yard <b>line</b> Litton threw a long pass that was intercepted by UConn cornerback Jamar Summers. Taking over at the Connecticut 10-yard line, Shirreffs led the team down the field, earning first downs on two runs and a pass to tight end Steve Hashemi. After a false start penalty on first down, the Huskies were stopped again at midfield, forcing a punt that was fair-caught by Reaves at the Herd 5-yard <b>line.</b> <b>Marshall's</b> {{responding}} drive was led by running back Keion Davis. He uncorked a 41-yard run on his third of five consecutive runs to open the drive; he would carry the ball on ten out of thirteen plays, running over six minutes off the game clock and forcing UConn to use all of its remaining timeouts. The drive finally was stopped at the Connecticut 15-yard line. Smith kicked a 32-yard field goal - his third of the game - to give Marshall a 16 - 10 lead.|$|R
50|$|The present Shire of Mukinbudin {{was settled}} by pastoralists {{who in the}} 1870s took up large leases in excess of 20000 acre to run sheep and by {{sandalwood}} cutters and miners {{en route to the}} goldfields. In 1910 the first of the farmers arrived to commence wheat growing on their 1000 acre block and it was some time before they added stock to what had been entirely a wheat growing enterprise. An extension of the Mount <b>Marshall</b> railway <b>line</b> to Mukinbudin and Lake Brown was approved in 1922 and opened in October 1923. The townsite was gazetted in 1922.|$|R

25|$|Following Japan's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Midway, King {{advocated}} (with Roosevelt's tacit consent) {{the invasion of}} Guadalcanal. When General <b>Marshall</b> resisted this <b>line</b> of action (as well as who would command the operation), King stated the Navy (and Marines) would then carry out the operation by themselves, and instructed Admiral Nimitz to proceed with preliminary planning. King eventually won the argument, and the invasion went ahead {{with the backing of}} the Joint Chiefs. It was ultimately successful, and {{was the first time the}} Japanese lost ground during the war. For his attention to the Pacific Theatre he is highly regarded by some Australian war historians.|$|R
50|$|Before the 1933 season, new Boston Redskins owner George Preston Marshall {{suggested}} to the NFL's owners {{that the league}} make some rule changes to increase {{the excitement of the}} game, including allowing passing from anywhere behind the line of scrimmage, and returning the goal posts to the goal <b>line.</b> <b>Marshall</b> then made another proposal a couple of months later: splitting the ten-team league into two divisions of five teams each, and having the winners of each division play each other in a championship game. Although the owners were hesitant at first that this brash new owner thought their game needed overhauling, the logic of his arguments won out, and they were implemented before the season.|$|R
50|$|The Huskies {{would not}} take {{advantage}} of this opportunity, but would soon get another. After earning two first downs after a pass to tight end Alec Bloom and a pass interference call on cornerback Rodney Allen, Shirreffs' 2nd-and-8 pass at midfield was intercepted by safety Kendall Gant. Taking over from their own 44-yard <b>line,</b> <b>Marshall</b> converted two more third downs on passes from Litton to Reaves and to wide receiver Josh Knight. Facing 3rd-and-1 from the UConn 20-yard line, fullback Devon Johnson's run was stopped for no gain. After a false start penalty moved them back five yards, Marshall opted this time to kick the 43-yard field goal. The kick was missed, turning the ball back over to Connecticut.|$|R
50|$|Marshall {{began their}} first drive {{of the second}} half from their own 25-yard line after the touchback on the kickoff. After a pass {{interference}} penalty on UConn cornerback Jhavon Williams moved the ball to the 40-yard <b>line,</b> <b>Marshall</b> converted three third downs as they moved down the field, on a pass play to Reaves and two runs by backup quarterback Michael Birdsong. A fourth third down play, an attempted pass from Birdsong to Yurachek, fell incomplete, bringing up 4th-and-2 from the Connecticut 17-yard line. After a timeout, the Herd eschewed another field goal and elected to go for the first down. Litton completed a pass to Reaves but for no gain, giving the ball back to the Huskies on loss of downs.|$|R
50|$|The widened road reserve {{now known}} as Marshall Park existed by 1893. Named for local Alderman H. Marshall and {{formerly}} known as the Kelvin Grove Playground, Marshall Park has long been used for children's recreation, although not officially reserved as a park and named, until 1978. An unsourced newspaper clipping held by John Oxley Library, dated 9 September 1922, includes a photograph which seems to show the fig trees in <b>Marshall</b> Park. A <b>line</b> of eight trees is already well-grown, reaching a height approximately three times that of a passing vehicle. Brisbane City Council plans for McCaskie Oval drawn in 1949 represent nine trees along the western side of Kelvin Grove Road. Photographs taken in 1958 confirm their large size {{by the middle of the}} 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Following his {{graduation}} from Minnesota in 1936, Bruhn went to Amherst College as football line coach and freshman coach in basketball and baseball.

He joined the Colgate University football staff as line coach in 1944, then moved on to Franklin & <b>Marshall</b> College as <b>line</b> coach, in addition to being head baseball and basketball coach.

He succeeded Williamson as head football coach, when the latter moved to the position of athletic director following the death of Guy Sundt. After his tenure as head football coach at Wisconsin, Bruhn remained at Wisconsin as assistant athletic director from 1967 to 1969.|$|R
5000|$|In 1915 Chambers was {{involved}} in a controversy with what would become known as a [...] "Tower Play" [...] during a game between West Virginia Mountaineers and the Marshall Thundering Herd. The Mountaineers were heavily favored and their head coach, Sol Metzger, told the media he would [...] "eat his hat if Marshall scores." [...] Chambers developed a special play to prevent the shutout. On the Thundering Herd fourth possession Marshall moved the ball down to the 15-yard <b>line.</b> <b>Marshall</b> back Dayton Carter came into the game. Marshall quarterback Brad Workman, took the snap and set up to pass. Marshall's tackle, Okey Taylor, and Carter ran toward the end zone. Carter was hoisted onto Taylor shoulders as Workman rifled a high pass in their direction. Carter caught the ball and fell into the end zone for a score. Metzger argued with the officials, but the referee and umpire could find no rule to discount the score. The Mountaineers won the game by a final score of 92-6.|$|R
