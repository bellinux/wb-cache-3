5|$|Leeman Bennett, {{the former}} {{head coach of the}} Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, served as {{chairman}} of the selection committee, which had the task of picking the best teams from those made available by the selection criteria set by the two conferences. The committee would have approximately onemonth to select the twoteams that would attract the <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> the game and generate the largest possible television audience. This fact helped eliminate ACC runner-up Georgia Tech from the selection process, as the Yellow Jackets had already played Georgia earlier in the season, thus making a potential Georgia-Georgia Tech showdown less attractive. In addition, that matchup, while attractive to football fans in the Atlanta area (the site of the Chick-fil-A Bowl and home to Georgia Tech), would have less appeal to television viewers outside the Georgia area. Supervising the selection committee was the Chick-fil-A Bowl Executive Committee, which consisted of representatives from various Atlanta businesses and the Chick-fil-A corporation.|$|E

25|$|Most {{mushrooms}} sold {{in supermarkets}} have been commercially grown on mushroom farms. The most popular of these, Agaricus bisporus, is considered safe for <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> eat {{because it is}} grown in controlled, sterilized environments. Several varieties of A.bisporus are grown commercially, including whites, crimini, and portobello. Other cultivated species available at many grocers include Hericium erinaceus, shiitake, maitake (hen-of-the-woods), Pleurotus, and enoki. In recent years, increasing affluence in developing countries {{has led to a}} considerable growth in interest in mushroom cultivation, which is now seen as a potentially important economic activity for small farmers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the preface}} to the US editions of The One-Straw Revolution, Wendell Berry wrote that the Natural Farming system would not be {{directly}} applicable to most American farms. Fukuoka's techniques have proven difficult to apply, even on most Japanese farms, and are seen as too technically demanding for <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> follow. It {{has been described as}} a sophisticated approach despite its simple appearance. In the initial years of transition from conventional farming there are losses in crop yields. Fukuoka estimated these to be 10% while others, such as Yoshikazu Kawaguchi, have found attempting to strictly follow Fukuoka's techniques lead to crop failures and require many years of adaption to make the principles work.|$|E

25|$|The {{two main}} sources of income are fishery and trade. As {{one of the most}} {{important}} coastal towns in the near surroundings El Jebha has an own harbour where many fisher boats, large and small, are anchored. Furthermore, the harbour is welcome and useful for many Europeans who are passing through the area in a tour around the Mediterranean sea. Next to the fishery there is also a booming culture of commerce and trade. The administrative function and the harbour of El Jebha are the two main reasons for <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> consider a visit, which in turn makes residents decide to engage in trade and commerce. Also, the location of El Jebha across the coastal route adds to its popularity as a centre of the district Mtiwa.|$|E

Of Ono, McCartney stated: [...] "I {{thought she was a}} cold woman. I think that's wrong..... she's just the opposite..... I think she's just more determined than <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be herself." [...] Two years later, however, Ono publicly compared Lennon to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, while McCartney, she said, more closely resembled his less-talented rival Antonio Salieri. This remark infuriated McCartney's wife Linda, who was dying from breast cancer at the time, and when Linda died less than a year later, McCartney did not invite Ono to his wife's memorial service in Manhattan.|$|E

A number of schools sponsor orchestras, steelbands and tuk bands, including the St. Lucy Secondary School Steel Orchestra. Music {{is a part of the}} curriculum for early childhood as well as primary and secondary education. The Barbados Community College has an associate degree programme in music. However, the University of the West Indies, though it has a campus on Barbados, does not offer degree programs in music. As a matter of fact, only recently has the University started offering students the opportunity to pursue a minor in music.|$|E

Additional refinements to this theory have shown that people do not adapt to all life events equally, as <b>people</b> tend <b>to</b> adapt rapidly to some events (e.g. imprisonment), slowly to others (e.g. the death of a loved one), and not at all to others (e.g. noise and sex).|$|R
