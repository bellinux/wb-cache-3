5|$|In September 1847 Busch began {{studying}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>at</b> Hanover Polytechnic. Busch's biographers {{are not in}} agreement as to why his Hanover education ended; most believe {{that his father had}} little appreciation of his son's artistic inclination. Biographer Eva Weissweiler suspects that Kleine played a major role, and that other possible causes were Busch's friendship with an innkeeper, Brümmer, political debates in Brümmer's tavern, and Busch's reluctance to believe every word of the Bible and catechism.|$|E
