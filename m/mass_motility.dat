Materials and Methods: A total of 60 ejaculates, 10 each from 6 mature Kankrej bulls, once in a week for 10 weeks, were collected and analyzed for various semen attributes. Result: The mean values for different seminal attributes were: ejaculate volume 4. 84 &# 177; 0. 01 ml, pH 6. 88 &# 177; 0. 01, <b>mass</b> <b>motility</b> 3. 72 &# 177; 0. 02, sperm concentration 1253. 83 &# 177; 14. 68 million / ml, individual motility 86. 15 &# 177; 0. 30 per cent, live sperm count 90. 58 &# 177; 0. 20 per cent, abnormal sperm count 4. 24 &# 177; 0. 03 per cent and acrosomal integrity 81. 17 &# 177; 0. 11 per cent. The colour of the Kankrej bull semen under the {{investigation was}} creamy white. Mean values of ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, live sperm count and acrosomal integrity of semen differed significantly (P < 0. 05) among the bulls under investigation.

40|$|Aim: The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the total seminal plasma protein (TSPP) and heparin-binding proteins (HBPs) in relation to initial semen quality of buffalo bull. Materials and Methods: Semen from two Murrah buffalo bulls (bull no. 605 and 790) with <b>mass</b> <b>motility</b> of ≥ 3 + {{were used for the}} study and categorized into three groups (Group I- <b>Mass</b> <b>motility</b> 3 +, Group II- <b>Mass</b> <b>motility</b> 4 + and Group III- <b>Mass</b> <b>motility</b> 5 +). Seminal plasma from semen was separated by centrifugation. HBPs was isolated and purified from heparin-agarose affinity column by modified elution buffer. TSPP and isolated HBPs concentration was estimated by Lowry’s method. The purified HBPs were resolved on Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to check the protein profile of two bulls. Results: The mean values of TSPP concentrations in bull no. 605 and 790 in Group I, II and III were 30. 64 ± 0. 12, 31. 66 ± 0. 09, 32. 53 ± 0. 19 and 28. 51 ± 0. 09, 29. 49 ± 0. 15, 30. 45 ± 0. 17 mg/mL, respectively. The mean values of HBPs concentrations in bull no. 605 and 790 in Group I, II and III were 3. 11 ± 0. 07, 3. 32 ± 0. 06, 3. 46 ± 0. 08 and 2. 51 ± 0. 08, 2. 91 ± 0. 05, 3. 10 ± 0. 03 mg/mL, respectively. Both the values of TSPP and HBPs were significantly higher (p< 0. 01) in bull no. 605 when compared to 790 in all the three groups. 31 kDa HBP was more intensely present in bull no. 605, thus may indicate its superiority over bull no. 790 in relation to fertility potential. Conclusion: TSPP and HBPs shows variation in concentration with respect to initial semen quality. Furthermore, presence of fertility related 31 kDa HBPs in one of the bull may be an indication of high fertility of a bull. In future, in-vivo and in-vitro correlative study on larger basis is needed for the establishment of fertility-related HBPs in semen which might establish criteria for selection of buffalo bull with high fertility potential...|$|E

Study Design: Completely randomized design in a factorial arrangement. Place and Duration of Study: Poultry unit of the Teaching and Research Farm, Oyo State College of Agriculture and Technology Igboora, Oyo State, Nigeria. The study lasted for eight weeks. Methodology: Dry garlic was processed to obtain its aqueous, ethanolic and methanolic extracts using standard procedures. The extracts were assessed for percentage free radicals scavenging ability and supplemented in egg-yolk citrate extender. The semen parts were randomly allotted to three extender containing different extracts in different concentrations and eight nested inclusion. The extender was diluted with the semen in ratio 2 : 1. The samples were assessed for semen quality Parameters: pH, <b>mass</b> activities, <b>motility,</b> livability and sperm concentration. The extended semen samples that possess sperm motility above 50 % were further considered for artificial insemination to assess in vivo fertilizing ability of the sperm cells. A total number of 120 hens were allocated randomly to each treatment at 5 hens/treatment. The hens were everted and extended semen was deposited into the intra vagina of the hens.

40|$|A {{total of}} 4063 young bulls of two {{tropical}} genotypes (1639 Brahman and 2424 Tropical Composite) raised in northern Australia were evaluated {{for a comprehensive}} range of production and reproduction traits up to 24 months of age. Prior to weaning, peripheral blood concentrations of luteinising hormone (LH) and inhibin were measured at 4 months of age. At weaning (6 months) blood insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF-I) and flight time were recorded. Body composition traits of fat depth and eye-muscle area were determined by ultrasonography at 15 months of age when additional measurements of liveweight, hip height and body condition score were recorded. Bull breeding soundness was evaluated at ~ 12, 18 and 24 months of age when measurements of scrotal circumference, sheath score, semen <b>mass</b> activity, progressive <b>motility</b> of individual sperm and percent morphologically normal sperm were recorded. Magnitude of heritability and genetic correlations changed across time for some traits. Heritability of LH, inhibin, IGF-I and of 18 -month scrotal circumference, <b>mass</b> activity, progressive <b>motility</b> and percent normal sperm was 0. 31, 0. 74, 0. 44, 0. 75, 0. 24, 0. 15 and 0. 25, respectively, for Brahmans and 0. 48, 0. 72, 0. 36, 0. 43, 0. 13, 0. 15 and 0. 20, respectively, for Tropical Composites. Inhibin and IGF-I had moderate genetic association with percent normal sperm at 24 months in Brahmans but low to negligible associations in Tropical Composites.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Understanding the {{interdependence}} of mitochondrial and cellular functioning in health and disease requires detailed knowledge about the coupling between mitochondrial structure, motility, and function. Currently, no rapid approach is available for simultaneous quantification of these parameters in single living cells. METHODS: Human skin fibroblasts were pulse-loaded with the mitochondria-selective fluorescent cation rhodamine 123. Next, mitochondria were visualized using video-rate (30 Hz) confocal microscopy and real-time image averaging. To highlight the mitochondria, the acquired images were binarized using a novel image processing strategy. RESULTS: Our approach enabled rapid and simultaneous quantification of mitochondrial morphology, <b>mass,</b> potential, and <b>motility.</b> It was found that acute inhibition of mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) by means of rotenone transiently reduced mitochondrial branching, area, and potential.

Materials and Methods: Semen collected from sahiwal bulls (n= 7) were evaluated separately for color, volume, <b>mass</b> activity, concentration, <b>motility</b> and viability using standard procedures. Pooled sperm samples from selected bulls (n= 3) were transfected with a model gene construct enhanced green fluorescent protein (p-EGFP) via lipofection method and confirmed the genome integration by PCR technique. Furthermore the effect of transfection on spermatozoa was assessed based on apotosis, viability and motility. Results: In the current investigation sahiwal bulls were selected based on their breeding records and better semen characteristics. Although the transfected sperm samples failed to show florescence under fluorescence microscope, PCR studies confirmed the successful uptake of the p-EGFP gene in to the host sperm cell genome. Moreover transfected samples showed a significant reduction in the viability and motility without causing any DNA damage induced apoptosis as demonstrated by DNA Ladder assay.

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out on Sahiwal cattle bulls {{maintained}} at the Artificial Breeding Complex, NDRI, Karnal, Hayana, India, to assess the effect of cooling using mist cooling and fanning on Sahiwal bulls in the dry hot summer season. Fourteen Sahiwal bulls {{were divided into two}} groups of seven each. Sexual behavior and semen quality traits considered were: Reaction time (RT), Dismounting time (DMT), Total time taken in mounts (TTTM), Flehmen response (FR), Erection Score (ES), Protrusion Score (PS), Intensity of thrust (ITS), Temperament Score (TS), Libido Score (LS), Semen volume, Physical appearance, Mass activity, Initial progressive motility, Non-eosinophilic spermatozoa count (NESC) and post thaw motility percent. Data were analyzed by least squares technique. Group- 1 was the control, whereas group- 2 (treatment group) bulls were exposed to mist cooling and fanning (thrice a day 15 min each) in the dry hot summer season. Group- 2 showed significantly (p < 0. 01) higher value in DMT (sec), ES, PS, ITS, LS, semen volume (ml), semen color density, <b>mass</b> activity, initial <b>motility,</b> progressive motility and live sperm...|$|R
40|$|The {{recent study}} was {{designed}} to estimate the effect of season on dogs' semen parameters in mature and pubertal males, before and after hormonal adding and precede the sperms viability after collection. Twenty local dogs were divided into two equal groups the first one aged between 2 - 3 years which represent the mature dogs group, and the second group aged 9 - 12 months which considered as newly pubertal males. This study was done in dogs cages in College of Veterinary Medicine – University of Baghdad from 1 / 2 / 2015 to 1 / 2 / 2016. The semen was collected by using artificial vagina twice weekly. The physical examination (semen volume, colour, odour, debris and pH) and also the microscopical examination (<b>mass</b> <b>motility,</b> individual motility, sperm numbers, viability and deformities) and precede both the viability of sperms every hour till ceased of individual motility and the effect of adding of oxytocin and prostaglandine f 2 α. The herein study indicated that there were a significant decrease in sperms <b>mass</b> <b>motility,</b> individual motility, sperms numbers and viability during summer season, nevertheless, the deformities increased significantly during the summer in both males groups. The deformities show significant differences between mature and pubertal males. The individual motility indicated an increase after hormonal adding to the semen, the individual motility also ceased after 12 hrs from collection in all seasons. This study concluded that the male dogs could breed during the different seasons of the year, and the summer season had negative effect on male reproductive fertility. The hormonal adding lead to increase the individual motility also the maximum period of survival of the sperms after collection not extended more than 12 hrs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Malignant cells {{appear to}} possess a special {{aptitude}} for survival. We attempted to prove this in vitro by acute nutritional and energy deprivation as a survival threat. A phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) survival test in cell culture allowed static observations. These were supplemented by classic and quantitative phase-contrast time-lapse microscopy. From one normal and four neoplastic cell populations, no cells survived 77 hours of exposure to PBS. Only G 3 S 2 derived from a human breast carcinoma survived 60 hours. Cells in sparse culture were more vulnerable than those in dense. Epithelial cells were more vigorous than mesenchymal cells. Cells of greater malignancy resisted longer. Evaluation in culture as detailed by digital holographic microscopy (DHM) revealed {{an increase in the}} compactness of the intracellular <b>mass</b> <b>motility</b> from norma...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of increasing ambient temperature on spermatogenesis and seIl quality of indigenous goat breed. For this purpose, seven Aardi bucks between 1. 5 to 2 years old were used. Animals were kept in thermo-regulated room at 21 °C for five weeks as a control period, and then room temperature was elevated to 45 °C for 9 weeks. The first four weeks were considered as an adaptation period and the next five as an experimental period. Semen was collected twice a week using Electro-ejaculator. Semen analysis results indicated that during the control period, semen criteria were normal; ejaculate volume from two excessive ejaculate, concentration of sperm cells, <b>mass</b> <b>motility,</b> percentage of both dead and morphologically abnormal sperms were 1. 51 ml., 3. 181 xl 09 sperm/ml., 74. 1...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{correlations}} of young bull and heifer puberty traits with measures of early and lifetime female reproductive performance were estimated in two tropical beef cattle genotypes. Heifer age at puberty was highly (r(g) = - 0. 71 +/- 0. 11) and moderately (r(g) = - 0. 40 +/- 0. 20) genetically correlated with pregnancy rate at first annual mating (mating 1) and lifetime annual calving rate, respectively in Brahman (BRAH). In Tropical Composite (TCOMP), heifer age at puberty was {{highly correlated with}} reproductive outcomes from the first re-breed (mating 2), mainly due to its association with lactation anoestrous interval (r(g) = 0. 72 +/- 0. 17). Scrotal circumference were correlated with heifer age at puberty (r(g) = - 0. 41 +/- 0. 11 at 12 months in BRAH; - 0. 30 +/- 0. 13 at 6 months in TCOMP) but correlations were lower with later female reproduction traits. Bull insulin-like growth factor-I was correlated with heifer age at puberty (r(g) = - 0. 56 +/- 0. 11 in BRAH; - 0. 43 +/- 0. 11 in TCOMP) and blood luteinising hormone concentration was moderately correlated with lactation anoestrous interval (r(g) = 0. 59 +/- 0. 23) in TCOMP. Semen quality traits, including <b>mass</b> activity, <b>motility</b> and percent normal sperm were genetically correlated with lactation anoestrus and female lifetime female reproductive traits in both genotypes, but the magnitudes of the relationships differed with bull age at measurement. Preputial eversion and sheath scores were genetically associated with lifetime calving and weaning rates in both genotypes. Several of the early-in-life male and female measures examined were moderately to highly genetically correlated with early and lifetime female reproduction traits and may be useful as indirect selection criteria for improving female reproduction in tropical breeds in northern Australia...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} the paternal contribution to stock reproductive potential in Northeast Arctic (NEA) cod (Gadus morhua L.). An equation for estimating total annual viable sperm production (VSP) was parameterised for NEA cod based on new and historical data obtained at the Lofoten spawning grounds. A {{principal component analysis}} indicated {{that there were no}} obvious changes in the relationships between the variable male traits each year which supported the use of a single equation for fitting the historical data. VSP was estimated in the time period the stock has been assessed (1946 - 2005). The parameterised equation resulted in approximately tenfold higher VSP than the original equation, but followed the same temporal changes. The VSP from the parameterised equation was used to predict recruitment in a Beverton-Holt model, but resulted in similar recruitment predictions as the traditional spawning stock biomass or total egg productions methods. Male characteristics were evaluated as possible important traits affecting the reproductive potential, including condition, GSI, drumming muscles <b>mass,</b> sperm <b>motility</b> and sperm density. Sperm density was positively correlated with GSI in 2007, but negatively correlated to fish length. No correlations were found in 2008 between sperm density and any of the evaluated male traits. Sperm motility correlated positively to gonad weight, GSI and drumming muscle mass in 2008. Some of these results may indicate that sperm quality is related to fish size. Indications of sperm quality related to fish size may affect the reproductive potential in exploited fish stocks where size selective harvesting can cause a lower mean fish size and potentially a lower sperm quality. More detailed experiments, including direct assessment of fertilisation success in NEA cod, may improve the parameterised equation which might narrow the gap of knowledge of reproductive processes at the population level...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the effect of supplementation of Flaxseed (Linumusitatisimum) oil on libido and semen quality of Nilli-Ravi buffalo bulls. Methods In this study, 12 adult healthy bulls kept at the Semen Production Unit, Qadirabad district Sahiwal, were used. These bulls were divided into three equal groups, A, B and C. Group A was kept as control, while in groups B and C supplementation of feed was provided by using flaxseed oil @ 125  ml/day and 250  ml/day,respectively for 12  weeks.
