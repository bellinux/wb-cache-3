5|$|The <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film {{acknowledged}} {{the responsibility of}} portraying the story. One challenge faced was acquiring a real plane for shooting; director Ram Madhvani and Rucha Pathak decided to re-create the plane because {{a major part of}} the film required shooting against the plane back-drop. It took them 48 days to build the plane, which closely resembled the original one.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{high demand}} for tickets, which RTÉ {{described}} as phenomenal. 4,000 applications were received for a capacity of 120 seats (originally 60 for Questions and Answers, which was subsequently doubled). A public invitation for comments and ideas on topics was issued by the <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show.|$|E
5|$|By 11,000 BC, the <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long blades had gone. Two timber {{platforms}} {{have been}} identified within the peat at Titchwell, and may possibly be rare Bronze Age (2,500–800BCE) survivals. Seahenge is another early Bronze Age site found on the coast at Holme in 1998. It consists of a ring of 55 oak posts and was built in 2049BC; a similar nearby structure, Holme II, may be almost two centuries older. A large Iron Age fort at Holkham enclosed 2.5ha (6.1acres) {{at the end of}} a sandy spit in what was then salt marsh, and remained in use until the defeat of the Iceni in 47AD.|$|E

5|$|It was {{announced}} in October 2007 that Manchester City Council were taking legal action against the <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sculpture, {{with the aim of}} completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture. In November 2008 this culminated in an out-of-court settlement being reached between Manchester City Council, the project's designers Thomas Heatherwick Studio Ltd, and the engineering and construction subcontractors Packman Lucas Ltd, Flint and Neill Partnership and Westbury Structures Ltd. The agreement was to pay the council £1.7m in damages for breach of contract and negligence.|$|E
5|$|Kerr {{became a}} {{successful}} children's writer, with the Mog {{series of books}} and When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit, {{which was based on}} her own experiences of fleeing Nazi Germany in her youth. Kneale worked with Kerr on an adaptation of When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit in the 1970s, but the eventual <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film version disregarded their script. Similarly, in 1995 Kneale scripted a four-part adaptation of one of Kerr's sequels to the book, A Small Person Far Away, but this also went unproduced.|$|E
5|$|Some 5,000,000 half dollars were struck, {{far beyond}} the actual demand, and half of them were melted. The {{appropriation}} did not cure the fair's financial woes, as fewer than 400,000 were sold at the premium price, and some 2,000,000 were released into circulation, where they remained {{as late as the}} 1950s. The pieces can be purchased in circulated condition for less than $20; coins in near-pristine state sell for about $1,000, far less than the $10,000 the <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Remington Typewriter paid as a publicity stunt in 1892 for the first specimen struck.|$|E

5|$|The makers {{confirmed}} that the film's first trailer would be released on 22 June, coinciding with Vijay's birthday. However, Murugadoss announced that the teaser was to be released on 1 July, ten days later. Upon progression, the teaser and poster launch event was delayed, following an injunction order from the court, which had directed the <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film {{not to use the}} Thuppakki title in any form. With the court case ending on 5 October, the first teaser was released in October 2012.|$|E
5|$|Today's {{economic}} {{position is}} very different from the 1950s, when its prosperity was based on chocolate manufacturing and the railways. This position continued until the early 1980s when 30% of the workforce were employed by just five employers and 75% of manufacturing jobs were in four companies. Most industry around the railway has gone, including the carriage works (known as Asea Brown Boveri or ABB at the time of closure), which at its height in the 1880s employed 5,500 people but closed in the mid-1990s. York is the headquarters of the confectionery manufacturer Nestlé York (formerly Nestlé Rowntrees) and home to the KitKat and eponymous Yorkie bar chocolate brands. Terry's chocolate factory, <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chocolate Orange, was located in the city; but it closed on 30 September 2005, when production was moved by its owners, Kraft Foods, to Poland. The historic factory building is situated next to the Knavesmire racecourse.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most Bollywood films which {{indulge in}} months of {{promotion}} before the release, Aashiqui 2 {{had less than}} three weeks for promotion before its release. A music concert where singers (who sang songs in the soundtrack album) performed to their respective songs was organised to promote the film. The <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film launched the Aashiqui 2 jackets, as seen in the film's poster. Statues resembling the signature image of the couple hiding under the jacket were placed inside various theatres. Due to the romantic theme of the film, it was originally planned for a Valentine's day release on 14 February 2013, but this was postponed because of production delays. The film's new release date was 10 May 2013, but it was released a fortnight early on 26 April 2013 in over 2800 screens across India. The film was not released in key markets such as UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|While Rand Miller stated Cyan {{would not}} make another sequel to Myst, Mattel (then {{the owner of the}} Myst franchise) offered the task of {{developing}} a sequel to several video game companies who created detailed story proposals and technology demonstrations. Presto Studios, <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Journeyman Project adventure games, was hired to develop Myst III. Presto spent millions developing the game and used the studio's entire staff to complete the project, which took {{two and a half years}} to develop. Soon after Myst III: Exile was released, Presto was shut down, and Exile publisher Ubisoft developed the sequel, Myst IV: Revelation, internally. Meanwhile, Cyan produced the spinoff title , which included an aborted multiplayer component allowing players to cooperatively solve puzzles.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, the Mint shipped five kegs {{of the new}} coins, each holding 10,000 pieces, to Chicago. Each keg held five {{bags with}} a {{thousand}} coins each, though in one keg, one bag was intentionally short four coins, as also in that keg was a cigar box containing four envelopes, with coins number 1, 400, 1492, and 1892 {{from the first day}} of production. The kegs were taken to the Chicago Sub-Treasury, and on December 19 at 1:00pm conveyed to Room 404 of the Rand McNally Building, the exposition's headquarters. There, Harlow N. Higinbotham, president of the Exposition Company, took mallet and chisel in hand and opened the keg, removing the cigar box. Placing three of the envelopes in his pocket, he displayed the first coin to the assembled crowd, then exchanged it for a check—Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict (later the Remington Typewriter Company and <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> official typewriter of the fair), was purchasing the first coin struck for $10,000 as a publicity stunt. That coin was donated to the newly established Columbian Museum (today the Field Museum). The Company immediately put the pieces on sale for $1 each, and the first shipment was soon all sold to those who lined up to buy them, had ordered them by mail, or had purchased them at local banks that were given allocations. No official packaging was provided; the pieces exist in holders supplied by various banks.|$|E
5|$|The {{unity of}} the Gospels is further {{emphasised}} by the decoration of the Eusebian canon tables. The canon tables themselves inherently illustrate the {{unity of the}} Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels. The Eusebian canon tables normally require twelve pages. In the Book of Kells, the <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manuscript planned for twelve pages (folios 1v through 7r) but for unknown reasons, condensed them into ten, leaving folios 6v and 7r blank. This condensation rendered the canon tables unusable. The decoration of the first eight pages of the canon tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean, where it was traditional to enclose the tables within an arcade (as seen in the London Canon Tables). The Kells manuscript presents this motif in an Insular spirit, where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with Insular ornamentation. The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches. The last two canon tables are presented within a grid. This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow.|$|E
