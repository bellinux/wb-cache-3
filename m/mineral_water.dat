By 1944, the SS had purchased 75 percent of the <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> producers in Germany and were intending to acquire a monopoly. Several concentration camps produced building materials such as stone, bricks, and cement for the SS-owned Deutsche Erd- und Steinwerke (German Earth And Stone Works; DEST). In the occupied Eastern territories, the SS acquired a monopoly in brick production by seizing all 300 extant brickworks. The DWB also founded the Ost-Deutsche Baustoffwerke (East German Building Supply Works; GmbH or ODBS) and Deutsche Edelmöbel GmbH (German Noble Furniture). These operated in factories the SS had confiscated from Jews and Poles.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{aimed to}} analyze 15 Romanian brands of <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> {{and in this}} purpose therey were bought from a hypermarket. The content of nitrates, nitrites and pH have been {{determined}} {{for each of the}} 15 <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> using the modern known techniques. A number of two-thirds (66. 67 %) of the producers did not specify the nitrates content of <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> on the label. The firms which mentioned the content of nitrates on the label have not been correct as the tested value of nitrates was higher than the one stated on the label. The mean of nitrates in the tested <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> was 5. 89 ± 2. 88 mg/l, well below the maximum limits (50 mg/l). The fact that most producers do not specify the <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> nitrites content, this is not a health issue for consumers, because the research results showed that the presence of nitrites in the Romanian <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> is extremely low, somewhere besides the detection limits of the analytical method used. The nitrites content of tested <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> was significantly lower in waters with a greater pH. In fact, the increasing the pH of <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> by one unit, determined the reducing of nitrites amount by about 32 % (r = 0. 57 *).

5|$|The natural {{untreated}} water is generally devoid of all minerals, bacteria, and suspended matter, approaching {{the purity of}} distilled water. In 1987 Malvern gained official EU status as a natural <b>mineral</b> <b>water,</b> a mark of purity and quality. However, in spite of regular quality analysis, Malvern's reputation for purity suffered a blow when the rock that filters the water dried out during 2006, allowing the water from heavy storms to flow through it too quickly for the natural filtering process to take place efficiently. Due to the slight impurities, the Coca-Cola Company, manufacturer of the Schweppes brand, had to install filtration equipment, which reclassifies the water as spring water under European Union law. Consequently, the labels were change from: Malvern The Original English Natural <b>Mineral</b> <b>Water.</b> Naturally filtered through Pre-Cambrian granite and sourced from deep beneath the Malvern Hills. to read The Original English Water Bottled in the Malvern Hills.|$|E

The therapeutic effects of <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> are determined by their anion and cation content, the presence of undissociated salts and also by the presence of oligoelements. Additionally, the effects of a <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> are connected with physical constants: osmotic pressure and temperature. Many researches showed activity of the <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> on intestinal autonomic nerves and plexus (CIA), motility, exocrine, endocrine and paracrine digestive secretions and therapeutic properties belonging to evidence based medicine. Mud and bath therapy are effective in treatment of osteoartrhitis. During and after mud-therapy effects on diencephalic-pituitary-adrenal axis were displayed, producing increase of endogenous opioids and cortisol. Clinical controlled trials showed significant improvement of symptoms as pain and stiffness. Inhalant therapy by sulphureous and salsojodic <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> improve symptoms as cough and escreate and functional indices as FEV 1 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The oligomineral waters are very useful in the treatment and secondary prevention of urolithiasis and of relapses of urinary stones after spontaneous expulsion, surgical treatment, stones removal by percutaneous or uretheroendoscopic treatment and lithotrypsia. Patients must drink at least 2 L every day, substantially for ever. Chlorurate-sodic and bicarbonate <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> show improevement in disorders of lipidic and urate metabolism.

The town engaged John McLaren, landscape architect of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, to design the park, renamed Lithia Springs Park, later shortened to Lithia Park. Although the park was popular, the mineral spa plans proved too expensive for local taxpayers and were abandoned in 1916.
