40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatography with fluorescence (HPLC-F) detector was examined to simultaneous determination of airborne carbamates {{in the workplace}} of manufactory. The OVS- 2 air sampling tube filled with glass fiber filter or quartz fiber and combined filter/XAD- 2 were evaluated to collect nine commonly used carbamates (Carbofuran, Isoprocarb, Methomyl, Metolcarb, Thiodicarb, Carbaryl, Oxamyl, Methiocarb, and Prpoxur) from the air of manufactory in high humidity country. After being extracted with acetonitrile from sampling tubes, the carbamates were determined by {{high performance}} liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection posterior to on-line derivatization. The collection of carbamates and the recovery of extraction from glass wool fiber in several concentration levels, and from quartz filter were evaluated. The storage stability of carbamates was also tested. Results indicated that the HPLC-fluorescence method offers satisfactory resolution and sensitivity in carbamate analysis. With the glass fiber filter and combined filter/XAD- 2, the Carbofuran, Isoprocarb, <b>Methomyl,</b> Metolcarb, <b>and</b> <b>Thiodicarb</b> were stable for a 28 -day storage test, Carbaryl and Oxamyl for 14 days, and Methiocarb and Prpoxur for 7 days.

Four laboratory bioassays, including 1) proboscis extension and 2) gustatory response, 3) lethal concentration, and 4) mean lethal time to mortality, were used to investigate the effects of seventeen insecticides mixed with two sugar feeding stimulants on feeding behavior and mortality of pheromone trap captured adult male corn earworms, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), to screen and evaluate toxicants for use in an attracticide formulation. Commercially-available formulations of acephate, boric acid, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, DDVP, dimethoate, endosulfan, imidacloprid, lambda-cyhalothrin, malathion, methomyl, oxamyl, profenofos, sulprofos, <b>and</b> <b>thiodicarb,</b> mixed with two concentrations of sucrose and fi-uctose feeding stimulants at toxicant concentrations up to 10, 000 ppm AI (I%) (wt:vol), were evaluated for proboscis extension response.

Five white rot fungal isolates labeled WR 1, WR 2, WR 4, WR 9 and WR 15 were cultured in a medium containing <b>methomyl</b> <b>and</b> diazinon pesticides as the only carbon source and incubated at 280 C and monitored for biodegradation at intervals of 10 days for a period of 100 days. Gilson HPLC system was used for the separation and quantification of the pesticides. The pesticide methomyl was detected at 4. 9 minutes while the methomyl metabolite was detected at 4. 1 minutes. Diazinon was detected at 11 minutes while the diazinon metabolites; diazoxon and oxypyrimidine were detected at 2. 3 and 2. 6 minutes. The rate of biodegradation of pesticides was much higher for mixtures of fungi (approximately 50 days) compared to individual isolates (60 - 100 days) for diazinon while methomyl was 22 - 25 days. This shows that fungal mixtures in soil fasten the rate of biodegradation of pollutants compared to individual isolates.

It could be concluded that methomyl was the most toxic pesticide followed by carbofuran against the land snail and their mode of action could be due to the induction of oxidative stress in addition to their anticholinesterase potencies. Chlorpyrifos or paraquat had slightly effects to alter the biomarkers of oxidative stress in the snail...|$|R
40|$|With {{the passage}} of the FQPA (1996), EPA was {{required}} to consider available information concerning the cumulative effects on human health resulting from exposure to multiple chemicals that have a common mechanism of toxicity. In 2001, the Agency identified the N-methyl carbamate (NMC) pesticides as a group which shares a common mechanism and published a preliminary Cumulative Risk Assessment (CRA) in 2005. A cumulative risk assessment incorporates exposures from multiple pathways (i. e., food, drinking water, and residential/non-occupational exposure to pesticides in air, or on soil, grass, and indoor surfaces) for those chemicals with a common mechanism of toxicity. Since the release of the preliminary NMC CRA, the Agency has incorporated new hazard and exposure data, assigned FQPA safety factors, evaluated comments from the public, and addressed comments by the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP). In addition, since 2005, the Agency’s Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) has completed several additional risk assessments for individual NMC pesticides (aldicarb, carbaryl, carbofuran, <b>methomyl</b> <b>and</b> propoxur) and, where necessary, established mitigatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissipation}} of (O-methyl- 14 C) monocrotophos and U-ring labelled 14 C-carbaryl was monitored {{for over}} two years in the absence and presence of other insecticides using in situ soil columns. The dissipation of 14 C-monocrophos from soil treated with non-labelled <b>methomyl</b> <b>and</b> carbaryl showed a faster rate of downward movement than in control columns tagged with the labelled insecticide alone. The same trend was observed in experiments with 14 C-carbaryl that dissipated more readily in soil treated with non-labelled monocrotophos <b>and</b> <b>methomyl.</b> In the presence of other insecticides the percentage of bound residues was generally lower than in control experiments. The bound residues {{at the top of the}} column were released at a low rate under conditions prevailing in the field. The overall half lives for monocrotophos and carbaryl estimated from control experiment were approximately 20 and 24 weeks, respectively. The data indicate that repeated applications of pesticides might enhance the release of 14 C-bound residues...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring for {{organophosphate}} and carbamate {{resistance was}} carried out on five major insect pests of cotton collected from 22 cotton-growing districts across India. Resistance was monitored in Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) and Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) for the period 1995 – 1999 and for Spodoptera litura (Fabricius), Earias vittella (Fabricius) and Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) in a survey conducted during the 1997 – 98 cropping season. Of the 53 field strains of H. armigera, only four were found to exhibit resistance to quinalphos, the highest 15 -fold, whereas all 16 field strains tested {{were found to be}} resistant to monocrotophos. Similarly, out of 40 field strains tested, only eight were found to express appreciable resistance to methomyl. Resistance in P. gossypiella to quinalphos was high in the majority of the strains tested. Of the seven strains of E. vittella tested, two strains from northern India exhibited > 70 -fold resistance to monocrotophos. Of the 11 S. litura strains tested, only four were found to exhibit resistance factors of 10 to 30 -fold to quinalphos and monocrotophos. All of the B. tabaci field strains exhibited resistance to <b>methomyl</b> <b>and</b> monocrotophos and susceptibility to triazophos. Practical implications for pest control resulting from the observed patterns of cross-resistance between quinalphos, monocrotophos <b>and</b> <b>methomyl</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Methomyl is {{currently}} {{used as a}} toxicant for the attracticide BioAttract in cotton and vegetables in China. However, methomyl is highly toxic to non-target organisms and a more environmental friendly acceptable alternative is required. Larvae of three lepidopteran insects Helicoverpa armigera, Agrotis ipsilon and Spodoptera litura are important pests of these crops in China. In the present study, the toxicity of 23 commonly used insecticides were tested on H. armigera, then tested the susceptibility of A. ipsilon and S. litura moths to the insecticides which were the most toxic to H. armigera, and the acute toxicity of the most efficacious insecticides were further investigated under laboratory conditions. Chlorantraniliprole, emamectin benzoate, spinetoram, spinosad <b>and</b> <b>methomyl</b> exhibited high levels of toxicity to H. armigera moths with a mortality of 86. 67 %, 91. 11 %, 73. 33 %, 57. 78 % and 80. 00 %, respectively, during 24 h period at the concentration of 1 mg a. i. L- 1. Among these five insecticides, A. ipsilon and S. litura moths were more sensitive to chlorantraniliprole, emamectin benzoate <b>and</b> <b>methomyl.</b> The lethal time (LT 50) values of chlorantraniliprole <b>and</b> <b>methomyl</b> were shorter than emamectin benzoate for all three lepidopteran moth species at 1000 mg a. i. L- 1 compared to concentrations of 500, 100 and 1 mg a. i L- 1. Chlorantraniliprole {{was found to have}} similar levels of toxicity and lethal time on the three lepidopteran moths tested to the standard <b>methomyl,</b> <b>and</b> therefore, can be used as an alternative insecticide to methomyl in the attracticide for controlling these pest species...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} {{experiments were}} carried out to evaluate three insecticides. In the 24 first one, the effect of two insecticides, <b>methomyl</b> <b>and</b> indoxacarb, on pupae and 25 adults of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) parasitoid Eretmocerus mundus 26 Mercet was evaluated under laboratory and greenhouse conditions, using sweet 27 pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) plants. In the second experiment, oxamyl was 28 tested to study {{its effect on the}} ability of E. mundus to parasitize and control B. 29 tabaci in sweet pepper plants, using a greenhouse cage evaluation. <b>Methomyl</b> <b>and</b> 30 indoxacarb caused low mortality of E. mundus pupae (17. 6 and 7. 8 % 31 respectively), although methomyl mortality was significantly higher. Methomyl 32 produced 100 % mortality on E. mundus adults with fresh and 24 hour-old 33 residues on leaves, significantly higher than the mortality produced by indoxacarb 34 (values ranged from 43. 9 to 34. 4 %). The harmful effect of methomyl persisted for 35 a long time (up to 60 days). The results of the experiment with oxamyl showed 36 that E. mundus controlled whitefly population, without significant interaction 37 between the presence of the parasitoid and insecticide on whitefly mortality. 38 Whitefly mortality {{in the presence of the}} parasitoid was 87. 8 %, significantly higher 39 than the mortality in the absence of E. mundus (59. 3 %). Oxamyl did not produce 40 a significant effect on the emergence of E. mundus adults. Application of the 41 products in IPM programs is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Terrestrial snails are {{destructive}} {{agricultural pests}} as they cause a great damage to vegetables and crops. The {{present study was}} designed to evaluate the toxic action of two carbamate molluscicides, <b>methomyl</b> <b>and</b> methiocarb on the digestive gland of the land snail E. vermiculata which is the main site of accumulation and biotransformation of xenobiotics, using topical application and baiting techniques. Sublethal doses and concentrations of both pesticides were applied. After 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 days of treatment, definite number of snails from each group were chosen and prepared for the aimed studies. Histopathological and ultrastructural alterations in the digestive gland were more obvious after topical application than after baiting technique <b>and</b> <b>methomyl</b> was found to be more toxic than methiocarb. These alterations included hemocyte infiltration,bizarre nuclei that ranged in their degenerative changes from karyolysis to severe karyorrhexis and complete pyknosis, after <b>methomyl</b> treatment <b>and</b> extensive destruction and disorganization of the intertubular connective tissue, after methiocarb treatment. In addition, severe cytoplasmic vacuolization, disruption and reduction of microvilli and formation of surface blabs, increased number of calcium spherules in calcium cells and an aberrant {{increase in the number of}} excretory cells containing large number of excretory granules or residual bodies were observed after treatment with both molluscicides. These results are important from the economical point of view since the use of low doses of molluscicides was shown effective, more feasible and less harmful to non-target species like vertebrate animals and human beings...|$|R
40|$|An amperometric {{biosensor}} for {{the detection}} of organophosphorus and carbamate type pesticides was developed. Acetylcholinesterase enzyme (electric eel) was immobilized in a thin-layer enzyme cell, and acetylthiocholine chloride (AcTCh) was used as substrate. Amperometric detection with glassy carbon electrode was performed in a stopped-flow FIA system. The inhibition effect of dichlorvos (DDVP), carbofuran, <b>methomyl,</b> <b>and</b> pirimicarb were examined: the linear measuring ranges were 0. 001 - 0. 1 mu mol l(- 1), 0. 001 - 0. 1 mu mol l(- 1), 0. 2 - 1 mu mol l(- 1), and 0. 1 - 10 mu mol l(- 1), respectively. Soil extract and apple juice were measured with spiking method. It was concluded that the biosensor can be used for screening pesticide residues in food and environmental samples...|$|R
