25|$|<b>Musical</b> <b>{{acoustics}}</b> {{or music}} acoustics is {{a branch of}} acoustics concerned with researching and describing the physics of music – how sounds are employed to make music. Examples of areas of study are the function of musical instruments, the human voice (the physics of speech and singing), computer analysis of melody, and in the clinical use of music in music therapy.|$|E
25|$|According to Danish {{noise and}} music theorist Torben Sangild, one single {{definition}} of noise in {{music is not}} possible. Sangild instead provides three basic definitions of noise: a <b>musical</b> <b>acoustics</b> definition, a second communicative definition based on distortion or disturbance of a communicative signal, and a third definition based in subjectivity (what is noise to one person can be meaningful to another; what was considered unpleasant sound yesterday is not today).|$|E
25|$|In modern academia, {{music theory}} is a {{subfield}} of musicology, the wider study of musical cultures and history. Etymologically, music theory {{is an act}} of contemplation of music, from the Greek θεωρία, a looking at, viewing, contemplation, speculation, theory, also a sight, a spectacle. As such, it is often concerned with abstract musical aspects such as tuning and tonal systems, scales, consonance and dissonance, and rhythmic relationships, {{but there is also a}} body of theory concerning practical aspects, such as the creation or the performance of music, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, and electronic sound production. A person who researches, teaches, or writes articles about music theory is a music theorist. University study, typically to the M.A. or Ph.D level, is required to teach as a tenure-track music theorist in a US or Canadian university. Methods of analysis include mathematics, graphic analysis, and especially analysis enabled by Western music notation. Comparative, descriptive, statistical, and other methods are also used. Music theory textbooks, especially in the United States of America, often include elements of <b>musical</b> <b>acoustics,</b> considerations of musical notation, and techniques of tonal composition (Harmony and Counterpoint), among other topics.|$|E

25|$|Music {{therapy is}} a non verbal {{approach}} to the person using instruments and music in general, the use of interventions to accomplish individual goals within a therapeutic relationship by a professional who has completed an approved music therapy program. Music therapy {{is one of the}} expressive therapies, consisting of a process in which a music therapist uses music and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients improve their physical and mental health. Music therapists primarily help clients improve their health in several domains, such as cognitive functioning, motor skills, emotional development, social skills, and quality of life by using both active and passive music experiences such as free improvisation, song, dance, listening, and discussion of music to achieve treatment goals. There is a wide qualitative and quantitative research literature base which incorporates clinical therapy, psychotherapy, biomusicology, <b>musical</b> <b>acoustics,</b> music theory, psychoacoustics, embodied music cognition, aesthetics of music, sensory integration, and comparative musicology. Referrals to music therapy services may be made by other health care professionals. Clients can also choose to pursue music therapy services without a referral (i.e., self-referral).|$|E

40|$|The {{similarities}} between biological and <b>musical</b> <b>acoustic</b> systems has {{lead to the}} idea that bioacoustics, and understanding of animal sound production, could provide models for new musical instruments. Physical modeling synthesis of these systems offers the musician the ability to manipulate natural sound, much in the same way s/he would a traditional musical instrument. In this research, the sound mechanism of the cicada is modeled and the musical potential of it’s vocalization is explored. The cicada instrument is programmed in C++ and runs in real-time. A glove, equipped with force sensing resistors (FSRs) on each of the fingertips, allows for control of parameters such as the volume of the cicada’s abdomen, and the stiffness of its tymbal plate...|$|R
