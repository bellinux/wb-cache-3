The estate of 6,200 flats, {{constructed}} on a site of 21 acre and capable of housing 46,000 people, offered a self-contained environment complete with commercial amenities ranging from markets and barber shops to banks. This represented an innovation in that the commercial premises would serve the local estate, while paying a rent determined by public tender. Banks, restaurants, and other large premises would be let out on a five-year contract, competing on a <b>monthly</b> <b>rental</b> offered, while tenants for smaller premises would compete on premium paid based on fixed <b>monthly</b> <b>rentals.</b> Unlike the generations of housing estates which preceded it, there would be designated market stalls and cooked-food stalls.

40|$|Using {{single and}} multivariate OLS regressions, this study {{examines}} how the listing price of a two bedroom home {{is affected by the}} <b>monthly</b> <b>rental</b> price of a comparable home in the same city. We do this in order to provide some direction to young families looking to purchase their first home. Our data encompasses each state’s most populated city within the United States. This study reveals that as the <b>monthly</b> <b>rental</b> price of a comparable home (especially condos) increases, and/or as the price-to-rent ratio increases, so does the listing price of a two bedroom home. Therefore, a frugal home buyer should keep an eye on both comparable rental prices, and on the price-to-rent ratio within their city of interest. When rental prices drop, or when the price-to-rent ratio decreases, that is when a homebuyer should begin to consider the purchase of a two-bedroom home...|$|R

40|$|South Korea has {{a unique}} kind of rental contract, called chonsei. The tenant pays an upfront deposit, {{typically}} from 40 % to 70 % of the property value, to the landlord, and the landlord repays the deposit to the tenant upon contract termination. The tenant {{is not required to}} make any periodic <b>monthly</b> <b>rental</b> payments. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} show why such a unique rental contract exists and has been popular in Korea. The model shows that chonsei is an ingenious market response in the era of "financial repression" in Korea (Renaud (1989)), allowing landlords to accumulate sufficient funds for housing investment without major reliance on a mortgage. The model also shows that the tenant, who suffers from insufficient mortgage borrowings, can access cheaper rental housing via chonsei than when only <b>monthly</b> <b>rental</b> housing is available. The model predicts that the chonsei system should fade out when arbitrage gains from housing investment disappear. An implication of the model is that the chonsei renter may save while the landlord and the owner-occupier put all their assets into housing and thus have no financial savings. This hypothesis is empirically tested and confirmed. ...|$|R

50|$|Lenders {{calculate}} {{how much}} {{they are willing to}} lend using a different formula than for an owner-occupied property. They tend to look at the expected <b>monthly</b> <b>rental</b> income to determine the maximum loan available. Depending on the lender, borrowers might also be allowed to include their own personal income in the calculation of the maximum amount that they can borrow. First-time landlords might also be required to have a separate annual income of at least £25,000. For an owner-occupied property, the calculation is typically a multiple of the owner's annual income.|$|R
