40|$|Infrared {{thermography}} is an {{imaging modality}} gaining popularity as a diagnostic {{aid in the}} evaluation of equine lameness. Anecdotal reports of skin hyperthermia induced by local anesthesia, detected by thermography, have been made; however, no controlled studies have been reported. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effects of perineural anesthesia on infrared thermographic images of the forelimb digits in normal horses. After environmental acclimation, infrared thermographs were made at intervals of 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 min from administration of <b>mepivacaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> or phosphate buffered saline in 6 adult horses with no clinical evidence of abnormality of the forelimb digits. The mean limb surface temperatures were compared by 2 -factor ANOVA. Results indicated no significant difference between treatments, time after injection, or an interaction of time and treatment. Infrared thermographic imaging apparently can be performed within 45 min of perineural <b>mepivacaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> anesthesia without risk of artifactual changes in limb surface temperature...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-two cardiopathic {{patients}} (mean age 54. 4 +/- 9. 9 years) underwent dynamic electrocardiography during {{tooth extraction}} under local anesthesia (<b>mepivacaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> 2 % plus adrenalin 1 : 200. 000). Heart rate (p less than 0. 001), systolic and {{diastolic blood pressure}} (p less than 0. 001) significantly increased during tooth extraction returning to values near to basal level in the recovery period. No patients showed significant changes in ST segment. One patient with chronic atrial fibrillation presented an increase in ventricular rate (180 beats/min) and appearance of premature ventricular beats, spontaneously regressed. In conclusion, in cardiopathic patients dental operations by local anesthesia with vessel constriction it is possible, provided estimated clinical conditions of patients...|$|E
40|$|Ischemic {{complications}} of the glans penis are rare and commonly result from trauma, inadvertent administration of vasoconstrictive solutions, diabetes mellitus, circumcision and vasculitis; we refer {{about a young}} man with severe ischemia of the glans penis following circumcision. The patient had undergone circumcision 5 days before in a surgery department under local anesthesia (1 % <b>mepivacaine</b> <b>hydrochloride).</b> The patient noticed a brownish color and edema of the glans penis at 24 h after he opened the wound dressing, but arrived to our hospital only 5 days after circumcision because these findings had progressed. Physical examination revealed the black color or necrotic appearance of the glans penis, and edema on the dorsal penile skin. The patient underwent antibiotic, antiplatatelet, corticosteroid and iperbaric therapy achieving a complete restitutio ad integrum...|$|E
30|$|The {{clinician}} visualised the cervix, cleaned it with {{antiseptic solution}} (Unisept®) and applied a single tooth volsellum to stabilise the anterior lip of cervix. The LA {{consisted of a}} direct intracervical block using 6.6  ml 3  % <b>mepivacaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (Scandonest, Septodont ltd.) infiltration deep at the cervical isthmus level at 12, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 o’clock positions using dental needle (Solo Supra). The cervix was dilated to a minimum of 7  mm and the MVA curette of 6 to 9  mm was introduced into the uterine cavity to commence the aspiration using a 60 -ml self-locking syringe (Ipas MVA Plus® aspirator). Typically, the MVA procedure consisted {{of no more than}} three separate suction events, initially rotating the syringe and then finishing with an in and out motion, lasting in total between 60  s to 2  min. The products retrieved were sent to pathology for histopathology evaluation.|$|E
40|$|Hyaluronidase is a goat {{testicular}} {{protein that}} hydrolyzes hyaluronic acid, a structural {{component of the}} intercellular matrix. It is commonly used as a spreading factor to improve the diffusion of drugs, including local anesthetics and chemotherapeutics. We experienced a 55 -yr-old female with generalized urticaria that developed within 1 hr after the epidural injection of hyaluronidase. She {{had a history of}} allergic rhinitis, and had suffered from post-herpetic neuralgia and a herniated disc for several years. To relieve her pain, she had been given epidural injections consisting of <b>mepivacaine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> triamcinolone acetonide, and morphine sulfate biweekly for one year. Hyaluronidase had been administered several times with these drugs before this episode of generalized urticaria. Skin prick testing showed a positive response to 1, 500 IU/mL of hyaluronidase extract, as compared to histamine. The patient's serum hyaluronidase-specific IgE level, determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), was markedly elevated, as compared to unexposed healthy controls. An IgE immunoblot analysis using hyaluronidase extract and the patient's serum showed IgE binding components at 31 and 21 kDa, whereas no corresponding IgE binding component was found in healthy controls. An ELISA inhibition test showed significant, dose-dependent inhibition with the serial addition of hyaluronidase extract. This is the first case of an IgE-medicated allergic reaction to goat (Naemorhedus goral raddenus) hyaluronidase, demonstrated by skin testing and a specific IgE and immunoblot assay...|$|E
40|$|Myofascial pain {{syndrome}} (MPS) is {{a common}} clinical condition of muscle pain. Previous studies indicated that local injection of physiological saline (PS) into a muscle is equal to or more effective than a local anesthetic for MPS. We performed 2 randomized, double-blinded trials of interfascial injection under ultrasonography for outpatients with MPS over 3 months to assess the effects of PS (pH 6. 0), 0. 5 % <b>mepivacaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (MH) (pH 6. 0), and bicarbonate Ringer’s solution (BRS) (pH 7. 4), and to elucidate their action mechanisms. Maximum pain related to motion, time of pain relief, and pain related to injection (intensity and duration) were measured up to 72 hrs. The first trial showed that PS decreased maximum pain related to motion compared to MH (p < 0. 05), although it increased pain related to injection compared to MH (p < 0. 05). The second trial showed that BRS exhibited as much efficacy in relieving maximum pain related to motion as PS (p = 0. 33), but decreased pain related to injection compared to PS (p < 0. 05). In conclusion, the interfascial injection of PS has a greater analgesic effect on MPS but produced stronger pain related to injection compared to MH. BRS is equivalent to PS in analgesic effect and produced less pain related to injection compared to PS. These results indicate that BRS is the appropriate solution for an interfascial injection to treat MPS, and that the action mechanisms {{are not related to}} the pain intensity associated with the injections or the pharmacological anesthetic effect...|$|E
