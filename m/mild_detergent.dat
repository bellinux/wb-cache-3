5000|$|The {{first step}} in {{preparing}} cells for cell cycle analysis is permeabilisation of the cells' plasma membranes. This is usually done by incubating them in a buffer solution containing a <b>mild</b> <b>detergent</b> such as Triton X-100 or NP-40, or by fixating them in ethanol. Most fluorescent DNA dyes (one of exceptions is Hoechst 33342) are not plasma membrane permeant, that is, unable to pass through an intact cell membrane. Permeabilisation is therefore crucial {{for the success of}} the next step, the staining of the cells.|$|E
40|$|Most {{mitochondrial}} carriers {{carry out}} equimolar exchange of substrates {{and they are}} believed widely to exist as homo-dimers. Here we show by differential tagging that the yeast mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier AAC 2 is a monomer in <b>mild</b> <b>detergents.</b> Carriers with and without six-histidine or hemagglutinin tags were co-expressed in defined molar ratios in yeast mitochondrial membranes. Their specific transport activity was unaffected by tagging or by co-expression. The co-expressed carriers were extracted from the membranes with <b>mild</b> <b>detergents</b> and purified rapidly by affinity chromatography. All of the untagged carriers were in the flow-through of the affinity column, whereas all of the tagged carriers bound to the column and were eluted subsequently, showing that stable dimers, consisting of associated tagged and untagged carriers, were not present. The specific inhibitors carboxyatractyloside and bongkrekic acid and the substrates ADP, ATP and ADP plus ATP were added during the experiments to determine whether lack of association might {{have been caused by}} carriers being prevented from cycling through the various states in the transport cycle where dimers might form. All of the protein was accounted for, but stable dimers were not detected in any of these conditions, showing that yeast ADP/ATP carriers are monomeric in detergents in agreement with their hydrodynamic properties and with their structure. Since strong interactions between monomers were not observed in any part of the transport cycle, {{it is highly unlikely that}} the carriers function cooperatively. Therefore, transport mechanisms need to be considered in which the carrier is operational as a monomer. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{qualities of}} the printed end product should fit {{the needs of the}} application. Longevity, {{fastness}} and hand properties are important. Post-processing is something to think about: is the printed material easily confectioned, applied or handled. Should it be washed or does it need a finish (e.g. fire retardant, water repellent). A washed textile no longer has coating or ink residues and will, therefore, have a better feel. Moreover, it will be less prone to stains and it will last longer. However, digital textile printing fabric will fade out with repeated washings, so it should be labeled as dry cleaning only, and the best way is washing by hand with cold water or using washing machine with gentle cycle and use <b>mild</b> <b>detergent.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Performing an ELISA {{involves}} {{at least}} one antibody with specificity for a particular antigen. The sample with an unknown amount of antigen is immobilized on a solid support (usually a polystyrene microtiter plate) either non-specifically (via adsorption to the surface) or specifically (via capture by another antibody specific to the same antigen, in a [...] "sandwich" [...] ELISA). After the antigen is immobilized, the detection antibody is added, forming a complex with the antigen. The detection antibody can be covalently linked to an enzyme, or can itself be detected by a secondary antibody that is linked to an enzyme through bioconjugation. Between each step, the plate is typically washed with a <b>mild</b> <b>detergent</b> solution to remove any proteins or antibodies that are non-specifically bound. After the final wash step, the plate is developed by adding an enzymatic substrate to produce a visible signal, which indicates the quantity of antigen in the sample.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAccording {{to current}} models, most newly {{synthesized}} peroxisomal intrinsic membrane proteins are {{recognized in the}} cytosol and targeted to the peroxisomal membrane by PEX 19. At the organelle membrane the PEX 19 -cargo protein complex interacts with PEX 3, a protein believed to possess only one transmembrane domain and exposing {{the majority of its}} polypeptide chain into the cytosol. In agreement with this topological model, a recombinant protein comprising the cytosolic domain of PEX 3 can be purified in a soluble and monomeric form in the absence of detergents or other solubilizing agents. Here, we show that this recombinant protein actually precipitates when incubated with <b>mild</b> <b>detergents,</b> suggesting that this domain of PEX 3 interacts with amphipathic molecules. Following this observation, we tested this recombinant protein in lipid-binding assays and found that it interacts strongly with liposomes inducing their flocculation or even partial solubilization. The implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Antibodies {{directed}} against VGKC were first reported in neuromyotonia. Further studies led to VGKC antibodies being recognized in Morvan’s syndrome and limbic encephalitis as well. It was {{for many years}} erroneously presumed that antibodies detected in a VGKC assay were targeted against the channel itself. But the heterogeneous presentation of patients was difficult to explain. The original assays {{for the detection of}} VGKC antibodies used Iodine-125 labelled dendrotoxin and the relatively <b>mild</b> <b>detergent</b> 2% digitonin on mammalian brain homogenate, and VGKC with complexed proteins was extracted. Co-precipitated proteins would thus also be detected in this assay. It’s now acknowledged that most VGKC antibodies are instead directed towards associated/complexed proteins. In a particular study of 96 patients with VGKC antibodies detected with the radioimmunoprecipitation assay, only 3 (3%) had antibodies towards the Kv1 subunit of the VGKC channel, 55 (57%) had antibodies against Leucine-rich, glioma Inactivated 1 (LGI1), 19 had antibodies reacting with Contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR 2), 5 had antibodies against Contactin-2 and 18 (19%) had antibodies with unknown specificity. Of the patients with Contactin-2 antibodies, 4/5 had antibodies against other antigens as well.|$|E

Conservation goals for totem poles can include stabilization of materials such as wood, paint or loose joints, removal of biological growth, surface cleaning, application of a water or insect repellents, removal of decayed wood, stabilizing of totem at base and in some cases the removal of the totem pole. Conservators who perform treatments on a pole document any work performed via photographs or written notes. A surface cleaning is a common treatment by conservators. The surface cleaning is generally performed with a low-suction vacuum, soft brushes, <b>mild</b> <b>detergent</b> and soft sponges. Cleanings are important for removing any dirt, grime, grease, pollution or dust from the pole’s surface. It is recommended by conservators to start at the top and work your way down.

50|$|In {{the process}} of maceration, the carcass is first skinned and defleshed by hand as much as is practical, and all {{internal}} organs are removed. In this process, extra care is taken when removing the eyeballs, ears and jugular muscles, because some bones are shallow and brittle, such as the thickened external acoustic opening of many mammals. The tongue is usually left in place, because of its attachment to hyoid bones. Severed parts of the carcass are sometimes kept in nylon panty hose. Water is then put in a container and maintained a constant temperature, usually 35 °C though not warmer than 50 °C. Washing powder with enzymes (like Biotex) may be added, as it will soften the tissue. A <b>mild</b> <b>detergent</b> or emulsifier is sometimes used to remove fatty acids from the bone. When the carcass is put in the container, putrefying bacteria begin (or continue) to consume the soft tissue cells of the carcass, {{and will continue to}} do so as long as the temperature remains constant. After a few days, the water is replenished to maintain the bacteria, and some additional flesh may be cut away. Most medium-sized animals (like dogs) are macerated within about ten days.|$|E
40|$|Seven-helical {{membrane}} proteins {{represent a}} challenge for structural biology. Here, we report the first NMR structure determination of a detergent-solubilized seven-helical transmembrane (7 TM) protein, the phototaxis receptor sensory rhodopsin II (pSRII) from Natronomonas pharaonis, as a proof of principle. The overall quality of the structure ensemble is extremely good (backbone root mean squared deviation of 0. 48 Å) and agrees well with previously determined X-ray structures. Furthermore, measurements in more native-like small phospholipid bicelles indicate that the protein structure {{is the same as}} in detergent micelles, suggesting that environment specific effects are minimal when using <b>mild</b> <b>detergents.</b> We use our case study as a platform to discuss the feasibility of similar solution NMR studies for other 7 TM proteins including members of the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).

40|$|A {{cell-free}} {{expression system}} using an Escherichia coli extract was adapted for large-scale expression and purification of mammalian membrane proteins.

Tens of milligrams of protein were readily expressed and purified from an overnight cell-free reaction. Both reaction ‘mode A’ (proteins were expressed as precipitant) and ‘mode B’ (proteins were expressed in the presence of <b>mild</b> <b>detergents</b> to keep them soluble) were investigated. The combination of ‘mode B’ and the right detergents, used in the subsequent extraction and purification steps, is critical for obtaining properly folded proteins (CX 32 and VDAC 1) that can be crystallized and diffracted (VDAC 1).

However, fine-tuning of the system, especially to facilitate proper protein folding, will be required for each specific target...|$|R
40|$|Partial {{resistance}} of cell membranes to solubilization with <b>mild</b> <b>detergents</b> and {{the analysis of}} isolated detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) have been used operationally to define membrane domains. Given the multitude of detergents used for this purpose, we sought to investigate whether extraction with different detergents might reflect the same underlying principle of domain formation. We therefore compared the protein and lipid content of DRMs prepared {{with a variety of}} detergents from two cell lines. We found that the detergents differ considerably in their ability to selectively solubilize membrane proteins and to enrich sphingolipids and cholesterol over glycerophospholipids as well as saturated over unsaturated phosphatidylcholine. In addition, we observed cell type-dependent variations of the molecular characteristics of DRMs and the effectiveness of particular detergents. These results make it unlikely that different detergents reflect the same aspects of membrane organization and underscore both the structural complexity of cell membranes and the need for more sophisticated analytical tools to understand their architecture...|$|R

This allows purification of the chlamydial major outer membrane protein at high yield in very gentle conditions by using its differential solubility in Sarkosyl and octylglucoside in the presence of dithiothreitol. The major outer membrane protein of the L 2 serovar is an acidic protein with a pI of ca. 5. It contains three cysteine residues that allow it to form a disulfide-linked proteinaceous network responsible for the characteristic rigid outer membrane of the elementary body.
