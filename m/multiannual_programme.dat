This paper {{addresses}} the controversies experienced at EU institutional levels as to ‘who’ should have {{ownership of the}} contours of the EU’s policy and legislative multiannual programming in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) in a post-Lisbon Treaty landscape. It examines the struggles around the third <b>multiannual</b> <b>programme</b> on the AFSJ, i. e. the Stockholm Programme, and the dilemmas affecting its implementation. The latest affair to emerge relates to the lack of fulfilment by the European Commission of the commitment to provide a mid-term evaluation of the Stockholm Programme’s implementation by mid- 2012, as requested by both the Council and the European Parliament. This paper shifts the focus to a broader perspective and raises the following questions: Is the Stockholm Programme actually relevant? What do the discussions behind its implementation tell us about the new institutional dynamics affecting European integration on the AFSJ? Does the EU actually need a new (post- Stockholm) <b>multiannual</b> <b>programme</b> for the period 2015 – 20 ? And last, what role should the EP play in legislative and policy programming in order to further strengthen the democratic accountability and legitimacy of the EU’s AFSJ...|$|E

30|$|The {{difficulty}} {{to establish}} long-term agreements among MS regarding common {{migration and asylum}} policies seems evident, despite the progresses made since the first <b>multiannual</b> <b>programme</b> for Justice and Home Affairs. From Tampere (1999) to Stockholm (2010), with The Hague (2005) in between, {{the first decade of}} common policy in migration issues focused more on creating a baseline policy, dealing with border control and irregular immigration (Collett, 2014, p. 2). Though recent high inflows of asylum-seekers and refugees has brought to light the diversity of national approaches towards asylum and the issues of cooperation inside the CEAS, this is not news, since it has been a major issue of ‘EU’ropean asylum policy for the last two decades (Zaun, 2017, p. 241). EU lack of centralisation and leadership in managing immigration and asylum issues has ultimately led programmes to heavily depend on the cooperation between MS, resulting in hardly harmonised migration and asylum policies based on control and restrictive ideas. Thus, it is not yet clear how to address current issues such as the ISIS and new terrorist threats, the Lampedusa disaster and the management of the Mediterranean, and the so-called refugee crisis, among other challenges (Léonard & Kaunert, 2016, pp. 143 – 144). The European Agenda on Migration 2015 seemed to fill the after-Stockholm’s emptiness, identifying four core areas that need immediate action: reducing the incentives for irregular migration, strong asylum policy, saving lives and securing the external borders and a new policy on legal migration.|$|E

The status and treatment granted to undocumented migrants continues to be 'invisible' in EU policy strategies and responses. This is so despite the wide recognition and evidence of the vulnerability and insecurities these persons face in their access to fundamental rights. The 'policy gap' between current European policy-making under the third <b>multiannual</b> <b>programme</b> on the Union’s Area of Freedom, Security and Justice – the Stockholm Programme – and the results emerging from social science research funded by EU institutions has been assessed and evidenced elsewhere. This collection of papers aims at moving the debate forward by substantiating these findings with the experiences and knowledge of a selected group of EU umbrella (civil society) organisations and practitioners representing key institutions in Europe on fundamental human rights. The papers include three contributions arising from the conference "Undocumented Migrants and the Stockholm Programme: Assuring Access to Rights?" held in Brussels on 9 March 2010.

With the fundamental support of its Technical Working Group on Fast Reactors (TWG-FR), the IAEA defines and implements <b>multiannual</b> <b>programmes</b> intended to help Member States in improving their capabilities {{in the development}}, design and safety analyses of innovative fast neutron systems, with particular emphasis on the verification and validation of modelling and simulation methods and tools. Within sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) research and development programmes, significant efforts are nowadays devoted to the development of high fidelity analysis methods for the investigation of severe accidents scenarios. In a Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR), severe transient conditions (CDA- hypothetical Core Disruptive Accident) is the Design Extension Condition (DEC) resulting from the mismatch of power produced and power removed from the reactor and the shutdown system not responding on demand, typically under conditions of either unprotected loss of flow or unprotected transient over power events. The assessment of the consequences of a CDA in terms of radioactivity release to outside the containment system which may affect the environment and the public is of paramount importance from public acceptance point of view, especially after the Fukushima event. The objective of this new IAEA CRP on “Radioactive Release from Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) Under Sever Accident Conditions” is to make realistic estimates, through numerical simulation, of the fission products transport mechanisms in typical pool type SFRs, and to determine the fission products retained within the reactor primary vessel and ejected into the reactor containment building. The exercise will be carried out for a reference pool type SFR of 500 MWe capacity fuelled with MOX, i. e. the Indian Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR).

40|$|Reviewed by André FalcãoBackground: Similarity {{measures}} for {{the comparison of}} metabolic pathways can provide {{a better understanding of}} evolutionary relationships among species or strains and have an important biotechnological value for the pharmaceutical industry. Semantic similarity applied to enzymes has been used; here we show an approach using metabolites. While there is a number of methods to compare and align metabolic pathways based on metabolites, they are usually based only on their structural information neglecting their biological information. Results: In this work we present an alternative approach for measuring the semantic similarity between metabolic pathways by comparing their metabolites. This comparison is based on the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ontology, and can be useful in toxicology and drug discovery for assessment of biological activity of chemical compounds. We implemented a software capable of measuring the similarity between metabolic pathways present in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database and a preliminary analysis shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Conclusions: We have shown that semantic similarity can be applied to pathways whose chemical compounds are annotated in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ontology.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the EU-coordinated Multi Annual Pesticide Control Program (MACP) is the assessment of MRL exceedance (above 1 %) in food items available for consumption in the EU market as well as consumer exposure. The 30 food items currently included in the survey represent 70 % of the consumption of adults and around 74 % of consumption by children. Probability based sampling methods minimize selection bias, since every element in the population of food items has a non-zero probability of being selected. Using a stratified sampling framework based on food consumption, MRL-exceedance could be estimated with {{a margin of error}} of 0. 0075 (in terms of raw proportion) by selecting 683 sample units for 32 different food items. The participating countries can be considered to constitute strata since sampling is organized within the countries themselves, for each food item the 683 sample units can be proportionally allocated either {{on the basis of the}} resident population or the food item consumption, producing different allocations, the latter being the recommended option. A sample size of 683 is also sufficient to ensure that assessment of consumer exposure is achieved with the same margin of error and confidence.

40|$|Reviewed by Dulce DomingosAlgorithms {{for solving}} {{distributed}} system problems, such as consensus, often use timeouts {{as a mean to}} achieve progress, even if encapsulated in failure detection services. They are designed {{in a way}} that safety is always preserved despite timeouts being too small or too large. A reasonable timeout value is usually selected, such that the run-time performance is acceptable in the normal case. In this paper we transform a fixed timeout consensus protocol into a timeout adaptive protocol, showing how this can be done in a structured way and demonstrating the performance improvements that we achieve. Our results are particularly significant in networking environments subject to uncertain or varying end-to-end delays, such as wireless environments with several nodes contending for medium access. With the timeout adaptive solution the number of transmitted broadcasts per consensus execution is always kept small, despite the number of involved processes. In addition, the overall protocol latency is also improved when comparing to the static version. FCT, through the <b>Multiannual</b> and CMU-Portugal <b>programmes...</b>|$|R

CorreiaDistributed {{protocols}} executing in uncertain environments, {{like the}} Internet, had better adapt dynamically to environment changes {{in order to}} preserve QoS. In earlier work, it was shown that QoS adaptation should be dependable, if correctness of protocol properties is to be maintained. More recently, some ideas concerning specific strategies and methodologies for improving QoS adaptation have been proposed. In this paper we describe a complete framework for dependable QoS adaptation. We assume that during its life-time, a system alternates periods where its temporal behavior is well characterized, with transition periods during which a variation of the environment conditions occurs. Our method is based on the following: if the environment is generically characterized in analytical terms, and we can detect the alternation of these stable and transient phases, we can improve the effectiveness and dependability of QoS adaptation. To prove our point we provide detailed evaluation results of the proposed solutions. Our evaluation is based on synthetic data flows generated from probabilistic distributions, as well as on real data traces collected in various Internet-based environments. Our results show that the proposed strategies can indeed be effective, allowing protocols to adapt to the available QoS in a dependable way.

It therefore promotes capacity building for trade unions across Europe.The social {{dialogue between the}} ETUC and European employers supplements the national social dialogues in the Member States. The ETUC supports European Works Councils, and workers’ consultation and participation in decision-making.EU cross-industry social dialogue was formally launched in 1985, {{with the support of}} former Commission President Jacques Delors. It has evolved through three stages:I - (1985-1991) Bipartite activities culminated in the adoption of resolutions, declarations and common opinions, which did not have binding effect. II - (1992-1999) An accord between the social partners, signed on 31 October 1991 and subsequently annexed to the 1992 Maastricht Treaty {{in the form of a}} Social Protocol, enabled European social partner agreements to have legal force through a Council decision. In 1997, the agreement was written into the Treaty of Amsterdam (Articles 154 and 155 TFEU).European social dialogue led to the implementation of three framework agreements (parental leave in 1995 - revised in 2009, part-time work in 1997, and fixed-term contracts in 1999) via EU Directives.III - (1999-2005) In December 2001, the European social partners presented a [...] "common contribution" [...] to the Laeken European Council. In accordance with the 1991 agreement (Art. 155 par 2 TFEU), this moved towards greater independence and autonomy of the social dialogue.Since 2002, the social partners have concluded autonomous agreements on:• telework (2002)• work-related stress (2004)• harassment and violence at work (2007)• inclusive labour markets (2010)• a framework of actions for the lifelong development of competencies and qualifications (2002), a framework of actions on gender equality (2005), and a framework of actions on youth employment (2013). These are implemented by the social partners themselves at national, regional and enterprise level. The social partners' new <b>Multiannual</b> Work <b>Programme</b> runs until 2017 and foresees an accord on active ageing.In the field of {{collective bargaining}} and wage policy, the ETUC has coordinated affiliates’ activities since 1999.
