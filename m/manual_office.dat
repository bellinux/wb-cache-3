25|$|For {{compatibility}} with manual offices, {{two types of}} signaling were supported. In areas with mostly machine switches and a few manual switchboards, Panel Call Indicator (PCI) signaling lit lamps on the B operator's desk at the terminating <b>manual</b> <b>office.</b> The lamps illuminated digits on a display panel corresponding to the number dialed. The manual operator connected the call to the appropriate jack, and then repeated the process for the next incoming call. In areas with mostly manual switches, the Call Annunciator signaling system was used to avoid installing lamp panels at every operator station. The Call Annunciator used speech recorded on strips of photographic film to verbally announce the called number to the answering operator.|$|E
25|$|The {{panel system}} was {{designed}} to interconnect the offices of a city or a local calling area. Each office was assigned a two- (later three) digit office code. Callers dialed the office code followed by the station number. In most situations this led to six-digit (later seven) numbers. But from the beginning the panel system handled seven-digit numbers (later eight), for two reasons. Party line numbers were listed {{with one of the}} letters J, M, R, and W following the line number. The caller dialed the office code, the line number, and the digit corresponding to the letter. The panel system {{was designed to}} work with manual offices of up to 10,500 lines. To call a line in a <b>manual</b> <b>office,</b> callers dialed the office code followed by the line number, just as they would when calling a number in a fully automatic office. For lines 10,000 and up, callers therefore dialed the office code and a five-digit line number.|$|E

50|$|Originally {{designed}} {{along with}} the panel type telephone office, PCI was intended to allow subscribers in fully automated exchanges to dial numbers in manual offices {{the same way they}} dialed numbers in their own exchange. For PCI to achieve its purpose, the panel office sent the requested number to the <b>manual</b> <b>office,</b> where the number was lit on an operator's display. The switchboard operator at a PCI-aware <b>manual</b> <b>office</b> reads the number from the call indicator display and completes the call in the usual way. As a format of interoffice signaling, PCI is one of multiple options retained for compatibility in the #5 Crossbar switch, a later system which served as the platform for the initial DTMF push-button telephone services.|$|E
50|$|The {{panel system}} was {{designed}} to work with <b>manual</b> <b>offices</b> of up to 10,500 lines. Callers dialed the office code followed by the line number within the office.

The called number appeared on a lit display, enabling the operator to complete the call by plugging in the appropriate jack, and ringing the subscriber.|$|R
50|$|Because the {{operator}} only needed {{the last four}} digits of the phone number to complete the call, the first three dialed digits were not sent to the <b>manual</b> <b>office.</b> However, for two reasons, PCI always sends five-digit numbers rather than four (and the caller may need to dial eight digits rather than seven).|$|E

The last <b>manual</b> <b>office</b> in southern California was in Avalon, on Catalina Island, dating from a radiotelephone service installed in the early 1920s. Pacific Telephone later laid two submarine cables to link the island to the mainland. Avalon was converted to dial in 1978, using switching equipment 23 miles away in the San Pedro central office.|$|E
50|$|The usual seven-digit US {{telephone}} number {{consists of a}} three-digit office code and a four-digit line number within the given office. After a caller in a panel office dialed the office code, the sender looked up the type of the called office (panel, manual, etc.), and whether PCI was to be used. Then the sender found a trunk to the called office. Once a trunk had been found and {{the decision to use}} PCI had been made, the sender outpulsed the digits to the <b>manual</b> <b>office</b> where they were displayed for the operator.|$|E
50|$|If {{the central}} office was known by a name, but no letters were dialed, it was common to {{capitalize}} only the first letter of {{the central office}}, e.g., Main 600W or Fairmont 33.

Instead, they took the highly unusual step of adding a dial and trunk lines to every manual switchboard position. In this way, former Sunset customers could reach the former Home subscribers via their central office operator.|$|R

The manual 25th Street office in San Francisco, serving the MIssion, ATwater, and VAlencia exchanges, was converted by Pacific to dial in 1952.

50|$|When a {{subscriber}} {{dialed the}} number of a manual station, an operator at the destination office answered the call after seeing the number on an indicator, and connected the call by plugging a cord into the outgoing circuit and ringing the destination station.

The last routine <b>manual</b> <b>office</b> blood pressure (mm Hg) was obtained from each patientâ€™s medical record before enrolment.

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the Work Ability Index (WAI) as a tool to screen for risk of different durations of long-term sickness absence (LTSA) among <b>manual</b> and <b>office</b> workers. Methods The prospective study comprised a cohort of 3049 (1710 <b>manual</b> and 1339 <b>office)</b> workers participating in occupational health surveys between 2010 - 2012. The survey date was set as baseline and incident LTSA episodes of different duration (> 14, > 28, > 42, > 60, and > 90 days) were retrieved from an occupational health register in the year following the survey. Baseline WAI scores were associated with LTSA episodes occurring (no/yes) during one-year follow-up by logistic regression analysis in a random sample (N= 1000) of the cohort. Predictions of LTSA risk were then validated among the workers not included in the random sample. Results The odds of LTSA episodes at follow-up decreased with increasing baseline WAI scores (ie, better work ability). The WAI accurately predicted the risk of future LTSA episodes > 28, > 42, > 60 days, but over-predicted the risk of LTSA episodes > 14 and > 90 days. The WAI discriminated between workers at high and low risk of LTSA episodes of all durations. Office workers had higher WAI scores than manual workers. Consequently, false-negative rates were higher among office workers and false-positive rates were higher among manual workers at each WAI cut-off point. Conclusion The WAI could be used to screen both <b>manual</b> and <b>office</b> workers for risk of LTSA episodes lasting > 28, > 42, > 60 days. WAI cut-off points depend on the objectives of screening and may differ for <b>manual</b> and <b>office</b> workers...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{specific}} role of major socio-economic indicators in influencing food preparation behaviours could reveal distinct socio-economic patterns, thus enabling mechanisms {{to be understood}} that contribute to social inequalities in health. This study investigated whether there was an independent association of each socio-economic indicator (education, occupation, income) with food preparation behaviours. Methods: A total of 62, 373 adults participating in the web-based NutriNet-Sante cohort study were included in our cross-sectional analyses. Cooking skills, preparation from scratch and kitchen equipment were assessed using a 0 - 10 -point score; frequency of meal preparation, enjoyment of cooking and willingness to cook better/more frequently were categorical variables. Independent associations between socio-economic factors (education, income and occupation) and food preparation behaviours were assessed using analysis of covariance and logistic regression models stratified by sex. The models simultaneously included the three socio-economic indicators, adjusting for age, household composition {{and whether or not}} they were the main cook in the household. Results: Participants with the lowest education, the lowest income group and female <b>manual</b> and <b>office</b> workers spent more time preparing food daily than participants with the highest education, those with the highest income and managerial staff (P < 0. 0001). The lowest educated individuals were more likely to be non-cooks than those with the highest education level (Women: OR = 3. 36 (1. 69; 6. 69); Men: OR = 1. 83 (1. 07; 3. 16)) while female <b>manual</b> and <b>office</b> workers and the never-employed were less likely to be non-cooks (OR = 0. 52 (0. 28; 0. 97); OR = 0. 30 (0. 11; 0. 77)). Female <b>manual</b> and <b>office</b> workers had lower scores of preparation from scratch and were less likely to want to cook more frequently than managerial staff (P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 001).

Conclusion: Lowest socio-economic groups, particularly women, spend more time preparing food than high socioeconomic groups.
