40|$|Security is an {{important}} issue related to the storage and communication of data and information. In data and information security, cryptography and steganography are two of the most common security techniques. On one hand, there is cryptography, which is the secret communication between two parties by <b>message</b> <b>scrambling</b> on the sender 2 ̆ 7 s side and message unscrambling on the receiver 2 ̆ 7 s side so that only the intended receiver gets the secret message. On the other hand, there is steganography, which is the hiding of information in a medium {{in such a way that}} no one other than the sender or the intended receiver realizes there is a hidden message. Successful reverse engineering of cryptography and steganography give cryptanalysis and steganalysis respectively. Cryptography and cryptanalysis constitute cryptology (or crypto) while steganography and steganalysis make up steganology (or stegano). This dissertation consists of three parts needed for a scientific study of a cryptanalysis problem. The first part lays out a comparative survey of various cryptology and steganology techniques by analyzing and comparing different methodologies using a set of predefined parameters. This part offers valuable knowledge on the state of the art techniques used on cryptanalysis. The second part proposes a new lossless synthetic stegano-crypto methodology that blends together five cryptography, steganography and compression techniques to form a single methodology for mutual information encryption and hiding in images. The methods that compose the synthetic methodology are SCAN Encryption, SCAN Compression, SCAN Steganography, Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography and Regional Steganography with Segmentation. The synthetic methodology plays the role of a complex and difficult technique that we have to work on in an attempt to break it by using a reverse engineering approach. In the third part, a cryptanalysis attack against the proposed synthetic stegano-crypto methodology is presented in order for the important features (weak points) related to the method to be extracted and assist in the reverse engineering process of encrypted information in images...|$|E

50|$|A {{method of}} {{achieving}} the spreading {{of a given}} signal {{is provided by the}} modulation scheme. With DSSS, the message signal is used to modulate a bit sequence known as a Pseudo Noise (PN) code; this PN code consists of a radio pulse that is much shorter in duration (larger bandwidth) than the original message signal. This modulation of the <b>message</b> signal <b>scrambles</b> and spreads the pieces of data, and thereby resulting in a bandwidth size nearly identical to that of the PN sequence. In this context, the duration of the radio pulse for the PN code {{is referred to as the}} chip duration.

40|$|Information {{causality}} {{states that}} the information obtainable by a receiver cannot be greater than the communication bits from a sender, even if they utilize no-signaling resources. This physical principle successfully explains some boundaries between quantum and post-quantum nonlocal correlations, where the obtainable information reaches the maximum limit. We show that no-signaling resources of pure partially entangled states produce randomness (or noise) in the communication bits, and achievement of the maximum limit is impossible, i. e., the information causality principle is insufficient for the full identification of the quantum boundaries already for bipartite settings. The nonlocality inequalities such as so-called the Tsirelson inequality are extended to show how such randomness affects the strength of nonlocal correlations. As a result, a relation followed by most of quantum correlations in the simplest Bell scenario is revealed. The extended inequalities reflect the cryptographic principle such that a completely <b>scrambled</b> <b>message</b> cannot carry information. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures. Accepted version.

40|$|We {{know that}} it was the Spartans, the most warlike of the Greeks, who pioneered {{military}} cryptography in Europe. Around 400 BC they employed a device known as a the scytale. The device, used for communication between military commanders, consisted of a tapered baton around which was wrapped a spiral strip of parchment or leather containing the message. Words were then written lengthwise along the baton, one letter on each revolution of the strip. When unwrapped, the letters of the <b>message</b> appeared <b>scrambled</b> and the parchment was sent on its way. The receiver wrapped the parchment around another baton of the same shape and the original message reappeared. Julius Caesar allegedly used, in his correspondence, a simple letter substitution method. Each letter of Caesar's message was replaced by the letter that followed it alphabetically by three places. The letter A was replaced by D, the letter B by E, and so on. For example, the English word COLD after the Caesar substitution appears as FROG. This method is still called the Caesar cipher, regardless the size of the shift used for the substitution. These two simple examples already contain the two basic methods of encryption which are still employed by cryptographers today namely transposition and substitution. In transposition (e. g. scytale) the letters of the plaintext, the technical term for the message to be transmitted, are rearranged by a special permutation. In substitution (e. g. Caesar's cipher) the letters of the plaintext are replaced by other letters, numbers or arbitrary symbols.
