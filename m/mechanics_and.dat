5|$|After {{surviving}} the Holocaust, Librescu was repatriated to Communist Romania. He studied aerospace {{engineering at the}} Polytechnic University of Bucharest, graduating in 1952 and continuing with a Master's degree at the same university. He was awarded a Ph.D. in fluid mechanics in 1969 at the Academia de Științe din România. From 1953 to 1975, {{he worked as a}} researcher at the Bucharest Institute of Applied <b>Mechanics,</b> <b>and</b> later at the Institute of Fluid <b>Mechanics</b> <b>and</b> the Institute of Fluid <b>Mechanics</b> <b>and</b> Aerospace Constructions of the Academy of Science of Romania.|$|E
5|$|In the 21 st century, Whiteheadian {{thought is}} still a {{stimulating}} influence: Timothy E.

Brian G. Henning, Adam Scarfe, and Dorion Sagan's Beyond Mechanism (2013) and Rupert Sheldrake's Science Set Free (2012) are examples of Whiteheadian approaches to biology.|$|E

5|$|A {{committed}} autodidact, {{he taught}} himself grammar, arithmetic, <b>mechanics,</b> <b>and</b> shorthand. At weekends he taught at Sunday school and enjoyed playing cricket.

5|$|At Johns Hopkins, Urey and Arthur Ruark wrote Atoms, Quanta and Molecules (1930), one of {{the first}} English texts on quantum <b>mechanics</b> <b>and</b> its {{applications}} to atomic and molecular systems.

5|$|General {{relativity}} can {{be understood}} by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics. The first step is the realization that classical <b>mechanics</b> <b>and</b> Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description. The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.|$|E

5|$|After the Astros drafted Richard, {{they sent}} him {{to play for the}} Covington Astros, a rookie-level minor league {{baseball}} team in the Appalachian League. Richard started 12games for Covington, finishing with five wins and four losses. Despite accumulating an average of 11.41strikeouts per nine innings, Richard had trouble throughout the season with his pitching <b>mechanics</b> <b>and</b> control. In 56innings, Richard struck out 71batters but walked 52 and gave up 41earned runs, resulting in a 6.59 earned run average.|$|E
5|$|All of this cosmic {{evolution}} {{after the}} inflationary epoch can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum <b>mechanics</b> <b>and</b> Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10−15 seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of quantum gravitation {{is needed to}} break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras {{in the history of}} the universe is currently one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics.|$|E
5|$|As {{with its}} predecessor, {{gameplay}} is centred around Nights {{flying through the}} dreams of the two children. The main objective {{of the game is}} to fly through rings while gathering enough keys to proceed to the next level. Development of Journey of Dreams began shortly after the release of Shadow the Hedgehog in 2005, and was headed by Sonic Team veteran Takashi Iizuka. The team took steps to ensure that the game stayed faithful to the original, while incorporating a variety of new <b>mechanics</b> <b>and</b> features. The game's setting was designed to resemble England, especially parts of London.|$|E
