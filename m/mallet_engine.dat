2500|$|In the 1880s, {{the line}} to Buffalo was built, {{terminating}} at Buffalo Creek. A more modest shop was established here, including a seventy-foot turntable {{that had to be}} enlarged to one hundred five feet to accommodate the Mallets. There were only two ways to turn a locomotive around, and the wye alternative was very costly in terms of land area. Thus, Buffalo Creek had one of only two BR turntables capable of swinging a <b>Mallet</b> <b>engine.</b> On the rare occasion of a Mallet reaching Rochester, it had to be turned on a wye. The Mallet would fit into only a single stall of the Lincoln Park roundhouse; even then, it stuck out considerably in the back, so the railroad built an extension to the stall to enable the doors to be closed. The Buffalo Creek roundhouse lacked this refinement. When two Mallets were parked in it, their tenders not only stuck out but very nearly touched. To deal with this, the BR built the [...] "Malley House" [...] near the roundhouse; it accommodated two of the ninety-two-foot wheelbase engines.|$|E
50|$|In 1897, {{shortly after}} the railway company's foundation, {{the first of a}} new batch of {{locomotives}} was built for the NWE by Arnold Jung in Jungenthal. It was a <b>Mallet</b> <b>engine,</b> numbered NWE 11, with the front two axles in an inside frame and the rear two axles in an outside frame. The fleet quickly grew to 12 locos of which nine were made by Jung from 1897 to 1901 and three by the Mecklenburgische Maschinen- und Waggonbau AG in Güstrow in 1897. The locomotives were very reliable, but six had to be handed over to the military railways during the World War I (including all three engines built in Güstrow) for use in France, and they never returned from their wartime duties. The remaining six engines received new, larger boilers with a higher performance. In 1927, locomotive NWE 12II suffered a derailment in Thumkuhlenthal upon which it fell off the high embankment. The engine, one passenger coach and the luggage van were so badly damaged that they had to be dismantled on the spot.|$|E

50|$|The {{locomotive}} is externally {{very similar}} to the other <b>Mallet</b> <b>engines,</b> only the driver's cab is noticeably different, and all axles are mounted in inside frames (the older engines have an outside frame for the rear two axles). The loco is in working order and is generally used by the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways on the Selke Valley Railway in charge of scheduled trains.|$|R
50|$|Two of the locomotives, NBL-built no. 1655 and Maffei-built no. 1674, had the {{distinction}} of being the last two <b>Mallet</b> <b>engines</b> to remain in SAR service. They were scrapped in the East London workshops in 1962, after having worked on the branch line between Amabele and Umtata in Transkei for most of their service lives and then having spent their last years in shunting service in East London.|$|R
50|$|The 0-10-0 was {{not very}} popular in the United States and North America in general and {{probably}} fewer than seventy of this type were constructed. For switching work, large 0-8-0 locomotives were preferred, and when more than four driven axles were required, the preference was for articulated locomotives such as 0-6-6-0 and 0-8-8-0 <b>Mallet</b> <b>engines.</b> On mainlines, a 2-10-0 with the added stability of its leading truck, or a 2-10-2 or 2-10-4 with room for larger fireboxes, were preferred.|$|R
50|$|In 1914 {{the first}} {{units of the}} most {{powerful}} Bavarian steam locomotive, the Class Gt 2x4/4 <b>Mallet</b> tank <b>engine</b> (later DRG Class 96.0) entered service. This was used in pusher service to support trains on the steeper Bavarian inclines.|$|R
50|$|Built by ALCO, this {{locomotive}} is a <b>Mallet</b> Compound <b>engine,</b> {{built for}} the Taupo Totara Timber Co for use on their 51-mile private tramway system, the Mokai Tramway between Putaruru and Mokai in the North Island. It is now preserved on the Glenbrook Vintage Railway, near Auckland, New Zealand and now carries the number 4. The engine is currently out of service awaiting overhaul, but can still be seen at the railway's Pukeoware workshops.|$|R
50|$|During 1914, the {{requirement}} for locomotives with a high tractive effort {{to cope with the}} increasing volume of coal traffic between Witbank and Germiston led to the introduction of a heavy <b>Mallet</b> compound superheated <b>engine</b> with a 2-6-6-2 wheel arrangement.|$|R
50|$|Within the T 13 {{class of}} {{locomotives}} {{were also the}} five <b>Mallet</b> tank <b>engines</b> that were taken over on 1 January 1913 along with the Bergheimer Kreisbahn and Mödrath-Liblar-Brühler railway west of the Rhine. This handful of B'B n4vt engines was acquired by the Royal Prussian Railway Division of Cöln (Cologne) and they were numbered as Cöln 7946-7950. They were the only Mallet tank locomotives in Prussia. At the same time several locomotives of the Hohenzollern version were delivered to the Filderbahn and Moselbahn. The Cologne engines were retired in 1920/21.|$|R
2500|$|As a rule, [...] "shunting engines" [...] (US: {{switching}} engines) omitted leading and trailing bogies, both to maximise {{tractive effort}} available {{and to reduce}} wheelbase. Speed was unimportant; making the smallest engine (and therefore smallest fuel consumption) for the tractive effort was paramount. Driving wheels were small and usually supported the firebox {{as well as the}} main section of the boiler. Banking engines (US: helper engines) tended to follow the principles of shunting engines, except that the wheelbase limitation did not apply, so banking engines tended to have more driving wheels. In the US, this process eventually resulted in the <b>Mallet</b> type <b>engine</b> with its many driven wheels, and these tended to acquire leading and then trailing bogies as guidance of the engine became more of an issue.|$|R
5000|$|NO 4 - Ex-Taupo Totara Timber Co. Mallet No. 7, 2-4-4-2 tender locomotive. Built in 1912 by the American Locomotive Company at Schenectady, New York, GVR NO 4 {{is known}} as the railway's {{flagship}} engine. It is NZ's only <b>Mallet</b> Compound Steam <b>Engine.</b> GVR NO 4 last worked in 2001 and has been stored since, occasionally it is brought out of storage for display at various events, such as its 100th birthday in 2012 when it was displayed in the private siding at Glenbrook.|$|R
