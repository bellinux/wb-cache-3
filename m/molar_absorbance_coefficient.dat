40|$|The {{self-assembly}} {{of several}} pyrene-labelled amphiphilic macromolecules in water {{was characterized by}} fluorescence. Information on their self-assembly was obtained by monitoring the level of pyrene aggregation in solution. A measure {{of the level of}} association was obtained by determining the fraction of aggregated pyrene of the labelled macromolecules from the global analysis of their monomer and excimer fluorescence decays. Global analysis limits the degrees of freedom of the analysis thus reducing the error on the parameters retrieved from the analysis. Extensive developments in the global analysis of the pyrene monomer and excimer decays enabled the first characterization of the <b>molar</b> <b>absorbance</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the pyrene aggregates formed by aqueous solutions of pyrene-labelled poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PyPDMA) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PyPEO). The molar absorbance coefficients of the pyrene aggregates determined for PyPDMA and PyPEO were both found to be broader and red-shifted compared to that of unaggregated pyrene. These results agree with observations found in the scientific literature made by using absorption and excitation fluorescence measurements. Attempts to determine the <b>molar</b> <b>absorbance</b> <b>coefficient</b> of pyrene-labelled hydrophobically-modified alkali-swellable emulsion (PyHASE) polymers were unsuccessful. The inability to characterize the pyrene aggregates of PyHASE was attributed to the greater complexity of the PyHASE polymer compared to PyPDMA and PyPEO. For these simpler pyrene-labelled polymers, a protocol has been established which uses the global analysis of the pyrene monomer and excimer decays to determine quantitatively the level of association of pyrene-labelled polymers as well as the <b>molar</b> <b>absorbance</b> <b>coefficient</b> of their aggregates. Changes in the level of aggregation of pyrene-labelled lipids (PLLs) having head groups bearing an alcohol (PSOH) or imido diacetic acid (PSIDA) embedded in 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleyl- 3 -sn-phosphatidylcholines (POPC) or distearylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) liposomes were probed by fluorescence. Distribution of the PLLs in the fluid POPC membrane was found to be homogeneous while the PLLs phase-separated into amorphous channels created in the DSPC membranes. Multivalent cations Cu 2 + and La 3 + were found to bind to PSIDA, hindering diffusional encounters between unaggregated PSIDA but leaving the PLL aggregates intact. Using the fluorescence quenching ability of Cu 2 +, the viscosity of the amorphous channels of the DSPC membrane was determined to be about six times greater than that of the more fluid POPC membrane. 	Simultaneous rheological and fluorescence measurements were achieved by interfacing a rheometer with time-resolved and steady-state fluorometers using fiber-optic cables. This joint set up enabled the simultaneous rheological and fluorescence measurements of PyHASE solutions having concentrations ranging from 0. 5 w/w% to 5 w/w%. The level of association of the PyHASE solutions was tracked using fluorescence at shear rates of 0, 0. 1 and 100 s– 1. Despite the presence of shear thinning leading to viscosity drops of up to four orders of magnitude, no change in the fluorescence and hence the level of association was observed. The lack of change in level of association implied that the mechanism of shear thinning is due to a switching from inter- to intramolecular association rather than a drop in the level of association. This information will prove useful for future models attempting to predict the rheological behaviour of sheared associative polymers...|$|E

This apparatus was used in previous our study (Kume et al. 2013). The device uses two-wavelength light emitting diodes (750 and 830  nm) as the light source, and measures concentration changes in oxyhemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (Deoxy-Hb), based on the modified Beer-Lambert law. The sum of these variables reflects concentration changes in total hemoglobin (Total-Hb). Measurement values from our device are expressed in grams per liter per centimeter, which was converted from moles per liter per centimeter as a unit of <b>molar</b> <b>absorbance</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The NIRS signals were sampled at 1  Hz. The distance between the light source and the detector in the NIRS probe was 30  mm. The depth of the measured area was {{approximately half of the}} distance between the light source and the detector, i.e., about 1.5  cm (McCully and Hamaoka 2000). Skinfold thickness at the probe site was determined using an ultrasonographic system (SDU- 500; Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) to confirm the measurement area for the NIRS: with skin thicknesses of 5.1  ±  0.9  mm, the light penetration depth was adequate. The probe was firmly positioned at a point one-third of the way from the patella to the greater trochanter (Kime et al. 2009) using double-sided tape and covered with an elastic bandage to minimize movement. NIRS variables during the 5 -min exercise were expressed as delta scores by subtracting the mean values recorded during the first minute of the warm-up exercise with NB (ΔTotal-Hb, ΔOxy-Hb and ΔDeoxy-Hb) (Kume et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{disadvantages}} of organic photochemistry {{is the need for}} high-energy UV light, light that has many detrimental qualities. A viable solution to this problem is the use of upconverting nanoparticles (UCNP) that can locally convert near infrared (NIR) laser light into UV light or visible light of sufficient energy to drive organic photoreactions. In an initial study (Chapter 3), the use of UCNPs to drive both UV and visible light dependent photoreactions with NIR light was demonstrated using 1, 2 -dithienylethene (DTE) molecular switches functioning as probes. In this study the concept of NIR-to-visible ‘remote-control’ photorelease was also introduced. In a second study (Chapter 4), two multicolour UCNPs were developed. It was demonstrated that by only altering the power-density of the one wavelength NIR excitation source, the photochemistry of two DTE molecular switches could be selectively and bi-directionally driven along its two reaction pathways. In a third study (Chapter 5), fluorescence modulation bioimaging was demonstrated in vivo in C. elegans nematodes. The fluorescence modulation in aqueous medium was achieved by decorating the surface of an UCNP with polyethylene glycol functionalized DTE molecular switches by ‘click’ chemistry. In a fourth study (Chapter 6), multimodal fluorescence modulation of a multicolour UCNP by two DTE molecular switches decorated {{on the surface of the}} UCNP was demonstrated. Apart from a greater degree of control in this more advanced system, it is also capable of NIR-to-UV ‘remote-control’ photoswitching. In a fifth study (Chapter 8), the surface of an UCNP was decorated with 3 ’, 5 ’-dialkoxybenzoin photocages and the concept of NIR-to-UV ‘remote-control’ photorelease for potential use in drug-delivery was demonstrated. In a sixth study (Chapter 9), a fully water dispersible drug-delivery system was synthesized. Unfortunately the system proved impractical due to the choice of both photorelease system and therapeutic payload. In a seventh study (Chapter 10), a donor-acceptor 4 -dimethylamino- 3 ’, 5 ’-dimethoxybenzoin photocage with both red-shifted absorbance and a significantly enhanced <b>molar</b> <b>absorbance</b> <b>coefficient</b> was synthesized and its initial and unique photochemistry was studied...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe intermolecular {{interactions}} in mixtures of ionic liquids (ILs) of 1 -alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) amide (CnmimTFSA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) have been elucidated by measurements of refractive indexes, densities, and ATR-IR spectra {{as a function}} of the alky chain length (n = 2 – 12) of Cnmim+ and DMSO molar fraction xDMSO. The excess quantities of refractive indexes and molar volumes showed that in all CnmimTFSA + DMSO systems the packing of IL and DMSO is the loosest around 1 : 3 molar ratio of IL to DMSO. However, the significant alkyl chain dependence was not observed in both quantities. This suggests that the hydrogen bonding of the three imidazolium hydrogen atoms with DMSO molecules mainly contributes to the loose packing. From the ATR-IR spectra measured for CnmimTFSA + DMSO mixtures, the excess <b>molar</b> <b>absorbance</b> in the wavenumber ranges of the imidazolium ring C[sbnd]H vibrations and the S[dbnd]O vibrations of TFSA− anion and DMSO was depicted {{as a function of}} DMSO content. The excess <b>molar</b> <b>absorbance</b> of the C[sbnd]H vibrations revealed that the three imidazolium C 2, 4, 5 [sbnd]H sites, particularly the C 2 [sbnd]H, are progressively hydrogen-bonded with DMSO as the molar fraction increases to xDMSO ≈ 0. 6. The S[dbnd]O vibrations of TFSA− anion suggested that TFSA− anions are eliminated from the imidazolium rings with increasing xDMSO to the same. Hence, TFSA− anions are replaced by DMSO around the imidazolium rings with increasing DMSO content. However, the hydrogen bonding between them is not significantly influenced by the cation's alkyl chain. The partial <b>molar</b> <b>absorbance</b> of the S[dbnd]O vibrations of DMSO showed that DMSO molecules self-aggregate in the mixtures above xDMSO ≈ 0. 6.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{model for}} the steady state behavior of xanthine oxidase is proposed. The model includes 36 species which account for all the possible levels of reduction and binding states for the enzyme. A set of seven intrinsic reactions are modulated by the fraction of available reaction center to provide 160 macroscopic rates between these species. Unlike previous steady-state models, our model includes features known from rapid kinetic experiments such as {{the formation of a}} bound product species and the ability of the enzyme to react three times sequentially with substrate under anaerobic conditions. The complex reoxidation reactions producing either hydrogen peroxide or superoxide radical depending on the overall state of reduction of the enzyme are also accounted for in our model. Measured room temperature mid-point potentials are used to predict the fraction of available reaction center according to the accepted rapid-equilibrium model and literature values for the intrinsic reactions are used when available. We are able to predict product turnover and superoxide turnover for both xanthine and lumazine using our model. The reductive rapid kinetic reaction of xanthine oxidase with lumazine has been proposed to follow a simple three step reaction sequence of substrate binding, bound-product formation and product release. Absorbance changes during the first turnover with lumazine can be simulated using the three step mechanism. <b>Molar</b> <b>absorbances</b> for the intermediates are obtained from the transient kinetics of substoichiometric lumazine with enzyme. The observed <b>molar</b> <b>absorbance</b> at 650 nm for two electron enzyme with violapterin bound is much larger than expected if only Mo(IV) forms the charge transfer band.

The method here proposed has been validated beforehand by applying it to D-mannite and glycerine and by comparing results so obtained with those previously provided by literature. The investigation showed weak acid properties of the -OH of serine and its dissociation constant was determined. Polynuclear species or further dissociation were not observed.

40|$|A new azo dye Schiff base {{analytical}} reagent, namely N, N′-bis(5 -(4 -nitrophenyl) diazenyl) - 2 -hydroxybenzylideneamino) ethylenediimine (NDHBDED) {{has been}} synthesized {{and it was}} impregnated with alumina for extractive determination of metal ions. In this report the solid sorbent matrix {{was used for the}} extraction of Co (II) and Ni (II) ions by pH dependent SPS method. The maximum <b>molar</b> <b>absorbances</b> were at 445 nm and 508 nm at pH 4. 5 and 5. 0 for Co (II) and Ni (II) ions respectively. The Beer’s law range was 5 - 100 μg/ml for both the metal ions. Job’s method and mole-ratio method showed that metal-ligand ratio in the complexes to be 1 : 1. The Molar absorptivity for Co (II) and Ni (II) were 1. 351 x 10 - 4 L mol- 1 cm- 1 and 1. 925 x 10 - 4 L mol- 1 cm- 1 respectively. The Sandell’s sensitivity was 0. 005 µg/ cm 2 and 0. 004 µg/ cm 2 for Co (II) and Ni (II) ions respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of each metal ion in real samples and tap water. ...|$|R
40|$|These {{innovative}} applications {{have led}} to a new dye chemistry. At present, the design of functional fluo-rophores is the most significant and enticing field in dye chemistry (Daehne et al., 1998). There are several requirements for an ideal fluorescent label in biotechnology. First, the fluorophore should be soluble and stable in water because most measurements are performed in aqueous solution. This requirement al-ready excludes the great majority of commercially avail-able organic fluorophores because many of them are not water-soluble, and others decompose in water. Second, labels should possess a reactive group for covalent cou-pling to targets. Third, <b>molar</b> <b>absorbances</b> of potential la-bels should be quite high, because only the photons that are absorbed can be emitted as fluorescent light again. Fourth, labels should exhibit a high emission quantum yield to reduce detection limits of tagged species. Other, more special demands include thermal and photostabili-ty as well as tunable charge of the labels to avoid unde-sired electrostatic attraction between label and target. Until now there has been no single label that fulfills all the requirements described above. Thus the search for optimized fluorophors for bioanalytical application is cur-rently a challenge in chemistry (Czerney and Ehricht...|$|R
40|$|The b 1 protein, {{produced}} in leaves of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi-nc following infection with tobacco mosaic virus, has been purified to homogeneity by a procedure which involves gel chromatography and absorption on to DEAEcellulose. One gel chromatography step was sufficient when {{the procedure was}} applied to leaf extracts made in an acid buffer, whereas two were necessary with extracts made at pH 8. The final product migrates as a single protein band on electrophoresis in both acrylarnide and SDS-acrylamide gels.
