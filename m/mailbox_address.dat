5000|$|Without labels the {{programmer}} {{is required}} to manually calculate mailbox (memory) addresses. In the numeric code example, if a new instruction was to be inserted before the final HLT instruction then that HLT instruction would move from address 07 to address 08 (address labelling starts at address location 00). Suppose the user entered 600 as the first input. The instruction 308 would mean that this value would be stored at address location 08 and overwrite the 000 (HLT) instruction. Since 600 means [...] "branch to <b>mailbox</b> <b>address</b> 00" [...] the program, instead of halting, would get stuck in an endless loop.|$|E

5000|$|The Empty Envelope, {{the fifth}} {{book in the}} series, was written in 1998. Donald David [...] "Dink" [...] Duncan gets several letters in the <b>mailbox</b> <b>addressed</b> to [...] "D. Duncan".... but finds when opening them that they all start with [...] "Dear Doris" [...] and are not meant for him. While his friends Josh Pinto and Ruth Rose Hathaway think it is someone's idea of a joke, Dink {{suspects}} {{that there is more}} to it than that. His suspicions are practically confirmed when Doris Duncan herself shows up one day to acquire the letters and demands them immediately. Not knowing that Ruth Rose's little brother Nate took the letters unaware that they were something important, Dink apologizes to Ms. Duncan, who then leaves in an unpleasant mood. Dink and his friends investigate the letters, uncover a code in the wording, and find a valuable stamp concealed in one of the envelopes hidden under a worthless stamp. Then the owner of the valuable stamp is comes to get it back. Then the two crooks go back to jail. The book is a prequel to The Falcon's Feathers.|$|R

As the song progresses to the line [...] "And this is where I grew up," [...] he walks to a rusty <b>mailbox,</b> <b>addressed</b> as number 29025. As he speaks of sneaking out, the camera does not show the house itself but does show a view from the inside looking out at him, possibly suggesting someone else lives there now. He continues walking and comes to an older building marked as [...] "Hanna High School" [...] on the front (it's now the Community Services Building: 210 6 Avenue East, Hanna, Alberta, Canada) announcing, [...] "And this is where I went to school." [...] He and his three other band members enter the gym with their gear and put on a seemingly impromptu concert alone. During the chorus, two band members go to an old junkyard and reminisce about a field where the rest of the band and their girlfriends are partying. Another experiences a similar event near an abandoned train yard, seeing his old girlfriend (most likely Kim, who was [...] "the first girl I kissed") run near the tracks and kiss his younger self. The Hanna Roundhouse is shown. The camera then switches to flashbacks of various people ("I miss that town, I miss the faces") As the video ends, the flashback people get in their cars to go home as the band finishes the song.|$|R

5000|$|Today, as {{in years}} past, the rural {{delivery}} service uses {{a network of}} rural routes traveled by carriers to deliver and pick up mail to and from roadside <b>mailboxes.</b> Formerly, an <b>address</b> for mail to a rural delivery address included both the rural route number and the box number, for example [...] "RR 5, Box 10." [...] With {{the creation of the}} 911 emergency system, it became necessary to discontinue the old rural route numbers in favor of house numbers and street names as used on city routes. This change enabled emergency services to more quickly locate a rural residence.|$|R
40|$|Mobile IP route {{optimization}} and Mobile IP local registration are {{two approaches}} to solve performance {{problems associated with}} the base Mobile IP protocol proposed by IETF. The route optimization scheme solves the triangular routing problem by introducing the binding cache concept. The local registration scheme reduces the large overhead for location management by processing the mobile host's registration request only at a local foreign agent. In this paper, we present a mailbox-based approach to take advantages of both approaches. Each mobile host migrated to a foreign network is associated with a mailbox, which can be decoupled with the owner host, and packets destined to the receiver will be delivered to the <b>mailbox</b> whose <b>address</b> is cached in the sender. Separating mailbox from its owner host allows us to achieve adaptive location management, {{while at the same time}} buffering incoming packets in the mailbox located somewhere in the network closer to the receiver reduces the retransmission cost. The dynamic migration of mailbox also eliminates the need of pre-structuring mobility agents into hierarchy which is a necessary in the local registration scheme.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{licensing}} models are per single user (named user, client, node) or per user {{in the appropriate}} volume discount level, while some manufacturers accumulate existing licenses. These open volume license programs are typically called open license program (OLP), transactional license program (TLP), volume license program (VLP) etc. and are contrary to the contractual license program (CLP), where the customer commits to purchase {{a certain number of}} licenses over a fixed period (mostly two years). Licensing per concurrent/floating user also occurs, where all users in a network have access to the program, but only a specific number at the same time. Another license model is licensing per dongle which allows the owner of the dongle to use the program on any computer. Licensing per server, CPU or points, regardless the number of users, is common practice as well as site or company licenses. Sometimes one can choose between perpetual (permanent) and annual license. For perpetual licenses one year of maintenance is often required, but maintenance (subscription) renewals are discounted. For annual licenses, there is no renewal; a new license must be purchased after expiration. Licensing can be host/client (or guest), <b>mailbox,</b> IP <b>address,</b> domain etc., depending on how the program is used. Additional users are inter alia licensed per extension pack (e.g. up to 99 users) which includes the base pack (e.g. 5 users). Some programs are modular, so one will have to buy a base product before they can use other modules.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Mobile IP {{is used to}} {{keep track}} of {{location}} information and make the data available to the mobile devices anytime, anywhere. Mobile IP has been widely accepted but lacks in providing seamless handoff. We have proposed a framework for wireless network that uses a flexible and adaptive mailbox-based scheme. In this scheme a mailbox associated with each mobile node while allowing de coupling between them. The FIFO message buffer of mailbox used to store incoming messages destined to a mobile node. Mailbox can be detached from its owner node {{in the sense that the}} mailbox can reside at a location different from the current location of the owner node. During handoff, mailbox of mobile node can itself decide whether it has to move from current mobility agent (home agent or foreign agent) to new mobility agent. A pull technique, MPUL (Message Pull) adopted to implement the message delivery from mailbox to its owner node. The performance tradeoff for various mobility conditions are evaluated using analytical model. Key words: Handoff, mobility agent (home agent or foreign agent), <b>mailbox,</b> care of <b>address</b> (CoA), pull technique, owner nod...|$|R
40|$|Dog bites are {{the third}} {{most common cause of}} {{absenteeism}} among postal workers of the Brazilian National Postal Service in Southern Brazil, with an average off-work time of approximately two days for each biting episode. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the neighborhood characteristics involving dog bites that occurred during work time in postal workers, its impact on work and consequent preventive alternatives. A descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study was designed for all Curitiba postal workers. Data were descriptively analyzed and the hypothesis of correlation between median monthly income, population density and occurrence of dog bites was tested. A total of 34. 9 % of the postal workers answered the questionnaire and 64. 6 % of them had been bitten while working. The odds of bites occurring in a neighborhood increase by 1. 035 times for every increase in one unit in the population density and decrease by 0. 998 times for every increase of US$ 1. 00 in the neighborhood median monthly income of the head of the family. The occurrence of dog bites among postal workers in Curitiba is related to income and population density and prevention strategies should <b>address</b> <b>mailbox</b> position and adequate fencing to provide protection for postal workers...|$|R
