The problem of testing for white noise against <b>multiplicative</b> <b>seasonal</b> ARMA(l,l) -ARMA(l,l) alternatives is investigated. This testing problem is non-standard due to nuisance parameters that appear under the alternative but not under the null hypothesis.

It is shown that the load time series exhibit lasting abrupt changes in the stochastic pattern, termed breaks. The goal is to propose an efficient and robust load forecasting method for prediction up to a day-ahead. To this end, two new robust procedures for outlier identification and suppression are developed. They are termed the multivariate ratio-of-medians-based estimator (RME) and the multivariate minimum-Hellinger-distance-based estimator (MHDE).

40|$|This paper generalizes recent {{proposals}} of density forecasting {{models and}} it develops theory for {{this class of}} models. In density forecasting the density of observations is estimated in regions where the density is not observed.

In this paper the structural assumption is made that the density {{is a product of}} one-dimensional functions. The theory is quite general in assuming the shape of the region where the density is observed. Such models naturally arise when the time point of an observation can be written as the sum of two terms (e. g. onset and incubation period of a disease).

A new smoothing methodology, Double Adaptive Smoothing, is developed. This method is designed to address a complex forecasting model including linear trend and <b>multiplicative</b> <b>seasonal</b> components. The problem of the complex model is handled by separately tracking the errors from each component of the model. These errors are then used to develop smoothing parameters for each component. This study goes on to compare this new adaptive smoothing method with those developed by Trigg/Leach and Whybark. A simulated constant time series and a simulated time series with linear trend and <b>multiplicative</b> <b>seasonal</b> indexes are used for this comparison.

Although the case counts are dwindling at present, given the past history of resurgence of outbreaks despite effective control measures, the control programmes {{have to stay}} prepared. The availability of long time series of monitored/diagnosed malaria cases allows {{for the study of}} forecasting models, with an aim to developing a forecasting system which could assist in the efficient allocation of resources for malaria control. Methods Exponentially weighted moving average models, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models with seasonal components, and <b>seasonal</b> <b>multiplicative</b> autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models were compared on monthly time series of district malaria cases for their ability to predict the number of malaria cases one to four months ahead. The addition of covariates such as the number of malaria cases in neighbouring districts or rainfall were assessed for their ability to improve prediction of selected (seasonal) ARIMA models. Results The best model for forecasting and the forecasting error varied strongly among the districts. The addition of rainfall as a covariate improved prediction of selected (seasonal) ARIMA models modestly in some districts but worsened prediction in other districts. Improvement by adding rainfall was more frequent at larger forecasting horizons. Conclusion Heterogeneity of patterns of malaria in Sri Lanka requires regionally specific prediction models. Prediction error was large at a minimum of 22 % (for one of the districts) for one month ahead predictions. The modest improvement made in short term prediction by adding rainfall as a covariate to these prediction models may not be sufficient to merit investing in a forecasting system for which rainfall data are routinely processed. </p...|$|R
40|$|A Cladophora growth model (CGM) is {{calibrated}} and validated here {{to simulate}} attached and sloughed Cladophora biomass in daily time-steps in an urbanized location of Lake Ontario, using {{two years of}} collected input data and independent measurements of Cladophora biomass. The CGM is used to hindcast Cladophora growth using <b>multiplicative</b> factors of <b>seasonal</b> minimal tissue phosphorus concentrations (Q P) and seasonal mean nearshore light attenuation (Kd PAR) of the early 1970 s and 1980 s relative to modern data. The possible effects of climate on growth are also forecast using additive temperature increases. Cladophora QP in Lake Ontario has declined in parallel with decreasing pelagic P concentrations, resulting in reduced Cladophora biomass at all depths in the euphotic zone. Kd PAR has also declined, most strongly since the mid– 1990 s, following Dreissena mussel invasion, driving an increase in biomass between 3. 5 - and 10 -m depth. Combining these effects, the CGM predicts that biomass along shorelines today is lower in Lake Ontario than in the 1980 s. However, any increases in QP in this post–dreissenid-mussel period will result in greater Cladophora proliferation than in previous decades due to increased nearshore water clarity. Cladophora Q P, while still currently lower than in the early 1980 s, may be rising due to P supply to the littoral zone by the invasive mussels. The surface water temperature of Lake Ontario indicates warming of 0. 96 uC decade 21 from 1980 to 2006. With increasing surface water temperatures, the CGM predicts an earlier spring growth but only a marginal increase in peak Cladophora biomass.

40|$|Cladophora glomerata is the {{dominant}} spring and summer epilithic macroalga in the lower Laurentian Great Lakes, and was a notorious nuisance prior to nutrient management of the early 1970 s. It is an indicator of excessive nutrient supply {{and appears to be}} experiencing a resurgence in the nearshore of the lower Great Lakes. This thesis examines the ecology of C. glomerata in an urbanized location of Lake Ontario and addresses decadal scale environmental changes to the lake and their impact on this macroalga. A Cladophora growth model (CGM) was calibrated and validated to simulate attached and sloughed Cladophora biomass using two years of collected input data and independent measurements of Cladophora biomass. The CGM was used to hindcast Cladophora growth using <b>multiplicative</b> factors of <b>seasonal</b> minimal tissue phosphorus concentrations (QP) and seasonal mean nearshore light attenuation (KdPAR) of the early 1970 s and 1980 s relative to contemporary data. Cladophora QP in Lake Ontario is currently lower than in the early 1980 s, resulting in reduced Cladophora biomass at all depths in the euphotic zone. KdPAR has also declined, most strongly since the mid- 1990 s, following Dreissena mussel invasion, driving an increase in macroalgal biomass between 3. 5 and 10 m depth. Combining these effects, the CGM predicted that biomass is currently lower in Lake Ontario than in the early 1980 s. However, increases in QP in this post-dreissenid mussel period are predicted to result in greater Cladophora proliferation than in previous decades due to increased nearshore water clarity. The in situ rates of primary production on Cladophora-dominated rocky substrata at 1 m depth were measured through the spring and summer. Net primary production (NPP) was measured as change in dissolved inorganic carbon (using IRGA) in benthic incubation chambers flushed continuously with water. Incubations were of 15 - 20 minutes duration, permitting measurements of productivity rates over diurnal and seasonal scales. Maximum biomass-specific net photosynthetic rates (PBmax) were highest in the spring and late-summer/fall (2. 39, 1. 98 mgC gDM- 1 hr- 1, respectively) and decreased to negative rates by early summer (− 0. 76 mgC gDM- 1 hr- 1). Directly measured rates of net primary production were simulated with the CGM. Simulated depth-integrated rates of Cladophora primary production were compared with published depth-integrated measurements of planktonic primary production from Lake Ontario. From the shoreline to the 12 m depth contour, the benthos was estimated to contribute 70 % of the areal primary production. On a seasonal basis, attached macroalgae are {{an important component of the}} energy flux in the Lake Ontario nearshore. This phenology of Cladophora glomerata growing in the western end of Lake Ontario is also described. Based on internal stoichiometric ratios (C:P and N:P), and a positive correlation between the decrease in the biomass-specific maximum photosynthetic rate (PBm) and phosphorus quota (QP), Cladophora productivity at shallow depths was shown to be P limited. In addition, light attenuation through the Cladophora canopy was estimated to be 24. 1 ± 3. 3 (standard deviation) m- 1 using paired light loggers deployed in situ. Acclimation to lower light levels through the Cladophora stand was demonstrated by significantly higher Cladophora chlorophyll concentrations at the base of the canopy. Decreases in Cladophora canopy cover in the summer resulted in increased PBm, even when QP remained near the minimal cell quota, indicating potential co-limitation of Cladophora productivity by light during peak standing crop. Cladophora growing at 1 m depth was also shown here to be tolerant of high irradiance, with an average decline of less than 10 % in Fv/Fm at during peak midday insolation, regardless of nutrient status or ambient water temperature. In conjunction with its role as a seasonally important nearshore primary producer, Cladophora appears to play a role as a seasonal nutrient regulator in the nearshore of Lake Ontario. The nutrient chemistry of nearshore lake water, Cladophora tissue, and a dominant tributary to western Lake Ontario were examined over the growing season of 2 years. As Cladophora grew and assimilated nutrients in the spring, total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations declined in the nearshore. Detachment and sloughing of Cladophora in the late summer was associated with increasing TP in the water column. These changes in nearshore nutrient concentrations were correlated with Cladophora phenology and not catchment loading. Nutrient loading from Oakville Creek was compared with the nutrient uptake of an adjacent Cladophora stand. The TP supply directly from the creek during the growing season was insufficient to meet the concentration of stored P in Cladophora tissue. It appears Cladophora is growing on P regulated by recycling within the lake, supporting the hypothesis that dreissenid mussels are sustaining Cladophora growth through recycling of TP in the lake. Cladophora remains P limited, however, such that increases in catchment loading would further augment its resurgence...|$|R

In the second part, a unified approach for the tentative specification of both the seasonal and nonseasonal orders of general <b>multiplicative</b> <b>seasonal</b> model is proposed. This new approach has the advantages of determining the seasonal and nonseasonal orders simultaneously and automatically. i...|$|E
40|$|Water {{availability}} {{is highly}} influenced by variability of weather parameters. Minimum temperature and relative humidity are important parameters {{that have been}} sidelined in many water resources management projects. In this study, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were identified and diagnosed in order to forecast minimum temperature and relative humidity of the study area. The findings of the study show that minimum temperature was high during dry season, when relative humidity was low. Furthermore, the <b>multiplicative</b> <b>seasonal</b> models best fit minimum temperature and relative humidity represented as ARIMA (5, 1, 0) (2, 0, 0) 12 and ARIMA (1, 0, 0) (2, 0, 0) 12 respectively. While, a ten-year forecast derived from the models would be useful for effective planning and acquisition of water resources projects in the study area...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of stochastic inflation models for actuarial and investment applications {{has become an}} important topic to actuaries since Wilkie [Transactions of the Faculty of Actuaries 39 (1986) 341] introduced his first investment model. Two empirical features of monthly inflation rates are dynamic dependence {{on the level of}} the series and seasonal fluctuations. We propose a model, termed <b>multiplicative</b> <b>seasonal</b> self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SEASETAR), which captures both features simultaneously. The model is a special case of a general non-multiplicative SETAR model. The usefulness of multiplicative SEASETAR models is demonstrated by analyzing five data series of monthly inflation rates. One of these series corresponds to a country with hyperinflation episodes. To get {{a better understanding of the}} basic features underlying the fitted SEASETAR models we also perform a dynamic analysis...|$|E
