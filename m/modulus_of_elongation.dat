The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of time passage on some physical properties such as tensile strength, <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> elasticity, <b>elongation</b> at break, tear strength, hardness, color stability, and contrast ratio (CR) of 2 silicone facial elastomers after being sealed in glass containers and kept in the dark for 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens from 2 silicone elastomers (Silasto 30 and Premium 2) were made and stored in the dark. Tensile and tear strength tests were conducted according to International Organization for Standardization specification nos. 37 and 39, respectively, in a universal testing machine. Shore A hardness was measured according to the American Society for Testing Materials specification D 2240. Color changes (ΔΕ*) were determined in the CIE L*a*b* system using a tristimulus colorimeter, and CR also was calculated. Data were analyzed by paired and unpaired t-tests at a significance level of α = 0. 05. RESULTS: <b>Elongation</b> at break, <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> elasticity, and hardness were significantly changed, whereas changes in CR were observed only in 1 of the 2 elastomers. Tensile and tear strengths were not significantly changed for both of them. Within the limitations of this study, color changes (ΔΕ) were unacceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the physical properties studied were significantly affected because of time passage. Mechanical and physical properties of silicone maxillofacial elastomers can be changed with time passage (natural aging in the dark). The average time of replacing a facial prostheses is 6 to 18 months; thus, it is important that the findings of this study covered a period of 12 months. Time passage seems to be a critical factor contributing to the overall deterioration of a silicone maxillofacial elastomer. Copyright © 2011 Mutaz B. Habal, MD...|$|R

40|$|Plain {{concrete}} {{which is}} strong in compressive strength possesses {{a very low}} tensile strength, limited ductility and little resistance to cracking. Internal micro cracks are inherently present in the concrete due to drying, shrinkage and poor tensile strength, eventually leading to brittle fracture of concrete. Hence fibres are added to concrete to overcome these disadvantages. Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC) is a concrete composite of cement, fine and coarse aggregate and fibres with different proportions. In plain concrete, micro cracks develop even before loading, particularly due to drying, shrinkage or other causes of volume change. The width of these initial cracks seldom exceeds few microns. When loaded the micro cracks propagate and open up, due {{to the effect of}} stress concentration additional cracks form in place of minor defects. Fibres enable concrete to progress from plastic state to hardened state without weakness. This is achieved by the reduction of micro crack formation, reduced segregation and decreasing the scope of capillary formation, thus reducing permeability. Generally, fibres are chosen depending upon the aspect ratio. Out of all types of fibres, steel fibres are mostly used because steel has high <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> elasticity, high <b>elongation,</b> high tensile strength and the bond between steel and the fibre is enormous.

In recent years, there have been increasing requirements for quality and cost effectiveness of manufactured products in all areas of industrial production. These requirements are best met with the polymeric materials, which have many advantages in comparison to traditional materials. The main advantages of polymer materials are especially in their ease of processability, availability, and price of the raw materials. Radiation crosslinking is one of the ways to give the conventional plastics mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties of expensive and highly resistant construction polymers. Several types of ionizing radiation are used for crosslinking of polymers. Each of them has special characteristics. Electron beta and photon gamma radiation are used the most frequently. The great advantage is that the crosslinking occurs after the manufacturing process at normal temperature and pressure. The main purpose of this paper has been to determine the effect of ionizing beta radiation on the tensile <b>modulus,</b> strength and <b>elongation</b> <b>of</b> low and high density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE).

In recent years, substantial progress {{in the understanding of}} transport in terms of drift waves in fusion plasmas has been achieved. It is at present an important issue to investigate the stability of drift waves in realistic toroidal geometries. Among the drift wave candidates for explaining the anomalous transport are the toroidal ITG-modes in the core and the resistive ITG-modes and the resistive ballooning modes in the edge. The effects of plasma shaping on magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) modes have been thoroughly studied. However, the effects of plasma shaping on the drift waves are not well known. Empirically it is found that the overall effects <b>of</b> <b>elongation</b> on the energy confinement time is favorable with ~ kappa^ 0. 5. In this thesis, the ITG-mode and the resistive edge mode stability in a non-circular tokamak geometry are studied. In particular, the effects <b>of</b> <b>elongation</b> and Shafranov shift are studied. In the core plasma a destabilization of the ITG-mode with increasing elongation is found whereas a stabilization is found in the edge region (or rather for peaked density profiles). Moreover, a comparison of the ITG-mode growth rates in the tokamak and stellarator equilibria is made. The growth rates for the tokamak and stellarator cases are comparable whereas the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> the real frequency is substantially larger in the stellarator. In addition, a stronger stabilization of the ITG mode growth is found for large Ln/R in the stellarator case. Finally, an analytical estimation of zonal flow generation including effects <b>of</b> <b>elongation</b> is presented. The results suggest that a strong excitation of zonal flows is obtained for peaked density profiles and close to marginal stability. However, in order draw more detailed conclusions of the effects <b>of</b> <b>elongation</b> on the global confinement time, a more extensive study using predictive transport simulations, which treats the edge and core transport processes self-consistently will be needed...|$|R
