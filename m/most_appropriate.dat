40|$|The {{development}} of an underground station below the water table requires rigorous and careful planning. As such an in depth knowledge of the station construction designs and the related hydraulic behavior are {{required in order to}} design the <b>most</b> <b>appropriated</b> drainage system. Moreover, it is important to ensure the correct drainage of the excavation site to avoid liquefaction and to minimize water seepage. As an example of underground construction we consider the tunnel for the new line in the Barcelona metropolitan area (Línia 9) through the town of Prat de Llobregat in the Llobregat River’s delta, which is currently under development. Most of the tunnel sections are constructed with Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM) and the stations and the ventilation shafts are constructed using “Cut & Cover” technology between sheet pile walls. A typical station on the L 9 line lies partially between the shallow and the main aquifer. Specifically, it is located in the middle layer which in made up of silts and clays. In order to design the <b>most</b> <b>appropriated</b> drainage system we present a methodology whereby we generalize the hydraulic problem. This method enables rapid and efficient estimation of fluxes as well as a general understanding of the problem in a simplified manner. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

5|$|A small {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax will typically resolve without treatment and requires only monitoring. This approach may be <b>most</b> <b>appropriate</b> {{in people who}} have no underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is shortness of breath, the air may be removed with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí also practiced landscaping, {{often in}} urban settings. He aimed to place his {{works in the}} <b>most</b> <b>appropriate</b> natural and {{architectural}} surroundings by studying the location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into those surroundings. For this purpose, he often used the material that was most common in the nearby environment, such as the slate of Bellesguard and the grey Bierzo granite in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the Güell Park and the Can Artigas Gardens, or incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions. Gaudí's harmonious approach to landscaping is exemplified at the First Mystery of the Glory of the Rosary at Montserrat, where the architectural framework is nature itself—here the Montserrat rock—nature encircles the group of sculptures that adorned {{the path to the}} Holy Cave.|$|E

Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in the form of vaccination.

Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the <b>most</b> <b>appropriate</b> system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. A similar approach has also been studied for the United States.|$|E

5|$|These {{powers were}} {{generally}} devolved {{to the prime}} minister and ministers. The matters are political by nature and call for political judgment rather than judicial control. Thus, Parliament is the <b>most</b> <b>appropriate</b> forum for debate and the best qualified to control the executive. However, in practice, parliamentary accountability of ministers is not entirely effective. The prerogative powers that the government officials exercise on behalf of the Crown, coupled with a weak system of checks and balances between the Parliament and the executive, can lead to an abuse of those powers which may be detrimental to the people. The possibility of such abuse, coupled with the way administrative law and judicial review evolved since the 1960s– a period of judicial activism– led courts in the United Kingdom to take an increasing interest {{in the manner in which}} prerogative powers had been exercised.|$|E
