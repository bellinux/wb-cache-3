40|$|A novel <b>MSI</b> <b>circuit</b> and {{reliability}} test method {{has been developed}} to measure the probability of infant failure in InGaP/GaAs HBTs. This circuit enables simultaneous reliability testing of 200 HBTs per circuit, and has been used routinely to test 12, 800 HBTs/wafer (and sometimes 100, 000 HBTs/wafer) to measure the probability of infant failure Pqf on each wafer. We have applied this MSI reliability test method to more than 100 production HBT IC wafers and many experimental wafers. With these tests, we have identified a new HBT failure mode, for which a very small fraction of HBTs (Pqf = 10 - 3 to 10 - 4) fail by beta degradation much sooner than the main HBT population. Moreover, the probability of infant failure Pqf {{is proportional to the}} substrate EPD, with a constant of proportionality approximately equal to the emitter area. This observation is consistent with a model where any HBT whose e-b junction is pierced by a substrate dislocation will suffer beta degradation much sooner than its companions. This data has motivated Agilent to procure substrates with the lowest possible EPD for the manufacture of high complexity HBT ICs with sufficient reliability for use in Agilent instrument products...|$|E

50|$|In 1969, Data General {{introduced}} the Nova and shipped {{a total of}} 50,000 at $8,000 each. The popularity of 16-bit computers, such as the Hewlett-Packard 21xx series and the Data General Nova, led the way toward word lengths that were multiples of the 8-bit byte. The Nova was first to employ medium-scale integration (<b>MSI)</b> <b>circuits</b> from Fairchild Semiconductor, with subsequent models using large-scale integrated (LSI) circuits. Also notable was that the entire central processor was contained on one 15-inch printed circuit board.|$|R

40|$|Most {{contemporary}} introductory {{digital logic}} design laboratories utilize discrete small-scale integrated (SSI), medium-scale integrated (MSI), and programmable logic such as field programmable gate arrays (FGPAs) or complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs). These more complex programmable devices (CPLDs and FPGAs) exhibit a superset of SSI and MSI functionality, enabling instructors to completely eliminate construction of circuits using SSI and MSI chips if they so choose. This paper describes the approach {{taken by the}} authors for introductory digital design laboratories in the Engineering Science Department of Trinity University, and explains {{some of the reasons}} for the given approach. The approach begins with construction of SSI and <b>MSI</b> <b>circuits,</b> includes a bridging laboratory where a complex SSI/MSI circuit is reimplemented in a CPLD, and finally moves to more complex designs utilizing no SSI/MSI constructs.

40|$|InP HBT {{technology}} {{appears to}} offer the high speed, low power and basic producibility necessary to support a high-speed digital IC technology. Maximum clock speed of 53 GHz has been demonstrated at 40 mW per flip-flop (FF) as compared to well over 200 mW/FF for SiGe at slower speeds. At a power dissipation of less than 9 mW/FF, toggle rate is still a respectable 35 GHz. Producibility and high speed at reasonable power levels are what set InP HBT apart from other high-performance technologies. For reasonable levels of total power dissipation on-chip, InP actually supports {{the highest levels of}} integration of ultra-high speed components: 250 equivalent gates for 5 W power dissipation at 50 GHz. In this paper, speed and power of InP HBT are compared to other digital IC technology options such as SiGe HBT and GaAs/AlGaAs HBT, it is shown that InP HBT are ideal for <b>MSI</b> level communications <b>circuits</b> such as multiplexers and demultiplexers. Producibility issues and process latitude are discussed in detail.
