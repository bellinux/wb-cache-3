2500|$|Fisher {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} creating an LED screen on a flexible fabric sheet that could be draped over the stadium seats behind the stage. It was later decided that {{it would be easier to}} build the screen if it was hung in its own frame, so a sloped frame was added to the screen. [...] Several months were spent experimenting with and demonstrating the capabilities of LED video. [...] The screen designed for the show was ten times larger than all 36 Zoo TV screens put together, with a total size that ranged between 150–170feet (46–52metres) wide and 50–56feet (15–17metres) tall, approximately the same size as the backdrop used during the band's Lovetown Tour in 1989. [...] The screen was created with the help of three separate companies, each of whom manufactured different components. [...] The screen contained 150,000 pixels, each of which contained eight separate LEDs of various colors. [...] The pixels were manufactured by SACO Technologies, a Montreal-based company, which specialized in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>control</b> systems and panels for nuclear and hydrogen power stations. [...] U2 was SACO's first client, and prior to the PopMart Tour, the company had no experience with video technology. [...] Each of the pixels were mounted onto 4,500 separate aluminium tubes, which were then broken down into 187 foldable panels, spread across 22 columns, which would easily fit into two trucks.|$|E

5000|$|The {{entire process}} of modular {{construction}} places significance {{on the design}} stage. This is where practices such as Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA) are used to ensure that assembly tolerances are controlled throughout manufacture and assembly on site.

The use of advanced CAD systems, 3D printing and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>control</b> systems are important for modular construction to be successful.

50|$|Critical Quality Attributes (CQA) are chemical, physical, {{biological}} and microbiological attributes {{that can be}} defined, measured, and continually monitored to ensure final product outputs remain within acceptable quality limits. CQA are an essential aspect of a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>control</b> strategy and should be identified in stage 1 of Process Validation: Process design. During this stage acceptable limits, baselines, and data collection and measurement protocols should be established. Data from the design process and data collected during production should be kept by the manufacturer and used to evaluated product quality and process control. Historical data can also help manufacturers better understand operational process and input variables as well as better identify true deviations from quality standards compared to false positives. Should a serious product quality issue arise, historical data would be essential in identifying the sources of errors and implementing corrective measures.|$|E

50|$|In Stage VI, the {{application}} portfolio — tasks like orderly entry, general ledger, and material requirements planning — is completed and its structure “mirrors” {{the organization and}} information flows in the company. During this stage, tracking sales growth becomes an important aspect. On the average, 10% batch and remote job entry, 60% are dedicated to data base and data communications processing, 5% personal computing, 25% minicomputer processing. Management control systems are used the most in Stage VI (40%). There are three aspects of management control; manufacturing, marketing and financial. <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>control</b> demands forecasting — looking down the road for future needs. Marketing control strictly deals with research. Financial control, forecasts cash requirements for the future. Stage VI exercises high control, by compiling {{all of the information}} from Stages I through V. This allows the organization to function at high levels of efficiency and effectiveness.|$|E

50|$|Critical process {{parameters}} (CPP) in {{pharmaceutical manufacturing}} are key variables affecting the production process. CPPs are attributes that are monitored to detect deviations in standardized production operations and product output quality or changes in Critical Quality Attributes. Those attributes {{with a higher}} impact on CQAs should be prioritized and held in a stricter state of control. The manufacturer should conduct test to set acceptable range limits of the determined CPPs and define acceptable process variable variability. Operational conditions within this range are considered acceptable operational standards. Any deviation from the acceptable range will be indicative of issues within {{the process and the}} subsequent production of substandard products. Data relating to CPP should be recorded, stored, and analyzed by the manufacturer. CPP variables and ranges should be reevaluated after careful analysis of historical CPP data. Identifying CPPs is done in stage one of Process Validation: Process design and ???are an essential part of a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>control</b> strategy.|$|E
50|$|Having {{graduated}} with B.Sc and Ph.D degrees from Salford University, Leonard enjoyed {{a career in}} marine diesel industry before joining the University of Manchester (UMIST) in 1971. Here his initial research concerned manufacturing systems, particularly with reference to cellular manufacturing. This work was extended to include computer aided manufacturer, computer aided design, and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>control.</b> This later evolved into computer integrated manufacturing. The resulting publications were contained in a successful submission for the degree of Doctor of Science, D.Sc, in 1987. Later research related to an approach for diminishing Halon gas emissions into the atmosphere, which became widely used to safe ground the ozone layer. The department that Leonard established helped UMIST to gain the Queen’s Anniversary Prize (1998), {{and he was the}} Senior Academic in the presentation party. Over the past 40 years he has given keynote lectures around the world, published in excess of 200 research papers, supervised over 150 research degrees in engineering, science and industrial management and co-authored two academic books.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{suppliers}} {{made the transition}} to COTS components, they also discovered that the hardware market was shrinking fast. COTS not only resulted in lower manufacturing costs for the supplier, but also steadily decreasing prices for the end users, who were also becoming increasingly vocal over what they perceived to be unduly high hardware costs. Some suppliers that were previously stronger in the PLC business, such as Rockwell Automation and Siemens, were able to leverage their expertise in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>control</b> hardware to enter the DCS marketplace with cost effective offerings, while the stability/scalability/reliability and functionality of these emerging systems are still improving. The traditional DCS suppliers introduced new generation DCS System based on the latest Communication and IEC Standards, which resulting in a trend of combining the traditional concepts/functionalities for PLC and DCS into a one for all solution—named [...] "Process Automation System". The gaps among the various systems remain at the areas such as: the database integrity, pre-engineering functionality, system maturity, communication transparency and reliability. While it is expected the cost ratio is relatively the same (the more powerful the systems are, the more expensive they will be), {{the reality of the}} automation business is often operating strategically case by case. The current next evolution step is called Collaborative Process Automation Systems.|$|E
