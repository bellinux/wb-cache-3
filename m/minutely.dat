5|$|The ovary is {{inferior}} (below {{the floral}} parts) and trilocular (three chambered) {{and there is}} a pistil with a <b>minutely</b> three lobed stigma and filiform (thread like) style, which is often exserted (extending beyond the tube).|$|E
5|$|Potter's own three-door oven, her hearthrug, her indoor plants, her {{coronation}} teapot, and {{her water}} pump are <b>minutely</b> detailed with more color {{than in other}} productions. The large format of the original edition, the captions accompanying the full page color illustrations, and the occasional lack of coordination between picture and text all display Potter's delight in the pictures, sometimes {{at the expense of}} the text.|$|E
5|$|The figures, the <b>minutely</b> {{detailed}} clothes, and {{the architecture}} of the room and windows are depicted {{with a high degree of}} realism. Van Eyck's mastery at handling oil can be seen in the differing breadths of brush strokes. The precision of the detail achieved is especially noticeable in the rendering of threads of St. Donatian's blue and golden embroidered cope and mitre, in the weave of the oriental carpet, and in the stubble and veins on van der Paele's aging face.|$|E
5|$|M.lanuginosa {{closely resembles}} M.pilosella, a species {{originally}} described from Netherlands by Maas Geesteranus, and the European species M.zephirus; both {{are in the}} section Fragilipedes. Mycena pilosella differs in several microscopic characteristics: it has densely diverticulate elements of the cap cuticle; long, cylindrical caulocystidia that diverge at a right angle; {{and it does not}} have pleurocystidia. Mycena zephirus is distinct in forming a whitish cap, a stem that is initially <b>minutely</b> hairly but later becomes smooth, radish-like odor, ellipsoid to cylindrical spores, and cheilocystidia with branches near the tip.|$|E
5|$|Once the 342 {{individual}} {{images were}} cleaned of cosmic-ray hits and corrected for scattered light, {{they had to}} be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called 'drizzling', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied <b>minutely</b> between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 arcseconds across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} finetooth shark is {{slender and}} streamlined. The snout is long and pointed, with the nares preceded by short, broadly {{triangular}} flaps of skin. The eyes are large and round, with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The mouth is broad with well-defined furrows at the corners. Twelve to 15 tooth rows occur {{on either side of}} the upper jaw and 1314 tooth rows {{on either side of the}} lower jaw. Each tooth is small and needle-like, with a narrow central cusp and smooth to <b>minutely</b> serrated edges. The five pairs of gill slits are long, measuring about half the length of the dorsal fin base.|$|E
5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are <b>minutely</b> detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented as a highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on a bed of flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is composed in monochrome, muted colours; predominately blacks, greys and browns. The exceptions are {{the whites of}} his collar and sleeves, the reds in the cushion and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm-chair. In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome. Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly staring at the viewer {{in a manner that}} is both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak, his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty. Influenced by Nicolas Poussin's 1650 Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting, Ingres <b>minutely</b> details the veins and wrinkles of his face. Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a gold–brown background lit from the right. He rests on a curved-back mahogany chair, the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space.|$|E
5|$|The {{pavilion}} is rectangular in shape, {{situated in}} the west of Sheesh Mahal, and is prominent because of its centrally arched and extraordinarily curved roof. This unique feature is symbolic of Shajahani architecture. It reflects a mixture of contemporary traditions (at {{the time of its}} construction) of sloping-roof from Bengal, and Baldachin from Europe. This demonstrates the imperial as well as religious image of the subject. The original roof was probably gilded. The inner walls are <b>minutely</b> inlaid with precious and semi-precious stones and silver with delicate parchin kari ornamentation are considered among the finest in the world.Glazed tile mosaics have been used to decorate the spandrels of the arched openings with floral designs and images of angels, genies, and solomonic symbols. The marble screens of the pavilion are crowned with merlons to prevent inmates being seen from the grounds in between the Fort and the river. The overall quadrangle comprises private quarters for royal family and closely resembles Agra fort.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are <b>minutely</b> detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the reticulate whipray is diamond-shaped and wider than long, with the leading margins almost straight and the snout and outer corners angular. In juveniles, the disc {{is about as}} wide as long, with a more obtuse snout and rounded corners. The eyes are small and immediately followed by the spiracles (paired respiratory openings). A short and wide curtain of skin with a <b>minutely</b> fringed rear margin is present between the long, thin nostrils. The mouth is relatively small, with a deep concavity {{at the center of}} the lower jaw and shallow furrows at the corners extending onto the lower jaw. A row of 4–5 papillae (nipple-like structures) is found across the floor of the mouth. There are 26–40 upper tooth rows and 27–44 lower tooth rows. The pelvic fins are small and triangular. The tail is whip-like and extremely thin, measuring 3–3.5 times as long as the disc when intact, and lacks fin folds. Usually one serrated stinging spine is located on the upper surface on the tail, some distance from the base.|$|E
25|$|Barier, {{who had a}} <b>minutely</b> {{detailed}} style, {{was much}} inferior as an artist.|$|E
25|$|The many {{existing}} {{remains of}} viae publicae. These are often sufficiently well preserved {{to show that}} the rules of construction were, as far as local material allowed, <b>minutely</b> adhered to in practice.|$|E
25|$|The housing environment: Les Saintes {{is renowned}} for the charm and the {{cleanliness}} of its houses. Everything is <b>minutely</b> detailed: railings, doors with flaps, venetian blinds, the designs, and the decorative friezes covering gutters along the roof. Wood {{is still the}} most important material of local crafts.|$|E
25|$|The Nevada {{commission}} secretary {{pointed out}} that unlike other states Nevada distinguished between gamblers, who were legal and licensed, and racketeers, who were not. He said both Levinson and Clarke, licensed in the Sands Hotel, had gambling backgrounds which were studied <b>minutely</b> before they were granted casino permits.|$|E
25|$|The radula {{is used by}} {{molluscs}} {{for feeding}} and is sometimes compared rather inaccurately to a tongue. It is a <b>minutely</b> toothed, chitinous ribbon, typically used for scraping or cutting food before the food enters the oesophagus. The radula is unique to molluscs, and is found in every class of mollusc apart from bivalves.|$|E
25|$|In {{the center}} foreground, the {{fountain}} of life consists of a large stream of water, ending with a jewel-laden bed. In the distance, a <b>minutely</b> detailed cityscape recalls New Jerusalem. The detail and close attention to landscape and nature is at a level previously unseen in Northern European art. The numerous recognisable species of plants are <b>minutely</b> depicted {{with high levels of}} botanical accuracy. Similarly, the clouds and rock formations in the distance contain degrees of verisimilitude that evince studied observation. The far landscape contains representations of actual churches, while the depiction of the mountains beyond contain the first known example in art of aerial perspective. Yet the panel does not strive for exact realism; the sum of the forensically detailed natural elements, in combination with the apparition of the Holy Spirit and extended beams of light, serve to create a wholly individual and uniquely creative interpretation of a classic biblical scene.|$|E
25|$|The {{inferior}} ovary is three-celled. The {{style is}} slender and {{longer than the}} anthers, the stigma are <b>minutely</b> capitate. The ovary ripens into a three-celled capsule fruit. This fruit is fleshy, ellipsoid or almost spherical opening by three flaps with seeds that are light brown to white and oblong with a small appendage or tail (elaiosome) containing substances attractive to ants, which distribute the seeds.|$|E
25|$|On {{top of the}} {{pendulum}} is a small stack of old penny coins; these are to adjust {{the time of the}} clock. Adding a coin has the effect of <b>minutely</b> lifting the position of {{the pendulum}}'s centre of mass, reducing the effective length of the pendulum rod and hence increasing {{the rate at which the}} pendulum swings. Adding or removing a penny will change the clock's speed by 0.4 seconds per day.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} turbinate in shape, thin, {{translucent}} and shining. It is a yellowish horn color at the apex, white or greenish white below the apex. The shell has four whorls which are convex, regularly increasing, <b>minutely</b> striate, the uppermost shouldered, with a single, well-marked carina which becomes obsolete {{on the body}} whorl. Turbinate shell form and an incipient carina (keel-shaped ridge) on the dorsal surface of the shell distinguishes Valvata utahensis from the morphologically similar Valvata humeralis.|$|E
25|$|A popular form of {{textile art}} in Japan is shibori (intricate tie dye), found {{on some of}} the more {{expensive}} kimonos and haori kimono jackets. Patterns are created by <b>minutely</b> binding the fabric and masking off areas, then dying it, usually by hand. When the bindings are removed, an undyed pattern is revealed. Shibori work can be further enhanced with yuzen (hand applied) drawing or painting with textile dyes or with embroidery; it is then known as tsujigahana. Shibori textiles are very time-consuming to produce and require great skill, so the textiles and garments created from them are very expensive and highly prized.|$|E
25|$|The common {{materials}} of writing were the tablet and the roll, the former probably having a Chaldean origin, the latter an Egyptian. The tablets of the Chaldeans {{are among the}} most remarkable of their remains. There are small pieces of clay, somewhat rudely shaped into a form resembling a pillow, and thickly inscribed with cuneiform characters. Similar use has been seen in hollow cylinders, or prisms of six or eight sides, formed of fine terra cotta, sometimes glazed, on which the characters were traced with a small stylus, in some specimens so <b>minutely</b> as to be capable of decipherment only {{with the aid of a}} magnifying-glass.|$|E
25|$|Though the reputations of many {{of these}} writers had faded by the mid-20th century, the {{influence}} of the symbolist movement was nonetheless profound. This was especially true in the case of Innokenty Annensky, whose definitive collection of verse, Cypress Box, was published posthumously (1909). Sometimes cited as a Slavic counterpart to the accursed poets, Annensky managed to render into Russian the essential intonations of Baudelaire and Verlaine, while the subtle music, ominous allusions, arcane vocabulary, and the spell of <b>minutely</b> changing colours and odours in his poetry were all his own. His influence on the acmeist school of Russian poetry (Akhmatova, Gumilyov, Mandelshtam) was paramount.|$|E
25|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} and {{powerful}} Anglo-Irish Protestant landowning family, {{he entered the}} House of Commons in 1875. He was a land reform agitator, and became leader of the Home Rule League in 1880, insisting on operating independently of the Liberals, and winning great influence by his balancing of constitutional, radical, and economic issues, and by his skillful use of parliamentary procedure. He was imprisoned in Kilmainham Gaol in 1882 but, a very capable negotiator, was released when he renounced violent extra-Parliamentary action. That same year he reformed the Home Rule League as the Irish Parliamentary Party, which he controlled <b>minutely</b> as Britain's first disciplined democratic party.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Mime {{are gifted}} {{with the art}} of miming at a young age, but as they mature, they gain {{the ability to make}} {{invisible}} objects by emitting energy from their fingers and <b>minutely</b> vibrating their fingertips to harden the air around them and form a wall. Barriers generated this way can repel harsh attacks, and its gestures and motions can convince watchers that something unseeable actually exists; once this is achieved, the perceived item will materialize. Mr. Mime are very prideful of their pantomime acts, and will heavily slap anyone that interrupts them while miming. Mr. Mime has a pre-evolution, Mime Jr., which evolves when mimicking other Pokémon.|$|E
25|$|Fired clay or {{terracotta}} {{was also}} widely {{employed in the}} Roman period for architectural purposes, as structural bricks and tiles, and occasionally as architectural decoration, and for the manufacture of small statuettes and lamps. These are not normally classified under the heading 'pottery' by archaeologists, but the terracottas and lamps {{will be included in}} this article. Pottery is a key material in the dating and interpretation of archaeological sites from the Neolithic period onwards, and has been <b>minutely</b> studied by archaeologists for generations. In the Roman period, ceramics were produced and used in enormous quantities, and the literature on the subject, in numerous languages, is very extensive.|$|E
25|$|Willis was {{the first}} to number the cranial nerves in the order in which they are now usually {{enumerated}} by anatomists. He noted the parallel lines of the mesolobe (corpus callosum), afterwards <b>minutely</b> described by Félix Vicq-d'Azyr. He seems to have recognised the communication of the convoluted surface of the brain and that between the lateral cavities beneath the fornix. He described the corpora striata and optic thalami; the four orbicular eminences, with the bridge, which he first named annular protuberance; and the white mammillary eminences, behind the infundibulum. In the cerebellum he remarks the arborescent arrangement of the white and grey matter and gives a good account of the internal carotids and the communications which they make with the branches of the basilar artery.|$|E
25|$|Digestive system: The {{mouth is}} a minute {{transverse}} slit {{in the front}} of the cephalic disc. The jawss are large, but imperfectly cornified. The jaws are angular and <b>minutely,</b> irregularly serrate. They are composed of numerous minute prismatic rods. On the margin many of these rods are transverse and project slightly, forming a minute serration. The radular sack is small. The radula has the formula 12.1.1.1.12. The central tooth is a simple flat triangular plate. The single lateral tooth is well differentiated from the marginal teeth, from which it is separated by a considerable space, and points in the opposite direction. The marginal teeth are slender, elongate, curved rod-like bodies somewhat expanded at the base. They decrease in size gradually from the second or third marginal, which is slightly larger than the first, outwards.|$|E
25|$|Study of the {{unconscious}} mind, {{a part of the}} psyche outside the awareness of the individual which nevertheless influenced thoughts and behavior was a hallmark of early psychology. In one of the first psychology experiments conducted in the United States, C. S. Peirce and Joseph Jastrow found in 1884 that subjects could choose the <b>minutely</b> heavier of two weights even if consciously uncertain of the difference. Freud popularized this concept, with terms like Freudian slip entering popular culture, to mean an uncensored intrusion of unconscious thought into one's speech and action. His 1901 text The Psychopathology of Everyday Life catalogues hundreds of everyday events which Freud explains in terms of unconscious influence. Pierre Janet advanced the idea of a subconscious mind, which could contain autonomous mental elements unavailable to the scrutiny of the subject.|$|E
25|$|Upperside of {{both sexes}} brown of varying depths of colour. Forewing: cell with one pair of subbasal and one pair of apical {{transverse}} sinuous fasciae, the outermost defining the discocellulars; a short, broad, dark, oblique fascia beyond to vein 4, its inner margin diffuse, its outer sinuous but sharply defined; below vein 4 a sinuous, transverse, more faint fascia, followed by a discal blackish fascia, very broad and diffuse, below costa, bordered by a row of faint ocelli, and a postdiscal and a subterminal similar fascia following {{the outline of the}} termen. Hindwing with a slender blackish loop near apex of cellular area; a broad inwardly diffuse, outwardly well-defined short discal fascia in continuation of the one on the forewing; a series of postdiscal somewhat ochraceous ocelli with black pupils <b>minutely</b> centred with white; postdiscal and subterminal broad lines as on the forewing.|$|E
25|$|Wood-carving {{examples}} of the first eleven centuries of AD are extremely rare. The carved panels of the main doors of St Sabina on the Aventine Hill, Rome, are very interesting specimens of early Christian relief sculpture in wood, dating, as the dresses show, from the 5th century. The doors {{are made up of}} a large number of small square panels, each <b>minutely</b> carved with a scene from the Old or New Testament. A very fine fragment of Byzantine art (11th or 12th centuries) is preserved in a monastery at Mount Athos in Macedonia. It consists of two panels (one above the other) of relief sculpture, surmounted by a semicircular arch of conventional foliage springing from columns ornamented with animals in foliage of spiral form. The capitals and bases are square, each face being carved with a figure. It is a wonderfully fine piece of work, conceived in the best decorative spirit.|$|E
25|$|The largetooth cookiecutter shark has a long, cigar-shaped {{body with}} an {{extremely}} short, blunt head and snout. The large, oval eyes are positioned to allow binocular vision, and {{are followed by}} wide, angled spiracles. The nostrils are small, each with a low, pointed skin lobe in front. The mouth is transverse, with a deep fold enclosing its corners and fleshy suctorial lips. The jaws are larger and more powerful than those of I. brasiliensis, and contain fewer tooth rows, numbering around 29 in the upper jaw and 19 in the lower jaw. The upper teeth are small, narrow, and smooth-edged, upright {{at the center of}} the jaw and becoming more angled towards the corners. The lower teeth are massive, the largest teeth relative to body size of any living shark. They are triangular in shape, with <b>minutely</b> serrated edges and interlocking rectangular bases. The five pairs of gill slits are minute.|$|E
25|$|Close {{examination}} of affected features {{show that the}} doubling is extremely irregular. This is because the coin metal does not flow from just one direction, but flows and produces wear on the die from all sides. There is no definite shape, and it can take on several different but similar appearances. It often looks like a thin metal shelf or spreading spot. It can also make lettering appear thick and twisted. There are no crisp lines affected, but things generally look bloated, enlarged, blurry, twisted, and damaged. This is different from hub doubling, because hub doubling appears as a crisp secondary image, rotated <b>minutely</b> from the original. When casually glancing at a coin, the difference {{is not easy to}} tell, but when magnified, the difference is obvious on most coins. Another easy way to tell hub doubling from die deterioration doubling is the presence of notched serifs; the small flairs on the ends of letters will appear distinctly separated with the former, whereas they appear just blurry and washed out with the latter.|$|E
25|$|Male upperside: {{somewhat}} {{more than half}} the forewing from base velvety black, apical half dull fuliginous; cell-area with or without two short transverse orange bars; a blue patch above, the tornus; the outer margin of the basal black area obliquely zigzag in a line from the middle of costa to apex of vein 2, including a large discal, generally obscure ocellus, which, however, in some specimens is prominently ringed with orange yellow. Beyond this a broad white irregularly oblique discal band followed by a short oblique preapical bar from costa; a small black orange-ringed ocellus beneath the bar, a subterminal continuous line of white spots in the interspaces and a terminal jet-black slender line; cilia alternately dusky black and white. Hindwing blue shaded with velvety black towards base; a postdiscal black white-centred orange and black-ringed ocellus in interspace 2, a round <b>minutely</b> white-centred velvety-black spot (sometimes entirely absent) in interspace 5; the termen narrowly white, traversed by an inner and an outer subterminal and a terminal black line; cilia white.|$|E
25|$|The {{great success}} of Reese on Play (an {{outstanding}} guide to dummy play and defence) {{was followed by}} an even more ambitious work. The Expert Game was the book which really made his name. As the title suggests, it dealt with card play at the highest level, including some ideas that were novel at the time, for instance, inferences from events that did not occur, and the principle of restricted choice. Examples of bridge logic abound in Reese, for instance, a player who overcalls but does not lead his suit is likely to lack one or two key honours; this concept is often called 'the dog that did not bark in the night' (after Sherlock Holmes in Arthur Conan Doyle's Silver Blaze). Another form of logic {{can be seen in}} 'If it must be so, assume it is so'. His examples of counting (and other ways of drawing inferences from the bidding and play) spread such ideas from a coterie of masters in London (or New York) to a much wider group of nascent experts. For at least twenty years after this book was published, one could be sure that virtually every top-class player had studied it <b>minutely.</b>|$|E
25|$|For his self-defence, Socrates first {{eliminates}} {{any claim}} {{that he is a}} wise man. He says that Chaerephon, reputed to be impetuous, went to the Oracle of Delphi and asked her, the Pythia, to tell him of anyone who was wiser than Socrates. The Pythia answered to Chaerephon that there was no man wiser. On learning of that oracular pronouncement, Socrates says he was astounded, because, on the one hand, it is against the nature of the Oracle to lie, but, on the other hand, he knew he was not wise. Therefore, Socrates sought to find someone wiser than himself, so that he could take that person as evidence to the Oracle at Delphi. Hence why Socrates <b>minutely</b> queried everyone who appeared to be a wise person. In that vein, he tested the minds of politicians, poets, and scholars, for wisdom; although he occasionally found genius, Socrates found no one who possessed wisdom; yet, each man was thought wise by the people, and each man thought himself wise; therefore, he (Socrates) was the better man, because he was aware that he was not wise.|$|E
