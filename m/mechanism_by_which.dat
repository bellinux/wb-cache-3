5|$|Mutations in lamin genes {{leading to}} defects in {{filament}} assembly cause {{a group of}} rare genetic disorders known as laminopathies.

5|$|The <b>mechanism</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> a polyubiquitinated {{protein is}} {{targeted}} to the proteasome {{is not fully}} understood. Ubiquitin-receptor proteins have an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and one or more ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. The UBL domains are recognized by the 19S proteasome caps and the UBA domains bind ubiquitin via three-helix bundles. These receptor proteins may escort polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome, though the specifics of this interaction and its regulation are unclear.|$|E

5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, {{a number of}} risk factors {{for the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The <b>mechanism</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|As {{coenzyme}} Q {{is reduced}} to ubiquinol {{on the inner side}} of the membrane and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other, a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step <b>mechanism</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> this occurs is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c, the efficiency would be halved, with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced.|$|E

Possible explanations include headward erosion or a broken natural dam of a lake or river.

The much larger drainage area and yet steeper stream gradient helped to further accelerate downcutting.|$|E

Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E

By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett deposition or a combination of Langmuir-Blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer.

30|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} and isolate CSCs in various tumor models has now {{led to the emergence}} of studies that are beginning to understand the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> CSCs can contribute to tumor initiation as well as continued tumor progression. In some cases, CSCs appear capable of driving tumor population expansion and relapse following treatment through chemoresistance. While the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> CSCs can escape chemotherapy treatment appear to be diverse, our studies suggest that these mechanisms may be influenced by specific oncogenes that are integral to a tumor’s initiation and subsequent growth [18]. In this review, we will discuss some of the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> CSCs can escape chemotherapy as well as the clinical implications of these studies. Understanding the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> CSCs can contribute to chemotherapy and tumor relapse is important as it provides important clues to better addressing cancer therapy and more specifically, cancer therapy that accounts for the unique biology of CSCs.|$|R

5|$|Proteasomes {{are part}} of a major <b>mechanism</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> cells {{regulate}} the concentration of particular proteins and degrade misfolded proteins. Proteins are tagged for degradation with a small protein called ubiquitin. The tagging reaction is catalyzed by enzymes called ubiquitin ligases. Once a protein is tagged with a single ubiquitin molecule, this is a signal to other ligases to attach additional ubiquitin molecules. The result is a polyubiquitin chain that is bound by the proteasome, allowing it to degrade the tagged protein. The degradation process yields peptides of about seven to eight amino acids long, which can then be further degraded into shorter amino acid sequences and used in synthesizing new proteins.|$|E

The exact <b>mechanism</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|E
5|$|The acute oral {{toxicity}} for chromium(VI) ranges between 50 and 150µg/kg. In the body, chromium(VI) {{is reduced}} by several mechanisms to chromium(III) already in the blood before it enters the cells. The chromium(III) is excreted from the body, whereas the chromate ion is transferred into the cell by a transport <b>mechanism,</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> also sulfate and phosphate ions enter the cell. The acute toxicity of chromium(VI) is due to its strong oxidational properties. After it reaches the blood stream, it damages the kidneys, the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions.
