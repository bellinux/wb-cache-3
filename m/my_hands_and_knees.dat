500|$|Thomas O'Leary, the {{wireless}} operator for ML 446, recalled {{the ferocity of}} incoming German fire, stating"One commando was remarking how pretty the tracer fire, red and green, was. A moment later one blew {{the back of his}} head out. I was down below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) and out the other side. If I wanted to get about I had to crawl on <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> and I was lucky nothing came through at my level. We couldn't get in (to the objective) and all over a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire."ML 177, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. [...] ML 269, another torpedo-armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E
2500|$|On July 12, 2012, Tyler {{announced}} that he would be leaving American Idol after two seasons, with a statement saying, [...] "After some long... hard... thoughts... I've decided it's time for me to let go of my mistress 'American Idol' before she boils my rabbit. I strayed from my first love, AEROSMITH, and I’m back— but instead of begging on <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> I got two fists in the air and I’m kicking the door open with my band. The next few years are going to be dedicated to kicking some serious ass— the ultimate in auditory takeover..." [...] However, the reports suggest that Tyler was dumped by the American Idol bosses. Tyler has since indicated that his troubles with his bandmates were the primary reason he signed up to do American Idol. He was replaced by Keith Urban.|$|E
60|$|Then I got down, on <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> {{and went}} on another {{exploring}} expedition.|$|E
60|$|I removed four bricks to make footholes in {{different}} positions up the wall. It was desperately hard and long work, {{easy as it}} may sound in description--especially when I had to hold on by the top of the wall, with my flat opera hat (as we used to call it in those days) laid, as a guard, between <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> the glass, while I cleared a way through the sharp bottle-ends for <b>my</b> other <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees.</b> This done, my great difficulty was vanquished; and I had only to drop luxuriously into a flower-bed {{on the other side of}} the wall.|$|R
60|$|Appalled by that terrific spectacle, {{which seemed}} more {{appropriate}} to the terrors of the Pit than to this earth of ours, and fearful lest the blast should whirl me like a dead leaf into the glowing gulf beneath, I fell on to <b>my</b> sound <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> shouting to Leo to do likewise, and looked about me. Now I observed lines of priests wrapped in great capes, kneeling upon {{the face of the}} rock and engaged apparently in prayer, but of Hes the Mother, or of Atene, or of the corpse of the dead Khan I could see nothing.|$|R
60|$|Some huge thing hurtled {{against us}} in the darkness, rearing, stamping, smashing, springing, snorting. The table was splintered. We were {{scattered}} in every direction. It clattered and scrambled amongst us, rushing with horrible energy from {{one corner of the}} room to another. We were all screaming with fear, grovelling upon our <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> to get away from it. Something trod upon <b>my</b> left <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> I felt the bones splinter under the weight.|$|R
60|$|I peered keenly {{into the}} blackness. At length I reached the slope. Here I dropped to <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|E
60|$|Elsie shrank {{back against}} the wall of rock. I {{advanced}} on <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> {{to the edge of the}} precipice. It was not quite sheer, but it dropped like a sea-cliff, with broken ledges.|$|E
60|$|The October night comes down; {{returning}} {{as before}} Except for a slight sensation of being {{ill at ease}} I mount the stairs and turn {{the handle of the}} door And feel as if I had mounted on <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>Knees</b> 3/4 {{turnover}} [...] - [...] Bouncing on <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> then {{making a}} forward rotation {{to land in}} either Back Drop, to your feet or Seat Drop.|$|R
60|$|And then Ustane crept {{past her}} on her <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> went.|$|R
5000|$|Psalm 22:16 -- [...] "they have pierced <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet" [...] {{instead of}} [...] "like a lion, (they are at) <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{went down}} on <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> to look for him, for I felt very curious to know how young Frogs ought to be amused. After a minute's search, I found him sitting {{at the edge of}} the ditch, by the side of the little Frog, and looking rather disconsolate.|$|E
6000|$|I {{went down}} on <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> and {{threaded}} {{my way through the}} long grasses and matted boughs as noiselessly as I could. The two old hands watched me. When I emerged several yards off, much to their surprise, Colebrook turned to Doolittle. [...] "Might answer," [...] he said curtly. [...] "Major says, 'Choose your own men.' Anyhow, if they catch him, nobody's fault but his. Wants to go. Will do it." ...|$|E
60|$|I crept on <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> to the box, to {{see what}} queer thing had found {{his way to the}} crackers, and peeped {{cautiously}} over the edge. There were Killooleet, and Mrs. Killooleet, and the five little Killooleets, just seven hopping brown backs and bobbing heads, helping themselves to the crackers. And the sound of their bills on the empty box made the jolliest tattoo that ever came out of a camping kit.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then let us find it," [...] {{replied the}} Wizard, {{and so all}} got down on their <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> began {{examining}} the scattered pieces.|$|R
2500|$|Graham Davis: You {{got down}} on your <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> at his home? ...|$|R
5000|$|Spending {{a school}} day {{crawling}} on <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> (earns a toy shoe) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{the woman}} remain. Remove the man. Go." [...] Thus spoke Issus, {{and the heavy}} hand of the officer fell upon my shoulder. In {{accordance}} with his instructions I dropped to <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> once more and crawled from the Presence. It had been my first audience with deity, but I am free to confess that I was not greatly impressed--other than with the ridiculous figure I cut scrambling about on my marrow bones.|$|E
6000|$|Propped on <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> {{fearful that}} Mrs Bowater might {{interrupt}} me before I was prepared, I stared fixedly at the newspaper. I understood {{all that it}} said, yet it was as strange {{to me as if}} it had been written in Hebrew. I had seen, I had known, Mr Crimble. Who, then, was this? My throat drew together as I turned my head a little and managed to inquire, [...] "What is an inquest, Mrs Bowater?" ...|$|E
60|$|Just as I {{had made}} it tight and fixed it in a {{comfortable}} place, I thought I heard a sound of breathing outside the door. The chill feeling of horror ran through me again as I listened. No! dead silence still in the passage--I had only heard the night air blowing softly into the room. The next moment I was on the window-sill--and the next I had {{a firm grip on}} the water-pipe with <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|E
60|$|I stopped, on <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> for we {{had come}} to the bushes.|$|R
60|$|Again {{the detective}} {{dropped to his}} <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> Jet {{following}} his example.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll pick 'em up, ma'am," [...] cried Kitty, {{who loved}} to be useful; and down she went on her <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> {{carefully}} picked up every runaway.|$|R
6000|$|Guy and Viola {{were two}} bright fountains of childish, quaint {{thoughts}} and speeches. I found a ready sale {{for this kind}} of humor, and was furnishing a regular department in a magazine with [...] "Funny Fancies of Childhood." [...] I began to stalk them as an Indian stalks the antelope. I would hide behind sofas and doors, or crawl on <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> among the bushes in the yard to eavesdrop while they were at play. I had all the qualities of a harpy except remorse.|$|E
60|$|I {{crept into}} the narrow passage, which was so low that I had to crawl down it upon <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> Craning my neck round, I could see the black angular {{silhouette}} of my companion as he came after me. He paused at the entrance, and then, with a rustling of branches and snapping of twigs, the faint light was suddenly shut off from outside, and we were left in pitchy darkness. I heard the scraping of his knees as he crawled up behind me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{felt that}} I had better move, so, taking up my pistol and hiding it, I crawled on <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> {{to the spot}} where I had hidden this book; and then got up on to my feet, and {{staggered}} across the plain, as if sorely wounded, and scarcely able to drag my feet along. As I had hoped, no one seemed to notice me, and I saw three or four other figures, also making their way painfully towards where the Dervishes had encamped.|$|E
60|$|Harvey {{opened the}} door softly, dropped to his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> crawled into the yard.|$|R
2500|$|... body rocking, {{where the}} whole body is moved while on the <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|R
60|$|Dismounting, he {{got down}} upon his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> {{examined}} the last hoof-prints with extreme care.|$|R
6000|$|To make {{assurance}} surer, I got upon <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> and crawled, {{without a}} sound, towards {{the corner of}} the house. As I drew nearer, my heart was suddenly and greatly lightened. It is not a pleasant noise in itself, and I have often complained of it at other times, but just then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and peaceful in their sleep. The sea-cry of the watch, that beautiful [...] "All's well," [...] never fell more reassuringly on my ear.|$|E
60|$|It {{struck me}} that the air might be better nearer the floor, and I proved it when I dropped on <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> I rolled Uchino out of his {{blankets}} with a quick jerk, wrapped the blankets about my head, face, and mouth, arose to my feet, and dashed for'ard into the hall. After a couple of collisions with the wood-work I again {{dropped to the floor}} and rearranged the blankets so that, while my mouth remained covered, I could draw or withdraw, a thickness across my eyes.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me, {{as far as}} I could recollect, {{there was only a}} chair here and there and yonder, five or six of them {{scattered}} over this territory, and I thought maybe after I found that chair I might find the next one. Well, I did. And I found another and another and another. I kept going around on <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> having those sudden collisions, and finally when I banged into another chair I almost lost my temper. And I raised up, garbed as I was, not for public exhibition, right {{in front of a mirror}} fifteen or sixteen feet high.|$|E
60|$|Then Otter rose {{upon his}} <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> his face looked fierce in the faint light.|$|R
60|$|Our lively {{interpreter}} {{went down}} on <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> made an earnest examination, despite the squirting water.|$|R
60|$|With {{great care}} they {{got down on}} their <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> {{examined}} the opening beyond the rocks.|$|R
