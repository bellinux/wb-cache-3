5000|$|Generally, commands, {{beliefs and}} {{sentences}} about probabilities aren't judged as true or false. [...] "Inhale and exhale" [...] {{is therefore not}} a statement in logic {{because it is a}} command and cannot be true or false, although a person can obey or refuse that command. [...] "I believe I can fly or I can't fly" [...] isn't taken as a statement of truth or falsity, because beliefs don't say anything about the truth or falsity of the parts of the entire [...] "and" [...] or [...] "or" [...] statement and therefore the entire [...] "and" [...] or [...] "or" [...] statement. A possible world is a possible situation. In every case, a possible world is contrasted with an actual situation. Earth one <b>minute</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> is a [...] "possible world". Earth as it is actually [...] also a [...] "possible world". Hence the oddity of and controversy in contrasting a [...] "possible" [...] world with an [...] "actual" [...] world (Earth is necessarily possible). In logic, [...] "worlds" [...] are described as a non-empty set, where the set could consist of anything, depending on what the statement says.|$|R

Do not be afraid. I will not rush at him like a bully, or bear him down with any brute superiority. I will fight him like a gentleman; I will fight him as our fathers fought. He shall choose how, sword or pistol, horse or foot. But if he refuses, I will write his cowardice on every wall in the world. If he had said of my mother what he said of the Mother of God, there is not a club of clean men in Europe that would deny my right to call him out. If he had said it of my wife, you English would yourselves have pardoned me for beating him like a dog in the market place. Your worship, I have no mother; I have no wife. I have only that which the poor have equally with the rich; which the lonely have equally with the man of many friends. To me this whole strange world is homely, because in the heart of it there is a home; to me this cruel world is kindly, because higher than the heavens there is something more human than humanity. If a man must not fight for this, may he fight for anything? I would fight for my friend, but if I lost my friend, I should still be there. I would fight for my country, but if I lost my country, I should still exist. But if what that devil dreams were true, I should not be--I should burst like a bubble and be gone.

40|$|Abstract: For {{the last}} two years, Korean Highway Cooperation (KHC) has {{developed}} a location-based Dynamic Route Guidance System (DRGS). The targeted end users of the system are mobile-phone users in Korea. The service {{is scheduled to be}} commercialized in 2005. Spatially the system will cover all of the expressways which is about 2, 800 km and some of the National highways which is about 500 km. The focus of this paper is about the use of historical travel time data for travel time forecasting which is embedded in the location-based DRGS development project of KHC. This study firstly shows that for certain future time periods (e. g. 60 <b>minutes</b> later <b>from</b> <b>now</b> on) travel time forecasting using only the historical profile without real-time profile is better than the one using real-time profile or both. Then the methods of constructing historical profile including removing outliers, identifying optimal amount of historical data for the historical profile, and determining optimal update frequency of the historical profile are discussed. Finally the proposed methods are demonstrated with the travel time information collected from Kyongbu expressway in Korea...|$|R

5000|$|The opening {{lines to}} The Book of Fate are, [...] "Six <b>minutes</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> {{one of us}} would be dead. That was our fate. None of us knew it was coming.” Those words are spoken by an aid of the President of the United States named Wes Holloway. The novel begins on July 4 weekend, as the President attends an event.

Eight years later, Boyle turns up alive.

5000|$|Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter {{was first}} {{announced}} by Capcom at the 2002 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles {{as the first}} game in the series {{to appear on the}} PlayStation 2 console. The project was headed by series veteran Makoto Ikehara, who served as director, and was inspired to create the game's dystopian setting after reading the 1994 alternate history novel Gofungo no Sekai (五分後の世界, lit. The World Five <b>Minutes</b> <b>From</b> <b>Now)</b> by Ryū Murakami. The game's unique gameplay elements and high challenge were added to differentiate it from previous entries in the series, which Ikehara felt were [...] "too easy" [...] when compared to other role-playing titles, with the level of difficulty gradually increasing as development went on. Character design was handled by Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who had provided official artwork for all previous Breath of Fire games, and who specifically designed the character Elyon after the main antagonist of the previous game, Fou-Lu, because he [...] "wanted to use the character again". In order to give the dragons Odjn, Dover, and Chetyre their own distinct identity, they were made to speak Russian during cutscenes and were named after the Russian numbers one (один, adeen), two (два, dva), and four (четыре, chyetirye), respectively. Unlike the protagonists of previous Breath of Fire games, each also named Ryu, the Ryu in this game is a normal human being characterized by Yoshikawa as [...] "an average person like you might find anywhere" [...] with his only extraordinary ability being his strong will and sense of justice. In November 2002, the game was released in Japan under its regional title, Breath of Fire V: Dragon Quarter, and was dedicated to the memory of Capcom employee Yasuhito Okada.|$|E

40|$|FIRST PARAGRAPHS] Philosophers often talk as if what {{it takes}} {{for a person to}} persist through time were up to us, as {{individuals}} or as a linguistic community, to decide. In most ordinary situations it might be fully determinate whether someone has survived or perished: barring some unforeseen catastrophe, it is clear enough that you will still exist ten <b>minutes</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> for example. But {{there is no shortage of}} actual and imaginary situations where it is not so clear whether one survives. Here reasonable people may disagree. There are "fission" cases where each of one's cerebral hemispheres is transplanted into a different head; Star-Trek-style "teletransportation" stories; actual cases of brain damage so severe that one can never again regain consciousness, even though one's circulation, breathing, digestion, and other "animal" functions continue; and stories where one's brain cells are gradually removed and replaced by cells from someone else, to name only a few favorites. In many such cases we say, correctly, that the person in question has perished; that is the right answer to the question, Has she survived? But in some of those very situations, we are told that it might have been correct to give the opposite answer, and say that the person perished [...] even if nothing different happened to her. Some philosophers say that we are free to choose at random between saying that the person has survived and saying that she has ceased to exist; both are equally correct descriptions of the same event. Others say that a different answer to the question, Has the person survived? is in fact false, but would be true if we had a different concept of personal identity, or if our conventions for individuating people were different [...] in short, if we thought and spoke differently...|$|E
