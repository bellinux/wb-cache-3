40|$|Epidemiologic {{evidence}} indicates that several markers of exposure to childhood infections are inversely associated with the risk of childhood leukemia and lymphomas. We used the Swedish Family-Cancer Database to assess the effects of number of siblings on the risk of non-Hodgkin’s (n = 7, 007) and Hodgkin’s lymphomas (n = 3, 115), leukemias (n = 7, 650), and multiple myeloma (n = 1, 492) by histopathology. Poisson regression models included terms for age, sex, family history, period, and socioeco-nomic index. Having four or more siblings compared with none was associated with an excess risk of child-hood acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL; rate ratio (RR), 2. 11; P trend = 0. 001], acute <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (RR, 2. 51; P trend = 0. 002), and multiple myeloma (RR, 1. 34; P trend = 0. 006). Having three or more older siblings compared with none decreased the risk of acute <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (RR, 0. 35; Ptrend = 0. 001) and childhood ALL (RR, 0. 69; P trend = 0. 01). The risk of Hodgkin’s lymphoma for five or more older siblings compared with none was 0. 41 (Ptrend = 0. 003). Acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leuke-mia, and other lymphoproliferative malignancies were not associated with number of siblings. In conclusion, we found an excess risk of childhood ALL and acute mono-cytic leukemia in large families. However, for ALL, acute <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, younger siblings were strongly protected compared with older siblings.

40|$|Hypoxia {{inducible}} transcription factors (HIFs) are {{the main}} regulators of adaptive responses to hypoxia and are often activated in solid tumors, but their role in leukemia is less clear. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in particular, controversial new findings indicate that HIF- 1 β can act either as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene, and this may depend {{on the stage of}} leukemia development and/or the AML sub-type. In this study, we find that HIF- 1 β promotes leukemia progression in the acute <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> sub-type of AML through activation of an invasive phenotype. By applying a list of validated HIF- 1 β-target genes to different AML sub-types, we identified a HIF- 1 β signature that typifies acute <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> when compared with all other AML sub-types. We validated expression of this signature in cell lines and primary cells from AML patients. Interestingly, this signature is enriched for genes that control cell motility at different levels. As a consequence, inhibiting HIF- 1 β impaired leukemia cell migration, chemotaxis, invasion and transendothelial migration in vitro, and this resulted in impaired bone marrow homing and leukemia progression in vivo. Our data suggest that in acute <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> an active HIF- 1 β-dependent pro-invasive pathway mediates the ability of leukemic cells to migrate and invade extramedullary sites and may be targeted to reduce leukemia dissemination...|$|R

Simultaneously the author performed the intravenous iron loading tests and the iron-absorption tests with various leukemias, and obtained the following results. However, in the present comparative study on the serum iron and copper, chronic lymphocytic leukemia is excluded {{as the number of}} such cases were too small. 1. In comparing the average value of the serum iron content, acute lymphocytic leukemia shows the greatest value, followed by those of acute myelogenous <b>leukemia,</b> <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> and chronic myelogenous leukemia in the descending order mentioned. The serum copper content is greatest in acute lymphocytic leukemia, and in the descending order of <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> acute myelogenous leukemia, and chronic myelogenous <b>leukemia.</b> Judging <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> from the standpoint of its serum iron content, this type also proves to be an intermediary type between acute type and chronic type. 2.

It is to be noted that chronic lymphocytic leukemia is not included in the present study as the number of such cases was to small. 1. In every leukemia generally immature cells are markedly increased in number; in acute leukemia blast cells occupy the major proportion; and in chronic leukemia young leucocytes in various stages of maturation are mixed. 2. Judging from the hemomyelogram, all cases of <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> seems to occupy an intermediate position between acute leukemia and chronic leukemia.

40|$|With the sternal {{bone marrow}} {{obtained}} from various leukemias definitely diagnosed by their bone-marrow tissue culture the author measured the glycolysis in the sternal bone marrow and obtained the following results. 1. Anaerobic glycolysis of 0. 2 cc/hr sternal bone marrow in leukemia is markedly increased {{as compared with}} that in normal persons, and the grads of such an increase differs according to the form of diseases. Pointing out the form of leukemias from the greater to the lesser acceleration in the anaerobic glycolysis, {{they are in the}} order of acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous <b>leukemia,</b> <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> chronic myelogenous leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 2. The acceleration of X(M) (N) (2) /K is most marked in acute myelogenous <b>leukemia</b> followed by <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> and in chronic myelogenous leukemia it is close to the normal value, while in lymphocytic leukemia it is less than the normal value. In the case with a higher percentage of immature cells there is an increasing tendency in X(M) (N) (2) /K. 3. With a single exception of chronic lymphocytic leukemia Q(M) (N) (2) is accelerated in every form of leukemia, and in pointing out the ones with marked acceleration and down they are in the order of acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous <b>leukemia,</b> <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Moreover, those with greater number of nucleated cells and a higher percentage of immature cells in bone marrow the value of Q(M) (N) (2) tends to be greater. 4. The aerobic glycolysis in leukemia does not show any marked difference from that in arachnoiditis adhaesiva, idiopathic ardiaspasmus, diabetes mellitus, hookworm disease, hypoplastic anaemia and Banti's syndrome. 5. The ratio between the oxygen consumption and anaerobic glycolysis (Q(M) (N) (2) /Qo(2)), though less than that in malignant tumor, is higher than normal. This increase is especially marked in acute leukemia but slight in chronic <b>leukemia,</b> and in <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> it is intermediate between the acute leukemia (myelogenous and lymphocytic) and the chronic leukemia (myelogenous and lymphocytic).

40|$|The author {{carried out}} {{clinical}} and statistical {{observations of the}} peripheral blood picture in various leukemias occurring in the Chugoku-Shikoku District, with a special reference to the comparative study on the two groups treated in our department, namely, the group whose bone marrow was cultured and the other without such a culture finding. However, cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia {{are not included in}} the present statistics as their number was trivial. 1. Hb content and erythrocyte count: The decrease in Hb content and erythrocyte count is most marked in acute myelogenous leukemia, followed by acute lymphocytic leukemia, and it is least in chronic myelogenous leukemia. The decrease in Hb and erythrocytes of <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> occupies an intermediate position between the above two. 2. The color index: The color index is comparatively high in acute type while it tends to be lower in chronic type. 3. Leucocyte count: The aleukemic form is greatest in <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> followed in descending order of that in acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia, and all of these aleukemic ones occupy more than 1 / 3 of the total. However, in chronic myelogenous leukemia it is extremely rare to find the aleukemic form. 4. Reticulocyte count: The reticulocyte count in the peripheral blood of leukemia is generally normal or is increased. 5. Platelet count: The platelet count is about at the normal level in chronic myelogenous leukemia, and in some it is increased. However, it is decreased in all other <b>leukemias.</b> In <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> it resembles that in acute type. 6. Classification of leucocytes: In acute myelogenous leukemia myeloblasts occupy a greater proportion and also matured leucocytes are quite many. Intermediate immature cells are low in percentage but it is rare not to see any intermediate immature cells. In chronic myelogenous leukemia mature neutrophils are numerous but immature neutrophils are a few in number. In acute lymphocytic leukemia a high percentage of lymphatic cells accompanied by a marked increase in lymphoblasts can be observed. In <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> intermdiate mature cells are in a low proportion, and monoblasts are less than in acute type, presenting the characteristic intermediate between acute type and chronic type. Namely, <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> is an intermediate type between acute leukemia and chronic leukemia, {{and it is difficult to}} divide it into acute and chronic types. 7. Relationship between the leucocyte count and leucocyte percentage: On the whole the increase in the number of leucocytes and myeloblast percentage show a mutual relationship. In <b>monocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> those whose increase in the number of leucocytes is more marked show a greater number of monoblasts, approaching to the acute type. 8. Relationship between the leucocyte count and platelet count: There can be seen no relationship between the leucocyte count and platelet count. 9. Relationship between the leucocyte count and swelling of the spleen and lymph nodes: In acute lymphocytic leukemia the more marked is the increase in the number of leucocytes the greater is the palpitation frequency and the degere of swelling of the spleen and lymph nodes.
