25|$|A {{large number}} of progestins (synthetic progestogens) have been derived from progesterone. They can be {{categorized}} into several structural groups, including derivatives of retroprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-methylprogesterone, and 19-norprogesterone, with a respective example from each group including dydrogesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, <b>medrogestone,</b> and promegestone. Quingestrone (progesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether) is among the only examples that {{do not belong to}} any of these groups. Another major group of progestins, the 19-nortestosterone derivatives, exemplified by norethisterone (norethindrone) and levonorgestrel, are not derived from progesterone but rather from testosterone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Medrogestone</b> is {{described}} as a pure progestogen similar in profile to progesterone. In contrast to progesterone however, <b>medrogestone</b> is more potent and is orally active. There is reportedly no information available on the receptor binding of <b>medrogestone</b> at the various steroid hormone receptors. However, based on animal research (e.g., the Clauberg test and other assays), <b>medrogestone</b> appears to be a potent progestogen, devoid of androgenic, estrogenic, and glucocorticoid activity, but with weak antiandrogen and very weak antimineralocorticoid activity. Accordingly, no evidence of androgenic or glucocorticoid activity, including effects on the estrogen-induced increase in triglycerides and HDL cholesterol and adrenal suppression, were observed in clinical studies. However, in a very high-dosage (100 mg/day for 6 months) study of <b>medrogestone</b> for benign prostatic hyperplasia, a hyperglycemic effect and changes in plasma cortisol levels were observed and considered likely to be secondary to glucocorticoid activity, and decreased sodium levels were also observed and attributed to antimineralocorticoid activity. In any case, under normal circumstances (i.e., at typical clinical dosages), <b>medrogestone</b> {{is described}} as a progestogen and antigonadotropin and weak antiandrogen in humans without other clinically relevant activity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Medrogestone,</b> {{also known}} as 6,17α-dimethyl-6-dehydroprogesterone or as 6,17α-dimethyl-4,6-pregnadiene-3,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is structurally related to the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate. <b>Medrogestone</b> itself is not a 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative and is instead a derivative of 17α-methylprogesterone. This is because it features a methyl group at the C17α position instead of a hydroxy or acetoxy group. In addition to its C17α methyl group, <b>medrogestone</b> possesses a methyl group at the C6 position and a double bond between the C6 and C7 positions. The only structural difference between <b>medrogestone</b> and megestrol acetate is {{the replacement of the}} C17α acetoxy group with a methyl group.|$|E
50|$|<b>Medrogestone</b> {{has been}} found to be an {{inhibitor}} of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-4 isomerase in vitro, preventing conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone and 17α-hydroxypregnenolone to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone in rat testis preparations, and inhibits the biosynthesis of testosterone in vivo in rats. In addition, similarly to progesterone, <b>medrogestone</b> can inhibit 5α-reductase in vitro in microsomal preparations of skin and prostate. Although their clinical relevance is uncertain, these actions of <b>medrogestone</b> could contribute to its weak antiandrogen activity.|$|E
50|$|Upon oral administration, <b>medrogestone</b> {{is rapidly}} absorbed, and the {{bioavailability}} is nearly 100%. After ingestion of a 10 mg dose of <b>medrogestone,</b> peak circulating concentrations (Cmax) of 10-15 ng/mL are achieved. The distribution and elimination half-lives of <b>medrogestone</b> are 4 hours and 35-36 hours, respectively. The drug is largely bound (90%) to albumin, and to only small extents to corticosteroid-binding globulin (3%) and sex hormone-binding globulin (2%). Metabolism is most importantly by hydroxylation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Medrogestone</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{during pregnancy}} because progestogens {{are associated with}} risks for the fetus in animals and humans. Studies in pregnant rabbits have shown skeletal deformations under 3 mg/kg <b>medrogestone</b> but not under 1 mg/kg. Typical therapeutic doses of the drug are between 0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg.|$|E

5000|$|Androgen {{synthesis}} inhibitors: {{drugs that}} directly inhibit the enzymatic biosynthesis of androgens like testosterone and/or DHT. Examples include the CYP17A1 inhibitors ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate, and seviteronel, the CYP11A1 (P450scc) inhibitor aminoglutethimide, and the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride, dutasteride, epristeride, alfatradiol, and saw palmetto extract (Serenoa repens). A {{number of other}} antiandrogens, including cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, <b>medrogestone,</b> flutamide, nilutamide, and bifluranol, are also known to weakly inhibit androgen synthesis.|$|E
50|$|MPA is a {{synthetic}} pregnane (C21) steroid and a derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. Specifically, {{it is the}} 17α-acetate ester of medroxyprogesterone or the 6α-methylated analogue of hydroxyprogesterone acetate. MPA is known chemically as 6α-methyl-17α-acetoxyprogesterone or as 6α-methyl-17α-acetoxypregn-4-en-3,20-dione, and its generic name is a contraction of 6α-methyl-17α-hydroxyprogesterone acetate.

Aside from cyproterone acetate and chlormadinone acetate, {{a few other}} progestins used in oral contraceptives and/or in menopausal HRT including dienogest, drospirenone, <b>medrogestone,</b> and nomegestrol acetate also have varying degrees of AR antagonistic activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{observation}} of two-fold improved potency of 17α-MP relative to progesterone led to {{renewed interest in}} 17α-substituted derivatives of progesterone. Subsequently, hydroxyprogesterone acetate and hydroxyprogesterone caproate were synthesized in 1953 and introduced in 1956 and 1957, respectively, and medroxyprogesterone acetate was discovered in 1956 and introduced in 1959. In addition, though 17α-MP itself was never introduced for medical use, progestogen derivatives of the compound, including <b>medrogestone</b> (1966) and the 19-norprogesterone derivatives demegestone (1974), promegestone (1983), and trimegestone (2001), have been marketed.|$|E
5000|$|... 6-Methyl-16-dehydropregnenolone acetate (5) {{is the key}} {{intermediate}} to {{the preparation}} of both melengesterol acetate and <b>medrogestone.</b> Petrov and his collaborators have devised several interesting schemes that go back to diosgenin as the starting point. These schemes perform the necessary modifications in rings A and B with the sapogenin side chain still in place. In essence this approach employs this side chain as a protecting group for the future 16-dehydro-20-ketone function. In one of these routes, diosgenin is first converted to the 3-toluenesulfonate (1). Solvolysis of this homoallylic alcohol derivative affords the 3,5-cyclosteroid (2), via the cyclopropyl carbinyl ion (carbenium ion) (not shown). (This general reaction was probably first found in the steroids and bore the name of [...] "i-steroid rearrangement.") Oxidation of the product by means of PCC affords the ketone. Reaction of this with methylmagnesium iodide affords two isomeric carbinols with the α-isomer predominating (3). Solvolysis {{in the presence of}} a nucleophile such as acetic acid reverses the cyclopropylcarbinyl transformation to afford homoallylic acetate. Removal of the sapogenin side chain leads to the desired product (5).Substitution at the 16 position was found to lead to further potentiation of progestational activity. Reaction with diazomethane at the conjugated double bond at 16 gives first the pyrazole (6). This heterocycle affords the 16 methyl enone on pyrolysis (7). Selective epoxidation of the conjugated double bond to the 16,17α-epoxide over that at 5,6 is achieved by oxidation with basic hydrogen peroxide (8). Opening of this tetrasubstituted oxirane ring in acid proceeds with loss of a proton from the β position (16 methyl) (9) to afford the desired 16-methylene-17α-hydroxy-20-ketone functionality in the D ring (10). The product is saponified and then the subject of an Oppenauer oxidation, which is then dehydrogenated to the 4,6-diene with chloranil (11). Acetylation under forcing conditions completes the synthesis of melengesterol acetate.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} bleeding {{pattern and}} endometrium following {{the administration of}} two of the most common types of progestogens used in hormone replacement therapy, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and <b>medrogestone</b> acetate. Twenty eight patients in spontaneous menopause were randomly allocated to two groups. Group 1 (n = 14) received 5 mg/day of MPA and group 2 (n = 14) received 5 mg/day of medrogestone: both the progestogens were sequentially added for the last 12 days of a 21 -day period of transdermalestradiol administration (50 g per day). A 7 -day treatment-free period completed the cycle. The study treatments were administered for 6 cycles. The endometria were checked for their thickness by transvaginal ultrasound before starting treatment and at 6 th treatment cycle (days 6 - 10 of the estrogen-only phase and during the period between days 8 and 12 of the progestogen addition). Endometrial biopsies were performed before starting treatment only in the patients with a positive progesterone challenge test and in all the patients {{at the end of the}} study during the addition of the progestogen. The bleeding pattern was closely monitored. MPA is accompanied by a thick endometrium with full secretory transformation in all cases. On the contrary, the same dose of <b>medrogestone</b> induced a consistent decrease of estrogen primed endometrium with only 4 cases of full secretory transformation. Four medrogcstone-treated patients dropped out due to unscheduled bleeding. A low dose of <b>medrogestone</b> added to transdermalestradiol induced incomplete transformation of endometrium and oligo-amenorrhea more frequently than MPA, but it increased the chances of irregular bleeding. MPA fully transformed the endometrium: periods were thus heavier but regular. None of the patients in either group had endometrial hyperplasia...|$|E

40|$|Ipriflavone is a {{synthetic}} flavonoid {{that has been}} shown to exert a direct inhibitory effect on osteoclastic activity and possibly stimulate the osteoblast activity in different experimental models. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effects of either ipriflavone alone or ipriflavone plus low dose hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the prevention of postmenopausal bone loss. Patients were randomly allocated to different treatment groups receiving calcium (500 mg/day, control group), continuous HRT (25 or 50 micrograms/day of transdermal 17 beta-estradiol) plus <b>medrogestone</b> 5 mg/day for 12 days/month, ipriflavone at the standard dose of 600 mg/day, or finally ipriflavone 600 mg/day plus 17 beta-estradiol 25 micrograms/day plus <b>medrogestone</b> 5 mg/day for 12 days/month. No significant differences in basal levels of biochemical markers of bone turnover or in basal bone mineral density (BMD) values were evident in the different groups. In the control group after 12 months, spine BMD showed a significant (p < 0. 05) 3. 41 % decrease. The pattern of BMD modification was significantly different from controls in the high dose HRT group (+ 1. 84 %), the ipriflavone group (+ 0. 11 %), and the combined ipriflavone/HRT group (- 0. 22 %). Conversely, the BMD pattern in the low dose HRT group (- 0. 55 %) was similar to that observed in controls. Thus, present results confirm that ipriflavone and 50 micrograms/day of transdermal 17 beta-estradiol are effective measures in the prevention of postmenopausal osteopenia. A lower transdermal estrogen dose is unable to increase the antiresorptive effect of ipriflavone and did not exert any further action in the prevention of postmenopausal osteopenia...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} role of {{male and}} female sex hormones in the regulation of gastric acid secretion, was studied in the guinea-pig. Castration of male guinea-pigs produced a strong reduction in the gastric secretory capacity of animals castrated at least 3 months prior to gastric juice analysis. Ovariectomy was shown to have no significant influence on gastric secretion in females. Administration of testosterone (5 mg/kg) into males castrated 3 months previously restored gastric acid secretion to normal control levels.

40|$|Abstract. Background: Sulfotransferases {{are present}} in normal and {{cancerous}} human breast tissues. The {{purpose of this article}} is to present a hypothetical correlation of sulfotransferase activity with proliferation in breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Sulfotransferases were evaluated in breast cancer cells by determining the transformation of non-conjugated estrogens to the sulfates. Proliferation was evaluated by the action on cell growth or the size of a transplanted tumor. The effect was obtained using the progestins: nomegestrol acetate, promegestone, and <b>medrogestone,</b> as well as tibolone and its metabolites at concentrations of 5 x 10 – 5 to 5 x 10 – 9 M. Results: A possible correlation of sulfotransferase activity stimulation and cell growth inhibition provoked by the various progestins used, or by tibolone and its metabolites was shown. Conclusion: It is suggested that the antiproliferative effect of these compounds could be related to the decrease of bioactive estradiol by the formation of its biologically inactive sulfate as a consequence of the stimulatory effect by the various progestins or tibolone on sulfotransferase activity.
