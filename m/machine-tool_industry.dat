50|$|Overall, the <b>machine-tool</b> <b>industry</b> {{was based}} on 1960s technology. Many of the tools had a service life of only five to seven years, {{compared}} with twelve to fifteen years in industrialized countries. The tools were generally unreliable and ill-suited for precision work because of outdated design, low quality purchased components, substandard manufacturing facilities, {{and a lack of}} production-management expertise.|$|E

40|$|An {{upcoming}} industrial IoT revolution, supposedly led by {{the introduction}} of embedded sensing and computing, seamless communication and massive data analytics within industrial processes [1], seems unquestionable today. Multiple technologies are being developed, and huge marketing efforts are being made to position solutions in this industrial landscape. However, we have observed that industrial wireless technologies are hardly being adopted by the manufacturing industry. In this article, we try to understand the reasons behind this current lack of wireless technologies adoption by means of conducting visits to the manufacturing industry and interviews with the maintenance and engineering teams in these industries. The manufacturing industry is very diverse and specialized, so we have tried to cover some of the most representative cases: the automotive sector, the pharmaceutical sector (blistering), <b>machine-tool</b> <b>industries</b> (both consumer and aerospace sectors) and robotics. We have analyzed the technology of their machinery, their application requirements and restrictions, and identified a list of obstacles for wireless technology adoption. The most immediate obstacles we have found are the need to strictly follow standards and certifications processes, as well as their prudence. But the less obvious and perhaps even more limiting obstacles are their apparent lack of concern regarding low energy consumption or cost which, in contrast, are believed to be of utmost importance by wireless researchers and practitioners. In this reality-check article, we analyze the causes of this different perception, we identify these obstacles and devise complementary paths to make wireless adoption by the industrial manufacturing sector a reality in the coming years.

50|$|This {{area was}} a part of bhurshut kingdom. This area was mainly {{developed}} under British occupation when ceded by Nawab of Murshidabad after the Battle of Plassey. With the establishment of the Howrah Railway Terminus in 1854 started the most important phase of its industrial development. Flour mills were established in 1855, followed by Jute mills and around the 1870s, there were five mills near Howrah station.11 The Howrah-Shalimar Railway Section and the Shalimar Terminus were constructed in 1883.Kadamtala was also a major railway junction of Martin's Light Railways. Kadamtala has turned to an industrial area during world war II. A high demand of iron leads to establish a number of small and medium-sized iron-casting industries. Gradually the city of Howrah was called as Sheffield of Bengal when Mr. Alamohan Das established a large factory township named Dasnagar. A large number of Machines/tools/precision instruments manufacturiing factories were established.All the above reasons result to a flow of population from rural belts of Howrah, Hooghly and Midnapur districts to this area to meet the demand of a high demand of labor. Gradually, this area has become a densely populated area with the location advantage of industries of Dasnagar in west, Howrah Railway terminus in east.The rapid growth of population and negligence of planned infrastructure of the British Government and then flux of people from Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) leads to a breakdown of infrastructure of unplanned and narrow roads. The economic decline of West Bengal after partition of India also causes a big blow to Howrah's famous jute and <b>machine-tools</b> <b>industries.</b>|$|R

50|$|Britain was Portugal's largest {{trading partner}} {{and had the}} right to force her to fight on her side under a 500-year-old alliance, but allowed her to remain neutral; in return Portugal allowed credit when Britain was short of gold and escudos, so that by 1945 Britain owed Portugal £322 million. Germany was Portugal's second-largest trading partner, {{initially}} paying for exports with consumer goods, but after 1942 increasingly with looted gold, which the Allies warned was liable to confiscation after the war. Portugal also allowed Germany generous credit terms, partly because after the fall of France the presence of a direct land route enabled Germany to threaten Portugal with invasion if she curtailed critical exports. The Allies, who also bought Portuguese tungsten, believed that if they could persuade the Portuguese to stop selling the ore the German <b>machine-tool</b> <b>industry</b> would very quickly be crippled and she would be unable to continue to fight. Because Portugal depended on the U.S. for petroleum, coal and chemical supplies, the Allies' economic warfare agencies considered achieving their aim by embargoes, but hesitated because they also wanted access to Portuguese military bases on the Azores.|$|E

Producers have to obtain in‐depth knowledge about customers’ needs and customers need knowledge on producer's absorptive capacity. Producers distinguish between three types of customer: reference customers, necessary for innovations with greatest scope, clientes amigos or test users, required to test innovations currently being developed, and traditional customers, associated with incremental innovations. The traditional means of protecting innovations is the detailed contract between customer and supplier; patents are used for innovations of greater technological scope, {{as a form of}} defense against third‐party patents and as a signaling element of absorptive capacity. Originality: The paper draws on the direct experience of executives from companies whose innovation is based on a close relationship with customers, in order to answer questions to which the literature has yet to provide definitive answers: What sort of information to be shared is relevant for the generation of innovations? Are all customers equal or are there profiles that contribute more effectively to the development of innovations?

40|$|Although {{clusters}} {{life cycles}} tend to co-evolve {{with the life}} cycle of its dominant industry (Bergman, 2008; Menzel and Fornahl, 2010), the stylized life cycle model does not capture the full complexity of cluster evolution (Martin and Sunley, 2011). Empirical studies indicate that clusters do not necessarily follow the life cycles of their dominant industries, as different clusters that belong to the same industry life cycle follow different evolutionary paths (Saxenian, 1994). Thus, clusters are not just a local representation of an industry and local peculiarities also matter for the evolution of a particular cluster (Menzel and Fornahl, 2010). Empirical studies have pointed out that local factors such as factor endowment, entrepreneurship and firms? capabilities, an existing market, or institutions and social capital may have an impact on it (Belussi and Sedita, 2009; Elola et al., 2012). The Basque Country is an old industrialized European region that successfully managed to escape from a lock-in situation in the 1980 s renewing its industrial base by upgrading some of its mature clusters and by promoting new high tech ones. Based on the experience of the Basque Country, in this paper, we aim at analyzing whether clusters co-evolve with their corresponding industry or deviate from it. In addition, we also study which are the local factors that explain such behaviors. For that purpose, we draw on a meta-study of six clusters of the Basque Country: papermaking, maritime <b>industries,</b> <b>machine-tools,</b> electronics and ICTs, aeronautics and energy.

40|$|What {{determined}} {{the volatility of}} asset prices in Germany between the wars? This paper argues that the influence of political factors has been overstated. The majority of events increasing political uncertainty {{had little or no}} effect on the value of German assets and the volatility of returns on them. Instead, it was inflation (and the fear of it) that is largely responsible for most of the variability in asset returns. Few periods in history show a closer connection between political events and economic change than the Weimar Republic. The extent to which the collapse of democracy was a result of misguided economic policies (and a structurally weakened economy in general) produced heated debate. That the politically induced uncertainty and the inflation {{during the early years of}} the Republic were economically harmful has also been contended, even if some scholars continue to argue that the inflation had many benign effects. Holtfrerich (1991) argues that inflation was not only necessary to integrate returning soldiers into the economy, but that Germany may have saved the world economy from a major recession in the early 1920 s. Since it was relatively economically buoyant at the same time when the UK and the US experienced post-war recessions, its high demand for imports from these countries helped to avert a complete collapse. An older literature had also assumed that high inflation had facilitated investment. Industry-level studies, such as the one of the <b>machine-tool</b> <b>industry</b> by Lindenlaub, have failed to provide much evidence in favour of this. The benign effects of inflation have been challenged by Ferguson (1995, 1996), who argues that neither political nor economic benefit...|$|E
40|$|Closed {{kinematic}} chains (CKCs) are constrained multibody {{systems that}} contain closed kinematic loops. Nowadays, CKCs {{are used in}} a variety of applications ranging from flight simulators to medical instruments, and are becoming increasingly popular in the <b>machine-tool</b> <b>industry</b> and haptic interfaces due to their better performance in terms of accuracy, rigidity and payload capacity as compared to open-chain mechanisms. This document intends to present a novel methodology for the modeling and control of general CKCs. The dynamics of CKCs are characterized by index- 3 differential algebraic equations (DAEs). Dynamic models in the form of DAEs pose difficulties in model-based control because most existing control design techniques are devised for explicit state space models. The control methodology presented in this document is based on a singular perturbation formulation (SPF), which has attractive properties including the minimum dimension of its slow dynamics and the large validity domain that contains the entire singularity-free workspace of the CKCs. The key issue of the model approximation error is addressed under different stability conditions. Explicit error bounds are derived and sufficient conditions for the exponential convergence of the approximation errors are established. For the control of CKCs, our approach transfers the control of the original DAE system to the control of an artificially created singularly perturbed system. Compared to control methods which directly solve the nonlinear algebraic constraint equations, the proposed method uses an ODE solver to obtain the dependent coordinates, hence eliminating the need for Newton type iterations and is amenable to real-time implementation. The closed loop system, when controlled by typical open kinematic chain schemes, achieves asymptotic trajectory tracking. The efficacy of the approach is illustrated by simulating the dynamics of a CKC mechanism, the Rice Planar Delta Robot, and then by validating the simulation results with experimental data. Thus, this work establishes a framework in which the control of CKCs can be systematically addressed...|$|E

40|$|Virtual {{testing of}} portal machine tool {{has been carried}} out with the help of finite {{elements}} method (FEM). Static, modal and harmonic analyses have been made for a heavy planer. The paper reveals influence of concrete filler on machine tool dynamic flexibility. A peculiar feature of the simulation is concrete filling of a high-level transverse beam. Such approach oes look a typical one for <b>machine-tool</b> <b>industry.</b> Concrete has been considered as generalized material in two variants. It has been established that concrete application provides approximately 3 -fold increase in machine tool rigidity per each coordinate. In this regard it is necessary to arrange closure of rigidity contour by filling all the cavities inside of the portal. Modal FEA makes it possible to determine that concrete increases comparatively weakly (1. 3 – 1. 4 -fold) frequencies of resonance modes. Frequency of the lowest mode rises only from 30. 25 to 42. 86 Hz. The following most active whole-machine eigenmodes have been revealed in the paper: “Portal pecking”, “Parallelogram” and “Traverse pecking”. In order to restrain the last mode it is necessary to carry out concrete filling of the traverse, in particular. Frequency-response characteristics and curves of dynamic rigidity for a spindle have been plotted for 0 – 150 Hz interval while using harmonic FEM. It has been determined that concrete increases dynamic machine tool rigidity by 2. 5 – 3. 5 -fold. The effect is obtained even in the case when weakly damping concrete (2 %) is used. This is due to distribution of vibrational energy flow along concrete and along cast iron as well. Thus energy density and vibration amplitudes must decrease. The paper shows acceptability for internal reinforcement of high-level machine tool parts (for example, portal traverses) and fillers are applied for this purpose. Traverse weighting is compensated by additional torsional, shear and bending rigidity. The machine tool obtains the possibility for rough intermittent cutting even at resonance frequencies. Complete concrete filling of portal cavities is definitely a positive action for static and dynamic properties of the machine tool. </p...|$|E
