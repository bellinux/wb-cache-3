5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{valuable}} use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate the <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> the stars. This requires the dimensions and inclination of the orbit to be accurately known. The dimensions of Eta Carinae's orbit are only known approximately as the stars cannot be directly and separately observed. The inclination has been modelled at 130–145 degrees, but the orbit is still not known accurately enough to provide the <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> the two components.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the large}} <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> the W bosons, {{particle}} transformations or decays (e.g., flavour change) that depend on the weak interaction typically occur much more slowly than transformations or decays that depend only on the strong or electromagnetic forces. For example, a neutral pion decays electromagnetically, and so has a life of only about 10−16seconds. In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through the weak interaction, and so lives about 10−8seconds, or a hundred million times longer than a neutral pion. A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15minutes.|$|E

40|$|Major element {{fractionation}} among chondrites {{has been}} discussed for decades as ratios relative to Si or Mg.

Here, {{on the basis of}} that relationship, I derive expressions, as a function <b>of</b> the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> planet Mercury and the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> its core, to estimate the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> Mercury’s “lost elements”, the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> Mercury’s “alloy and rock ” protoplanetary core, and the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> Mercury’s gaseous protoplanet.
