25|$|The primary {{benefit of}} DDR3 SDRAM over its {{immediate}} predecessor, DDR2 SDRAM, {{is its ability}} to transfer data at twice the rate (eight times the speed of its internal memory arrays), enabling higher bandwidth or peak data rates. With two transfers per cycle of a quadrupled clock signal, a 64-bit wide DDR3 module may achieve a transfer rate (in megabytes per second, MB/s) of up to 64 times the <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> speed (in MHz). With data being transferred 64 bits at a time per memory module, DDR3 SDRAM gives a transfer rate of (<b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> rate) × 4 (for bus clock multiplier) × 2 (for data rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus with a <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> frequency of 100MHz, DDR3 SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 6400 MB/s.|$|E

50|$|Changing some {{parameters}} in the BIOS {{will cause}} this issue, even for just setting a system as stock speeds, such as initializing the current CPU and <b>memory</b> <b>clocks.</b> When certain parameters, {{such as the}} ones before, from the BIOS are set, it will require a reboot.|$|R
50|$|Although S3 {{graphics}} {{does not}} sell Chrome S25 video cards, {{they can be}} found under the Xiai brand in Japan and the Axper brand in China. Both these cards have their GPU clockspeed and <b>memory</b> <b>clocked</b> 100 mHz higher than the default specification giving a 700 MHz memory and 500 MHz GPU clock speeds.|$|R
50|$|Codenamed Redwood XT, the 5600 {{series has}} {{all five of}} Redwood's shader engines enabled. As each of them has 80 VLIW-5 units, this gave it 400 stream processors. Reference clocks were 775 MHz for all 5600s, while <b>memory</b> <b>clocks</b> varied between OEMs, as did the use of DDR3 and GDDR5 memory, the latter being twice as fast.|$|R
5000|$|Suppose a {{computer}} system has DDR memory, a Memory Divider of 1:1, a FSB operating at 200 MHz and a CPU multiplier of 10x. Then, the base <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> will operate at (Memory Divider) × (FSB) = 1 × 200 = 200 MHz and the effective <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> would be 400 MHz since it is a DDR system ("DDR" [...] stands for Double Data Rate; the effective <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> speed is double the actual clock speed). The CPU will operate at 10 × 200 MHz = 2.0 GHz. Using I/O bus frequency of 200 MHz various types of DRAM will operate as: ...|$|E
50|$|Now {{suppose that}} we overclock FSB to 250 MHz so that CPU {{operates}} at 10 × 250 MHz = 2.5 GHz and <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> operates at 250 MHz (Memory Divider × FSB). Since DDR-400 RAM is used then effective <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> (Actual Memory Frequency) will be 500 MHz. A normal DDR-400 SDRAM {{will fail to}} work at 500 MHz since {{it is designed to}} work at 400 MHz and system will become unstable. But a modern CPU (having overclocking potential) can work at 2.5 GHz (even if it is designed to work at 2 GHz) flawlessly without giving any problem of stability. To keep running overclocked CPU at 2.5 GHz or even at higher speeds (by increasing FSB) we need to slow down <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> so as to achieve a stable system. For this if we decrease DRAM:FSB ratio to say 4:5 then resulting <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> speed is (4/5) × 250 MHz = 200 MHz resulting effective clock speed of 400 MHz on DDR-400. So, we are able to operate upon a stable overclocked CPU at 2.5 GHz from 2 GHz without increasing effective <b>memory</b> <b>clock.</b>|$|E

50|$|BFG Technologies {{originally}} {{introduced a}} unique PCI {{variant of the}} GeForce 6200 via its namesake B.F.G. and 3D Fuzion product lines. Subsequently, PNY (GeForce 6200 256 MB PCI), SPARKLE Computer (GeForce 6200 128 MB PCI and GeForce 6200 256 MB PCI), and eVGA (e-GeForce 6200 256 MB PCI) released their own PCI versions of the Geforce 6200 featuring higher <b>memory</b> <b>clocks</b> and resultant <b>memory</b> bandwidth.|$|R
5000|$|Free and {{open-source}} drivers {{support a}} large portion (but not all) of the features available in GeForce-branded cards. For example, [...] nouveau driver lacks support for the GPU and <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> frequency adjustments, and for associated dynamic power management. Also, Nvidia's proprietary drivers consistently perform better than nouveau in various benchmarks. [...] However, [...] and version 3.16 of the Linux kernel mainline, contributions by Nvidia allowed partial support for GPU and <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> frequency adjustments to be implemented.|$|E
50|$|Memory {{dividers}} {{are only}} applicable to those chipsets in which memory speed {{is dependent on}} FSB speeds. Certain chipsets like nVidia 680i have separate memory and FSB lanes due to which <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> and FSB clock are asynchronous and memory dividers are not used there. Setting memory speeds and overclocking memory systems in such chipsets are different issues which do not use memory dividers. This article {{is only applicable to}} those chipsets in which the <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> is dependent on FSB clock.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{benefit of}} DDR3 SDRAM over its {{immediate}} predecessor, DDR2 SDRAM, {{is its ability}} to transfer data at twice the rate (eight times the speed of its internal memory arrays), enabling higher bandwidth or peak data rates. With two transfers per cycle of a quadrupled clock signal, a 64-bit wide DDR3 module may achieve a transfer rate (in megabytes per second, MB/s) of up to 64 times the <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> speed (in MHz). With data being transferred 64 bits at a time per memory module, DDR3 SDRAM gives a transfer rate of (<b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> rate) × 4 (for bus clock multiplier) × 2 (for data rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus with a <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> frequency of 100 MHz, DDR3 SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 6400 MB/s.|$|E
50|$|After {{clearing}} the old 8800 GS stock, Nvidia revised the specification {{with a new}} core, and 512 MB of <b>memory</b> <b>clocked</b> at 900 MHz on a 256-bit bus. For these cards, the number of stream processors is halved to 48, with the core frequency increased to 650 MHz and the shader frequency increased to 1625 MHz. Some of these cards have 1024 megabytes of memory while still being a 512 model. The revised version is considered inferior in performance to the old version.|$|R
50|$|NVIDIA {{refreshed}} {{the lineup}} in October 2001 {{with the release}} of the GeForce 3 Ti200 and Ti500. This coincided with ATI's releases of the Radeon 8500 and Radeon 7500. The Ti500 has higher core and <b>memory</b> <b>clocks</b> (240 MHz core/250 MHz RAM) than the original GeForce 3 (200 MHz/230 MHz), and generally matches the Radeon 8500. The Ti200 was the slowest, and lowest-priced GeForce3 release. It is clocked lower (175 MHz/200 MHz) yet it surpasses the Radeon 7500 in speed and feature set besides dual-monitor implementation.|$|R
25|$|Note {{that because}} {{internal}} operations are at 1/2 the <b>clock</b> rate, DDR2-400 <b>memory</b> (internal <b>clock</b> rate 100MHz) has somewhat higher latency than DDR-400 (internal clock rate 200MHz).|$|R
50|$|Finally {{with the}} {{performance}} aim, additional execution resource (more CUDA Core, register and cache) and with Kepler’s ability to achieve a <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> speed of 6 GHz, increases Kepler performance when compare to previous Nvidia GPUs.|$|E
5000|$|Memory Dividers allows {{system memory}} to run slower than or {{faster than the}} actual FSB (Front Side Bus) speed. Ideally, Front Side Bus and system memory should run at the same clock speed because FSB connects system memory to the CPU. But, it is {{sometimes}} desired to run the FSB and system memory at different clock speeds. It is possible to run FSB and <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> at different clock speeds, within certain limits of the motherboard and corresponding chipset. So, settings termed as Memory Divider or FSB/DRAM settings are available and are expressed in a [...] "ratio" [...] which control the difference in <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> rate and FSB speed.|$|E
50|$|Clock Speeds: Both {{the core}} and <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> speeds of a 'pro'-suffix card are {{considerably}} higher than most other cards. However, {{over the past few}} years, it has been overshadowed by the XT suffix, and those derived from it.|$|E
5000|$|At introduction, the 6600 {{family was}} only {{available}} in PCI Express form. AGP models became available roughly a month later, {{through the use}} of Nvidia's AGP-PCIe bridge chip. A majority of the AGP GeForce 6600GTs have their <b>memory</b> <b>clocked</b> at 900 MHz, which is 100 MHz slower than the PCI-E cards, on which the memory operates at 1000 MHz. This can contribute to a performance decline when playing certain games. However, it was often possible to [...] "overclock" [...] the memory to its nominal frequency of 1000 MHz and there are AGP cards (for example from XFX) that use 1000 MHz by default.|$|R
50|$|The GeForce 9600 GSO was {{essentially}} a renamed 8800 GS. This tactic has been seen before in products such as the GeForce 7900 GTO to clear unsold stock when it is made obsolete by the next generation. Just like the 8800 GS, the 9600 GSO features 96 stream processors, a 550 MHz core clock with shaders clocked at 1,375 MHz, and either 384 or 768 MB of <b>memory</b> <b>clocked</b> at 800 MHz on a 192-bit memory bus. Some manufacturers have mistakenly listed some of their 768 MB models that have 96 stream processors as being based on the G94 chip, rather than the G92.|$|R
50|$|The 512 MB {{version of}} the GeForce 7800 GTX was {{released}} on November 14, 2005. The card features more than simply an increased frame buffer from 256 MB to 512 MB. The card features a much improved core clock speed of 550 MHz vs. 430 MHz (27.9% increase) and fast 1.1 ns GDDR3 <b>memory</b> <b>clocked</b> at 1.7 GHz vs. 1.2 GHz (41.7% increase), {{when compared to the}} original version. Like ATI's X1800 XT, the addition of another 256 MB of memory, and to a lesser extent, the increased clock speeds, have raised the heat and power output significantly. To combat this, the GeForce 7800 GTX 512 sports a much larger yet quieter dual slot cooling solution when compared to the original 256 MB version.|$|R
50|$|Usually (Memory Divider) × (Front Side Bus Frequency) gives I/O Bus clock of the memory. <b>Memory</b> <b>clock</b> then {{determines the}} final {{operating}} frequency or effective clock speed of memory system depending upon DRAM types (DDR, DDR2 and DDR3 SDRAM).|$|E
50|$|The GeForce 7800 GT is {{the second}} GPU in the series, {{launched}} on August 11, 2005 with immediate retail availability. It has 20 pixel pipelines, 7 vertex shaders, 16 ROPs and a 400 MHz core clock, 500 MHz <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> (1 GHz effective) using GDDR3 memory.|$|E
50|$|Power {{savings are}} {{achieved}} {{primarily due to}} an improved manufacturing process through die shrinkage, resulting in a drop in operating voltage (1.8 V compared to DDR's 2.5 V). The lower <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> frequency may also enable power reductions in applications {{that do not require}} the highest available data rates.|$|E

50|$|Theoretically, dual-channel {{configurations}} {{double the}} memory bandwidth {{when compared to}} single-channel configurations. This {{should not be confused}} with double data rate (DDR) memory, which doubles the usage of DRAM bus by transferring data both on the rising and falling edges of the <b>memory</b> bus <b>clock</b> signals.|$|R
40|$|A 167 -processor 65 nm {{computational}} platform {{well suited}} for DSP, communication, and multimedia workloads contains 164 programmable processors with dynamic supply voltage and dynamic clock frequency circuits, three algorithm-specific processors, and three 16 KB shared <b>memories,</b> all <b>clocked</b> by independent oscillators and connected by configurable long-distance-capable links...|$|R
50|$|The 500 MHz GDDR2 <b>memory</b> <b>clock,</b> {{combined}} with the cards 64 bit memory bus, gives it a total memory bandwidth of 8GB/s, on par with budget cards from Nvidia and AMD. Performance information released by S3 indicates the cards performance in 3dMark 2006 is comparable to an AMD HD4350.|$|E
50|$|Finally, with Kepler, Nvidia {{was able}} to {{increase}} the <b>memory</b> <b>clock</b> to 6 GHz. To accomplish this, Nvidia needed to design an entirely new memory controller and bus. While still shy of the theoretical 7 GHz limitation of GDDR5, this is well above the 4 GHz speed of the memory controller for Fermi.|$|E
50|$|Memory {{transactions}} are 128-byte wide, the same width as the cache {{line of the}} MIPS microprocessors used. A memory read is completed in two cycles of the <b>memory</b> <b>clock,</b> and is buffered by the leaf controllers before it is placed in a sent over the POWERpath-2 bus in four cycles of the POWERpath-2 bus clock.|$|E
50|$|AMD {{released}} a special variant of its Radeon HD 5870 graphics card called the Radeon HD 5870 Eyefinity 6 Edition, which features 2GB GDDR5 <b>memory,</b> higher <b>clock</b> speeds {{than the original}} card, and six Mini DisplayPort outputs with a maximum resolution of 5760 × 2160 pixels (a 3×2 grid of 1080p displays).|$|R
25|$|With data being {{transferred}} 64 bits at a time, DDR SDRAM gives a transfer rate (in bytes/s) of (<b>memory</b> bus <b>clock</b> rate) × 2 (for dual rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus, with a bus frequency of 100MHz, DDR SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 1600MB/s.|$|R
50|$|Although the DRAM is asynchronous, {{the signals}} are {{typically}} {{generated by a}} <b>clocked</b> <b>memory</b> controller, which limits their timing to multiples of the controller's clock cycle.|$|R
