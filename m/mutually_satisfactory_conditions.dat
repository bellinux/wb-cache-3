40|$|Abstract: Negotiation is {{a process}} of human communication, {{involving}} two parties, where each with his preconceived belief and objectives, trying to reach a <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> result after exchanging and reconciling over matters. Negotiation can be computationally modeled using CBR techniques. The negotiators represent their negotiated terms as cases, either as a flat case or multi-dimensional case. We built the negotiation engine which performs negotiation on multi-dimensional case. This engine is built on Re-maker, a system which searches suitable partner by negotiating the differences in values specified by both negotiators. Episode strategy is the negotiation technique we adopt in our negotiation engine. The generic multidimensional CBR computation model for iterative matching in with negotiation is produced. 1. 0 Introduction to Negotiation 1. 1 The Definition and the type of Negotiation Negotiation {{is a process}} of human communication, involving two parties trying to reach a <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> result after exchanging an...|$|R

Information-based argumentation aims {{to model}} the partner’s reason-ing {{apparatus}} {{to the extent that}} an agent can work with it to achieve outcomes that are <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> and lay the foundation for continued interaction and per-haps lasting business relationships.

Using augmentative dialogue that describes what is good or bad about proposals, these agents observe such statements and aim {{to model the}} way their partners react, and then to generate dialogue that works in harmony with their partner’s reasoning. ...|$|R
