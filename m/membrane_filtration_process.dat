Its advantages over conventional pre-treatment include: very high water quality independent of the contaminants in the initial raw water, a plant that is simpler in design and more flexible, which makes it easier to automate, lower use of chemicals, and final product free of viruses and microorganisms.|$|E

The low adhesion of bacteria to soil is essential key for the success of in-situ bioremediation in groundwater treatment. However, the contamination of pathogens in drinking water could be linked to the transportation of microorganisms in groundwater and other water sources.

40|$|As of today, the {{application}} of membrane bioreactors (MBRs) in wastewater treatment plants has become significantly important in various industries. The success of MBR is {{mainly because of the}} effective membrane technology used in this kind of reactor. However, membrane technology does not escape from several drawbacks, which includes high maintenance costs and fouling problems. In order to run a plant with both an optimum capability and cost, an in-depth understanding of the behavior of filtration systems is very important to the plant operator. In this paper, we review and have considered the fouling control techniques applied to submerged <b>membrane</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>processes</b> including hollow fiber membranes and flat sheet types of <b>membrane</b> <b>filtration.</b> The review covers the techniques involving operational parameters, such as aeration, backwashing, and relaxation.

40|$|Colloidal {{particles}} in the feed streams of <b>membrane</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>processes</b> control <b>membrane</b> fouling rate in many instances. In this study, the non-gelling colloidal Na-alginate and the gelling colloidal Ca-alginate are employed to investigate the significance of gel layer formation in <b>membrane</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>processes</b> in terms of contribution to membrane fouling and supplementary impurity removal. The results show that contribution of colloidal particles to membrane fouling depends on the gelling propensity of the colloids and the operational mode (constant pressure or constant flux) implemented. A small dose of either Na-alginate or Ca-alginate was found to greatly increase membrane fouling rate during constant pressure filtration. Both the resistance to removal by application of shear and the lower susceptibility of the concentration polarization layer to shear resulted in more severe fouling during constant flux filtration {{in the presence of}} Ca-alginate assemblages than in the presence of Na-alginate. Apparent channel sizes of the Ca-alginate gel layer were calculated from the material properties of the fouling layer. Incomplete catalase retention highlighted the likely heterogeneity in size of liquid transport pathways. Adsorption also contributed to the trapping of colloidal particles according to the retention behaviour of BSA by the Ca-alginate gel layer. Gel layer formation propensity should be seriously considered for the operation of <b>membrane</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>processes.</b> Two simple methods based on (i) a permeability recovery experiment and (ii) comparison of dead-end filtration behaviour with and without shear application are proposed for evaluation of the gelling propensity of colloidal dispersions. © 2008 Elsevier B.

Given that this water technology may be conducted with different types of waters, we focused on investigating the effects of ionic strength on MS 2 behavior. For this, MS 2 was analyzed while suspended in solutions of various ionic strengths, first in a batch experiment and second during membrane ultrafiltration, and quantified using (i) quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), which detects {{the total number of}} viral genomes, (ii) qRT-PCR without the RNA extraction step, which reflects only particles with a broken capsid (free RNA), and (iii) the PFU method, which detects only infectious viruses. At the beginning of the batch experiments using solutions containing small amounts of salts, losses of MS 2 infectivity (90 %) and broken particles (20 %) were observed; these proportions did not change during filtration. In contrast, in high-ionic-strength solutions, bacteriophage kept its biological activity under static conditions, but it quickly lost its infectivity during the <b>filtration</b> <b>process.</b> Increasing the ionic strength decreased both the inactivation and the capsid breakup in the feed suspension and increased the loss of infectivity in the filtration retentate, while the numbers of MS 2 genomes were identical in both experiments.
