He also wrote the preface to physician and scientist William Gilbert's great work De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure (The Magnet, Magnetic Bodies, and the Great Magnet the Earth, 1600), in which Gilbert described his experiments which led {{to the conclusion that the}} Earth was magnetic, and introduced the term electricus to describe the phenomenon of static electricity produced by rubbing amber (called ēlectrum in Classical Latin, derived from ήλεκτρον (elektron) in Ancient Greek). According to the mathematician and physician Mark Ridley, chapter 12 of book 4 of De Magnete, which explained how astronomical observations could be used to determine the <b>magnetic</b> <b>variation,</b> was actually Wright's work.|$|E

500|$|Not {{long after}} 1600 Wright was {{appointed}} as surveyor to the New River project, which successfully directed {{the course of}} a new man-made channel to bring clean water from Ware, Hertfordshire, to Islington, London. Around this time, Wright also lectured mathematics to merchant seamen, and from 1608 or 1609 was mathematics tutor to the son of James I, the heir apparent Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, until the latter's very early death at the age of 18 in 1612. A skilled designer of mathematical instruments, Wright made models of an astrolabe and a pantograph, and a type of armillary sphere for Prince Henry. In the 1610 edition of Certaine Errors he described inventions such as the [...] "sea-ring" [...] that enabled mariners to determine the <b>magnetic</b> <b>variation</b> of the compass, the sun's altitude and the time of day in any place if the latitude was known; and a device for finding latitude when one was not on the meridian using the height of the pole star.|$|E

2500|$|He experimented on {{terrestrial}} magnetism {{and had taken}} part in medical experiments while at Wadham College, performing the first successful injection of a substance into the bloodstream (of a dog). In Gresham College, he did experiments involving determining longitude through <b>magnetic</b> <b>variation</b> and through lunar observation to help with navigation, and helped construct a [...] telescope with Sir Paul Neile. Wren also studied and improved the microscope and telescope at this time. He had also been making observations of the planet Saturn from around 1652 {{with the aim of}} explaining its appearance. His hypothesis was written up in De corpore saturni but before the work was published, Huygens presented his theory of the rings of Saturn. Immediately Wren recognised this as a better hypothesis than his own and De corpore saturni was never published. In addition, he constructed an exquisitely detailed lunar model and presented it to the king. Also his contribution to mathematics should be noted; in 1658, he found the length of an arc of the cycloid using an exhaustion proof based on dissections to reduce the problem to summing segments of chords of a circle which are in geometric progression.|$|E

With a tape he took measurements of the cabin site; of the distance from the wall of chaparral to the road; of the height of the chaparral bushes; also various other measurements.

30|$|From the {{scientific}} and technological aspect, GIC studies are interdisciplinary and include research in Earth’s electromagnetism, magnetospheric and ionospheric physics, interplanetary physics, and solar physics. The GIC {{is determined by the}} geomagnetically induced electric field (GIE) and the DC characteristics of the electric power grid. GIEs are controlled by <b>magnetic</b> <b>variations</b> in the ground and the Earth’s resistivity. Ground <b>magnetic</b> <b>variations</b> are composed of <b>magnetic</b> <b>variations</b> caused by magnetospheric and ionospheric disturbances and by currents induced in the ground. The magnetospheric disturbances in turn are driven by coronal mass ejections and other solar disturbances transmitted through interplanetary space. Furthermore, the effective application of a GIC study (e.g., disaster mitigation) requires assessment of how large and how often severe GICs occur in a specific area. Thus, the frequency of severe space weather events also needs to be characterized. At the same time, the heterogeneous distribution of the ground resistivity is important to assess local enhancements of the GIE. Scientists try to understand extreme space weather and predict a realistic GIC, and this special issue of 19 papers publishes recent research achievements about extremely severe space weather and the GIC in the realistic heterogeneous ground resistivity structure.|$|R
