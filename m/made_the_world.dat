5|$|As with {{previous}} Fire Emblem games, Path of Radiance {{takes place in}} a continuity and setting separate {{from the rest of the}} series. The game's setting is the continent of Tellius, inhabited by two species: the humanoid Beorc, and the shape-shifting Laguz. According to legend, the goddess who <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> created Beorc in her image, and created the Laguz to fill the gap between herself and beasts. The two races have struggled to coexist, leading to racial tensions and conflict on both sides. By the events of Path of Radiance, Tellius is divided into seven nations which remain at peace. A key item in Tellius is Lehran's Medallion, the world's incarnation of the recurring Fire Emblem. It is a bronze medallion said to contain a dark deity who brought chaos to the world 800 years before and caused all the world but Tellius to be engulfed by the sea. To prevent the dark god being freed, war must be prevented in Tellius.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} {{elements of}} the ceiling illustrate that God <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> as a perfect creation and put humanity into it, that humanity fell into disgrace and was punished by death and by separation from God. Humanity then sank further into sin and disgrace, and was punished by the Great Flood. Through a lineage of Ancestors – from Abraham to Joseph – God sent the saviour of humanity, Christ Jesus. The coming of the Saviour was prophesied by Prophets of Israel and Sibyls of the Classical world. The various components of the ceiling are linked to this Christian doctrine. Traditionally, the Old Testament was perceived as a prefiguring of the New Testament. Many incidents and characters of the Old Testament were commonly understood as having a direct symbolic link to some particular aspect {{of the life of}} Jesus or to an important element of Christian doctrine or to a sacrament such as Baptism or the Eucharist. Jonah, for example, was readily recognisable by his attribute of the large fish and was commonly seen to symbolise Jesus' death and resurrection.|$|E

25|$|What {{is known}} of the Cathars largely comes in what is {{preserved}} by the critics in the Catholic Church which later destroyed them in the Albigensian Crusade. Alain de Lille, c.1195, accused the Cathars of believing in two gods - one of light, one of darkness. Durand de Huesca, responding to a Cathar tract c.1220 indicates that they regarded the physical world as the creation of Satan. A former Italian Cathar turned Dominican, Sacchoni in 1250 testified to the Inquisition that his former co-religionists believed that the devil <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and everything in it.|$|E

At this time, Machito was at Fort Dix (New Jersey) in his fourth week of basic training. The day before at La Conga Club, Mario Bauzá, Machito's trumpeter and music director, heard pianist Luis Varona and bassist Julio Andino play El Botellero composition and arrangements of the Cuban-born Gilberto Valdez which {{would serve as a}} permanent sign off (end the dance) tune.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, the New York Yankees <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Series for the 15th time in 18 years – however Mel Allen was not there. In September of that year, {{before the}} end of the season, the Yankees {{informed}} Allen that his contract with the team would not be renewed. As been frequently mentioned, in those days, the main announcers for the Series participants always called the World Series on NBC. Although Allen was therefore technically eligible to call the Series, Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick honored the Yankees' request to have Phil Rizzuto join the Series crew instead. It was the first time Allen had missed a World Series for which the Yankees were eligible since 1943, and only the second World Series (not counting those missed during World War II) that he had missed since he began calling baseball games in 1938. On December 17, after much media speculation and many letters to the Yankees from fans disgruntled at Allen's absence from the Series, the Yankees issued a terse press release announcing Allen's firing; he was replaced by Joe Garagiola. NBC and Movietone dropped him soon afterward. To this day, the Yankees have never given an explanation for Allen's sudden firing, and rumors abounded. Depending on the rumor, Allen was either homosexual, an alcoholic, a drug addict or had a nervous breakdown. Allen's sexuality was sometimes a target in those more conservative days because he had not married (and never did). Years later, Allen told author Curt Smith that the Yankees had fired him under pressure from the team's longtime sponsor, Ballantine Beer. According to Allen, he was fired as a cost-cutting move by Ballantine, which had been experiencing poor sales for years (it would eventually be sold in 1969). Smith, in his book Voices of Summer, also indicated that the medications Allen took in order to maintain his busy schedule may have affected his on-air performance (Stephen Borelli, another biographer, has also pointed out that Allen's heavy workload did not allow him time to take care of his health).|$|E

500|$|To {{coincide}} with the centennial of Canadian Confederation, the three-tiered order was established in 1967 as a fellowship that recognizes the outstanding merit or distinguished service of Canadians who make a major difference to Canada through lifelong contributions in every field of endeavour, {{as well as the}} efforts by non-Canadians who have <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> better by their actions. Membership is accorded to those who exemplify the order's Latin motto, , meaning [...] "they desire a better country", a phrase taken from Hebrews 11:16.

500|$|Arthur Vaughan Williams died {{suddenly}} in February 1875, and his widow took {{the children to}} live in her family home, Leith Hill Place, Wotton, Surrey.

500|$|Makeba {{was among}} the most visible people campaigning against the {{apartheid}} system in South Africa, and was responsible for popularising several anti-apartheid songs, including [...] "Meadowlands" [...] by Strike Vilakezi and [...] "Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd" [...] (Watch out, Verwoerd) by Vuyisile Mini. Due to her high profile, she became a spokesperson of sorts for Africans living under oppressive governments, and in particular for black South Africans living under apartheid. When the South African government prevented her from entering her home country, she became a symbol of [...] "apartheid's cruelty", and she used her position as a celebrity by testifying against apartheid before the UN in 1962 and 1964. Many of her songs were banned within South Africa, leading to Makeba's records being distributed underground, and even her apolitical songs being seen as subversive. She thus became a symbol of resistance to the white minority government both within and outside South Africa. In an interview in 2000, Masekela said that [...] "there [...] nobody in Africa who <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> more aware of what was happening in South Africa than Miriam Makeba." ...|$|E

[...] Christgau went on to praise the track's hooks, and explained: [...] "The hooks, of course, are one reason hard die-hards put her down—in the truimpant Dirty South manner, her hip-hop is radio-friendly {{as a matter of}} principle. The cumulative weight of the long-player they never think about." [...] Monica Herrera of Rolling Stone called the song [...] "a bombshell-next-door move that demands attention". Matt Orkine of Triple J listed it as the year's ninth best single, and viewed it as a [...] "straight-up banger" [...] and his [...] "guiltiest music pleasure of 2013". Kellan Miller of XXL deemed it [...] "the song that <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> fall in love with Iggy all over again". Justin Monroe of Complex called it the album's [...] "infectious and decidedly less weird first single", and complimented its ability to provide listeners with a sense of Azalea's background.

500|$|Any of {{the three}} levels of the Order of Canada are open to all living Canadian citizens, except all federal and provincial {{politicians}} and judges while they hold office. The order recognizes the achievement of outstanding merit or distinguished service by Canadians who made a major difference to Canada through lifelong contributions in every field of endeavour, {{as well as the}} efforts made by non-Canadians who have <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> better by their actions. Membership is thus accorded to those who exemplify the order's Latin motto, taken from [...] of the Bible, desiderantes meliorem patriam, meaning [...] "they desire a better country." [...] Each of the six to eight hundred nominations submitted each year, by any person or organization, is received by the order's Advisory Council, which, along with the governor general, makes the final choice of new inductees, typically by consensus rather than a vote; a process that, when conceived, was {{the first of its kind}} in the world. Appointees are then accepted into the organization at an investiture ceremony typically conducted by the governor general at Rideau Hall, although the Queen or a provincial viceroy may perform the task, and the ceremony may take place in other locations. Since the 1991 investiture of Ted Rogers, Order of Canada instalment ceremonies have been broadcast on various television channels and the Internet; recipients are given a complimentary video recording of their investiture ceremony from Rogers Cable.|$|E
