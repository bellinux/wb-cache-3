50|$|The Federal {{government}} expropriated the Maple Leaf {{complex in}} 1972 {{as part of}} the Harbourfront scheme. Unlike the fate of the Victory Soya Mills <b>Silos</b> and Canada <b>Malting</b> <b>Silos,</b> the Maple Leaf Silos were demolished in the 1983 in the haste to remove the industrial eyesore and blight along the waterfront. Demolition took a full year, cost $1 million, and bankrupted the Thunder Bay wrecking company.|$|R
5000|$|Canada <b>Malting</b> <b>Silos</b> {{is one of}} two {{remaining}} silos in Toronto's Harbourfront in Ontario, Canada. Located at the foot of Bathurst Street at Bathurst Quay (Eireann Quay), the silos were built in 1928 to store malt for the Canada Malting Company. It was an important work of industrial architecture, as grain elevators had long been built out of wood, and thus were at great danger of fire. The concrete malting towers were an innovation, and the stark functionalism of the prominent building was an early influence on modernist architecture. [...] A round office was added in 1944 and glass office was built in the original construction in 1928. The main silos, 15 in all, are 120 feet (37 meters) high and additional storage bins built in 1944 are 150 feet (46 meters) high.|$|R
5000|$|The Canada <b>Malting</b> <b>Silos</b> {{along the}} {{waterfront}} at {{the western edge of}} Harbourfront, are one of the last vestiges of the industrial past of the neighbourhood. The buildings were long ago abandoned by the company that built them, but a proposal for demolition was cancelled when the estimated cost for demolition rose into the millions of dollars. The site is also now considered a heritage site, and any development must conserve some aspect of the industrial past. Two proposals have been made, a Canadian music museum and a Toronto history museum have both been proposed for the site. Both proposals keep the silos, but demolish other buildings on the site. The silos are one two remaining silos in the area (see Victory Soya Mills Silos) and reminder of the past uses of the area.|$|R
50|$|Ireland Park {{is located}} on the shores of Lake Ontario on Éireann Quay, {{adjoining}} the Canada <b>Malting</b> <b>Silos,</b> at the foot of Bathurst Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Officially opened in the summer of 2007, Ireland Park commemorates the tens of thousands who fled Ireland during the Great Famine. In 1847 over 38,000 Irish men, women and children landed on the shores of Toronto, where Ireland Park now stands, fleeing famine and eager to start a new life. Although Toronto only had 20,000 inhabitants, the city welcomed the newcomers with open arms. Over 1,100 new immigrants did not survive to make Canada their new home, with many perishing in fever sheds during the Typhus epidemic of 1847. Ireland Park is a tribute to all the Irish ancestors who came with only hope, for a new life in a promising country.|$|R
50|$|To {{the east}} of Exhibition Place begins {{a long stretch of}} former {{commercial}} and industrial areas that are rapidly being converted into some of Toronto's most expensive residences and condominiums. Historic commercial structures such as the Tip Top Tailors Building and the Queen's Quay Terminal have been turned into luxury condominiums with waterfront views. Associated with this Queens Quay has become home to a number of high end shops and restaurants. This area is also home to the Harbourfront Centre, a large cultural centre occupying 10 acre of former industrial land including an old power plant that is now a gallery. Some large industrial structures remain though most are shut down, most prominently the imposing Canada <b>Malting</b> <b>Silos.</b> Just {{to the north of the}} Gardiner is the former railway lands that have also seen rapid development in the years since deindustrialization. This area is home to the Rogers Centre (SkyDome) and CN Tower, both of which are prominently visible from the waterfront.|$|R
2500|$|On October 16, Toronto City Council voted 9–8 {{to approve}} the Hall plan instead of giving up the airport to provincial or federal control. [...] The bridge to the airport was {{approved}} on condition its construction did not use City tax dollars on the bridge or its financing. An environmental assessment at first proposed a $14 million bridge along {{the east side of}} the Canada <b>Malting</b> Co. <b>silos,</b> but ultimately a bridge at the foot of Bathurst Street was chosen at a cost of $10 million.|$|R
5000|$|The Nylex Clock is {{an iconic}} neon sign sitting atop <b>malting</b> storage <b>silos</b> in the suburb of Cremorne, Victoria, Australia. It is located {{adjacent}} to the northern bank of the Yarra River and the Monash Freeway and displays the time and temperature alternately. The text also alternates displaying the words 'Nylex Plastics' that changes to 'Nylex Every Time!'. It is visible from many parts of Melbourne, particularly the Melbourne Cricket Ground. This linkage is {{referred to in the}} song [...] "Leaps and Bounds" [...] by musician Paul Kelly.|$|R
5000|$|... "A {{tour of the}} {{building}} {{is a very interesting}} as well as an instructive undertaking. The visitor who is taken to follow the natural course of the grain through its various processes, first visits four large malting rooms, each of which possess a flooring capacity for 600 to 800 measures of grain. The floor is of concrete, and everything necessary to the operation is supplied in what might be almost called lavish abundance. The grain which has been converted into malt is stored in <b>malt</b> <b>silos,</b> huge chambers specially prepared for its reception and where it waits until it is wanted. At proper time the malt is conveyed by mechanical means to the various floors where it is needed, no hand being necessary to touch a grain. After undergoing a number of processes, the brew-house is arrived at, and the mashing of the malt and the boiling of the wort is carried on under the eye of the experienced brewer, or as the Germans call him, the braumeister, Mr Philip Lorentz. During the time of the writer's visit the contents of the mash tun were being drawn off, and after careful examination, and much testing, discharged into the copper, where, by means of dry steam, the necessary heat is obtained for the further processes. The visitor is struck by the scrupulous cleanliness observed, as well as the copper fittings which are all carefully tinned to preserve the liquor from contamination. The writer paid a visit to the cooler, which is of large capacity, and possesses a fan in its centre which is revolved in order to procure a constant current of cold air."
