In the Coronation Street: Romanian Holiday film, Roy and Hayley Cropper are filmed {{in front of a}} Harveys store. In Coronation Street: A Knights Tale, a Harveys truck can be seen driving past Mary Taylor's <b>motor-home</b> to further promote the brand. On 11 April 2012, it was announced that Harveys had decided not to renew their contract and ceased sponsorship in December 2012. Compare The Market were named as the new sponsor.|$|E

2500|$|Burgess was a Conservative (though, as he {{clarified}} in {{an interview}} with The Paris Review, his political views could be considered [...] "a kind of anarchism" [...] since his ideal of a [...] "Catholic Jacobite imperial monarch" [...] wasn't practicable), a (lapsed) Catholic and Monarchist, harbouring a distaste for all republics. He believed that socialism for the most part was [...] "ridiculous" [...] but did [...] "concede that socialized medicine is a priority in any civilized country today." [...] To avoid the 90% tax the family would have incurred because of their high income, they left Britain and toured Europe in a Bedford Dormobile <b>motor-home.</b> During their travels through France and across the Alps, Burgess wrote {{in the back of the}} van as Liana drove. In this period, he wrote novels and produced film scripts for Lew Grade and Franco Zeffirelli. His first place of residence after leaving England was Lija, Malta (1968–70). The negative reaction from a lecture that Burgess delivered to an audience of Catholic priests in Malta precipitated a move by the couple to Italy. The Burgesses maintained a flat in Rome, a country house in Bracciano, and a property in Montalbuccio. On hearing rumours of a mafia plot to kidnap Paolo-Andrea while the family was staying in Rome, Burgess decided to move to Monaco in 1975. Burgess was also motivated to move to the tax haven of Monaco as the country did not levy income tax and widows were exempt from death duties, a form of taxation on their husband's estates.|$|E

5000|$|Sportsmobile is {{a company}} that {{provides}} custom after market conversions for full size vans. Most vans are fully converted to type B RV <b>motor-homes.</b> The Sportsmobile company was founded in 1961 by Charles Borskey [...] and now has three locations: Huntington, Indiana, Austin, Texas and Fresno, California. They are considered one of the oldest van conversion companies in the U.S.|$|R
5000|$|Double Arrow Engineering's WildFire Heat Recovery System (WFHRS) is {{underdevelopment}} and utilizes wasted {{heat from}} both coolant and exhaust. This system mechanically adds power {{back to the}} drive-line, utilizing a Rankine engine as the energy conversion method.

5000|$|Tourism {{has been}} slow to develop. [...] there are no hotels, two or three bed and breakfast establishments, and until {{recently}} few self-catering cottages or houses. Since the completion in 2001 of the causeway to South Uist and the inauguration of the vehicle ferry to Barra, a number of properties have been professionally renovated or purpose-built as holiday accommodation. The machair and beaches from Coilleag a' Phrionnsa to Rudha Bàn are increasingly popular with visitors travelling with their <b>motor-homes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Hilux was radically {{redesigned}} in 1975 to {{be larger}} and with increased standard equipment. In North America the new version also meant {{the introduction of the}} considerably larger (2.2 L) 20R engine and the SR5 upscale trim package. A five-speed manual transmission became optional. In North America, the Hilux name was fully phased out in favor of [...] "Truck" [...] by that year, having been dropped from brochures and advertising starting in 1973. Some North American motor-coach manufacturers began building Toyota <b>motor-homes</b> with this chassis.|$|R
50|$|There are {{few places}} {{left in the}} world where housetrucking can be an {{uninhibited}} lifestyle with the kinds of simple homemade rigs New Zealand boasts. In other countries stringent laws regarding the roadworthy standards of older vehicles have forced many old housetrucks and buses from the roads and into graveyards of isolated farm paddocks and wrecking yards. Other laws concerning where one may park or camp have seriously restricted life on the road. The Kiwi housetrucker, living within a culture which popularizes the benefits of preserving these old motor relics, appreciates their truckers' haven. That New Zealand transport law requires that all vehicles submit to a thorough mechanical Warrant of Fitness every six months ensures that these old <b>motor-homes</b> remain roadworthy.|$|R

5000|$|A britzka (also spelled brichka or britska) {{is a type}} of horse-drawn {{carriage}}. It was a long, spacious carriage {{with four}} wheels, as well as a folding top over the rear seat and a rear-facing front seat. Pulled by two horses, it had a place in the front for a driver. It was constructed as to give space for reclining at night when used on a journey. Its size made it suitable for use as a 19th-century equivalent to a <b>motor-home,</b> as it could be adapted with all manner of conveniences (beds, dressing tables etc.) for the traveler.|$|E
5000|$|The Riverside poker room is smoke-free {{and has a}} large {{rear window}} with a vista of the Colorado river and nearby mountains. The cash games are frequented by a few local players, but mostly they are {{occupied}} by <b>motor-home</b> driving retirees visiting Laughlin for the weekend. The $15 buy-in poker tournaments that Riverside holds 3 times daily are shoot-outs that last one hour (timed), which makes them super-aggressive [...] "All-in" [...] festivals. Players must choose their starting hands carefully in these tournaments because they {{must be prepared to}} call an all-in on the majority of hands, especially in the last 15-20 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Davies {{subsequently}} {{moved to}} Albuquerque, New Mexico, {{where he lived}} in a <b>motor-home</b> and worked in the construction industry. He lost touch with many of his former playing colleagues. Contact was re-established in 2006 when there were discussions of an appeal for support to enable him to have a hip replacement. He said that his hip had been damaged due to the wear and tear of his playing days and that he could not afford the necessary surgery and would soon have to stop working. The appeal organised on his behalf by fans of Southampton was successful, enabling him to have two hip replacements and providing a surplus for his general use. However, following the death of his American partner, Chris, in 2009 he once again became reclusive.|$|E
5000|$|In the Giro d'Italia, Porte made {{headlines}} {{by having a}} <b>motor-home</b> to sleep in as he was the team leader while his teammates slept in hotels. He was competitive {{during the first week}} of the race, and sat third overall after stage nine. However, on Stage 10 Porte punctured 5 km from the finish, and accepted a change of wheels from Simon Clarke from the [...] team. Porte initially lost 47 seconds to the peloton, but was then docked two minutes and fined 200 Swiss francs for accepting Clarke's wheel as this manoeuvre is illegal according to UCI rules, dropping him to 12th place overall. On stage 13, Porte was involved in a crash 3.3 km from the stage finish, and lost a further two minutes. Porte suffered a bad individual time trial on stage 14 and an even worse stage 15, where he lost 27 minutes to then-leader Alberto Contador. After that debacle, he gave the leadership of the team to Leopold König. After the aforementioned stage, he announced he was abandoning the race due to a leg injury.|$|E
5000|$|Spyderco {{was founded}} by Sal Glesser. (The name Spyderco was named after Sal noticed that many high {{performance}} sports cars had 'Spyder' in the name, this in turn created the name Spyderco to signify high performance cutting tools.) The first product Spyderco produced was the Portable Hand in 1976, this [...] "spider-shaped device", {{was a series of}} angles, ball joints and alligator clips that helped people such as jewelers and hobbyists to work with small parts. Spyderco's Founder, Sal Glesser, and his wife Gail, converted an old bread delivery truck into a <b>motor-home</b> and traveled to shows. As they became more successful, they graduated from the bread truck to a truck and trailer. They settled in Golden in November 1978. Spyderco began producing knife sharpeners in 1978 and produced their first folding knife, the C01 Worker, in 1981. This knife was the first to feature a round hole in the blade designed for fast, one-handed and ambidextrous opening, which is now the company's trademark. Additionally, the company claims that this was the first knife to feature a pocket clip {{on the right side of}} the handle.|$|E
