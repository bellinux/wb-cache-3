5|$|Royal {{concerns}} over security led to Henry II investing heavily {{in a new}} castle structure on the site between 1171 and 1174. It was unusual for a new royal castle {{to be built in}} this part of England during the 12th century, and Henry appears to have been driven by the military threat from Scotland before and during the Great Revolt of 1173 to 1174. Henry II spent almost £600 on the castle between 1170 and 1187, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the first few years, rebuilding the older structure {{under the supervision of the}} Count of Brittany's local tenants, Torfin, Osbert and Stephen of Barningham.|$|E

5|$|Rum-runners {{used the}} Everglades as a hiding spot during Prohibition; {{it was so}} vast there were never enough law {{enforcement}} officers to patrol it. The arrival of the railroad, and the discovery that adding trace elements like copper was the remedy for crops sprouting and dying quickly, soon created a population boom. New towns such as Moore Haven, Clewiston, and Belle Glade sprouted like the crops. Sugarcane became the primary crop grown in South Florida. Miami experienced a second real estate boom that earned a developer in Coral Gables $150million. Undeveloped land north of Miami sold for $30,600 an acre. In 1925, Miami newspapers published editions weighing over , <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> real estate advertising. Waterfront property was the most highly valued. Mangrove trees were cut down and replaced with palm trees to improve the view. Acres of South Florida slash pine were cleared.

5|$|The {{excavations}} {{also revealed}} stones or fragments of carved stone {{dating from the}} 12th to the 16thcenturies. The earliest are in Romanesque style and include two voussoirs decorated with beakheads (grotesque animal heads with long pointed bird-like beaks). Other stones dating from the 12thcentury are in Gothic style; they include a capital decorated with leaves and {{a portion of the}} tracery from a rose window. Many of the stones from the 13thcentury were originally part of the cloister arcade, and had been re-used to form the core of a later cloister arcade. They include stones sculpted with depictions of humans and animals. The best preserved of these are the heads of two canons, each wearing a cowl with the tonsure visible, the head of a woman with shoulder-length hair, parts of a seated figure holding an open book, and a creature that might represent a serpent or an otter. There are numerous fragments dating from the 14th and 15thcenturies. These include portions of string courses, tracery, corbels, window jambs, and arch heads. At least three of the corbels were carved in the form of human heads. Over 1,500fragments of painted medieval glass were found, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a poor condition. These show that the glazing scheme used in the priory was mainly in grisaille (monochrome) style. Almost 1,300fragments of glass from later periods, and nearly 1,150sherds of ceramic roof tiles were also found.|$|E

25|$|Nicknamed “Cornfield High” when it opened, Broad Run’s facilities, academics, and extracurricular environments {{have always}} been {{challenged}} by its location {{in one of the}} fastest-growing counties in the United States. In 1969, Loudoun County opened its third public high school amidst corn fields in Ashburn to accommodate the growing student populations resulting from new housing developments in the unincorporated communities in the eastern half of the county. Since then, the county population has increased nearly sevenfold (<b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the east), straining education budgets, infrastructure, and local politics. For Ashburn, this has resulted in constantly shifting attendance boundaries as new schools are constantly being opened, at all levels, elementary, middle, and high. The area’s student demographics have significantly changed as well: Loudoun County’s residents are now the country’s most affluent (per capita), and its ethnic composition continues to diversify as foreign immigration into Northern Virginia increases.|$|E
25|$|He was re-elected in single-candidate {{elections}} in 1977 and 1984.

This was almost equivalent to the country's foreign debt at the time, and, by 1989, the government was forced to default on international loans from Belgium. He owned a fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles that he used to travel between his numerous palaces, while the nation's roads rotted and many of his people starved. Infrastructure virtually collapsed, and many public service workers went months without being paid. Most of the money was siphoned off to Mobutu, his family, and top political and military leaders. Only the Special Presidential Division – on whom his physical safety depended – was paid adequately or regularly. A popular saying that the civil servants pretended to work while the state pretended to pay them expressed this grim reality.|$|E

25|$|Ahead {{of their}} first season in the top division, and in {{anticipation}} of increased attendances, the club began work on a grandstand and relaid the pitch. Over the next few years, they purchased the remaining eleven years of the lease on the Coventry Road ground, and bought the grandstand from Aston Villa's Wellington Road ground {{to use as a}} terrace cover, providing more covered standing accommodation. Despite the misgivings of the Daily Post that the squad was too small, the team finished 12th of 16. They opened the 1895–96 campaign with six defeats, spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the bottom two places, conceded more goals than any other team in the division for the second consecutive season, and scored fewer than all but bottom club West Bromwich Albion. The directors were criticised for failing to improve the team and for their selection policy: making too many changes to the team from one game to the next, and playing men when they were unfit. A draw from the final match of the season, at home to Sunderland, would have secured their First Division status for another year, but they lost, finished 15th of the 16 teams, and were relegated. Following the relegation, Fred Wheldon, who had scored 116 goals from 175 matches in league and FA Cup, left for League champions Aston Villa for a fee of £350, which was reported to be a national record.|$|E
