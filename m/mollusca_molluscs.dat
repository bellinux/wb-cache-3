50|$|Apart {{from the}} <b>Mollusca</b> (<b>molluscs),</b> Linnaeus {{included}} a very diverse and rather mismatched assemblage {{of animals in}} the categories. The Intestina group encompassed various parasitic animals, among them the hagfish, which Linnaeus would have found in dead fish. Shelled molluscs {{were placed in the}} Testacea, together with barnacles and tube worms. Cnidarians (jellyfish and corals), echinoderms and polychaetes were spread across the other orders. After Linnaeus, and especially with the advent of Darwinism, it became apparent {{that a lot of the}} Vermes-animals are not at all closely related. Historically, systematic works on phylum-level taxa since Linnaeus have largely been about splitting up Vermes and sorting the animals into natural systematic units. The first major revision was done by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in his 1801 Système des Animaux sans Vertebres. In this work, he categorized echinoderms, arachnids, crustaceans and annelids, which he separated from Vermes. The work Lamarck started still goes on today.|$|E

50|$|Other aquatic {{invertebrates}} such as most <b>molluscs</b> (<b>Mollusca)</b> and larger crustaceans (Crustacea) such as lobsters, have gills analogous {{to those of}} fish, which operate in a similar way.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the classes}} of Vermes {{proposed}} by Linnaeus, only <b>Mollusca</b> (the <b>molluscs)</b> has been kept as a phylum, and its composition has changed almost entirely. Though we today may view Linnaeus's early classification of the soft-bodied organisms as rather primitive, it was revolutionary in its day. A {{number of the}} organisms classified as Vermes by Linnaeus were very poorly known, {{and a number of}} them were not even viewed as animals.|$|R
5000|$|Malacology is {{the branch}} of {{invertebrate}} zoology that deals with {{the study of the}} <b>Mollusca</b> (mollusks or <b>molluscs),</b> the second-largest phylum of animals in terms of described species after the arthropods. Mollusks include snails and slugs, clams, octopus and squid, and numerous other kinds, many (but by no means all) of which have shells. One division of malacology, conchology, is devoted to the study of mollusk shells. Malacology derives from Greek , malakos, [...] "soft"; and , -logia.|$|R
40|$|Contribution to {{the study}} of {{terrestrial}} <b>molluscs</b> (<b>Mollusca,</b> Gastropoda) Serralada LitoralPark (Barcelona) The population of molluscs in Serralada Litoral Park (Barcelona, NE Iberian peninsula) was assessed, contributing to the conservation plan. A wildlife inventory was conducted based on fieldwork and literature. Gastropod communities in various natural environments and conchological species of interest for conservation are also described. Several environmental aspects that determine the distribution and abundance of snails are discussed and management measures to meet their ecological requirements are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Overwintering {{habits of}} the land snail Vertigo angustior (<b>Mollusca)</b> During a <b>mollusc</b> survey in 2004 en 2005 in the {{province}} of Zuid-Holland special attention was paid to Vertigo angustior. The species was observed overwintering in large groups, up to hundreds of specimens together, between mosses (especially Brachythecium rutabulum (Hedw.) Schimp.) in small patches of poplar forest (Populus nigra and Populus alba) in the old dunes. As far as we know, this gregarious behaviour is described here for the first time. Many of the snails were found {{in a position where they}} had incorporated a moss leaf into the epiphragm closing the shell’s aperture, thereby achoring themselves to the vegetation, possibly for stability...|$|R
40|$|Taxonomic {{capacity}} {{in the developing world}} is seriously lacking, and as such species identification for both pests and useful species is seriously hampered. Some of these species are key indicators of environmental health and climatic changes, and as such call for continuous and informed monitoring. From the developing world point of view, several useful indicators can be listed for lifecycle assessment. However, such would be limited to taxa that have experts and have been researched on and documented in the region. Such indicators as spiders (Araneae), terrestrial <b>molluscs</b> (<b>Mollusca),</b> bees (Apidae) and beetles (Coleoptera) and their value as indicators are discussed. Measurements of environmental damage and resultant loss of biodiversity, both at the species level (micro) and at the landscape level (macro) as a key baseline for decision making in environmental planning and management form part of the taxonomic mandate. One component of the life cycle assessment, beyond the biodiversity and ecosystem health analysis, therefore must address landscape level impacts. From a developing world perspective, this must involve evolving a toolkit for assessing the economic values of biodiversity and land use impact, including human health and food security. Species stock-dynamics, such as availability, ranking and user-preferences, and human/scientific perspective...|$|R
