40|$|International audienceWe present exact {{three-dimensional}} semi-analytical ex- pressions of {{the force}} exerted between two coaxial thick coils with rect- angular cross-sections. Then, we present a semi-analytical formulation of their mutual inductance. For this purpose, we have to calculate six and seven integrations for calculating <b>the</b> force <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mutual induc- tance respectively. After mathematical manipulations, we can obtain semi-analytical formulations based on only two integrations. It is to be noted that such integrals can be evaluated numerically as they are smooth and derivable. Then, we compare our results with <b>the</b> ¯la- <b>ment</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ¯nite element methods. All the results are in excellent agreement...|$|R

Our results suggest that Milky Way type systems tend to evolve passively with time without su ering signi cant mass accretion. The chemical e richment of these systems seems to be driven mainly by gas cooling, star formation eFFIciency <b>and</b> for <b>the</b> most massive progenitors by AGN feedback...|$|R
40|$|Designing {{a mobile}} robotic toy is {{challenging}} work. The robot must be appealing {{to children and}} create interesting interactions while facing {{the wide variety of}} situations that can be expe- rienced while playing with a child, and all at a reasonable cost. In this paper we present Roball, a ball-shaped robot that moves by making its external spherical shell rotate. Such design for a mobile robotic toy shows robustness in handling unstructured environments and unconstrained interactions with children. Results show that purposeful movements of the robot, its physical structure and locomotion dynamics generate interesting new games influenced by <b>the</b> environ- <b>ment</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> child...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between segregation of women across establish- <b>ments</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wages of males and females. To investigate this issue empirically we use a panel of matched employer-employee data from Brazil. Various longitudinal models are {{used to assess the}} wage impact of establishment gender segregation. Overall, the results indicate that the e ect of establishment female proportion on the wages of males and females is negative. We also compare these longitudinal results with cross-section estimates, which are the usual ones obtained in the related literature. This com- parison suggests that unmeasured, time-invariant worker- and establishment-speci c e ects are correlated with the establishment female composition...|$|R
