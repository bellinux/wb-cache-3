5|$|Most of the {{academic}} literature provides a basic framework for primate taxonomy, usually including several potential taxonomic schemes. Although <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> upon phylogeny, many disagree about nearly every level of primate classification.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of lemurs within the suborder Strepsirrhini is equally controversial, although <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> {{on the same}} phylogenetic tree. In one taxonomy, the infraorder Lemuriformes contains all living strepsirrhines in two superfamilies, Lemuroidea for all lemurs and Lorisoidea for the lorisoids (lorisids and galagos). Alternatively, the lorisoids are sometimes placed in their own infraorder, Lorisiformes, separate from the lemurs. In another taxonomy published by Colin Groves, the aye-aye was placed in its own infraorder, Chiromyiformes, {{while the rest of}} the lemurs were placed in Lemuriformes and the lorisoids in Lorisiformes.|$|E
25|$|Despite the mid-20th century failure, {{the idea}} of underriver tunnels, which is relied on much {{advanced}} metro technologies, is still on Kiev city planner's table. Tunnel projects are recently being included in some of proposed Kiev development plans {{as a way to}} move the main traffic flows in the city center underground. However, <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> that such projects are both unaffordable and technically infeasible at this time.|$|E
50|$|As many as 2 million nomadic Kuchis {{wandered over}} Afghanistan {{in the years}} before the Soviet invasion, and <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agreed</b> that by 2000 the number had fallen dramatically, perhaps by half. The severe drought had {{destroyed}} 80% of the livestock in some areas.|$|R
50|$|Mayorga {{started the}} fight by almost falling Trinidad with a jab. A famous {{part of this}} round sees Mayorga drop his hands {{sticking}} his chin in the air daring the vicious puncher Trinidad to try his best. Trinidad threw three left hooks and Mayorga simply did a mocking dance to taunt Trinidad. In round two, Trinidad and Mayorga traded power punches evenly, with <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agreeing</b> that Trinidad landed {{with a little more}} power.|$|R
50|$|The {{great loss}} of weight is {{to some extent}} {{accounted}} for by the fact that Voorzanger discovered several flaws, one especially big, that he found it necessary to cut away. Although Prince Albert was dissatisfied with such a huge reduction, <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agreed</b> that Voorzanger had made the right decision and carried out his job with impeccable skill. When Queen Victoria showed the re-cut diamond to the young Maharaja Duleep Singh, the Koh-i-Noor's last non-British owner, he was apparently unable to speak for several minutes afterwards.|$|R
25|$|Common {{symptoms}} {{associated with}} a diagnosis of PCS are related to cognition, attention, and memory, especially short-term memory, which can also worsen other problems such as forgetting appointments or difficulties at work. In one study, one in four people diagnosed with PCS continued to report memory problems {{a year after the}} injury, but <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> that cognitive symptoms clear within {{six months to a year}} after injury in the vast majority of individuals.|$|E
25|$|Platinum coins are {{a popular}} investment, {{and each year}} {{the number of such}} coins sold by Sberbank of Russia {{increases}} by 30–50%. <b>Most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> that such investments should have a long-term character, as the rise of the platinum price is relatively slow– about 80% over the last 5 years, except for a rapid rise followed by decline in 2008. Also, whereas most banks can sell platinum coins, only a few buy them, as this requires evaluation by an experienced professional. For example, only 5% of offices of Sberbank (the major bank of Russia) in the capital city of Moscow redeem precious metal coins. The selling price is also much affected by visible scratches, spots, patina, and other defects introduced by bad handling. For this reason, most bullion coins are sealed in transparent plastic right after removal from the press. They are then stored in a dry room with relative humidity below 80% and at temperatures between 15 and 40°C. If a coin is removed from its plastic seal, it is recommended not to store it in PVC albums, as PVC molecules gradually break down, releasing organochlorine compounds which produce patina on the coins. These compounds may also form acids by reacting with moisture. Unlike silver, platinum does not corrode. However, as is true for all unprotected coins, platinum coins are prone to contamination which can be caused even by washing with (chlorine-containing) tap water.|$|E
500|$|The {{destruction}} of Hood spurred a relentless pursuit by the Royal Navy involving dozens of warships. Two days later, heading for occupied France to effect repairs, Bismarck {{was attacked by}} 16 obsolescent Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier one scored a hit that rendered the battleship's steering gear inoperable. In her final battle the following morning, the already-crippled Bismarck was severely damaged during a sustained engagement with two British battleships and two heavy cruisers, [...] was scuttled by her crew, and sank with heavy loss of life. <b>Most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> that the battle damage would have caused her to sink eventually. The wreck was located in June 1989 by Robert Ballard, and has since been further surveyed by several other expeditions.|$|E
50|$|Although it was {{recorded}} in the historical document Chronicles of the Kikkawa Clan that the Population Census Edict was promulgated in 1591, more recent research has called this into question and <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> now <b>agree</b> on 1592 as the correct date.|$|R
2500|$|The 49ers had handily {{beaten the}} Bengals in a December game played in Cincinnati and {{consequently}} were installed as a 2-point favorite. That said, going into Super Bowl XVI, <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agreed</b> that both teams were very evenly matched, but many thought Pete Johnson's rushing ability {{could prove to}} be the difference. Some also pointed out that Ken Anderson was an established 11-year veteran who had just finished the best season of his career, while the young Montana was only just starting to emerge as a top-notch quarterback. [...] Furthermore, Anderson had advanced through the playoffs without throwing a single interception, while Montana had been intercepted 4 times, 3 of them occurring in the NFC title game.|$|R
50|$|Although many {{warn that}} static {{analysis}} alone {{should not be}} considered a silver bullet or panacea, <b>most</b> industry <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> that static analysis is a proven method for eliminating many security, reliability, and performance defects. In other words, while static analysis {{is not the same as}} development testing, it is commonly considered a component of development testing.|$|R
500|$|The {{aquarium}} {{should be}} decorated {{to mimic the}} natural environment and include rocks and artificial caves for breeding. <b>Most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> that a pair of convicts {{should be kept in}} a 20-gallon aquarium or larger. The species is an unfussy omnivore and most types of prepared fish foods are readily accepted. The species also consumes aquatic plants so plastic plants or robust plants such as java fern are recommended. [...] Convict cichlids are aggressively territorial during breeding and pairs are best kept alone. Brood care is reduced in aquarium strains. Due to the species' tendency to dig, external filtration is superior to undergravel filter systems. Its relatively small size, along with ease of keeping and breeding, make the convict an ideal cichlid for beginners and advanced aquarists alike interested in observing pair bonds and brood care.|$|E
2500|$|In the AD year {{numbering}} system, whether {{applied to}} the Julian or Gregorian calendars, AD 1 is preceded by 1 BC. There is no year [...] "0" [...] between them. Because of this, <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> that a new century begins in a year which has [...] "01" [...] as the final digits (e.g., 1801, 1901, 2001). New millennia likewise are considered to have begun in 1001 and 2001. This {{is at odds with}} the much more common conception that centuries and millennia begin when the trailing digits are zeroes (1800, 1900, 2000, etc.); for example, the worldwide celebration of the new millennium took place on New Year's Eve 1999, when the year number ticked over to 2000.|$|E
2500|$|One such {{composition}} {{included the}} observation, 'Nowhere have I seen such Lions led by such Lambs.' While the exact provenance of this quotation {{has been lost}} to history, <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> it was written during the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest clashes in modern warfare. While some military archivists credit the author as an anonymous infantryman, others argue that the source {{was none other than}} General Max von Gallwitz, Supreme Commander (sic) of the German forces. In either case, it is generally accepted to be a derivation of Alexander the Great’s proclamation, 'I am never afraid of an army of Lions led into battle by a Lamb. I fear more the army of Lambs who have a Lion to lead them.' ...|$|E
40|$|A speedy {{resolution}} of the long-standing dispute between China and Japan over {{the sovereignty of the}} Diaoyu Islands (Senkaku in Japanese) does not seem likely.

5000|$|Adam Linger is most {{known for}} being the long-snapper on the [...] "wide right" [...] field goal by Scott Norwood in Super Bowl XXV. <b>Most</b> {{football}} <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> that the snap on the play was perfect and not {{a factor in the}} kick being missed. Lingner is also one of only 22 players to play in all of the Buffalo Bills Super Bowl appearances in the early 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|Parking restrictions, making {{motor vehicle}} use less {{attractive}} {{by increasing the}} monetary and non-monetary costs of parking, introducing greater competition for limited city or road space. <b>Most</b> transport planning <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> that free parking distorts the market in favour of car travel, exacerbating congestion.|$|R
2500|$|By {{analogy with}} {{the health of the}} body, one can speak metaphorically of a state of health of the mind, or mental health. Merriam-Webster defines mental health as [...] "A state of {{emotional}} and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life." [...] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no one [...] "official" [...] definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how [...] "mental health" [...] is defined. In general, <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> that [...] "mental health" [...] and [...] "mental disorder" [...] are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.|$|E
6000|$|... b. The {{supposition}} that [...] "Matthew" [...] was {{acquainted with}} [...] "Luke," [...] or [...] "Luke" [...] with [...] "Matthew" [...] has equally grave implications. If that be so, {{the one who}} used the other could have had but a poor opinion of his predecessor's historical veracity. If, as <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree,</b> [...] "Luke" [...] is later than [...] "Matthew," [...] {{it is clear that}} he does not credit [...] "Matthew's" [...] account of the infancy; does not believe the [...] "Sermon on the Mount" [...] as given by Matthew was preached; does not believe in the two feeding miracles, to which Jesus himself is made to refer; wholly discredits [...] "Matthew's" [...] account of the events after the crucifixion; and thinks it not worth while to notice [...] "Matthew's" [...] grave admission that [...] "some doubted." ...|$|E

25|$|While <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agreed</b> that a torpedo had exploded, they {{differed}} on {{what caused}} the explosion. Many Russians {{did not believe that}} Kursk could be so easily sunk. The tragedy spawned a number of wild conspiracy theories to explain the disaster. One theory offered was an explosion located in the high-pressure air tanks used to blow the ballast tanks, located near the torpedo tubes. Mainstream publications like Der Spiegel, Berliner Zeitung, and the Sunday Times claimed to possess documentation proving that the submarine was struck by a missile fired by Pyotr Velikiy. This was the largest naval exercise that the Russian navy had conducted in more than a decade, which increased the chances of a friendly fire incident. Other theories included Chechen espionage, human error, sabotage, and that Kursk was testing a new top-secret torpedo, Shkval (Squall), capable of speeds in excess of , for which the Western navies have no defence. Another theory was that USS Memphis had fired a torpedo at Kursk.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{numerous}} widely acknowledged types of ellipsis. Nine {{of them are}} mentioned and briefly illustrated below: 1) gapping, 2) stripping, 3) VP-ellipsis, 4) pseudogapping, 5) answer fragments, 6) sluicing, 7) N-ellipsis, 8) comparative deletion, and 9) null complement anaphora. There is no unanimity among experts that all nine of the mechanisms should indeed qualify as ellipsis. <b>Most</b> <b>experts</b> would <b>agree,</b> however, {{that most of the}} nine are in fact ellipses. The discussion below takes their status as ellipses largely for granted.|$|R
50|$|Although it {{is still}} widely debated, certain types of green coffee are {{believed}} to improve with age; especially those that are valued for their low acidity, such as coffees from Indonesia or India. Several of these coffee producers sell coffee beans that have been aged {{for as long as}} 3 years, with some as long as 8 years. However, <b>most</b> coffee <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> that a green coffee peaks in flavor and freshness within one year of harvest, because over-aged coffee beans will lose much of their essential oil content.|$|R

50|$|<b>Most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> {{that the}} name is {{connected}} to modrá (blue). The name probably originates from another historic geographic name in the neighbourhood, e.g. Modrá hora (Blue Mountain). According to a less probable hypothesis, the name comes from madár (a bird).|$|E
50|$|<b>Most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> that babirusas {{are part}} of the pig family, and are one of the oldest living members of the family, {{representing}} a subfamily, Babyrousinae, that branched off from the warthog branch of the pig family (Subfamily Phacochoerini) during the Oligocene or early Miocene.|$|E
2500|$|Power {{came from}} an enlarged, 2.9L (2936 cc) [...] version of the GTO's IHI twin {{turbocharged}} V8 developing a 478bhp, according to Ferrari. <b>Most</b> <b>experts</b> today <b>agree</b> the number was well over 500 bhp. The F40 did without a catalytic converter until 1990 when US regulations made them a requirement for emissions control reasons. The flanking exhaust pipes guide exhaust gases from each bank of cylinders while the central pipe guides gases released from the wastegate of the turbochargers. Engines with catalytic converters bear F120D code.|$|R
30|$|With bipolar II patients, <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> would <b>agree</b> that mood {{stabilizers}} {{should be}} prescribed first, before antidepressant monotherapy (although this generalization may change {{as we learn}} more). But some bipolar II patients will refuse a mood stabilizer as a first treatment for depression but will agree to take an antidepressant. In this situation, antidepressant monotherapy with proper education and monitoring is appropriate. With {{the exception of a}} few studies (e.g., Amsterdam and Shults 2010; Amsterdam et al. 2015), we have little data on the risks/benefits of longer term antidepressant monotherapy in bipolar II patients.|$|R
5000|$|Steganography is a {{technique}} where information or files are hidden within another file {{in an attempt to}} hide data by leaving it in plain sight. [...] "Steganography produces dark data that is typically buried within light data (e.g., a non-perceptible digital watermark buried within a digital photograph)." [...] Some experts have argued that the use of steganography techniques are not very widespread and therefore shouldn't be given a lot of thought. <b>Most</b> <b>experts</b> will <b>agree</b> that steganography has the capability of disrupting the forensic process when used correctly.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{completely}} accurate {{explanation of}} this phenomenon, but <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> that as muscles begin to slack right after one falls asleep, the brain senses these relaxation signals and misinterpret as one is falling down.

50|$|The {{resultant}} rise of {{mass unemployment}} {{is seen as}} a result of the crash, although the crash is by no means the sole event that contributed to the depression. The Wall Street Crash is usually seen as having the greatest impact on the events that followed and therefore is widely regarded as signaling the downward economic slide that initiated the Great Depression. True or not, the consequences were dire for almost everybody. <b>Most</b> academic <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> on one aspect of the crash: It wiped out billions of dollars of wealth in one day, and this immediately depressed consumer buying.|$|R
50|$|A 2002 {{survey of}} two {{movement}} disorder experts, two neuropsychiatrists, and two rehabilitation experts {{did not seem}} to shed any light on the matter of differentiating aboulia from other DDMs. The experts used the terms apathy and aboulia interchangeably and debated whether or not aboulia was a discrete entity, or just a hazy gray area on a spectrum of more defined disorders. Four of the experts said aboulia was a sign and a symptom, and the group was split on {{whether or not it was}} a syndrome. Another survey, which consisted of true and false questions about what aboulia is distinct from, whether it is a sign, symptom, or syndrome, where lesions are present in cases of aboulia, what diseases are commonly associated with aboulia, and what current treatments are used for aboulia, was sent to 15 neurologists and 10 psychiatrists. <b>Most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agreed</b> that aboulia is clinically distinct from depression, akinetic mutism, and alexithymia. However, only 32% believed aboulia was different from apathy, while 44% said they were not different, and 24% were unsure. Yet again, there was disagreement about whether or not aboulia is a sign, symptom, or syndrome.|$|R
