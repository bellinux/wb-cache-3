It is argued that transfer fees can involve monopoly rents; the selling club extracts a share of the nonnegative differential between its reservation price and the buying club’s maximum bid-price. It is shown that a necessary condition for the presence of <b>monopoly</b> <b>rents</b> can be established by testing whether buying-club characteristics are jointly significant determinants of transfer fees after controlling for player characteristics, time effects and selling-club characteristics. Using a sample of 1, 350 English professional football transfer fees covering the period June 1990 to August 1996, it is found that <b>monopoly</b> <b>rents</b> may exist but the degree of <b>monopoly</b> <b>rents</b> may differ with the size of the transfer fee.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the potential for}} joint OECD (or non-OPEC) carbon taxes to reduce OPEC’s <b>monopoly</b> <b>rent</b> and provide benefit to non-OPEC countries provided jointly agreed trigger strategies are adhered to. In traditional economic theory, {{the primary purpose of}} a carbon tax is to internalize a global negative externality. A second benefit for individual countries is that the revenue raised by carbon tax can be used to reduce other tax rates and so lower the deadweight loss of tax system. In this paper, we discuss a third benefit of carbon taxes: transferring rents from OPEC to the oil importing countries. We develop a multi-region general equilibrium structure with endogenously determined oil supply for the purpose in which emissions are endogenously determined. We calibrate our model to 2006 data. Our analytics and numerical simulation results highlight how a uniform carbon tax used by all non-OPEC countries will increase the buyer’s price of oil but decrease the supplier’s price of oil, thus decreasing non-OPEC countries’ oil demand, and transferring OPEC <b>monopoly</b> <b>rent</b> to non-OPEC countries. Carbon taxes reduce the welfare of OPEC and increase the welfare of non-OPEC countries. Results also show how carbon taxes reduce global emissions, but the effect is small. carbon taxes, OECD, <b>monopoly</b> <b>rent...</b>|$|E
40|$|According to {{previous}} studies, a bank can set a higher interest rate for small firms {{by establishing a}} lending relationship since information asymmetry limits competition between banks. Therefore, the bank can acquire <b>monopoly</b> <b>rent</b> from small firms. However, if small firms can use trade credit which is another financial source, the bank cannot extract <b>monopoly</b> <b>rent.</b> In this article, we examine whether small firms can use trade credit if the bank sets a higher interest rate. Using panel data of small firms in Japan, our analysis shows that when the interest rate the bank sets is too severe or worsened for the borrower, the ratio of trade payables increases and the bank loses its amount of loans. This result implies that trade creditors alleviate the problems of bank information monopolies in Japan. ...|$|E

The normative justification for this conclusion derives from a theory of distributive justice called the Compensation Theory of Income Justice, which is most easily understood as a normative version of the positive economic theory of compensating differentials.

First, it highlights the theoretical importance of <b>monopoly</b> <b>rents</b> for fluctuations in average Q. A series for such rents is then computed by assuming that production is Cobb-Douglas, as fluctuations in the output share of pure profits may be inferred from variations in the labor share. Consequently, the paper focuses on the correlation between a measure of rents and observable average Q. It also reassesses the empirical disconnection between investment and a measure of marginal q purged of <b>monopoly</b> <b>rents.</b> The paper finds that the existence of pure profits as constructed from unit labor costs only accounts for about 5 % of fluctuations in observed Q, and alters only minimally the empirical relationship between q and investment.
