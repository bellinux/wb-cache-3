50|$|The onboard {{computer}} (OC) subsystem is a {{fault tolerant}} microcontroller based system. The microcontroller used is AT91SAM7x512.

Over the course of the mission, OC collects crucial data about the health of the various systems within the satellite and stores it in a non-volatile memory, only to be sent to the ground station on request. It also manages the payload of point to point communication by storing and sending messages appropriately. The major role of OC relies in handling the set of commands received from the ground stations through the communication system.

40|$|The <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> of the NASA 70 -m antennas {{include the}} antenna <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> the <b>Master</b> Equatorial <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> and their {{combinations}} (called modes). The Master Equatorial {{is a small}} telescope mounted {{on the top of}} a tower located inside the antenna structure. In the Antenna Encoder mode antenna encoders are used to close the feedback loop. In the Autocollimator mode the Master Equatorial is a master that follows a target, and the antenna is a slave that follows the Master Equatorial. In the Master Equatorial Encoder mode the “master-slave’’ relationship is reversed. In the paper the analysis begins with the description of the open loop models of the antenna and of the Master Equatorial. We obtained the models by using field test data and system identification techniques. Next, we analyzed and evaluated the performance of the three modes of the antenna <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The analysis showed that the Autocollimator and Master Equatorial Encoder tracking modes are feasible for high-rate tracking, and that the latter mode has the smallest tracking error. Finally, we analyzed the switching between antenna modes, necessary while tracking near the keyhole. We showed that switching causes jerks of magnitudes within the acceptable threshold. The 70 -meter antenna <b>control</b> <b>system</b> consists of the antenna controller itself and of the <b>Master</b> Equatorial (ME) <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The ME is a small telescope mounted {{on the top of a}} tower located inside the antenna structure, see Fig. 2. The intention was to locate the ME close to the focal point of the antenna. An optical instrument called an autocollimator creates an optional link between the antenna dish and the ME. The ME is a master: it is commanded to follow a target; and the antenna is a slave: it follows the ME using an optical coupling of the autocollimator. This configuration of the antenna and the ME <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> is called the autocollimator (AC) mode. 1...|$|R

40|$|In 1967 the {{capacitor}} bank {{was extended to}} an energy of 1, 2 MJoules and a crowbar system has been installed. A survey of the bank characteristics and of the safety principles which were followed is presented. The probability of breakdowns in a system where currents of some 10 MA are flowing was decreased by dividing the bank and the collector, which is of the multi-plate type, in elements. The danger resulting from prefiring and misfiring of start-gaps has been eliminated by charging rapidly the master-trigger generator at theend of the charging cycle and by increasing the corresponding capacity. Initially, a rather complicated electronic current monitoring system was installed. The reliable operation of the start-gaps allowed one to simplify later the set-up: the potential differences between units are followed, indicating directly {{the location of the}} eventually defective start-gap. Each crowbar-gap was provided with a fast acting current-detector. When a prefire occurs, all the remaining crowbar-gaps are triggered almost instantaneously. By keeping the transit times as short as possible, the delay has been reduced to 1 μsec. Defects in the electronic <b>master</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> could lead to a misfire of the whole crowbar system and eventually to the destruction of the discharge tube. A second slightly slower trigger path, using delay lines and spark-gaps exclusively, was built in. The charging voltages of spark-gaps and thyratrons in the crowbar trigger system are monitored: if they are missing, a blocking signal is transmitted into the <b>master</b> <b>control</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

A solar power tower uses a field of tracking mirrors (heliostats) that redirect sunlight on to a centrally located receiver mounted on top a tower, which absorbs the concentrated sunlight. Molten nitrate salt, pumped from a tank at ground level, absorbs the sunlight, heating it up to 565 C. The heated salt flows back to ground level into another tank where it is stored, then pumped through a steam generator to produce steam and make electricity.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{selected}} operation states of a traction drive with an asynchronous motor, which {{is fed from}} a voltage source converter. The following phenomena are examined: {{the response of the}} drive on step changes of required output quantities from the <b>master</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> (the required voltage magnitude and the rotor frequency), short-term blocking of all converter transistors and subsequent operation resumption while the rotor magnetic flux still exists, the short-circuit in the DC link of the converter, the interruption of energy supply into the DC link of the converter caused by crossing a long section without energy supply or by a trolley bounce. Not only does the thesis describe the problematic phenomena, but it also suggests the measures and control interventions, which help either to forestall these disturbances or soften their negative consequences, or eventually totally inhibit their appearance. The 1 st chapter is dedicated {{to the creation of a}} mathematical model of the traction drive which is controlled by a selected regulation structure of the vector control.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a telerobotic master device consisting of a 7 -axis backdrivable robotic arm, and a pressure-sensitive grip-controller integrated with a Compact Remote Console (CRC), thus creating a highly functional teleoperation station targeted to control a 6 -axis industrial robotic arm and dexterous robotic hand to be used for demolition work in a nuclear setting. We successfully completed the development of one of the world?s smallest brushless motor controllers due partially to funding through this grant. These controllers are used to drive the motors in the master robotic arm. We also completed the development of an improved model of a highly advanced 4 degree-of-freedom arm ? this same arm is the core component in the teleoperation system. The WAM arm and a 3 -axis gimbals were integrated with a commercially available CRC at our consultant?s lab at University of Tennessee. Additional support hardware and software were combined to tie the <b>master</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> to an existing industrial robot in the lab. A master controller for a dexterous hand was developed and became {{an integral part of the}} gimbals handle. Control algorithms were developed and the software was written and implemented. The entire system was then debugged and tested. Results of the prototype system are promising. The WAM Arm, gimbals, hand controller and CRC were successful integrated. Testing of the system to control the 6 -axis industrial arm and prototype dexterous hand showed great potential. Relatively simple tasks were successfully performed at slow speeds. Some of the testing was hampered by problems with the slave dexterous hand. This is a prototype hand being developed by Barrett under a different Phase II program. Potential improvements and advancements to the system include improving the control code, and integration of a 2 nd master controller arm in order to drive a 2 nd slave arm and hand. In summary, the device is a complex system with advanced features and could be used as a universal platform for efficient controlling of robotic arms performing remote tasks in unstructured and uncertain environments such as those prevalent in environmental clean up...|$|E
