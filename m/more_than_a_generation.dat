25|$|Blacks cleared land, selling {{timber and}} {{developing}} bottomland to achieve ownership. In 1900, two-thirds of farm owners in Mississippi were blacks, a major achievement {{for them and}} their families. Due to the poor economy, low cotton prices and difficulty of getting credit, many of these farmers could not make it through the extended financial difficulties. Two decades later, the majority of African Americans were sharecroppers. The low prices of cotton into the 1890s meant that <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> of African Americans lost the result of their labor when they had to sell their farms to pay off accumulated debts.|$|E

The new Norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old French aristocracy, most of whom traced their lineage to Franks of the Carolingian dynasty.

This victory, celebrated by the triumphal monument at Pergamon (famous for its Dying Gaul) and the liberation from the Gallic [...] "terror" [...] which it represented, earned for Attalus the name of [...] "Soter", and the title of [...] "king". A courageous and capable general and loyal ally of Rome, he {{played a significant role}} in the first and second Macedonian Wars, waged against Philip V of Macedon. He conducted numerous naval operations, harassing Macedonian interests throughout the Aegean, winning honors, collecting spoils, and gaining for Pergamon possession of the Greek islands of Aegina during the first war, and Andros during the second, twice narrowly escaping capture at the hands of Philip.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the strike}} was lost, the Amalgamated charged Gompers with [...] "lukewarmness" [...] and Mitchell of the U.M.W. with failure {{to keep a}} promise to support steelworkers. Although Gompers and Mitchell were exonerated by a {{committee}} of the federation, the indictment made an impression. It served to focus attention upon Gompers' and Mitchell's association with industrialists in the National Civic Federation. The more aggressive labor leaders began to reveal a suspicion of the alliance; socialists became convinced that Gompers had sold out; even some middle-class reformers [...] sympathetic to labor began to doubt. Such attitudes {{became the basis for}} Mitchell's removal as U.M.W. head in 1908 and for attacks upon Gompers by radical labor elements until his death in the mid-twenties.

50|$|Spaniards in Equatorial Guinea did not {{generally}} immigrate {{with the intent}} of permanently establishing themselves, but rather of working for a given time period, and nearly always returned to Spain. The result was a reduced sense of permanency, and a greater bilateral contact between Spain and expatriate Spaniards in Guinea. Even though a number of Spaniards were born in Guinea, few considered themselves as anything other than Spaniards, similar to their countrymen in the Canary Islands or Ifni, and there were few families that had lived continuously in Spanish Guinea for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> single <b>generation.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Philip Sheldon Foner (December 14, 1910 [...] December 13, 1994) was an American labor {{historian}} and teacher. Foner was a prolific author {{and editor of}} more than 100 books.

A Marxist thinker, he influenced <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> of scholars, inspiring some of the work published by younger academics from the 1970s on. In 1941, Foner became a public figure as one among 26 persons fired from teaching and staff positions at City College of New York for political views, following an investigation of communist influence in education by a state legislative committee, known as the Rapp-Coudert Committee.|$|E

It was used with a pestle to purÃ©e or pulverise ingredients in order to prepare elaborate and carefully seasoned Roman dishes; the Roman culinary tradition made extensive use of herbs and spices. The mortarium was the Roman equivalent of the food-processor, and is a real indicator of 'romanisation'; In Britain, the first mortaria were being imported from Gaulish sources <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> before Britain became a Roman province in AD 43, indicating the growing influence of Roman culture in late Iron Age southern Britain, and perhaps the actual presence of immigrants from Gaul. Later, locally-made mortaria produced at specialised potteries in different areas of the province were available throughout Britain, in addition to imported products: Paul Tyers discusses mortaria from no fewer than 16 different manufacturing sources, Romano-British and Continental, that have been found in Britain. Like so many other specialised Roman ceramic products, many mortaria also bore workshop or makers' stamps on their rims, and noting their chronology and distribution can help archaeologists understand trading patterns and the Roman economy.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} about his early life, but he was {{probably}} born west of Chartres, perhaps {{in the town of}} Brunelles, near to Nogent-le-Rotrou, making him one of the first of the Netherlandish composers who was actually French. [...] He sang at Notre-Dame de Chartres from 9 August 1483 until 1486, and subsequently held posts at St Peter's in Geneva (until 1492) and Laon (around 1497) before becoming choirmaster to the boys at Notre-Dame de Paris from 1498 to 1500, and choirmaster to Alfonso I d'Este at Ferrara from 1506, replacing the famous composer Jacob Obrecht who had died of the plague there the previous year. [...] The chapel there was disbanded in 1510, after which he evidently stayed in Italy; several documents connect him with churches in Faenza and Mantua, where he probably died in 1512 or shortly after. [...] He is known to have written at least one work after his dismissal from Ferrara (the Missa de beata virgine), and he may still have been alive in 1513 since there is a mention in a treatise of Vincenzo Galilei that Brumel was {{one of a group of}} composers who met with Pope Leo X in that year; however since Vincenzo was writing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> later and reporting second-hand, and no other corroborating evidence has been found, this account is not considered to be certain.
