The paper addresses the problems of the semantic level of a work depending on the tokens that he uses in the paper, tokens that are extracted in a preprocessing step of analysis. The tokens are defined using a lexical ontology, for the English words referring to WordNet, and the automatic extracting of those tokens from the words found in the particular processed papers. The <b>main</b> <b>vocabulary</b> richness evaluation metrics are presented taking into account the major literature review and extracting the main steps into a new proposed metric that is combining the vocabulary richness with the semantic layer of a paper. The concept of author mark is described. The objective of this research paper is highlighted into the new proposed metric that is non-dependent on the main subject discussed in the analyzed paper. This objective leads to a general metric that combines documents from different subjects into a metric that can describe the vocabulary richness of a specific author depending on the works that he had written. Furthermore, the analysis is conducting into a time evolution of this metric, using the extraction of the trend of the author’s vocabulary richness indicator.

40|$|Abstract Background Olea europaea L. is a {{traditional}} tree crop of the Mediterranean basin with a worldwide economical high impact. Differently from other fruit tree species, {{little is known about}} the physiological and molecular basis of the olive fruit development and a few sequences of genes and gene products are available for olive in public databases. This study deals with the identification of large sets of differentially expressed genes in developing olive fruits and the subsequent computational annotation by means of different software. Results mRNA from fruits of the cv. Leccino sampled at three different stages [i. e., initial fruit set (stage 1), completed pit hardening (stage 2) and veraison (stage 3) ] was used for the identification of differentially expressed genes putatively involved in main processes along fruit development. Four subtractive hybridization libraries were constructed: forward and reverse between stage 1 and 2 (libraries A and B), and 2 and 3 (libraries C and D). All sequenced clones (1, 132 in total) were analyzed through BlastX against non-redundant NCBI databases and about 60 % of them showed similarity to known proteins. A total of 89 out of 642 differentially expressed unique sequences was further investigated by Real-Time PCR, showing a validation of the SSH results as high as 69 %. Library-specific cDNA repertories were annotated according to the three <b>main</b> <b>vocabularies</b> of the gene ontology (GO) : cellular component, biological process and molecular function. BlastX analysis, GO terms mapping and annotation analysis were performed using the Blast 2 GO software, a research tool designed with the main purpose of enabling GO based data mining on sequence sets for which no GO annotation is yet available. Bioinformatic analysis pointed out a significantly different distribution of the annotated sequences for each GO category, when comparing the three fruit developmental stages. The olive fruit-specific transcriptome dataset was used to query all known KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes) metabolic pathways for characterizing and positioning retrieved EST records. The integration of the olive sequence datasets within the MapMan platform for microarray analysis allowed the identification of specific biosynthetic pathways useful for the definition of key functional categories in time course analyses for gene groups. Conclusion The bioinformatic annotation of all gene sequences was useful to shed light on metabolic pathways and transcriptional aspects related to carbohydrates, fatty acids, secondary metabolites, transcription factors and hormones as well as response to biotic and abiotic stresses throughout olive drupe development. These results represent a first step toward both functional genomics and systems biology research for understanding the gene functions and regulatory networks in olive fruit growth and ripening. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a very {{exploratory}} piece about the mathematics of vocabularies, intended to provoke discussion rather than to provide answers. Like many British linguists, my own mathematical education is fairly rudimentary, and over the many years that I {{have been working on}} vocabulary acquisition, I have increasingly found this to be a problem. In other areas of applied linguistics, it is still possible to work with informal models- indeed, a great deal of British Applied linguistics is work of this sort. However, when it comes to working on vocabularies the limitations of informal models make themselves apparent very quickly. The <b>main</b> problem with <b>vocabularies</b> is that they are big: even on the most conservative estimates of vocabulary size in monolinguals, we must be dealing with 15, 000 or more items in the average person's lexicon, and it is, frankly, difficult to see how we can talk sensibly about something as large as this without using some sort of mathematical simplification.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityCommunication proficiency is vital to academic achievement. However, many students with communication deficits face challenges in today's classrooms. Current measures often fail to assess classroom behaviors crucial to academic success. An effective assessment tool is needed to provide appropriate identification and instruction for students with communication deficits. Purposes of this study were: 1. To determine perceptions of classroom teachers concerning the importance of behaviors that predict communication problems in children, and 2. To determine whether differences in perceptions of teachers are related to independent variables of grade taught, teaching experience, educational attainment and professional development. The study analyzed archival data from K- 6 elementary teachers. Responses were examined from a ninety-four item checklist of communication behavior indicators. Teachers ranked indicators based on their perception of importance for predicting classroom performance. Respondents also identified independent variables for grade level(s) taught, years of teaching experience, and level of educational attainment. A smaller sample of teachers was used to analyze level of agreement with eight professional development statements regarding collaboration, training, and experience in teaching students with communication deficits. Frequency, percentage, response means, and statistical significance tests were used. Range testing confirmed distinct groupings of behavioral variables. Data were further broken into groupings based on independent variables. This study found that teachers generally valued: * Understanding and responding to spoken information, * Expressing thoughts with simple sentences, clear articulation, and basic vocabulary, * Appropriate conversational skills, * Name spelling and writing, constructing simple sentences, printing letters, and interpreting writing. * Following instructions and task completion, * Letter/word recognition, syllabication, and retelling, and * Professional collaboration. Minimal differences across independent variables included behaviors such as requesting clarification, understanding <b>main</b> ideas, <b>vocabulary,</b> and interpretation of writing. Grade level taught and experience accounted for most differences. Findings {{of this study indicate}} a need for educators to consider teacher perceptions and classroom performance behaviors in planning assessment, instruction, and professional development to support academic achievement for students with communication deficits. Further study is needed to explore variance in perceptions among groups. Additional research might compare perceptions of speech-language professionals and classroom teachers...|$|R

It sought to explore the strategies used by four English teachers in teaching EFL vocabulary in accommodating the learners’ learning strategies, some problems faced by the teachers, and the ways of solving such problems. This research employed a qualitative case study research design. The data were obtained from various sources, including questionnaires, classroom observation, and an interview conducted to all teachers soon after the program. All these instruments were use to triangulate the results of analysis done afterwards. The results showed that the teachers to some extent have been able to demonstrate appropriate vocabulary teaching strategies to accommodate the learners’ vocabulary learning strategies as outlined in learners’ taxonomy of vocabulary learning strategies.

The findings showed that the students need Indonesian culture based material English classroom. They preferred to have conversation class about the related topic in order to promote the culture in the tourism industry. The finding also showed that the teacher should provide specific speaking material about Indonesian culture with appropriate techniques in running and organizing the class. Since vocabularies were becoming the <b>main</b> problem, therefore <b>vocabularies</b> engagement should be involved in the material. Further suggestions for ESP educators were elaborated in this study.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} is a 'critical edition' of {{a system}} of actor training based on three <b>main</b> sources: a <b>vocabulary</b> of movement analysis developed by Rudolf Laban {{in the last years of}} his life; C. G. Jung's theory of psychological functions and types; and the acting system of C. Stanislavski and his main followers. The three strands were brought together by the dancer and acting teacher Yat Malmgren (1916 - 2002), who taught his system for over forty years to some of the major figures of world theatre and film: Peter Brook, Pierce Brosnan, Simon Callow, Sean Connery, Anthony Hopkins, Adrian Noble among others. The dissertation is presented in two volumes: - Volume I sets the system in context, historically as well as in terms of current discourses about the nature of acting. It includes a survey of its origins, followed by an in-depth examination of its three main sources, focusing on the central concept of energy in acting. Further chapters describe: a. a systematic, step-by-step psychophysical approach to analysing character, the actor's own self and to ways of bridging the two in the process of transformation. The author captures the salient features of a method of work which informs aspects of Western acting practice. b. the light thrown by the system on the idea of theatre character. The author puts forward the idea of a character 'independent' of both actor and text. c. the applications of the system in training and professional practice, based on interviews with a number of prominent British actors and directors. - Volume II consists of a detailed, annotated description of the system. It is based on a free transcript of recordings of Yat Malmgren's teaching and amounts to a 'manual' for those interested in studying and/or teaching the system. The volume is illustrated throughout. Appendices include original materials derived from Laban's last years of work, published here for the first time...|$|R
40|$|After 10 -year-use of AFLP {{technology}} for DNA fingerprinting and mRNA profiling, large repertories of genome- and transcriptome-derived sequences {{are available in}} public databases for model, crop and tree species. AFLP marker systems have been and are being extensively exploited for genome scanning and gene mapping, as well as cDNA-AFLP for transcriptome profiling and differentially expressed gene cloning. The evaluation, annotation and classification of genomic markers and expressed transcripts would be of great utility for both functional genomics and systems biology research in plants. We retrieved from both NCBI databases and private repertories a total of 7, 806 cDNA-AFLP sequences related to roots, leaves, stems, flowers, fruits and seeds, along with the 285 publicly available genomic AFLP sequences. All these entries belong to 22 different species distributed among seven botanic families: Solanaceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae, Salicaceae, Rosaceae, Brassicaceae and Vitaceae. Redundant sequences were preliminarily clustered to select singlets and assemble contigs. BlastX analysis against non-redundant protein databases, GO terms mapping and annotation analysis were then performed using Blast 2 GO, a research tool designed with {{the main purpose of}} enabling GO based data mining on sequence sets for which no GO annotation is yet available. Descriptive statistics on the type, size and nature of chromosome regions and gene sequences mainly investigated using the AFLP technology were calculated. The gene sequences associated to mRNA transcripts and proteins were classified according to the GO vocabularies. In addition to cellular component, biological process and molecular function, other hierarchically structured GO terms were adopted to query sequences and to assign genes and gene products at different levels, depending on the depth of knowledge. A classification of all cDNA-AFLP records for the <b>main</b> GO <b>vocabularies</b> was also performed by splitting the sequence dataset in monocots and dicots and by comparing the two subgroups with all annotated ESTs of Arabidopsis and rice. The examination and annotation of EST clones enabled basic inferences to be made on the potentials and drawbacks of AFLP {{technology for}} mRNA profiling and differential display gene cloning. Although the different number of sequences retrieved in gene banks for plant organisms and organs might have biased some of the descriptive statistics, the whole set of data emerged from gene ontologies is consistent with the existence of AFLP features exploitable across plant transcriptomes (e. g., ESTs associated to kinase activity can be assayed with very similar rates (11 %) in each of the families analyzed in this study) and supports the reliability of expression patterns detection using very small amounts of messengers (i. e., DD-cDNA-AFLP applied to tissues where it is hard to isolate stage-specific mRNAs, such as flowers, fruits and seeds). On the whole, experimental steps and statistical parameters adopted for the in silico AFLP technology-derived sequence analysis proved to be critical for obtaining robust ontology data. Annotation results for the whole sequence dataset and also for botanic families, single species and plant organs are presented and the main features of genes and gene products detectable in plants by genomic AFLP fingerprinting and cDNA-AFLP profiling discussed. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first large-scale survey of amplified fragment length polymorphism-derived sequences belonging to plant angiosperms...|$|R
40|$|The chapter {{describes}} the various information technologies {{that can be}} used for managing enterprise knowledge. It first introduces knowledge management from a historical point of view and gives some definitions of the <b>main</b> concepts and <b>vocabulary.</b> Then it proposes a grid for a classification of the different useful information technologies. Then, it {{describes the}} said technologies. The chapter is a summary of a tutorial that was given at ISSADS 2003 and ISSADS 2004 at Guadelajara (Jalisco, Mexico). 1. Knowledge Management First, let us introduce briefly knowledge management, as well as some basic concepts that I will use later in the text. 1. 1. Where does KM come from? Figure 1 - Fortune, June 1991 Knowledge Management became a key issue in the 90 s after an article was published by Stewart in Fortune magazine (Fig 1). In the article several successful CEOs were interviewed and were asked why their company was more successful than the competition. The answer was unanimous and mentioned a better management of “intellectual assets, ” i. e. of the company knowledge. Following this paper, most enterprises wanted to do something and developed some approach intended to better manage their knowledge. The term knowledge management however, had been introduced several years before by Wiig (), as a description of his consultancy job. In the 90 s tremendous predictions were made about the potential market of KM. For example the Gartner Group quoted in IW in October 1997 stated that there would be $ 1. 5 billion of consultancy fees in 1996 and $ 5 billions per year expected by 2001. Ernst & Young in the same issue reported a survey done in US enterprises showing that 40 % US firms were already involved, 25 % planned to start KM projects in 1998, 94 % thought it would be useful. The market did not materialized as expected and KM today in general mainly reduces to a combination of groupware and document management. In the mean time however, a number of technologies were tried and could be used to take into account some of the aspects of KM, which is the subject of this chapter...|$|R

Surakarta. English Education, Graduate School, Sebelas Maret University, 2008. This {{thesis is}} aimed {{to know whether}} {{reciprocal}} questioning technique can improve students’ reading comprehension or not, what happens if reciprocal questioning technique is used in teaching reading practices, and {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of reciprocal questioning technique when it is used to teach reading. The research was done in SMK Diponegoro Salatiga from November 2007 to August 2008. The subject of the study was the first year students of Accounting Program consisting of 44 students. It was a classroom action research. The researcher did some steps for each cycle. They were planning, action, observation, and reflection. In collecting the data, the researcher applied several techniques including observation, field notes, interview, questionnaire, and test. To analyze the test, the researcher used descriptive statistics including the average scores and students’ score categories. Besides that, the researcher used t-test for non independent to compare the scores before and after treatments. To analyze the qualitative data, the researcher used flow model analysis that draws the conclusions from available data. She observed the students’ response in teaching learning process supported by field notes, interview, and questionnaire and finally, she drew the conclusion. The research findings showed that the students had problems related to their inability to differentiate between WH and yes/no questions. The other problems were related to the components of reading comprehension, they were the problems in identifying <b>main</b> idea, detail, <b>vocabulary,</b> and making inference. In the beginning, the students were not aware to make certain types of questions during reciprocal questioning process. Therefore, the researcher focused on maximizing the students’ awareness to make the types of questions that they usually omitted by using herringbone scheme. In result, the students were more highly interested and interactive in making reciprocal questions in all types of questions. For that reason, herringbone technique was able to stimulate students to do reciprocal questioning better. Based on t-test, it could be concluded that there was significant improvement between pretest and posttest. In conclusion, reciprocal questioning technique is empirically able to improve students’ reading comprehension. However, reciprocal questioning technique has its own strength and weakness. Reciprocal questioning technique stimulated students to be autonomous and active readers. Moreover, the students could predict what questions that probably occurred in the task after reading. On the other hand, reciprocal questioning is less effective for the passive learners who prefer reading by themselves without trying to make questions while reading the texts. In short, it is recommended to the teachers to use reciprocal questioning technique in teaching reading comprehension, so that it can be students’ own reading strategies in order to catch their own reading comprehension...|$|R
40|$|Former Director of Studies: Professor Antonio CaroniaTine Melzer: Ludwig Wittgenstein & Gertrude Stein – Meeting in Language The {{purpose of}} this study is to show {{transitions}} between verbal and visual meaning in ordinary language, based on philosophical concepts and conceptual artworks. It offers models for artistic research and collaboration in arts and science. Shared experiences in ordinary language are fundamental to this thesis and make it an accessible and trans-disciplinary study. Language as such, is approached from different practices and disciplines and becomes the central object of investigation. The research introduces a general set of mechanisms in language, stemming from the Wittgensteinian notion of the language-game. The study examines the possibility of a meeting between the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and the writer Gertrude Stein in a linguistic, biographical and poetic sense. The main claim is that Wittgenstein and Stein share the understanding of language as a game, which is a fruitful principle for artistic and poetic production. Gertrude Stein developed a dimension in her writing which partly succeeds in showing this notion of creating meaning-as-practice and making sense on the ‘edge’ of conventional meaning. In this way she augments Wittgenstein’s idea of the language-game and puts it into practice, tests its limits on her own language and on the reader’s habits. The artistic works represented in this thesis are equally experimental tests of Wittgenstein’s meaning-as-use hypothesis. They put his ideas into practice. They extend the research with strategies from the arts, poetry and fiction. The methodology of the research is based on Wittgenstein’s notion of meaning as context-dependent use. This concept defines the meaning of a word by the way it is used in a specific context. This perspective is then challenged with visual artistic work. This hypothesis is tested throughout the research by applying tools and concepts from several practices, like computer linguistic tools, collaboration with writers and artists from other fields and autonomous visual and poetic work to augment the study of facts. Conceptual artworks, often produced in collaboration, function as language experiments, or language-games. The Wittgensteinian differentiation between what can be shown and what can be said is examined. The context of the research lies in the practices developed as a conceptual artist in which theoretical research informs artistic practice. This thesis, on the border between verbal and visual language, is founded upon antecedent studies in philosophy of language and the practice of Fine Arts. Against this background the research focuses on the relationship between word, context and meaning: issues of communication, ordinary language, words and their composition, context-based meaning, naming visual phenomena, examination of word-and-world-relationships and <b>vocabularies.</b> <b>Main</b> sources are the major works and biographies of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Gertrude Stein, the critical work of Marjorie Perloff, language philosophers concerned with ordinary language and the contrastive corpus linguistic approach. The results of this research are generated by several interdisciplinary productive methods. Artworks, poetic and scientific work, all of which employ modes of language, and whose their domains overlap. Additionally, the notion of meeting acts as model metaphor for the development of a solid trans-disciplinary methodology for research between science and the arts. One major result of comparing their ideas on language is reflected in the meeting of the language used by Wittgenstein and Stein. Their meeting is materialized in the computer generated Shared Vocabulary, which is a list of words which both Wittgenstein and Stein used in their writing. It applies linguistic tools from contrastive corpus linguistics to compare their vocabularies (corpora), which offers new methods for investigating the works of the philosopher Wittgenstein and writer Stein. Generally, this thesis may act as an introduction to language as ideal fundament for interdisciplinary study. The application of the principle of the language-game (Wittgenstein) is a significant of displaying possible strategies for artists and researchers who work transdisciplinarily. The research results directly inform practice and practitioners from other fields, which means that collaboration is central to the research. It implies that language permeates every sort of research, art and its discourse. It also suggests that the meaning of words and images depend on their use, which extends the Wittgensteinian meaning-as-use hypothesis to visual language. The findings of the research on vocabularies are quite specific, but they overlap with offering simple general mechanisms of the language-game. The consequent alliance of the discussion with the language of the everyday makes the research a general contribution to everyone who is genuinely interested in language and the arts. Parts of this research were supported by The Netherlands Foundation for Visual Arts, Design and Architecture (Fonds BKVB, Studiebeurs) and Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds Amsterdam (Cultuurfondsbeurs...|$|R
