This study seeks to identify the {{factors that contribute to}} work satisfaction or dissatisfaction of doctors in the South African public health sector as well as bringing forth strategies that are important in retaining <b>medical</b> <b>doctors</b> in the sector. A cross-sectional survey using self-administered pre-tested questionnaires was mailed to 1000 randomly selected <b>medical</b> <b>doctors</b> in the public health sector of South Africa to get their opinions.

The <b>medical</b> <b>doctors</b> identified lack of participation in management as the major factor hampering work satisfaction in the public sector.
