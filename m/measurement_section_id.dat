40|$|A {{too small}} optical {{accessible}} {{area of the}} old <b>Measurement</b> <b>Section</b> of the Cavitation tunnel made monitoring the upcoming experiments, with for instance high speed cameras, impossible. This was its main imperfection. A proper amount of optical accessible area needed lead too this conversion. The new <b>Measurement</b> <b>Section</b> designed has an optical accessible area which is sufficient for the experiments. It was needed to have a zero velocity-, and pressure gradient over the new <b>Measurement</b> <b>Section.</b> The displacement thickness of the boundary layer which narrows effectively the inner of the <b>Measurement</b> <b>Section</b> would lead to acceleration of the flow and therefore needed to be compensated. This was done by gradually descending the bottom plate of the new <b>Measurement</b> <b>Section</b> over its length, since the side walls of the new <b>Measurement</b> <b>Section</b> had to be parallel for a constant distance of the camera to the side walls over its total length.

30|$|Assign {{and process}} {{sections}} The first pass labels network and elevation data with the section they belong to. The details {{are described in}} Algorithm 2. The data is processed by two mappers. The first mapper reads network lines data network_i as text and calculates the <b>section</b> <b>id</b> based on the coordinates of the network lines. The key value pairs emitted from the mapper are <sectionID_j,networkline_l >. The second mapper similarly reads elevation data elevation_j and calculates the <b>section</b> <b>id</b> and emits key-value pairs <sectionID_j,elevation_i >. The reducer reads the data and aggregates all elevation and network line observations for the <b>section</b> <b>id</b> and applies the flight plans builder algorithm for the section. It first builds a spatial index for all the elevation points for the subregion based on the network and elevation data in memory. It then identifies subregions as quadcopter and conventional subregions based on the elevation and autonomy constraints, shrinking, expanding and merging subregions as needed. The final key-value pairs emitted in the reducer consist {{of the details of}} each subregion within a section, namely the subregion id subregion_j, the subregion extent xsr_j,ysr_j,xer_j,yer_j which represents the diagonal coordinates of the subregion starting from bottom left edge xsr_j,ysr_j to top right edge xer_j,yer_j. It also includes a flag indicating if it is a quadcopter or conventional drone subregion, the network lines and elevation points and waypoints waypoint_k,...,waypoint_l for a quadcopter or conventional drone to follow along the network lines in the subregion. If there are no network lines in the subsection emitted by mapper the reducer simply exits.|$|R

The developed system consists of a lighting system, a <b>measurement</b> <b>section</b> and a data acquisition system.

The four CCD linear image sensors consisting of 2048 pixels with a pixel size of 14 micron by 14 micron are used to produce a high-resolution system. A simple optical model is mapped into the system’s sensitivity matrix to relate the optical attenuation due to variations of optical density within the <b>measurement</b> <b>section.</b> A reconstructed tomographic image is produced based on the model using MATLAB software.

The input to the mapper consists of the subregions subregion_j with their extent, the drone type needed, network lines and elevation points in the subregion and the waypoints. For the subregions located along the vertical edge of the sections associated with their <b>section</b> <b>id,</b> reducer pairs the corresponding left and right subregions. The subregions can thus be merged if they are covered by the same drone type. The output from the reducer consists of the entire set of subregions, including the merged subregions.

40|$|To {{measure a}} flow {{in a closed}} duct, one of the {{available}} methods is to explore the velocity field. With this method, {{the quality of the}} flow measurement is very dependent on the location of the velocity measurement points in the duct section. Recommendations about velocity schemes are proposed in international standards (ISO 3966, ISO 7145, EN 12599 …) for circular and rectangular ducts. These recommendations assume that a turbulent flow profile is established. This requires flow profiler and/or long straight lengths upstream and downstream the <b>measurement</b> <b>section.</b> On site, these recommendations are difficult to apply strictly because conditions of straight lengths are often not available. Secondly, the velocity measurement schemes proposed in standards are often time consuming and users prefer sometimes to simplify them. In this case, the estimation of the measurement error is not known. A numerical study has been carried out to investigate the influence of the velocity measurement scheme on the flow measurement when the distance between disturbances and the <b>measurement</b> <b>section</b> is small in the case of circular and rectangular ducts. The results are presented in term of measurement error according to the shape of the duct, velocity scheme, number of velocity measurements, distance between disturbances and <b>measurement</b> <b>section...</b>|$|R

30|$|Algorithm 6 {{provides}} the in-memory section by section flight path implementation in Spark using RDDs. Since all operations are performed in-memory, the algorithm simply transforms the input data into RDD elements that represent all elevation data in step 1 {{and the network}} line data in step 2 within each section. The flatMapToPair function flattens the data elements for a key into a single value in the transformed RDD. Step 3 joins the two RDDs with their <b>section</b> <b>id</b> and then applies the flight plans builder to the data points in each section.

This set-up enables the decomposition of the sound field into azimuthal and radial duct modes up to a frequency of 17 kHz. Thus the dominant sound generation mechanisms, caused by the aerodynamic interaction of rotor blades with the fixed blade rows, could be identified and the amount of sound power transported in and against the flow direction evaluated...|$|R
