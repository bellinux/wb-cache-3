Since short <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> have strong nonlinear relation with decision variables of candidate transmission lines, current power grid planning models have defects of heavy computational burden and low solution accuracy. In an actual power grid planning project, instead of embedding constraints in the grid planning model, short <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> are calculated after determining {{the power grid}} planning result.
