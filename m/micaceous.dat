This style of ceramics {{has been associated with}} the highland K'iche' Maya. These new ceramics did not replace the pre-existing Ocosito complex but rather became mingled with them.|$|E
5|$|The {{city core}} is {{situated}} in a region dominated by old Hercynian granites, including Póvoa de Varzim Granite and Santo André Granite. A continuous area dominated by schist exists to the Northeast and vernacular architecture of the rural areas highlight the local geological diversity. Oldest rocks, from the Pre-Ordovician epoch, {{are found in the}} Schist-greywacke Complex between Rates, Laundos, and Estela. Wandering even further Northeast, there is shale of <b>micaceous</b> clay nature, occasionally quartzite, dating to the Devonian period, that may contain fossils.|$|E
5|$|Ceramic finds at {{the site}} include {{frequent}} finds of incense-burners with handles and molded decoration. The most common domestic ceramics are of a <b>micaceous</b> ware and include ceramic comals (a type of griddle). Imported ceramics include Chinautla Polychrome and White-on-red, they are reasonably common {{at the site}}. Brown bowls are of a type also found in Zaculeu and Mixco Viejo, both of which also had a Late Postclassic occupation. Three-legged metates (a kind of mortar) were frequently recovered from the excavations and black obsidian blades were found in great quantities. Simple jade jewellery was also found.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper parts}} of the {{district}} is characterised by massive posts of medium to fine sandstone up to 6m thick separated by chocolate coloured shales which are <b>micaceous.</b> The pots are well bedded and often quarried for building only occasionally are they false bedded.|$|E
25|$|The Ordovician turbidites, {{consisting}} of greywacke, feldspathic sandstone, <b>micaceous</b> siltstone, <b>micaceous</b> shale, chert, and phyllite, {{are very similar}} {{in all parts of}} the Tasman Orogen, including New Zealand and the Transantarctic Mountains. Detrital zircons from the turbidites have been isotopically dated with age ranges of 0.46 and 0.60 Gya, 1.0 and 1.2 Gya, and at ~1.8 Gya, ~2.2 Gya and ~2.7 Gya. These do not match the age of zircons from the interior of the Australian Shield, so the source of the sediments is from another continent. The other evidence from the Ordovician sediments are chemical composition indicates granitic source, with the absence of feldspar. Secondly the fine grained nature shows the sediments have been transported a long way from their ultimate, source, and could have been second cycle, derived from sedimentary rocks.|$|E
25|$|On {{the western}} edge of the Yilgarn Craton, {{partially}} covered by Phanerozoic sedimentary basins and in faulted contact with the 2.7 Ga to 2.55 Ga Yilgarn tectonic domains, lies the Jumperding Gneiss Complex of 2.75 to 2.65 Ga age, composed primarily of <b>micaceous</b> quartzite, quartz-feldspar-biotite-garnet gneiss, andalusite and sillimanite schists, banded iron formation and other exotics, intruded by minor masses of porphyritic granite.|$|E
25|$|Anhydrous chromium(III) {{chloride}} adopts the YCl3 structure, with Cr3+ occupying {{two thirds}} of the octahedral interstices in alternating layers of a pseudo-cubic close packed lattice of Cl− ions. The absence of cations in alternate layers leads to weak bonding between adjacent layers. For this reason, crystals of CrCl3 cleave easily along the planes between layers, which results in the flaky (<b>micaceous)</b> appearance of samples of chromium(III) chloride.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} artefacts {{recovered from the}} Monument are the eight Zimbabwe Birds. These were carved from a <b>micaceous</b> schist (soapstone) {{on the tops of}} monoliths the height of a person. Slots in a platform in the Eastern Enclosure of the Hill Complex appear designed to hold the monoliths with the Zimbabwe birds, but as they were not found in situ it cannot be determined which monolith and bird were where. Other artefacts include soapstone figurines (one of which is in the British Museum), pottery, iron gongs, elaborately worked ivory, iron and copper wire, iron hoes, bronze spearheads, copper ingots and crucibles, and gold beads, bracelets, pendants and sheaths.|$|E
25|$|The {{conglomerate}} {{is typically}} a medium to fine grained brown to buff sandstone consisting of angular to sub angular grains with scattered flakes of mica; {{it makes a}} good building stone. Conglomerates occur in the basal part of the sequence and shale bands that are <b>micaceous</b> occur in the highest beds. Viewed regionally, the conglomerates appear to be impersistent. Near {{the southern end of}} the district where the ground is not covered by drift three conglomerates can be mapped. The bottom and most important is mostly pebbles - quartz and quartzites with occasional grits and rarely some igneous. These are set in a medium to coarse grained sand matrix. the pebbles can be up to 100mm long.|$|E
25|$|The Dox Formation {{consists}} of a heterogeneous mixture of light-tan to greenish brown, siliceous quartz sandstone; calcareous lithic and arkosic sandstone; dark-brown-to-green shale and mudstone; red mudstone, siltstone, and quartz sandstone; sandy argillite; <b>micaceous</b> mudstone; and red quartzose, silty sandstone. In ascending order, these sediments have been subdivided into the Escalante Creek, Solomon Temple, Comanche Point, and Ochoa Point Members. Stromatolites have been reported from the Comanche Point Member. The Dox Formation locally interfingers with, and is baked by, basalt lava flows of the overlying Cardenas Basalt. Within the central Grand Canyon, pre-Tapeats Sandstone erosion has removed parts of the Unkar Group above {{the level of the}} middle part of the Dox Formation. The missing part of the Dox Formation and overlying Cardenas Basalt and Chuar Group {{can be found in a}} prominent syncline and fault block in the eastern Grand Canyon. The Dox Formation accumulated in a variety of marine, coastal, estuarine, and fluvial environments.|$|E
25|$|The Pittman Formation was {{described}} originally by Öpik in 1958 who named {{it after the}} Pittman Valley, southeast of Aranda, Australian Capital Territory. It is entirely of Ordovician age and about 800 metres thick near Canberra, but at Captains Flat it is over 1,200 metres thick. The lower levels are greywacke, exposed east of Queanbeyan and north are very thick and heavily overturned and thrusted. At Etheridge Creek, the type locality is a repeating pattern of sandstone, <b>micaceous</b> sandy shale, mudstone, black argillaceous and radiolarian chert. In the sandstone beds there are occurrences of graded bedding, clay pellets, and current bedding. Fossils of graptolites, radiolarians, conodonts, and occasionally brachiopods and sponges are found. The geological formation east of Queanbeyan {{used to be known}} as the Muriarra Formation. This alternates between sandstone with a high quartz content and mica, and phyllite. Radiolarian chert is found in the central section. The railway forms the border between Queanbeyan in NSW and Oaks Estate in the ACT. West of the Queanbeyan railway station is a cutting where folding has overturned the beds, with axes dipping to the east at 50 degrees. 300 metres of thickness is exposed in this cutting. Llanvirnian age (Pygodus serrus conodont zone). Fossils found include Phyllograptus anna, Trigonograptus ensiformus, Pterograptus, Didymograptus, Isograptus, Hallograptus from the Darriwillian age. Near the top of the formation are fossils Dicellograptus sextans, D divaricatus, D salopiensis, which are Gisbornian.|$|E

The lower sequence contains runzelmark syn-sedimentary structures.|$|E
2500|$|The Florianópolis Formation is [...] {{thick in}} the type oil well, and {{consists}} of reddish, fine to coarse-grained sandstones with a clay matrix, reddish <b>micaceous</b> shales and siltstones. These clastic units are thought to represent alluvial environments distributed along the western Brazilian basin margin, along the Santos Hinge Line. These alluvial environments were gradational towards the east, with the shallow marine carbonates of the Guarujá Formation, and further to the open basin with the siltstones of the Itanhaém Formation. Biostratigraphical data and {{its relations with the}} Guarujá Formation point towards an Albian age.|$|E
2500|$|The upper {{member of}} the Dox Formation is the Ochoa Point Member. Within the central Grand Canyon, it also has been removed by pre-Tapeats Sandstone erosion. It {{consists}} of <b>micaceous</b> mudstone that grades upward into a predominantly red quartzose, silty sandstone. Sedimentary structures found in this member include, salt crystal casts in the mudstone, and asymmetrical ripple marks and small-scale cross beds, in the sandstones. The Ochoa Point Member is [...] thick and forms steep slopes and cliffs below the Cardenas Basalt. The Dox Formation that directly underlies the Cardenas Basalt consists of brick-red to vermilion well-bedded sandstone, with parallel bedding and shaly partings, forming smooth slopes. It also contains a thin, discontinuous basaltic lava flow.|$|E
2500|$|The Bogotá Formation, {{named after}} the capital, is a Paleocene to Lower Eocene {{argillaceous}} unit, concordantly overlying the lower Paleogene sequence. The formation is composed of grey, purple and red shales with <b>micaceous</b> sandstone beds towards {{the top of the}} stratigraphical unit. The thickness in the subsurface of the Bogotá savanna ranges from [...] and outcrops {{at the edges of the}} flatlands. In this formation fossils of the ungulate Etayoa bacatensis, {{named after the}} name for the savanna and its main settlement in present-day Funza, used by the native Muisca; Bacatá, have been found. The estimated size of the South American hoofed mammal was that of a dog. Other fossilised fragments found in the Bogotá Formation are molds of Stephania palaeosudamericana and Menispina evidens.|$|E

Overlying the sandstones is the Neobolus Shale, which is composed of dark shales with a thickness of [...] Finally there is a zone consisting of red or purple sandstones having a thickness of [...] to [...] called the Purple Sandstone. These are unfossiliferous and show sun-cracks and worm burrows which are typical of subaerial weathering. The deposits in Spiti are known as the Haimanta system and they consist of slates, <b>micaceous</b> quartzite and dolomitic limestones. The Ordovician rocks comprise flaggy shales, limestones, red quartzites, quartzites, sandstones and conglomerates. Siliceous limestones belonging to the Silurian overlie the Ordovician rocks. These limestones are in turn overlain by white quartzite and this is known as Muth quartzite. Silurian rocks which contain typical Silurian fauna are also found in the Vihi district of Kashmir.|$|E

60|$|Careful {{experiments}} {{were made to}} ascertain whether the effect was produced through {{the sight of the}} caterpillar. The ocelli were covered with black varnish, but neither this, nor cutting off the spines of the tortoise-shell larva to ascertain whether they might be sense-organs, produced any effect on the resulting colour. Mr. Poulton concludes, therefore, that the colour-action probably occurs over the whole surface of the body, setting up physiological processes which result in the corresponding colour-change of the pupa. Such changes are, however, by no means universal, or even common, in protectively coloured pupae, since in Papilio machaon and some others which have been experimented on, both in this country and abroad, no change can be produced on the pupa by any amount of exposure to differently coloured surroundings. It is a curious point that, with the small tortoise-shell larva, exposure to light from gilded surfaces produced pupae with a brilliant golden lustre; and the explanation is supposed to be that mica abounded in the original habitat of the species, and that the pupae thus obtained protection when suspended against <b>micaceous</b> rock. Looking, however, at the wide range of the species and the comparatively limited area in which <b>micaceous</b> rocks occur, this seems a rather improbable explanation, and the occurrence of this metallic appearance is still a difficulty. It does not, however, commonly occur in this country in a natural state.|$|E
60|$|This axis {{is formed}} {{of a chain}} of {{mountains}} [F], of which the central masses (near La Punta) consist of andesite containing green hornblende and coppery mica, and the outer masses of greenish and black porphyries, together with some fine lilac-coloured claystone porphyry; all these porphyries being injected and broken up by small hummocks of andesite. The central great mass of this latter rock, is covered {{on the eastern side}} by a black, fine-grained, highly <b>micaceous</b> slate, which, together with the succeeding mountains of porphyry, are traversed by numerous white dikes, branching from the andesite, and some of them extending in straight lines, to a distance of at least two miles. The mountains of porphyry eastward of the <b>micaceous</b> schist soon, but gradually, assume (as observed in so many other cases) a stratified structure, and can then be recognised {{as a part of the}} porphyritic conglomerate formation. These strata [G] are inclined at a high angle to the S.E., and form a mass from fifteen hundred to two thousand feet in thickness. The gypseous masses to the west already described, dip directly towards this axis, with the strata only in a few places (one of which is represented in the section) thrown from it: hence this fourth axis is mainly uniclinal towards the S.E., and just like our third axis, only locally anticlinal.|$|E

The valley is very narrow, and the vegetation wholly tropical, consisting of two species of oak, several palms, rattan-cane (screw-pine), Pandanus, tall grasses, and all the natives of dense hot jungles. The river is a grand feature, broad, rocky, deep, swift, and broken by enormous boulders of rock; its waters were of a pale opal green, probably from the materials of the soft <b>micaceous</b> rocks through which it flows.|$|E
60|$|The river-terrace {{is in all}} respects {{similar to}} that at the {{junction}} of the Tambur and Khawa, but very extensive: the stones it contained were of all sizes, from a nut to huge boulders upwards of fifteen feet long, of which many strewed the surface, while others were {{in the bed of}} the river: all were of gneiss, quartz, and granite, and had doubtless been transported from great elevations, as the rocks in situ--both here and for several thousand feet higher up the river--were <b>micaceous</b> schists, dipping in various directions, and at all angles, with, however, a general strike to the north-west.|$|E
