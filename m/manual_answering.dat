40|$|Community Question Answering (CQA) {{sites such}} as Yahoo! Answers have emerged as rich {{knowledge}} resources for information seekers. However, answers posted to CQA sites can be irrelevant, incomplete, redundant, incorrect, biased, ill-formed or even abusive. Hence, automatic selection of “good ” answers for a given posted question is a practical research problem {{that will help us}} manage the quality of accumulated knowledge. One way to evaluate answer selection systems for CQA would be to use the Best Answers (BAs) that are readily available from the CQA sites. However, BAs may be biased, and even if they are not, there may be other good answers besides BAs. To remedy these two problems, we propose system evaluation methods that involve multiple answer assessors and graded-relevance information retrieval metrics. Our main findings from experiments using the NTCIR- 8 CQA task data are that, using our evaluation methods, (a) we can detect many substantial differences between systems that would have been overlooked by BA-based evaluation; and (b) we can better identify hard questions (i. e. those that are handled poorly by many systems and therefore require focussed investigation) compared to BAbased evaluation. We therefore argue that our approach is useful for building effective CQA answer selection systems despite the cost of <b>manual</b> <b>answer</b> assessments...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 155 - 161) Recently {{the need}} for quality child care has been of great public concern; however, the overall child care situation remains unchanged. The picture today reflects dramatically increasing demand for child care services, an inadequate number of available spaces in existing facilities, millions of children left without adult supervision, and no substantial support systems or direction for child care professionals. The need for organization, improved program quality and increased availability in the child care field is immediate. This project outlines the critical need for a child care answer, especially for a specific segment of the child care population, the school-age child. The project develops a theoretical background for a recreational program for school-age children, based on literature from related fields. The project presents a <b>manual</b> in <b>answer</b> {{to the question of}} quality care for school-age children. The manual represents a model program which utilizes recreation as the mechanism for providing a quality program. The administrative and legal concerns of establishing an agency are addressed as a guide to individuals wishing to create or improve a child care agency. The strength of the recreation program for school-age children lies in the program which the manual documents. The logistics of program implementation is supported by an extensive appendix to aid a child care practitioner in utilizing the recreation program. Topics of staffing and transportation are outlined and supported in a similar manner to provide a clear understanding of the key components in this successful recreational program for school-age children...|$|R

DeepQA is a question-and-answer, natural language processing system that can help professionals make critical and timely decisions [75]. The authors combined a Data-Level approach (<b>manual</b> question and <b>answer</b> vetting, over-sampling) with an Algorithm-Level approach (logistic regression with a regularization term) {{to address the issue}} of high-class imbalance. Adding a regularization term to logistic regression during the training phase has been shown to reduce the effect of class imbalance [74]. The dataset in this study contained approximately 720, 000 instances and 400 features, with a majority-to-minority class ratio of 6930 : 1. The results show that regularized logistic regression with over-sampling outperformed un-regularized logistic regression with over-sampling in terms of accuracy, which increased by 0.0158 – 0.28 (Table  4, Appendix A 2). This best value of accuracy is low. The results also show that the Data-Level techniques of vetting and over-sampling increased the recall rate. The skill level of the person doing the vetting is potentially a limiting factor for the method proposed by Baughman et al. [74]. For example, vetting done by a professional would most likely yield higher accuracy values than vetting done by a college student. Furthermore, apart from the logistic regression classifier, other classifiers should also be evaluated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Phylogenomic {{pipelines}} {{generate a}} large collection of phylogenetic trees that require <b>manual</b> inspection to <b>answer</b> questions about gene or genome evolution. A notable application of phylogenomics is to photosynthetic organelle (plastid) endosymbiosis. In {{the case of}} primary endosymbiosis, a heterotrophic protist engulfed a cyanobacterium, giving rise to the first photosynthetic eukaryote. Plastid establishment precipitated extensive gene transfer from the endosymbiont to the nuclear genome of the 'host'. Estimating {{the magnitude of this}} endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) and determining the functions of the prokaryotic genes remain controversial issues. We used phylogenomics to study EGT in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. To facilitate this procedure, we developed PhyloSort to rapidly search large collection of trees for monophyletic relationships. Here we present PhyloSort and its application to estimating EGT in Chlamydomonas. Results PhyloSort is an open-source tool to sort phylogenetic trees by searching for user specified subtrees that contain a monophyletic group of interest defined by operational taxonomic units in a phylogenomic context. Using PhyloSort, we identified 897 Chlamydomonas genes of putative cyanobacterial origin, of which 531 had bootstrap support values ≥ 50 % for the grouping of the algal and cyanobacterial homologs. Conclusion PhyloSort can be applied to quantify the number of genes that support different evolutionary hypotheses such as a taxonomic classification or endosymbiotic or horizontal gene transfer events. In our application, we demonstrate that cyanobacteria account for 3. 5 – 6 % of the protein-coding genes in the nuclear genome of Chlamydomonas. </p...|$|R
40|$|What {{does it mean}} to {{understand}} a program? What sorts of questions can be answered about a program? What background knowledge is required to answer them? What tools can help the process? To answer questions like these, we will look at an example of program understanding in action. Imagine the following scenario: You are assigned responsibility for maintaining a program you have never seen before. It is written in the FORTRAN language and is concerned with finding the roots of function. We will assume that you know the FORTRAN language but are not an expert at it. That is, you still have to occasionally look at the reference <b>manual</b> to <b>answer</b> questions about the language. We will also assume that you have a computer science background, either through formal education or by on-the-job experience, so that you know how to design and compose programs similar to the one you are about to maintain. Finally, we will assume that you have a passing acquaintance with numerical analysis, possibly from a course you took. Hence, you are familiar with the idea of finding a root of a function, but you would have to look up an actual algorithm in order to write a root-finding program yourself. As you are responsible for long-term maintenance of the program, you want {{to understand}} it better. So you decide to systematically read it. This is distinct from the situation where you have a specific task to accomplish, such as finding a bug, adding a new feature, or updating the program to conform to a change in the language or operating environment. In these cases, instead of systematic reading, you might direct your efforts to accomplishing the specific task. Here, we will assume {{that you are going to}} make a single, sequential pass through the program text, with perhaps a few side trips to answer small questions as they arise. The following program text is taken directly from its source [1]. We have added three digits of line numbers in the left margin for expository purposes; they are not part of the program itself. We will annotate each line in the program as we come to it. The idea is to express some idea of what that line is there for. Sometimes we will raise questions, sometimes we will generate hypotheses that need to be confirmed, and sometimes we will speculate about the application domain. The intent is to get a feel for the kinds of knowledge required to understand a program on a line-by-line basis...|$|R

The subject of this work was to find out how the mayors of small towns cope with homelessness and how it is possible to help people without shelter. In theoretical part I focused on setting the basic terms regarding the homelessness phenomenon. I mainly focused of the definitions of people without shelter, the homelessness phenomenon, typology and the reasons for homelessness and social exclusion as well. The description of social work with people without shelter and social work given to them is also included in this part. Further, it describes the development of legislation and regulations regarding homelessness. Practical part used qualitative research of inquiries and the technique of interviews according to <b>manual</b> to get <b>answers</b> to researched questions. I was granted 10 interviews with mayors in the districts of Přerov and Český Krumlov all together, five interviews with mayors in each district. The interviews took place at the end of January and the beginning of February 2012. The objective of bachelor thesis was to find out how the small towns deal with this problematic and what kind of provisions proved to work when solving the problem of homelessness in their municipality. The results of research show that the mayors have knowledge of the homelessness phenomenon and some of them have personal experience with it. Further, the results show that mayor would {{be able to deal with}} this phenomenon but they sated that none of the provisions worked in practical life to help people without shelter to get out of their difficult life situation. Bachelor thesis and its results can be a source of information for broad public and professionals as well as the students of health social faculty in České Budějovice learning social work...|$|R
5000|$|Returning to Lee's army after Early's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Cedar Creek, Gordon led the Second Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia {{until the end}} of the war. In this role, he defended the line in the Siege of Petersburg and {{commanded}} the attack on Fort Stedman on March 25, 1865 (where he was wounded again, in the leg). At Appomattox Court House, he led his men in the last charge of the Army of Northern Virginia, capturing the entrenchments and several pieces of artillery in his front just before the surrender. On April 12, 1865, Gordon's Confederate troops officially surrendered to Bvt. Maj. Gen. Joshua L. Chamberlain, acting for Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, recorded in moving detail by Chamberlain: The momentous meaning of this occasion impressed me deeply. I resolved to mark it by some token of recognition, which could be no other than a salute of arms. Well aware of the responsibility assumed, and of the criticisms that would follow, as the sequel proved, nothing of that kind could move me in the least. The act could be defended, if needful, by the suggestion that such a salute was not to the cause for which the flag of the Confederacy stood, but to its going down before the flag of the Union. My main reason, however, was one for which I sought no authority nor asked forgiveness. Before us in proud humiliation stood the embodiment of manhood: men whom neither toils and sufferings, nor the fact of death, nor disaster, nor hopelessness could bend from their resolve; standing before us now, thin, worn, and famished, but erect, and with eyes looking level into ours, waking memories that bound us together as no other bond; - was not such manhood to be welcomed back into a Union so tested and assured? Instructions had been given; and when the head of each division column comes opposite our group, our bugle sounds the signal and instantly our whole line from right to left, regiment by regiment in succession, gives the soldier's salutation, from the [...] "order arms" [...] to the old [...] "carry" [...] - the marching salute. Gordon at the head of the column, riding with heavy spirit and downcast face, catches the sound of shifting arms, looks up, and, taking the meaning, wheels superbly, making with himself and his horse one uplifted figure, with profound salutation as he drops the point of his sword to the boot toe; then facing to his own command, gives word for his successive brigades to pass us with the same position of the <b>manual,</b> - honor <b>answering</b> honor. On our part not a sound of trumpet more, nor roll of drum; not a cheer, nor word nor whisper of vain-glorying, nor motion of man standing again at the order, but an awed stillness rather, and breath-holding, as if it were the passing of the dead! Joshua L. Chamberlain ...|$|R
