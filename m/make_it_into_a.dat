5|$|The Bloomer {{became a}} fashion fad during the {{following}} months, as women from Toledo to New York City and Lowell, Massachusetts, held reform-dress social events and festivals. Supporters gathered signatures to a “Declaration of Independence from the Despotism of Parisian Fashion” and organized dress-reform societies. A few Garrisonian supporters of women’s rights took prominent part in these activities, and one offered silk to any of his friends who would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> short skirt and trousers for a public dress.

25|$|A {{few years}} later, {{following}} {{the success of}} The Good Life, Spence was asked by BBC Radio {{to come up with}} an idea for a programme to feature Keith. Thinking of Keith's character in The Good Life, Spence had the idea of an upper-class version of Margo Leadbetter and, from the account from the comedian, came up with Audrey fforbes-Hamilton. Instead of a Cockney comedian as the new owner of the manor, Spence decided on an American who sees the manor while in England looking for his roots. The American later discovers he is descended from the fforbes-Hamiltons. This was made into a radio pilot in 1976 with Bernard Braden as the American, but was never broadcast because of the interest to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> TV series.|$|E
25|$|Stroman's late husband, Mike Ockrent, {{had asked}} his {{employees}} to recommend material to be adapted into musicals during his two year production deal at Warner Bros. His assistant recommended the Zola novel, and began developing {{the idea in}} detail with the production executive. Later, when Warner Bros. passed on this, the idea and notes that were developed by Ockren't staff members were give to Stroman. Her original impulse was to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> ballet, but decided against it, and felt it could be strong enough as a musical. The idea for the musical Contact had also originally been developed at Ockrent's Warner Bros. office by the same two staff members, and then also offered over to Stroman by Ockrent when it didn't fly with the film studio.|$|E

Bosman had a quiet international year in 2008, playing just one Twenty20 against Bangladesh, {{and at the end of}} the 2008–09 domestic season moved from the Eagles to the Dolphins franchise in KwaZulu-Natal. Initially named in a provisional squad of 30 for the 2009 World Twenty20, he couldn't find a place in the final 15, but in November of that year he fell one blow short of what would have been, at the time, just the second international Twenty20 century.

25|$|In 1975, Saint Phalle {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} for Un rêve plus long que la nuit (A Dream Longer Than the Night, later also called Camélia et le Dragon), and she recruited {{many of her}} artist friends to help <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> film, a phantasmagorical tale of dragons, monsters, and adolescence. A young girl is held captive by a dragon, manages to escape, and must explore Sept Portes du Mystère ("Seven Doors of Mystery") to find love. Saint Phalle's daughter Laura was the lead character in the film, appearing with Saint Phalle, Jean Tinguely, and other artist friends; Peter Whitehead composed the music. For the filming, she designed several pieces of furniture, which were later displayed on {{the facade of the}} Palais des Beaux-Arts (Fine Arts Palace) in Brussels. From 1968-1988, she also worked on Last Night I Had a Dream, a sculptural relief painting that included many elements from her earlier life and dreams.|$|E
25|$|A {{perennial}} {{problem for}} the French Navy was the strategic priorities of France, which were first and foremost tied to its European ambitions. This reality meant that the army was often treated better than the navy, and as a result, the latter suffered in training and operational performance. The 18th century saw {{the beginning of the}} Royal Navy's domination, which managed to inflict a number of significant defeats on the French. However, in a very impressive effort, a French fleet under de Grasse managed to defeat a British fleet at the Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781, ensuring that the Franco-American ground forces would win the ongoing Siege of Yorktown. Beyond that, and Suffren's impressive campaigns against the British in India, there was not much more good news. The French Revolution all but crippled the French Navy, and efforts to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> powerful force under Napoleon were dashed at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where the British all but annihilated a combined Franco-Spanish fleet. The disaster guaranteed British naval domination {{until the end of the}} Napoleonic wars.|$|E
