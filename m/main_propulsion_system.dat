5|$|In {{addition}} to fuel and oxidizer systems, the launch vehicle's <b>main</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> is also {{equipped with a}} helium system consisting of ten storage tanks in {{addition to}} various regulators, check valves, distribution lines, and control valves. The system is used in-flight to purge the engine and provides pressure for actuating engine valves within the propellant management system and during emergency shutdowns. During entry, on the Space Shuttle, any remaining helium was used to purge the engines during reentry and for repressurization.|$|E
5|$|The RS-25 engine {{consists}} of various pumps, valves, and other components which work in concert to produce thrust. Fuel (liquid hydrogen) and oxidizer (liquid oxygen) from the Space Shuttle's external tank entered the orbiter at the umbilical disconnect valves {{and from there}} flowed through the orbiter's <b>main</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> (MPS) feed lines; whereas in the Space Launch System (SLS), fuel and oxidizer from the rocket's core stage will flow directly into the MPS lines. Once in the MPS lines, the fuel and oxidizer each branch out into separate paths to each engine (three on the Space Shuttle, four on the SLS). In each branch, prevalves then allow the propellants to enter the engine.|$|E
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's <b>main</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> (MPS), were ignited at Tâˆ’6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E

500|$|Salyut 6 ( [...] ; lit.Salute 6), DOS-5, was a Soviet orbital space station, {{the eighth}} flown {{as part of}} the Salyut programme. Launched on 29 September 1977 by a Proton rocket, the station {{was the first of the}} 'second-generation' type of space station. Salyut 6 possessed several revolutionary {{advances}} over the earlier Soviet space stations, which it nevertheless resembled in overall design. These included the addition of a second docking port, a new <b>main</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> and the station's primary scientific instrument, the BST-1M multispectral telescope. The addition of the second docking port made crew handovers and station resupply by unmanned Progress freighters possible for the first time. The early Salyut stations had no means of resupply or removing accumulated garbage (aside from the limited amount that cosmonauts could carry in their Soyuz spacecraft), nor could the propulsion system be refueled once it exhausted its propellant supply. Consequently, once the consumables launched with the station were used up, its mission had to be concluded and as a result, manned missions had a maximum duration of three months. Progress spacecraft could now bring fresh supplies and propellant and also be used to dispose of waste, which was then destroyed once the spacecraft was deorbited.|$|E
