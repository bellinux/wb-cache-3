5|$|Canada's strong {{attachment}} to the British Empire and Commonwealth led to major participation in British military efforts in the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II. Since then, Canada has been an advocate for <b>multilateralism,</b> making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations. During the Cold War, Canada was {{a major contributor to}} UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) in co-operation with the United States to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{independence}} from the United Kingdom grew gradually {{over the course of}} many years since the formation of the Canadian Confederation in 1867. World War I and World War II, in particular, gave rise to a desire among Canadians to have their country recognized as a fully-fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship. Legislative independence was established {{with the passage of the}} Statute of Westminster 1931, the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1946 took effect on January 1, 1947, and full sovereignty was achieved with the patriation of the constitution in 1982. Canada's nationality law closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom. Legislation since the mid-20th century represents Canadians' commitment to <b>multilateralism</b> and socioeconomic development.|$|E
5|$|No one {{government}} in the Commonwealth exercises power over the others, {{as is the case}} in a political union. Rather, the Commonwealth is an international organisation in which countries with diverse social, political, and economic backgrounds are regarded as equal in status, and cooperate within a framework of common values and goals, as outlined in the Singapore Declaration issued in 1971. Such common values and goals include the promotion of democracy, human rights, good governance, the rule of law, individual liberty, egalitarianism, free trade, <b>multilateralism,</b> and world peace, which are promoted through multilateral projects and meetings, such as the Commonwealth Games, held once every four years.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting {{both the}} realist and liberal {{paradigms}} {{of international relations}} and the conception of national interests, {{a number of other}} important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious. Such themes include: an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics, the centrality of notions of Westphalian sovereignty, a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a guarantor of security, and the proposition that the status quo in international affairs should only be changed peacefully. Likewise, <b>multilateralism,</b> collective security and defence self-reliance have also been important themes. Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history, being the product of Australian society's democratic political tradition and Judaeo-Christian Anglo-European heritage, as well its associated values, beliefs and economic, political and religious ideology. These behaviours are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island {{on the edge of the}} Asia-Pacific, and the geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power. To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars. Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers—known colloquially as Diggers—have often been noted, somewhat paradoxically, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities.|$|E

25|$|Brazil's {{foreign policy}} is a {{by-product}} of the country's unique position as a regional power in Latin America, a leader among developing countries, and an emerging world power. Brazilian foreign policy has generally been based {{on the principles of}} <b>multilateralism,</b> peaceful dispute settlement, and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries.|$|E
25|$|The Toledo {{administration}} held freetrade agreement {{talks with}} Singapore and Thailand, {{came to an}} agreement with Thailand on air transport, and signed an extradition treaty with South Korea. Foreign Minister García-Sayan visited China and discussed support for <b>multilateralism</b> and strengthening the UN. In 2004 China declared Peru an official tourist destination, and in 2005 the countries concluded several trade agreements.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1992, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{committed}} Canada to United Nations Operation in Somalia I (UNOSOM I). Canada was being pressured to make this decision because in the past it had aggressively engaged in Yugoslavia in 1992 and had reached out to Balkan refugees later that year. The heightened media coverage on Somalia had also put more pressure on the Canadian government to mobilize a peacekeeping effort. Thanks to the Mulroney government’s desire to improve conflict resolution mechanisms and for its natural interest in <b>multilateralism</b> and peacekeeping, Canada found the Somali Civil War to fit its foreign policy priorities. Mulroney was himself a ‘Pearsonian’ and a multilateralist who would {{have a great deal}} of confidence in the United Nations. Canadian diplomat Geoffrey Pearson argued that “effective multilateral arrangements provide a means to exert influence on major allies and powerful neighbours as well as help maintain peace”. Mulroney’s notion of new internationalism coupled with this notion of <b>multilateralism</b> would see intervention as a moral imperative in cases of intrastate disorder and large-scale human rights abuse. He commented that it would be ideal for the United Nations to become still more effective and more of an actor in international affairs.|$|E
25|$|After Confederation, and amid much controversy, a {{full-fledged}} Canadian military was created. Canada, however, remained a British dominion, and Canadian forces joined their British {{counterparts in the}} Second Boer War and the First World War. While independence followed the Statute of Westminster, Canada's links to Britain remained strong, and the British once again {{had the support of}} Canadians during the Second World War. Since then, Canada has been committed to <b>multilateralism</b> and has gone to war within large multinational coalitions such as in the Korean War, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, and the Afghan war. Canada has also {{played an important role in}} United Nations peacekeeping operations worldwide and has cumulatively committed more troops than any other country.|$|E
25|$|The {{foreign policy}} of Barack Obama was the {{foreign policy of}} the United States during his administration. Obama named his chief rival for the {{nomination}} Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State during his first term, with Massachusetts Senator John Kerry taking over the post in February 2013. Supporters of Obama's foreign policy applaud what they describe as his cooperation with allies and <b>multilateralism,</b> his ending of the Iraq War, his continuation {{of the process of}} ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, the administration's attempts at destroying al-Qaeda's core leadership, particularly the killing of Osama bin Laden; promoting discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, brokering a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalizing U.S. relations with Cuba.|$|E

2500|$|Cameron {{said that}} he {{believes}} in [...] "spreading freedom and democracy, and supporting humanitarian intervention" [...] in cases such as the genocide in Darfur, Sudan.

[...] A supporter of <b>multilateralism</b> as [...] "a country may act alone—but it cannot always succeed alone", he believes <b>multilateralism</b> can take the form of acting through [...] "NATO, the UN, the G8, the EU and other institutions", or through international alliances.

2500|$|However, {{local laws}} are usually enacted to satisfy {{domestic}} interests by legislators, who focus on keeping {{the support of}} their constituents, rather than on harmonising their own laws to conform to international principles.

2500|$|He {{was also}} famously an {{advocate}} of <b>multilateralism</b> {{as an alternative to}} American global hegemony following the collapse of the USSR {{and the end of the}} Cold War. Primakov called for a Russian foreign policy based on low-cost mediation while expanding influence towards the Middle East and the former Soviet republics. Beginning in 1999, he promoted Russia, China, and India as a [...] "strategic triangle" [...] to counterbalance the United States. The move was interpreted by some observers as an agreement to fight together against 'color revolutions' in Central Asia.|$|E

We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies {{in the hands of}} the embittered few," [...] and required [...] "defending the United States, the American people, and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asō {{was one of}} {{the final}} {{candidates}} to replace Koizumi as prime minister in 2006, but lost the internal party election to Shinzō Abe by a wide margin. Both Abe and Asō are conservative on foreign policy issues and have taken confrontational stances towards some East Asian nations, particularly North Korea and, to a lesser extent, the People's Republic of China. Abe was considered a more [...] "moderate" [...] politician than the more [...] "hard-line" [...] Asō, and led Asō in opinion polling within Japan. Asō's views on <b>multilateralism</b> are suggested in a 2006 speech, [...] "Arc of Freedom and Prosperity: Japan's Expanding Diplomatic Horizons".|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the title}} [...] "Shaping New Regional Governance in East Asia: A Common Vision for Mutual Benefit and Common Prosperity," [...] the 5th Jeju Peace Forum {{approached}} more broader concepts {{than in previous}} forums and held various sessions dealilng with braoder themes such as history, economy and international cooperation. The forum also addressed key security issues, such as North Korea's nuclear development, as well as nontraditional security issues, such as East Asia's historical antagonism, its use of soft power and other relevant events. The Secretary General Ban Ki-moon discussed about the three pillars of <b>multilateralism</b> in East Asia, such as security, economy and environment and their implications in the future.|$|E
2500|$|At the League of Nations in 1936, {{the emperor}} {{condemned}} {{the use of}} chemical weapons by Italy against his people during the Second Italo–Ethiopian War. [...] His internationalist views led to Ethiopia becoming a charter member of the United Nations, and his political thought and experience in promoting <b>multilateralism</b> and collective security have proved seminal and enduring. His suppression of rebellions among the landed aristocracy (the mesafint), which consistently opposed his reforms, {{as well as what}} some critics perceived to be Ethiopia's failure to modernize rapidly enough, earned him criticism among some contemporaries and historians. His regime was also criticized by human rights groups, such as Human Rights Watch, as autocratic and illiberal.|$|E
2500|$|Costin Ion Murgescu ( [...] ; October 27, 1919 – August 30, 1989) was a Romanian economist, jurist, {{journalist}} and diplomat. A supporter of fascism during his youth, {{he switched to}} communism {{by the end of}} World War II, and became an editor of the Communist Party daily organ, România Liberă. He taught at the University of Bucharest and worked for the Economic Research Institute. Having campaigned for <b>multilateralism</b> in world affairs as early as 1944, he helped to distance Romania from the Soviet Union after 1964, and later represented his country at the United Nations. He wrote extensively, publishing works on the effects of land reform and industrialization, on the history of economic thought, and on Romania's relations with the Comecon and the First World.|$|E
2500|$|As {{noted by}} {{historian}} Lucian Boia, Costin Murgescu had renounced his [...] "juvenile totalitarian illusions" [...] by January 1944, with Romania facing {{the possibility of}} a Soviet invasion. Contacting the anti-fascist circles, and finding himself in open conflict with his own father, Murgescu became a contributor to Ecoul, the semi-legal newspaper. It published his essays against Antonescu's economic policies and the New Order, which argued, with a noted [...] "dialectical" [...] tinge, in favor of <b>multilateralism</b> and an [...] "international division of labor". His Vremea articles, arranged for print by the antifascist editor George Ivașcu, looked forward to a new era of peace, shaped by international cooperation. According to Boia, he may have been encouraged to explore the subject by the Propaganda Ministry, which was sending out signals that some dignitaries were willing to sue for peace.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} end of the Second World War, the Cold War (1946–1991) began. The formal onset of the Cold War, is usually {{credited}} to the 1945 defection of a Soviet cipher clerk working in Ottawa, Igor Gouzenko. This was the first event that led to [...] "PROFUNC", a Government of Canada top secret plan to identify and detain communist sympathizers during the height of the Cold War. As a founding member of NATO and a signatory to the NORAD treaty with the US, Canada committed itself to the alliance against the Communist bloc. Canadian troops were stationed in Germany throughout the Cold War, and Canada joined with the Americans to erect defences against Soviet attack, such as the DEW Line. As a middle power, Canadian policy makers realized that Canada could do little militarily on its own, and thus a policy of <b>multilateralism</b> was adopted whereby Canada's international military efforts would be a part of a larger coalition. This led to Canada choosing to stay out of several wars despite the participation of close allies, most notably the Vietnam War and the Second Iraq War, although Canada lent indirect support and Canadian citizens served in foreign armies in both conflicts.|$|E
2500|$|In a March 2016 {{speech at}} the University of Ottawa, Dion used [...] "responsible conviction" [...] – a term syncretized {{from the work of}} German {{sociologist}} Max Weber – to describe the Trudeau government's foreign policy. Dion sought re-engagement with the world, including authoritarian regimes such as Russia and Iran and a focus on <b>multilateralism,</b> climate change, and the United Nations. Dion indicated that Canada would oppose capital punishment for Canadians imprisoned abroad and would change its contribution to the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant from providing airstrikes to providing special forces trainers. Dion also tied the concept of responsible conviction to continuing some policies of the previous Stephen Harper government in a modified manner, such as continuing its maternal and newborn health initiative but with new funding for abortion and family planning. He also justified continuing a $15 billion sale of light armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia despite its human rights abuses to protect Canadian jobs and preserve Canada's credibility in signing major international deals, but committed to reassessing the rules on Canadian export permits so that future deals would conform to Canadian interests such as human rights promotion. Dion ended his speech by rejecting the concept of Canada as an honest broker, because that term had become too associated with moral relativism and lack of conviction, instead saying that Canada had to be [...] "a fair-minded and determined peace builder." ...|$|E
