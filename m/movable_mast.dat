50|$|Raceboards {{are longer}} windsurf boards with a {{daggerboard}} and <b>movable</b> <b>mast</b> rail allowing the sailor to be efficient on all points of sail. Excellent upwind ability {{is combined with}} good reaching and even downwind ability typically sailed in an Olympic triangle course. Whilst in decline in manufacture {{since the advent of}} shortboard course racing (which evolved into Formula) there remains some models in production and most notably the IMCO One Design remains popular amongst amateur racing clubs.|$|E
40|$|Solar System Exploration camera {{implementations}} to date {{have involved}} either single cameras with wide field-of-view (FOV) and consequently coarser spatial resolution, cameras on a <b>movable</b> <b>mast,</b> or single cameras necessitating rotation of the host vehicle to afford visibility outside a relatively narrow FOV. These cameras require detailed commanding from the ground or separate onboard computers to operate properly, and are incapable of making decisions based on image content that control pointing and downlink strategy. For color, a filter wheel having selectable positions was often added, which added moving parts, size, mass, power, and reduced reliability. A system was developed based on a general-purpose miniature visible-light camera using advanced CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) imager technology. The baseline camera has a 92 FOV and six cameras are arranged in an angled-up carousel fashion, with FOV overlaps such that the system has a 360 FOV (azimuth). A seventh camera, also with a FOV of 92, is installed normal to {{the plane of the}} other 6 cameras giving the system a > 90 FOV in elevation and completing the hemispheric vision system. A central unit houses the common electronics box (CEB) controlling the system (power conversion, data processing, memory, and control software). Stereo is achieved by adding a second system on a baseline, and color is achieved by stacking two more systems (for a total of three, each system equipped with its own filter.) Two connectors {{on the bottom of the}} CEB provide a connection to a carrier (rover, spacecraft, balloon, etc.) for telemetry, commands, and power. This system has no moving parts. The system's onboard software (SW) supports autonomous operations such as pattern recognition and tracking...|$|E
