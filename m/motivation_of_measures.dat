In this study, we investigated the intentions (defined as level and orientation <b>of</b> <b>motivation)</b> <b>of</b> different performing students (low, average, and high performing students) to seek feedback in the clinical workplace using Self-Determination Theory.

40|$|Purpose - This study aims {{to examine}} the {{relationship}} between an implicit and an explicit <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>motivation</b> and <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> job and life satisfaction to provide a better understanding <b>of</b> workplace <b>motivation.</b> Design/methodology/approach - A survey is to be administered to 113 workers from a broad community sample. The survey contains <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> implicit <b>motivation</b> (multi motive grid-short version, MMG-S) and explicit motivation (needs assessment questionnaire, NAQ), job satisfaction and life satisfaction, and the core self-evaluation scale. Findings - Two types of confirmatory factor analyses allow us to examine the psychometric properties and convergent and discriminant validity between an implicit <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>motivation</b> and an explicit <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>motivation.</b> The data reveals that the implicit motivation variables assessed by the MMG-S are operationally distinct from those assessed by the explicit NAQ. A more detailed analysis reveals poor discriminant validity originating from the MMG-S variables. Regression analyses are conducted to assess the concurrent validity <b>of</b> both <b>measures</b> in influencing job and life satisfaction. Results reveal that although explicit motives are significantly linked to changes in satisfaction, implicit motives are not. Research limitations/implications - The study uses a cross-sectional design and therefore the results may be affected by common method variance. The study uses a convenience sample of workers.

This is done by providing feedback {{through the use of}} feedback tools. In this matter, the ability of actively seeking feedback is important. Therefore, it could be worthwhile to explore the difference in motivation between high (HP) and low (LP) performing students towards seeking feedback. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the difference in quantity and quality <b>of</b> <b>motivation</b> towards seeking feedback in the clinical workplace between HP and LP students. Methods: Participating students in their final years of their study at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University were used in this study (n= 87). These students collected feedback in a portfolio on their performance in clinical workplace. Using a mixed method study, the quantity <b>of</b> <b>motivation</b> was <b>measured</b> through counting the amount of mini-CEX forms a student collected (experiment 1). The quality <b>of</b> <b>motivation</b> was <b>measured</b> in a questionnaire based on the Self Determination Theory (experiment 2), combined with semi-structured interviews (experiment 3) to gain more in depth insights. HP and LP students were differentiated using the received grade on their portfolio assessment. Results: The multiple regression model showed that HP students collected significant more mini-CEX forms form both supervisors and peers (p< 0, 01; experiment 1). The questionnaire (response rate: 54 %; experiment 2) had sufficient reliability and represented the experimental group. The Kruskal-Wallis test found a significant difference concerning autonomous motivation (p= 0, 003), intrinsic motivation (p= 0, 007), identified regulation (p= 0, 003) and external regulation (p= 0, 017).

The discriminative power of the LSFM feature was verified in terms of the separateness of its distribution for noisy speech and non-speech signals. The decision threshold was adapted according to the previous 100 LSFM <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> speech and non-speech. Experiments were done on core TIMIT test set for 12 kinds of noises (11 from NOISEX- 92 database and speech-shaped noise) across five different SNRs ranging from − 10 to 10 dB. No a priori knowledge of noise characteristics was needed for training purposes. The performance of our proposed method was compared with the three standards (namely G. 729 B, AMR 1, and AMR 2) and with an emerging LTSV-based VAD algorithm. The results were analyzed by accuracy rate and error rate. Through extensive experiments, we showed that our proposed LSFM-based VAD achieved the best CORRECT, HR 0, and NDS and among all tested schemes that averaged all 12 kinds of noises. Furthermore, we investigated the individual performance on each noise type. Our proposed LSFM-based VAD outperformed LTSV-based VAD for 6 out of 12 noise types tested especially for non-stationary impulsive machine gun noise and speechlike babble noise.|$|R

Adopters of organic farming systems and (to a lesser degree) adopters of nitrogen reduction are motivated for landscape quality and nature preservation.
