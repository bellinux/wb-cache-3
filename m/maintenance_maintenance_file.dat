File replication methods indicate replica nodes without thinking about consistency <b>maintenance</b> which may lead to high overhead for redundant <b>file</b> replications and consistency <b>maintenance.</b> Consistency <b>maintenance</b> methods update <b>files</b> without considering file replication dynamism which may not give the accuracy of replica consistency. Hence {{there is a need}} to think about consistency <b>maintenance</b> while <b>file</b> replication to achieve high performance and high availability. When data files are replicated at many nodes, consistency must be maintained among the nodes. In this paper we point out different replication strategies that are applied P 2 P systems, followed by consistency <b>maintenance</b> techniques intended for high performance and high availability of data. Finally we explore a combined method of <b>file</b> replication and consistency <b>maintenance...</b>|$|R

As it is well-known, this one is the most costly stage and less planneable stage of the software life cycle. This methodology approaches <b>maintenance</b> as an horizontal set of activities and tasks (in the sense that they have an extension along the time) and proposes, for each task, the use of certain techniques, which can have been extracted from literature or have been propounded as additional work lines of this research. This full set of solutions is being used by a multinational organization which provides software <b>maintenance</b> services to third-party software systems.
