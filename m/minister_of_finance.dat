5|$|During Western Han, the Minister of Finance's {{powers were}} limited to the public treasury, the Minister Steward being {{responsible}} for the emperor's private wealth. However, in Eastern Han, the responsibilities for the public treasury and the emperor's private wealth were amalgamated and entrusted solely to the <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finance,</b> which later proved disastrous when handled by irresponsible emperors such as Ling (r. 168–189 AD). During Western Han, the <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finance</b> managed the government's monopolized salt and iron agencies, which were abolished during Eastern Han and transferred to local administrations and private entrepreneurship. He also managed the government's brief monopoly over liquor from 98–81 BC, before it was returned to private production. Although the Minister Steward and then the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks managed the imperial mint for issuing standard coins during Western Han, in Eastern Han the imperial mint {{was transferred to the}} office of the <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finance.</b>|$|E

He served from 6 December 1947 to 19 November 1951, when Torp's Cabinet was formed. Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen and former party secretary Martin Tranmæl were the architects behind his appointment. Ultimately, Meisdalshagen's {{opposition to the}} Labour Party's foreign and defence policy in general, and extraordinary monetary grants for defence measures specifically, was cited {{as the reason for}} his resignation from the cabinet, and even for the entire cabinet shift. During his period as minister, Meisdalshagen's parliamentary seat was occupied by Gunnar Kalrasten until June 1948 and then by Thorvald Ulsnæs. He was succeeded as <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finance</b> by Trygve Bratteli; other candidates were discussed but rejected, including Meisdalshagen's old acquaintance Klaus Sunnanå.|$|E

He succeeded Gostev to become <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finance</b> in Ryzhkov's government in 1989 and {{his time in the}} post was considered uncontroversial, even though Lira Rozenova, Deputy Chairman of the State Committee for Prices, was not elected to the post of Chairman of the State Committee for her advocacy of Pavlov-backed plans for centrally administered price reform. He was the only minister in Ryzhkov's Government who was {{also a member of the}} Presidium of the Council of Ministers.|$|E
5|$|Since commandery-issued coins {{were often}} of {{inferior}} quality and lighter weight, {{the central government}} closed commandery mints and monopolized the issue of coinage in 113 BC.

Bokassa rewarded Banza by appointing him as minister of state and <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> in the new government. Banza quickly established the new regime's reputation abroad and forged diplomatic relations with other countries. In 1967, Bokassa and his protégé had a major argument over the president's extravagances. In April 1968, Bokassa removed Banza as <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance.</b> Recognizing Bokassa's attempts to undermine him, Banza {{made a number of}} remarks highly critical of the president's handling of the government. Bokassa responded by abolishing the minister of state position.|$|E

5|$|The {{first few}} years of the {{federation}} were characterised by a relatively peaceful political atmosphere and a booming economy. The government's coffers were kept full through revenue from Northern Rhodesia's copper mines, and overseas investment saw the rapid expansion of the cities of Salisbury, Bulawayo and Lusaka. High-standard tar roads replaced dirt tracks and the railway system was expanded.

Many believed that the natural-born leader would not remain as Bokassa's right-hand man for much longer.
