5|$|Altgens recovered, and {{his next}} {{photograph}} showed the First Lady {{with her hand}} on the vehicle's trunk lid and Secret Service agent Clint Hill standing on the bumper behind her as the driver had begun to accelerate. This photograph was quickly reproduced on the front pages of newspapers around the world. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> testified the following June that she was aware of the image, but had no memory of her actions. Hill later wrote that this picture would forever identify him as the Secret Service agent {{on the back of the}} limousine.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interest}} of time (the striking of the new coin was to begin in January 1964), Roberts modified the existing bust of Kennedy he had created for use on the Kennedy medal in the Mint's Presidential series, while Frank Gasparro began modifications to the reverse he had created for the same medal. Both Roberts' and Gasparro's designs had been approved by Kennedy. Roberts had met with Kennedy in person to show him early models of the design; although the President expressed no opinion regarding the depiction, Roberts decided {{to make some changes}} after meeting him. After the Mint produced trial strikes, Jacqueline and Robert Kennedy were invited to view them. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> viewed the designs favorably, but suggested that the hair be altered slightly. It was also suggested that a full or half figure of the president be used instead of the profile, but Roberts noted that there was not enough time to produce an entirely new design because of the project's time constraints, and also that he believed the left profile would give a more attractive appearance.|$|E
25|$|President Kennedy {{was assassinated}} on November 22, 1963, and Warnecke {{was chosen by}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> to design the president's tomb just six days later on November 28. Coincidentally, the President and Warnecke had visited the site which was to become Kennedy's tomb in March 1963, and the President had admired the {{peaceful}} atmosphere of the place. On November 24, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> told friends that she wanted an eternal flame at the gravesite.|$|E
25|$|Following the State Funeral for President John F. Kennedy, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> {{received}} foreign {{heads of}} state in the Red Room.|$|E
25|$|After the President {{had been}} shot in the head, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> began to climb out onto the back of the limousine, though she later had no {{recollection}} of doing so. Hill believed she was reaching for something, perhaps a piece of the President's skull. He jumped onto the back of the limousine while at the same time <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> returned to her seat, and he clung to the car as it exited Dealey Plaza and accelerated, speeding to Parkland Memorial Hospital.|$|E
25|$|The Kennedy {{assassination}} spotlighted the bravery of two Secret Service agents. First, {{an agent}} protecting <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> Clint Hill, was {{riding in the}} car directly behind the presidential limousine when the attack began. While the shooting continued, Hill leapt from the running board of the car he was riding on and jumped {{onto the back of}} the President's moving car and guided <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> from the trunk back into the rear seat of the car. He then shielded the President and the First Lady with his body until the car arrived at the hospital.|$|E
25|$|John Carl Warnecke, {{a friend}} of the Kennedys, visited the grave with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy on Thursday, November 28, to discuss themes and plans for a {{permanent}} memorial. The following day, Warnecke was chosen by <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> to design the president's tomb. Warnecke immediately concluded that the permanent grave must be simple and must incorporate the eternal flame. A few days later, Warnecke agreed that, although it was not required, he would submit the design for the permanent Kennedy grave site to the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts.|$|E
25|$|The first White House guidebook was {{produced}} {{under the direction}} of curator Lorraine Waxman Pearce with direct supervision from <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy.</b> Sale of the guidebook helped finance the restoration.|$|E
25|$|The {{permanent}} John F. Kennedy {{grave site}} opened with little announcement or fanfare at 7:00 AM on March 15, 1967, in a driving rain. The ceremony, which took 20 minutes, {{was attended by}} President Lyndon B. Johnson, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> {{and members of the}} Kennedy family.|$|E
25|$|The autopsy was {{performed}} at the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland; the procedure began at about 8p.m. and ended at about midnight EST. The choice of autopsy hospital in the Washington, D.C., area was made {{at the request of}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> on the basis that John F. Kennedy had been a naval officer during World War II.|$|E
25|$|As the Vice President's wife, Lady Bird often {{served as}} a {{substitute}} for Jacqueline Kennedy at official events and functions. Within her first year as Second Lady, she had substituted for <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> at more than 50 events, roughly one per week. This experience prepared Lady Bird for the following challenges of her unexpected years as First Lady.|$|E
25|$|Once back at Air Force One, {{and only}} after <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> and President Kennedyâ€™s body had also {{returned}} to the plane, Lyndon Johnson was sworn in by Sarah T. Hughes as the thirty-sixth President of the United States of America at 2:38p.m. CST. One of President Kennedy's aides stayed with his coffin during the swearing-in of Johnson.|$|E
25|$|Warnecke {{visited the}} grave with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy on Wednesday, November 28, to discuss themes {{and plans for}} the grave.

A few days later, Warnecke agreed that, {{although it was not}} required, he would submit the design for the permanent Kennedy grave site to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of November 22, 1963, Carr and his wife, the former Ernestine Story (born April 22, 1920, in Wylie), were among the dignitaries who ate breakfast with President and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> in Fort Worth. The {{president}} went on to Dealey Plaza in Dallas, and the Carrs flew to the Texas Panhandle for a speaking engagement. Carr learned of the tragic consequences in Dallas as his plane landed.|$|E
25|$|Boudin and du Pont also competed {{to design}} window {{treatments}} for the Red Room. Boudin suggested straight panels of cerise silk, suspended from a gilded wood rod and rings. Du Pont proposed a lighter treatment of white cotton voile or muslin, drawn {{back from the}} windows with tassels. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> was concerned that du Pont's drapes would require constant pressing in order to look good, and that souvenir-hunters might snip at the tassels and fringe. Boudin's scheme won out.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, she {{starred in}} a short revival of the musical Brigadoon at the New York City Opera and {{received}} a Tony nomination, the first performer to be nominated for a revival performance. She recreated the role in a private White House performance at the express invitation of President and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy.</b> In 1964 she starred on Broadway opposite Robert Alda and Steve Lawrence in the energetic What Makes Sammy Run?, which lasted for over 500 performances.|$|E
25|$|The {{plane that}} served as Air Force One {{at the time of}} the {{assassination}} is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. The museum offers tours of the aircraft that include the rear of the aircraft where President Kennedy's casket was placed and the location where <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> stood in her blood-stained pink dress while Vice President Johnson was sworn in as president. The 1961 Lincoln Continental limousine is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, American President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy {{paid their}} respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, {{accompanied}} by French President Charles de Gaulle. After the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Kennedy</b> remembered the eternal flame at the Arc de Triomphe and requested that an eternal flame be placed {{next to her}} husband's grave at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. President Charles de Gaulle went to Washington to attend the state funeral, and witnessed Jacqueline Kennedy lighting the eternal flame that had been inspired by her visit to France.|$|E
25|$|According to the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Kennedy {{was waving}} to the crowds {{on his right}} with his right arm upraised {{on the side of}} the limo when a shot entered his upper back, {{penetrated}} his neck and slightly damaged a spinal vertebra and the top of his right lung. The bullet exited his throat nearly centerline just beneath his larynx and nicked the left side of his suit tie knot. He raised his elbows and clenched his fists in front of his face and neck, then leaned forward and left. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> facing him, then put her arms around him in concern.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{was quickly}} {{sworn in as}} President on Air Force One in Dallas on November 22, 1963, just 2 hours and 8 minutes after John F. Kennedy was assassinated, amid suspicions of a {{conspiracy}} against the government. He was sworn in by U.S. District Judge Sarah T. Hughes, a family friend. In the rush, a Bible was not at hand, so Johnson took {{the oath of office}} using a Roman Catholic missal from President Kennedy's desk. Cecil Stoughton's iconic photograph of Johnson taking the presidential oath of office as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> looks on is the most famous photo ever taken aboard a presidential aircraft.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday, November 24, 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy {{requested}} {{an eternal}} flame for her husband's grave. According to several published accounts, she {{drew inspiration from}} a number of sources. One was the eternal flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, which {{she and her husband had}} seen during a visit to France in 1961. She also took inspiration from the novel The Candle in the Wind (the fourth book from the collection The Once and Future King by T. H. White), which was part of the inspiration for the 1960 stage musical Camelot (the cast recording was a favorite of the Kennedys). Her brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, counseled against an eternal flame, worried that it might appear ostentatious or that it would compete with other such memorials at Arlington National Cemetery. But <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> was adamant.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy began a major {{refurbishment}} of the White House {{that included the}} Green Room. Her renovation was technically overseen by an advisory Committee on Fine Arts made up of museum professionals as well as wealthy individuals interested in antiques. American antiques autodidact Henry Francis du Pont (an expert in Federal furniture) led this committee. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> also brought in French interior designer StÃ©phane Boudin (an advocate of French interior design) and his company, Maison Jansen, to oversee the refurbishment. Although du Pont and Boudin often competed with one another for control of redecoration of a space in the White House, the Green Room represents an area where they cooperated more closely. This was because the Green Room {{had a long history}} as a Federal-style room, an area in which du Pont and his committee were experts. The Green Room was the first room in the White House to be redesigned almost completely with the input of the committee.|$|E
25|$|Walton {{also played}} {{critical}} roles {{following the death}} of John F. Kennedy. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. His body was taken to Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, for an autopsy. Jacqueline and Robert F. Kennedy were escorted to a VIP suite on the 17th floor of the hospital. As the evening wore on, the family began making plans for the funeral. Jacqueline Kennedy vaguely remembered an engraving of the catafalque on which President Abraham Lincoln's coffin had rested while he lay in repose. Robert Kennedy telephoned the White House, and at about 10:00 P.M. relayed the message that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> wanted the same bier. Officials at the Library of Congress quickly looked up reports of Lincoln's funeral, and a Lincoln funeral scholar identified the most accurate ones. Walton looked at a copy of Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper and Harper's Weekly, chose an engraving from Harper's, and began sketching the bier and funerary decorations. Military carpenters, unaware that the original Lincoln catafalque was stored in the Capitol building and that a replica was also available, began constructing one from Walton's sketches.|$|E
25|$|The {{permanent}} John F. Kennedy {{grave site}} opened with little announcement or fanfare on March 15, 1967. A few days before, the eternal flame {{had been moved}} from its temporary location to the new site. The reburial of the bodies occurred {{on the evening of}} March 14, after Arlington National Cemetery had closed. Earth over the existing grave was removed, and a small crane was used to lift the burial vault (which remained unopened) from the old grave and place it in the new one. The event was unannounced. The transfer was witnessed by Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Cardinal Richard Cushing of Boston. Exhumation began at 6:19 PM and was complete at 9:00 PM. Consecration of the new burial site occurred at 7:00 AM on March 15, 1967, in a driving rain. The ceremony, which took 20 minutes, was attended by President Lyndon B. Johnson, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> and members of the Kennedy family. Cardinal Cushing presided over the consecration. The final cost of the entire project was $2.2 million.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} ready for review and {{presentation}} to Congressional leaders when Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963. A few days after President Kennedy's funeral, President Lyndon B. Johnson met with Jacqueline Kennedy in the Oval Office and asked {{what he could do}} for her. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> requested two things: That Cape Canaveral be renamed for her husband, and that the Pennsylvania Avenue redevelopment plan move forward. Word of the request leaked to the public, and Johnson publicly supported the area's redevelopment on October 24, 1964. Johnson subsequently approved the establishment of a Temporary President's Commission on Pennsylvania Avenue (composed of Cabinet members, federal planners, architects, and others) to move the plan forward, although it did not hold its first meeting until May 21, 1965. The Temporary Commission's goal was to push for a permanent body with the legal authority to engage in condemnation and force public and private bodies to conform to its plans. Before the Temporary Commission was named, District of Columbia officials agreed to abandon plans to build an office building west of the District Building, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agreed to reorient its planned headquarters more squarely with Pennsylvania Avenue.|$|E
500|$|The {{newly elected}} Kennedy {{administration}} indicated on February 16, 1961, {{that it was}} anxious to retain the existing historic homes on Lafayette Square. In November, the Committee of 100 on the Federal City (an influential group of city leaders) asked President Kennedy to save and restore all the remaining buildings on Lafayette Square. In February 1962, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy lobbied General Services Administration (GSA) director Bernard L. Boutin to stop the demolition and adopt a different design plan. [...] "The wreckers haven't started yet, and until they do it can be saved," [...] she wrote. [...] <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> enlisted architect John Carl Warnecke, a friend of her husband's {{who happened to be}} in town that weekend, to create a design which would incorporate the new buildings with the old. Warnecke conceived the basic design over that weekend, and worked closely with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> {{over the next few months}} to formalize the design proposal. The design was presented to the public and the Commission of Fine Arts (which had approval over any plan) in October 1962, and with Mrs. Kennedy's backing the Commission adopted the revised Warnecke design proposal.|$|E
500|$|Pei's first {{proposed}} design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant {{to represent the}} optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the US. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the {{first proposed}} site for the building, {{as soon as the}} project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby Harvard Square. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort. These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. [...] "I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened the door {{at the end of the}} day," [...] she said. [...] "His footsteps were dragging. It was very hard for I.M. to see that so many people didn't want the building." ...|$|E
2500|$|After <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> crawled {{back into}} her {{limousine}} seat, both Governor Connally and Mrs. Connally heard her say more than once, [...] "They have killed my husband," [...] and [...] "I have his brains in my hand." [...] In a long-redacted interview for Life magazine days later, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> recalled, [...] "All the ride to the hospital I kept bending over him saying, 'Jack, Jack, can you hear me?

2500|$|Conger {{also added}} several major pieces by Scottish-born New York cabinetmaker Duncan Phyfe. They include {{a pair of}} work tables, side chairs with scroll arms, two card tables, {{and a pair of}} window benches. These {{replaced}} the more delicate Federal-era furniture approved by du Pont and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy.</b> On the west wall above a Duncan Phyfe sofa, Conger hung a pair of gilded girandole [...] "bullseye" [...] wall sconces.|$|E
2500|$|Ruby's {{explanation}} for killing Oswald would be [...] "exposed â€¦ as a fabricated legal ploy", {{according to the}} House Select Committee on Assassinations. In a private note {{to one of his}} attorneys, Joseph Tonahill, Ruby wrote: [...] "Joe, you should know this. My first lawyer Tom Howard told me to say that I shot Oswald so that Caroline and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> wouldn't have to come to Dallas to testify. OK?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of November 26, the site was {{surrounded}} by a white picket fence. The fencing covered an expanded area [...] long by [...] wide. The enlarged site was due to the wish of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> to inter her two deceased children next to their father. (In addition to Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> had given birth to Arabella, a stillborn daughter in 1956.) She had read that President Abraham Lincoln had been buried next to his deceased son, Willie Lincoln, and she recalled her husband's desire to be buried with his family. Mrs. Kennedy's mother, Janet Auchincloss, oversaw the disinterment of the daughter in Newport, Rhode Island, while Cardinal Richard Cushing (a long-time friend of the family) supervised the disinterment of Patrick Kennedy in Massachusetts. The two caskets were flown to Washington, D.C., accompanied by Mrs. Auchincloss, and the children buried next to their father on December 5, 1963. A small white cross was placed {{at the head of the}} daughter's grave, and a small white headstone placed at the head of Patrick Kennedy's grave.|$|E
2500|$|During Walton's tenure on the CFA, {{he helped}} to save the {{historic}} buildings around Lafayette Square. Various plans for the city included razing the historic old homes around the square, such as the Cutts-Madison House and the Tayloe House. Although demolition of the structures around the square was due to begin in 1962, Jacqueline Kennedy wanted the buildings saved. [...] "The wreckers haven't started yet, and until they do it can be saved," [...] she wrote. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> enlisted her architect friend, John Carl Warnecke, to design new buildings that would preserve and integrate the historic structures. Warnecke conceived the basic design over a single weekend, and worked closely with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kennedy</b> {{over the next few}} months to formalize the design proposal. The design was presented to the public and the Commission of Fine Arts in October 1962, and with Mrs. Kennedy's backing the commission adopted the revised Warnecke design proposal. Over the next few years, Walton shepherded the design through the CFA, working closely with Jacqueline Kennedy throughout the process. Walton won restoration of the historic buildings and forced the redesign of the square so that its pathways matched the facades of the new buildings facing it.|$|E
