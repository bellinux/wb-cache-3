40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Live-animal <b>micro-computed</b> {{tomography}} {{is a new}} {{and promising}} technique {{that can be used}} to quantify changes in bone volume for periodontal disease models. The major aim of this study was to develop the methodology of live-animal <b>micro-computed</b> tomography and to determine the effect of a novel secretory phospholipase A 2 inhibitor on alveolar bone loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Periodontitis was induced in mice by oral infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis over a period of 13 wk, and live-animal <b>micro-computed</b> tomography scans were taken at different time-points to determine bone volume changes with disease progression. This enabled conclusions to be made as to when treatment was most likely to be effective. In addition, the model was used to investigate a novel drug, the secretory phospholipase A 2 inhibitor, KHO 64, and its potential ability to inhibit osteoclast bone resorption and treat periodontitis. RESULTS: The results from live-animal <b>micro-computed</b> tomography scans revealed greater, statistically significant, bone volume loss in diseased mice compared with normal mice (p < 0. 05). This corresponded to a larger area from the cemento-enamel junction to the alveolar bone crest, as assessed by stereo imaging (p < 0. 001). These techniques can therefore detect and quantify alveolar bone loss. Both methods revealed that KHO 64 had no significant effect on the volume of bone resorption. CONCLUSION: Live-animal <b>micro-computed</b> tomography is a robust, reproducible technique that clearly demonstrates significant time-dependent changes in alveolar bone volume in a small-animal model of periodontitis.

40|$|Microleakage is an {{important}} topic in restorative dentistry. A large number of different techniques {{have been developed for}} the investigation of microleakage. However, these methodologies have been considered less reliable {{due to the nature of}} specimen preparation. The major objective of this investigation was to introduce a non-destructive technique for the study of microleakage. This objective has been partly met with the use of <b>micro-computed</b> tomography. By scanning the whole restoration with high spatial resolution, microleakage could be detected non-destructively and three dimensionally. In order to detect microleakage by <b>micro-computed</b> tomography, an X-ray contrast dye solution was developed to reveal microleakage at the tooth/restoration interface. In addition, a suitable model of tooth/cavity complex was designed in order to gain the best resolution from <b>micro-computed</b> tomography.

C. pp. 11 - 15, Oct. 1984. The rapid {{advances}} {{occurring in}} interactive <b>micro-computing</b> {{and computer science}} have provided the engineer with a powerful means of processing, storing, retrieving, and displaying data. The effective use of computer technology in engineering processes and applications is recognized {{by many as the}} key to increased individual, company, and national productivity. The implications of this observation for the academic community are clear: we must prepare our students to use computer methods and applications as part of their fundamental education. The proper tradeoff between engineering fundamentals and computer science principles and practices is changing with many of the concepts of engineering now being packaged in algorithms or on computer chips. The components of an education should include operating system fundamentals, data structures, program control and organization, algorithms, and computer architectures. It is critically important for engineering students to receive an education that teaches them these fundamentals. This paper suggests that to convey the essentials of computer science to future engineers requires, in part, the addition of computer courses to the engineering curriculum. It also requires a strengthening of the computing content of many other courses so that students come to treat the computer as a fundamental component of their work. This is a major undertaking, but new engineers graduating with advanced computing knowledge will provide potentially significant future innovations in the engineering professio...|$|E
40|$|Filipa Subtil and Pedro Xavier Mendonça {{analyses}} the technicizing {{impact of}} networks {{on the idea}} of communication and the influence of the network ideal on the current direction of technology in the service of power and economic advantage. Communication networks, in the Saint-Simonian ideal of the technical network, reduce the distances between classes and peoples, in that they involve people and society. The operation of democracy, itself inherent in and driven by networks, allows this process to take place, as a symbol and vehicle for democracy and equality. Subtil and Mendonça draw {{on the development of the}} media to illustrate how the information revolution made possible by networks has become the axis of a new capitalism, and stress the significance of three factors: the consolidation of nations with the introduction of the telegraph; the standardization and industrialization of news procedures; and the institutionalization of the press as an engine of power and economic intervention. With the computer and <b>micro-computing,</b> social life has expanded and knowledge have become disseminated, and the Saint-Simonian ideal of world networks has acquired concrete form in the new era of information. Subtil and Mendonça see this trend in Michel Chevalier. While pointing out that there is no straight line from the Saint-Simonian tradition of technical networks to the current shape of technology as an instrument for seeking power and profit, they demonstrate how the libertarian and liberal ideal present in Saint-Simonianism in the person of Chevalier enables (and advocates) information capitalism. The irreducible nature of the relationship between technical and political networks is explained by the allusion to a technological utopianism of the Promethean type and by consumption. The utopian disposition is the representational aspect of network dynamics, reflecting the projection of an ideal and the search for its realization. In combining the imaginary and realization, involving individual persons in the attraction of their promises, the network lends itself to idolatry as a symbol of social change and acquires ideological content. The cult of networks and the technological sublime reflect the idea that technology is sufficient unto itself as a political goal. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Whilst {{the story}} of {{technological}} change and de-unionisation in the newspaper industry in the UK is generally well known, the parallel changes in the magazine industry have not been subject to such academic interest. The magazine industry underwent a profound transformation from the 1980 s, driven both by organisational and technological change. Subject to different drivers of technological change {{to that of the}} newspaper industry, union responses were more fragmented and emergent. These responses were markedly different from those of unions in the more regulated newspaper industry, as magazine publishing companies were quite heterogeneous, often smaller, implying closer and more pragmatic relationships between firms and labour. The paper first outlines the development of the British print unions serving both the newspaper and magazines sectors. In particular the paper uses a review of hereto unexamined documents relating to the print firms, such as Odhams (Watford) Ltd, within the IPC magazine publishing conglomerate, and examines how technological change in the magazine sector was driven not by changes in printing technology, but by ultimately by developments in the <b>micro-computing</b> industry and the desire to enforce the “right of managers to manage. ” In contrast to this many of the smaller entrants into the industry developed a different relationship with labour unions. The advent of desk-top publishing (DTP) systems undermined both basis of demarcation in the labour force, and of the organisation of production. The main unions involved, the NUJ, NGA and SOGAT, found that the boundaries between their responsibilities were eroded. The unions involved underwent a period of restructuring, where several of the unions merged (or failed to merge) and consolidation in response to technological change, which had many implications to how the unions positioned themselves and approached issues such as collective agreements and training. Within smaller firms however the unions had put working arrangements in place to overcome the technologically-driven erosion of demarcation. In conclusion the differences between changes in the newspaper print business, print relationships at IPC and within the sector more generally are contrasted. What emerges is a different story of change in the print sector to that which is generally given for the 1980 s period, adding to a more subtle and contextualised story of how labour unions have adapted to technological and organisation change. This may serve to reposition debates on print union change from more politically-driven narratives of government-union conflict based in industrial relations approaches, towards a more productive domain of debate located in employment relations models as outlined by Belnave and Mortimer (2005.) This approach negates the excessive managerialist approach of HRM focused on worker flexibility, but acknowledges the positive outcomes of widening industry participation beyond unionised workers. With digitisation currently fuelling debate on the changing the nature of employment relations in the industry this story outlines how many of these issues were addressed by the actors involved in the 1980 s and 1990 s, and reveals that for print relations, the past could be the future...|$|E

40|$|PROGEFIA (Programme General de Formation en Information Agricole/General Programme for Training in Agricultural Information) is an {{innovation}} in agricultural information training, which involves a pooling of all available resources and {{which aims to}} improve North-South and South-South cooperation. PROGEFIA {{is based on the}} voluntary participation of the prime movers in the development of agricultural information systems in developing countries. It came into being because of a common wish to overcome the inadequate training of librarians and agricultural documentalists - a need which was identified during an international meeting on training in agricultural information in Rome in June 1988. This gathering asked CTA to draw up a strategy for a training programme for librarians and agricultural documentalists. which could serve as a basis for a united plan of action. The strategy was discussed by experts in this field who met at Libreville, Gabon, at the end of December 1989. Their brief was to see how the results and recommendations of the Rome meeting could be translated into action and to identify the most urgent needs in the developing countries for training in agricultural information. The second objective of the Libreville symposium was to study how best to match supply to demand for training and how to set up PROGEFIA in as short a time as possible and finally, to consider how it might develop in the short and medium term. Agricultural infommation is a necessary component of any plan for the improvement of agricultural productivity. At present national and regional information services can only make a very limited contribution to solving development problems and, for this reason, the symposium made agricultural information training a top priority in the development of national and regional infrastructures. All interested institutions (agricultural, agricultural information science, professional associations) were invited to set up the administrative mechanisms, both nationally and regionally, which would permit their participation in PROGEFIA and to identify in detail their needs in the field of training so that PROGEFIA could start working on its objectives immediately. Given the importance of the subject in the policies of the developing ACP countries, the symposium also recommended that information science colleges or courses should include Agricultural Information Training programmes in their regular training or higher training syllabuses. Any such new direction must require the academic authorities to give their syllabuses the weight of Universities of Development'. Pittsburgh University has unique experience in the field of agricultural information training and has offered to share this with developing countries. Therefore the symposium urged that the means whereby this cooperation between Pittsburgh and the countries of the South could be made operative should be initiated. PROGEFIA has a very real chance of success because of the considerable interest shown by bilateral and muItilateral cooperation agencies, by professional associations such as IAALD (International Association of Agricultural Librarians and Documentalists), and also because of CTA's role in coordinating the programme. CTA is also cooperating with EIB (Ecole Internationale de Bordeaux) to organize a course on information management by documentary <b>micro-computing.</b> This will consist of two workshops held six months apart, each lasting four weeks, which will allow the participants to put their knowledge into practice in the field and to acquire the practical experience which is crucial to any approach to database management. PROGEFIA therefore offers an innovative approach which will restructure the availability of training to the real needs of those seeking it. However, its success - which must be based on synergy and combined action - will demand a great deal of energy and commitmentinternational meeting on training in agricultural information in Rome in June 1988...|$|E
