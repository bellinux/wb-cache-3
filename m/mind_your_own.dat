2500|$|The only {{newspaper}} columnist Burroughs admired was the right-wing opinion shaper for the William Randolph Hearst newspaper chain, Westbrook Pegler. Burroughs believed in frontier individualism, which he championed as “our glorious frontier heritage on <b>minding</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> business.” Burroughs came to equate liberalism with bureaucratic tyranny, viewing government authority {{as a collective}} of meddlesome forces legislating the curtailment of personal freedom. According to his biographer Ted Morgan, his philosophy for living one's life was to adhere to a laissez-faire path, one without encumbrances—in essence a credo shared with the capitalist business world. His abhorrence of {{the government did not}} prevent Burroughs from using its programs to his own advantage. In 1949 he enrolled in Mexico City College under the GI Bill, which paid for his tuition and books and provided him with a seventy-five-dollar-per-month stipend. He maintained, “I always say, keep your snout in the public trough.” ...|$|R
