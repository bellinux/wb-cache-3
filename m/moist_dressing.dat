40|$|Advisor: Fred Carey, PT. PhDPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this case study and {{evidence}} based literature analysis {{is to determine the}} effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) versus advanced <b>moist</b> <b>dressing</b> therapy (MDT) for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Background: With the current prevalence of diabetes reaching almost 30 million in the U. S., DFU’s have become an increasingly major public health concern. Complications from DFU’s lead to an increase in health care cost, decreased quality of life, and possible death in severe cases. The serious nature of the disease requires an effective treatment plan in order to optimally manage the healing of DFU’s. The current standard of treatment includes the use of moist dressings, however, several studies suggest NPWT may be just as beneficial, if not more beneficial for the treatment of DFU’s. Case Description: The patient for this case study is based on a thirty-two year old obese female admitted to University Medical Center (UMC) El Paso with a Wagner Grade 3 diabetic foot ulcer to the right metatarsal head, leading to osteomyelitis infection requiring amputation of the right hallux. This patient was historically non-compliant with managing her diabetes, and due to complications, had multiple admissions to UMC. This patient’s course of treatment motivated an evidenced based analysis to answer the following PICO question: “In patients with diabetic foot wounds, is negative pressure wound therapy more effective than advanced <b>moist</b> <b>dressing</b> therapy for promoting faster healing times and reducing secondary complications?” Outcomes: A review of current literature revealed several high quality studies addressing the use of NPWT in the treatment of DFU’s. The overall quality of the current evidence is sufficient to answer the PICO question. Negative pressure wound therapy is a safe and effective treatment in the management of diabetic foot ulcers, resulting in better overall outcomes for the patient. Discussion: When compared to standard moist dressings, negative pressure wound therapy was found to have a similar safety profile. NPWT however, was found to have better outcomes in regards to proportion of healed ulcers, decreased healing time, greater granulation tissue formation, and decreased secondary amputations. Had this patient been initially discharged home with NPWT, she may not have been readmitted, and therefore had improved outcomes in terms of wound healing and better quality of life. Based on the current evidence, NPWT should be considered as a primary intervention in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Further {{research is needed to determine}} optimal parameter settings for the negative pressure devices, and in order to develop a standardized protocol for the use of NPWT...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comThe aim of this systematic review {{was to determine the}} best available evidence related to the post-harvest management of split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor sites. Studies included in the review were those involving patients of any age examining interventions relating to the post-harvest management of STSG donors and were intra-individual or randomized controlled trials. All studies were checked for methodological quality, and data were extracted using a data extraction tool. Many studies were combined in meta-analysis. The present report concerns studies examining moist and non-moist wound-healing dressings. Broad comparisons of moist wound-healing dressings against traditional non-moist dressings favoured moist wound-healing approaches in terms of healing rates, pain and infection. In comparing dressings within and between <b>moist</b> wound-healing <b>dressing</b> groups, the lack of studies of sufficient quality prevented determining a ‘best dressing’ for STSG donors. Moist wound-healing products have distinct clinical advantages over non-moist products in the management of STSG donors.

40|$|Background: There is a {{wide array}} of {{articles}} in medical literature for and against the laser effect on wound healing but without discrete effect determination or conclusion. This experimental study aims to evaluate the efficacy of low-level laser therapy on wound healing. Materials and Methods: Thirty-four rabbits were randomly enrolled in two groups after creating a full thickness of 3 × 3 cm wound. The intervention group received low density laser exposure (4 J/cm 2) on days 0, 3 and 6 with diode helium-neon low-intensity laser device (wl = 808 nm) and in control group <b>moist</b> wound <b>dressing</b> applied. Finally, wound-healing process was evaluated by both gross and pathological assessment. Results: Fibrin formation was the same in the two groups (P = 0. 4) but epithelialisation was much more in laser group (P = 0. 02). Wound inflammation of the laser group was smaller than that of the control groups but statistical significance was not shown (P = 0. 09). Although more smooth muscle actin was found in the wounds of the laser group but it was not statistically significant (P = 0. 3). Wound diameter showed significant decrease in wound area in laser group (P = 0. 003). Conclusion: According to our study, it seems that low-level laser therapy accelerates wound healing at least in some phases of healing process.

40|$|This bachelors? {{thesis is}} {{investigating}} problems with treatment of chronic wounds from perspective of nurses in home care agencies. First {{half of this}} theory is dedicated to wounds. Here you can find categories of wounds. This work is mainly dedicated to the investigation of chronic wounds, the exact division of most common chronic wounds and their stage placement in accordance with classification. Very important is also prevention of development of these chronic wounds. Here the most important intervention is the observation of high-risk factors. Furthermore, we described the different stages of the healing of the wound, their differentiation and progression. During treatment {{it is necessary to}} document the progress of the wound. A whole chapter is dedicated to this, so we can clearly understand what knowledge about the wound is important and which way to correctly document the wound. Continuity of healing of the wound determines the course of treatment in accordance with the colour of the base of the wound. The course of healing should go from black colour to pink, indicating a positive course of treatment. The factors influencing the treatment are separated into two categories ? internal and external. The main component of this chapter is about the treatment of chronic wounds and contemporary dressing techniques. The second part of this theory is dedicated to the characteristics of home care agencies. It is interesting to note the history of home care and the circumstance in which the idea of caring for the patient in their home environment begun. At present, a multidisciplinary team plays major role in the home care of a client. The home care provides all aspects of the care for the client and also meets all the requirements of the attending physician. This bachelor?s thesis has two goals: goal no. 1 ? to map the education of the nurses in home care in the area of healing of the wounds. Goal no. 2 ? to find the most common methods of treatment of chronic wounds for home care agencies. To reach the goal, quality research was chosen with the help of informative interviews. The first subjects of research were nurses working in regional charity Ceske Budejovice and APD Alice in Ceske Budejovice. The second research subjects were nurses in Regional charity in Znojmo. There were 8 interviews in total conducted with the nurses in home care agencies. Research question one investigates which courses home care agency nurses attend. Based on the research that was carried out I found that nurses attend courses of their choice on average three times a year. Every year they attend a course dedicated to chronic wounds treatment and they know where to seek those courses from. I also discovered the important fact that all employers found those programmes. The research question two investigates which methods of treatment are most commonly used in chronic wound treatment. On the bases of the investigation I found that the nurses prefer the use of contemporary materials, which brings great deal of benefits not only for the client but also for the nursing staff. The most commonly mentioned advantages are ? less frequent change of dressings, faster healing of the wounds, gentler change of the dressing and most importantly satisfied patient. Furthermore, I discovered a problem in using contemporary <b>moist</b> <b>dressing</b> materials. The nurses often found that the attending physician does not agree with this course of treatment and refuses to prescribe these materials. That is why most patients have to fund these themselves. Overall the nurses agreed that the treatment of chronic wounds with contemporary dressings brings the client benefits. The given goals of this bachelor?s thesis were accomplished. The nurses in home care agencies are regularly educating in the area of treatment of the wounds. The most common method in treating chronic wounds in home care agencies is moist bandage method...|$|E
40|$|Role of {{negative}} pressure <b>dressing</b> and <b>moist</b> wound healing are well {{established in the}} treatment of both acute and chronic wounds with certain advantages and disadvantages in both the techniques. Both these techniques prevents wound colonization, but the negative pressure dressing method has proved to have a greater potency to remove secretions, prevent wound invasion and eradication established infection. In both these techniques there is no accessibility to wound environment. Limited access dressing (LAD) is a <b>moist</b> wound <b>dressing</b> with negative pressure. It provides limited access to the wound through two small ports for both dressers and pathogens. The LAD design has notable advantages like wound isolation that reduces chance of wound colonization and safe disposal of infected materials (important factor to reduce hospital-acquired infections), while avoiding some major disadvantages such as opacity of dressing materials, inaccessible offensive smelling wound environment, and relatively high treatment costs. In LAD a definite intermittent negative pressure regimen is followed. The intermittent negative pressure (cycle of 30 minutes suction and 3 1 / 2 hours rest) is effective. Overall, the LAD is a safe and effective alternative to conventional dressing methods. LAD is an excellent research tool for wound healing as frequent/continuous record of wound healing is possible without disturbing the wound healing process. LAD is an effective dressing for limb salvage in cases of acute and chronic complex wounds. Leech effect prevents wound related systematic response syndrome and sepsis. Suction-assisted dressing (SAD) is a combination of semiocclusive dressing with negative pressure. It works by removal of fluids by intermittent (like LAD) negative pressure and preventing bacterial invasion. SAD is especially advantageous where soakage is less, there is no dead tissue covering the wound (e. g., following skin grafting), superficial skin wounds (e. g., donor area) and also where LAD is technically difficult to apply over circumferential trunk and neck dressings under anesthesia...|$|R
40|$|Burn {{injuries}} {{remain a}} significant cause of {{morbidity and mortality}} during modern military conflicts and peacekeeping operations. Considering that commercially available dressings are not designed {{to meet the challenges of}} treating combat burn wounds, DRDC Toronto has designed a novel, absorbent and medicated bi-layer wound dressing to address key requirements for treating external war wounds. In the present report, we assessed our dressing’s bactericidal efficacy, wound healing properties, and skin-cooling characteristics using various pre-clinical models. Biopsies taken from full-thickness, pig wounds infected with Ps. aeruginosa and Staph. epidermidis showed a 2 - to 5 -log reduction in the bacterial load of antiseptic-treated wounds compared to those of control wounds. Though increasing the frequency of dressing changes led to a greater reduction in the wound bacterial load, the contamination levels of all antiseptic-treated wounds remained below 105 CFU/g of wound. Our results also show that 97 % of partial-thickness, non-contaminated porcine wounds treated with the DRDC dressing healed within 7 days. In contrast, 92 % of the wounds treated with commercial dressings healed within 9 days. Finally, the application of a <b>moist</b> DRDC <b>dressing</b> (to simulate a condition of exudate absorption; DRDCmoist) on a scald burn covering 25 % of the dorsal area in rats reduced skin temperature (Tskin) by 1. 7 oC for 5 min, Tskin in DRDCmoist being comparable to that of control burned rats (BURN) after 25 min. While there were no significant differences between the body temperature (Tip) in BURN and DRDCmoist throughout the 90 -min experiment, application of a commercial hydrogel dressing markedly decreased Tip after 90 min (3. 03 ± 0. 55 oC). These data show that the DRDC dressing is effective in: a) delivering medications, such as an antimicrobial agent, to the wound bed; b) promoting faster healing of the treated wound; and c) providing a transient, but beneficial cooling effect to the skin contact-site, without the adverse effect of inducing whole-body hypothermia. 1. ...|$|R

Results: ECM-treated wounds closed, on average, after 5. 4 weeks of treatment, compared with 8. 3 weeks for SC wounds (P= 0. 02). Furthermore, complete wound closure was significantly higher in patients treated with ECM (P< 0. 05), with 20 wounds closed in the ECM group (80 %) and 15 wounds closed in the SC group (65 %). After 8 months, patients treated with ECM had substantially higher closed-wound weeks compared with SC (26. 0 weeks versus 22. 0 weeks, respectively). Expected direct costs per patient were $ 2, 527 for ECM and $ 2, 540 for SC (a cost savings of $ 13).
