The short length of a longitudinally <b>mounted</b> <b>flat</b> engine with six cylinders or fewer makes it ideally suitable for air cooling.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the convective heat transfer, due to the action of the wind, from the upper surface of roof <b>mounted</b> <b>flat</b> plate solar collectors. The ability to predict the quantity of heat transferred from a collector, in this manner, is necessary in order to facilitate the evaluation of the overall efficiency of a collector panel. Previous methods of determining this convection coefficient have generally relied upon extrapolations of small scale wind tunnel results to full-scale values. The validity of these methods is questionable, and it was found that {{there was a lack of}} full-scale data relating to the convection coefficient from the upper surface of a flat-plate collector. It was also found that no systematic attempt to relate model results to full scale values had been made. Full-scale experiments have been performed to evaluate the convective heat transfer coefficient, h, from the upper surface of a roof <b>mounted</b> <b>flat</b> plate. The convection coefficient was found to be dependent upon the wind speed as measured above the roof ridge line, V 6 R, and to some extent upon the direction of the prevailing wind, G. Relationships between h and V 6 R are presented, as are relationships between h and VH (the wind speed measured at the mid-panel height) and h and V 10 (the meteorological 10 m wind speed). Small scale wind tunnel experiments were also performed. This was in order to assess the potential of using wind tunnel model results to predict accurately full-scale convective heat losses. These experiments showed some qualitative agreement with the full-scale tests. However, extrapolation of these model results to full-scale values rendered heat transfer coefficients in excess of those found in the full-scale work. Therefore the use of previously derived full-scale results from wind tunnel studies must be treated with caution. It is suggested that the full-scale results, presented here, represent a more satisfactory means of evaluating the convective heat transfer from the upper surface of roof <b>mounted</b> <b>flat</b> plate solar collectors...|$|R

The small size and flat shape of the motor, and its lack of a transmission connected to the bogies, allows the ART to be much closer to the ground than a traditional subway car.

It works on same principle as HSAT, keeping the axis of tube horizontal in north-south line and rotates the solar modules east to west throughout the day. These trackers are usually suitable in high latitude locations but does not take as much land space as consumed by Vertical single axis tracker (VSAT). Therefore, it brings the advantages of VSAT in a horizontal tracker and minimizes the overall cost of solar project.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} type of mirror mount is the {{kinematic}} mount. This type of mount is designed according to the principles of kinematic determinacy. Typically, the movable frame that holds the mirror pivots on a ball bearing which is set into a hole in the fixed frame. Ideally this hole should be trihedral (pyramid-shaped). Often a conical hole is used due to easier manufacture. The frame is pivoted by means of two micrometers or fine-thread screws, tipped with steel ball bearings. One of these ball bearings rests in a V-groove, the other rests on a flat surface. On cheaper <b>mounts,</b> the <b>flat</b> surface may be simply the material of the mount. In more expensive <b>mounts,</b> the <b>flat</b> surface (and perhaps the hole and v-groove too) may be made out of a much harder material (often sapphire), set into the frame.|$|R
