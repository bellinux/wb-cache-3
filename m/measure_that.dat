5|$|Besides the budget, another <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> {{failed to}} pass in the 2002 session was a bill to {{eliminate}} {{the death penalty for}} juveniles. The precedent for the juvenile death penalty had been set in the 1989 Supreme Court case of Stanford v. Kentucky, wherein the court ruled that Kevin Stanford could be executed for the 1981 rape, sodomy, and murder of a gas station attendant in Jefferson County, Kentucky, even though Stanford was only 17 {{at the time of the}} crime. In 2003, Patton announced he would commute Stanford's sentence. Patton did oversee the execution of two adult prisoners in 1997 and 1999, making him the first Kentucky governor to do so since 1962.|$|E

5|$|Cranston {{was given}} the harshest penalty of all five senators. In November 1991, the Senate Ethics Committee voted {{unanimously}} to reprimand Cranston, instead of the more severe <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> was under consideration: censure by the full Senate. Extenuating circumstances that helped to save Cranston from censure included {{the fact that he}} was suffering from cancer, and that he had decided to not seek reelection, according to Heflin. The Ethics Committee took the unusual step of delivering its reprimand to Cranston during a formal session of the full Senate, with almost all 100 Senators present.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{oversaw the}} {{transition}} of the University of Louisville from municipal to state funding. He pushed for reforms to the state's education system, giving up his own chairmanship of the University of Kentucky board of trustees and extending voting rights to student and faculty members of university boards. These changes generally shifted administration positions in the state's colleges from political rewards to professional appointments. He increased funding to the state's education budget and gave expanded powers to the Council on Higher Education. He vetoed a <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> would have allowed collective bargaining for teachers.|$|E
5|$|Historian Lowell H. Harrison called Stanley's {{administration}} {{the apex}} of the Progressive Era in Kentucky. The most significant legislation passed during the 1916 legislative session were a state antitrust law and a ban on railroads offering free passes to public figures. A Corrupt Practices Act required candidates for office to file reports of their expenses, limited the amount of allowable expenses, and forbade public service corporations from contributing to any campaign. Other accomplishments included initiating the state's first budget program, enacting its first workman's compensation law, and instituting a convict labor law. The one progressive <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> did not pass, a bill granting women's suffrage, failed in the House by a single vote.|$|E

The bill passed that same year, despite strong opposition from Maryland's police agencies. Maryland was the first state to adopt such legislation; Utah became the second when it passed a similar bill in March 2014.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, NY93 was realigned to use Junction and Upper Mountain Roads instead. As a result, NY270 was {{cut back to}} its {{junction}} with Upper Mountain Road. On November1, 2005, the Niagara County Legislature voted on a <b>measure</b> <b>that,</b> if passed, would allow the county to ask the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to remove the NY93 designation from Upper Mountain Road, a county-maintained highway, and reassign it to Junction Road (NY270) and Saunders Settlement Road (NY31). The change was intended to eliminate truck traffic on Upper Mountain Road while providing additional capacity to NY93. This part of the agenda was passed. NYSDOT obliged to the request in 2006, rerouting NY93 as proposed and truncating NY270 southward to NY31.|$|E
5|$|Odell Waller (1917 – July 2, 1942) was an African American {{sharecropper}} from Gretna, Virginia {{executed for}} the fatal shooting {{of his white}} landlord, Oscar Wheldon Davis, on July 15, 1940. Waller unsuccessfully maintained at his trial that the killing had been in self-defense, but was convicted of a jury of white citizens who had paid the poll tax, a <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> effectively barred blacks and poor whites from jury service.|$|E

President Lincoln signed the amendment into law on July 17. Wilson's law paid African Americans in the military $10 monthly, which was effectively $7 a month after deductions for food and clothing, while white soldiers were paid effectively $14 monthly.|$|E
5|$|The Committee on Territories again {{rejected}} Weaver's bill, but {{approved a}} compromise <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> opened the Unassigned Lands, Cherokee Outlet, and Neutral Strip to settlement. Congress debated the bill over several months, while the tribes announced their resistance to their lands becoming a territory; {{according to an}} 1884 Supreme Court decision, Elkv. Wilkins, Native Americans were not citizens, and thus would have no voting rights in the new territory. When Weaver returned to Iowa to campaign for re-election, the bill was still in limbo. Running again on a Democratic–Greenback fusion ticket, Weaver was re-elected to the House in 1886 with a 618-vote majority.|$|E

5|$|In August 1816 Jennings {{was elected}} {{to serve as the}} first {{governor}} of Indiana at age 32, and re-elected for an additional term. He pressed for the construction of roads and schools, and negotiated the Treaty of St. Mary's to open up central Indiana to American settlement. His opponents attacked his participation in the treaty negotiations as unconstitutional and brought impeachment proceedings against him, a <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> was narrowly defeated by a vote of 15 to 13 after a month-long investigation and the resignation of the lieutenant governor. During his second term and following the panic of 1819, Jennings encountered financial problems, a situation exacerbated by his inability to keep up with his business interests and run the state government simultaneously. Ineligible for another term as Indiana governor under the state constitution, Jennings looked for other means of financial support. Shortly before completion of his second term as governor in 1822, Jennings {{was elected to}} the U.S. House of Representatives, before retiring from public service in 1831. In Congress Jennings promoted federal spending on internal improvements.|$|E
5|$|In January 1800, {{recognising}} that Valletta was {{in danger}} of surrendering if it could not be resupplied, the French Navy prepared a convoy at Toulon, consisting of Généreux, under Captain Cyprien Renaudin, the 20-gun corvettes Badine, Fauvette and 16-gun Sans Pareille and two or three transport ships. The force was under the command of Contre-amiral Jean-Baptiste Perrée, recently exchanged under parole after being captured off Acre the previous year, and was instructed to approach Valletta along the Maltese coast from the southwest with the intention of passing between the blockade squadron and the shore and entering Malta before the British could discover and intercept them. The convoy sailed on 7 February. In addition to the supplies, the convoy carried nearly 3,000 French soldiers to reinforce the garrison, an unnecessary <b>measure</b> <b>that</b> would completely counteract the replenishment of the garrison's food stocks.|$|E
