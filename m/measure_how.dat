These literal islands of habitat are called kīpukas, a Hawaiian name used for older land surrounded by younger lava.

5|$|In bioinformatics, microarrays {{are used}} to <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> {{strongly}} different genes are expressed {{in a sample of}} biological material. Different rates of expression of a gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression rates is defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , a halved expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate can be described by a log ratio of zero, for instance.|$|E
5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since {{no one has a}} perfect way to <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two {{kinds of}} {{integrity}} measures—contamination and suppression—are introduced. Contamination <b>measures</b> <b>how</b> much untrusted information reaches trusted outputs; {{it is the}} dual of information-flow confidentiality. Suppression <b>measures</b> <b>how</b> much information is lost from outputs; {{it does not have}} a confidentiality dual. Two forms of suppression are considered: programs and channels. Program suppression <b>measures</b> <b>how</b> much information about the correct output of a program is lost because of attacker influence and implementation errors. Channel suppression <b>measures</b> <b>how</b> much information about inputs to a noisy channel is missing from channel outputs. The relationship between quantitative integrity, confidentiality, and database privacy is examined...|$|R
5000|$|The {{soundness}} of Dembski's concept of specified complexity and {{the validity of}} arguments based on this concept are widely disputed. A frequent criticism (see Elsberry and Shallit) is that Dembski has used the terms [...] "complexity", [...] "information" [...] and [...] "improbability" [...] interchangeably. These numbers measure properties of things of different types: Complexity <b>measures</b> <b>how</b> {{hard it is to}} describe an object (such as a bitstring), information <b>measures</b> <b>how</b> close to uniform a random probability distribution is and improbability <b>measures</b> <b>how</b> unlikely an event is given a probability distribution.|$|R

5|$|Tests {{exist to}} <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> much {{sensation}} {{a person has}} retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap can be added to a vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E

40|$|Artificial {{states are}} those in which {{political}} borders do not coincide with a division of nationalities desired by {{the people on the}} ground. We propose and compute for all countries in the world two new <b>measures</b> <b>how</b> artificial states are. One is based on <b>measuring</b> <b>how</b> borders split ethnic groups into two separate adjacent countries. The other one <b>measures</b> <b>how</b> straight land borders are, under the assumption the straight land borders {{are more likely to be}} artificial. We then show that these two measures seem to be highly correlated with several measures of political and economic success. ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{kinds of}} {{integrity}} measures—contamination and suppression—are introduced. Contamination <b>measures</b> <b>how</b> much untrusted information reaches trusted outputs; {{it is the}} dual of information-flow confidentiality. Suppression <b>measures</b> <b>how</b> much in-formation is lost from outputs; {{it does not have}} a confidentiality dual. Two forms of suppression are considered: programs and channels. Program suppression mea-sures how much information about the correct output of a program is lost because of attacker influence and implementation errors. Channel suppression <b>measures</b> <b>how</b> much information about inputs to a noisy channel is missing from channel outputs.

25|$|Implicit {{measures}} of self-esteem {{began to be}} used in the 1980s. These rely on indirect {{measures of}} cognitive processing thought to be linked to implicit self-esteem, including the Name Letter Task. Such indirect measures are designed to reduce awareness of the process of assessment. When used to assess implicit self-esteem, psychologists feature self-relevant stimuli to the participant and then <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> quickly a person identifies positive or negative stimuli. For example, if a woman was given the self-relevant stimuli of female and mother, psychologists would <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> quickly she identified the negative word, evil, or the positive word, kind.|$|E

25|$|While the {{standard}} deviation does <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> far typical values tend {{to be from the}} mean, other measures are available.

25|$|Reliability {{refers to}} whether the scores are reproducible. Not all of the {{different}} types of reliability apply to the way that the CAGE is typically used. Internal consistency (whether all of the items measure the same construct) is not usually reported in studies of the CAGE; nor is inter-rater reliability (which would <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> similar peoples' responses were if the interviews were repeated again, or different raters listened to the same interview).|$|E
25|$|Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) {{and similar}} methods take {{advantage}} of this kind of logic but uses more sophisticated statistics, because component genes in real processes display more complex behavior than simply moving up or down as a group, and the amount the genes move up and down is meaningful, not just the direction. In any case, these statistics <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> different the behavior of some small set of genes is compared to genes not in that small set.|$|E
25|$|Nature {{connectedness}} {{is related}} to subjective well-being and other indicators of positive functioning such as solving a problem in one's life. Subjective well-being is defined as feeling pleasant emotions or having pleasant experiences. To assess well-being, participants complete measures of how often they feel positive emotions (an affective <b>measure),</b> <b>how</b> often they feel negative emotions (an affective measure), and how satisfied they are with their lives (a cognitive measure). Individuals {{with higher levels of}} well-being typically indicate that they are satisfied with their lives, feel more positive emotions, and less negative emotions.|$|E

25|$|In the past, {{there was}} a gorilla that used a stick to <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> deep water was. In 2009, {{there was a}} western lowland gorilla at Buffalo zoo that used a bucket to collect water. Most notably, an {{experiment}} was conducted at Buffalo Zoological Gardens from 17 April 2010 to 26 June 2010 relating to this incident. The experiment involved one adult male gorilla and three adult female gorillas given five gallon buckets near a standing pool. Two of the younger female gorillas were able to successfully fill the buckets with water. This is the first record of gorillas spontaneously using tools to drink in zoos. What should be worth noting is that {{the environment of the}} zoo may affect the behavior of the gorillas.|$|E
25|$|In {{differential}} geometry, the {{two principal}} curvatures {{at a given}} point of a surface are the eigenvalues of the shape operator at the point. They <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> the surface bends by different amounts in different directions at that point. We represent the surface by the implicit function theorem as the graph of a function, f, of two variables, {{in such a way}} that the point p is a critical point, i.e., the gradient of f vanishes (this can always be attained by a suitable rigid motion). Then the Gaussian curvature of the surface at p is the determinant of the Hessian matrix of f (being the product of the eigenvalues of the Hessian). (Recall that the Hessian is the 2-by-2 matrix of second derivatives.) This definition allows one immediately to grasp the distinction between cup/cap versus saddle point.|$|E
25|$|The {{bystander}} {{effect was}} first {{demonstrated in the}} laboratory by John M. Darley and Bibb Latané in 1968 after they {{became interested in the}} topic following the murder of Kitty Genovese in 1964. These researchers launched a series of experiments that resulted in one of the strongest and most replicable effects in social psychology. In a typical experiment, the participant is either alone or among a group of other participants or confederates. An emergency situation is staged and researchers <b>measure</b> <b>how</b> long it takes the participants to intervene, if they intervene. These experiments have found that the presence of others inhibits helping, often by a large margin. For example, Bibb Latané and Judith Rodin (1969) staged an experiment around a woman in distress. 70 percent of the people alone called out or went to help the woman after they believed she had fallen and was hurt, but when there were other people in the room only 40 percent offered help.|$|E
