5|$|Delichon is an Old World genus {{with all}} three species {{breeding}} only in the Northern Hemisphere. The common house <b>martin</b> <b>is</b> a widespread migrant breeder across Europe, north Africa and all northern temperate Asia to Kamchatka. Its western subspecies D.u.urbicum winters in tropical Africa, and eastern D.u.lagopodum moves to southern China and Southeast Asia. The Asian house martin breeds further south than common house martin {{in the mountains of}} central and eastern Asia; its nominate subspecies winters in Southeast Asia, but the races breeding in the Himalayan and Taiwan may just move from the high mountains to lower altitudes. The Nepal house <b>martin</b> <b>is</b> resident in the mountains of southern Asia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Martin</b> <b>is</b> {{cured of}} his disease and brought home; as he recovers, he grows jealous of David. He makes David go to Monica {{in the night}} and cut off a lock of her hair. This upsets the parents, {{particularly}} Henry, who fears the scissors are a weapon.|$|E
5|$|<b>Martin</b> <b>is</b> {{the owner}} and {{operator}} of Kevin's Rocks-n-Racquets, a curling supply shop located at the Saville Sports Centre. He has owned his own business since 1991. Prior to that, he was an ice maker.|$|E

50|$|St. <b>Martin</b> <b>was</b> {{laid out}} in 1866, and named after Martin of Tours. St. <b>Martin</b> <b>was</b> {{incorporated}} in 1891.|$|R

5|$|Ruth <b>Martin</b> <b>is</b> {{a fictional}} {{character}} on the long-running television series Lassie (1954–1973). She was briefly played by Cloris Leachman before June Lockhart {{stepped into the}} role. The character makes her first appearance mid-fourth season (1957) and her last in the first episode of the eleventh season (1964); she appears in 208 episodes in total.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{range of the}} Mascarene <b>martin</b> <b>is</b> restricted to three islands. Madagascar has an area of , but the next largest island, Réunion, is just 2,512km2 (790km2). Although this bird has a limited range, it is abundant on Mauritius and Réunion, and locally common in Madagascar. The population is unknown, but exceeds the vulnerability threshold of 10,000 mature individuals and {{is believed to be}} stable. This <b>martin</b> <b>is</b> therefore also classed as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|The pale crag <b>martin</b> <b>is</b> much drabber {{than most}} African swallows, and {{confusion}} is unlikely except with other crag martins or with sand martins {{of the genus}} Riparia. It is 15% smaller, paler and greyer than the Eurasian crag martin, and has smaller tail spots. It is smaller, paler, and has a more contrasting throat than the rock martin. In the far east of its range, the pale crag martin always has lighter underparts than the dusky crag martin. Although only slightly larger than the sand martin and brown-throated sand martin, the pale crag <b>martin</b> <b>is</b> more robust, has white tail spots, and lacks a breast band. Separation of similar species in flight may be complicated by the difficulty of judging colours accurately in strong desert light, particularly with juveniles. The fast flight of the brown-throated sand martin also makes identification more difficult.|$|E

5|$|The smaller {{islands of}} Saint Martin, Saba and Sint Eustatius largely {{share in the}} same folk instruments, dances and songs as their neighbors; however, these islands remain largely unstudied. Saba {{is home to a}} vital percussive music tradition, most closely {{associated}} with private parties, using instrumentation similar to Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba. Saint <b>Martin</b> <b>is</b> home to a national dance form called the ponum, which dates to the 19th century and was only displaced by string bands in the mid-20th century. Saint <b>Martin</b> <b>is</b> also home to a calypso-like quimbe song form, that remains {{a major part of the}} island's culture.|$|E
5|$|The total {{population}} of the dusky crag martin has not been quantified, but it is suspected to be increasing owing to the availability of artificial nest sites. This <b>martin</b> <b>is</b> locally common in India, Thailand, and southern China, and {{there appear to be}} range extensions to the northeast into Guangxi, southwards into lowland Laos, and westwards to the hills and plains of Sindh. There is also a recent unconfirmed report from Cambodia. Its large range and presumed high numbers mean that the dusky crag <b>martin</b> <b>is</b> not considered to be threatened, and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|At a pool party, one of Martin's friends pokes David with a knife, {{activating}} his self-protection programming. David grabs Martin {{and they}} {{fall into the}} pool. <b>Martin</b> <b>is</b> saved from drowning, but Henry persuades Monica to return David to his creator for destruction. However, Monica instead abandons both David and Teddy in the forest to hide as an unregistered Mecha.|$|E

5|$|The Mascarene {{martin has}} a heavy flight with slow wingbeats {{interspersed}} with glides, and may repeatedly {{return to a}} favourite perch. This <b>martin</b> <b>is</b> often seen perched on wires, and sometimes rests on sandy beaches. The martin roosts in small flocks in bushes, on buildings or on cliffs. Sometimes it is joined at the roost by other birds, such as blue-cheeked bee-eaters in the Seychelles.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene <b>martin</b> <b>is</b> a {{relatively}} quiet bird, {{but it has}} a warbled siri-liri siri-liri song given in flight or when perched; some calls given by perched birds end in a glissando. Other vocalisations may be used during mating or displays of aggression. There is a chip contact call, and the young birds produce a fast twittering sound when begging for food. Birds wintering in mainland Africa are usually silent.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene martin's {{breeding}} range {{is restricted to}} Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands. The nominate subspecies breeds on Mauritius and Réunion and P.b.madagascariensis occurs in Madagascar. It may also nest on Pemba Island {{where it has been}} seen in the breeding season. Breeding habitat can be anywhere with suitable sites for constructing a nest, such as ledges, buildings, tunnels, caves or amongst rocks. The <b>martin</b> <b>is</b> found {{on the east side of}} Réunion between , and on the south and west coasts of Mauritius. It also occurs on inland cliffs on Mauritius.|$|E

5|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies of the dusky {{crag martin}} breeds {{in much of}} the Indian subcontinent {{from the base of the}} Himalayas south to the Nilgiri mountains and east to West Bengal, and P. c. sintaungensis is found in southwestern China, and the northern parts of Thailand, Vietnam and Laos. The dusky crag <b>martin</b> <b>is</b> largely resident apart from local movements after breeding, but it has bred in Malaysia at least once, and occurred as a vagrant to Sri Lanka and probably Borneo.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} {{has a very}} large range of 5.9millionkm2 (2.29millionsqmi). The total {{population}} is unknown, but the bird is described as very common in Jordan and common in Egypt. It has an expanding range and increasing population. Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the pale crag <b>martin</b> <b>is</b> {{not considered to be}} threatened, and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The pale crag <b>martin</b> <b>is</b> {{caught in}} flight by several fast, agile falcon species, such as hobbies, and it {{sometimes}} carries parasites, but it faces no major threats. Because of its range of nearly 6millionkm2 (2.3millionsqmi) {{and a large}} and apparently increasing population, it is not seen as vulnerable and is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
