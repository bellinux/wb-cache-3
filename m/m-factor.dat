Evidence for this structure was obtained by amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry of the native <b>M-factor.</b> Two genes encoding the <b>M-factor</b> were also identified and characterized.

40|$|Mating {{pheromone}} signaling {{is essential}} for conjugation between haploid cells of P-type (P-cells) and haploid cells of M-type (M-cells) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. A peptide pheromone, <b>M-factor,</b> produced by M-cells is recognized by the receptor of P-cells. An M-factor-less mutant, in which the M-factor-encoding genes are deleted, is completely sterile. In liquid culture, sexual agglutination was not observed in the mutant, {{but it could be}} recovered by adding exogenous synthetic <b>M-factor,</b> which stimulated expression of the P-type-specific cell adhesion protein, Map 4. Exogenous <b>M-factor,</b> however, failed to recover the cell fusion defect in the M-factor-less mutant. When M-factor-less cells were added to a mixture of wild-type P- and M-cells, marked cell aggregates were formed. Notably, M-factor-less mutant cells were also incorporated in these aggregates. In this mixed culture, P-cells conjugated preferentially with M-cells secreting <b>M-factor,</b> and rarely with M-factor-less M-cells. The kinetics of mating parameters in liquid culture revealed that polarized growth commenced from the contact region of opposite mating-type cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that <b>M-factor</b> at a low concentration induces adhesin expression, leading to initial cell-cell adhesion in a type of "distal pheromone action", but <b>M-factor</b> that is secreted directly in the proximity of the adhered P-cells may be necessary for cell fusion in a type of "proximal pheromone action"...|$|E
40|$|A {{defect in}} the map 3 gene of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe causes h+ mating-type-specific sterility. This gene was cloned by complementation. Nucleotide {{sequence}} analysis showed {{that it has a}} coding capacity of 365 amino acids. The deduced map 3 gene product is a putative seven-transmembrane protein and has 20. 0 % amino acid identity with the a-factor receptor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encoded by STE 3. It is also homologous with the Ustilago maydis mating pheromone receptors. The map 3 gene is expressed in h+ cells but not in h- cells, and the transcripts are induced in response to nitrogen starvation. h+ cells defective in map 3 do not respond to purified <b>M-factor.</b> When map 3 is expressed ectopically in h- cells, they apparently acquire the ability to respond to the <b>M-factor</b> produced by themselves. The gpa 1 gene, which encodes the alpha-subunit of a G-protein presumed to couple with the mating pheromone receptors, is essential for this function of map 3. These observations strongly suggest that map 3 encodes the <b>M-factor</b> receptor.

These systems include minimal α-restricted binary resolution, minimal α-restricted M-clash resolution and maximal pseudo-clash resolution. Certain refinements of hyper-resolution systems with equality axioms are shown to be complete and equivalent to refinements of the pararmodulation method for dealing with equality. The completeness and efficiency of search strategies for theorem-proving problems is studied in sufficient generality to include the case of search strategies for path-search problems in graphs. The notion of theorem-proving problem is defined abstractly {{so as to be}} dual to that of and" or tree.

For efficiency, a proof procedure (T,E) requires an efficient search strategy E as well as an inference system T which admits both simple proofs and relatively few redundant and irrelevant derivations. The theory of efficient proof procedures outlined here is applied to proving the increased efficiency of the usual method for deleting tautologies and subsumed clauses. Counter-examples are exhibited for both the completeness and efficiency of alternative methods for deleting subsumed clauses. The efficiency of resolution procedures is improved by replacing the single operation of resolving a clash by the two operations of generating factors of clauses and of resolving a clash of factors.

This investigation employs 3 -D nonlinear finite element analyses to conduct an extensive parametric evaluation of crack front stress triaxiality for deep notch SE(B) and C(T) specimens and shallow notch SE(B) specimens, with and without side grooves. Crack front conditions are characterized in terms of J-Q trajectories and the constraint scaling model for cleavage fracture toughness proposed previously by Dodds and Anderson. An extension of the toughness scaling model suggested here combines a revised "in-plane" constraint correction with an explicit thickness correction derived from extreme value statistics. The 3 -D analyses provide "effective" thicknesses {{for use in the}} statistical correction which reflect the interaction of material flow properties and specimen aspect ratios, a/Wand W /B, on the varying levels of stress triaxiality over the crack front. The 3 -D computational results imply that a significantly less strict size/deformation limit, relative to the limits indicated by previous plane-strain computations, is needed to maintain small-scale yielding conditions at fracture by a stress-controlled, cleavage mechanism in deep notch SE(B) and C(T) specimens. Moreover, the analyses indicate that side grooves (20 %) should have essentially no net effect on measured toughness values of such specimens.

40|$|Testing {{of safety}} {{instrumented}} systems {{is vital to}} ensure {{they are able to}} perform the required safety function when the need arises. These tests are carried out at specified time intervals. The verification of the ability of the safety systems to perform as required is carried out by reliability assessment. This is the calculation of how likely it is that the safety instrumented system will function when needed. In carrying out reliability assessment, proof testing of safety systems is assumed to be perfect which is not always the case in reality. This thesis is important because it looks at how to evaluate this assumption to achieve a realistic estimate since testing is a key factor in reliability calculation. This study identifies the main causes of imperfectness which are classified with the five <b>M-factors</b> namely: Method, Machine, Manpower, Milieu and Material. Based on these, the situations where perfect test may not be realistic with examples are reviewed and documented. I have studied and compared different ways that the effects of tests can be treated. Three approaches to consider imperfectness of test were identified: the IEC 61508 approach where we consider the proportion (fraction) of dangerous undetected failures that are revealed by the proof test, the probability of detecting a dangerous undetected failure during a given proof test and the PDS method of adding a constant probability of test independent failures. The analysis carried out compared the first and second approach. Based on the analysis, the second approach was proposed to be the most suitable of the first two approaches. Furthermore, we present different reliability assessment methods for estimating the probability of failure on demand of a safety system. The methods used are: analytical formulas, multi-phase Markov, fault tree approach and Petri net. The principles of application and limitation with each of these approaches are presented in this thesis. In the course of this work, we discovered that some complicated cases and systems can only be analyzed by simulation.

Echo planar imaging (EPI) is the state-of-the-art imaging technique for most fMRI studies. Therefore, improvements of EPI might lead to increased sensitivity for {{a large amount of}} studies performed every day. A number of developments to shorten acquisition time have been recently proposed and the multiband technique, allowing the simultaneous acquisition of multiple slices yielding an equivalent reduction of measurement time, is the most promising among them. While the prospect to significantly reduce acquisition time by means of high multiband acceleration factors (M) appears tempting, signal quality parameters and the sensitivity to detect common RSNs with increasing <b>M-factor</b> have only been partially investigated up to now. In this study, we therefore acquired rs-fMRI data from 20 healthy volunteers to systematically investigate signal characteristics and sensitivity for brain network activity in datasets with increasing <b>M-factor,</b> M = 2 - 4. Combined with an inplane, sensitivity encoding (SENSE), acceleration factor, S = 2, we applied a maximal acceleration factor of 8 (S 2 ×M 4). Our results suggest that an <b>M-factor</b> of 2 (total acceleration of 4) only causes negligible SNR decrease but reveals common RSN with increased sensitivity and stability. Further <b>M-factor</b> increase produced random artifacts as revealed by signal quality measures that may affect interpretation of RSNs under common scanning conditions. Given appropriate hardware, a mb-EPI sequence with a total acceleration of 4 significantly reduces overall scanning time and clearly increases sensitivity to detect common RSNs.

Using advanced thermal performance computer software data are derived to construct a Calculator that determines a Mass Enhanced R-value. This R-value can be used to demonstrate Building Code compliance. T. J. Williamso...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{assess the impact}} of the {{on-board}} base station emissions, on terrestrial mobile station. The scenario consists of multiple interfering links (multiple aircrafts). The results showed that there is visibility of the on-board networks in terms of noise floor increase especially for GSM- 1800 MHz networks, and the output of the base station should be adjusted below 5 dBm, if we want to prevent co-channel interference. The results for UMTS- 2100 MHz or UMTS- 1800 MHz networks showed that {{there is no need for}} extra attenuation unless the aircraft base station transmits power more than 15 dBm. In order to keep the noise floor increase at 1 dB, for GSM- 1800 MHz network, the total interference received from the multiple on-board base stations should be reduced about 24. 5 dB. Finally, we found that the noise floor increase can be modelled with the Nakagami-m distribution; moreover, the <b>m-factor</b> is proportional to the increase of the aircraft base station power following an exponential relationship. © 2011 EurAAP...|$|E
40|$|In C. capitata sex {{determination}} {{is controlled by}} a Y-linked male determining factor (<b>M-factor)</b> which influences, either directly or indirectly, the state of activity of the female determining master gene Cctraep (Cctra epigenetic) at 8 - 10 hours after egg laying. We have developed a Medfly transgenic sexing strain which produces male-only progeny (95 % efficiency) by transgene-mediated RNAi against the female determiner Cctraep gene. C. capitata XX males are fully fertile and could be successfully mated with XX females thus leading {{to the production of}} female-only (XX) progeny. Starting from two polyA+ RNA preparations, extracted from XX-only and XYXX medfly embryos at 8 - 10 hours from oviposition, we have defined two de novo transcriptome sets consisting respectively of 42614 (XYXX, N 50 = 2158) and 39255 (XX, N 50 = 2047) assembled transcripts. In this talk we will outline the assembly testing pipeline, developed with a combination of different on-line and stand alone tools, and preliminary data on the in silico subtraction approach for the identification of male-biased genes/male-determining genes...|$|E
