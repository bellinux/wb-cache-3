40|$|Telecommunications are {{strategic}} for {{train control}} system operations. The European ERTMS/ETCS system for high speed trains control utilizes dedicated GSM-R mobile network(s). The costs for deployment and maintenance of GSM-R network are not sustainable for the extension of train control to low/medium traffic lines. This paper investigates {{on the possibility of}} replacing dedicated <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> <b>infrastructures</b> with the <b>radio</b> network integrating one (or more) existing PLMNs and satellite as backup. A methodology for performance assessment is presented and applied to the study of network availability and operational costs. Availability can be improved by allowing train to intelligently select the public network(s) time by time. Operational costs are dictated by the satellite component which may become essential in rural areas. Looking at the European scenario, a discussion on the extension of the Euroradio protocol to operate over multi-bearer mobile network is also presented...|$|R

A rapid deployment flanged pole is a <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> base station <b>infrastructure</b> transportable on truck, allowing fast and easy installation in restricted spaces. The antenna supporting pole, with climbing ladder up to the summit, is fixed to the main base frame and is composed of cylindrical flanged sections integrated by two or three sets of guys with a standard height of up to 30 meters. The flanged pole mobile station, installable in eight hours, does not require civil works or foundations, and is complete, including lateral ballast concrete weights and a working platform in checkered plate.|$|R

These parameters will at a later stage be specified by inputs from other working groups within the WWRF and from outside and will become the requirements for the next generation <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> systems. Additionally, measures like novel diversity techniques which enhance the efficiency of an air interface are identified and should be taken into account in the design of future <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> systems.
