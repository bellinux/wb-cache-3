This research seeks to enhance the performance of passive RF tags by developing a series of tests, or radio assay, to measure the following: the performance of RF tag antennas as a function of antenna material and manufacturing technique and the antenna performance when attached to various materials. The radio assay experiments are designed for RF tag antennas that operate in the far field of the tag reader and communicate using <b>modulated</b> <b>backscatter</b> radiation at 915 MHz.

The VHF or UHF transceivers (e. g.

To reduce overall power consumption, both the data rate and the duty cycle of the radio are usually minimized, because the lifetime of the device is limited by the energy density of available battery technologies. Recent innovations in <b>modulated</b> <b>backscatter</b> techniques offer the possibility of a radical reduction in the power cost and complexity of the data uplink, while significantly improving data rate.

30|$|A {{promising}} {{communication technology}} for WBANs is backscatter {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) in the ultra high frequency (UHF) range. Backscatter RFID relies on the radio communication between an RFID reader, acting as a control unit, and a multitude of passive or semi-passive RFID transponders (tags), acting as sensor nodes.

40|$|National {{audience}} This work {{takes place}} in the context of real time localization systems (RTLS) made as a system of RFID tags and a set of readers. Although some systems have already existed for several years, the double challenge of a low consumption for the tags (ideally fully passive, i. e. without any local source of energy) and of a high spatial resolution for the localization capability is very hard to achieve. An approach has been pursued within a few years, which consists of a system of four readers at the corners of a parallelepiped (&# 8206;Figure 1.), and of tags operating according to a <b>modulated</b> <b>backscattering</b> principle &# 8206;[1]. The benefit lies in the low energy requirement within the tag, since for responding to the interrogation signal, it only needs to modify the impedance seen by the antenna port, according to a certain digital code. This process does not require an RF transmitter in the tag, with the associated energy consumption. At the reader, the <b>modulated</b> <b>backscattered</b> signal is received and can be detected by making use of the processing gain provided by the code. An extra code can be used by the reader itself, so to discriminate between its own backscattered signals from those coming from the other readers. In other words, among the system parameters that require careful design in order to control the link budget and the effect of interference, the coding strategy is essential &# 8206;[1]. Although some local energy source remains necessary, it can be much smaller than for an active transmitter and making use of a very small battery. Technologies are currently developed in order to cope with such needs, e. g. with supercapacitors &# 8206;[2]. In this work, we address the system performance {{from the point of view}} of the radio channel between the readers and the tags. Typically, the backscattered signal is similar to that of a radar, meaning that it decays as the 4 th power with the distance, which is extremely fast. In addition, since the technology is ultra wide band, the power spectral density is severely limited (typically well below 1 mW) and is much smaller than the power limitation for UHF RFID readers (typically 2 W). These facts are highly constraining in terms of detection range. However, since not only the propagation but also the antennas are involved in the link budget, it is possible to play with antenna characteristics in order to improve it somewhat. In this paper, we concentrate on attenuation measurements between reader antennas and tags, which depend on the reader antenna characteristics and the tag antenna characteristics, including the polarization. We show that, by appropriately tuning the reader antenna characteristics, the 4 th power distance dependence can be reduced, hence providing an enhanced detection range. </p...|$|R

In AURIS, a tag-like semi-passive RFID component (referred as sensatag) can capture backscatter signal of other proximal tags with presence of RF source. According {{to the principle of}} backscatter radio link, the received signal at sensatag antenna is the superposition of backscatter signal of tags and continuous carrier wave (CW) from RF source. However, due to phase difference between tag's backscatter signal and RF CW, the <b>modulated</b> <b>backscatter</b> signal could be cancelled. We refer this effect as phase cancellation effect. Exploiting the spatial diversity of dual-antenna's two receiving paths, the likelihood of phase cancellation occurrence could be reduced. But the developed technique with two co-operating paths is not energy efficient. Therefore, this paper proposes to inject a ASK-PSK modulated stamp sequence in the pilot tone of backscatter signal as a signature of phase cancellation for ASK modulated data frame, which could be identified by the receiving sensatag. With the knowledge of occurrence of phase cancellation, sensatag could activate the alternative receiving path. This technique fully exploits the space diversity of dual-antenna, and also reduces the power consumption by reducing one receiving path in operation.

This paper argues that scalar-valued DRCS analysis is unnecessarily limiting because of the inherent coherence of the backscatter link and the complex-valued nature of load-dependent antenna-mode scattering from an RFID tag. Consider-ing <b>modulated</b> <b>backscatter</b> in terms of complex-valued scattered fields opens the possibility of quadrature modulation of the backscatter channel. When compared with binary ASK or PSK based RFID systems which transmit one bit of data per symbol period, and thus one bit per on-chip clock oscillator period, tags employing vector backscatter modulation can transmit more than one bit per symbol period. This increases the data rate for a given on-chip symbol clock rate leading to reduced on-chip power consumption and extended read range. Alternatively, tags employing an M-ary modulator can achieve log 2 M higher data throughput at essentially the same DC power consumption as a tag employing binary ASK or PSK. In contrast to the binary ASK or PSK backscatter modulation employed by passive and semi-passive UHF RFID tags, such as tags compliant with the widely used ISO 18000 - 6 c standard, this paper explores a novel CMOS-compatible method for generating M-ary QAM backscatter modulation. A new method is presented for designing an inductorlessM-ary QAM backscatter modulator using only an array of switched resistances and capacitances.

They may, probably, be deployed in inhospitable or hostile environments, {{where it may}} not be possible to refresh energy sources. Hence, energy consumption is a major issue, and energy-aware protocols / applications are desirable. Energy consumption is observed at three stages, node communication, sensing and processing. A Wireless Sensor Network is a special kind of wireless network consisting of small and spatially distributed autonomous devices (nodes) which can cooperatively sense physical phenomena around them. Each node in the sensor network may consist of one or more sensors, a low power radio, portable power supply, and possibly localization hardware. Optimizing the three processes will lead to a reduction in the energy consumed. During RF transmission energy consumed by critically energy-constrained sensor nodes in a WSN is related to the life time system, but the life time of the system is inversely proportional to the energy consumed by sensor nodes.

The sensor {{consists of an}} antenna, a rectifier, an oscillator, and a modulator. When the sensor is illuminated by a continuous wave (CW), the rectifier generates a DC supply voltage for the oscillator, which drives the modulator. As a consequence, the sensor produces a modulation to the reflected (CW). Sensing can be realized by designing the oscillator such that its frequency depends on the sensed variable. In this thesis, rectifier, oscillator, and modulator for the transponder are designed and implemented in practice. The operation of each part is analytically predicted using simplified models to anticipate the operation principle of the sensor. Through the analysis, sensor parameters such as rectified DC voltage, oscillator output voltage, power consumption by the oscillator and modulated reflected power of the sensor are predicted. As analytical equations indicate, the modulated reflected power of the sensor can be predicted {{as a function of}} input power of the sensor. It is found out that the rectified DC voltage depends on the diode parameters, input power and load impedance. Oscillator output voltage depends on the rectified DC voltage, oscillator circuit topology, and quality factor and characteristic impedance of the resonator. Moreover, power consumption by an oscillator can be made arbitrarily small by decreasing the capacitive divider ratio. Furthermore, modulated reflected power of the sensor depends on mixer diode parameters, input power of the sensor and output voltage of the oscillator. The operations of all parts are characterized by using simulation and measurement. Simulated and measured results show good agreement, which justifies the accuracy of the results.

Careful calibration and measurement allows for {{the reconstruction of the}} fiber transfer function, which, associated to its mathematical model, is capable of extracting the fiber characteristics. The technique is capable of identifying non-reflective fault events in an optical fiber link and is perfectly compatible with previous methods that focus on the reflective events. The fact that the recuperation of the complex signal is performed in the frequency domain and not via a Fourier Transform enables the measurements to overcome the spatial resolution limitation of Fourier Transform incoherent-OFDR measurements even with frequency sweep ranges down to 100 - 100000 Hz. This result is backed up by a less than 10 meters difference in fault location when compared to standard OTDR measurements.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{prototype}} device {{to measure the}} tag-antenna’s structural mode term is proposed. The device comprises a switching transistor, controlled by a microcontroller, and a reverse-biased varactor diode connected to the transistor. The antenna’s load is selectively modified by applying the appropriate DC voltage on the varactor. Antenna’s structural mode is evaluated by measuring the <b>backscattered</b> <b>modulated</b> field for three states of the varactor. In contrast to prior art: i) the proposed device can be conveniently {{used to measure the}} structural mode of any antenna, via an RF connector, without the need to successively attach different loads to the antenna under test, ii) measurements can be performed under fading/changing conditions, as fading-effects are removed, as demonstrated herein. The device can be used to evaluate backscatter communications for different tag-loading. Furthermore, it could operate as an RF sensor, where the sensor’s voltage “drives ” the varactor’s capacitance. RFID; antenna; structural-mode; backscattering I...|$|R
