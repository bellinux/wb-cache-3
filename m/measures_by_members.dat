40|$|A set {{of choice}} related {{interventions}} exist for 'nudging' individuals towards socially desirable behaviours. Conversely, regulation, which we refer as 'budging', implies {{a reduction in}} the choice-set for these individuals. We compare the voluntary adoption of water quality management techniques between farmers within a designated Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) with those outside the zone across Scotland. Divergent groups emerge towards the purpose of the regulation, responsibility towards water pollution issues and compliance towards the regulation. There were significantly higher levels of adoption of some voluntary water quality <b>measures</b> <b>by</b> <b>members</b> of the non-designated group. We argue that engagement with these farmers should not focus purely on the biophysical division under which they are designated but should include the range of attitudinal alignments should include across designations in order to change social norms. This would be an approach for raising the social capital of farmers within a community and engender long-term behavioural change. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} current WTO rules concerning telecommunications services. It {{includes an}} explanation {{of the structure of the}} GATS, its Annex on Telecommunications, and the Agreement on Basic Telecommunication Services. As discussed in the previous chapter, the latter reflects the commitments of sixty-nine countries that agreed to open their markets to foreign basic telecommunication services and to foreign suppliers of these services. It also contains additional rules which are linked to these commitments and are assembled under the so-called ‘Reference Paper’. The GATT is relevant in relation to equipment and terminals used to convey and receive telecommunications signals. This, however, constitutes a different line of trade, which is discussed in Chapter 9 of this book. he GATS, similarly to the GATT, aims at protecting equality of competitive opportunities for companies in domestic markets regardless of their origin and the origin of their services. It aims at facilitating progressive liberalisation of services while enabling WTO Members to regulate them “in order to meet national policy objectives”. The GATS thus constitutes the framework agreement relevant to all services and particularly those that, like telecommunication services, have been or are being liberalised. n contrast with the GATT, the GATS contains a mix of horizontal commitments applicable to all services and service suppliers and sectorbased commitments only applicable to those sectors which have been explicitly open to trade by WTO Members. Horizontal rules apply to all <b>measures</b> <b>by</b> <b>Members</b> affecting trade in services. There are no limits in the scope of services except those supplied on a non-commercial basis or outside any form of competition, such as national security or justice.

40|$|Residential {{wireless}} {{networks have}} grown {{rapidly in the}} past decade. Meanwhile, dense deployments and autonomous managements of home Access Points (APs) greatly increase channel congestion levels and degrade the user experience. To address such problems, this paper proposes an architecture in residential environments called Wi-Fi Union (WU), where home APs can voluntarily join WU and become "member APs". WU helps member APs decrease their congestion levels by assigning channels in a coordinated manner with incentive considerations. First, we propose congestion level metric normalized airtime which can be passively and independently <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>member</b> APs. Normalized airtime is further used to classify APs into heavily congested APs and lightly congested APs. A tabu search based channel assignment algorithm is presented which can decrease the congestion level of heavily congested member APs, and guarantee lightly congested member APs to be still lightly congested. Extensive NS- 3 simulations driven by actual Wi-Fi data show that the united channel assignments has a 1. 5 times throughput than that in the default setting on average.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} payback from {{efforts of the}} International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) to {{coordinate}} proactive counterterrorism <b>measures</b> <b>by</b> its <b>member</b> countries to arrest terrorists and weaken their ability to conduct operations. We use Interpol arrest data and data on utilization of Interpol resources <b>by</b> <b>member</b> countries to compute counterfactual benefit measurements, which, when matched with costs, yield benefit-cost ratios. The average of these ratios is approximately 200 over 12 alternative counterfactual scenarios, so each dollar of Interpol counterterrorism spending returns approximately $ 200. This paper also puts forward a perspective on benefits derived from Interpol’s Stolen and Lost Travel Document database. Interpol provides an inexpensive proactive measure against transnational terrorism that, unlike military operations, does not result in backlash attacks. ...|$|R
40|$|Psychology and {{religion}} {{would appear to}} be related in principle. But religion does not feature largely in main-stream psychology. Richards (1988) argues that the relationship has historically been closer than it is now, and Buchanan (2003) largely agrees. A prior question, it is suggested, is what we do or should mean by the two terms. Different types of definition are discussed, stipulative, reportive, essentialist and operational. A special case of the last can be considered to be ’family resemblances’, characteristics shared in unequal <b>measure</b> <b>by</b> <b>members</b> of a class. This seems most appropriate to religion, but the lists of most writers appear too short. A longer set of characteristics is suggested. But for psychology a lexical approach seems more helpful, an example being the author’s distinction between discipline, subject and profession. These points suggest two entities which do have something in common, but which are in fact essentially different in significant ways affecting assumptions, content, methodology and modes of thought. Nevertheless psychology should engage with religion. Some reasons why it has not done so more completely are discussed. There are currently signs of a more comprehensive approach...|$|R

40|$|External {{measurements}} and size {{differences between the}} sexes were examined in the coastal spotted dolphin, Stenella attenuata graffmani, in Bahia de Banderas, on the Mexican Pacific coast. The dolphins were collected by local fishermen and 29 external characteristics were <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> <b>members</b> of the Marine Mammals Laboratory, University of Mexico. The length of each characteristic with respect to total length was analysed through adjustment of the data to a power equation. A stepwise discriminant analysis {{was applied to the}} absolute values and to those expressed as proportions to analyse the differences between the sexes. Results indicate that growth in these dolphins is generally negatively allometric, and most of the characteristics measured were, in both absolute and proportional terms, greater in male dolphins than in female dolphins. As found in many species of odontocetes, the discriminant analysis showed that the main differences between the sexes for this coastal subspecies include the relative positions of the umbilicus, the genital aperture and the anus. The morphometric data provided by this study, corresponding to 29 specimens of S. a. graffmani collected in a restricted locality of the Mexican Pacific coast, are particularly interesting to studies documenting latitudinal morphological differences in the coastal spotted dolphin...|$|R

This dissertation examines how the Precautionary Principle, as an internationally recognised concept enshrined in a range of legal instruments, has been applied to provide a mechanism for protection of the environment and health in response to the introduction of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in Europe. It examines how the European Court of Justice substantively handled the risk assessment phase across three seminal cases between 2003 and 2011 in which Member States had failed in their attempt to trigger the Precautionary Principle in order to uphold a ban or suspension of the cultivation or sale of products derived from GMOs in their territory. The analysis of these judgements suggests that the Court has applied a narrow approach to the evidence provided by national governments during the risk assessment stage, and has thereby limited the potential for precautionary <b>measures</b> <b>by</b> <b>Member</b> States to be upheld by the Court. This outcome reflects a ‘weak’ application of the Precautionary Principle by the Court in contrast with the ‘strong’ interpretation implied by the European legal and policy framework and objections of Member States.
