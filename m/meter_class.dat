25|$|Since about 1995 {{measurement}} of extragalactic eclipsing binaries' fundamental parameters has become possible with 8 <b>meter</b> <b>class</b> telescopes. This makes it feasible {{to use them}} to directly measure the distances to external galaxies, a process that is more accurate than using standard candles. By 2006 they had been used to give direct distance estimates to the LMC, SMC, Andromeda Galaxy and Triangulum Galaxy. Eclipsing binaries offer a direct method to gauge the distance to galaxies to a new improved 5% level of accuracy.|$|E
