50|$|It was {{not until}} the advent of MIDI, {{introduced}} to the public in 1983, that general-purpose computers really started to play a role as software sequencers. NEC's personal computers, the PC-88 and PC-98, added support for <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencing</b> with MML programming in 1982. In 1983, Yamaha modules for the MSX featured music production capabilities, real-time FM synthesis with <b>sequencing,</b> <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencing,</b> and a graphical user interface for the software sequencer. Also in 1983, Roland Corporation's CMU-800 sound module introduced music synthesis and sequencing to the PC, Apple II, and Commodore 64.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Triton introduced many improvements {{over the}} Trinity, like 62-note polyphony, arpeggiator, onboard sampler, faster operating system and more realtime controllers. However, to much surprise of musicians and journalists, it lost the sequencer audio tracks, digital input and output, and the digital filter section was downgraded, thus limiting sample-based synthesis. The original piano samples, a crucial evaluation element of expensive synths and music workstations, were {{the subject of}} even greater criticism; arguably, the integrated sample RAM could compensate for this. With successive models, some of these shortcomings were rectified, such as the digital connectivity, and improvement of the piano samples. The sample-based synthesis filter section, however, was never improved. Some limited 2-track audio recording was added to later revisions of the Triton Studio, while the Triton Extreme added in-track sampling support, allowing stereo samples to be recorded in context with a <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequence</b> and automatic triggering of the samples at their proper locations in the sequence during playback. Whilst less robust in function and practice, in-track sampling did mitigate {{for the lack of}} full audio recording in the Triton Extreme.|$|E

[...] — Joes Williams on Motion Graphics virtual instrumentconcept According to Joe Williams, the final concept of Motion Graphics was realized rather than first planned out. His initial plan was [...] "to make a synth pop record without any nostalgia" [...] influenced by the works of Japanese technopop acts such as Yellow Magic Orchestra. In fact, Motion Graphics is similar to Yellow Magic Orchestra's music, as well as the works of Ryuichi Sakamoto or Kraftwerk, in that it is a response to modern commercial technology by [...] "turning it into pop music" [...] as Angus Finlayson described. It wasn't until Williams made [...] "Anyware" [...] while riding on a Amtrak to Grand Central Terminal that he figured out the overall concept of Motion Graphics, where he made a marimba <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequence</b> for the song that sounded like a ringtone. The more experimental songs on the album are instrumental, while cuts with vocals from Williams are more on the pop music side.|$|E

40|$|The {{basis of}} this thesis is a {{portfolio}} of eight original compositions with analyses of each individual composition. All of the compositions have been composed under the working title of ‘Nature and Music’; the compositions include solo works, works for small and large ensembles ranging from solo violin, piano, to small wind ensemble, to large orchestra. These works are {{a continuation of the}} development of compositional skill and style which I learned and developed at undergraduate level. They have all been based on various aspects of nature; water, trees, wind etc. This submission has been divided into two volumes: Volume 1 This contains the analyses of all eight compositions. Each analysis is presented under the following headings: · Introduction · Analysis · Compositional Approach · Rhythmic Techniques · Harmonic Style · Formal Structures · Instrumentation/Orchestration · Sonorities/Texture/Timbre Volume 2 This contains the scores of all of the eight compositions, presenting the analyses under the same headings as volume 1. This volume also includes the conclusion and bibliography. An accompanying CD containing MIDI tracks and recordings of the works accompanies volume 2, along with a separate DVD featuring a visual clip to accompany ‘Drips’ CD Track List Track: Title: File Type: Track 1 : Babbling Brook Recording Track 2 : Storm at Sea Recording Track 3 : Drips Recording Track 4 : Still Water Recording Track 5 : Changing of the Seasons Live Recording Track 6 : Voice of the Trees <b>MIDI</b> <b>Sequence</b> Track 7 : Incendios Forestales! <b>MIDI</b> <b>Sequence</b> Track 8 : Mechanical Wind <b>MIDI</b> <b>Sequence</b> (N.

40|$|Piano Crossing is an {{interactive}} art installation which transforms the zebra crossing into a working piano keyboard where pedestrians generate music by walking across it. Installation {{consists of the}} zeboard - zebra crossing turned keyboard - by adding black stripes to the existing white ones, serving as keys, a digital camera overlooking the zeboard and of a laptop computer with speakers. The computer runs a specially designed software, which recognizes pedestrian's contacts with the keys by using OpenCV's computer vision methods, and by that generates a <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequence,</b> which furthermore turns into music. The application consists of two main processes. 'Generate Keyboard' is about creating abstract presentation of MIDI keyboard from an input frame. The image is segmentated to individual regions belonging to the keys. Each key includes a contour of the region, a MIDI note number and a key status. The abstract keyboard presentation is then used in the 'Track and Play' process, which brings the actual execution. For the pedestrian positioning two different background substraction techniques can be used; the simple technique or the advanced codebook model technique. The installation software was tested on two different models of the Piano Crossing; on an actual zebra crossing outdoor and on the reduced-in-size model indoor. ...|$|E

40|$|Voice-to-MIDI, one of {{the input}} methods for <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequence</b> data, has a merit that users can input melodies intuitively. However, {{sometimes}} the quolity of pitch translation is not satisfactory. To solve this issue, we propose a method to correct such translation mistakes by concurrently using rhythm taps and gestures with the Voice-to-MIDI. Our method allows the users to input 3 level （high / low / hold） pitch transition information by tap gesture when they start to sing and tap. After singing and tapping, the note peers have the paradox between pitch transition by pitch translation algorithm and pitch transition by tap gesture are corrected by the pitch correction rules. We developped the prototype system and had the experiments to evaluate the pitch correction accuracy and its usability with 2 subjects. According to {{an example of the}} results, For total 4 paradoxical note peers, 1 peer was corrected propery, but others are corrected with mistakes. For our system, the subjects said it is heavy work that they should sing, tap and imagine the pitch transition concurrently. Our method shows some usable case, but we found the issues of our method and correction rules. 第五回知識創造支援システムシンポジウム, 主催：日本創造学会，北陸先端科学技術大学院大学, 共催：石川県産業創出支援機構文部科学省知的クラスター創成事業金沢地域「アウェアホームのためのアウェア技術の開発研究」, 開催：平成 20 年 2 月 21 日～ 23 日, 報告書発行：平成 20 年 3 月 14...|$|E

50|$|Click {{tracks were}} also once very {{important}} {{in the creation of}} accurately timed music such as radio/TV spots (commercials) and other timed production music. In this type of use a rhythm section or ensemble would play all instruments to a click track. With the use of <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencing</b> in the '80s and '90s it became possible to build an entire music track that was accurately timed without depending solely on a click track. Computer based <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencing</b> programs are still used in the creation of music. The MIDI sequencer generated track can be used with only MIDI controlled instruments or embellished with real instruments played by musicians. The musicians who embellish the tracks created with MIDI sequencer essentially play along with the already timed piece of music. In many cases all of the MIDI instrumentation is replaced by actual musicians.|$|R
50|$|Record emulates a {{recording}} studio, with a mixing desk, {{a rack of}} virtual instruments and effects, and an audio sequencer (similar to traditional <b>MIDI</b> <b>sequencing.)</b> It is also made to work alongside Reason; if Record is installed on a computer with Reason on it, the modules from Reason will be usable inside of Record.|$|R
