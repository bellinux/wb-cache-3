5|$|Roxas' {{personality}} changes significantly {{across the}} series {{due to the}} fact that when first introduced, he appears with fake <b>memories</b> <b>that</b> make him believe he is a common teenager, and spends most of his time with his friends. After learning that he is Sora's Nobody, and remembering his past, Roxas gives up his existence so that Sora can continue to exist, but still expresses happiness for his fate. During his time in the Organization, Roxas develops a calm personality as a result of having no memories of a previous life, unlike other Nobodies.|$|E
5|$|Syaoran is {{introduced}} in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle {{as a young}} archaeologist who often visits the Kingdom of Clow and {{is in love with}} his childhood friend Sakura, the kingdom's princess. Syaoran is the adopted son of the late archeologist , who found him as a child in the street with no memories of his past. Syaoran often accompanied his father on expeditions, and following his father's death, he lived alone while continuing his father's job. After Sakura's memories are scattered in the form of feathers throughout many dimensions, Syaoran meets Yūko Ichihara, a witch who gives him, Fai D. Flowright, and her other clientsMokona Modoki; a creature that can transport them to different dimensions. Syaoran pays Yūko for the use of Mokona with all of Sakura's <b>memories</b> <b>that</b> involved him.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2084, in a futuristic version of Paris called Neo-Paris. The Memorize {{corporation}} has invented a new brain implant called Sensen, which enables 99% of the population to upload and share their memories on the net, as well as remove unhappy or unpleasant memories. This gives Memorize an immense degree of control over the population and enables them to establish a surveillance state, which leads a small group of rebels by the name of Errorists to attempt to bring down Memorize. The invention of the Sensen has also resulted in the creation of Leapers, memory-addicted humans who have absorbed so many <b>memories</b> <b>that</b> their Sensen has degraded and they have mutated into subhuman form, now living in the sewers of Neo-Paris.|$|E
50|$|Three {{types of}} sensory {{memories}} exist. Iconic memory is a fast decaying store of visual information; {{a type of}} sensory <b>memory</b> <b>that</b> briefly stores an image which has been perceived for a small duration. Echoic memory is a fast decaying store of auditory information, another type of sensory <b>memory</b> <b>that</b> briefly stores sounds that have been perceived for short durations. Haptic memory {{is a type of}} sensory <b>memory</b> <b>that</b> represents a database for touch stimuli.|$|R
40|$|Most of our {{memories}} are inferential, so says Sven Bernecker in Memory: A Philosophical Study. I show that {{his account of}} inferentially remembering that p is too strong. A revision of the account that avoids the difficulty is proposed. Since inferential <b>memory</b> <b>that</b> p is <b>memory</b> <b>that</b> q (a proposition distinct from p) with an admixture of inference from one’s <b>memory</b> <b>that</b> q and a true thought one has that r, its analysis presupposes an adequate account of the (presumably non-inferential) <b>memory</b> <b>that</b> q. Bernecker’s account of non-inferentially remembering that is shown to be inadequate. A remedy lies in strengthening the account by requiring the rememberer to have had prima facie justification to believe that q, any defeaters of which were misleading...|$|R

5|$|Harry learns from Snape's <b>memories,</b> <b>that</b> while Snape despised Harry's late father, James, who had bullied him, {{he loved}} his late mother, Lily. Following her death, Snape worked {{secretly}} with Dumbledore to protect Harry from Voldemort because of his love for Lily. Harry also learns Dumbledore was dying and wanted Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe {{he saw in the}} woods that led him to the sword had been conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him and that Harry must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within him. Harry then surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who finds himself in limbo, where Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's own curse. Harry then returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort once and for all. He fakes being dead, and Narcissa Malfoy lies to Voldemort that Harry is dead after confirming that Draco is okay.|$|E
5|$|In {{between the}} time Scott {{released}} Alien in 1979 {{and returned to the}} franchise with Prometheus in 2012, he directed another notable science fiction film concerning artificial intelligence, Blade Runner, in 1982. Contrary to the white-blooded androids of Alien that emulate emotions and recognize a disconnect with humanity, Blade Runner features the replicants- enhanced biorobotic humanoids that may only be identified by their lacking emotions. In order to maintain control, the replicants' human creators install false <b>memories</b> <b>that</b> detail entire lives that give them a sense of identity. Blade Runner, a largely influential film, has prompted a slew of philosophical questions concerning artificial intelligence and whether or not an android could truly be considered alive. The film specifically questions whether thoughts, a sense of identity, emotions and consciousness in general, may be something genuine when applied to artificial intelligence. Due to David identifying himself as a living entity - similar to the replicants - film critics in 2012 would come not to only question if Prometheus was a direct prequel to Alien, but if the film had a relation to Blade Runner.|$|E

25|$|Memories of 'future relevance' {{are also}} {{consolidated}} greater during sleep. In {{a study by}} Wilhelm et al., 2011, memories of items that participants knew were needed for the future (for the testing session) were remembered more after sleep.

25|$|Culture {{not only}} {{influences}} {{the age at}} which the reminiscence bump appears but also the content of the memories found within the bump. Western cultures often value individuality, agency, and distinctiveness, where individuals are encouraged to develop and maintain their private beliefs, attitudes, and personality traits. Alternatively, Asian cultures often value group solidarity, communion, and interconnectedness, where individuals are encouraged to develop a sense of self that is aligned with social roles, duties, and responsibilities. The differences in societal norms expressed by Western and Asian cultures influence the focus of memories. Individuals from Western cultures have <b>memories</b> <b>that</b> cast the individual as the central character and often have self-focused autobiographical memories. Individuals from Asian cultures have <b>memories</b> <b>that</b> express a strong group orientation and often have relation-centered autobiographical memories.|$|E

25|$|These {{researchers}} presented cue-words in {{the form}} of common locations (restaurants, markets, parks), objects (chair, table, television), positive emotions (happy, joy, cheerful), negative emotions (frustration, pain, sad), and significant others (father, mother, friend). Participants were asked to retrieve a memory that reminded them of the cue- word, recall memories from across their lifespan, and recall <b>memories</b> <b>that</b> were at least a year old. Then participants were asked to date the memory to the nearest month and year. The results were graphed on a lifespan retrieval curve, and the reminiscence bump was observed.|$|E

25|$|The narrative/identity account {{suggests}} that the reminiscence bump occurs because {{a sense of identity}} develops during adolescence and early adulthood. Research {{suggests that}} <b>memories</b> <b>that</b> have more influence and significance to one's self are more frequently rehearsed in defining one's identity, and are therefore better remembered later in life (Ece & Gulgoz, 2014). Identity formation provides added motivation for using cognitive processes to ensure recall of these memories. The events from this period {{are more likely to be}} organized into a story or view of oneself, and benefits from the advantage of schematic organization in memory.|$|E
25|$|These {{memories}} {{have been}} tested in different ways, including measuring the ability to recall details of the event {{and the impact of}} additional cues on the recall of the event. Denver, Lane and Cherry found that flashbulb <b>memories</b> <b>that</b> took place in the reminiscence bump were exceptionally vivid and easily accessible. It is suggested that the flashbulb memories encoded during the reminiscence bump are so vivid because the events happened during a time of identity formation and peak brain function. Additionally, these events are recalled well because they undergo more rehearsal due to their serious nature and frequent discussion.|$|E
25|$|The biological/maturational account {{suggests}} that genetic fitness is improved by having many <b>memories</b> <b>that</b> {{fall within the}} reminiscence bump. Cognitive capacities are at their optimum from the ages of 10 to 30 and the reminiscence bump may reflect a peak in cognitive performance. This account is therefore sometimes called the cognitive abilities account. Researchers {{have suggested that the}} increase of cognitive ability in early adulthood may cause memories during this time period to be more adequately stored (Ece & Gulgoz, 2014). The reminiscence bump is caused by age-related differences in encoding efficiency, which cause more memories to be stored in adolescence and early adulthood.|$|E
