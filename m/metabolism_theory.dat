To study the physiological adaptations of an intertidal-subtidal species to the extreme and unpredictable heat stress of the intertidal zone, oxygen consumption rate and heat shock protein expression were quantified in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. Using simulate natural temperatures, the relationship between temperature, physiological performance (oxygen consumption and heat shock proteins) and thermotolerance were assessed. Depression of oxygen consumption rate and upregulation of heat shock protein genes (hsps) occurred in sequence when ambient temperature was increased from 24 to 30 °C. Large-scale mortality of the sea cucumber occurred when temperatures rose beyond 30 °C, suggesting that the upregulation of heat shock proteins and mortality are closely related to the depression of aerobic metabolism, a phenomenon that is in line with the concept of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT). The physiologically-related thermotolerance of this sea cucumber should be an adaptation to its local environment...|$|E

Modeling, guided by urban <b>metabolism</b> <b>theory,</b> demonstrated that a compact urban form, reduced water consumption by 90 GL/a, compared with a sprawling city, and had greater water conservation impact than simulated demand management measures. Household water conservation, coupled with increased use of solar hot water systems, reduced grid energy use by some 30 PJ/a. Desalination, tripled water supply energy demand, growing to a total of 4. 5 PJ/a, by 2045. While the increase is less than 1 % of total Melbourne urban energy use, it contributes to a substantial increase in the energy bill for urban water provision. Importantly, the energy impact could be offset through demand management measures. Recommendations for the combined management of water and energy include improving energy characterization of the urban water cycle; impact-evaluation of regional plans; using total urban water and energy balances in analysis to provide context; and developing reporting mechanisms and indicators to help improve baseline data across the water and energy systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} life on early Earth is {{unresolved}} still. Two approaches to the problem dominate the debate. Replicator-first proponents search {{for the very first}} replicator molecule. A much envisioned molecule in this regard is RNA. Metabolism-first adherents deem it unlikely that a replicator molecule emerged de novo on early Earth, and instead search for a network of small molecules that could have seeded modern life. Three metabolism-first scenarios are discussed. The elaborate lipid world scenario proclaims the Darwinian selection of early metabolic networks. It is shown that even though persisting entities may have come into existence, heredity in ensemble replicators is probably too inaccurate to allow for their selection, and even if accurate enough inherently attractor based, posing severe problems for their subsequent evolution. The problems are exemplary for scenarios that pose the evolution of metabolic networks. The only demonstration to date of the accumulation of novel mutations in ensemble replicators is provided in a far-off from real chemistry polymer model. The evolutionary dynamics encountered in the model depend heavily on the combinatorial chemistry of polymers, and cannot be generalised with the same success to monomer models. Moreover, many open questions remain. It is concluded that the standing of Darwinian selection in metabolism-first scenarios is problematic. The proposition that life started with the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle that arose due to geochemical ordering is discussed {{as an example of a}} preparatory <b>metabolism</b> <b>theory.</b> As yet, it has not been shown that the cycle arises spontaneously in geothermal environments. The repertoire of catalysis by small organic molecules and mineral surfaces seems to be a crucial factor. A thermodynamic framework for non-equilibrium systems is lacking.

It is concluded that the claim that metabolism-first theories provide a robust alternative for replicator-first scenarios cannot be supported yet based on the three hypotheses.

Amino acid metabolic costs differ similarly, constraining their incorporation into proteins. On the other hand, a diverse set of protein sequences is necessary to build functional proteomes. Here, we present a simple model for a cost-diversity trade-off postulating that natural proteomes minimize amino acid metabolic flux while maximizing sequence entropy. The model explains the relative abundances of amino acids across a diverse set of proteomes. We found that the data are remarkably well explained when the cost function accounts for amino acid chemical decay.

40|$|This paper investigates to {{what extent}} Structuralism {{influenced}} {{the work of the}} Japanese Metabolists. In 1960, the Metabolists stepped onto the international architectural scene with the presentation of their manifesto Metabolism 1960 at the World Design Conference in Tokyo. Throughout the 1960 s, they proposed a series of urban schemes where the city was envisioned as a growing and changeable organism constituted by two parts: a primary long-life ever-expanding infrastructure which supports secondary disposable elements necessary for urban life such as prefabricated housing capsules. Their schemes were characterized by an impressive use of technology and mega-structural scale. Obvious similarities can be observed between Metabolism’s and Structuralism’s design strategies such as, the use of identifiable repetitive elements, the allowance for growth and change, a distinction between primary structures with long-life cycle and secondary in-fills with shorter life cycles. However, the application of such methods and principles of design is not necessarily grounded in the theory of Structuralism. In their texts, the Metabolists argue that their theory and practice are firmly grounded in Japanese history and culture. Still, they were surely informed about the Structuralist ideas of Team 10; if not directly then through their mentor Kenzo Tange, who attended the 1959 CIAM in Otterlo and underpinned his Tokyo Bay Plan (1960) with a structuralist analysis. This paper examines Metabolist writings, projects and built works and observes the transition of concepts from texts to drawings to buildings.

Of far greater impact was the second paper in this series, showing that paracetamol was a metabolite of acetanilide in the blood. The third paper in the series reported that even large amounts of paracetamol (up to 4 grams per kg of body weight) did not produce methemoglobinemia in albino rats. This observation, together with later studies conducted by Bernard Brodie and Julius Axelrod led to the rediscovery of paracetamol as a drug.|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} in Paraisópolis are numerous, {{but these are}} the main problems concerning water and waste. São Paulo has a climate with a wet and a dry season. During the wet season, floods occur throughout the city, including Paraisópolis. But in the dry season, the entire city suffers from drought. This drought has intensified over the last years, because of climate change: the wet season has shortened and less rain falls each year. Because Paraisópolis is an informal neighbourhood, infrastructure is not regulated {{as it is in the}} rest of the city. Most houses are connected to the water grid, but not all connections are legal and safe. Likewise, not all houses are connected to the sewerage. Many connections are home-made and there’s also open sewerage, running through some streets, only covered with a grid. Also, solid waste is not always collected and the open sewerage is getting clogged with this solid waste. These various {{problems in}}terfere with each other. Because of the open sewerage, during flooding, waste material from lavatories is taken up and washed into the streets. Because of the street pattern and the height differences in the neighbourhood, this can effect a large area.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{mathematical}} models of cancer growth and treatment are presented. The most significant model presented {{is of the}} interactions between a growing tumor and the immune system. The equations and parameters of the model are based on experimental and clinical results from published studies. The model includes the primary cell populations involved in effector-T-cell-mediated tumor killing: regulatory T cells, helper T cells, and dendritic cells. A key feature is the inclusion of multiple mechanisms of immunosuppression through the main cytokines and growth factors mediating the interactions between the cell populations. Decreased access of effector cells to the tumor interior with increasing tumor size is accounted for. The model is applied to tumors of different growth rates and antigenicities to gauge {{the relative importance of}} the various immunosuppressive mechanisms in a tumor. The results suggest that there is an optimum antigenicity for maximal immune system effect. The immunosuppressive effects of further increases in antigenicity outweigh the increase in tumor cell control due to larger populations of tumor-killing effector T cells. The model is applied to situations involving cytoreductive treatment, specifically chemotherapy and a number of immunotherapies. The results how that for some types of tumors, the immune system is able to remove any tumor cells remaining after the therapy is finished. In other cases, the immune system acts to prolong remission periods. A number of immunotherapies are found to be ineffective at removing a tumor burden alone, but offer significant improvement on therapeutic outcome when used in combination with chemotherapy. Two simplified classes of cancer models are also presented. A model of cellular metabolism is formulated.

40|$|In {{his classic}} 1961 book, The Fire of Life, Max Kleiber {{presented}} {{a critique of}} the theories advanced to explain the BMR-body size relationship. One of the theories he dismissed was that the chemical composition of animals varies with body size. Since this time, however, much has been learned about the make-up of BMR in different animals as well as the chemical composition of different-sized animals. Specifically, in recent years it has become obvious that mammal species and bird species do vary in chemical composition in a systematic manner associated with the body size of the species. Small mammal and bird species have cellular membranes that are predominantly polyunsaturated, and as mammal and bird species increase in size, their cellular membranes become progressively less polyunsaturated. Since Kleiber 2 ̆ 7 s time, it has also become obvious that a substantial amount of the energy turnover of BMR is associated with the activity of membrane processes, specifically the maintenance of trans-membrane gradients, such as the Na+ gradient across the plasmalemmal membrane and the H+ gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The variation in both membrane composition and membrane processes associated with body size variation in metabolic rate has been combined in the `membrane pacemaker 2 ̆ 7 <b>theory</b> of <b>metabolism.</b> This <b>theory</b> proposes that: (1) membrane-associated activities are significant and dominant components of BMR; (2) when BMR varies among species, all the activities that constitute BMR vary in unison; (3) species with high mass-specific BMR have highly polyunsaturated membranes while those with low BMR have less polyunsaturation of their membranes; (4) highly polyunsaturated membranes have distinctive physical properties that cause the proteins in the membranes to have a high molecular activity, and this results in higher rates of metabolism of cells, tissues and, consequently, the whole animal. Evidence supporting this theory is both correlative and experimental. Manipulation of membrane composition changes the molecular activity of membrane proteins. These differences in membrane composition may also represent a link between metabolism and aging. They probably explain the lifespan-body size relationship in mammals and birds and also the mammal-bird difference in lifespan...|$|R
500|$|E. N. Harvey (1932) {{was among}} the first to propose how {{bioluminescence}} could have evolved. In this early paper, he suggested that proto-bioluminescence could have arisen from respiratory chain proteins that hold fluorescent groups. This hypothesis has since been disproven, but it did lead to considerable interest in the origins of the phenomenon. Today, the two prevailing hypotheses (both concerning marine bioluminescence) are the ones put forth by Seliger (1993) and Rees et al. (1998). Seliger's theory identifies luciferase enzymes as the catalyst for the evolution of bioluminescent systems. It suggests that the original purpose of luciferases was as mixed-function oxygenases. As the early ancestors of many species moved into deeper and darker waters natural selection applied forces that favored the development of increased eye sensitivity and enhanced visual signals. If selection were to favor a mutation in the oxygenase enzyme required for the breakdown of pigment molecules (molecules often associated with spots used to attract a mate or distract a predator) it could have eventually resulted in external luminescence in tissues. Rees et al. (1998) uses evidence gathered from the marine luciferin coelenterazine to suggest that selection acting on luciferins may have arisen from pressures to protect oceanic organisms from potentially deleterious reactive oxygen species (ROS) (e.g. H2O2 and O2− [...] ). The functional shift from antioxidation to bioluminescence probably occurred when the strength of selection for antioxidation defense decreased as early species moved further down the water column. At greater depths exposure to ROS is significantly lower, as is the endogenous production of ROS through <b>metabolism.</b> Seliger's <b>theory,</b> while popular at first, has been challenged particularly by the biochemical and genetic evidence that Rees examines. What remains clear, however, is that bioluminescence has evolved independently at least 40 times. Bioluminescence in fish began at least by the Cretaceous period. About 1,500 fish species are known to be bioluminescent; the capability evolved independently at least 27 times. Of these 27 occasions, 17 involved the taking up of bioluminous bacteria from the surrounding water while in the others, the intrinsic light evolved through chemical synthesis. These fish have become surprisingly diverse in the deep ocean and control their light with the help of their nervous system, using it not just to lure prey or hide from predators, but also for communication.|$|R
40|$|Body size {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} biological characteristics of species. Among reef fishes, size is globally unevenly distributed, species being on average larger in the Atlantic and tropical eastern Pacific (TEP) than in the Indo-Pacific. This is related to species diversity and also probably linked to the history of these regions. Species size is related to numerous biological and ecological characteristics. Here we show the links between size and diet, home range, depth range, and geographical range. The large-scale distribution of species size has important implications at the local level. In particular small species tend to be more abundant than larger ones, which combined with the relationship between species diversity and species size implies higher abundances in species rich zones. Large species being in general more vulnerable to fishing than small ones, this also implies that reef fish assemblages from the Atlantic and TEP will be more vulnerable to a given rate of fishing mortality than those from the Indo-Pacific, all other factors being equal. A conceptual framework on the relationships between species richness, abundance, and biomass is proposed. It shows that the species size distribution within a regional pool, combined with regional and local species richness, may determine in great part the potential response of local assemblages to perturbations. Body size is a central species parameter in ecology. Ecologists have been looking for general rules linking species' body size to many parameters [27, 36], in particular to geographical distribution [274, 917], temperature (see review by Angilletta [80]), <b>metabolism</b> (see initial <b>theory</b> by Brown [358]), abundance within populations and assemblages at various spatial scales (see review by White [2660]), and vulnerability [e. g. 322, 645, 1873, 1965].

40|$|Understanding {{the impact}} of warming on organisms, {{communities}} and ecosystems is a central problem in ecology. Although species responses to warming are well documented, our ability to scale up to predict community and ecosystem properties is limited. Improving understanding of the mechanisms that link patterns and processes over multiple levels of organisation and across spatial and temporal scales promises to enhance our ability to predict whether the biosphere will exacerbate, or mitigate, climate warming. In this thesis, I combine ideas from metabolic theory {{with a variety of}} experimental approaches to further our understanding of how warming will impact photosynthesis and respiration across scales. Firstly, I show how phytoplankton can rapidly evolve increased thermal tolerance by downregulating rates of respiration more than photosynthesis. This increased carbon-use efficiency meant that evolved populations allocated more fixed carbon to growth. I then explore how constraints on individual physiology and community size structure influence phytoplankton community <b>metabolism.</b> Using metabolic <b>theory,</b> I link community primary production and respiration to the size- and temperature- dependence of individual physiology and the distribution of abundance and body size. Finally, I show that selection on photosynthetic traits within and across taxa dampens the effects of temperature on ecosystem-level gross primary production in a set of geothermal streams. Across the thermal-gradient, autotrophs from cold streams had higher photosynthetic rates than autotrophs from warm streams. At the ecosystem-level, the temperature-dependence of gross primary productivity was similar to that of organism-level photosynthesis. However, this was due to covariance between biomass and stream temperature; after accounting for the effects of biomass, gross primary productivity was independent of temperature. Collectively, this work emphasises the importance of ecological, evolutionary and physiological mechanisms that shape how metabolism responds to warming over multiple levels of organisation.

In the work here, the diverse microbial community is resolved using metabolic functional types, which represent metabolisms {{as a function}} of their underlying redox chemistry and physiology. In Chapter 2, I use a simple model to predict the limiting oxygen concentration of aerobic microbial growth in an ecosystem. This limiting concentration is in the nanomolar range for much of the parameter space that describes microbial activity in marine environments, and so anticipates the recent measurements of oxygen to nanomolar concentrations or lower in anoxic zones. Anaerobic metabolisms should become favorable at this limiting concentration. The model provides a parameterization for dynamic oxygen depletion and limitation, without a prescribed critical oxygen concentration. In Chapter 3, I extend the above analysis to determine the full set of conditions required for favorable anaerobic <b>metabolism.</b> Resource ratio <b>theory</b> is used to explain the competitive exclusion of anaerobic metabolisms in oxygenated environments as well as the stable coexistence of aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms when oxygen is limiting. The onset of this coexistence {{is a function of the}} relative availability of oxygen and a mutually required substrate. Results hypothesize the likelihood of coexisting aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms at limiting oxygen concentrations, which is consistent with observations. These dynamics are demonstrated in an idealized oxygen minimum zone model. In Chapter 4, I use a mechanistic description of nitrification to explain the location and intensity of the primary nitrite maximum. First, competition with phytoplankton excludes nitrification from the sunlit layer of the ocean, resulting in peak nitrification at depth, as widely observed. Second, differences in the metabolisms of the microbial clades responsible for the two steps of nitrification explain why nitrite accumulates consistently as an intermediate. The model provides a dynamic resolution of nitrification in the ocean. It predicts that nitrification is favorable in sunlit waters where phytoplankton growth is limited by light or by a substrate other than reduced inorganic nitrogen. by Emily Juliette Zakem.

40|$|In {{evolutionary}} biology, ageing {{is usually}} {{defined as a}} persistent decline in the age-specific fitness components of an organism due to internal physiological deterioration. This definition integrates effects on reproduction and survival. Gerontologists simply define ageing as {{an increase in the}} likelihood that an individual will die in a certain time interval. As we age, intracellular processes degenerate and ultimately fail. This can lead to age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, Parkinson’s disease etc., and ultimately to death. There has been much speculation on the role of energy metabolism in the causation of these processes. This has {{led to the formation of}} several intriguing theories which attribute the causation of death ultimately to the very motor of life itself; the rate of living theory (Pearl, 1928; Rubner, 1908) and free radical theory of ageing (Harman, 1956). This idea was summarized by Murray (1926) in the statement: ‘If aliveness is measured by the velocity of chemical activity (heat production) an organism may in this sense be said to dig its own grave. The more abundant its manifestations of life, the greater will be its rate of senescence’. The primary aim of this thesis was to investigate the relationship between ageing and metabolic rate. In two large-scale experiments I manipulated the energy expenditure of a group of animals by either increasing their physical activity or exposing them to cold. Survival curves were created for different experimental groups and I looked at changes that occurred in several physiological parameters that might be involved in ageing to explain differences that occurred in life span (Part II: Metabolism & Ageing). In addition, I explored the behavioural and physiological consequences of changes in energy balance in mice that had been selectively bred for high levels of spontaneous physical activity (Part I: Activity & Metabolism). PART I: Activity & <b>Metabolism</b> Life history <b>theory</b> The evolution of life histories has been explained by the presence of limited resources that results in trade-offs between survival (maintenance of the body) and reproduction (Stearns, 2000). In times of plenty, resources can be allocated to growth and reproduction, but when resources are scarce, energy has to be allocated to enable survival of the individual and future success. In many species the reproductive season is tuned to coincide with the peak in food availability. When food is scarce, reproduction ceases and energy is allocated to increase the chance of survival into the next year. There is a large variation in the way animals deal with such trade-offs. When there is a genetic basis for these decisions, natural selection favours life-history traits that result in a higher fitness. The main environmental factors influencing the available resources for endothermic animals are environmental temperature and food availability. In part I of this thesis we investigated the effects of low ambient temperatures or food availability on metabolism and the amount of voluntary activity mice were willing to engage. We used mice that had been selected by T. Garland Jr. for high wheel-running activity and their random-bred controls. Detailed description of the selection protocol and the main characteristics of these mice is provided in box 1. 1. The amount of wheel-running activity was the selection criteria. After 31 generations of selection the mice ran approximately 2, 7 times as much as control animals (Rhodes et al., 2005). With the selection for wheel-running activity other traits have been co-selected (i. e. small body size) and much research has been undertaken to uncover these co-selected traits. In chapter 2 we investigate mice exposed to various ambient temperatures. We measured wheel-running activity and metabolic rate simultaneously to determine whether high-activity mice have evolved to have a lower running economy and whether they would more likely use heat generated by activity to substitute for thermoregulatory heat at low ambient temperatures than control mice do. In chapter 3 we manipulated food availability using a system in which animals had to run in a running wheel for a set number of revolutions to obtain a food pellets. This approach was used to study effects of food availability on physiological and behavioural responses in control and selected mice. Previous studies in rats by T. Adage showed that rats with low spontaneous levels of wheel-running activity have more difficulties to cope with a workload schedule than rats with high spontaneous levels of wheel-running activity. Similar effects were expected between control and high-activity mice. Exercise & obesity Obesity is becoming an increasingly prevalent health problem in affluent societies. It is often associated with metabolic derangements such as impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and abdominal obesity. When these metabolic abnormalities are displayed in concert (often referred to as the “metabolic syndrome”), they entail a high risk of developing into life-threatening conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus type 2 (for review see (Carroll and Dudfield, 2004; Moller and Kaufman, 2005)). Increased dietary fat intake in combination with a sedentary existence are factors precipitating the development of obesity and the associated metabolic syndrome. Adipose tissue produces several hormones, such as leptin and adiponectin, that are important for energy homeostasis. Levels of these hormones are associated with metabolic risk factors. Adiponectin levels are decreased and leptin levels increased in obese compared with lean subjects (Park et al., 2004). Mice that have been selected for high wheel-running activity (for detailed description see box 1. 1.) have decreased levels of leptin even when correcting for fat mass (Girard et al., 2006). Leptin is produced by adipose tissue and informs the body about its available fat stores and is involved in regulating food intake. Selected mice have a high food intake to cover the increased costs of wheel-running activity (Swallow et al., 2001 a), and lowering levels of leptin may be an adaptation to increase food intake and maintain energy balance. High-activity mice have a lean phenotype (Dumke et al., 2001; Swallow et al., 1999 a) and adiponectin levels are thus expected to be increased in high-activity mice. This together with low levels of leptin might make high-activity mice less prone to develop metabolic derangements on a high-fat diet and would make these mice a suitable model to study the metabolic syndrome. In chapter 4 we measured hormone levels of leptin, adiponectin and corticosterone in aging male mice selected for high wheel-running activity and their random-bred controls. We studied correlations between the hormones and body composition. In chapter 5 we describe a study in which we exposed selected males and females to a high fat diet. Body composition, food efficiency, energy metabolism and glucose tolerance were tested to determine whether high-activity mice responded differently to a high-fat diet than controls. Part II: Metabolism & Ageing “Rate of living” and “free radical” theory of ageing Instinctively we know that things (cars, machines) break down faster if you use them more often and more intensively. The same might be applicable to animal (and human) life. This notion that the rate of energy turnover determines the rate of breakdown is known as the “rate of living” theory (Pearl, 1928). In 1908, Rubner noted that food intake per gram decreased with increasing life span among five domestic animals (guinea pig, cat, dog, cow and horse). He calculated the energy intake per gram per life span (life-time energy potential, LEP) and found that the variation in LEP between species was small (1, 5 fold), although the variation in body mass was very large. Including data for men the variation in life-time energy expenditure was slightly larger, but still only 5 -fold. He concluded that mass-specific energy metabolism times the maximal lifespan was a constant (Rubner, 1908). Energy metabolism might thus be the factor that determines our life span. In 1928 Pearl postulated the “rate of living theory” that states that there is an inverse relationship between energy expenditure and life span (Pearl, 1928). An extensive body of evidence exists that is consistent with this theory. Comparative studies have shown that energy expenditure tends to show an inverse relationship with body size and longevity when compared across mammalian or bird species (Ku et al., 1993; Speakman, 2005 a). Also evidence from intra-specific studies show evidence for the rate of living theory. Increasing ambient temperature (and thereby energy expenditure) decreased life span of nematodes proportionally (Van Voorhies and Ward, 1999). Honey bees that were forced to fly with extra loads had decreased life spans (Wolf and Schmid-Hempel, 1989), and flies prohibited to fly (thereby decreasing metabolic rate) had increased life spans (Yan and Sohal, 2000). Brood size increases in kestrels resulted in increased energy turnover and a subsequent decrease in the survival of parents that had enlarged broods (Daan et al., 1996). In hibernating hamsters survival was higher than in hamsters that did not hibernate (Lyman et al., 1981). A moderate increase of the level of basal metabolism of young adult rats adapted to hypergravity compared to controls in normal gravity was accompanied by a roughly similar increase in the rate of organ aging and reduction of survival (Economos et al., 1982). In contrast there are also numerous studies that showed no relationship or a positive relationship between energy expenditure and life span (in mammals (Holloszy and Smith, 1987; Holloszy and Smith, 1986; Navarro et al., 2004; 2003; Speakman et al., 2004)), and comparative studies show that for a certain body mass birds expend up|$|R
