40|$|A new fungus, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), was {{identified}} in wild populations of salamanders in the Netherlands and Belgium, and in kept salamander populations in Germany and the United Kingdom. EFSA assessed {{the potential of}} Bsal to affect the health of wild and kept salamanders in the EU, the effectiveness and feasibility of a <b>movement</b> <b>ban</b> of traded salamanders, the validity, reliability and robustness of available diagnostic methods for Bsal detection, and possible alternative methods and feasible risk mitigation measures to ensure safe international and EU trade of salamanders and their products. Bsal was isolated and characterised in 2013 from a declining fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) population in the Netherlands. Based on the available evidence, {{it is likely that}} Bsal is a sufficient cause for the death of S. salamandra both in the laboratory and in the wild. Despite small sample sizes, the available experimental evidence indicates that Bsal is associated with disease and death in individuals of 12 European and 3 Asian salamander species, and with high mortality rate outbreaks in kept salamanders. Bsal experimental infection was detected in individuals of at least one species pertaining to the families Salamandridae, Plethodontidae, Hynobiidae and Sirenidae. Movement bans constitute key risk mitigation measures to prevent pathogen spread into naïve areas and populations. The effectiveness of a <b>movement</b> <b>ban</b> is mainly dependent on the import volumes, possibility of Bsal to remain viable outside susceptible/tolerant species, and the capacity to limit illegal movements. Duplex real-time PCR can be used to detect Bsal DNA, but has not been fully validated. Quarantining salamanders, enacting legislation that requires testing of animals to demonstrate freedom from Bsal, before movement can take place, restricting salamander movements, tracking all traded species, hygienic procedures/biosecurity measures before and during movements, and increasing public awareness are relevant measures for ensuring safe intra-EU and international trade of salamanders...|$|E

40|$|Bluetongue is a {{notifiable}} {{disease of}} ruminants which, in 2007, occurred {{for the first}} time in England. We present the first model for bluetongue that explicitly incorporates farm to farm movements of the two main hosts, as well as vector dispersal. The model also includes a seasonal vector to host ratio and dynamic restriction zones that evolve as infection is detected. Batch movements of sheep were included by modelling degree of mixing at markets. We investigate the transmission of bluetongue virus between farms in eastern England (the focus of the outbreak). Results indicate that most parameters affecting outbreak size relate to vectors and that the infection generally cannot be maintained without between-herd vector transmission. Movement restrictions are effective at reducing outbreak size, and a targeted approach would be as effective as a total <b>movement</b> <b>ban.</b> The model framework is flexible and can be adapted to other vector-borne diseases of livestock...|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} {{epidemic}} dispersal (based {{on the assumption}} that susceptible cattle were homogeneously mixed over space, or non-spatial model) was compared to a partially spa-tially explicit and discrete model (the spatial model), which was composed of dierential equations and used geo-coded data (Euclidean distances between county centroids). While the spatial model accounted for intra-county and inter-county epidemic spread, the non-spatial model did not assess regional dierences. A geo-coded dataset that resembled conditions favouring homogeneous mixing assumptions (based on the 2001 Uruguayan foot-and-mouth disease epidemic), was used for testing. Signi cant dierences between models were observed in the average transmission rate between farms, both before and after a control policy (animal <b>movement</b> <b>ban)</b> was im-posed. They also diered in terms of daily number of infected farms: the non-spatial model revealed a single epidemic peak (at, approximately, 25 epidemic days); while the spatial model revealed two epidemic peaks (at, approximately, 12 and 28 days, respec-tively).

40|$|In this paper, we {{simulate}} {{outbreaks of}} foot-and-mouth {{disease in the}} Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, USA – after {{the introduction of a}} state-wide <b>movement</b> <b>ban</b> – as they might unfold in the presence of mitigation strategies. We have adapted a model previously used to investigate FMD control policies in the UK to examine the potential for disease spread given an infection seeded in each county in Pennsylvania. The results are highly dependent upon the county of introduction and the spatial scale of transmission. Should the transmission kernel be identical to that for the UK, the epidemic impact is limited to fewer than 20 premises, regardless of the county of introduction. However, for wider kernels where infection can spread further, outbreaks seeded in or near the county with highest density of premises and animals result in large epidemics (> 150 premises). Ring culling and vaccination reduce epidemic size, with the optimal radius of the rings being dependent upon the county of introduction. Should the kernel width exceed a given county-dependent threshold, ring culling is unable to control the epidemic. We find that a vaccinate-to-live policy is generally preferred to ring culling (in terms of reducing the overall number of premises culled), indicating that well-targeted control can dramatically reduce the risk of large scale outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease occurring in Pennsylvania...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Models of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) {{transmission}} {{have assumed}} a homogeneous landscape across which Euclidean distance is a suitable {{measure of the}} spatial dependency of transmission. This paper investigated features of the landscape {{and their impact on}} transmission during the period of predominantly local spread which followed the implementation of the national <b>movement</b> <b>ban</b> during the 2001 UK FMD epidemic. In this study 113 farms diagnosed with FMD which had a known source of infection within 3 km (cases) were matched to 188 control farms which were either uninfected or infected at a later timepoint. Cases were matched to controls by Euclidean distance to the source of infection and farm size. Intervening geographical features and connectivity between the source of infection and case and controls were compared. Results Road distance between holdings, access to holdings, presence of forest, elevation change between holdings and the presence of intervening roads had no impact on the risk of local FMD transmission (p > 0. 2). However the presence of linear features in the form of rivers and railways acted as barriers to FMD transmission (odds ratio = 0. 507, 95 % CIs = 0. 297, 0. 887, p = 0. 018). Conclusion This paper demonstrated that although FMD spread can generally be modelled using Euclidean distance and numbers of animals on susceptible holdings, the presence of rivers and railways has an additional protective effect reducing the probability of transmission between holdings. </p...|$|E
40|$|Estimating {{detailed}} transmission {{trees that}} reflect the relationships between infected individuals or populations during a disease outbreak often provides valuable insights into both the nature of disease transmission and the overall dynamics of the underlying epidemiological process. These trees may be based on epidemiological data {{that relate to the}} timing of infection and infectiousness, or genetic data that show the genetic relatedness of pathogens isolated from infected individuals. Genetic data are becoming increasingly important in the estimation of transmission trees of viral pathogens due to their inherently high mutation rate. Here, we propose a maximum-likelihood approach that allows epidemiological and genetic data to be combined within the same analysis to infer probable transmission trees. We apply this approach to data from 20 farms infected during the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, using complete viral genome sequences from each infected farm and information on when farms were first estimated to have developed clinical disease and when livestock on these farms were culled. Incorporating known infection links due to animal movement prior to imposition of the national <b>movement</b> <b>ban</b> results in the reduction of the number of trees from 41   472 that are consistent with the genetic data to 1728, of which just 4 represent more than 95 % of the total likelihood calculated using a model that accounts for the epidemiological data. These trees differ in several ways from those constructed prior to the availability of genetic data...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the summer}} of 2011 Schmallenberg virus (SBV), a Culicoides-borne orthobunyavirus, emerged in Germany and The Netherlands and {{subsequently}} spread across much of Europe. To draw inferences about the transmission of SBV we have developed two models to describe its spread within and between farms. The within-farm model was fitted to seroprevalence data for cattle and sheep farms in Belgium and The Netherlands, with parameters estimated using approximate Bayesian computation. Despite the short duration of viraemia in cattle and sheep (mean of 3 – 4 days) the within-farm seroprevalence can reach high levels (mean within-herd seroprevalence > 80 %), largely because the probability of transmission from host to vector is high (14 %) and SBV is able to replicate quickly (0. 03 per day-degree) and at relatively low temperatures (threshold for replication: 12. 3 °C). Parameter estimates from the within-farm model were then used in a separate between-farm model to simulate the regional spread of SBV. This showed that the rapid spread of SBV at a regional level is primarily {{a consequence of the}} high probability of transmission from host to vector and the temperature requirements for virus replication. Our results, obtained for a region of the UK in a typical year with regard to animal movements, indicate that {{there is no need to}} invoke additional transmission mechanisms to explain the observed patterns of rapid spread of SBV in Europe. Moreover, the imposition of movement restrictions, even a total <b>movement</b> <b>ban,</b> has little effect on the spread of SBV at this scale...|$|E
