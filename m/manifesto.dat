5|$|Contrary to its {{misleading}} title, the <b>Manifesto</b> of the Sixteen {{had originally}} fifteen signatories—among them {{some of the}} most eminent anarchists in Europe—and was later countersigned by another hundred. The position of the <b>Manifesto</b> was in stark contrast to that of most anarchists of the day, many of whom denounced its signatories and their sympathizers, and accused them of betraying anarchist principles. In the fallout over the war, Kropotkin became increasingly isolated, with many former friends cutting their ties to him. The Russian anarchist movement was split into two, with a faction supporting Kropotkin's position to the strong criticism of the Bolsheviks. Elsewhere in Europe, including in the Spanish and Swiss anarchist movements, the dismissal of the <b>Manifesto</b> was overwhelming, with supporters being angrily denounced and marginalized.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study how the {{conservatism}} have changed in the conservative party in the United Kingdom and what influence the party leader seems to have over the party ideology. To answer this purpose an idea analysis is used and a material consisting of election <b>manifestos</b> from three periods of the party´s history (Churchill, Thatcher and Cameron) but even political biographies of the leaders. The result shows some difference between the <b>manifestos</b> and the leaders, but even some similarities. One difference, but also a similarity over time, is the view of a cooperation in Europe. Churchill’s <b>manifestos</b> are positive to a cooperation between nations in Europe, Thatcher and Cameron there <b>manifestos</b> share the same skeptics against a further European cooperation. One similarity over time is the support for family as one of the central values in the country. About the leaders and the <b>manifestos</b> there are some similarities, but also some difference between them. Example of similarities are Churchill and the <b>manifestos</b> support full employment, Thatcher and the <b>manifestos</b> support aim on inflation. Cameron is personally divvied in his relation to trade unions and so is the <b>manifestos.</b>  One difference between Churchill and the <b>manifestos</b> is that Churchill accepted capital punishment, but the <b>manifestos</b> never take a stand in this issue. Thatcher and the <b>manifestos</b> don’t share the same view on homosexuality rights, Thatcher is negative and the <b>manifestos</b> not even take a stand. Cameron´s view on privatization is unown, but the <b>manifestos</b> are positive. ...|$|R

Van Zandt's second analytical team determined an even higher likelihood that the letters and the <b>manifesto</b> were the product of the same author.

40|$|From methodological {{perspective}} {{we address}} a substantive question {{of political science}} research. What are similarities and differences in issue structures in contemporary democracies? Issue structures are recognized {{on the basis of}} the content of national electoral programmes (<b>manifestos)</b> in the period from 1992 to 2003. In analyses, we use multivariate clustering methods first to obtain groups of countries as aggregates of <b>manifestos</b> and then to obtain groups of <b>manifestos.</b> Eventually countries are categorised drawing on the importance of four different types of <b>manifestos</b> in a country. The results are, whenever possible, graphically presented as line graphs, dendrograms and a galaxy.

5|$|After {{the events}} of Bloody Sunday in January 1905 sparked a {{revolution}} in Russia, Tsar Nicholas II was forced to make concessions. In April 1905 a decree guaranteed complete freedom of religion, and even allowed religious studies to be conducted in native languages. The most important decree, the October <b>Manifesto,</b> was announced on October 30 (October 17 O.S.), 1905. It guaranteed many political rights, {{including the right to}} form political parties and organize convocations. This decree formed the legal basis for the assembly in Vilnius. The October <b>Manifesto</b> also announced the intent to hold elections to the Russian Parliament (Duma), and the Lithuanian organizers used this as an official pretext for the Seimas: they claimed that the Lithuanians needed to prepare themselves for this election.|$|E

40|$|This paper builds {{upon the}} {{theoretical}} premises developed by Erik O.

We focus on a particular dimension of parliamentary representation, namely, party politics at the European level, and we concentrate on the 2009 European election party <b>manifestoes.</b> We hypothesise that under the delegated democracy model there should hardly be any similarities between the Euro-party and their member party <b>manifestoes.</b> The opposite should hold for the federal model, whereas {{in the case of the}} regional-cosmopolitan model the <b>manifestoes</b> should have a post-national outlook. Even though most <b>manifestoes</b> have a discernible European outlook and the national and Euro-party <b>manifestoes</b> share a number of common features, the differences remain more than the similarities. Our empirical findings suggest that the PES, the EPP and the EGP cannot be placed under the same EU democracy model. (authors' abstract...|$|R

5|$|The Greater London Labour <b>Manifesto</b> for the 1981 elections, {{although}} written under McIntosh's leadership, {{had been}} {{determined by a}} special conference of the London Labour Party in October 1980 in which Livingstone's speech had been decisive on transport policy. The <b>manifesto</b> focused on job creation schemes and cutting London Transport fares, and it was to these issues that Livingstone's administration turned. One primary <b>manifesto</b> focus had been a pledge known as Fares Fair, which focused on reducing London Underground fares and freezing them at that lower rate. Based on a fare freeze implemented by the South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council in 1975, it was widely {{considered to be a}} moderate and mainstream policy by Labour, which it was hoped would get more Londoners using public transport, thereby reducing congestion. In October 1981, the GLC implemented their policy, cutting London Transport fares by 32%; to fund the move, the GLC planned to increase the London rates.|$|E

The paper {{analyses}} the Europeanisation {{of election}} <b>manifestos</b> of major relevant {{political parties in}} the Slovak Republic between 1994 and 2010.

The authors conclude that the process of the Europeanisation of political parties began a little later in Slovakia in comparison to some of the countries which became democratized slightly earlier (e. g. the Czech Republic). A different pace of democratization, experience with Mečiar’s hybrid regime, and the multi-dimensional party system seem to be the main reasons for the “backwardness” of Slovak political parties’ <b>manifestoes...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{indirect}} effects of Europeanization on national political parties.   I argue that Europeanization {{has affected the}} way national parties operate, and communicate with the voters, by restricting the national policy space through increased economic and political integration. Furthermore, I argue {{that the impact of}} Europeanization is likely to be reflected in electoral <b>manifestos</b> and changed patterns of party competition. Accordingly, Europeanization is hypothesized to change party rhetoric in a cartel-like manner by diminishing voters’ expectations, and also by avoiding EU-affairs in electoral <b>manifestos.</b> The hypothesis suggests, moreover, that Europeanization is reflected in convergence among parties regarding the rhetoric concerning EU-affairs.   The purpose of the thesis is to examine to what extent the rhetoric concerning EU-affairs has changed in electoral <b>manifestos</b> sinceSwedenjoined the European Union in 1995. The political parties examined are Socialdemokraterna, Moderaterna and Miljöpartiet. The parties’ electoral <b>manifestos,</b> from the period 1994 - 2010, are analysed through quantitative and qualitative content analysis. Subsequently, analyses from a comparison between results from earlier <b>manifestos</b> and older ones are evaluated.   The thesis concludes that the space given to EU-affairs in electoral <b>manifestos</b> consistently decrease and that the rhetoric tends to become vaguer over time. In conclusion, this result might indicate that the parties avoid debating the EU-affairs. Yet, the empirical analysis finds no signs of convergence among the parties. ...|$|R
