Our focus on term vectors is motivated by recent success of co-occurrence based measures of semantic similarity obtained from very large corpora. Our experiments demonstrate that GLSA term vectors efficiently capture semantic relations between terms and outperform related approaches on the synonymy test. We also show that termbased document representation improves performance on the document classification test. ...|$|E
40|$|Medical {{terminology}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} dynamic terminological domains, and the choice of one term instead of the other is not random, but the result of different perspectives towards reality. VariMed is a research project on medical term variants and its overall objective is to generate a multifunctional resource on the medical domain for linguistic research, translation and technical writing. In this pa-per, we propose a systematic way of extracting term variants from large corpora within the subdo-main of Psychiatry and how to represent them according to cognitive and communicative parame-ters. Our aim is to discover if different conceptualizations, or different conceptually <b>motivated</b> <b>term</b> variants, of the same concept are preferred in expert or semi-specialized communication. A corpus on Psychiatry was compiled and classified according to user types. A grammar was designed in NooJ (Sil-berztein, 2003) in order to extract term variants based on the usual lexico-syntactic patterns accom-panying synonyms (also known as; commonly referred to as, etc.). Corpus analysis results indicate that, from a cognitive perspective, term variants reflect the prototypical dimensions in which psychiatric disorders may be classified. From a communicative perspective, terms and dimensions can also be as-sociated with user-based parameters...|$|E

40|$|It {{is found}} that the vacuum triode, transistor, {{monolithic}} circuit and microprocessor {{were the most important}} inventions of traditional electronics. Thus, the origins of the traditional electronics should be associated with the invention of the vacuum triode, but not with the invention of vacuum diode. It is shown that the science of electronics is not as young as computer science or up-to-date information technologies: electronics, including active electronics, had already celebrated the centenary, and the period of 2004 – 2008 is the period of numerous already solid jubilees. Thus, the terminology of electronics is not at initial stage of evolution as well – general terms should be already systematized and normalized. However, Lithuanian terms for electronic devices invented before tens of years and terms for old-defined notions associated with these devices are still varying, some are worsened. Especially, the incorrectly <b>motivated</b> <b>terms</b> used for variations of transistors and microcircuits are analyzed in the article. It is <b>motivated</b> which <b>terms</b> are preferable, systematic and exact.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we are dealing}} with the {{numerical}} computation of the one dimensionaltwo-fluid model. The main objective has been to develop a robust numericalmethod for incompressible flow which can be applied for both gas-liquidflow and liquid-liquid flow. A new finite volume method called the Mixture-SlipFlux Splitting (MSFS) method is proposed. This method distributes the numericalmass and momentum fluxes onto a mixture flux and a slip flux, using thesign of the mixture velocity and the slip velocity to determine the upstream values. This method has demonstrated good stability properties for the challengingproblem with transition to single phase flow, but is in general less accurate thanthe traditional upstream methods. In order to solve the incompressible two-fluid model with good accuracy inthe two-phase domain, we proposed a Roe scheme with a novel Roe matrix forthe incompressible two-fluid model. The Roe scheme was also extended to 2 ndorder. The Roe scheme and the MSFS method was then combined into a hybridmethod where the Roe scheme was used in the two-phase flow area and theMSFS method was used in the single phase area. This hybrid method allowedfor good accuracy in two phase flow while it made it possible to simulate intothe single phase flow area. The hybrid Roe-MSFS method was then used to simulate slug flow usingthe slug-capturing technique. In order to remedy the ill-posedness of the twofluidmodel, a mathematical <b>motivated</b> <b>term</b> was added to the equation setwhich made the two-fluid model unconditionally hyperbolic. The result fromthe slug-capturing simulations showed that the results were sensitive to boththe time step and the grid resolution. Moreover, as the grid was refined the slugdistribution did not converge to a unique solution. The MSFS method was also tested for compressible two phase flow. For thispurpose we used a staggered grid and applied the MSFS discretization methodfor the mass fluxes. In this case we observed improved numerical behavior forthe single phase transition compared to a classical upstream method. However,in the two phase region for purely upstream conditions the MSFS method failedto converge. PhD i energi- og prosessteknikkPhD in Energy and Process Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|The article {{considers}} that conceptual frameworks exist not to portray truth as an absolute, {{but rather to}} provide order and guidance to actions and behavior. From such perspective, the article {{considers that}} ethical frameworks assist in our attempt to balance the instinct {{that we have to}} look out for our own individual welfare with the conscience of obligation that we have to care for a wider community. In this light, the development of ethical frameworks may be interpreted in terms of a process of natural selection with regard to the mutual interdependence of the individual and the community. Thereby, the article argues that corporate and financial ethics do not exist ''to do good'', but rather to act reflexively to *I$Lconsolidate$L and *I$Lsanction$L internal activity, with the consequence that the employee is called on to be ethical not on the individual's own terms, but on the profit- <b>motivated</b> <b>terms</b> of the institution. The net outcome is that institutionalized activity may be co-ordinated to function under the banner of ethical codes of practice, while broader ethical issues for the institution as a whole remain suppressed. We illustrate these arguments with reference to the financial ethics of the Grameen Bank of Professor Muhammad Yunus. Notwithstanding, the example holds out the possibility that ethical concerns for the whole of society might ultimately be compatible with the profit motives of our institutionalised society.

40|$|Since the mid- 1990 ’s several {{claims for}} the return of the Mapungubwe human remains were made by {{indigenous}} communities, while some archaeologists felt that a pro-active process for repatriation should be initiated. The National Heritage Resource Act (Act 25 of 1999) made repatriation possible, but no regulations setting a procedure were promulgated. In 2004, Draft Regulations were circulated by the South African Heritage Resource Act. Comments raised in reply were used by the Department of Anatomy (UP) to develop a repatriation policy. During this time the Deputy Minister of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism was tasked by the President to arrange the repatriation of all the Mapungubwe remains (including associated sites). She established a Steering Committee consisting of various stakeholders: institutions holding remains, communities claiming the remains and Government institutions with a stake in heritage and conservation. Important compromises were achieved: although all Mapungubwe human remains were repatriated, they were buried in sealed containers in tomb structures on principal sites in hope that they would be well preserved and be available for future research. No samples for destructive analyses (DNA, chemical) prior to re-burial were, however, allowed. All the remains, apart from those from Schroda, were documented (Buikstra and Ubelaker, 1994). The remains were sealed in plastic bags and packed in high density foam in 143 PVC containers (one individual per box) which were welded shut to achieve an airtight seal. The involvement of politicians and government officials confounded the process (e. g., due to internal issues, the ceremonial part of the reburial was cancelled) and better results would have been achieved had the holding institutions followed a pro-active approach and initiated discussions with the claimant communities directly, rather than wait until they were forced to engage on politically <b>motivated</b> <b>terms.</b> Poster presented at the University of Pretoria Health Sciences Faculty Day, August 2008, Pretoria, South Africa...|$|R
