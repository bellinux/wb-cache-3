40|$|A {{vast number}} of very {{successful}} applications of <b>Memetic</b> algorithms (MAs) {{have been reported in}} the literature in the last years for a wide range of problem domains. The majority of the papers dealing with MAs are the result of the combination of highly specialised preexisting local searchers and usually purpose-speci c genetic operators. Moreover, those algorithms require a considerable eort devoted to the tuning of the local search and evolutionary parts of the algorithm. We have demonstrated in our previous work (see references below), that given a range of possible local search strategies available to a <b>Memetic</b> Algorithm, the optimal choice of which one must be used is not only problem and instance dependent but also tightly related to the state of the search process itself. We also showed that it is indeed possible to produce <b>Memetic</b> Algorithms that adapt on-the-y to those situations for a variety of problem domains.
