25|$|Low-voltage {{miniature}} {{circuit breakers}} (MCB) use air alone to extinguish the arc. These circuit breakers contain so-called arc chutes, a stack of mutually insulated parallel metal plates which divide and cool the arc. By splitting the arc into smaller arcs the arc is cooled down while the arc voltage is increased and serves as an additional impedance which limits the current through the circuit breaker. The current-carrying parts near the contacts provide easy deflection of the arc into the arc chutes by a magnetic force of a current path, although <b>magnetic</b> <b>blowout</b> coils or permanent magnets could also deflect the arc into the arc chute (used on circuit breakers for higher ratings).So The number of plates in the arc chute {{is dependent on the}} short-circuit rating and nominal voltage of the circuit breaker.|$|E
50|$|Elihu Thomson of Thomson-Houston was {{concerned}} about AC safety and put {{a great deal of}} effort into developing a lightning arrestor for high-tension power lines as well as a <b>magnetic</b> <b>blowout</b> switch that could shut the system down in a power surge, a safety feature the Westinghouse system did not have. Thomson also worried what would happen with the equipment after they sold it, assuming customers would follow a risky practice of installing as many lights and generators as they could get away with. He also thought the idea of using AC lighting in residential homes was too dangerous and had the company hold back on that type of installations until a safer transformer could be developed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>blowouts</b> use blowout coils to {{lengthen}} {{and move the}} electric arc. These are especially useful in DC power circuits. AC arcs have periods of low current, during which the arc can be extinguished with relative ease, but DC arcs have continuous high current, so blowing them out requires the arc to be stretched further than an AC arc of the same current. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>blowouts</b> in the pictured Albright contactor (which is designed for DC currents) {{more than double the}} current it can break, increasing it from 600 A to 1,500 A.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the {{detailed}} analysis of recurrent homologous jets originating from an emerging negative magnetic flux {{at the edge of}} an Active Region. The observed jets show multi-thermal features. Their evolution shows high consistence with the characteristic parameters of the emerging flux, suggesting that with more free magnetic energy, the eruptions tend to be more violent, frequent and blowout-like. The average temperature, average electron number density and axial speed are found to be similar for different jets, indicating that they should have been formed by plasmas from similar origins. Statistical analysis of the jets and their footpoint region conditions reveals a strong positive relationship between the footpoint-region total 131 Å intensity enhancement and jets' length/width. Stronger linearly positive relationships also exist between the total intensity enhancement/thermal energy of the footpoint regions and jets' mass/kinetic/thermal energy, with higher cross-correlation coefficients. All the above results, together, confirm the direct relationship between the magnetic reconnection and the jets, and validate the important role of magnetic reconnection in transporting large amount of free magnetic energy into jets. It is also suggested that there should be more free energy released during the <b>magnetic</b> reconnection of <b>blowout</b> than of standard jet events. Comment: 9 pages, 7 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
50|$|Arcing horns form a {{spark gap}} across the {{insulator}} {{with a lower}} breakdown voltage than the air path along the insulator surface, so an overvoltage will cause the air to break down and the arc to form between the arcing horns, diverting {{it away from the}} surface of the insulator. An arc between the horns is more tolerable for the equipment, providing more time for the fault to be detected and the arc to be safely cleared by remote circuit breakers. The geometry of some designs encourages the arc to migrate away from the insulator, driven by rising currents as it heats the surrounding air. As it does so, the path length increases, cooling the arc, reducing the electric field and causing the arc to extinguish itself when it can no longer span the gap. Other designs can utilise the magnetic field produced by the high current to drive the arc away from the insulator. This type of arrangement can be known as a <b>magnetic</b> <b>blowout.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Probably {{the first}} people to observe an effect due to an {{electrical}} oscillator were Auguste Arthur de la Rive, who observed a hissing arc in 1846, and David Edward Hughes, who observed the humming telephone effect in 1878. Although in 1880 the French engineer Jean-Marie-Anatole Gérard-Lescuyer observed oscillations in a DC powered coupled dynamo-motor system, the first practical oscillators were based on electric arcs, which were used for lighting in the 19th century. Ernst Lecher in 1888 showed that the current through an electric arc could be oscillatory. An oscillator was built by Elihu Thomson in 1892 by placing an LC tuned circuit in parallel with an electric arc and included a <b>magnetic</b> <b>blowout.</b> Independently, in the same year, George Francis Fitzgerald realized that if the damping resistance in a resonant circuit could be made zero or negative, the circuit would produce oscillations, and, unsuccessfully, tried to build a negative resistance oscillator with a dynamo, what would now be called a parametric oscillator. The arc oscillator was rediscovered and popularized by William Duddell in 1900. The current through an arc light is unstable and often produces hissing, humming or howling sounds. Duddell, a student at London Technical College, investigated this effect. He attached an LC circuit to the electrodes of an arc lamp, and the LC circuit tuned the frequency of the sound. Some of the energy was radiated as sound waves by the arc, producing a musical tone. Duddell demonstrated his oscillator before the London Institute of Electrical Engineers by sequentially connecting different tuned circuits across the arc to play the national anthem [...] "God Save the Queen". Duddell's [...] "singing arc" [...] did not generate frequencies above the audio range. In 1902 Danish physicists Valdemar Poulsen and P. O. Pederson were able to increase the frequency produced into the radio range, inventing the Poulsen arc radio transmitter, the first continuous wave radio transmitter, which was used through the 1920s.|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} arc rupturing parts of {{low-voltage}} air circuit breakers {{depends upon the}} strength and distribution of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>blowout</b> field by which the arc is forced. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>blowout</b> causes the arc {{to move into a}} set of slotted iron grids, where the arc is extinguished rapidly. The current in the conductors and the arc make up a magnetic field through the grids around the arc. Thus, {{the first step in the}} calculation of the motion of the arc is the prediction of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>blowout</b> force. In many cases, however, it was not easy to calculate the forces owing to the complicated three dimensional structure of arc chutes and contact systems. In this paper, a developed method which can calculate the distribution of <b>magnetic</b> <b>blowout</b> forces along arc which lie at arc rupturing Parts 　of a circuit breakers is described. The forces are calculated in the same way that a conductor is moved in the magnetic field. The flux density in the arc is obtained by 2 -D or 3 -D finite element method taking into account magnetic saturation of iron plates. And then, the differences between 2 -D and 3 -D finite element method are discussed by calculated results of the model...|$|E
