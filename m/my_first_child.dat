60|$|<b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>child</b> {{was born}} on December 27th, 1839, and I at once {{commenced}} to make notes on the first dawn of the various expressions which he exhibited, for I felt convinced, even at this early period, that the most complex and fine shades of expression must all have had a gradual and natural origin. During the summer of the following year, 1840, I read Sir C. Bell's admirable work on expression, and this greatly increased the interest which I felt in the subject, though I could not at all agree with his belief that various muscles had been specially created {{for the sake of}} expression. From this time forward I occasionally attended to the subject, both with respect to man and our domesticated animals. My book sold largely; 5267 copies having been disposed of on the day of publication.|$|E

'If your wife's first child {{turns out to be a}} son,' he said, 'there is an heir to the title and estates, and I may go on as I am now.' We were married a month afterward--and when <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>child</b> was born it was a girl. I leave you to judge what the disappointment was! My lord (persuaded, as I suspect, by the woman I mentioned just now) ran the risk of waiting another year, and a year afterward, rather than be married. Through all that time, I had no other child or prospect of a child. His lordship was fairly driven into taking a wife. Ah, how I hate her! Their first child was a boy--a big, bouncing, healthy brute of a boy! And six months afterward, my poor little fellow was born. Only think of it! And tell me, Jemmy, don't I deserve to be a happy woman, after suffering such a dreadful disappointment as that? Is it true that you're going back to America?" ...|$|E
60|$|Next day I {{came back}} again. The strange bird {{was there on}} her nest as before, her long bill resting {{over the edge of}} the hollow and looking like a twig at the first glance. She showed no fear whatever, and {{encouraged}} at her quietness and assurance I crept nearer and nearer till I touched her bill with my finger and turned it gently aside. At this she wiggled it impatiently, and <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>child's</b> observation was one that has only recently been noticed by naturalists, namely, that the tip of the upper bill is flexible and can be moved about almost like the tip of a finger in order to find the food that lies deep in the mud, and seize it and drag it out of its hiding. At the same time she uttered a curious hissing sound that frightened me again and made me think of snakes and hidden stings; so I drew back and watched her from a safe distance. She sat for the most part perfectly motionless, the only movement being an occasional turning of the long bill; and once when she had been still a very long time, I turned her head aside again, and to my astonishment and delight she made no objection, but left her head as I had turned it, and presently she let me twist it back again. After her first warning she seemed to understand the situation perfectly, and had no concern for the wondering child that watched her and that had no intention whatever of harming her or her nest.|$|R

In 1845, I took much pains in correcting a new edition of my 'Journal of Researches,' which was originally published in 1839 as part of Fitz-Roy's work. The success of this, <b>my</b> <b>first</b> literary <b>child,</b> always tickles my vanity more than that of any of my other books. Even to this day it sells steadily in England and the United States, and has been translated for the second time into German, and into French and other languages. This success of a book of travels, especially of a scientific one, so many years after its first publication, is surprising. Ten thousand copies have been sold in England of the second edition. In 1846 my 'Geological Observations on South America' were published. I record in a little diary, which I have always kept, that my three geological books ('Coral Reefs' included) consumed four and a half years' steady work; [...] "and now it is ten years since my return to England. How much time have I lost by illness?" [...] I have nothing to say about these three books except that to my surprise new editions have lately been called for.

40|$|The {{following}} contributions came {{in response}} to a request, sent to a number of key figures in feminism today, to write on a text that had been formative for their thinking as feminists.

As we hoped, this project has created a selection of texts central to our many and different experiences as feminists.

Foreword from Maggie Barry The provision of maternity services {{is a subject}} close to my heart. Like many other key life experiences nothing can prepare you for the reality of actually having a baby. It wasn’t until I became pregnant with <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>child</b> Joseph in 1997 that I realised {{there was much more}} to having a child than the physical and emotional rigors. The politics of health are not exactly user-friendly, especially to the first-time mother and the initial hurdle of selecting the person who would look after me through the pregnancy and birth was not a straightforward process. Clear and unbiased information on which to make an informed decision was not easy to come by. Ultimately it worked out well for my son and me, but from talking to other women I became aware that access to the Lead Maternity Carer (LMC) of choice was more a myth than a reality for some. When I was asked {{as a member of the}} National Health Committee (NHC) to chair the review of maternity services I was enthusiastic about the project because I believed it was time women ha...|$|E
40|$|This past year, two life-altering events {{descended on}} my life {{within a few months}} of each other: the death of my sister from cancer, and the birth of <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>child.</b> Both were anticipated, but hit me with a kind of {{emotional}} power that I couldn’t have imagined until they actually happened. The extremes of the highs and lows these events brought induced a mental whiplash as I thought about what they meant, and how they would affect my family and me. Grief and celebration seldom inhabit the same place at once, but I found my-self living shoulder to shoulder with them both. I was feeling these emotions in all their intensity and poignancy, and simultaneously trying to place them all into rational categories that would help me make sense of a life that had ended, and a new one that had just begun. My book entitled 197 _ Is a metaphorical visualization of my struggle to reconcile the heartache of my sister’s loss, the awe and wonder of meeting my daughter, the ache of living thousands of miles away from her, as well as the tension between the way these experiences felt to me, and what some of the philosophies I had studied told me they really meant. Through a sometimes discordant mix of cinematic images, personal vernacular photographs, and collage, I attempt to show my viewers what this struggle feels like, and in the sequence and structure of the book, I allow the viewer to participate in my search for meaning...|$|E
