The literature search summarizes basic knowledge on the subject and presents classical tools of financial analysis and tools applicable primarily to the insurance sector. Part of the literature search is a chapter devoted to the indicators evaluating the insurance <b>market</b> <b>level.</b> In {{the introduction of the}} empirical part is outlined the development of the insurance market and the development of insurance <b>market</b> <b>level</b> <b>indicators</b> in the Czech Republic between 2007 and 2012. Subsequently is performed a financial performance analysis of insurance companies during the reporting period using the methods {{selected on the basis of}} a literature search. Monitored are the performance and ratio indicators. In case of financial analysis of life insurance company is performed a spider analysis and a calculation of its embedded value. The results are interpreted and compared with the results of competing insurance companies and with results in the insurance sector. The thesis concludes with recommendations designed to improve the competitiveness of the analyzed insurance companies...|$|R

Since the nineties we can observe the growth of regional disparities of housing prices. It has a direct influence on the creation and increase of regional disparities in housing affordability. The Bachelor thesis describes some of the methods of measuring the affordability of housing in the Czech Republic. The main objective is to determine whether housing prices reflect the labor market. By using correlation analysis we are able to demonstrate a statistically significant effect of selected labor <b>market</b> <b>indicators</b> (<b>level</b> of monthly gross wages and the share of unemployed persons) on purchase housing prices.

The degree of development of non-bank financial institutions is presented through {{the context of their}} influence on the economic growth of Ukraine, and is based on appropriate foreign experience. Moreover, it is presented a methodical approach of determining the integration of non-bank financial services market into the world financial space on the basis of analysis of the level of openness and development of the domestic economy as a whole and the market of non-bank financial services in comparison with other countries of the world. It is made a comparison of the Ukrainian non-bank financial services <b>market</b> general <b>level</b> with <b>indicators</b> of development of this sector in other countries of the world. Furthermore, it is determined the share of foreign capital in the domestic market of non-bank financial services of Ukraine that allows to determine the effectiveness of the changes that it brings to the domestic financial services market. Finally, it is compared volumes of mutual use of foreign capital in the activities of the Ukrainian non-bank financial services market and domestic capital in the activities of foreign non-bank financial institutions...|$|R

40|$|Introduction One of {{the main}} targets of planners, {{decision}} makers and governments is increasing society health with promotion and production of suitable and healthy food. One of the basic commodities that have important role in satisfaction of required human food is milk. So, some part of government and producer healthy budget allocate to milk consumption promotion by using generic advertising. If effectiveness of advertising budget on profitability is more, producer will have more willing to spend for advertising. Determination of optimal generic advertising budget is one of important problem in managerial decision making in producing firm as well as increase in consumption and profit and decrease in wasting and non-optimality of budget. Materials and Methods: In this study, optimal generic advertising budget intensity index (advertising budget share of production cost) was estimated under two different scenarios by using equilibrium replacement model. In equilibrium replacement model, producer surplus are maximized in respect to generic advertising in retail <b>level.</b> According to <b>market</b> where two <b>levels</b> of farm and processing before retail exist and there is trade in farm and retail level, we present different models. Fixed and variable proportion hypothesis is another one. Finally, eight relations are presented for determination of milk generic advertising optimum budget. So, we use data from several resources such as previous studies, national (Iran Static center) and international institute (Fao) formal data and own estimation. Because there are several estimations in previous studies, we identify some scenarios (in two general scenarios) for calculation of milk generic advertising optimum budget. Results and Discussion: Estimation of milk generic advertising optimum budget in scenario 1 shows that in case of one <b>market</b> <b>level,</b> fixed supplies and no trade, optimum budget is 0. 4672539 percent. In case of one <b>market</b> <b>level</b> and no trade, optimum budget is 0. 3674844 percent. In case of one <b>market</b> <b>level</b> with trade, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of farm input, changed from 0. 3675013 to 0. 3674941 percent. In case of two <b>market</b> <b>level</b> and no trade at either <b>market</b> <b>levels,</b> optimum budget is 0. 5094457 percent. In case of two <b>market</b> <b>levels</b> with trade only at retail, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of retail goods are changed from 0. 509446 to 0. 3674844 percent. In case of two <b>market</b> <b>levels</b> with trade only at farm, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of farm input are changed from 0. 5094600 to 0. 5094951 percent. In case of two <b>market</b> <b>levels</b> with trade at both retail and farm, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of retail goods and farm input are changed from 0. 5085780 to 0. 5117381 percent. This index in variable proportion hypothesis will be changed from 0. 4143826 to 0. 4164392. Estimation of milk generic advertising optimum budget in scenario 2 shows that in case of one <b>market</b> <b>level,</b> fixed supplies and no trade, optimum budget is 9. 639368 percent. In case of one <b>market</b> <b>level</b> and no trade, optimum budget 8. 9480986 percent. In case of one <b>market</b> <b>level</b> with trade, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of farm input, changed from 8. 948178 to 8. 948440 percent. In case of two <b>market</b> <b>level</b> and no trade at either <b>market</b> <b>levels,</b> optimum budget is 14. 4113143 percent. In case of two <b>market</b> <b>levels</b> with trade only at retail, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of retail goods are changed from 14. 413087 to 14. 447182 percent. In case of two <b>market</b> <b>levels</b> with trade only at farm, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of farm input are changed from 14. 413301 to 14. 413689 percent. In case of two <b>market</b> <b>levels</b> with trade at both retail and farm, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of retail goods and farm input are changed from 14. 379081 to 14. 413792 percent. This index in variable proportion hypothesis will be changed from 13. 294219 to 13. 323525. Finally, Results indicate that milk generic advertising budget intensity index will be changed from 0. 3674844 to 14. 4474182 percent with mean of 0. 4617576 percent for scenario 1 and 13. 445766 percent for scenario 2. Conclusion: According to the results, we proposed that milk producer should spend 13. 44 percent of their production cost to generic advertising. This spending can increase milk consumption and it increase health society. Moreover, it decreases the household care and remedy spending and it increases the profitability of milk production firms. Also, government could spend to milk generic advertising from healthy budget of ministry of medical health, care and education or from agricultural promotion budget of ministry of Agri-Jahad...|$|R
