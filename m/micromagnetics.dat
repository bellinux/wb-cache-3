50|$|The {{interaction}} of <b>micromagnetics</b> with mechanics is also {{of interest in}} the context of industrial applications that deal with magneto-acoustic resonance such as in hypersound speakers, high frequency magnetostrictive transducers etc. FEM simulations taking into account the effect of magnetostriction into <b>micromagnetics</b> are of importance. Such simulations use models described above within a finite element framework.|$|E
50|$|<b>Micromagnetics</b> {{as a field}} (i.e., {{that deals}} {{specifically}} with the behaviour of (ferro)magnetic materials at sub-micrometer length scales) was introduced in 1963 when William Fuller Brown, Jr. published a paper on antiparallel domain wall structures. Until comparatively recently computational <b>micromagnetics</b> has been prohibitively expensive in terms of computational power, but smaller problems are now solvable on a modern desktop PC.|$|E

50|$|<b>Micromagnetics</b> is a {{field of}} physics dealing with the {{prediction}} of magnetic behaviors at sub-micrometer length scales. The length scales considered are large enough for the atomic structure of the material to be ignored (the continuum approximation), yet small enough to resolve magnetic structures such as domain walls or vortices.|$|E
50|$|His {{research}} interests include partial differential equations in physics (liquid crystals, Bose-Einstein condensates, <b>micromagnetics,</b> Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity, gauge theory) and differential geometry (harmonic maps between manifolds, geometric flows, minimal surfaces, the Willmore functional and Yang-Mills fields). His work focuses in particular on non-linear phenomena, formation of vortices, energy quantization and regularity issues.|$|E

50|$|Nicholas Halloway is a 34-year-old Manhattan {{securities}} {{analyst who}} writes a narrative memoir (presumably this book) {{of his life}} starting {{on the day of}} an accident which renders him invisible. He recounts his involvement in a romantic affair with Anne Epstein, a woman who has taken interest in his aptitude for business and {{is a reporter for the}} Times. He escorts her to <b>MicroMagnetics</b> where scientists are holding a press conference for research on the magnetic containment of a nuclear process. While there, Nick sees a group of Marxist student protesters who demonstrate nuclear catastrophe by attempting to explode a cat. To get everyone away from the <b>MicroMagnetics</b> presentation, they cut off power to the laboratory where nuclear equipment is operating. The control computers lose function and in a flash of eerie light, everything in a fifty-foot radius becomes invisible, including Nick.|$|E
50|$|The {{various forms}} of the {{equation}} are commonly used in <b>micromagnetics</b> to model {{the effects of a}} magnetic field on ferromagnetic materials. In particular {{it can be used to}} model the time domain behavior of magnetic elements due to a magnetic field. An additional term was added to the equation to describe the effect of spin polarized current on magnets.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} dynamic <b>micromagnetics</b> is {{to predict the}} time {{evolution}} of the magnetic configuration of a sample subject to some non-steady conditions such as {{the application of a}} field pulse or an AC field. This is done by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, which is a partial differential equation describing the evolution of the magnetization in term of the local effective field acting on it.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} static <b>micromagnetics</b> is to solve for the spatial {{distribution}} of the magnetization M at equilibrium. In most cases, as the temperature is {{much lower than the}} Curie temperature of the material considered, the modulus |M| of the magnetization is assumed to be everywhere equal to the saturation magnetization Ms. The problem then consists in finding the spatial orientation of the magnetization, which is given by the magnetization direction vector m = M/Ms, also called reduced magnetization.|$|E
50|$|In 1938 Brown was {{appointed}} {{assistant professor of}} physics at Princeton University. It was during this period that he developed <b>micromagnetics.</b> In 1941, he went to the U.S. Naval Ordnance Laboratory, where he headed a team that was working on methods to protect ships against magnetic mines. He developed novel methods for degaussing ships and instrumentation for measuring magnetic fields and the magnetic properties of steels. For his work he was awarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award by the U.S. Navy.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{descriptions}} {{include the}} notion of topology-a categorization of shapes {{and the way in}} which an object is laid out in space-using a continuous-field approximation as defined in <b>micromagnetics.</b> Descriptions generally specify a non-zero, integer value of the topological index, (not to be confused with the chemistry meaning of 'topological index'). This value is sometimes also referred to as the winding number, the topological charge (although it is unrelated to 'charge' in the electrical sense), the topological quantum number (although it is unrelated to quantum mechanics or quantum mechanical phenomena, notwithstanding the quantization of the index values), or more loosely as the “skyrmion number.” The topological index of the field can be described mathematically as ...|$|E
5000|$|Magnetostatics is {{the study}} of {{magnetic}} fields in systems where the currents are steady (not changing with time). It is the magnetic analogue of electrostatics, where the charges are stationary. The magnetization need not be static; the equations of magnetostatics can be used to predict fast magnetic switching events that occur on time scales of nanoseconds or less. Magnetostatics is even a good approximation when the currents are not static [...] - [...] as long as the currents do not alternate rapidly. Magnetostatics is widely used in applications of <b>micromagnetics</b> such as models of magnetic recording devices. Magnetostatic focussing can be achieved either by a permanent magnet or by passing current through a coil of wire whose axis coincides with the beam axis.|$|E
50|$|A stable domain {{structure}} is a magnetization function M(x), {{considered as a}} continuous vector field, which minimizes the total energy E throughout the material. To find the minimums a variational method is used, resulting {{in a set of}} nonlinear differential equations, called Brown's equations after William Fuller Brown Jr. Although in principle these equations can be solved for the stable domain configurations M(x), in practice only the simplest examples can be solved. Analytic solutions do not exist, and numerical solutions calculated by the finite element method are computationally intractable because of the large difference in scale between the domain size and the wall size. Therefore, <b>micromagnetics</b> has evolved approximate methods which assume that the magnetization of dipoles in the bulk of the domain, away from the wall, all point in the same direction, and numerical solutions are only used near the domain wall, where the magnetization is changing rapidly.|$|E
50|$|A {{magnetic}} domain is a region within a magnetic material {{in which the}} magnetization is in a uniform direction. This means that the individual magnetic moments of the atoms are aligned {{with one another and}} they point in the same direction. When cooled below a temperature called the Curie temperature,the magnetization of a piece of ferromagnetic material spontaneously divides into many small regions called {{magnetic domain}}s. The magnetization within each domain points in a uniform direction, but the magnetization of different domains may point in different directions. Magnetic domain structure is responsible for the magnetic behavior of ferromagnetic materials like iron, nickel, cobalt and their alloys, and ferrimagnetic materials like ferrite. This includes the formation of permanent magnets and the attraction of ferromagnetic materials to a magnetic field. The regions separating magnetic domains are called domain walls, where the magnetization rotates coherently from the direction in one domain to that in the next domain. The study of magnetic domains is called <b>micromagnetics.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Experimentally, it is {{observed}} that though the magnitude of the magnetization is uniform throughout a homogeneous specimen at uniform temperature, the direction of the magnetization is in general not uniform, but varies from one region to another, on a scale corresponding to visual observations with a microscope. Uniform of direction is attained only by applying a field, or by choosing as a specimen, a body which is itself of microscopic dimensions (a fine particle). The size range for which a ferromagnet become single-domain is generally quite narrow and a first quantitative result in this direction is due to William Fuller Brown, Jr. who, in his fundamental paper, rigorously proved (in the framework of <b>Micromagnetics),</b> though in the special case of a homogeneous sphere of radius , what nowadays is known as Brown’s fundamental theorem of the theory of fine ferromagnetic particles. This theorem states the existence of a critical radius [...] such that the state of lowest free energy is one of uniform magnetization if [...] (i.e. the existence of a critical size under which spherical ferromagnetic particles stay uniformly magnetized in zero applied field). A lower bound for [...] can then be computed. In 1988, Amikam A. Aharoni, by using the same mathematical reasoning as Brown, was able to extend the Fundamental Theorem to the case of a prolate spheroid. Recently, Brown’s fundamental theorem on fine ferromagnetic particles has been rigorously extended to the case of a general ellipsoid, and an estimate for the critical diameter (under which the ellipsoidal particle become single domain) has been given in terms of the demagnetizing factors of the general ellipsoid. Eventually, the same result {{has been shown to be}} true for metastable equilibria in small ellipsoidal particles.|$|E

40|$|Using {{the time}} {{evolution}} of the dynamic magnetization, we study the frequencies of spin excitations in small ferromagnetic bars with {{particular attention to the}} uniform mode. The calculation is done using <b>micromagnetics,</b> and the frequency of various modes is found {{as a function of the}} cell size used in the calculation. We find that the uniform mode and some standing spin-wave modes are relatively insensitive to changes in the cell size. In contrast, edge modes and corner modes show significant frequency changes as the cell size is changed in the <b>micromagnetics</b> calculation. These results justify the use of <b>micromagnetics</b> with larger cells to estimate the frequency of the uniform mode of micronsized magnetic bars.
