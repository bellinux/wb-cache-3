Zavistonovičius held a gun for hunting since 1975. The permits were periodically renewed. As part of the renewal process, Zavistonovičius had to pass an examination by a psychiatrist. None of the psychiatrists who examined Zavistonovičius noticed anything suspicious, a fact which caused much controversy. During the investigation it was uncovered that in 1985, Zavistonovičius had been referred to and examined by the Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital. Zavistonovičius was married three times. The third wife separated from him just ten months before the shooting and described his <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> and persecutory delusions, even though neighbors saw him as an intelligent and helpful man. Relatives had begun noticing various symptoms since 1978, which may have been related to a car crash in 1976. In light of these findings, the prosecutor's office explored a possibility of charging with negligence the seven doctors who signed off on Zavistonovičius' gun permit. However, it was determined that the doctors were not negligent: without a centralized database, they could not know that Zavistonovičius was treated at a psychiatric hospital, and in public his symptoms were masked and controlled well enough to pass the brief examination without suspicion.|$|E

40|$|Jealousy is {{not only}} a way of {{experiencing}} love but also a stabilizer of romantic relationships, although <b>morbid</b> romantic <b>jealousy</b> is maladaptive. Being engaged in a formal romantic relationship can tune one’s romantic jealousy towards a specific target. Little is known about how the human brain processes romantic jealousy by now. Here, by combining scenario-based imagination and functional MRI, we investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of romantic jealousy and their development across stages (before vs. after being in a formal relationship). Romantic jealousy scenarios elicited activations primarily in the basal ganglia (BG) across stages, and were significantly higher after the relationship was established in both the behavioral rating and BG activation. The intensity of romantic jealousy was related to the intensity of romantic happiness, which mainly correlated with ventral medial prefrontal cortex activation. The increase in jealousy across stages was associated with the tendency for interpersonal aggression. These results bridge the gap between the theoretical conceptualization of romantic jealousy and its neural correlates and shed light on the dynamic changes in jealousy...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{psychological}} causes {{that go along}} with <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy.</b> Some people equate <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> with a delusional state. “Delusions of infidelity exist without any other psychopathology and may be considered to be <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> in its ‘purest’ form” (Kingham and Gordon). For <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> to occur one’s memories are subconsciously changed and their partner’s actions are misinterpreted as well {{to the extent that the}} person is absolutely convinced of betrayal from the partner. It is thought that even some brain disorders might eventually lead to delusions of betrayal. It has also been recorded by Cobb (1979) “that <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> may be present with all types of cerebral insult or injury.” [...] "It has been suggested that <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> may potentially arise in response to reduced sexual function”. Cobb (1979) drew attention to the elderly man whose waning sexual powers were insufficient to satisfy a younger wife.|$|E

50|$|<b>Morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> (also {{known as}} Othello {{syndrome}} or delusional jealousy) {{is an example}} of the suspicious version of this disorder where a person is preoccupied with the thought that their spouse or sexual partner is being unfaithful without having any real proof, along with socially unacceptable or abnormal behaviour related to these thoughts. The most common cited forms of psychopathology in <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> are delusions and obsessions. It is considered a subtype of delusional disorder.|$|E
50|$|Men {{and women}} differ {{dramatically}} {{when it comes}} to <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy.</b> Men who suffer from <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> are more likely than women to use violence and also are more likely to harm or kill with their hands rather than a blunt object. Women on the other hand, when using violence, tend to use a blunt object or knife. Men focus on the rival’s status and resources {{when it comes to}} the threat of jealousy they fear. Women tend to become more jealous of a potential threat on their rival’s youth and physical attractiveness.|$|E
50|$|For men {{the strongest}} trigger is sexual {{infidelity}} and with women the strongest trigger is emotional infidelity.

50|$|Obsessions: the individual's own {{thoughts}} are egodystonic; they are acknowledged to be senseless, and usually resisted. Jealous thoughts are experienced as intrusive and excessive, and compulsive behavior such as {{checking up on}} their partner may follow. Egodystonicity (the distress caused by thoughts that are unwanted and viewed as contrary to conscious wishes) generally varies a large amount between patients and “a continuum from obsessional to delusional, which <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> has been suggested” (Insel & Akiskal 1986).|$|E
50|$|Many esteemed psychiatrists {{worked under}} the {{direction}} of Lewis at the Institute of Psychiatry, including Martin Roth and Michael Shepherd; the latter was at great pains to point out that Lewis's impact also extended to his contributions as a clinician, scholar and researcher, particularly in the field of epidemiology, but also genetics, clinical phenomenology and biology.

50|$|Delusions: the individual's own {{thoughts}} are egosyntonic; they {{are regarded as}} true, and not resisted. Some authors compare <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> to a delusional state (e.g. Enoch & Trethowan, 1979). Beliefs may include the morbidly jealous subjects' suspicion that 1. {{he or she is}} being poisoned or given some substance(s) to decrease sexual potency by the partner, 2. that the partner has contracted a sexually transmitted disease from a third party 3. is engaging in sexual intercourse with a third party while the subject sleeps.|$|E

It is not out of the question for a child to witness a homicide or suicide where their parent is the victim.|$|E
5000|$|It {{can take}} several forms in behaviour: {{aggression}} and violence, and possessiveness or controlling behaviour towards their mate.

[...] <b>Morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> is also concurrent with male sexual jealousy - an obsession with thoughts of a partner's suspected sexual infidelity. A recent meta-analysis reviewed the literature and found that sexual jealousy in males can also lead to emotions such as distress, hurt and disgust being experienced.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> {{encompasses}} various psychiatric {{states and}} the best way to approach treatment depends on the symptoms that are observed in the individual. Therefore, prognosis and outcomes vary from person to person and depends on the situation and the complexities of the interpersonal relationships being observed. Also, other issues that may exacerbate the negative aspects of the environment created by jealous behavior need to be addressed in order to begin reparations. For example, if alcoholism plays a role in the behavior of the morbidly jealous individual, treatment of their addiction can positively affect their progress in trying to change their jealous nature. While psychotherapy can be an effective method of treating morbidly jealous persons, it is not sufficient when the nature of their illness is more serious. It is not possible to say that there is one form of treatment that is superior over all those that are currently available. [...] Even though this may be true, cognitive behavioral therapy is the treatment that has proven to be most effective.|$|E

50|$|In {{an attempt}} to counsel or treat the <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> of an individual, proper and {{thorough}} assessment must be employed. This approach is broad in nature, but necessary so as to provide adequate information that will aid in the possible reparation of a dynamic containing a morbidly jealous person. To begin, a careful history should be taken of both partners if possible; separate and together. It is imperative that a full and detailed psychiatric history and mental state examination be recorded for the jealous partner; doing so may enable one to distinguish whether the jealousy is obsessional or delusional in nature. It {{is also possible that}} the jealousy {{may be the result of}} a thought that has been given too much importance. Considering that jealousy is a very delicate issue, any reference made to it should be approached carefully and with tact. It must be kept in mind that the jealous individual may be displacing blame for their issues onto their partner and their alleged infidelity as opposed to their own behavior. If there is any history of relevant or related mental illness and substance misuse it should be noted as it may possibly be a contributing or aiding factor. In order to get the best grasp on the issues and begin positive progression, multiple interviews should be held to assess the marital relationship.|$|E
5000|$|Violence {{can occur}} in any {{relationship}} tainted with jealousy, either normal or <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy.</b> In {{a recent study of}} jealousy by Mullen & Martin in 1994, 15% of both men and women reported that at some time they had been “subjected to physical violence {{at the hands of a}} jealous partner.” Culturally, jealousy may be even used to “justify violence towards partners.” Victims in a homicide case are most likely to be current or ex-partners, in both female and male perpetrators.When a partner repeatedly denies infidelity this may provoke anger and extreme violence. On the other hand, the partner that is suffering may give up and give a false confession, which in turn most likely will provoke rage in the jealous individual. In the US a sample was taken of 20 participants with delusional jealousy. 19 were male and Silva (1998) found that 13 had threatened to kill their spouse because of their perceived infidelity. Of the 13 males, 9 actually attacked their spouse. Out of the 20, a weapon was used by 3 of them, and 12 had harmed their spouse. [...] A presence of paranoid delusions and hallucinations of injury to the spouse were most often associated with violence. This suggests that individuals that suffer from delusional jealousy that partake in violence may be solely driven by psychotic phenomena. A higher risk of assault was associated with alcohol consumption.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that individuals diagnosed with <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> have jealousy mechanisms that are activated at lower thresholds than individuals with normal jealousy, but that these mechanisms produce behavior {{that is similar to}} individuals with normal jealousy. We extended previous research documenting these similarities by investigating sex differences in partner-directed violence committed by individuals diagnosed with <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy.</b> The results support some of our predictions. For example, a greater percentage of men than women diagnosed with <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> used physical violence, attempted to kill, and actually killed their partners, and used their hands rather than an object to kill their partners. These results replicate results generated for individuals with normal jealousy.

40|$|Background: Jealousy in {{a sexual}} {{relation}} has some advantage that it ensures propagation of one’s own gene as put by evolutionary psychologists. However, if this belief is based on unfounded evidence it may impair the relationship between partners and may be extremely distressful. <b>Morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> may present as obsession, overvalued idea, or delusion {{as one of the}} symptoms in different psychiatric disorders. Aim: The aim {{of the study was to}} find the frequency of patients with <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> presenting in the Department of Psychiatry of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), the psychiatric diagnoses of such patients, frequency of different forms of <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> (obsession, overvalued idea, and delusion). Also, to assess predisposing or triggering factors for jealousy and to assess for suicidality in such patients and their partners. Materials and methods: All patients attending the Department of Psychiatry, PMCH were administered a screening questionnaire and if they qualified they were further administered the operational criteria for <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy.</b> The psychiatric diagnosis was confirmed with the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems: Diagnostic Criteria for Research (ICD- 10 : DCR). Each patient was then administered a rating scale to quantify the psychopathology. Results: Out of 970 patients who attended outpatient department, 658 patients were administered the screening questionnaire, 174 qualified who were later assessed with the operational criteria for <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy.</b> Fifty patients who fulfilled the criteria were assessed. The mean age of presentation for both sexes were 36. 44 year (SD= 13. 12 years). <b>Morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> was found to be twice as common in males as compared in females. Highest prevalence was found among participants who had higher secondary education, belonged to middle socioeconomic status, and having psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia followed by depression. Delusional jealousy was the commonest followed by overvalued idea and obsession. A total of 20 % of patients reported substance abuse like alcohol, cannabis, nicotine etc. either currently or in the past. Triggering factors found were spouse working away from home, interaction with opposite sex, attractiveness as perceived by the person with <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy.</b> Females either as patients of <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> or as partners of a morbidly jealous spouse, carried the higher risk of suicide as compared to males...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{evidence}} {{base for}} the treatment of <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> with integrative therapies is thin. This study explored the efficacy of cognitive analytic therapy (CAT). DESIGN: An adjudicated hermeneutic single-case efficacy design evaluated the cognitive analytic treatment of a patient meeting diagnostic criteria for obsessive <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy.</b> METHOD: A rich case record was developed using a matrix of nomothetic and ideographic quantitative and qualitative outcomes. This record was then debated by sceptic and affirmative research teams. Experienced psychotherapy researchers acted as judges, assessed the original case record, and heard the affirmative-versus-sceptic debate. Judges pronounced an opinion regarding the efficacy of the therapy. RESULTS: The efficacy of CAT was supported by all three judges. Each ruled that change had occurred due to the action of the therapy, beyond any level of reasonable doubt. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrates the potential usefulness of CAT in treating <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> and suggests that CAT is conceptually well suited. Suggestions for future clinical and research directions are provided. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The relational approach of CAT makes it a suitable therapy for <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy.</b> The narrative reformulation component of CAT appears to facilitate early change in chronic jealousy patterns. It is helpful for therapists during sessions to use CAT theory to diagrammatically spell out the patterns maintaining jealousy...|$|E

40|$|In our experience, {{delusional}} {{disorders are}} common in forensic settings, an experience probably shared by other psychiatrists. <b>Morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> is a common symptom in delusional disorders. Although there are few references in the literature, we have noticed an association between stalking behaviour and <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy.</b> Shepherd describes jealousy as a notoriously dangerous passion that constitutes a well-recognised motive for crimes of violence. By convention, ‘morbid jealousy ’ refers to a pathological state arising {{in the context of}} a conjugal relationship. But he considers ‘delusions of infidelity ’ a better description because it is infidelity that is suspected [1]. Shepherd states that <b>morbid</b> <b>jealousy</b> may arise in association with toxic and organic cerebral disorders, neurotic and personality disorders and functional psychoses. Until recently, ADHD was considered rare; 3 – 5 % of schoolchildren satisfy DSM-IV criteria and ICD- 10 gives a lower prevalence [2]. Estimates of prevalence in adults are based on inference from child data and the natural history of the disorder [3]. It is accepted that the disorder usually ceases by puberty, although it may persist, manifesting as anti-social behaviour and drug abuse [2]. Levy [4] described hyperactivity as one extreme of normal behaviour in children, casting doubt on the validity of ADHD as a ‘disorder’. In his recent review of the evidence in support of adult ADHD, Sachdev [5] concluded that ‘our use of the concept …should proceed with cautious scepticism lest our clinical zeal outpaces scientific credibility’.
