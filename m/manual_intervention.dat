25|$|The {{design of}} the modern positive-pressure {{ventilators}} were based mainly on technical developments by the military during World War II to supply oxygen to fighter pilots in high altitude. Such ventilators replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume/low-pressure cuffs were developed. The popularity of positive-pressure ventilators rose during the polio epidemic in the 1950s in Scandinavia and the United States and {{was the beginning of}} modern ventilation therapy. Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a tracheostomy tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such <b>manual</b> <b>intervention,</b> mechanical positive-pressure ventilators became increasingly popular.|$|E
40|$|Tracking of markers {{placed on}} {{anatomical}} landmarks {{is a common}} practice in sports science to perform the kinematic analysis that interests both athletes and coaches. Although different software programs {{have been developed to}} automatically track markers and/or features, none of them was specifically designed to analyze underwater motion. Hence, this study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a software developed for automatic tracking of underwater movements (DVP), based on the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi feature tracker. Twenty-one video recordings of different aquatic exercises (n = 2940 markers' positions) were manually tracked to determine the markers' center coordinates. Then, the videos were automatically tracked using DVP and a commercially available software (COM). Since tracking techniques may produce false targets, an operator was instructed to stop the automatic procedure and to correct the position of the cursor when the distance between the calculated marker's coordinate and the reference one was higher than 4 pixels. The proportion of <b>manual</b> <b>interventions</b> required by the software was used as a measure of the degree of automation. Overall, <b>manual</b> <b>interventions</b> were 10. 4 % lower for DVP (7. 4 %) than for COM (17. 8 %). Moreover, when examining the different exercise modes separately, the percentage of <b>manual</b> <b>interventions</b> was 5. 6 % to 29. 3 % lower for DVP than for COM. Similar results were observed when analyzing the type of marker rather than the type of exercise, with 9. 9 % less <b>manual</b> <b>interventions</b> for DVP than for COM. In conclusion, based on these results, the developed automatic tracking software presented can be used as a valid and useful tool for underwater motion analysis...|$|R

25|$|A key {{innovation}} {{required for}} the popularization of the BBS was the Hayes Smartmodem.

40|$|Abstract Study design Literature Review Objectives The {{objective}} of this literature review {{was to determine if}} postural sway changes in association with <b>manual</b> therapeutic <b>interventions</b> and to investigate whether any changes occur in healthy individuals or in association with pain intensity. Summary of Background data Improving postural stability has been proposed as a goal of <b>manual</b> therapeutic <b>interventions.</b> So far, no literature review has addressed whether there is supportive evidence for this and if so, what factors may be associated or causative for observed sway alterations. Search methods Seven online databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, ScienceDirect and the Cochrane library) were systematically searched followed by a manual search of the retrieved papers. Selection criteria Studies comparing postural sway derived from bipedal force plate measurements in association with a <b>manual</b> therapeutic <b>intervention,</b> ideally compared to a control group. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance, conducted the data extraction and the risk of bias assessment which was conducted using the RTI item bank. A descriptive analysis was conducted as the heterogeneous study designs prevented pooling of data. Results Nine studies of varying methodological quality met the inclusion criteria. No direct comparison of data across the studies was possible. There was no evidence that <b>manual</b> <b>interventions</b> lead to a change in postural sway in healthy individuals regardless of the body regions addressed by the intervention. There was some indication that postural sway may change at follow-up measurements in pain sufferers; however, {{this may be due to}} variations in pain intensity rather than resulting from the intervention itself. Conclusions There is no conclusive scientific evidence that <b>manual</b> therapeutic <b>interventions</b> may exhibit any immediate or long-term effect on COP excursions. Any changes in sway may be attributable to decreases in pain intensity. </p...|$|R
