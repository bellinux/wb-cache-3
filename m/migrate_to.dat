5|$|About 170 {{species of}} birds visit the park each year, {{including}} swifts and swallows. Most species <b>migrate</b> <b>to</b> warmer regions in winter, although jays, ravens, nuthatches, eagles, and owls stay. In winter, the mule deer, cougars, and coyotes <b>migrate</b> <b>to</b> lower elevations. Ground squirrels and marmots pass the winter in hibernation.|$|E

40|$|Normal {{human blood}} {{contains}} {{a population of}} neutrophils that <b>migrates</b> <b>to</b> various chemoattractants and a population that fails <b>to</b> <b>migrate.</b> The percentage of neutrophils <b>migrating</b> <b>to</b> optimal concentrations of chemoattractants was quantified: 20 <b>to</b> 40 % <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, 30 <b>to</b> 50 % <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> human C 5 a, 25 <b>to</b> 35 % <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> human leukocyte-derived chemotactic factors, 20 <b>to</b> 30 % <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> casein, 15 <b>to</b> 20 % <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> pepstatin, and 1 <b>to</b> 5 % <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> medium alone. Neutrophil migration to the most active chemoattractant was not increased when other chemoattractants were added, indicating that the population of neutrophils <b>migrating</b> <b>to</b> the most active attractant was the same population that was <b>migrating</b> <b>to</b> the other attractants. The percentage of neutrophils <b>migrating</b> <b>to</b> a chemoattractant was not altered by prolonging the assay incubation period or by replacing the attractant with new chemoattractant during the assay, and the percentage was independent of the neutrophil concentration added to the chemotaxis chamber. Nonmigrating neutrophils were isolated with a chemotaxis collection chamber, and they were examined for radiolabeled chemotactic peptide binding. The binding of radiolabeled N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine by nonmigrating and migrating neutrophils was identical...|$|R

5|$|In most cells, the {{disassembly}} of {{the nuclear}} envelope {{marks the end of}} the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes <b>migrate</b> <b>to</b> opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown {{of the nuclear}} envelope. The daughter chromosomes then <b>migrate</b> <b>to</b> opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.|$|E

5|$|Claims of {{intermediate}} mass {{black holes}} {{have been met}} with some skepticism. The heaviest objects in globular clusters are expected to <b>migrate</b> <b>to</b> the cluster center due to mass segregation.

5|$|Insect life-histories show {{adaptations to}} {{withstand}} cold and dry conditions.

5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various {{mangrove}} trees and maintain an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} year of their lives. As the Utila iguana cannot successfully lay its eggs in the mangrove swamps, the gravid females are forced to <b>migrate</b> <b>to</b> nearby sandy beaches in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can incubate in the hot sun. After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests and return to the mangroves. Sixty to seventy-four days later the hatchlings emerge and move back to the swamps.|$|E
5|$|Although {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} J.lagostoma are almost exclusively terrestrial, the larvae are marine and planktonic.

In {{most members of the}} family Gecarcinidae, migration coincides with the rainy season, which reduces the risk of desiccation; migration in J.lagostoma occurs from January until March, while the period of highest rainfall is from March to May.|$|E
