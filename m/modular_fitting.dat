5000|$|Skill training, in {{a manner}} similar to Eve Online, was also available. CCP has stated that it would take seven years to train all skills, and that it was not {{intended}} for any player to learn all of the skills. Instead, CCP believed that players would naturally become specialized by selecting a certain set of skills and becoming [...] "really, really good at them." [...] These skills unlocked new and better items, better passive bonuses, as well as unlocking other skills. Player-driven vehicles were also available in the game; these could be transported to anywhere within the battlefield using [...] "rapid deployment vehicles (RDV)" [...] at the request of players. Vehicles shared the <b>modular</b> <b>fitting</b> system that infantry dropsuits had but modules cost more than those of a dropsuit.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we combine two {{important}} {{ideas in the}} analysis of large-scale genomics experiments (e. g. experiments that aim to identify genes that are differentially expressed between two conditions). The first idea is use of Empirical Bayes (EB) methods to handle the large number of potentially-sparse effects, and estimate false discovery rates and related quantities. The second is use of factor analysis methods to deal with sources of unwanted variation such as batch effects and unmeasured confounders. We describe a simple <b>modular</b> <b>fitting</b> procedure that combines the key ideas from both these lines of research, and thus produce new and powerful EB methods for analyzing genomics experiments that can account for both large numbers of potentially-sparse effects and for sources of unwanted variation that can otherwise confound inference. In realistic simulations, these new methods provide significant gains in power and calibration over competing methods. In real data analysis we highlight that different methods, while often conceptually similar, can vary widely in their assessments of statistical significance, highlighting the need for care in both choice of methods and interpretation of results.

40|$|Abstract — The global {{fit of the}} Standard Model to electroweak {{precision}} data, routinely {{performed by}} the LEP electroweak working group and others, demonstrated impressively the predictive power of electroweak unification and quantum loop corrections. We have revisited this fit in view of (i) {{the development of the}} new generic fitting package, Gfitter, allowing flexible and efficient model testing in high-energy physics, (ii) the insertion of constraints from direct Higgs searches at LEP and the Tevatron, and (iii) a more thorough statistical interpretation of the results. Gfitter is a <b>modular</b> <b>fitting</b> toolkit, which features predictive theoretical models as independent plugins, and a statistical analysis of the fit results using toy Monte Carlo techniques. The state-of-the-art electroweak Standard Model is fully implemented, as well as generic extensions to it. Theoretical uncertainties are explicitly included in the fit through scale parameters varying within given error ranges. This paper introduces the Gfitter project, and presents state-of-the-art results for the global electroweak fit in the Standard Model (SM), and for a model with an extended Higgs sector (2 HDM). Numerical and graphical results for fits with and without including the constraints from the direct Higgs searches at LEP and Tevatron are given. Perspectives for future colliders are analysed and discussed. In the SM fit including the direct Higgs searches, we find MH = 116. 4 + 18. ...|$|E

Perspectives for future colliders are analysed and discussed. Including the direct Higgs searches, we find M_H=(116. 4 + 18. 3 - 1. 3) GeV, and the 2 sigma and 3 sigma allowed regions [114, 145] GeV and [[113, 168] and [180, 225]] GeV, respectively. For the strong coupling strength at fourth perturbative order we obtain alpha_S(M_Z) = 0. 1193 + 0. 0028 - 0. 0027 (exp) +- 0. 0001 (theo). Finally, for the mass of the top quark, excluding the direct measurements, we find m_t=(178. 2 + 9. 8 - 4. 2) GeV. In the 2 HDM we exclude a charged-Higgs mass below 240 GeV at 95 % confidence level. This limit increases towards larger tan(beta), where e. g., M_H+-< 780 GeV is excluded for tan(beta) = 70.

40|$|This work {{is mainly}} {{concerned}} {{with the notion of}} hierarchical modularity and its use in explaining structure and dynamical behavior of complex systems by means of hierarchical modular models, as well as with a concept of my proposal, antimodularity, tied to the possibility of the algorithmic detection of hierarchical modularity. Specifically, I highlight the pragmatic bearing of hierarchical modularity on the possibility of scientific explanation of complex systems, that is, systems which, according to a chosen basic description, can be considered as composed of elementary, discrete, interrelated parts. I stress that hierarchical modularity is also required by the experimentation aimed to discover the structure of such systems. Algorithmic detection of hierarchical modularity {{turns out to be a}} task plagued by the demonstrated computational intractability of the search for the best hierarchical modular description, and by high computational expensiveness of even approximated detection methods. Antimodularity consists in the lack of a <b>modular</b> description <b>fitting</b> the needs of the observer, due either to absence of modularity in the system's chosen basic description, or to the impossibility, due to the excessive size of the system under assessment in relation to the computational cost of algorithmic methods, to algorithmically produce a valid hierarchical description. I stress that modularity and antimodularity depend on the pragmatic choice of a given basic description of the system, a choice made by the observer based on explanatory goals. I show how antimodularity hinders the possibility of applying at least three well-known types of explanation: mechanistic, deductive-nomological and computational. A forth type, topological explanation, remains unaffected. I then assess the presence of modularity in biological systems, and evaluate the possible consequences, and the likeliness, of incurring in antimodularity in biology and neuroscience, concluding that this eventuality is quite likely, at least in systems biology. I finally indulge in some metaphysical and historical speculation: metaphysically, antimodularity seems to suggest a possible position according to which natural kinds are detected modules, and as such, due to computational hardness of the detection of the best hierarchical modular description, they are unlikely to be the best possible way to describe the world, because the modularity of natural kinds quite probably does not reflect the best possible modularity of the world. From an historical point of view, the growing use of computational methods for modularity detection or simulation of complex systems, especially in certain areas of scientific research, hints to the envisioning of a multiplicity of emerging scientific disciplines guided by a self-sustained, growing production of possibly human-unintelligible explanations. This, I suggest, would constitute an historical change in science, which, if has not already happened, could well be on the verge of happening. ...|$|R
40|$|P̅ANDA is {{a planned}} {{experiment}} at FAIR (Darmstadt) with a cooled antiproton beam {{in a range}} [1. 5; 15] GeV/c, allowing a wide physics program in nuclear and particle physics. It is the only experiment worldwide, which combines a solenoid field (B= 2 T) and a dipole field (B= 2 Tm) in a spectrometer with a fixed target topology, in that energy regime. The tracking system of P̅ANDA involves {{the presence of a}} high performance silicon vertex detector, a GEM detector, a straw-tubes central tracker, a forward tracking system, and a luminosity monitor. The offline tracking algorithm is developed within the PandaRoot framework, which {{is a part of the}} FairRoot project. The tool here presented is based on algorithms containing the Kalman Filter equations and a deterministic annealing filter. This general fitting tool (GENFIT 2) offers to users also a Runge-Kutta track representation, and interfaces with Millepede II (useful for alignment) and RAVE (vertex finder). It is independent on the detector geometry and the magnetic field map, and written in C++ object-oriented <b>modular</b> code. Several <b>fitting</b> algorithms are available with GENFIT 2, with user-adjustable parameters; therefore the tool is of friendly usage. A check on the fit convergence is done by GENFIT 2 as well. The Kalman-Filter-based algorithms have a wide range of applications; among those in particle physics they can perform extrapolations of track parameters and covariance matrices. The adoptions of the PandaRoot framework to connect to Genfit 2 are described, and the impact of GENFIT 2 on the physics simulations of P̅ANDA are shown: significant improvement is reported for those channels where a good low momentum tracking is required (pT < 400 MeV/c) ...|$|R
