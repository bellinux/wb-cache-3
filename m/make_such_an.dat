5|$|In the Senate, Stevenson was a {{conservative}} stalwart, steadfastly opposing spending on internal improvements {{and maintaining a}} strict constructionist view of the constitution. He urged his fellow senators to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1871, claiming that its provision that the president could suspend the right of habeas corpus in cases where he believed violence was imminent amounted to giving the chief executive the powers of a dictator. He also opposed the appropriation of federal money to fund the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{because he did not}} believe Congress was given the authority to <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> allocation under the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Neetu Chandra, {{who worked}} with Kumar on Yavarum Nalam (2009), made a cameo {{appearance}} in the film. Nagarjuna's sister Supriya told the media that a few other actors also made cameo appearances in the film. Rashi Khanna confirmed in early April 2014 that she too would <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> appearance. Kumar convinced Nagarjuna to let Akhil make a cameo appearance {{towards the end of}} the film or in a special song. However an official confirmation was originally unavailable. Amitabh Bachchan posted in his official blogging site on 27 April 2014 that he would make a quick cameo appearance in the film which would be his debut in Telugu cinema. Lavanya Tripathi also made a cameo appearance on Kumar's request. Akhil made a cameo towards the film's end, as he did not want to miss a chance of sharing the screen with his grandfather.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{will be taking}} {{a leave of absence}} to go on jury duty for the Scranton Strangler trial, leading the {{corporate}} office to send Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to cover for him. Michael forces Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to plan a second, classier Christmas party on the day Holly returns to Scranton. Michael welcomes Holly back, but becomes upset when she tells him that she and A.J. (Rob Huebel) are still in a relationship. Holly then tells the women of the office that she's giving A.J. an ultimatum: either propose to her by year's end or their relationship is over. Michael lies to Holly and tells her that he's seeing a woman named Tara from New York, and Holly shows curiosity, but Michael interprets this as potential jealousy. When Michael gets further upset over hearing about Holly's relationship with A.J., he takes her toy Woody from Toy Story—a present from A.J.—throws it in the trash, and pours his coffee on it. When Holly demands to know who did it, Michael comes forward and admits that he still has feelings for her and is hurt that, while they had to break up due to their long distance, she is nevertheless able to <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> arrangement work with A.J. This, in turn, makes her feel bad for Michael. A.J. arrives in Scranton to surprise Holly and Michael welcomes him politely. After cleaning Holly's Woody, he leaves the office and Pam follows him out, where he breaks down. In order to lift his spirits, Pam tells him about Holly's ultimatum, suggesting their relationship is not going to last very long. He returns to the party where he overhears Holly and A.J. talking about Woody, with Holly fabricating a story to cover for Michael's actions.|$|E

Geneticists have {{challenged}} the company's claim as bogus, both because the database it claimed to have is non-existent, and because previous analyses of the only reference Beothuk DNA available, from Nonosabasut and his wife Demasduit, show that it is far too fragmentary to <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> identification. The company suspended its claims after being challenged by geneticists and news media.|$|E

25|$|The plane made {{radio contact}} with {{approach}} control at Prestwick shortly before 11:00p.m. At {{this point the}} cross-wind over the main runway had, unknown to Parmentier, dropped to 14knots which made it within limits to attempt a landing on the main runway. Instead, he decided to attempt an overshoot of the main runway guided by the ground radar controller, followed by a left-hand turn that would bring the plane downwind of the alternate runway. He would then overfly the runway before looping round for his final approach. While it might sound complicated, Parmentier {{expected to be in}} visual contact with the ground which would <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> attempt relatively easy.|$|E

25|$|During much of {{the twentieth}} century, Australian governments had removed many {{aboriginal}} children from their families. This practice did great damage to the Aboriginal people, culturally and emotionally, giving rise to the term stolen generation to describe these families. Since the publication in 1997 of a federal government report, Bringing Them Home all state governments have followed {{the recommendation of the}} report in issuing formal apologies for their past practices to the Aboriginal people, as have many local governments. The Howard government refused to <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> apology on behalf of the federal government, despite pleas from the Aboriginal people and from many sections of the wider community, saying that it implied intergenerational guilt on modern non-indigenous Australia. However, the new government under Kevin Rudd led a formal bi-partisan apology on 13 February 2008.|$|E

25|$|On 7 April 1979, Hoveyda was {{transported to}} Qasr Prison, once a getaway palace for monarchs of the Qajar dynasty, but {{converted}} into a prison during the 1920s. By this time, he was now aware {{that there would be}} no mercy for him, and the whole charade would end in his own death. Quickly shuffled back in front of Khalkhali's tribunal, he once again heard the court's indictment at three in the afternoon. There is some speculation as to who ordered the resumption of the trial. Bani Sadr, one among many leaders of the Provisional Revolutionary Government who advocated a public trial, states that only Khomeini himself had the authority to <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> order. Behind locked doors, Hoveyda's fate, which had already been decided upon by Khomeini days earlier, was sealed.|$|E
25|$|No {{applications}} for dissolution {{may be made}} within one year {{of the formation of}} the civil partnership, except in Scotland. Like marriage, irretrievable breakdown is the only ground on which the court may make a dissolution order. Also, Section 44 provides that the Court may not <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> order unless the applicant satisfies as to certain facts which are the same as those for divorce under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (MCA), except that adultery cannot be relied on for a civil partnership dissolution: the respondent's behaviour, 2 years' separation and consent, 2 years' desertion or 5 years' separation. If the applicant satisfies the court in this respect, the court must make a dissolution order unless it is not convinced by the evidence that the partnership has indeed broken down irretrievably. The MCA section 5 defence is also available. While adultery cannot be cited as a reason in itself for dissolving a civil partnership, it could be cited as an example of unreasonable behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Bertrand Russell {{made the}} {{following}} {{comment on the}} Philosophical Investigations in his book My Philosophical Development:I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.Ernest Gellner wrote the book Words and Things, in which he was fiercely critical of the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, Gilbert Ryle, Antony Flew, P. F. Strawson and many others. Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal Mind (which he edited), and Bertrand Russell (who had written an approving foreword) protested in a letter to The Times. A response from Ryle and a lengthy correspondence ensued.|$|E

[...] Minton was succeeded by a Catholic, however, when President Eisenhower appointed William J. Brennan to that seat. Eisenhower sought a Catholic to appoint to the Court—in part because there had been no Catholic justice since Murphy's death in 1949, and in part because Eisenhower was directly lobbied by Cardinal Francis Spellman of the Archdiocese of New York to <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> appointment. Brennan was then the lone Catholic justice until the appointment of Antonin Scalia in 1986, and Anthony Kennedy in 1988.|$|E

In 1925, Aigler defended intercollegiate athletics against charges that they had a negative effect on institutions of higher learning. Aigler said that the harm done by athletics was almost nothing when compared to the evils caused by [...] "common loafing." [...] "The greatest vice in American college life today is loafing", said Aigler. [...] "There is no doubt that this far overshadows the harm created by intercollegiate athletics. No one would be more pleased than I to see a Phi Beta Kappa (honorary scholarship society) man receive as much recognition by the public as do our leading athletes. But such a condition would be contrary to human nature. Intellectual attainments do not <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> appeal, and that is why athletics are so prominent in colleges and universities today." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{staff of}} Parks and Recreation {{conceived}} {{the idea that}} Ron Swanson had his birthdate redacted from all government documents early {{in the development of}} the series, and it eventually developed into the subplot featured in [...] "Eagleton" [...] where Leslie finds out about his birthday and plans a surprise for him. Michael Schur, co-creator of the series, said the scene when Leslie surprises Ron with a quiet evening alone was his favorite scene in the show. During the scene, Leslie and Ron declare their mutual admiration for one another. Schur said it was difficult to <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> outwardly emotional scene effective in a comedy, but he believed it ultimately worked because of Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman's strong performances. Poehler said of the scene: [...] "It's really sweet and it's just an example of how it's important to Leslie who she works with. It's just as important as the job itself. I completely relate to that." [...] Rashida Jones also praised the scene, which she said made her cry during a cast read-through of the script.|$|E

Three pages of script, which I had to condense into one shot. Having to <b>make</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> enormous compromise was not a happy choice for me, {{but it was the}} only way of getting us back on schedule." [...] On his contribution to Inseminoid, Warren stated that Peter Boyle proved to be [...] "a pleasure to work with, because he had a natural feel for the material and managed to create just the right pace and rhythm throughout the film." [...] During the post-production process, the editing staff increased the brightness of the original print, concerned that a dim appearance would damage the chances of sales to television broadcasters, and removed the most graphic shots of the birth of the mutant children for the purposes of classification. The opening title visuals, consisting of vibrant oil frames, are a contribution of Oxford Scientific Films.|$|E
