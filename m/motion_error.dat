This article investigates <b>motion</b> <b>error</b> analysis, volumetric <b>motion</b> <b>error</b> model for transmission system and the accuracy allocation method for multiaxis machine tools during the early design stage. For this purpose, a transmission system volumetric <b>motion</b> <b>error</b> model, which is based on the <b>motion</b> <b>error</b> matrix and screw theory, is derived for mapping transmission components ’ error parameters to the volumetric motion errors of machine tools. The volumetric <b>motion</b> <b>error</b> matrix combines motion errors along the machine tools ’ kinematic chains. Subsequently, the volumetric <b>motion</b> <b>error</b> model is expressed as a volumetric <b>motion</b> <b>error</b> twist, which is formulated from the volumetric <b>motion</b> <b>error</b> matrix. Additionally, the trans-mission system volumetric <b>motion</b> <b>error</b> twist model is used as design criteria for accuracy optimum allocation, with constraints on the twist magnitude and design variable limits. Then, design optimization is performed by using a multi-objective nonlinear optimization technique to minimize the manufacturing cost and volumetric <b>motion</b> <b>error</b> twist pitch. To solve this multiple objective optimum problem, this study proposes an approach integrating Lagrange multiplier and gradient descent operator with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II searches for an allocation scheme Pareto optimal front. Consequently, VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) determines the best compromise solution from the Pareto set.

Incoherent detection {{appears as a}} multiplicative phase error to echoed signal, which consequently causes fatal degradations such as fading or dislocation of target image. In this paper, we propose a <b>motion</b> <b>error</b> correction scheme using an in-scene target to compensate for relative distance error between the radar and the target. We start by modeling from a wave equation for one point target, and then derive the complex <b>motion</b> <b>error</b> from extended overall echoed data. The proposed algorithm is also good for the correction of relatively large <b>motion</b> <b>error</b> {{because it can be}} applied repeatedly, and it is converged after each iteration. We use the spatial Doppler characteristics of the strong in-scene target to retrieve <b>motion</b> <b>error,</b> thus, we only used the partial spectral echo data corresponding to the strong in-scene target. By doing this, we can reduce computational loads and the number of iterations for the large <b>motion</b> <b>error.</b> We verify the performance of the proposed algorithm by applying it to the simulated spotlight-mode SAR data...|$|E

40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{is one of}} the {{variant of}} active remote sensing whereby it transmits energy and {{measures}} the return signal to obtain ground information. SAR is typically mounted on a moving platform such as an aircraft or a spacecraft. In this work, the SAR system is mounted on a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). One of the main obstacles faced by the UAV SAR is its instability during flight mission which causes <b>motion</b> <b>errors.</b> Theoretically, a SAR system modelling assumes that all flight path parameters (such as velocity, altitude and heading angle) are constants in generating SAR images. This would mean that ideally, the ground sampling length in between each transmission is also constant. However, this is never true in real case. These <b>motion</b> <b>errors</b> are mainly caused by wind turbulence, drag or limitations of the aircraft itself. Of all <b>motion</b> <b>errors,</b> one of the most unavoidable <b>motion</b> <b>errors</b> is the variance in velocity of the aircraft during flight which subsequently causes uneven sampling length.

40|$|Precise azimuth-variant motion {{compensation}} (MOCO) {{is an essential}} and difficult task for high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. In conventional post-filtering approaches, residual azimuth-variant <b>motion</b> <b>errors</b> are generally compensated {{through a set of}} spatial post-filters, where the coarse-focused image is segmented into overlapped blocks concerning the azimuth-dependent residual errors. However, image domain post-filtering approaches, such as precise topography- and aperture-dependent {{motion compensation}} algorithm (PTA), have difficulty of robustness in declining, when strong <b>motion</b> <b>errors</b> are involved in the coarse-focused image. In this case, in order to capture the complete motion blurring function within each image block, both the block size and the overlapped part need necessary extension leading to degeneration of efficiency and robustness inevitably. Herein, a frequency domain fast back-projection algorithm (FDFBPA) is introduced to deal with strong azimuth-variant <b>motion</b> <b>errors.</b> FDFBPA disposes of the azimuth-variant <b>motion</b> <b>errors</b> based on a precise azimuth spectrum expression in the azimuth wavenumber domain.

Then, the sub-aperture images are straightforwardly fused together in azimuth wavenumber domain to obtain a full resolution image. Moreover, chirp-Z transform (CZT) is also introduced to implement the sub-aperture back-projection integral, increasing the efficiency of the algorithm. By disusing the image domain post-filtering strategy, robustness of the proposed algorithm is improved.
