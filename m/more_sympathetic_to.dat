5|$|In {{the present}} day, several groups are {{demanding}} that Jamila be given the death sentence. One male guard, (Surya Saputra), takes pity on Jamila and tries to help her. However, Jamila ignores him. Ria, although slowly becoming <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> Jamila, gets into an argument with her over Nurdin's murder; this results in Jamila being placed in isolation.|$|E
5|$|At party level, the Labour Party, in {{opposition}} until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and {{supportive of the}} black nationalist movement on ideological and moral grounds. The Liberal Party, holding a handful of parliament seats, took a similar stance. The Conservative Party, while also following a policy of decolonisation, was <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> the Southern Rhodesian government's position, and included members who openly supported it.|$|E
5|$|Pierlot and Spaak, {{together}} with Pierlot's family, crossed into Francoist Spain with an official visa, but {{were arrested in}} Barcelona and held under house arrest in a hotel. On 18 October, they escaped from confinement and headed for Portugal where the regime of António de Oliveira Salazar, although neutral, was <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> the Allied cause than Spain. They finally arrived in London on 22 October.|$|E
50|$|Many daimyos {{converted}} to Christianity {{in order to}} gain more favorable access to saltpeter, used to make gunpowder. Between 1553 and 1620, eighty-six daimyos were officially baptized, and many <b>more</b> were <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> the Christians.|$|R
50|$|The House of Lords {{recognised}} that easements {{must always}} be exercised civiliter (without amounting to exclusive possession over the servient land), but the House of Lords displayed a <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> attitude <b>to</b> easements that substantially exclude the servient owner.|$|R
25|$|Kewell {{played in}} the 2006 FA Cup final, only to be {{substituted}} in the 48th minute due to abdominal pains (the supporters reaction this time was <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> compared <b>to</b> the previous year's Champions League final). It was later confirmed by Liverpool that he had torn a groin muscle, but {{was expected to be}} fit for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.|$|R
5|$|The Independent and Ledger offered {{different}} versions of events, the former <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> the Nelsons. According to the Independent, Laura grabbed another gun, a Winchester rifle hidden behind a trunk. L. D. grabbed the Winchester at the same time, and during the struggle for the gun, it went off. A shell passed through Constable Martin's pant legs, grazing him in the thigh, then hit Loney in the hip and entered his abdomen. He walked outside and died a few minutes later.|$|E
5|$|The Nashville Christian Leadership Council (or NCLC), {{was founded}} by the Reverend Kelly Miller Smith, pastor of First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill. This {{organization}} was an affiliate of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was established to promote civil rights for African Americans through nonviolent civil disobedience. Smith believed that White Americans would be <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> desegregation if African Americans obtained their rights through peaceful demonstration rather than through the judicial system or violent confrontation.|$|E
5|$|The {{reintegration}} of French prisoners into {{civilian life}} was facilitated by {{a network of}} Maisons du Prisonnier (Prisoner Houses), established across France, which would help them readjust and find work. Generally, prisoners generally found it easy to regain their pre-war jobs because of the shortage of labour. The government had hoped that returning prisoners of war would be <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> the Vichy regime, but prisoners coming back were not noticeably more loyal to Vichy than other groups.|$|E
50|$|He {{was much}} {{concerned}} and occupied with classical texts, as translator {{and for their}} rhetorical values. The Latin grammar on which he relied was that of William Lilye. Brinsley recommended Ovid, and the Raphael Regius edition, in A Consolation for our Grammar Schooles. In the same work he advocates a <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> approach <b>to</b> teaching, and teacher training, in several anticipations of the views of Comenius.|$|R
50|$|She {{used her}} {{experience}} of suffocation in {{marriage and the}} joy of consequent liberation in her fictional depictions of pre-suffrage women with few political rights and options, trapped in oppressive marriages. Later works would have a <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> stance <b>to</b> males, such as Babs the Impossible in which the single noble women would feel resurgence in their worth encouraged by an idealistic self-made man.|$|R
5000|$|Joe Ma as Chu Tai, Prince Yin (...) — the {{powerful}} and intelligent fourth son of Hung-mo. Though Prince Yin helps his nephew succeed the throne, his extreme governing methods tend to {{clash with the}} Kin-man Emperor's <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> approach <b>to</b> rule. Upset with the young emperor's reign — and believing himself to be the true {{heir to the throne}} — Prince Yin begins to secretly plot a coup.|$|R
5|$|In Hastings's view, Lang was {{probably}} <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> Rome {{than any other}} Church of England archbishop of modern times, responsible for a discreet catholicisation of the Church of England's practices. A small outward indication of this was his decision to use a cassock as everyday dress and to wear a mitre on formal occasions, the first archbishop since the English Reformation to do so. Lang believed that {{in relation to the}} supreme truths of the church, rituals and dress were of small account, but that if people's worship was assisted by such customs they should be allowed.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{accepted}} {{an appointment to}} the circuit court of Bourbon and Clark counties in 1817. It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred. In 1822, he struck down a debt relief law {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts. His decision was unpopular with the legislature, who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it. An attempt by the legislature to remove him from office fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. The following year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark's ruling. In retaliation, the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> their views. This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, the United States Supreme Court {{ruled the}} Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 unconstitutional. For the first time, Minton gave speeches criticizing {{the court for}} {{overriding}} the will of Congress. He accused the court of allowing itself {{to be influenced by}} political motives rather than the law. In response to the court ruling, Minton began drafting a bill which would allow the Supreme Court to declare a law unconstitutional only if seven out the nine justices supported the decision. In February 1937, before Minton introduced his bill, President Roosevelt introduced a plan of his own to deal with the Supreme Court. Roosevelt proposed adding more justices to the court and creating a mandatory retirement age; the changes would allow him to appoint an overwhelming majority to the court, <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> his agenda, ensuring the safety of legislation passed by his party.|$|E
50|$|A less-subtle {{difference}} {{is in the}} area of casting; in the pilot, Jackie Cooper portrayed Westin's superior, Walter Carlson, but for the series, the role was recast with Craig Stevens playing the part. The character was also altered <b>to</b> be <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> and closer <b>to</b> the Oscar Goldman archetype.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss the {{regulation}} of foreign banking in Indonesia, including the regulation of onshore and offshore banking activities, and local security devices. Although the offshore business of foreign banks has been relatively more active over the years than the onshore business, there has been a recent sharp increase in on- shore business, and some indication of a <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> attitude <b>to</b> onshore foreign banking by the regulatory authorities. This suggests that it is an appropriate time for surveying the foreign bank regulations of Indonesia...|$|R
5|$|The San Francisco {{regulators}} {{finished their}} report in May 1987 and recommended that Lincoln be {{seized by the}} government due to unsound lending practices. Gray, whose time as chair was about to expire, deferred action on the report, saying that his adversarial relationship with Keating would make any action he took seem vindictive, and that instead the incoming chair should take over the decision. Meanwhile, Keating {{filed a lawsuit against}} the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln. The new FHLBB chair was M. Danny Wall, who was <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> Keating and took no action on the report, saying its evidence was insufficient. In September 1987, the Lincoln investigation was removed from the San Francisco group and in May 1988, the FHLBB signed an agreement with Lincoln that included not going ahead with a criminal referral to the Department of Justice. In July 1988, a new audit of both Lincoln and American Continental began in Washington.|$|E
5|$|The novel Fairest of All: A Tale of the Wicked Queen by Serena Valentino, {{published}} by Disney Press in 2009, {{tells a story}} much <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> the Queen than most other Disney media. The book shows how the Queen became the villain from the film, much {{in the style of}} , with the Magic Mirror, here possessed by the spirit of her abusive father, having been a corrupting influence. According to the book, her mother was a witch and the King died in a war against another kingdom prior to the events of the film. After her husband's death, the Queen slowly descends into madness. By the end of novel, Snow White gets the mirror and the Queen becomes the spirit inside the mirror after her death in the film.|$|E
5|$|This {{success in}} turn {{led to a}} vogue in America and the West for Japanese movies {{throughout}} the 1950s, replacing the enthusiasm for Italian neorealist cinema. For example, {{by the end of}} 1952 Rashamon was released in Japan, the United States, and most of Europe. Among the Japanese filmmakers whose work, as a result, began to win festival prizes and commercial release in the West were Kenji Mizoguchi (The Life of Oharu, Ugetsu, Sansho the Bailiff) and, somewhat later, Yasujirō Ozu (Tokyo Story, An Autumn Afternoon)—artists highly respected in Japan but, prior to this period, almost totally unknown in the West. Kurosawa's growing reputation among Western audiences in the 1950s would make Western audiences <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> the reception of later generations of Japanese filmmakers ranging from Kon Ichikawa, Masaki Kobayashi, Nagisa Oshima and Shohei Imamura to Juzo Itami, Takeshi Kitano and Takashi Miike.|$|E
50|$|In {{the series}} reboot Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, Dracula is reimagined as an 11th-century holy knight named Gabriel Belmont {{and serves as}} the central {{character}} {{of the game and}} its two sequels. The Lords of Shadow series tell the story of Gabriel's quest to save the world, fall into darkness and journey of redemption. The series portrays Dracula in a <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> light, compared <b>to</b> his original counterpart.|$|R
25|$|In 1866, Leopold {{instructed}} the Belgian ambassador in Madrid {{to speak to}} Queen Isabella II of Spain about ceding the Philippines to Belgium. However, knowing the situation fully, the ambassador did nothing. Leopold quickly replaced the ambassador with a <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> individual <b>to</b> carry out his plan. In 1868, when Isabella II was deposed as queen of Spain, Leopold tried to press his original plan to acquire the Philippines. But without funds, he was unsuccessful. Leopold then devised another unsuccessful plan to establish the Philippines as an independent state, which could then be ruled by a Belgian. When both of these plans failed, Leopold shifted his aspirations of colonization to Africa.|$|R

5|$|No major {{alterations}} {{have been}} made since the Reformation in the 1530s and 1540s, {{but there have been}} many changes to the interior to accommodate various phases of Church of England worship. Among these are an oven used for baking communion bread in the south east corner of the north chapel. During the Civil War, considerable damage was done including the destruction of nearly all of the medieval stained glass. William III of England worshipped in the church following his landing in the Glorious Revolution of 1689. By the early 19th century, all the medieval furnishings, except the Norman font had disappeared. New pews were made and the west galleries were added in 1808-11. The latest restoration that has left the church interior visible today, took place in the late 19th century; it was <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> the church's architectural character than many Victorian restorations. At this time, the central section of the west gallery was removed to reveal the great west window and the organ was relocated to the south transept. The pews date from around 1900 and have attractive carved bench-ends. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|Wilde's life {{continues}} to fascinate, {{and he has}} been the subject of numerous biographies since his death. The earliest were memoirs by those who knew him: often they are personal or impressionistic accounts which can be good character sketches, but are sometimes factually unreliable. Frank Harris, his friend and editor, wrote a biography, Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions (1916); though prone to exaggeration and sometimes factually inaccurate, it offers a good literary portrait of Wilde. Lord Alfred Douglas wrote two books about his relationship with Wilde. Oscar Wilde and Myself (1914), largely ghost-written by T. W. H. Crosland, vindictively reacted to Douglas's discovery that De Profundis was addressed to him and defensively tried to distance him from Wilde's scandalous reputation. Both authors later regretted their work. Later, in Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up (1939) and his Autobiography he was <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> Wilde. Of Wilde's other close friends, Robert Sherard; Robert Ross, his literary executor; and Charles Ricketts variously published biographies, reminiscences or correspondence. The first more or less objective biography of Wilde came about when Hesketh Pearson wrote Oscar Wilde: His Life and Wit (1946). In 1954 Wilde's son Vyvyan Holland published his memoir Son of Oscar Wilde, which recounts the difficulties Wilde's wife and children faced after his imprisonment. It was revised and updated by Merlin Holland in 1989.|$|E

50|$|This era saw anti-liberal sentiments {{and declining}} {{fortunes}} of the Liberal party which had held power since 1867 apart from a brief spell of conservative government in 1870-1. In 1870 Liberal support for Prussia in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War displeased the Emperor {{and he turned to}} the Conservatives to form a government under Count Karl Sigmund von Hohenwart (1871). Hohenwart was the conservative leader in parliament, and the Emperor believed his <b>more</b> <b>sympathetic</b> views <b>to</b> Slavic aspirations and federalism would weaken the Austro-German Liberals. Hohenwart appointed Albert Schäffle as his commerce minister and drew up a policy known as the Fundamental Articles of 1871 (Fundamentalartikel). The policy failed, the Emperor withdrew his support and the Liberals regained power.|$|R
