50|$|A <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> {{generally}} {{refers to}} the difference between the maturities of a company's assets and liabilities. A <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> affects a company's ability to survive a period of stress that may limit its access to funding and to withstand shocks in the yield curve. For example, if a company relies on short-term funding to finance longer-term positions, it will be subject to significant refunding risk that may force it to sell assets at low market prices or potentially suffer through significant margin pressure. However, maturity mismatches are not confined to the use of short-term liabilities and can exist at any point in the maturity schedule of a nonbank financial company's assets and liabilities.|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} a new discord in the Austrian {{economic}} theory {{about the effects}} of <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatching</b> practiced by banks on the shape of the yield curve and defines the not yet established concept of the natural yield curve. The conflicting contributions of Austrian authors are compared for that purpose. Based on this comparison, a coherent theory of the effects of <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatching</b> is presented in a framework of the loanable funds market. A definition of the natural yield curve is then produced by a synthesis of the above-mentioned findings and the Austrian theory of the natural rate of interest. Theoretical research leads to the conclusion that one form of <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatching</b> inevitably results in an Austrian business cycle. The empirical section examines the question of yield curve´s behavior under the influence of <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatching.</b> An explanation concerning the selected hypotheses and their lack of confirmation is given...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} work on currency mismatches, {{research on the}} determinants and effects of <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatches</b> is scarce. In this paper I show that emerging market banks. <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatches</b> are negatively affected by capital inflows and price volatilities. Furthermore, I find that banks with low <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatches</b> are more profitable during crisis periods but less profitable otherwise. The later result implies that banks face a tradeoff between higher returns and risk, hence channeling short term capital into long term loans is caused by cronyism and implicit guarantees rather than {{the depth of the}} financial market. The positive relationship between <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatches</b> and price volatility, on the other hand, shows that the banks of countries with high exchange rate and interest rate volatilities can not, or choose not to hedge themselves. These results follow from a panel regression on a data set I constructed by merging bank level data with aggregate data.

A dramatic rise in the interest rate faced by a government due to fear that it will fail to honor its debt is sometimes called a sovereign debt crisis.

50|$|As the {{mortgage}} {{situation in the}} United States became more serious, market became unwilling to purchase ABCP. This caused trouble for financial institutions that had relied on sales of ABCP to obtain funds for use in longer-term investments (see <b>Maturity</b> <b>mismatch).</b> For example, as one form of the ABCP program, the structured investment vehicles (SIVs) set up by some commercial banks financed their longer-term, higher-yield investing through sales of ABCP. This had been very profitable when ABCP was considered safe (so that ABCP buyers accepted a low interest rate). When some asset prices dropped, investors were less willing to buy or rollover ABCP. This forced SIVs to quickly liquidate their longer-term investments at a substantial loss. The losses together with the panic in liquidity market formed a liquidity shock to the banking sector, which helped the contagion of the crisis.|$|E

5000|$|In a June 2008 speech, President and CEO of the New York Federal Reserve Bank Timothy Geithner—who in 2009 became Secretary of the United States Treasury—placed {{significant}} {{blame for}} the freezing of credit markets on a [...] "run" [...] on the entities in the [...] "parallel" [...] banking system, also called the shadow banking system. These entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system, but were {{not subject to the}} same regulatory controls. Further, these entities were vulnerable because of <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch,</b> meaning that they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term, illiquid and risky assets. This meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging, selling their long-term assets at depressed prices. He described the significance of these entities: [...] In early 2007, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, in structured investment vehicles, in auction-rate preferred securities, tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes, had a combined asset size of roughly $2.2 trillion. Assets financed overnight in triparty repo grew to $2.5 trillion. Assets held in hedge funds grew to roughly $1.8 trillion. The combined balance sheets of the then five major investment banks totaled $4 trillion. In comparison, the total assets of the top five bank holding companies in the United States at that point were just over $6 trillion, and total assets of the entire banking system were about $10 trillion. The combined effect of these factors was a financial system vulnerable to self-reinforcing asset price and credit cycles.|$|E
5000|$|Some Amsterdam {{merchant}} bankers were leveraged {{far beyond}} their capacity. Financial activity in late-eighteenth century Amsterdam {{was controlled by}} a group of merchant banking firms. These “bankers” were proprietary firms that dealt in trade goods and that also provided financing to other merchants. These firms were not deposit banks in the English conventional tradition, as deposit taking was viewed as incredibly risky. Since deposits were scarce, financial intermediation was accomplished through a securitization scheme known as the acceptance loan. The building block of the acceptance loan was an instrument known as the bill of exchange — ultimately a contract to pay a fixed sum of money at a future date. Bills of exchange were originally designed as short-term contracts but gradually became heavily used for long-term borrowing. They were typically rolled over and became de facto short-term loans to finance longer-term projects, which resulted {{in the creation of a}} classic balance sheet <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch.</b> At that time, bills of exchange could be re-sold, with each seller serving as a guarantor to the bill and, by implication, insuring the buyer of the bill against default. This practice prevented the circulation of low-credit-quality bills among market participants and created a kind of “credit wrapper”—a guarantee for the specific loan—by making all signatories jointly liable for a particular bill. In addition, low acceptance fees—the fees paid to market participants for taking on the obligation to pay the bill of exchange—implied a perceived negligible risk. However, the complexity of this system had underlying ramifications - the practice also resulted in binding market participants together through their balance sheets: one bank might have a receivable asset and a payable liability for the same bill of exchange, even when no goods were traded. By the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, high leverage and balance sheet interconnectedness left merchant bankers highly vulnerable to any slowdown in credit availability. Merchant bankers believed that their balance sheet growth and leverage were hedged and insured through offsetting claims and liabilities. And while some of the more conservative Dutch bankers were wary in growing their wartime business, others expanded quickly. One of the fastest growing merchant banks belonged to the De Neufville brothers, who speculated in depreciating currencies and endorsed a large number of bills of exchange. Leendert Pieter de Neufville was the leading perpetrator of the proliferation of the faulty bills of exchange. Noting his success, other merchant bankers followed suit. The crisis was triggered when De Neufville entered with 100.000 guilders into a deal by Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky to buy grain stored in Kolberg, etc., worth almost 1,2 million guilders, from the Russian army, c.q. Vasily Dolgorukov-Krymsky, as he left Poland. Frederick the Great ordered the grain traders to sell it on the Prussian market, but in May 1763 grain prices collapsed by more than 75 percent. The dealers that had not followed his advise, made heavy losses.|$|E

40|$|Output {{growth in}} {{emerging}} markets is significantly more volatile than in advanced economies, {{due in large}} part to fluctuations in total factor productivity (TFP). This paper shows that where <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> is widespread, as in emerging markets, capital flow volatility amplifies the volatility of both output and TFP. I build a model of a small open economy in which financial frictions force firms to fund long-term projects with short-term debt. Greater uncertainty regarding the future availability of foreign borrowing causes firms to cut long-term investment. This depresses aggregate investment and generates an endogenous drop in aggregate productivity. Conversely, a fall in uncertainty increases investment, output, and TFP. Shocks to capital flow volatility will therefore amplify the volatility of output and TFP in emerging markets where <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> is pervasive, but not in advanced economies. Using data from a panel of major emerging markets, I show that the volatility of portfolio debt flows negatively affects output by dampening investment, while the volatility of equity flows, which do not generate <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch,</b> has no effect. Moreover I find that the negative impact of volatility is mitigated by financial market development, which I use as a proxy for the extent of <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> in the economy. These empirical results suggest that <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> acts as an important channel through which uncertainty shocks affect the real economy.

40|$|Substantial {{attention}} has been paid in recent years to the risk of <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> in emerging markets. Although this risk is microeconomic in nature, the evidence advanced thus far has taken the form of macro correlations. We evaluate this mechanism empirically at the micro level by using a database of over 3000 publicly listed firms from fifteen emerging markets. We measure the risk of <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> by estimating, at the firm level, the effect on investment of the interaction of short-term exposure and aggregate capital flight. This effect is (statistically) zero, contrary to the prediction of the maturity-mismatch hypothesis. This conclusion is robust to using a variety of different estimators, alternative measures of capital flows, and controls for devaluation effects and access to international capital. We do find evidence that short-term-exposed firms pay higher financing costs, and have lower equity valuations, but not that this reduction in net worth translates into a drop in investment or sales. <b>Maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> Investment Financial crises...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} international capital flows on small open economies from a theoretical and empirical perspective. The �first chapter shows that where <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> is widespread, as in emerging markets, greater capital flow volatility negatively affects investment, output, and aggregate productivity. I build {{a model of a}} small open economy in which �financial frictions force �firms to engage in <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch,</b> funding long-term projects with short-term debt. Greater uncertainty regarding the future availability of foreign borrowing causes �firms to cut long-term investment, depressing aggregate investment and generating an endogenous drop in aggregate productivity. The second chapter {{examines the}} relationship between capital flow volatility and economic performance using unique monthly frequency data set on international capital flows. I show that it is specifically the volatility of portfolio debt flows that negatively affects investment. Using �financial development as a proxy for the extent of <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> in the economy, I �find that the negative impact of debt flows is smaller where financial markets are more developed. Finally, I use industry-level data to show capital flow volatility depresses investment more in industries with longer average time-to-build. These �findings are consistent with a role for <b>maturity</b> <b>mismatch</b> in transmitting volatility shocks. The third chapter studies episodes of large capital in flows. These events are typically followed by an economic downturn and a reallocation of labor and capital into the nontradables sector. The extent of labor reallocation is significantly related to the depth and length of the post-episode downturn. We interpret our results using a model of a two sector economy, showing that capital in flows episodes generated by a fall in international interest rates or a rise in future productivity will push labor into the notradables sector. In flows caused by a productivity increase that has already occurred shift labor into tradables production. Allocation of labor therefore provides information on the underlying shock driving the capital inflows...|$|E
