5000|$|Many modern tripods are {{constructed}} of aluminum, though wood is still used for legs. The feet are either aluminum tipped with a steel point or steel. The <b>mounting</b> <b>screw</b> is often brass or brass and plastic. The <b>mounting</b> <b>screw</b> is hollow {{to allow the}} optical plumb to be viewed through the screw. The top is typically threaded with a 5/8" [...] x 11 tpi screw thread. The <b>mounting</b> <b>screw</b> is held to {{the underside of the}} tripod head by a movable arm. This permits the screw to be moved anywhere within the head's opening. The legs are attached to the head with adjustable screws that are usually kept tight enough to allow the legs to be moved with a bit of resistance. The legs are two part, with the lower part capable of telescoping to adjust the length of the leg to suit the terrain. Aluminum or steel slip joints with a tightening screw are {{at the bottom of the}} upper leg to hold the bottom part in place and fix the length. A shoulder strap is often affixed to the tripod to allow for ease of carrying the equipment over areas to be surveyed.|$|E
5000|$|An M.2 module is {{installed}} into a mating connector {{provided by the}} host's circuit board, and a single <b>mounting</b> <b>screw</b> secures the module into place. Components may be mounted {{on either side of}} the module, with the actual module type limiting how thick the components can be; the maximum allowable thickness of components is 1.5 mm per side. Different host-side connectors are used for single- and double-sided M.2 modules, providing different amounts of space between the M.2 expansion card and the host's PCB. [...] Circuit boards on the hosts are usually designed to accept multiple lengths of M.2 modules, which means that the sockets capable of accepting longer M.2 modules usually also accept shorter ones by providing different positions for the <b>mounting</b> <b>screw.</b>|$|E

The [...] M42 thread mount (originally {{created by}} Contax, but {{sometimes}} {{also referred to}} as Pentax <b>screw</b> <b>mount,</b> or universal <b>screw</b> <b>mount,</b> or TM for thread mount) was widely used among many manufacturers and was also easily mated to other camera mounts with simple adapters, making these lenses widely used and appreciated.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} issue Bass VI had three Stratocaster-style single coil pickups (although the internal construction was {{more similar to}} the Telecaster's bridge pickup with its metal base and <b>mounting</b> <b>screws),</b> which were <b>mounted</b> in special chrome rings and were controlled {{by a panel of}} three on/off slider switches rather than the conventional three-position switch.|$|R
50|$|Older {{surveying}} tripods had {{slightly different}} features compared to modern ones. For example, on some older tripods, the instrument {{had its own}} footplate and {{did not need to}} move laterally relative to the tripod head. For this reason, the head of the tripod was not a flat footplate but was simply a large diameter fitting. Threads {{on the outside of the}} head engaged threads on the instrument's footplate. No other <b>mounting</b> <b>screw</b> was used.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{the filters}} used Korg's {{proprietary}} KORG-35 thick film IC. Later, the filters were redesigned to use off-the-shelf LM13600 OTAs. MS-20 units fitted with LM13600 filters {{have a small}} daughter board; the front panel on such units often has a tell-tale <b>mounting</b> <b>screw</b> whose head is visible {{in the vicinity of}} the VCA block diagram. However, a report to the Analogue Heaven email list in January 2010 identified an MS-20 with the front panel screw but containing the Korg 35 filter thick film circuit rather than the expected LM13600 circuit.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of tripods. The least expensive, {{generally}} made of aluminum tubing and costing less than US$50, is used primarily for consumer still and video cameras; these generally come with an attached head and rubber feet. The head is very basic, and often not entirely suitable for smooth panning of a camcorder. A common feature, mostly designed for still cameras, allows the head to flip sideways 90 degrees to allow the camera to take pictures in portrait format rather than landscape. Often included is a small pin {{on the front of}} the <b>mounting</b> <b>screw</b> that is used to stabilize camcorders. This is not found on the more expensive photographic tripods.|$|E

Audible differences could result from the <b>mounting</b> <b>screws,</b> grille fabric, or the origin of the wool.|$|R
50|$|Positioning: Bottle dynamos must be {{carefully}} adjusted to touch the sidewall at correct angles, height and pressure. Bottle dynamos can be knocked out of position if the bike falls, or if the <b>mounting</b> <b>screws</b> are too loose.

50|$|Threaded {{mounting}} holes in racks where {{the equipment is}} frequently changed are problematic because the threads can be damaged or the <b>mounting</b> <b>screws</b> can break off; both problems render the mounting hole unusable. Tapping large numbers of holes that may never be used is expensive; nonetheless tapped-hole racks are still in use, generally for hardware that rarely changes. Examples include telephone exchanges, network cabling panels, broadcast studios and some government and military applications.|$|R
50|$|Wolf tones {{are usually}} only noticed on bowed instruments, {{most notably the}} violin family, since the tones {{produced}} are played for much longer periods, and thus are easier to hear. Frequently, the wolf is present on or in between the pitches E and F on the cello, and around G on the double bass.A wolf can be reduced or eliminated {{with a piece of}} equipment called a wolf tone eliminator. This is a metal tube and <b>mounting</b> <b>screw</b> with an interior rubber sleeve, that fits around the offending string below the bridge. Different placements of this tube along the string influence or eliminate the frequency at which the wolf occurs. It is essentially an attenuator that slightly shifts the natural frequency of the string (and/or instrument body) cutting down on the reverberation.|$|E

40|$|Microwave {{communication}} devices have become ubiquitous {{in the past}} decade. As {{an increasing number of}} systems compete for spectrum, guard bands have shrunk to increase bandwidth efficiency. The frequency behaviour of microwave devices is affected by thermal expansion. In order to avoid interference with adjacent bands, microwave components must exhibit high temperature-stability in most communications applications. Thermally stable materials can be used to construct temperature-stable components. However, this approach requires an expensive mass and cost trade-off. Temperature compensated aluminum resonators and filters provide major advantages in cost and mass. This work proposes that a compensating tuning screw with a temperature-dependent effective length be constructed by mounting a bimetallic compensator {{at the end of a}} <b>mounting</b> <b>screw.</b> This so-called bimetal tuning-screw can be used to produce temperature-compensated resonators and filters. There are several advantages to this approach. Compensation can be tuned by adjusting the depth of the bimetal, simply by adjusting the <b>mounting</b> <b>screw.</b> Since there are no moving parts inside the cavity or filter, and the bimetal can be plated, there are no additional sources of passive intermodulation. Also, this design is simple to implement for waveguide designs in general. In order to compensate for temperature drift, it is useful to quantify uncompensated drift. Temperature drift for a lossless linearly expanding RF component is derived from Maxwell's equations. For the lossy case, it is demonstrated that the resulting formula is approximately true, and that the quality of this approximation is excellent for practical levels of temperature range and thermal expansion. Experimental results are provided that demonstrate bimetal compensation under uniform-temperature conditions for a single aluminum resonator. Measured drift of the compensated resonator is - 0. 38 ppm/°C, compared to - 23 ppm/°C for an uncompensated resonator. Measured drift for a bimetal-compensated 4 -pole filter prototype is 2. 35 ppm/°C. A method for adjusting compensation for a filter is also provided. Multiphysics simulations are used to examine power handling for bimetal-compensated filters. It is demonstrated that power-handling can be improved by reducing the effective length of the compensator to improve heat conduction to the cavity or filter...|$|E
