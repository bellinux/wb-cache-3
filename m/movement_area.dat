The entire base {{is a military}} security area and completely surrounded by a fence and thus not open to the general public. Admittance to the barracks area is granted {{to members of the}} Bundeswehr and Allied forces. In this part administrative, social, sports and medical facilities, and the quarters are situated. The air field is especially fenced in and contains the <b>movement</b> <b>area,</b> aprons and hangars as well as facilities for operating the airfield (radar, tower and point obstruction lights). Like on civil aerodromes access to this part is granted only for employees working there, crew members and passengers.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately 27seconds {{later the}} Airport <b>Movement</b> <b>Area</b> Safety System (AMASS) issued an aural warning of an {{imminent}} collision, {{and the local}} controller instructed the SkyWest aircraft to stop, transmitting, [...] "uh, sky-, skywest uhh fifty seven forty one HOLD HOLD HOLD". The SkyWest aircraft {{came to a stop}} in the intersection of runways 1L and 28R, while Republic Airlines flight lifted off and overflew it. The initial FAA tower report estimated the aircraft missed colliding by 300feet; however the Skywest crew estimated the distance as 30 to 50feet.|$|E
5000|$|In Canada, the <b>movement</b> <b>area</b> {{consists}} of the manoeuvering area and aprons.In the United States, the <b>movement</b> <b>area</b> excludes aprons. Federal Aviation Regulations part 139.5 states, [...] "Movement area means the runways, taxiways, and other areas of an airport that are used for taxiing, takeoff, and landing of aircraft, exclusive of loading ramps and aircraft parking areas." [...] At airports/heliports with a tower, specific approval for entry onto the <b>movement</b> <b>area</b> must be obtained from air traffic control.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Vehicle target {{detection}} and tracking method based on image super-resolution reconstruction and variable template matching is put forward. Firstly, a nonlinear iterative algorithm {{is applied to}} reconstruct a super-resolution image from low resolution image sequence; then, the image is standardized and the <b>movement</b> <b>areas</b> are determined; finally, the variable template matching method is used to detect and track the vehicle targets in <b>movement</b> <b>areas.</b> From the characteristics of algorithm and the experiment results, {{we can see that}} the proposed algorithm improves the matching accuracy of target tracking and better solves the limitation of missed detection for traditional methods. The reason of the good performance of the proposed algorithm relies in high quality images acquired by super-resolution reconstruction from low resolution image sequence and the application of variable template matching method...|$|R
