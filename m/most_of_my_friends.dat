60|$|A {{little farther}} on I found grass and {{pavement}} soaking and flooded, {{and the red}} and yellow flames repainted in pools and puddles. Beyond were dim huddles of people and a small distant voice shouting out orders. The fire-engines were at work. I went on among the red reflections, which seemed like subterranean fires; I had a singular sensation {{of being in a}} very important dream. Oddly enough, this was increased when I found that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> and neighbours were entangled in the crowd. Only in dreams do we see familiar faces so vividly against a black background of midnight. I was glad to find (for the workman cyclist's sake) that the fire was not in the houses by the wood-yard, but in the wood-yard itself. There was no fear for human life, and the thing was seemingly accidental; though there were the usual ugly whispers about rivalry and revenge. But for all that I could not shake off my dream-drugged soul a swollen, tragic, portentous sort of sensation, that it all {{had something to do with}} the crowning of the English King, and the glory or the end of England. It was not till I saw the puddles and the ashes in broad daylight next morning that I was fundamentally certain that my midnight adventure had not happened outside this world.|$|E
6000|$|We {{removed to}} Winchester for the {{convenience}} of a library, and find it an exceeding pleasant town, enriched with a beautiful Cathedral, and surrounded by a fresh-looking country. We are in tolerably good and cheap lodgings--Within these two months I have written 1500 lines, most of which, besides many more of prior composition, you will probably see by next winter. I have written 2 tales, one from Boccaccio, called the Pot of Basil, and another called St. Agnes's Eve, on a popular Superstition, and a 3{rd} called Lamia (half finished). I have also been writing parts of my [...] "Hyperion," [...] and completed 4 Acts of a tragedy. It was the opinion of <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> that I should never be able to write a scene. I will endeavour to wipe away the prejudice--I sincerely hope you will be pleased when my labours, since we last saw each other, shall reach you. One of my Ambitions is to make as great a revolution in modern dramatic writing as Kean has done in acting. Another to upset the drawling of the blue-stocking literary world--if in the Course of a few years I do these two things, I ought to die content, and my friends should drink a dozen of claret on my tomb. I am convinced more and more every day that (excepting the human friend philosopher), a fine writer is the most genuine being in the world. Shakspeare and the Paradise lost every day become greater wonders to me. I look upon fine phrases like a lover. I was glad to see by a passage of one of Brown's letters, some time ago, from the North that you were in such good spirits. Since that you have been married, and in congratulating you I wish you every continuance of them. Present my respects to Mrs. Bailey. This sounds oddly to me, and I daresay I do it awkwardly enough: but I suppose by this time it is nothing new to you. Brown's remembrances to you. As far as I know, we shall remain at Winchester for a goodish while.|$|E

You think me a bad woman—you don’t respect me; I told you that in Paris. I’ve done things I don’t understand, myself, to-day; that I admit as fully as you please. But I’ve completely changed, and I want to change everything. You ought to enter into that, you ought to see what I want. I hate everything that has happened to me before this; I loathe it, I despise it. I went on that way trying—trying one thing and another. But now I’ve got what I want. Do you expect me to go down on my knees to you? I believe I will, I’m so anxious. You can help me—no one else can do a thing; they’re only waiting to see if he’ll do it. I told you in Paris you could help me, and it’s just as true now. Say a good word for me for Christ’s sake! You haven’t lifted your little finger, or I should know it by this time. It will just make the difference. Or if your sister would come and see me I should be all right. Women are pitiless, pitiless, and you’re pitiless too. It isn’t that Mrs. Dolphin’s anything so great, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> are better than that!—but she’s the one woman who knows, and every one seems to know she knows. He knows it, and he knows she doesn’t come. So she kills me—she kills me! I understand perfectly what he wants—I’ll do everything, be anything, I’ll be the most perfect wife. The old woman will adore me when she knows me—it’s too stupid of her not to see. Everything in the past’s over; it has all fallen away from me; it’s the life of another woman. This was what I wanted; I knew I should find it some day. I knew I should be at home in the best—and with the highest. What could I do in those horrible places? I had to take what I could. But now I’ve got nice surroundings. I want you to do me justice. You’ve never done me justice. That’s what I sent for you for.” ...|$|E
60|$|I have immensely rejoiced to {{hear from}} you to-night, though I swear on my honour that {{that has nothing to do}} with this inveterate--isn't it?--and {{essentially}} pious pleasure, belonging to the date, of making you myself a sign. I have had the sad sense, for too long past, of being horrid, however (of never having acknowledged--at the psychological moment--your beautiful and interesting last;) and it has been for me as if I should get no more than my deserts were you to refuse altogether any more commerce with me. Your noble magnanimity lifting that shadow from my spirit, I perform this friendly function now, with a lighter heart and a restored confidence. Being horrid (in those ways,) none the less, seems to announce itself as my final doom and settled attitude: I grow horrider and horrider (as a correspondent) as I grow more aged and more obese, without at the same time finding that my social air clears itself as completely as those vices or disfigurements would seem properly to guarantee. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> and relatives are dead, and a due proportion of the others seem to be dying; in spite of which my daily prospect, these many months past, has bristled almost overwhelmingly with People, and to People more or less on the spot, or just off it, in motors (and preparing to be more than ever on it again,) or, most of all haling me up to town for feverish and expensive dashes, in the name of damnable and more than questionable duties, interests, profits and pleasures--to such unaccountable and irrepressible hordes, I say, I keep having to sacrifice heavily. The world, to my great inconvenience--that is the London aggregation of it--insists on treating me as suburban--which gives me thus the complication without my having any of the corresponding ease (if ease there be) of the state; and appalling is the immense incitement to that sort of invasion or expectation that the universal motor-use (hereabouts) compels one to reckon with. But this is a profitless groan--drawn from me by a particularly ravaged summer and autumn, as it happens--and at a season of existence and in general conditions in which one had fixed one's confidence on precious simplifications. A house and a little garden and a little possible hospitality, in a little supposedly picturesque place 60 miles from London are, in short, stiff final facts that (in our more and more awful age) utterly decline to be simplified--and here I sit in the midst of them and exhale to you (to you almost only!) my helpless plaint. Fortunately, for the moment, I take the worst to be over. I've a young--a very young--American nephew who has come to me from his Oxford tutor to spend Xmas, and I have, in order to amuse him, engaged to go with him to-morrow and remain till Saturday with some friends six miles hence; but after that I cling to the vision of a great stretch of undevastated time here till April, or better still May, when I may go up to town for a month. Absorbing occupations--the only ones I really care for--await me in abysmal arrears--but I spare you my further overflow.|$|E
6000|$|I have, I know, {{been quite}} portentously silent--your brief card of {{distress}} to-night (Saturday p.m.--) {{makes me feel}} it--but you on your side will also have felt the inevitability of this absence of mere vain and vague remark {{in the presence of}} such prodigious realities. My overwhelmed sense of them has simply left me nothing to say--the rupture with all the blest old proportion of things has been so complete and utter, and I've felt as if <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> (from very few of whom I have heard at all) were so wrapped in gravities and dignities of silence that it wasn't fair to write to them simply to make them write. And so it has gone--the whole thing defying expression so that one has just stared at the horror and watched it grow. But I am not writing now, dearest old friend, to express either alarm or despair--and this mainly by reason of there being so high a decency in not doing so. I hate not to possess my soul--and oh I should like, while I am about that, to possess yours for you too. One doesn't possess one's soul unless one squares oneself a good deal, in fact very hard indeed, for the purpose; but in proportion as one succeeds that means preparation, and preparation means confidence, and confidence means force, and that is as far as we need go for the moment. Your few words express a bad apprehension which I don't share--and which even our straight outlook here over the blue channel of all these amazing days, toward the unthinkable horrors of its almost other edge, doesn't make me share. I don't in the least believe that the Germans will be [...] "here"--with us generally--because I don't believe--I don't admit--that anything so abject as the allowance of it by our overwhelming Fleet, in conditions making it so tremendously difficult for them (the G.'s), is in the least conceivable. Things {{are not going to be}} so easy for them as that--however uneasy they may be for ourselves. I insist on a great confidence--I cultivate it as resolutely as I can, and if we were only nearer together I think I should be able to help you to some of the benefit of it. I have been very thankful to be on this spot all these days--I mean in this sympathetic little old house, which has somehow assuaged in a manner the nightmare. One invents arts for assuaging it--of which some work better than others. The great sore sense I find the futility of talk--about the cataclysm: this is so impossible that I can really almost talk about other things!... I am supposing you see a goodish many people--since one hears that there are so many in town, and I am glad for you of that: solitude in these conditions being grim, even if society is bleak! I try to read and I rather succeed, and also even to write, and find the effort of it greatly pays. Lift up your heart, dearest friend--I believe we shall meet to embrace and look back and tell each other how appallingly interesting the whole thing [...] "was."

60|$|All my {{publishing}} {{interests and}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> literary <b>friends</b> were in New York (my support came from there), hence my frequent coming and going.

40|$|This project {{originated}} {{with a single}} question: Why do many young adults today lack basic life skills? This question came to mind when I noticed that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> college <b>friends</b> are clueless {{about how to do}} the laundry or how to use a vacuum cleaner. After giving this question considerable thought, I began to research changes in family relationships, culture, and psychology to better understand this phenomenon. I have focused my research on Taiwan, my country. Most families in Taiwan distribute housework between the parents rather than among the children. The primary duty of children is to study hard and earn good grades to bring honor to their family. In this situation, children are unlikely to do housework because of their schoolwork load and leave the responsibility to their parents, which leads to poor behavior {{on the part of the}} children, who have no idea how to perform housework. Additionally, when parents are responsible for all the housework, it results in greater stress and less quality family time. Children who grow up in this scenario often lack experience in doing housework and in receiving guidance from their parents. Without these basic life skills, it is more difficult for people to live independently, which is why more and more young adults are living with their parents even after they have begun working. Therefore, I plan to design a system and devices to help parents as well as children in this situation. Parents will be able to teach basic housework skills to their children in a playful way so that children will be encouraged to start helping around the house...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{has three}} goals {{related to the}} {{automorphism}} groups of finite p-groups. The primary goal {{is to provide a}} complete proof of a theorem showing that, in some asymptotic sense, the automorphism group of almost every finite p-group is itself a p-group. We originally proved this theorem in a paper with Martin; the presentation of the proof here contains omitted proof details and revised exposition. We also give a survey of the extant results on automorphism groups of finite p-groups, focusing on the order of the automorphism groups and on known examples. Finally, we explore a connection between automorphisms of finite p-groups and Markov chains. Specifically, we define a family of Markov chains on an elementary abelian p-group and bound the convergence rate of some of those chains. Acknowledgments First, I would like to thank my advisor, Persi Diaconis. Over the past five years, he has shown me the beautiful connections between random walks, combinatorics, finite group theory, and plenty of other mathematics. His continued encouragement and advice made the completion of this thesis possible.

5000|$|In the {{critical}} press {{the reception of}} Scott’s early poems on their first appearance in print was, on the whole, encouraging. Though the reviews of Matthew Lewis’s Tales of Wonder were largely unfriendly, he noted that “Amidst the general depreciation…my small share of the obnoxious publication was dismissed without censure, {{and in some cases}} obtained praise from the critics”; the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border was ringingly applauded for both its traditional and original ballads. To the poet Anna Seward, who expressed her delight with “Glenfinlas”, Scott reported that “all Scotchmen prefer the 'Eve of St. John' to 'Glenfinlas', and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> English <b>friends</b> entertain precisely an opposite opinion”. He himself took the Scottish view. In 1837 his son-in-law and biographer J. G. Lockhart reluctantly half-agreed with those critics who, he tells us, thought that the German influences on Scott did not suit the poem’s Celtic theme, and that the original legend was more moving than Scott’s elaboration of it. Nevertheless, some 19th century critics rated it very high among Scott’s poems. [...] In 1897 the critic George Saintsbury judged “Glenfinlas” and “The Eve” to be the poems in which Scott first found his true voice, though he preferred “The Eve”. [...] 20th and 21st century critics have generally been more severe. Among Scott’s biographers, John Buchan thought it “prentice work, full of dubious echoes and conventional artifice”, S. Fowler Wright found the ballad unsatisfactory because the original story has too little variety of incident, and Edgar Johnson thought the poem too slow, its language sometimes over-luscious, and the intended horror of its climax unachieved. Recently the critic Terence Hoagwood complained that the poem is less vivid than “The Eve”, and its morality (like that of “Christabel” and “La Belle Dame sans Merci”) is misogynistic.|$|R
5000|$|I had {{not been}} with Denikin {{more than a month}} before I was forced to the {{conclusion}} that the Jew represented a very big element in the Russian upheaval. The officers and men of the Army laid practically all the blame for their country's troubles on the Hebrew. They held that the whole cataclysm had been engineered by some great and mysterious secret society of international Jews, who, in the pay and at the orders of Germany, had seized the psychological moment and snatched the reins of government. All the figures and facts that were then available appeared to lend colour to this contention. No less than 82 per cent of the Bolshevik Commissars were known to be Jews, the fierce and implacable 'Trotsky,' who shared office with Lenin, being a Yiddisher whose real name was Bronstein. Among Denikin's officers this idea was an obsession of such terrible bitterness and insistency as to lead them into making statements of the wildest and most fantastic character. Many of them had persuaded themselves that Freemasonry was, in alliance with the Jews, part and parcel of the Bolshevik machine, and that what they had called the diabolical schemes for Russia's downfall had been hatched in the Petrograd and Moscow Masonic lodges. When I told them that I and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> best <b>friends</b> were Freemasons, and that England owed a great deal to its loyal Jews, they stared at me askance and sadly shook their heads in fear for England's credulity in trusting the chosen race. One even asked me quietly whether I personally was a Jew. When America showed herself decidedly against any kind of interference in Russia, the idea soon gained wide credence that President Woodrow Wilson was a Jew, while Mr. Lloyd George was referred to as a Jew whenever a cable from England appeared to show him as being lukewarm in support of the anti-Bolsheviks.|$|R
