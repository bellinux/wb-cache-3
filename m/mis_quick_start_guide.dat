40|$|Manual {{accompanying}} a CD-ROM. "Overview: How {{to operate}} a refuge chamber: a <b>quick</b> <b>start</b> <b>guide</b> was created {{by researchers at the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to teach miners how to operate refuge chambers if it became necessary in a mine emergency. The presentation is intended for group-based training and was created using Microsoft PowerPoint. It is designed {{to be used as a}} template for mine instructors to modify based on the refuge chambers used at their mine. Background Information: Refuge chambers are portable chambers that are either made of steel or are tents that inflate from a steel skid. They provide water, food, toilet, breathable air, and a seal to protect occupants from the outside environment for at least 96 hours, or 4 days. Although states and mines refer to refuge alternatives by different names, this guide will refer to those nearest to the face as refuge chambers, whether inflatable from a skid or constructed from steel. Other popular terms for refuge chambers are rescue shelters and refuge shelters. Refuges that are toward the mine entrance or shaft, whether a prefabricated refuge chamber or one built into a crosscut, will be referred to as outby refuges because of their location in the mine. Outby refuges can be permanent, semipermanent, or portable and are usually located at every other self-contained selfrescuer (SCSR) cache. Outby refuges are sometimes called hardened rooms, outby shelters, and in-place shelters. The term "refuge alternatives" is used to describe both refuge chambers and outby refuges. This training is intended for refuge chambers that are prefabricated by manufacturers. This presentation may, however, be useful for other types of refuge alternatives as long as the instructor adapts the <b>Quick</b> <b>Start</b> <b>Guide</b> to fit the operation of the refuge alterative. Purpose: The purpose of this training presentation is to teach underground miners how {{to operate a}} refuge chamber using a <b>Quick</b> <b>Start</b> <b>Guide.</b> Refuge chambers are a technology that may be new to miners. Therefore, this training will assist the instructor in developing a quality training tool to teach miners how to operate refuge chambers based on <b>Quick</b> <b>Start</b> <b>Guides.</b> It is designed to be used as a template for mine instructors to modify based on the refuge chambers used at their mine" [...] NIOSHTIC- 2.
