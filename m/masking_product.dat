40|$|Delineation and {{characterization}} of areas subject to periodical inundation remains {{a challenge in}} the study of Amazonian wetlands, considering the geographical complexity of these environments. Hess et al. (2003) performed the only existing wetland habitat map for the mainstem Amazon floodplain, using synthetic aperture radar images from the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite 1 (JERS- 1). These authors have produced a wetlands <b>mask</b> <b>product</b> for the entire basin, which has been used extensively by researchers. Recent studies have shown evidence of geometric distortion and mapping inconsistencies in this product, resulting from the process of automatic delimitation. The present paper analyzes a procedure for revision and correction of the original <b>mask</b> <b>product,</b> identifying the main types of distortion and comparing area differences between original and edited products. The revision procedure was based on visual interpretation and manual digitization of the original <b>mask</b> <b>product,</b> based on three main image sources: the original JERS- 1 high water mosaic, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission global elevation dataset, and a mosaic of orthorectified LandsatTM + images from the GeoCover dataset. The use of two additional sources was invaluable to resolve ambiguities and inconsistencies in areas where JERS- 1 images did not allow clear distinction of wetlands. Considering the first 40 10 x 10 grid cells edited to date, the results show that the difference in area between the original and corrected masks was of approximately 3500 km² (3...|$|R

40|$|Night-time cloud {{detection}} using satellite data is a challenging area of research. This article presents a night-time {{cloud detection}} algorithm based on multispectral thresholds for the Visible and Infrared Radiometer (VIRR). VIRR {{is one of}} the keystone instruments on board the Chinese Feng Yun 3 (FY- 3) polar-orbiting meteorological satellite. In this algorithm, three thermal infrared channels and other ancillary data are used to test for the presence of clouds according to different underlying surface types, and the four levels of possible cloud confidence are used to report whether a pixel is cloudy or clear. This algorithm strengthens the ability of identification of low cloud using the brightness temperature difference between the 3. 7 and 12 m channels. The comparisons of a new cloud mask with the official VIRR cloud <b>mask</b> <b>product</b> and with the official Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud <b>mask</b> <b>product</b> are shown to illustrate and validate the effect of this new algorithm.

This study compares the two existing cloud <b>mask</b> <b>products</b> available for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), stored in the quality layer of the MOD 09 daily surface reflectance <b>product.</b> For both <b>masks,</b> statistics on cloud occurrence are calculated for 1 year of daily surface reflectance data covering the area of southeast Asia. Furthermore, a cloud mask enhancement algorithm is presented for increasing cloud flag reliability by effectively combining the existing cloud labels together with the utilization of annual statistics based on the blue reflectance band. Furthermore, since a lot of compositing algorithms rely on cloud mask information for the filtering of unsuitable observations, the influence of the different cloud masks on 8 -day MOD 09 A 1 composite outputs is examined with respect to data availability and average view angles. The results of the statistical analysis show that the accuracy of the two cloud <b>mask</b> <b>products</b> differs significantly for southeast Asia. Particularly, the radiative influence of land cover proves to strongly affect the reliability of the cloud flags, although to varying degrees throughout the year. The enhancement algorithm successfully identifies undetected clear observations in the original masks while simultaneously setting upper limits for atmospheric contamination.

The cloud conservative nature of the cloud mask algorithm generally results in more cloud obscuration than necessary, relevant to snow identification, which has impacted the ability to map snow extent.

40|$|MODIS land surface {{reflectance}} product (MOD 09) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular data sources for characterizing land surface environments. Because those cloudy observations should be excluded from further analysis, the reliable cloud screening is important for downstream applications. In this paper, an approach is proposed to generate cloud masks from time series of MOD 09 products. It is found that an inflexion point exists between the clear-sky and cloudy observations if time series of reflectances assembled from the same location are sorted. The maximum surface reflectance can be composited from these inflexions and those observations with reflectance values larger than the inflexion are identified as cloudy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to composite the maximum snow-free surface reflectance. And a new method is proposed to objectively compare cloud detection results derived from different approaches. Comparisons show that this inflexion-based cloud detection algorithm performs generally better than the cloud masks accompanying with the MOD 09 products. The new cloud masks are valuable for those applications relying on the MOD 09 products as input and for analysis of the uncertainty of the MODIS cloud <b>mask</b> <b>products.</b> (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Abstract. Masking is {{a popular}} {{countermeasure}} against side channel attacks. Many practical works use Boolean masking because of its sim-plicity, ease of implementation and comparably low performance over-head. Some recent works have explored masking schemes with higher algebraic complexity and have shown that they provide more security than Boolean masking {{at the cost of}} higher overheads. In particular, masking based on the inner product was shown to be practical, albeit not efficient, for a small security parameter, {{and at the same time}} prov-able secure in the domain of leakage resilient cryptography for a large security parameter. In this work we explore a security versus efficiency tradeoff and provide an improved and tweaked inner <b>product</b> <b>masking.</b> Our practical security evaluation shows that it is less secure than the original inner <b>product</b> <b>masking</b> but more secure than Boolean masking.

The MODIS is especially suited for remote sensing of snow cover because of the band coverage over the visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Snow characteris-tically has high reflectance in visible wavelengths and low reflectance in the short-wave infrared at about 1. 6 µm (MODIS band 6), a characteristic that allows for detection of snow by a ratio of a visible band and short-wave infrared band. That characteristic of snow is fairly constant {{over a wide range}} of land surfaces and illumination conditions. However the Aqua MODIS instrument has degraded data quality in band 6; 70 % of the band 6 detectors have been identified as non-functional. The problems with the Aqua MODIS band 6 detectors impact the quality of the Aqua MODIS Level 2 snow data product MYD 10 _L 2, by degrading the quality of the data and through impact to the MODIS cloud <b>mask</b> <b>product</b> that also uses band 6. Because of the band 6 non-functional detector problems an Aqua-specific algorithm using band 7, 2. 1 µm, in place of band 6 was developed and is used to map snow. Snow has similar reflectance in bands 6 and 7. SNOW ALGORITHM SYNOPSI...|$|R
