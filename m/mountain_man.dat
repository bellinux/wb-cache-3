5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Table Rock area for at least 15,000years, based on the age of Clovis points that were {{discovered}} nearby. The region surrounding the Table Rocks was home to the Takelma people. They gathered food such as acorns and tarweed seeds, and caught salmon in the nearby Rogue River. The Takelma also used deer hides for clothing. They had several names for the rocks, including Di'tani ("rock above"), Titanakh ("little Indian plums"), and possibly Kwenphunkh. The first use of the names Upper Table Rock and Lower Table Rock is unknown, however the first recorded use was by <b>mountain</b> <b>man</b> James Clyman in 1845.|$|E

Gulab takes Luttrell into his care, returning to his village, where he attempts to hide Luttrell in his home. Gulab then sends a <b>mountain</b> <b>man</b> to the nearest American air base to alert military forces to Luttrell's location. The Taliban fighters arrive at the village to capture and kill Luttrell, but Gulab and the villagers intervene, threatening to kill the fighters if they harm Luttrell. The fighters leave, but later return to punish the villagers for protecting Luttrell. Gulab and his fellow militia are able to fend off several fighters during the ensuing attack. American forces, arriving via helicopters, shatter the advancing Taliban and, in the process, kill {{the bulk of the}} insurgents with concentrated weaponry fire. The American forces evacuate Luttrell back to base.|$|E

40|$|In the mid- 1820 s, Anglo-American fur trappers, {{known as}} 2 ̆ 2 <b>mountain</b> <b>men,</b> 2 ̆ 2 entered Arizona and began {{trapping}} beaver (Castor canadensis). In Arizona {{there have been}} a number of famous <b>mountain</b> <b>men</b> such as Sylvester and James Pattie, Ewing Young, Jededia Smith, and Bill Williams who trapped along the waterways in northern and southern Arizona. Although the heyday of <b>mountain</b> <b>men</b> lasted only a few decades due to a population decline of beaver, management of these animals continues to this day. The purpose of managing beavers shifted from monetary gain to controlling wildlife damage. During the late 1900 s, beaver were still widely distributed in limited numbers throughout much of the state. We provide a historical overview of beaver management in Arizona with emphasis on the <b>mountain</b> <b>men,</b> recreational trapping, wildlife damage management, and beaver research in Arizona...|$|R

In 1987, he {{directed}} Hawken's Breed, a Western film starring Peter Fonda as a drifter who meets and rescues a young Shawnee woman. While shooting that film, Pierce met the woman who became his second wife, Beth Pulley. In 1996, he directed Renfroe's White Christmas, an adaptation of the classic children's book Renfroe's Christmas. Starting in 1997, he began production on his western film Chasing the Wind (1998), a gritty epic about a <b>mountain</b> <b>man.</b> It proved to be Pierce's final directorial effort, although he continued working as a set decorator for several television shows including MacGyver, Remington Steele, The Twilight Zone and Fresno, a Carol Burnett miniseries parodying prime time soap operas. Pierce's work on the latter show earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Art Direction for a Miniseries or a Special.|$|E

Kristoff, believing that a romantic kiss from Hans will heal her, takes Anna back to the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|John Colter {{is widely}} {{considered}} the first <b>mountain</b> <b>man</b> and, like those that came to the Jackson Hole region over the next 30years, he was there primarily for the profitable fur trapping; the region was rich with the highly sought after pelts of beaver and other fur bearing animals. Between 1810 and 1812, the Astorians traveled through Jackson Hole and crossed Teton Pass as they headed east in 1812. After 1810, American and British fur trading companies were in competition {{for control of the}} North American fur trade, and American sovereignty over the region was not secured until the signing of the Oregon Treaty in 1846. One party employed by the British North West Company and led by explorer Donald Mackenzie entered Jackson Hole from the west in 1818 or 1819. The Tetons, as well as the valley west of the Teton Range known today as Pierre's Hole, may have been named by French speaking Iroquois or French Canadian trappers that were part of Mackenzie's party. Earlier parties had referred to the most prominent peaks of the Teton Range as the Pilot Knobs. The French trappers' les trois tétons (the three breasts) was later shortened to the Tetons.|$|E

5|$|The first U.S. Government {{sponsored}} {{expedition to}} enter Jackson Hole was the 1859–60 Raynolds Expedition. Led by U.S. Army Captain William F. Raynolds and guided by <b>mountain</b> <b>man</b> Jim Bridger, it included naturalist F. V. Hayden, who later led other expeditions to the region. The expedition {{had been charged}} with exploring the Yellowstone region, but encountered difficulties crossing mountain passes due to snow. Bridger ended up guiding the expedition south over Union Pass then following the Gros Ventre River drainage to the Snake River and leaving the region over Teton Pass. Organized exploration of the region was halted during the American Civil War but resumed when F. V. Hayden led the well-funded Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. In 1872, Hayden oversaw explorations in Yellowstone, while a branch of his expedition known as the Snake River Division was led by James Stevenson and explored the Teton region. Along with Stevenson was photographer William Henry Jackson who took the first photographs of the Teton Range. The Hayden Geological Survey named many of the mountains and lakes in the region. The explorations by early mountain men and subsequent expeditions failed to identify any sources of economically viable mineral wealth. Nevertheless, small groups of prospectors set up claims and mining operations on several of the creeks and rivers. By 1900 all organized efforts to retrieve minerals had been abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Travels by fur trappers and adventurers, such as Manuel Lisa and Jim Bridger from 1807 to 1840, {{completed}} {{the exploration of}} the region. With the decline of the fur trade in the late 1840s and much of the prized beaver long since made scarce by over-trapping, few white explorers entered the forest over the next few decades. The first federally financed expedition which passed through portions of Shoshone National Forest was the Raynolds Expedition of 1860, led by topographical engineer Captain William F. Raynolds. The expedition included geologist and naturalist Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden and was guided by <b>mountain</b> <b>man</b> Jim Bridger. Though the Raynolds Expedition was focused on exploration of the Yellowstone region, several efforts to enter what later became Yellowstone National Park were impeded by heavy snows across the mountain passes such as Two Ocean Pass. The expedition finally crossed the northern Wind River Range at a pass they named Union Pass and entered Jackson Hole valley to the south of Yellowstone. Hayden led another expedition through the region in 1871. Hayden was primarily interested in documenting the Yellowstone country west of the forest, but his expedition also established that the forest was a prime resource that merited protection. Travels in the forest in the 1880s by later U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who was also a strong advocate of land conservation, as well as by General Philip Sheridan, provided the impetus that subsequently established the Yellowstone Timberland Reserve in 1891, creating the first national forest in the U.S.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>men</b> {{were most}} common in the North American Rocky Mountains from about 1810 through to the 1880s (with a peak {{population}} in the early 1840s).

50|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>men</b> were ethnically, socially, and religiously diverse, fitting no ready stereotype.

Most <b>mountain</b> <b>men</b> were born in Canada, the United States, or in Spanish-governed Mexican territories, although some European immigrants also moved west in search of financial opportunity, and the French and British both had long-standing active fur-trading industries in Canada. Like any businessmen, <b>mountain</b> <b>men</b> were primarily motivated by profit, trading with Native Americans, trapping for beaver and other skins, and selling the skins, although some few {{were more interested in}} exploring the West and traded solely to support their passion. As such, most of them were part trader, part explorer, part exploiter, part trapper, part teamster and part settler; some were also farmers or occasional (army) hired scouts; and most survived by having good relations with one or more native tribes, and so were multilingual out of necessity. They quite frequently lived part of the year (mainly winters) with Amerindians, and often took Native American wives in the normal course of human events.|$|R
