5|$|Presently {{the only}} major streams {{entering}} the basin come from <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west and northwest, but during the Pleistocene they likely transported more water. When lower sea levels entrenched a more southerly course of the Colorado River, Lake Cahuilla may have been nourished solely by local runoff during the Wisconsin glaciation.|$|E
5|$|The Siberian accentor breeds in a belt across {{northern}} Russia {{east from}} {{just west of}} the Ural <b>Mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pacific coast, with a second, more fragmented, band across southern Siberia. It is migratory, wintering in east China and Korea. It is only rarely recorded in Japan in winter.|$|E

5|$|A mile {{south of}} the airport, at a signalized {{intersection}} with Old State Route 82, the road divides. Highway 82 turns eastward again, returning to its southerly heading after another mile when Spring Valley Road turns off to the Glenwood Springs campus of Colorado Mountain College in the <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. A half-mile (1km) beyond that junction, {{at the headquarters of}} the Garfield County Road and Bridge District, the highway begins a long stretch with a southerly heading.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1860s, when {{settlers}} began exploring {{for gold}} in the area, the Yavapai occupied an area of approximately 20,000mi² (51800km²) bordering the San Francisco Peaks to the north, the Pinaleno Mountains and Mazatzal <b>Mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast, and the Colorado River to the west, and almost to the Gila River and the Salt River to the south.|$|E
5|$|Burns is {{in southeastern}} Oregon near the {{northern}} edge of the arid Harney Basin. The basin is part of the High Lava Plains, a region dominated by erupting volcanoes in the late Miocene, five to ten million years ago. Centered on the Brothers Fault Zone, which runs southeast–northwest between Steens Mountain and Bend, the High Lava Plains merge with the Blue <b>Mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and the Basin and Range Province to the south.|$|E

Hidden Lake is a popular day hike destination with the Hidden Lake overlook a 1.5 mi hike from Logan Pass and the lakeshore adding another 1.5 mi one way.|$|R
5|$|In August the UN {{also began}} using Korean civilians with A-frames as cargo {{carriers}} to move supplies {{up through the}} <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front lines. This method of transport proved both cheaper and more efficient than using pack animals. American units obtained the civilian carriers through arrangements with the ROK Army. Soon the American divisions were using Korean labor for nearly all unskilled work, {{at an average of}} about 500 laborers and carriers to a division.|$|E
5|$|Older {{and more}} deeply eroded, the Western Cascades are {{a range of}} volcanoes lying west of and merging with the High Cascades. They consist of partly altered {{volcanic}} rock from vents in both volcanic provinces, including varied lavas and ash tuffs {{ranging in age from}} 0 to 40million years. As the Cascades rose, the Rogue maintained its flow to the ocean by down-cutting, which created steep narrow gorges and rapids in many places. Bear Creek, a Rogue tributary that flows south to north, marks the boundary between the Western Cascades to the east and the Klamath <b>Mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west.|$|E
5|$|On May31, 2013, a {{prominent}} mid-to-upper level trough and closed mid-level {{low pressure area}} moved east-northeastward, with a lead upper low pivoting over the Dakotas and Upper Midwest region. A moderately strong polar jet moved east-northeastward over the southern Rocky <b>Mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southern Great Plains. With a broad influence of moderately strong cyclonic flow aloft, the air mass was expected to become unstable {{across much of the}} southern Great Plains, through the Upper Midwest and Mississippi Valley, by the afternoon.|$|E
50|$|As the Potomac River {{approaches}} the Blue Ridge {{on the eastern}} edge of the Shenandoah Valley, <b>the</b> river turns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south paralleling <b>the</b> ridge <b>to</b> Bolivar, West Virginia, where it then cuts east, past Harpers Ferry to its confluence with the Shenandoah River at the western edge of the first gap between Blue Ridge <b>Mountain</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south in Virginia and West Virginia and Elk Ridge <b>Mountain</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north in Maryland.

5|$|Plans to {{construct}} a road from Brawley to Glamis date from 1953; the road would provide improved access to two newer state parks. The ceding of the Chocolate <b>Mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Navy had closed a north–south road traversing Imperial County, and the government needed to restore a corridor for local residents to use, as the road was closed during the day for five days a week. However, in August, the Riverside Chamber of Commerce opposed the construction, even though it would replace the Niland–Blythe road. The chamber reversed its stance in December, as the road would mostly be constructed in Imperial County.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} the Itcha Range is {{influenced}} by the presence of the Coast <b>Mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the Coast Mountains before reaching the Interior Plateau, casting a rain shadow over the Itcha Range.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} in 1987 of a primitive tomb at Mondeval de Sora {{high up in}} the <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of Cortina testifies to the presence of Mesolithic man in the area {{as far back as the}} 6th millennium B.C. In the 6th century B.C., Etruscan writing was introduced in the province of Cadore, in whose possession is remained until the early 15th century. From the 3rd century B.C., the Romans assimilated the Veneti people, giving the area the name of Amplitium (from amplus meaning wide), today's Ampezzo.|$|E

5|$|The land {{on which}} Worlds End State Park sits has {{undergone}} tremendous change over the last 350million years. It was once part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion {{of what is now}} North America. The high <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found today in the Loyalsock Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, conglomerates, coal, and limestone.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{exposed in}} the park were formed between 370and 340million years ago, when the land {{was part of the}} {{coastline}} of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found {{in the park}} and in the Kitchen Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, siltstone, and conglomerates.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{exposed in}} the park were formed in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods between 370and 340million years ago, when the land {{was part of the}} {{coastline}} of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America.

50|$|Coker Creek {{lies in the}} {{southern}} Appalachian Mountains (specifically, the Unicoi Mountains) completely surrounded by the Cherokee National Forest, and {{just west of the}} Tennessee-North Carolina state line. Tellico <b>Mountain</b> lies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, Farner <b>Mountain</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, Unicoi <b>Mountain</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, and Cataska <b>Mountain</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. There are homes and businesses, 11 grave yards, 9 churches, and many hiking trails and artisan shops. It is also home to a recreational retreat, Coker Creek Village. The area is known for its trout fishing and the mountains are laced with rhododendron, laurel, ferns and the many species of trees native to this area. Gold was discovered here long before the California 49ers headed west.|$|R

5|$|The {{villages in}} the <b>mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, west, and north of the Salmas Plain were {{generally}} smaller, and accounted for {{about half of the}} total number of villages that were lost. The foreshock was not felt at Borusliqalan (the westernmost village that was destroyed) and the losses were high. The foreshock was also not strongly felt to the east of Lake Urmia (and to the southwest of Tabriz) where the village of Mamaqan was completely destroyed and 85 people were killed. Other nearby villages went almost unscathed, with the differing amounts of damage being attributed to soil type.|$|E
5|$|Although European foxes were {{introduced}} to portions of the United States in the 1900s recent genetic investigation indicates an absence of European fox haplotypes in any North American populations. Also, introduced eastern red foxes have colonized southern California, the San Joaquin Valley, and San Francisco Bay Area, but appear to have mixed with the Sacramento Valley red fox V.v.patwin only in a narrow hybrid zone. In addition, no evidence is seen of interbreeding of eastern red foxes in California with the montane Sierra Nevada red fox V.v.necator or other populations in the Intermountain West (between the Rocky <b>Mountains</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east and the Cascade and Sierra Nevada ranges to the west.|$|E
5|$|Although {{part of the}} Los Angeles {{metropolitan}} area, {{the university}} is {{in close proximity to}} two other large metropolitan and culturally-defined regions, the Inland Empire and Orange County.
