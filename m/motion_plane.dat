40|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{governing equations}} controlling the coupled electromagnetics and acous-tics of porous media are numerically solved {{for the case}} of a layered poro-elastic medium. It is shown that these coupled equations decouple into two equation sets describing two uncoupled wavefield pictures. That is, the PSVTM picture where the compressional and vertical polarized mechanical waves drive currents in the P SV particle <b>motion</b> <b>plane</b> that couples to the electromagnetic wavefield components of the T M mode. And the SHTE picture where the horizontal polarized rotational mechanical waves drive cur-rents in the SH particle <b>motion</b> <b>plane</b> that couples to the electromagnetic wavefield components of the T E mode. The global matrix method is employed in computing electroseismograms in layered poro-elastic media in the PSVTM picture. The principal features of the converted electromagnetic signals are the following: (1) contacts all antennas at approximately the same time; (2) arrives at the antennas at half of the seismic traveltime at normal incidence reflected P waves; and (3) changes sign {{on opposite sides of the}} shot. The seismic pulse is shown to induce electric fields that travel with the compressional wavespeed and magnetic fields that travel with the rotational wavefield. The frequency content of the converted electromagnetic field has the same frequency content of the driving incident seismic pulse, as long as the propagation distances are much less than the electromagnetic skin depth. Snapshots in time and converted electromagnetic amplitudes versus seismic point source-antenna offset-are calculated for contrasts in mechanical and/or electrical medium property. Conversion happens there where the seismic wavefront passes a contrast in medium properties due to generated imbalances in current across the contrast.

Developed was a facility, which determines under application of each two perpendicularly arranged slit apertures and profile grids and a multichannel current-amplifier plug-in both beam profile and beam emittance of the two transverse <b>motion</b> <b>planes.</b> After the determination of the 1 - and 2 -dimensional phase-space distributions was successfully realized, the facility was further developed for the measurement of the 3 -dimensional phase-space distributions. The observed growth of the emittance and RMS growth on magnetic solenoids could be quantitatively determined and their different causes determined. The growth factors of an optically only slightly filamented beam emittance between 1. 5 and 3. 2 show that the beam quality is strongly interfered by such influences. The measurements showed beyond the causes and the connection between the filamentation of the emittance as well as the origin of the hollow beams and beam halos observed in many experiments. It could be shown that not only magnetic fields and space-charge fields but pricipally each radial-symmetric, nonlinear field couples the two transverse <b>motion</b> <b>planes</b> and by this causes in nearly all cases a growth of the beam emittanceSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: RA 3692 (93 - 43) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekDEGerman...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{kinematic}} approach for tracked mobile robots in order to improve motion control and pose estimation. Complex dynamics due to slippage and track–soil interactions make it difficult to predict the exact motion of the vehicle on the basis of track velocities. Nevertheless, real-time computations for autonomous navigation require an effective kinematics approximation without introducing dynamics in the loop. The proposed solution is {{based on the fact that}} the instantaneous centers of rotation (ICRs) of treads on the <b>motion</b> <b>plane</b> with respect to the vehicle are dynamics-dependent, but they lie within a bounded area. Thus, optimizing constant ICR positions for a particular terrain results in an approximate kinematic model for tracked mobile robots.
