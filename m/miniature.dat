5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of <b>Miniature</b> Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, <b>Miniature</b> Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. <b>Miniature</b> Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. <b>Miniature</b> Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. <b>Miniature</b> Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|E

5000|$|Jonathan Tweet {{explained}} the initial goal behind the book: [...] "The <b>Miniatures</b> Handbook and the D&D <b>Miniatures</b> line in general developed because {{we saw that}} <b>miniatures</b> were {{a big part of}} the D&D roleplaying experience. We wanted to support players who use <b>miniatures</b> in their games, as well as create easy-to-use <b>miniatures</b> for players who would like to use <b>miniatures</b> but don't. In addition, we built on the experience Wizards has with competitive games. Our D&D <b>miniatures</b> are designed to work in a roleplaying game, but we've also created a head-to-head skirmish system for fighting fast, tactical battles with them. The <b>Miniatures</b> Handbook, like the <b>miniatures</b> themselves, supports both roleplaying and head-to-head wargaming." ...|$|R

5|$|The AKC {{accepted}} {{registration of}} the new breed in 1926, two years after <b>Miniature</b> Schnauzers {{were introduced to the}} United States. They were originally known as Wirehaired Pinschers. International Kennel Club classifications vary; in the United Kingdom and Australia they fall within the Utility Group, while in Canada they are in the Working Group. In the AKC the <b>Miniature</b> Schnauzer is classed with the terriers. It was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1948 and also classed as a terrier. The start of the modern <b>Miniature</b> Schnauzer is generally considered to begin with Ch. Dorem Display, the first <b>Miniature</b> Schnauzer to win Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. He was born 5 April 1945 and lived to be nearly fourteen. Almost every living <b>Miniature</b> Schnauzer in America can trace its lineage back to Dorem Display.|$|E
5|$|The {{preliminary}} matter is introduced by an iconic {{image of the}} Virgin and Child (folio 7v). This <b>miniature</b> is the first representation of the Virgin in a Western manuscript.

5000|$|In 2012, Wizards of the Coast {{released}} Dungeon Command, {{the successor}} to the D&D <b>Miniatures</b> skirmish game.

Dungeon Command components are sold in [...] "faction packs" [...] that include <b>miniatures,</b> map tiles, and statistics cards for both Dungeon Command and Wizards' Adventure System line of games. As of March 2013, Wizards had released five Dungeon Command faction packs; the majority of <b>miniatures</b> used in these faction packs are reissued models from earlier D&D <b>Miniatures</b> sets, though the fifth featured all new <b>miniatures.</b> Stats for all new sculpts were released by the DDM Guild on their website, and thus all Dungeon Command <b>miniatures</b> are legal for Dungeons & Dragons <b>Miniatures</b> play.|$|R

5|$|Neither USB 1.0 nor 1.1 {{specified}} {{a design}} for any connector {{smaller than the}} standard type A or type B. Though many designs for a miniaturised type B connector appeared on many peripheral devices, conformance to the USB 1.x standard was fudged by treating peripherals that had <b>miniature</b> connectors {{as though they had}} a tethered connection (that is: no plug or socket at the peripheral end). There was no known <b>miniature</b> type A connector until USB 2.0 (rev 1.01) introduced one.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} records surrounding {{development of}} the Standard Schnauzer in Germany come from the late 19th century. They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to ratting, herding, and guarding property. As time passed, farmers bred the Standard Schnauzer into a smaller, more compact size for ratting by combining it with the Affenpinscher and <b>Miniature</b> Poodle. The first recorded <b>Miniature</b> Schnauzer appeared in 1888, and the first exhibition was held in 1899.|$|E
