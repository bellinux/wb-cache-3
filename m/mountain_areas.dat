5|$|Alpine {{symbolism}} {{has played}} {{an essential role}} in shaping {{the history of the country}} and the Swiss national identity. Nowadays some concentrated <b>mountain</b> <b>areas</b> have a strong highly energetic ski resort culture in winter, and a hiking (ger: das Wandern) or Mountain biking culture in summer. Other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture that caters to tourism, yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors. A traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the cities. Folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country. In Switzerland it is mostly expressed in music, dance, poetry, wood carving and embroidery. The alphorn, a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood, has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of traditional Swiss music.|$|E
5|$|Cacti inhabit diverse regions, from coastal plains to high <b>mountain</b> <b>areas.</b> With one exception, {{they are}} {{native to the}} Americas, where their range extends from Patagonia to British Columbia and Alberta in western Canada. A number of centers of {{diversity}} exist. For cacti adapted to drought, the three main centers are Mexico and the southwestern United States; the southwestern Andes, where they are found in Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina; and eastern Brazil, away from the Amazon Basin. Tree-living epiphytic and climbing cacti necessarily have different centers of diversity, as they require moister environments. They are mainly found in the coastal mountains and Atlantic forests of southeastern Brazil; in Bolivia, which {{is the center of}} diversity for the subfamily Rhipsalideae; and in forested regions of Central America, where the climbing Hylocereeae are most diverse.|$|E
