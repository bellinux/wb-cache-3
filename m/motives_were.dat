5|$|On December 8, 1980, Mark David Chapman {{shocked the}} world by murdering 40-year-old {{musician}} and activist, John Lennon, outside The Dakota, his New York apartment building. Chapman's <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> fabricated from pure delusion, fueled by an obsession with the fictional character Holden Caulfield and his similar misadventures in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. In one instant, an anonymous, socially awkward and mentally unstable 25-year-old fan of The Beatles, who had fluctuated between idealizing Lennon and being overcome {{with a desire to}} kill him, altered the course of the history of music.|$|E
5|$|Davidson's later {{career as}} a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His {{attempts}} at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles {{that he had not}} been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> genuine and that he did not deserve the humiliations he endured.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} ways a defendants <b>motive</b> can <b>be</b> pertinent {{to his or}} her criminal liability. <b>Motive</b> can <b>be</b> fully inculpatory or exculpatory or only partially inculpatory or exculpatory. When one has acted with a specific motive, lawful behavior becomes illegal, and this <b>is</b> when <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> fully inculpatory. If illegal activity with a particular motive does not hold a defendant responsible than that <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> fully exculpatory. When a motive supplies inadequate defense to a crime, the <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> partially exculpatory. When a motive says the kind of infraction for which the defendant <b>is</b> responsible, the <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> partially inculpatory.|$|R
5|$|In July 2011 Austrian pastafarian Niko Alm won {{the legal}} right to be shown in his driving license photo wearing a pasta {{strainer}} on his head, after three years spent pursuing permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive. He got the idea after reading that Austrian regulations allow headgear in official photos only when it is worn for religious reasons. Some sources report that the colander in the form of pasta strainer, was recognised by Austrian authorities as a religious headgear of the parody religion Pastafarianism in 2011. This was denied by Austrian authorities, saying that religious <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> not the reason to grant the permission of wearing the headgear in a passport.|$|E
5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry {{about the fact that he}} had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that he was going to make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> vague, and that they had no idea of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
5|$|Ex-Confederates {{were usually}} a safe voting bloc for the Democrats, {{but many of}} them deserted Goebel because he had, in 1895, {{approached}} and quickly killed his main local political opponent, the grandson of Revolutionary War General and US Congressman Thomas Sandford, the esteemed banker and former Confederate colonel John Sandford, in what he declared was an act of self-defense. On the other hand, blacks had historically been a safe bloc for the Republicans, but Taylor had alienated many of them by not strongly opposing the Separate Coach Bill, which would have racially segregated railroad facilities. Goebel also risked losing support to minor party candidates. Besides John Y. Brown, the dissenting Democrats' nominee, the Populist Party nominated a candidate, drawing votes from Goebel's populist base. To unite his traditional base, Goebel convinced William Jennings Bryan, a hero to most populists and Democrats, to campaign for him. As soon as Bryan finished his tour of the state, Governor Bradley reversed course and began speaking in favor of Taylor. While Bradley insisted that his <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> to defend his administration, journalist Henry Watterson believed Taylor had promised to support Bradley's senatorial bid if elected.|$|E

5000|$|A motive, in law, {{especially}} criminal law, is {{the cause}} that moves people to induce a certain action. [...] <b>Motive,</b> in itself, <b>is</b> not an element of any given crime; however, the legal system typically allows <b>motive</b> to <b>be</b> proven {{in order to make}} plausible the accused's reasons for committing a crime, at least when those <b>motives</b> may <b>be</b> obscure or hard to identify with. However, a <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> not required to reach a verdict. <b>Motives</b> <b>are</b> also used in other aspects of a specific case, for instance, when police are initially investigating.|$|R
5|$|Perhaps {{as early}} as 786 the {{creation}} of a Mercian archbishopric was being discussed at Offa's court. A letter to the papacy written by Coenwulf, who succeeded Offa's son Ecgfrith to the Mercian throne, claimed that Offa's <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> his dislike of Jænberht, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and of the men of Kent. At the Council of Chelsea held in 787, Offa secured {{the creation of a}}n archbishopric for his kingdom centred on the diocese of Lichfield (in modern Staffordshire). Offa may have justified the move by suggesting that Jænberht planned to allow the Frankish king Charlemagne to use a landing site in Kent if the latter decided to invade, although this is only known from a 13th-century writer, Matthew Paris. Another concern was probably that of prestige, as having the main Mercian diocese held by an archbishop rather than a bishop would increase the kingdom's status.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, {{and his wife}} Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, occurred on 28 June 1914 in Sarajevo when they were mortally wounded by Gavrilo Princip. Princip {{was one of a}} group of six assassins (five Serbs and one Bosniak) coordinated by Danilo Ilić, a Bosnian Serb and a member of the Black Hand secret society. The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's South Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Yugoslavia. The assassins' <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia. The assassination led directly to the First World War when Austria-Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia, which was partially rejected. Austria-Hungary then declared war, triggering actions leading to war between most European states.|$|E

40|$|Extract:Motive can {{be defined}} as the emotional, psychological, and {{material}} needs that impel and are satisfied by behavior. In a criminal prosecution, the determination of <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> not necessary. Yet, while this is a legal reality, the failure to make the determination of <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> a significant investigative shortcoming, and any investigation that has failed to yield the motive behind the crime is subsequently incomplete. Determinations of <b>motive</b> <b>are</b> not made directly, as {{it is not possible to}} read the mind of any criminal. Nor are confessions regarding motivation reliable without corroboration. This <b>is</b> because <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> not always the product of deliberate thought; they can subconscious and therefore not directly perceived or understood by those experiencing them...|$|R

The custom of burying female infants alive, comments a noted Qur'anic commentator, Muhammad Asad, seems to have been fairly widespread in pre-Islamic Arabia.

25|$|Advice in 1945 when Hitler asked Dönitz {{whether the}} Geneva Convention should be denounced. Hitler's <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> twofold. The first was that {{reprisals}} {{could be taken}} against Western Allied prisoners of war; second, it would deter German forces from surrendering to the Western Allies (as was happening on the Eastern Front where the Geneva Convention was in abeyance). Instead of arguing the conventions should never be denounced, Dönitz suggested it was not expedient to do so, so the court found against him on this issue; but as the Convention was not denounced by Germany, and British prisoners in camps under Dönitz's jurisdiction were treated strictly according to the Convention, the Court considered these mitigating circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Kiarostami's {{first film}} of the decade was Close-Up (1990), which narrates {{the story of the}} real-life trial of a man who {{impersonated}} film-maker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, conning a family into believing they would star in his new film. The family suspects theft as the motive for this charade, but the impersonator, Hossein Sabzian, argues that his <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> more complex. The part-documentary, part-staged film examines Sabzian's moral justification for usurping Makhmalbaf's identity, questioning his ability to sense his cultural and artistic flair. Ranked #42 in British Film Institute's The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time, Close-Up received praise from directors such as Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Werner Herzog, Jean-Luc Godard, and Nanni Moretti and was released across Europe.|$|E
25|$|In December 2016, {{two senior}} {{intelligence}} officials told U.S. news media {{that they were}} highly confident that Vladimir Putin personally directed the operation to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. They said Putin's <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> a vendetta against Hillary Clinton {{and the desire to}} foment global distrust of the U.S. Putin became personally involved after Russia accessed the DNC, because such an operation required high government approval. U.S. officials said that under Putin's direction, the goals evolved from criticizing American democracy to attacking Clinton, and by the fall of 2016 to directly help Trump's campaign, because Putin thought he would ease economic sanctions. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest and Obama foreign policy advisor and speechwriter Ben Rhodes agreed with this assessment, with Rhodes saying operations of this magnitude required Putin's consent.|$|E
