To help deliver on this target world leaders established <b>Mission</b> <b>Innovation</b> (MI), an agreement between 21 regions to double their public ‘clean energy’ research and development (R&D) investment by 2021. Through international collaboration and coordination MI aims to usher in the next generation of clean energy technologies capable of mitigating catastrophic climate change. Whilst it represents a timely and much-need initiative MI is still at an early stage and faces a number of important challenges that policy makers need to address {{if it is to be}} a success. First, a doubling of clean energy R&D investment within 5 years during a period of declining R&D public investment represents an unprecedented challenge. Its success will rely on MI members sharing best-practice in energy innovation policy to ensure not only that this increase is achieved but that it is delivered effectively, leading to high-quality innovation outputs. Second, the political credibility and durability of anon-legally binding scheme is questionable when it demands all countries to double their total clean energy R&D investment despite some already committing significantly more investment as a proportion of their wealth than others (i. e. $ R&D per GDP). Third, a clear enabling framework must make clear the scale and type of benefit each MI member will receive as proportion of their investment from multi-partner international R&D collaboration. Fourth, a combination of international and cross-sectoral coordination of R&D investment is critical to ensuring a balanced distribution of investment across different clean energy priorities and stages of innovation. Fifth, MI members need to carefully consider the carbon emissions reduction potential of their increased energy R&D investment in each priority area and how together these activities will contribute to a 2 oC future.   Taking these recommendations into account will undoubtedly help transform the ground-breaking <b>Mission</b> <b>Innovation</b> from Mission Impossible to Mission Accomplished...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{requirement of}} therapeutics for extended duration exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit {{will be the}} development of pharmaceutical technologies suitable for sustained and preventive health care in remote and adverse environmental conditions. Availability of sustained, stable and targeted delivery pharmaceuticals for preventive health of major organ systems including gastrointestinal, hepato-renal, musculo-skeletal and immune function are essential to offset adverse effects of space environment beyond low Earth orbit. Specifically, medical needs may include multi-drug combinations for hormone replacement, radiation protection, immune enhancement and organ function restoration. Additionally, extended stability of pharmaceuticals dispensed in space must be also considered in future drug development. Emerging technologies that can deliver stable and multi-therapy pharmaceutical preparations and delivery systems include nanotechnology based drug delivery platforms, targeted-delivery systems in non-oral and non-parenteral formulation matrices. Synthetic nanomaterials designed with molecular precision offer defined structures, electronics, and chemistries to be efficient drug carriers with clear advantages over conventional materials of drug delivery matricies. Nano-carrier materials like the bottle brush polymers may be suitable for systemic delivery of drug cocktails while Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles or (SPIONS) have great potential to serve as carriers for targeted drug delivery to a specific site.

40|$|When NASA designs a {{spacecraft}} {{to undertake a}} new <b>mission,</b> <b>innovation</b> does not stop after the design phase. In many cases, these spacecraft are firsts of their kind, requiring not only remarkable imagination and expertise in their conception but new technologies and methods for their manufacture. In the realm of manufacturing, NASA has from necessity worked on the cutting-edge, seeking new techniques and materials for creating unprecedented structures, as well as capabilities for reducing the cost and increasing the efficiency of existing manufacturing technologies. From friction stir welding enhancements (Spinoff 2009) to thermoset composites (Spinoff 2011), NASA s innovations in manufacturing have often transferred {{to the public in}} ways that enable the expansion of the Nation s industrial productivity. NASA has long pursued ways of improving upon and ensuring quality results from manufacturing processes ranging from arc welding to thermal coating applications. But many of these processes generate blinding light (hence the need for special eyewear during welding) that obscures the process while it is happening, making it difficult to monitor and evaluate. In the 1980 s, NASA partnered with a company to develop technology to address this issue. Today, that collaboration has spawned multiple commercial products that not only support effective manufacturing for private industry but also may support NASA in the use of an exciting, rapidly growing field of manufacturing ideal for long-duration space missions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} keep global {{temperature}} rise well below 2 °C {{as set out in}} the Paris Agreement, efforts must accelerate to enable the further development and deployment of CO 2 Capture and Storage. CCS is one of the 7 challenges of <b>Mission</b> <b>Innovation,</b> one of the 10 key actions of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan and, in France, is part of the National Strategy for Energy Research. According to previous studies, France would need to store 1 Gt of CO 2 over the 2020 - 2050 period. Studies of the Paris, Aquitaine and SouthEast basins have shown that they offer sufficient CO 2 storage potential. In the Paris basin, several structures with storage capacities of 50 - 100 Mt CO 2 were assessed through dynamic calculations. In the Aquitaine basin, a CCS pilot operated by TOTAL injected 51 Kt of CO 2 into a depleted gas field. In the SouthEast basin, natural CO 2 occurences have been studied and a feasibility study for CCUS in the industrial area of Fos-Marseille was performed. Complementary to the 'classic' way of storing CO 2 in supercritical form, an innovative 'CO 2 -Dissolved' concept of storing CO 2 in dissolved form while extracting geothermal heat is being developed. It is well suited for small industrial CO 2 emitters and local solutions. France is thus investigating three complementary approaches: large storage offshore in the North Sea or Mediterranean Sea (ca. 10 Mt/a), medium storage onshore (ca. 1 Mt/a), and small decentralised storage combined with heat recovery (ca. 80 - 150 kt/a). BRGM is deeply committed to advancing research for enabling CO 2 storage and is currently 1) preparing the ground for an industrial CO 2 -Dissolved pilot, 2) coordinating the H 2020 ENOS research project 'Enabling Onshore CO 2 Storage in Europe', 3) coordinating the French node of the ECCSEL European Research Infrastructure, and 4) carrying out upstream research on site characterization, monitoring, modelling and risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a general}} {{scarcity}} of empirical studies investigating the impact of leadership styles on e-Government use in the service industry. This is doubly true of styles such as transformational, transactional and servant leadership. Theorised models propose that leadership style forms the desired organisational culture for implementing e-services, organisational culture being the mediator and the national culture the moderator. This research fills the empirical gap by investigating how leadership forms the organisational culture that facilitates and enhances the implementation and use of e-government in organisations in Saudi Arabia. The research was conducted through the sampling of employees in private and public sectors. While {{the data for the}} leadership styles, organisational culture and national culture were collected through the use of questionnaires designed for employees, the e-services were measured through organizations’ official websites. All data were processed and analysed using computer software (WarPPLS) and SPSS. The results support the hypothesized relationships proposed in the theoretical model, wherein all constructs under study (except for the mediating effect of National Culture (NC) on the relationship between leadership styles and organisational culture) positively affect e-services implementation, including Individualized Influence (IINF), Intellectual Stimulation (ISTIM), Individualized Support (ISUP), Contingent Reward (CR), Management by Exception (MbE), Servant Leadership (SL), Bureaucratic Culture (BC), Involvement Culture (INVC), Mission Culture (MC), Innovative Culture (INC), Task Culture (TC) and Future Culture (FC) and the mediating effect of National Culture (NC) on the relationship between organisational culture and e-services implementation. The results also indicated that specific leadership styles have direct and positive impacts on e-services implementation and indirect influences through a mediating organisational culture and a moderating national culture. The empirical findings bring new evidence in support of this proposal, indicating that specific leadership styles play crucial roles in influencing processes and outcomes within organizations. According to these results, e-services differ from one organization to another, and these variations were correlated to leadership styles and organizational culture. It was found that there were positive and significant correlations between total leadership styles (hybrid) and total organizational cultures (hybrid) in the full sample and in e-services implementation. E-services implementation increases when the mean for leadership styles rises, but types of organizational culture were also crucial factors in achieving better e-services. The national culture variable, which was used as a moderator, did not have a significant influence on the relationship between leadership style and organisational culture. Therefore, the moderating role of national culture in the relationship between leadership styles and organisational culture did not have any level of statistical significance, which means that regardless of the national culture (power distance or uncertainty avoidance) the effect of leadership style on organisational culture in the model adopted in this study appeared to be quite consistent. The study links theory to practice by explaining the subject of modern leadership styles and shows their relevance to the Saudi organisations and business environment. As such, it opens up a domain for investigating the application of modern management theories in a different culture. Although a plethora of studies have investigated the effect of factors such as organisational culture and/or national culture on e-services implementation in Saudi’s organisations, no study (to the best of this writer's knowledge) has tackled the issue of e-services implementation and leadership styles in those organisations. Therefore, studying e-services implementation and leadership styles in Saudi’s organisations is a contribution to the literature on the service industry, adding to its knowledge with a case study from a different cultural setting. The study also opens up a horizon for future research on developing the business sector, as it uses standardized tools in terms of reliability and validity {{within the context of the}} e-services implementation. Therefore, this study contributes to existing knowledge in that leadership and organisational culture are revealed to be key contributors to e-services implementation. The three leadership styles - transformational, transactional, and servant leadership - were empirically found to be appropriate styles that work well in e-services implementation projects. These styles have direct and positive benefits to e-services implementation and an indirect impact through the mediating means of organisational culture, and empirical findings bring new evidence for this notion. Moreover, the six organisational cultural dimensions were judged to be appropriate supporters of e-services implementation, specifically: involvement, <b>mission,</b> <b>innovation,</b> task-orientation, bureaucracy, and future-orientation...|$|E

40|$|The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is inquiring {{into the}} Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 2015 [2016] ATNIF 31. The Australian Government has {{produced}} a National Interest Analysis [2016] ATNIA 10. Amongst other things, the Paris Agreement 2015 featured significant debate {{over the role of}} technology in respect of addressing climate change. - The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon has commented: ‘Intellectual property, technology transfer, and financing are among a wide range of topics that must be addressed in the context of climate change and sustainable development’. The Paris Climate Talks considered a number of issues related to intellectual property, technology transfer, finance, and climate change. - Draft Article 56. 3 laid down a number of options. The first option suggests a number of possibilities to facilitate technology transfer. Item A suggests that developed countries ‘provide financial resources to address barriers caused by intellectual property rights (IPRs) and facilitate access to and the deployment of technology, including inter alia, by utilizing the Financial Mechanism and/or the establishment of a funding window under the Green Climate Fund / the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism. ’ Item B calls for ‘an international mechanism on IPRs to be established to facilitate access to and the deployment of technology to [developing country Parties]. ’ Item C calls for other arrangements to be established to address intellectual property rights – such as ‘collaborative research and development, shareware, commitments related to humanitarian or preferential licensing, fully paid-up or joint licensing schemes, preferential rates and patent pools. ’ Item D suggests that ‘funds from the Green Climate Fund will be utilized to meet the full costs of intellectual property rights (IPRs) of environmentally sound technologies and know-how and such technologies will be provided to developing country Parties free of cost in order to enhance their actions to address climate change and its adverse impacts. ’ The second option is that ‘Parties recognize that IPRs create an enabling environment for the promotion of technology innovation in environmentally sound technologies. ’ The third option favoured by developed countries is that ‘IPRs are not to be addressed in this agreement. ’ The fourth option is for ‘Developed country Parties to make available Intellectual Property (IP) through multilateral institutions as public good, through purchase of intellectual property. ’ - The final text of the Paris Agreement 2015 avoids dealing with intellectual property and climate change directly. Nonetheless, there are glancing references to traditional knowledge {{in the context of a}} larger debate about Indigenous Knowledge. There is some extensive text, more generally, about technology research, development, and dissemination in the Paris Agreement 2015. At the Paris talks, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi contended that: ‘Our innovation initiative should be driven by public purpose, not just market incentives, including on IP. ’ He emphasized that: ‘We need to scale up the Green Climate Fund that will improve access to technology and intellectual property. ’ For his part, US President Barack Obama flagged that he was willing to engage in a dialogue over matters of technology transfer. The Paris Climate Talks also saw a number of announcements on innovation – including <b>Mission</b> <b>Innovation,</b> the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, and the International Solar Alliance. Recommendations This submission focuses upon issues relating to intellectual property, technology transfer, and innovation in respect of the Paris Agreement 2015. Recommendation 1 Australia should seek to ratify and implement the Paris Agreement 2015. Recommendation 2 There is a need to harmonise the international regimes in respect of intellectual property and climate change, with a joint declaration by key international organisations, such as the UNFCCC, the World Trade Organization, and the World Intellectual Property Organization. Recommendation 3 The Paris Agreement 2015 further consolidates the Technology Mechanism and the Finance Mechanism in the International Climate Framework. Above and beyond the Paris Agreement 2015, there is a need to address intellectual property and climate change in future international climate agreements. An Intellectual Property Mechanism could be a useful addition. Australia should seek to play a stronger role in the Technology Mechanism – the UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network. Recommendation 4 The TRIPS Council has been holding ongoing debates over intellectual property and climate change. There is a need to update the TRIPS Agreement 1994 to better address intellectual property and climate change. Recommendation 5 The World Intellectual Property Organization has considered intellectual property and climate change as part of its agenda to tackle global issues. WIPO GREEN has played a useful technical role. There is a need for the World Intellectual Property Organization to address substantive and procedural issues in respect of intellectual property and clean technologies. Recommendation 6 There is a need for patent regimes to ensure the quality of patent applications, generally. Green patent fast-track systems have been put into place around the world in a variety of patent offices. Professor Eric Lane has recommended the establishment of a Green Patent Highway. Recommendation 7 There has been significant patent litigation in respect of clean technologies. There have been concerns about both infringement of patent rights of innovative clean technology companies; and abuse of the intellectual property rights by patent trolls. There are larger questions about the interaction between patent law and competition policy in the context of clean technologies. Recommendation 8 As a net importer of patented technologies (including clean technologies), there is a need for Australia to make strategic use of patent flexibilities – such as experimental use, public licensing, patent pools, compulsory licensing, and state use. The Productivity Commission has made useful recommendations on how to modernise Australia’s patent regime. Recommendation 9 The Paris Agreement 2015 further builds upon the Technology Mechanism of the UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network. Australia currently does not play a key role in the Technology Mechanism. Given Australia’s ‘Ideas Boom’ innovation policy, it is important that Australia plays a leadership role in this clean technology network. Australia should also participate in other technology networks announced at the Paris International Climate Talks – including <b>Mission</b> <b>Innovation,</b> the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, and the International Solar Alliance. Recommendation 10 There is a need to further experiment with models of Open Innovation in respect of clean technologies. The Eco-Patent Commons, the Green Xchange, and Elon Musk’s Open Innovation should be emulated in Australia. Recommendation 11 Innovation prizes – such as the L-Prize, the H-Prize and X Prizes – have been a useful means of encouraging research and development in respect of clean technologies. Recommendation 12 From the perspective of Australia, it is daunting that other nations – including the United States, Germany, Nordic countries, Japan, Korea, and China - dominate the patent filings in respect of clean technologies. Australia needs to improve its performance in regard to the research, development, and deployment of renewable energy. The ‘Ideas Boom’ Innovation Policy should address this problem. Recommendation 13 There has been a proliferation of green trade marks and eco-labels. There is a need for transparency, accountability, and legitimacy in terms of the assessment of such marks and labels. Recommendation 14 There is a need for competition and consumer regulators to take action in respect of misleading and deceptive conduct – such as greenwashing, astroturfing, and climate deception. The dispute over VW’s ‘Dieselgate’ is a useful case study in this context. Recommendation 15 Green buildings and designs could be encouraged under the copyright regime and the designs regime. Recommendation 16 The United States and the European Union have been concerned about trade secrets theft in respect of confidential information relating to clean technologies. Recommendation 17 The Obama Administration encouraged scientific agencies like NASA and NOAA to make climate data open and accessible. Recommendation 18 There have been significant interactions in respect of intellectual property, food security, and climate change. Plant breeder’s rights, patents on climate ready-crops, and farmers’ rights have raised interesting questions about ownership and access to clean technologies. Norway’ Svalbard Global Seed Vault – the ‘Doomsday Vault’ – is a Big Science Project designed to provide insurance for plant genetic resources against climate change, natural disasters, and other emergencies. Recommendation 19 There is a need to better align biodiversity conservation efforts and climate action. The principles of access to genetic resources, informed consent, and benefit-sharing could certainly play a role in achieving better outcomes in this field. Recommendation 20 There is a need for better recognition of Indigenous Intellectual Property – including in respect of Indigenous environmental and climate knowledge. Recommendation 21 The Paris Agreement 2015 could be undermined by the use of investor-state dispute settlement against climate action measures (such as for instance, the action by TransCanada against President Barack Obama’s decision to block the Keystone XL Pipeline). Some commentators such as Gus van Harten and Maude Barlow argued that the Paris Agreement 2015 include language to prevent use of investor-state dispute settlement clauses against climate measures. Recommendation 22 There has been concern that the Paris Agreement 2015 could be undermined by the passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership – the Pacific Rim regional trade agreement...|$|E

The high science goals set for the <b>mission</b> require <b>innovations</b> in telescope design. In particular, wide energy band coverage and fine angular resolution require relatively thick coded masks and thick detectors compared to their pixel size, which may introduce mask self-collimation and depth-induced image blurring with conventional design approaches. Previously we proposed relatively simple solutions to these potential problems: radial hole for mask selfcollimation and cathode depth sensing detector for image blurring. We have now performed laboratory experiments to explore the potential of these two techniques. The experimental {{results show that the}} radial hole mask greatly alleviates mask self-collimation and a ~ 1 mm resolution depth-sensitive detector scheme can be relatively easily achieved for the large scale required for EXIST. Comment: 10 pages, 10 figures, appears in the SPIE 2004 proceedings (5540 : Hard X-ray and gamma-ray detector physics V...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} involving radiation-resistant hydrophobic coatings {{is planned}} for space exposure and experimental testing on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2011. The Lotus biocide coatings are designed for supporting space exploration <b>missions.</b> This <b>innovation</b> is an antibacterial, anti-contamination, and self-cleaning coating that uses nano-sized semiconductor semimetal oxides to neutralize biological pathogens and toxic chemicals, {{as well as to}} mitigate dust accumulation (see figure). The Lotus biocide coating is thin (approximately microns thick), lightweight, and the biocide properties will not degrade with time or exposure to biological or chemical agents. The biocide is stimulated chemically (stoichiometric reaction) through exposure to light (photocatalysis), or by an applied electric field (electrocatalysis). The hydrophobic coating samples underwent preliminary high-energy proton and alpha-ray (helium ion) irradiations at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 88 " cyclotron and demonstrated excellent radiation resistance for a portion of the Galactic Cosmic Ray (GRC) and Solar Proton spectrum. The samples will undergo additional post-flight studies when returned to Earth to affirm further the radiation resistance properties of the space exposed coatings...|$|R
40|$|In our <b>mission</b> {{to advance}} <b>innovation</b> by {{industrial}} adoption of academic results, we perform many projects with high-tech industries. Favoring formal methods, we observe {{a gap between}} industrial needs in performance modeling and the analysis capabilities of formal methods for this goal. After clarifying this gap, we highlight some relevant deficiencies for state-of-the-art quantitative analysis techniques (focusing on model checking and simulation). As an ingredient to bridging the gap, we propose to unite domain-specific industrial contexts with academic performance approaches through Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). We illustrate our vision with examples from different high-tech industries and discuss {{lessons learned from the}} migration process of adopting it...|$|R
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis is social {{innovation}} {{and its impact}} on its target group in the context of Czech social economy. Social innovation should represent new and better ways to address social problems. Social innovation can take more forms (new products, services, rules, types of organizations, etc.). There is no one form of social innovation. Even though social innovation can be found in any sector, this thesis considers social economy to be the best environment, where social innovation can strive, because it can use market based mechanism as its social <b>mission.</b> Social <b>innovation</b> used in the research of this work is an example of good practice, from the area of social economy, with lasting impact, which can be studied. The example used in this thesis is the Czechitas Association. In order to understand social innovation phenomena and its impact, this thesis utilizes case study design as a research method. To reach the given goal, the case study uses multiple data sources as documents, interviews and a questionnaire for employees of the association and a questionnaire for the target group. Key words: social innovation, social impact, social value, social economy, social enterprise, Czechita...|$|R
40|$|H ~ {{profession}} {{of social work}} in India isT {{more than thirty years}} old. Yet I am afraid the profession {{does not seem to have}} come of age. Mature thinking, broad perspectives, sobriety born out of the felt responsibilities of work in a problem-ridden society, a sense of identification with progres-sive thought, of belonging to the community and the culture of which it is a part, and a sense of <b>mission</b> and creative <b>innovation</b> in the realms of thought and action- all these are the hall-marks of a mature profession whose clients are human beings- individuals and collectivities. We may scan the social work horizon to discern the evidence of these, but we end up with the vision of a disappoint...|$|R
40|$|The {{long history}} of space flight {{includes}} missions that used Space Nuclear Auxiliary Power devices, starting with the Transit 4 A Spacecraft (1961), continuing through the Apollo, Pioneer, Viking, Voyager, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Pathfinder, and most recently, Cassini (1997). All Major Radiological Source (MRS) missions were processed at Kennedy Space Center/Cape Canaveral Air Station (KSC/CCAS) Launch Site in full compliance with program and regulatory requirements. The cumulative experience gained supporting these past missions has led to significant innovations which will be useful for benchmarking future MRS <b>mission</b> ground processing. <b>Innovations</b> developed during ground support for the Cassini mission include official declaration of sealed-source classifications, utilization of a mobile analytical laboratory, employment of a computerized dosimetry record management system, and cross-utilization of personnel from related disciplines...|$|R
