25|$|Starting {{point for}} the {{synthesis}} of ring A was methoxydimethylindol 3 synthesised by condensation of the Schiff base from m-anisidine 1 and acetoin 2. Reaction with the Grignard reagent of propargyl iodide 4 give the propargyl indolenine 5 and ring-closure to 7 was brought about by boron trifluoride and <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> in methanol through intermediate 6 (electrophilic addition) with the two methyl groups forced into a cis-relationship.|$|E
500|$|Oxygen {{was first}} {{discovered}} by Swedish pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. He had produced oxygen gas by heating <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> and various nitrates in 1771–2. Scheele called the gas [...] "fire air" [...] {{because it was}} the only known supporter of combustion, and wrote an account of this discovery in a manuscript he titled Treatise on Air and Fire, which he sent to his publisher in 1775. That document was published in 1777.|$|E
50|$|Generally, the Koenigs-Knorr {{reaction}} {{refers to}} the use of glycosyl chlorides, bromides and more recently iodides as glycosyl donors. The Koenigs-Knorr reaction can be performed with alternative promoters such as various heavy metal salts including <b>mercuric</b> bromide/mercuric <b>oxide,</b> <b>mercuric</b> cyanide and silver triflate. When mercury salts are used, the reaction is normally called the Helferich method.|$|R
500|$|In March {{he wrote}} to several people {{regarding}} the new [...] "air" [...] that he had discovered in August. One of these letters was read aloud to the Royal Society, and a paper outlining the discovery, titled [...] "An Account of further Discoveries in Air", {{was published in the}} Society's journal Philosophical Transactions. Priestley called the new substance [...] "dephlogisticated air", which he made in the famous experiment by focusing the sun’s rays on a sample of <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide.</b> He first tested it on mice, who surprised him by surviving quite a while entrapped with the air, and then on himself, writing that it was [...] "five or six times better than common air for the purpose of respiration, inflammation, and, I believe, every other use of common atmospherical air". He had discovered oxygen gas (O2).|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, on August 1, 1774, an {{experiment}} {{conducted by the}} British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> (HgO) inside a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named [...] "dephlogisticated air". He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it. After breathing the gas himself, he wrote: [...] "The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly {{different from that of}} common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards." [...] Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled [...] "An Account of Further Discoveries in Air" [...] which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air. Because he published his findings first, Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.|$|E
500|$|The American Chemical Society (ACS) {{has used}} the Joseph Priestley House {{as a place to}} mark special celebrations. On July 31 and August 1, 1874, [...] "seventy-seven chemists made a pilgrimage to the site to {{celebrate}} the centennial of chemistry". The date was chosen to mark the hundredth anniversary of Priestley's experiment producing oxygen by heating <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> with a magnifying lens and sunlight. These chemists came from 15 US states and the District of Columbia, Canada, and England, and their meeting at the house and a local school [...] "is now recognized as the first National Chemistry Congress, and many ACS historians believe it led to ACS's formation two years later on April 6, 1876". On September 5, 1926, about 500 ACS members met again at the home to dedicate the small brick museum and to celebrate the meeting 50 years earlier (two survivors of that first meeting were present).|$|E
500|$|Cavendish, in 1766, was {{the first}} to {{distinguish}} hydrogen from other gases, although Paracelsus around 1500, Robert Boyle (1670), and Joseph Priestley (?) had observed its production by reacting strong acids with metals. Lavoisier named it in 1793. Carl Wilhelm Scheele obtained oxygen by heating <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> and nitrates in 1771, but did not publish his findings until 1777. Priestley also prepared this new [...] "air" [...] by 1774, but only Lavoisier recognized it as a true element; he named it in 1777. Daniel Rutherford discovered nitrogen while he was studying at the University of Edinburgh. He showed that the air in which animals breathed, after removal of exhaled carbon dioxide, was no longer able to burn a candle. Scheele, Henry Cavendish, and Priestley also studied this element at about the same time; Lavoisier named it in 1775-6. Scheele obtained chlorine from hydrochloric acid, but thought it was an oxide. Only in 1808 did Humphry Davy recognize it as an element.|$|E
500|$|Strontium {{is named}} after the Scottish village of Strontian (Gaelic Sròn an t-Sìthein), where it was {{discovered}} in the ores of the lead mines. In 1790, Adair Crawford, a physician engaged {{in the preparation of}} barium, and his colleague William Cruickshank, recognised that the Strontian ores exhibited properties that differed from those in other [...] "heavy spars" [...] sources. This allowed Adair to conclude on page 355 [...] "...it is probable indeed, that the scotch mineral is a new species of earth which has not hitherto been sufficiently examined." [...] The physician and mineral collector Friedrich Gabriel Sulzer analysed together with Johann Friedrich Blumenbach the mineral from Strontian and named it strontianite. He also {{came to the conclusion that}} it was distinct from the witherite and contained a new earth (neue Grunderde). In 1793 Thomas Charles Hope, a professor of chemistry at the University of Glasgow proposed the name [...] strontites. [...] He confirmed the earlier work of Crawford and recounted: [...] "...Considering it a peculiar earth I thought it necessary to give it an name. I have called it Strontites, from the place it was found; a mode of derivation in my opinion, fully as proper as any quality it may possess, which is the present fashion." [...] The element was eventually isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808 by the electrolysis of a mixture containing strontium chloride and <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide,</b> and announced by him in a lecture to the Royal Society on 30 June 1808. In keeping with the naming of the other alkaline earths, he changed the name to strontium.|$|E
2500|$|Bergman next {{suggested}} that Scheele analyze {{the properties of}} manganese dioxide. [...] It was through his studies of manganese dioxide that Scheele developed his concept of [...] "fire air" [...] (his name for oxygen). He ultimately obtained oxygen by heating <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide,</b> silver carbonate, magnesium nitrate, and other nitrate salts. Scheele wrote about his findings to Lavoisier {{who was able to}} see the significance of the results. [...] His discovery of oxygen (ca. 1771) was chronologically earlier than the corresponding work of Priestley and Lavoisier, but he did not publish this discovery until 1777, after both of his rivals had published.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{types of}} battery have been commercialized and {{represent}} an important practical application of electrochemistry. Early wet cells powered the first telegraph and telephone systems, {{and were the}} source of current for electroplating. The zinc-manganese dioxide dry cell was the first portable, non-spillable battery type that made flashlights and other portable devices practical. [...] The mercury battery using zinc and <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> provided higher levels of power and capacity than the original dry cell for early electronic devices, but has been phased out of common use due to the danger of mercury pollution from discarded cells.|$|E
2500|$|Before Scheele {{made his}} {{discovery}} of oxygen, he studied air. [...] Air {{was thought to}} be an element that made up the environment in which chemical reactions took place but did not interfere with the reactions. Scheele's investigation of air enabled him to conclude that air was a mixture of [...] "fire air" [...] and [...] "foul air;" [...] in other words, a mixture of two gases. [...] Scheele performed numerous experiments in which he heated substances such as saltpetre (potassium nitrate), manganese dioxide, heavy metal nitrates, silver carbonate and <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide.</b> In all of these experiments, he isolated the same gas: his [...] "fire air," [...] which he believed combined with phlogiston in materials to be released during heat-releasing reactions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> {{will also}} effect this transformation.|$|E
50|$|In other words, during discharge, zinc is {{oxidized}} (loses electrons) {{to become}} zinc oxide (ZnO) while the <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> gets reduced (gains electrons) to form elemental mercury. A little extra <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> {{is put into}} the cell to prevent evolution of hydrogen gas {{at the end of}} life.|$|E

50|$|A {{mercury battery}} (also called <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> battery, or mercury cell) is a non-rechargeable {{electrochemical}} battery, a primary cell. Mercury batteries use a reaction between <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> and zinc electrodes in an alkaline electrolyte. The voltage during discharge remains practically constant at 1.35 volts, {{and the capacity}} {{is much greater than}} a similarly sized zinc carbon battery. Mercury batteries were used in the shape of button cells for watches, hearing aids, cameras and calculators, and in larger forms for other applications.|$|E
50|$|In practice, this {{analysis}} is largely automated; specific catalysts accelerate the decomposition. Originally, the catalyst of choice was <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide.</b> However, while it was very effective, health concerns resulted in it being replaced by cupric sulfate. Cupric sulfate was not as efficient as <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide,</b> and yielded lower protein results. It was soon supplemented with titanium dioxide, which is currently the approved catalyst {{in all of the}} methods of analysis for protein in the Official Methods and Recommended Practices of AOAC International.|$|E
50|$|Mercury {{batteries}} with cathodes {{made of a}} mix of <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> and {{manganese dioxide}} have output voltage of 1.4 V and a more sloped discharge curve.|$|E

50|$|Dissociation: Conversion of carbonates, sulfides, etc., to oxides {{results in}} no carbon, sulfur, carbonates, or sulfides. Some {{metallic}} oxides (e.g. <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide)</b> even dissociate to their elemental state and/or vaporize completely at wood fire temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Mercury(II) oxide, {{also called}} <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> or simply mercury oxide, has a formula of HgO. It has a red or orange color. Mercury(II) oxide {{is a solid}} at room {{temperature}} and pressure. The mineral form montroydite is very rarely found.|$|E
5000|$|In 1774, Joseph Priestley {{discovered}} that oxygen {{was released by}} heating <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide,</b> {{although he did not}} identify the gas as oxygen (rather, Priestley called it [...] "dephlogisticated air," [...] as that was the paradigm that he was working under at the time).|$|E
50|$|Inorganic mercury {{compounds}} or mercury salts, more {{commonly found in}} nature, include mercuric sulphide (HgS), <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> (HgO) and mercuric chloride (HgCl2). Most of these are white powders or crystals, except for mercuric sulphide which is red and turns black after exposure to light.|$|E
50|$|Magnesium {{was first}} {{produced}} by Sir Humphry Davy in England in 1808 using electrolysis of {{a mixture of}} magnesia and <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide.</b> Antoine Bussy prepared it in coherent form in 1831. Davy’s first suggestion for a name was magnium, but the name magnesium is now used.|$|E
50|$|Some oxides, {{especially}} of weakly electropositive metals decompose when heated to high enough temperatures. A classical {{example is the}} decomposition of <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> to give oxygen and mercury metal. The reaction was used by Joseph Priestley to prepare samples of gaseous oxygen for the first time.|$|E
50|$|The {{metal itself}} was first {{isolated}} by Sir Humphry Davy in England in 1808.

Davy's first suggestion for a name was magnium, but the name magnesium is now used.|$|E
5000|$|Under {{atmospheric}} pressure <b>mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> has two crystalline forms: {{one is called}} montroydite (orthorhombic, 2/m 2/m 2/m, Pnma), {{and the second is}} analogous to the sulfide mineral cinnabar (hexagonal,hP6, P3221); both are characterized by Hg-O chains. [...] At pressures above 10 GPa both structures convert to a tetragonal form.|$|E
5000|$|Mercury {{batteries}} {{use either}} pure mercury(II) oxide (HgO)—also called mercuric oxide—or {{a mixture of}} HgO with manganese dioxide (MnO2) as the cathode. <b>Mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> is a non-conductor, so some graphite is mixed with it; the graphite also helps prevent collection of mercury into large droplets.

50|$|Button {{cells are}} single cells, usually {{disposable}} primary cells. Common anode materials are zinc or lithium. Common cathode materials are manganese dioxide, silver oxide, carbon monofluoride, cupric oxide or oxygen from the air. <b>Mercuric</b> <b>oxide</b> button cells were formerly common, but {{are no longer}} available due to the toxicity and environmental effects of mercury.|$|E
5000|$|Burning lenses {{were used}} both by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier in their {{experiments}} to obtain oxides contained in closed vessels under high temperatures.
