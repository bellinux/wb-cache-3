60|$|After this dry disquisition we will return, dear L., to <b>my</b> <b>doings</b> at Berberah.|$|E
60|$|She made me {{tell her}} all <b>my</b> <b>doings,</b> and she marvelled, {{but all the}} time her eyes were dubious and pitiful.|$|E
6000|$|... "I 've been so busy; and I {{knew you}} would n't care to hear about <b>my</b> <b>doings,</b> for {{they are n't the}} sort you like," [...] {{answered}} Polly.|$|E
60|$|I {{had indeed}} won the sincere regard of my employer. Her father, her cousin George, and new-made friends in town {{had come to}} her with tales of <b>my</b> {{reckless}} <b>doings,</b> and had urged my dismissal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well said, my old comrade!" [...] exclaimed Bladud; [...] "and so {{we shall}} be pleased if you will land us here. But your speech leads me to {{understand}} that you have had news of <b>my</b> father's <b>doings</b> lately. Is the old man well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is to wear {{myself out}} to please her! and I won't go. O, if I {{could live in}} a gay town as a lady should, and go my own ways, and do <b>my</b> own <b>doings,</b> I'd give the {{wrinkled}} half of my life! Yes, reddleman, that would I." ...|$|R
6000|$|For as <b>my</b> <b>doings,</b> {{though my}} {{children}} are fed and clothed thereby, are still <b>my</b> <b>doings,</b> not theirs; so the righteousness wherewith we stand just before God from the curse, still resides in Christ, not in us. Our sins, when laid upon Christ, were yet personally ours, not his; so his righteousness, when put upon us, is yet personally his, not ours. What is it, then? Why, 'he was made to be sin for us, who knew no sin; {{that we might be}} made the righteousness of God in him' (2 Cor 5:21).[3] ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Your aunt {{has always}} been {{inclined}} to disapprove of <b>my</b> <b>doings,</b> and I don’t suppose she’d be interested in my prospecting experiences. We’ll let them stand over till another day.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I’m afraid there often is,” Osborne responded good-humoredly. “Still, while I can’t {{hope for}} your {{approval}} of all <b>my</b> <b>doings,</b> I don’t {{think you have}} much reason to question my veracity.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is very true," [...] said Elizabeth; [...] "though {{it had not}} {{occurred}} to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be <b>my</b> uncle's <b>doings!</b> Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this." ...|$|R
60|$|And now, {{that you}} may {{understand}} to the full the thing that happened, {{it is necessary that}} I should relate it here in its proper sequence, although that must entail my own withdrawal for a time from pages upon which too long I have intruded <b>my</b> own <b>doings</b> and thoughts and feelings.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I may be busy, I may be {{harassed by}} tricksters and bunglers, but I am not too busy {{not to care}} {{something}} about <b>my</b> daughter's <b>doings.</b> I expect them to deceive me, Victoria, but I pinned my faith somewhere. I pinned it on you. On you, do you understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, I {{told you}} <b>my</b> <b>doings</b> would not {{interest}} you, and they don't; they sound flat and prosy after your brilliant adventures. Let 's change the subject," [...] said Polly, looking relieved herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is Colonel Burns's {{report of}} the {{military}} operations of the siege, sir; {{and this is a}} letter from the Resident; and this is my own report, of <b>my</b> <b>doings</b> since I left you at Agra." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May Heaven reward you, sir, {{for that}} kindly thought of me," [...] said Diogenes more seriously, [...] "it will cheer {{me in the}} future, when I and all <b>my</b> <b>doings</b> will have faded from your ken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is no one}} in the East," [...] she said, [...] "because {{those who}} write me weekly send news of <b>my</b> lord's <b>doings.</b> There is {{no one in the}} East, because there they give the body who know nothing of the soul. And so my Prince is safe amongst them. But here--these western women have other gifts. Is that she, master of my life and soul?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, now, Sir Richard, do {{you wonder}} that my lady is sad and downcast with such tales as are going of <b>my</b> lord's <b>doings</b> at court, {{and of what}} there is 'twixt the Queen and him? Her ladyship may be too proud to complain, but she suffers the more for that, poor lamb. There was talk of a divorce awhile ago that got to her ears." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very much}} obliged to you," [...] said Emma, {{laughing}} again. [...] "If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, {{it would have}} been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to equal <b>my</b> own <b>doings</b> at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had no idea}} of {{assuming}} the command, sir; but my tongue always runs fast, and I dare say I did shout, almost unconsciously. I think the sergeant has made more of <b>my</b> <b>doings</b> than I deserved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I thought <b>my</b> <b>doings</b> {{had ceased}} to {{interest}} you,' she said. 'I am Mr Blaythwayt's secretary, I have been here a fortnight. I have wondered if we should meet. I used to see you sometimes in the street.' ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{the king}} came and saw this inscription, {{he stopped to}} read it, and said, [...] "Yes, that is very true; and the reason is, <b>my</b> <b>doings</b> are those of my ministers, while my sayings are my own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Living by myself, I became (as I {{have already}} acknowledged) {{important}} to myself--and, {{as a necessary}} consequence, I enjoyed registering <b>my</b> own daily <b>doings.</b> Let passages copied from my journal reveal how I got through the day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I didn't swear. I do swear. It {{began as}} a joke.... It {{developed}} {{into a sort of}} secret and private bad manners. It's got to be at last like tobacco-ash over all <b>my</b> sayings and <b>doings....</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “He {{sat down}} on his pack and lighted a cigar; {{but he was always}} cool in time of strain. All I {{remember}} of <b>my</b> own <b>doings</b> was that some time afterward I fired a stick of dynamite {{at the bottom of the}} hole and dug out the bits and half-thawn dirt until it was dark. I knew it was wasted labor, because whoever had found the pocket wouldn’t have stopped until he had cleaned it up. Then I threw down my tools and lay among the stones, limp and shivering, while Clay began to talk.” ...|$|R
60|$|Thus it {{was then}} that fate wove me and <b>my</b> <b>doings</b> into the web of some very strange events; terrible, tragic and {{complete}} indeed as those of a Greek play, as it has often done both before and since those days.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Though {{you have}} said it," [...] I said, [...] "I {{will give you a}} second chance." [...] I did not like being called to account for <b>my</b> <b>doings</b> on my own Hill. I wouldn't have stood it even that far except I loved the Boy.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis a {{singularly}} sudden {{interest in}} <b>my</b> <b>doings,</b> this," [...] said he quietly. [...] "What is't you seek of me?" [...] He {{reached for the}} hat he had cast upon the table when they had entered. [...] "Tell me briefly. I may stay no longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then she dried {{her face}} with her long hair, and was about to go away, when her eye {{suddenly}} fell upon the spot where the young man was sitting, and she turned towards the tree. The youth rose and stood waiting. Then the maiden said, 'You ought to have a heavy punishment because you have presumed to watch <b>my</b> secret <b>doings</b> in the moonlight. But I will forgive you this time, because you are a stranger and knew no better. But you must tell me truly who you are and how you came to this place, where no mortal has ever set foot before.' ...|$|R
60|$|And let nobody {{conclude}} {{from the}} strange success I met with in all <b>my</b> wicked <b>doings,</b> {{and the vast}} estate which I had raised by it, that therefore I either was happy or easy. No, no, there was a dart struck into the liver; there was a secret hell within, even all the while, when our joy was at the highest; but more especially now, after it was all over, and when, according to all appearance, I {{was one of the}} happiest women upon earth; all this while, I say, I had such constant terror upon my mind, as gave me every now and then very terrible shocks, and which made me expect something very frightful upon every accident of life.|$|R
40|$|To my family, {{that they}} may learn <b>my</b> secret <b>doings</b> {{during the past few}} months During the first half of 2004, the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) {{underwent}} a major internal transition, as the development branch responsible for the Static Single Assignment (ssa) form — a clever scheme for intermediate code representation — was incorporated into gcc’s main branch. Many compiler optimisations that existed pre-ssa benefit greatly from translation to ssa form; such is the case of Global Value Numbering (gvn), which is an algorithm for finding and removing redundancies in the form of expressions calculated more than once. This paper presents the gvn optimisation and how the author implemented it on ssa form for use in gcc, accompanied by gvn performance measurements derived from the SPEC CPU 2000 benchmark suite. Performance was boosted by up to 6. 1 %: these results motivate the inclusion of gvn on ssa form in gcc. ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have looked}} into my commission,' said Mr. Gilfillan,' subscribed by a worthy and professing nobleman, William, Earl of Glencairn; nor do I find it therein set down that I am to receive any charges or {{commands}} anent <b>my</b> <b>doings</b> from Major William Melville of Cairnvreckan.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I never {{breathed a}} word of <b>my</b> <b>doings</b> to any soul among my friends; once a pack of them met me in the strange neighborhood, when, I am ashamed to say, I muttered {{something}} about a [...] "little French milliner," [...] and walked off, looking as knowing as I could.|$|E
6000|$|It wears me out {{to think}} of it, [...] To think of it; I cannot bear my fate as writ, [...] I'd have my life unbe; Would turn my memory to a blot, Make every relic of me rot, <b>My</b> <b>doings</b> be as they were not, [...] And what they've brought to me! ...|$|E
6000|$|The advice, however, {{made in this}} chapter, {{to employ}} {{commendation}} and encouragement to a great extent, rather than criticism and fault-finding, in the management and instruction of children, must, like all other general counsels of the kind, be held subject to all proper limitations and restrictions. Some mother may, perhaps, object to what is here advanced, saying, [...] "If I am always indiscriminately praising <b>my</b> child's <b>doings,</b> he will become self-conceited and vain, and he will cease to make progress, being satisfied with what he has already attained." [...] Of course he will, and therefore you must {{take care not to}} be always and indiscriminately praising him. You must exercise tact and good judgment, or at any rate, common sense, in properly proportioning your criticism and your praise. There are no principles of management, however sound, which may not be so exaggerated, or followed with so blind a disregard of attendant circumstances, as to produce more harm than good.|$|R
5000|$|Many Israeli actors, directors, and {{producers}} have praised Itzik Kol and cited both {{his work and}} persona as being influential in their own careers:Avi Nesher, a producer and one of Israel’s leading directors (Halehaka, Dizengof 99, Shovrim, Sof Haolam Smola) said about Itzik Kol: [...] "I remember him as having a sharp sense of humor; he was a funny man with a great love of film and of culture. I owe Itzik a lot for my career. Without his confidence in me as a young producer in the movie Halehaka, none of <b>my</b> later <b>doings</b> would not have happened. I was a young, frightened 24-year-old director, {{and he was the}} executive director of Herzliya Studios, who produced many of Uri Zohar's films and TV shows. Today, being a producer myself, I can say that his decision to work with a young director such as myself was very courageous. Undoubtedly {{he is the one who}} made the film possible. His contribution in this respect was huge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing at all. His uncle's people, {{who have}} come home from Muscovy, know nothing of him, and it is thought he may have gone off to the plantations. The talk is that Mistress Martha is to be handed on to the third brother, but {{that she is not}} willing." [...] It was clear that there could have been no spectres here, and Lucy went on, [...] "But you have told me nothing yet of {{yourself}} and your <b>doings,</b> <b>my</b> Anne. How well you look, and more than ever the Court lady, even in your old travelling habit. Is that the watch the King gave you?" ...|$|R
