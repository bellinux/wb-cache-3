It has also been suggested that mechanisms exist which detect contrast <b>modulations</b> across all orientations. Many naturally occurring texture variations (e. g., <b>modulations</b> in orientation and/or spatial frequency) involve simultaneous contrast <b>modulations</b> in multiple channels.

In a series of two experiments it is shown that simultaneous contrast <b>modulations</b> in two narrow orientation bands are detected by three mechanisms, two of which detect contrast <b>modulations</b> within the modulated bands only, the third of which integrates contrast across orientations in order to detect <b>modulations</b> of overall contrast.

40|$|Background. During {{planning}} {{and execution of}} reaching movements, the activity of cortical motor neurons is modulated by a diversity of motor, sensory, and cognitive signals. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) extract part of these <b>modulations</b> to directly control artificial actuators. However, cortical <b>modulations</b> that emerge in the novel context of operating the BMI are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings. Here we analyzed the changes in neuronal <b>modulations</b> that occurred in different cortical motor areas as monkeys learned to use a BMI to control reaching movements. Using spike-train analysis methods we demonstrate that the <b>modulations</b> of the firing-rates of cortical neurons increased abruptly after the monkeys started operating the BMI. Regression analysis revealed that these enhanced <b>modulations</b> {{were not correlated with}} the kinematics of the movement. The initial enhancement in firing rate <b>modulations</b> declined gradually with subsequent training in parallel with the improvement in behavioral performance. Conclusions/Significance. We conclude that the enhanced <b>modulations</b> are related to computational tasks that are significant especially in novel motor contexts.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} with brain-machine-interfaces (BMIs) {{indicate that the}} extent of neural <b>modulations</b> increases abruptly upon starting to operate the interface. In contrast, neural <b>modulations</b> that are correlated with {{the profile of the}} trajectory remain relatively unchanged. Furthermore, the enhanced <b>modulations</b> subside with further training, mirroring the trend in task performance, which degraded when starting to operate the interface and improved gradually with training [1]. Noting that the BMI establishes a novel motor environment, the enhanced <b>modulations</b> have been hypothesized to reflect processes associated with sensorimotor learning. Here we investigate the hypothesis that the enhanced <b>modulations</b> reflect internal representation of estimation errors, and the consequent correction or explorative activity. This hypothesis is supported by further BMI experiments involving center-out movements to randomly located targets on a fixed circle. These BMI experiments facilitate the evaluation of neural <b>modulations</b> (across different reaching movements) at a fixed delay after target appearance. The analysis demonstrates that the relative variance of neural <b>modulations</b> is low during the inter-trials, increases during the initial part of the movement – after target onset – and remains flat in the later part of the movement.

For three different distribution functions (Gaussian, Lorentzian, and exponential) we consider here, the transition probability under frequent <b>modulations</b> is suppressed most if the pulse delay is short and the evolution time is larger than a critical value. Furthermore, decoherence freezing (with a transition rate equals to zero) occurs when there are frequent phase <b>modulations,</b> while the transition rate only decreases when there are frequent measurements and a mix of them, as the pulse delay approaches zero.

Contrast response functions were measured for luminance [(L � M) -cone], red–green [(L � M) -cone] and blue– yellow (S-cone) <b>modulations</b> at various temporal frequencies. In primary visual cortex (V 1), temporal responsivities to luminance and red–green <b>modulations</b> are approximately constant up to 10 Hz, but responsivities to blue–yellow <b>modulations</b> decrease significantly.

40|$|In this paper, the, transient, pressure, film {{thickness}} and lubricant {{profile of a}} starved EHL contact, operating under sinusoidally varying loads, is presented. In a theoretical section, the dimensionless, quasi-static, dry contact solution is discussed. Subsequently, the equations for lubricated contacts will be stated, {{as well as the}} Jakobsson-Floberg-Olsson (JFO) relation for time-dependent, two-dimensional contacts. Numerical solutions are presented, which were obtained by a transient version of Elrod's algorithm. Apart from a brief discussion of the steady state results, the paper focuses on the transient solution. It is shown that the induced oscillatory motion of the rolling element, leads to {{film thickness}} <b>modulations,</b> which are similar to the <b>modulations</b> observed for free vibrations reported in [10]. These <b>modulations</b> propagate at the dimensionless speed of unity and their (dimensionless) wavelength will be shown to equal 2 π/Ωe, where Ωe is the dimensionless excitation frequency. Furthermore, it is shown that lubricant layer <b>modulations</b> are induced in the wake. Initially, these <b>modulations,</b> deposited {{as a result of the}} squeeze motion, are concentric with the Hertzian contact region and, like the film thickness <b>modulations,</b> propagate at the dimensionless speed of unity.

Sequential <b>modulations</b> of poorer strategy effects refer to decreased poorer strategy effects (i. e., poorer performance when the cued strategy {{is not the}} best) on current problem following poorer strategy problems compared to after better strategy problems. Analyses on electrophysiological (EEG) data revealed important age-related changes in time, frequency, and coherence of brain activities underlying sequential <b>modulations</b> of poorer strategy effects. More specifically, sequential <b>modulations</b> of poorer strategy effects were associated with earlier and later time windows (i. e., between 200 - and 550 ms and between 850 - and 1250 ms). Event-related potentials (ERPs) also revealed an earlier onset in older adults, together with more anterior and less lateralized activations. Furthermore, sequential <b>modulations</b> of poorer strategy effects were associated with theta and alpha frequencies in young adults while these <b>modulations</b> were found in delta frequency and theta inter-hemispheric coherence in older adults, consistent with qualitatively distinct patterns of brain activity. These findings have important implications to further our understanding of age-related differences and similarities in sequential <b>modulations</b> of cognitive control processes during arithmetic strategy execution.
