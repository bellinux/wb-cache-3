5|$|Edward had {{a normal}} {{upbringing}} for {{a member of}} a royal family. The prince was interested in horses and horsebreeding, and became a good rider; he also liked dogs, in particular greyhounds. In his letters, he shows a quirky sense of humour, joking about sending unsatisfactory animals to his friends, such as horses who disliked carrying their riders, or lazy hunting dogs too slow to catch rabbits. He was not particularly interested in hunting or falconry, both popular activities in the 14th century. He enjoyed music, including Welsh music and the newly invented crwth instrument, as well as <b>musical</b> <b>organs.</b> He did not take part in jousting, either because he lacked the aptitude or because he had been banned from participating for his personal safety, but he was certainly supportive of the sport.|$|E

60|$|It is {{only when}} we come to the winged insects that we find any large amount of {{peculiarity}} in sexual coloration, and even here it is only developed in certain orders. Flies (Diptera), field-bugs (Hemiptera), cicadas (Homoptera), and the grasshoppers, locusts, and crickets (Orthoptera) present very few and unimportant sexual differences of colour; but the last two groups have special <b>musical</b> <b>organs</b> very fully developed in the males of some of the species, and these no doubt enable the sexes to discover and recognise each other. In some cases, however, when the female is protectively coloured, as in the well-known leaf-insects already referred to (p. 207), the male is smaller and much less protectively formed and coloured. In the bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) it is also the rule that the sexes are alike in colour, though there are several cases among solitary bees where they differ; the female being black, and the male brown in Anthophora retusa, while in Andraena fulva the female is more brightly coloured than the male. Of the great order of beetles (Coleoptera) the same thing may be said. Though often so rich and varied in their colours the sexes are usually alike, and Mr. Darwin was only able to find about a dozen cases in which there was any conspicuous difference between them.[119] They exhibit, however, numerous sexual characters, in the length of the antennae, and in horns, legs, or jaws remarkably enlarged or curiously modified in the male sex.|$|E
50|$|In 1904 {{he married}} Hélène Glaçon {{and they had}} a son Michel and a {{daughter}} Annette. Michael was an engineer and worked on the Paris Métro. Annette was one of his favourite models. Michael was also an expert on <b>musical</b> <b>organs.</b>|$|E
50|$|The New York City Organ Project has {{documented}} the <b>musical</b> <b>organs</b> used or formerly {{used by the}} St. Sebastian Catholic Church, namely the III/Rodgers Instruments electronic organ, the II/Midmer-Losh Organ Company organ in 1930, and the I/6 Geo.

50|$|The facade has {{a wooden}} statue of St Francis. The main altar (1755) has a canvas {{depicting}} Christ and the Virgin granting indulgences to St Francis (1773) by Francesco De Mura. The sacristy has a canvas depicting Conversation with the Crucifix by St Thomas (1580) by Marcus Laurus, held in lunette frescoed with the Virgin with St John the Baptist and St Michael Archangel. The <b>musical</b> <b>organ</b> dates to 1721.|$|R
60|$|Caius Gracchus, it is said, when he harangued the Roman populace, {{modulated}} {{his tone}} by an oratorical flute or pitch pipe. Wilhelmus Kieft, not having such {{an instrument at}} hand, availed himself of that <b>musical</b> <b>organ</b> or trump which nature has implanted {{in the midst of}} a man's face; in other words, he preluded his address by a sonorous blast of the nose; a preliminary flourish much in vogue among public orators.|$|R
50|$|Bugs is {{established}} as an anti-aesthete first by his initial choice of <b>musical</b> <b>organ,</b> the banjo. Secondly, he performs in a backwoods setting, {{as opposed to}} Giovanni's modern house. Thirdly, he sings from memory while Giovanni uses sheet music. He is also implied to be an untrained musician, contrasting with the trained Giovanni. A further contrast is implied through the geographic origin of their songs. Bugs sings American popular songs, while Giovanni' repertoire is Western European in origin.|$|R
50|$|In 1931 {{the church}} was {{declared}} a historic and artistic landmark by the Spanish government, but during the Spanish Civil War it was burned, which meant that it lost part of its decorative elements. The choir, located in the central part, was dismantled in 1940 {{and moved to the}} bottom of the high altar. The <b>musical</b> <b>organs,</b> which had suffered major damage during the war, were never rebuilt.|$|E
5000|$|This {{church was}} {{commissioned}} by the Oratorians. The architect of the domed centralized church was Venetian architect Giorgio Massari. Construction began in 1720 and ended in 1746. The unfinished facade stands in contrast with an opulent interior that includes pink marble Corinthian columns and statues of the apostles by artist Antonio Calegari of Brescia. The nave of the church has two fresco-style paintings painted by Francesco Monti and Giovanni Zanardi. The main altar is flanked by ornate <b>musical</b> <b>organs.</b>|$|E

25|$|Because {{the human}} voice {{is seen as}} the most perfect {{instrument}} of praise, <b>musical</b> instruments (<b>organs,</b> guitars, etc.) are not generally used to accompany the choir.|$|R
50|$|The Oratory was {{designed}} in 1696 by Francesco Galli Bibiena, {{as part of}} the complex of the Church of the Suffragio. It interior is rectangular with a semicircular apse. The interior stucco decoration was made in 1698 by Giovanni Mercoli (1698). The lateral altars have depicting a Massacre of the Infants (1698) and Madonna and Saints by Giovanni Bolla. The <b>musical</b> <b>organ</b> by G. Diotti dates to 1701. The wooden main altar was sculpted by Giulio Seletti. The façade with its peculiar second-story colonnade has a terracotta statue (1806) by Giuseppe Carra.|$|R
50|$|In Sophistical Refutations, Aristotle {{mentions}} Lycophron as {{an example}} of changing the subject of a conversation when one has nothing to state on the original subject. He reports that once Lycophron was compelled by certain persons to speak in praise of the lyre. He reportedly found himself {{at a loss for words}} on this subject. So he offered a few words on the <b>musical</b> <b>organ</b> and then switched the topic to Lyra, the constellation named after it. Being more knowledgeable in this topic, he had much more to say.|$|R
50|$|His father, {{who built}} <b>musical</b> <b>organs,</b> {{wanted him to}} follow in the profession, but the boy {{inclined}} towards art, and he received early mentorship from the sculptor Luigi Mainoni, professor of the Academy of Modena. At the Modenese Academy he won all the contests, and garnered a stipend to study in Florence, and where he was helped by the sculptor Giovanni Duprè and Pietro Cantini. His first essay in sculpture, submitted back to Modena, was a stucco of Drunkenness, that is, a life-size, disheveled Bacchante drinking. Then he sent a group of two figures, shepherds and sheepdog. Sighinolfi won the first prize in a contest sponsored by Baron Ricasoli for the design of equestrian statues of Napoleon III and Victor Emmanuel. He also won a competition for a monument to Cardinal Niccolò Fortiguerra to be erected in Pistoia. He then sculpted a statue of an Apollonian young man entitled The Genius of the Revolution.|$|E
50|$|The {{church was}} {{initiated}} during 1468 to 1493, and completed between 1494 and 1515. The church has temple-fortress layout {{with a single}} nave. It has a bell-tower with a square base and octagonal top. The sides has buttresses. The main portal has an Isabelline Gothic decoration with arched top. It had some refurbishments over the years, but the interior had to wait till the 17th century for completion. The main retablo was added then. The <b>musical</b> <b>organ</b> was built by García Herráiz, but the pipes disappeared during the Spanish civil war, and only rebuilt in 2006-2009.|$|R
50|$|Tipu {{distributed}} {{copies of}} his military manual to all of his officers. In the manual he defined 200 men to handle rockets {{within each of the}} Mysore cushoons, with 16 to 24 cushoons of infantry. The personnel handling the rockets were trained to define the launch angle to properly affect the curve at which the rocket would land. Tipu also defined in the manual a multiple rocket launcher (much like a <b>musical</b> <b>organ)</b> that would launch up to 10 rockets. Some of the rockets had blades {{in the front of the}} bamboo guiding rods, while others were designed as incendiary rockets.|$|R
50|$|He was {{responsible}} for the destruction of the <b>musical</b> clock <b>organ</b> that Elizabeth I of England sent to the court during the reign of his father. The reason for this may have been Ahmed's religious objection to figurative art.|$|R

According to Douy they were based on the script and were not reproductions of the interior of Chateau de la Ferté-Saint-Aubin, where exterior scenes were shot. The music boxes used in the film were borrowed from several sources and some are now in a museum in Neuilly-sur-Seine. Renoir thought the <b>musical</b> <b>organ</b> scene and Dalio's performance in it was the best scene he had ever filmed. He shot the scene several times before he was satisfied with it.

50|$|A {{residence}} organ (also known variously as a house, box, cabinet, choir, continuo, home, practice, trunk, or chamber <b>organ)</b> is a <b>musical</b> <b>organ</b> {{installed in}} a personal home. Strictly speaking, the names residence and house organ are the most correct, the others being types of organs that can physically be used as residence organs, but that are not restricted to use solely in that context, and {{can also be used}} in, say, small churches, theatres, and so forth. A portative organ or a positive organ (which are also, but imprecisely, known as box, trunk, and cabinet organs) {{can be used in a}} residential setting, but the notion of a residence organ strictly embodies a permanence of place that is belied by the notion of portability embodied by the portatives and positives. Similarly, a chamber organ (also known imprecisely as a cabinet, desk, or bureau organ) is in general a small organ for a room, but not necessarily for a room of someone's home.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} adapted into a <b>musical</b> <b>Organ</b> in My Memory (also known as Organ in My Heart) in 2008, {{which focused on}} {{reviving}} the romantic atmosphere and literary sensitivity of the 1960s on stage as the film did. [...] "The original novel was published in 1980s and the film was made in 1990s and now the musical rendition will be made in 2000s, showing the tireless energy of the work because of its pure and touching story," [...] a public relations official of the production company Show Tic Communications, said. The musical featured visually catching pink-toned stage sets to exude a romantic atmosphere, along with modern music and choreography played by 21 actors {{to curry favor with}} the modern audience. The initial run at Hoam Arts Hall (July 22 to September 11, 2008) also drew attention from the public for the return of musical theater-turned-TV/film actor Oh Man-seok to the stage.|$|R
5000|$|Modern rocket {{artillery}} {{was first}} employed during World War II, {{in the form}} of the German Nebelwerfer family of rocket ordnance designs, and Soviet Katyusha-series. The Soviet Katyushas, nicknamed by German troops Stalin's Organ because of their visual resemblance to a church <b>musical</b> <b>organ</b> and alluding to the sound of the weapon's rockets, were mounted on trucks or light tanks, while the early German Nebelwerfer ordnance pieces were mounted on a small wheeled carriage which was light enough to be moved by several men and could easily be deployed nearly anywhere, while also being towed by most vehicles. The Germans also had self-propelled rocket artillery {{in the form of}} the Panzerwerfer and Wurfrahmen 40 which equipped half-track armoured fighting vehicles. An oddity in the subject of rocket artillery during this time was the German [...] "Sturmtiger", a vehicle based on the Tiger I heavy tank chassis that was armed with a 380 mm rocket mortar.|$|R

5000|$|The English word [...] "organ" [...] {{derives from}} the Latin , meaning [...] "instrument", itself from the Greek word , [...] ("implement; <b>musical</b> instrument; <b>organ</b> of the body").
