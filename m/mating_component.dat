50|$|Spin welding is a {{particular}} form of frictional welding. With this process, one component with a round weld joint is held stationary, while a <b>mating</b> <b>component</b> is rotated at high speed and pressed against the stationary component. The rotational friction between the two components generates heat. Once the joining surfaces reach a semi-molten state, the spinning component is stopped abruptly. Force on the two components is maintained until the weld joint cools and re-solidifies. This is a common way of producing low- and medium-duty plastic wheels, e.g., for toys, shopping carts, recycling bins, etc. This process {{is also used to}} weld various port openings into automotive under hood components.|$|E

The file server's kernel was also extended with a <b>mating</b> <b>component</b> that received the remote requests {{and handed them to}} a pool of kernel processes for service, though a standard handler could have been written to do this. (Later in its product lifecycle, ISC deployed standard SVR4-based Unix servers in place of the DNIX servers. These used X.25 STREAMS and a custom-written file server program. In spite of the less efficient structuring, the raw horsepower of the platforms used made for a much faster server. It is unfortunate that this file server program did not support all of the functionality of the native DNIX server. Tricky things, like named pipes, never worked at all. This was another justification for the named pipe handler process.) ...|$|E

50|$|Tolerance Rings are {{radially}} sprung rings {{that are}} press fitted between two <b>mating</b> <b>components</b> {{to act as}} frictional fasteners. They are flexible shims designed to fix two cylindrical parts together. The wavelike protrusions that run around the circumference of the ring generate a retention force to provide an optimal fit between the two <b>mating</b> <b>components</b> {{without the need for}} adhesive or excessive assembly force, simplifying the process for manufacturers. They allow for any misalignment caused by thermal expansion or excessive vibration. Tolerance rings can be used as bearing mounts and as a means of dealing with torque transfer, torque overload protection and axial slip between <b>mating</b> <b>components.</b> They are often used to isolate undesirable vibration in engines and electric motors, for noise-free mechanism operation in passenger vehicles and domestic appliances, where noise reduction has become a major trend in recent years. Modifications to tolerance rings can be made to tune the dynamic stiffness and, therefore, the frequencies that can be isolated.|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{inherent}} tolerance variability of hardware, flange misalignments occur during installation of <b>mating</b> <b>components</b> for a liquid propellant rocket engine. Flange misalignments include axial, lateral, and angular offsets. If these misalignments are high, they can impart significant loads into the two <b>mating</b> <b>components.</b> These significant loads {{can then be}} a driver {{in the design of}} the propellant ducts. Such was the case for the Rocketdyne RS- 83 engine design for the Space Launch Initiative Program. To address this flange misalignment issue, Marshall Space Flight Center joined with Rocketdyne to develop and test a spherical flange system that allows for misalignment, yet reduces loads imparted, and at the same time provides sufficient sealing against leakage. The flange design was tested to evaluate and compare performance parameters such as misalignment and leakage. The environmental conditions ranged from - 100 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (F) with 1000 to 4000 pounds per square inch gage (psig) pressure.

50|$|Pipe dope is any thread lubricant, {{thread sealing}} compound, and {{anaerobic}} chemical sealants {{that are used}} to make a pipe thread joint leak proof and pressure tight. Although common pipe threads are tapered and therefore will achieve an interference fit during proper assembly, machining and finishing variances usually result in a fit that does not result in 100 percent contact between the <b>mating</b> <b>components.</b> The application of pipe dope prior to assembly will fill the minute voids between the threads, thus making the joint pressure tight. Pipe dope also acts as a lubricant and helps prevent seizing of the mating parts, which can later cause difficulty during disassembly.|$|R

Numerous trade-offs, design decisions, and innovations were made during the development of the assembly system in order to both reduce and compensate for the sensor noise. By using relative positioning, decoupling sensing and manipulation, caching high-quality position estimates, and developing a new waypoint-completion metric, we were able to reduce sensor noise to the sub-millimeter level and autonomously assemble components with millimeter tolerances.

Several molecules and effects that induce {{these changes have}} been identified, but their proximate effects on females remain unexplored. We examined whether vesicle release occurs {{as a consequence of}} mating; we used transgenic Drosophila that allow monitoring of secretory granule release at nerve termini. Changes in release occur at specific times postmating in different regions of the female reproductive tract: soon after mating in the lower reproductive tract, and later in the upper reproductive tract. Some changes are triggered by receipt of sperm, others by male seminal proteins, and still others by the act of mating itself (or other unidentified effectors). Our findings indicate that the female reproductive tract is a multi-organ system whose regions are modulated separately by <b>mating</b> and <b>mating</b> <b>components.</b> This modulation could create an environment conducive to increased reproductive capacity...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{precision}} assemblies in {{high volume}} manufacturing have used pin-hole joints; however {{the evolution of}} more stringent design requirements has pushed the performance of this method to its practical performance limit of approximately five microns repeatability. Next generation designs (i. e. automotive engines and pump assemblies) require low-cost couplings which permit sealing between interfaces and deliver better than five micron repeatability. This presentation will introduce a fundamentally new type of kinematic coupling, the quasi-kinematic coupling, which costs less than most precision pinned joints, delivers sub-micron repeatability, and allows contact/sealing between <b>mated</b> <b>components.</b> GEOMETRY In general, Quasi-Kinematic Couplings (QKCs) are well-suited for high volume precision assembly, particularly where integral locating features and/or sealing contact are required. Quasi-kinematic couplings are similar to traditional Kinematic Couplings as they consist of three convex protrusions which mate with three corresponding grooves. However, QKC grooves and convex surfaces are formed as surfaces of revolutions (i. e. for instance a conical hole). Mating the kinematic elements results in six arced lines of contact (two at each groove-protrusion joint) not six points as in a kinemati...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} imposed displacement and initial coating thickness on fretting wear behaviour of a thermally sprayed coating. Initial coating thickness and imposed displacement between two <b>mating</b> <b>components</b> are important parameters affecting durability of a thermally sprayed coating under fretting conditions. Nevertheless, the effects of imposed displacement and coating thickness at flat-and-rounded frictional contacts of aerospace dovetail connections are not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, fretting wear experiments with a double-layer thermally sprayed coating are performed under different displacement and coating thickness conditions. The effects of the parameters are then identified by directly comparing the ratio of maximum tangential force to normal force. Experimental {{results show that the}} ratio evolutions are similar on the ratio versus accumulated reciprocal sliding distance chart within the displacement range of 0. 4 - 0. 6. mm. In addition, it is demonstrated that durability of the coating is increased with increasing the initial thickness of the coating.

In this work, the benefits deriving {{from the use of}} fiber laser sources for surface texturing of very thin TiN coatings in severe wear working conditions were demonstrated.

Wear performance of the fiber laser textured surfaces was evaluated in discontinuous oil lubricated conditions with a flat contact. High normal load and low sliding speed were applied. Comparison tests were also performed on commercial TiN and WC/C coatings. In terms of average wear volume and maximum wear depth, Laser Surface Texturing of TiN provided respectively a 70 % and a 45 % reduction if compared to plain TiN. If compared to WC/C the wear resistance gains were lower but LST TiN maintained such benefits for longer wear runs.

The device is likewise not limited to circular configurations but can be used for many other shapes or configurations. Any material that can be machined and hold reasonably close tolerances can be used for the device. Also, because the sleeve position is adjusted by set screws or bolts, the concentricity can be radially biased, if required, to achieve particular alignment conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{gaps between}} two mating {{surfaces}} should be strictly controlled in precision manufacturing. Oversizing of gaps will decrease the dimensional accuracy and {{may reduce the}} fatigue life of a mechanical product. In {{order to reduce the}} gaps and keep them within tolerance, the relative posture (orientation and position) of two components should be optimized in the assembly process. This paper presents an optimal posture evaluation model to control the assembly gaps in aircraft wing assembly. Based on the step alignment strategy, i. e. preliminary alignment and refined alignment, the concept of a small posture transformation (SPT) is introduced. In the preliminary alignment, an initial posture is estimated by a set of auxiliary locating points (ALPs), with which the components can be quickly aligned near each other. In the refined alignment, the assembly gaps are calculated and the formulation of the gaps with component posture is derived by the SPT. A comprehensive weighted minimization model with gap tolerance constraints is established for redistributing the gaps in multi-regions. Powell-Hestenes-Rockafellar (PHR) optimization, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and KD-tree searching are introduced for the solution of the optimal posture for localization. Using the SPT, the trigonometric posture transformation is linearized, which benefits the iterative solution process. Through the constrained model, overall gaps are minimized and excess gaps are controlled within tolerance. Practical implications – This method has been tested with simulated model data and real product data, the results of which have shown efficient coordination of <b>mating</b> <b>components.</b> This paper proposed an optimal posture evaluation method for minimizing the gaps between <b>mating</b> surfaces through <b>component</b> adjustments.

40|$|Males {{and females}} often {{experience}} different optima in mating rate, which may cause evolution of female resistance to matings and male counter adaptations to increase mating rate. Males {{of the spider}} Pisaura mirabilis display a spectacular mating behavior involving a nuptial gift and thanatosis (death feigning). Thanatosis in a sexual context is exceptional and was suggested to function as an antipredation strategy toward potentially cannibalistic females. If thanatosis serves as a protection strategy, males should death feign in response to female aggression or when they are more vulnerable to attack. We tested these predictions in a factorial design: males that were handicapped (1 leg removed) and hence vulnerable and control males were paired with females that {{were more or less}} aggressive intrinsically (measured toward prey). In mating trials, we recorded the tendency of males to death feign, copulation success, and copulation duration. In addition, we investigated the effect of female mating status (virgin or mated) on these male <b>mating</b> <b>components.</b> Intrinsically aggressive females showed increased mating aggression toward males. Neither female aggressiveness, mating status, nor male vulnerability increased the propensity of males to perform thanatosis. Instead, death-feigning males were more successful in obtaining copulations and gained longer copulations. Hence, our results suggest that thanatosis functions as an adaptive male mating strategy to overcome female resistance. All males were capable of performing thanatosis although some males use it more frequently than others, suggesting a cost of death feigning which maintains the variation in thanatosis during courtship.

40|$|AbstractCoffee is a {{very common}} {{beverage}} exported all over the world: just after roasting, coffee beans are packed in plastic or paper bags, which then experience long transfers with long storage times. Fresh roasted coffee emits large amounts of CO 2 for several weeks. This gas must be gradually released, to prevent package over-inflation and to preserve aroma, moreover beans must be protected from oxygen coming from outside. Therefore, one-way degassing valves are applied to each package: their correct functionality is strictly related to the interference coupling between their bodies and covers and to the correct assembly of the other involved parts. This work takes inspiration from an industrial problem: a company that assembles valve components, supplied by different manufacturers, observed {{a high level of}} defect rate, affecting its valve production. An integrated approach, consisting in the adoption of quality charts, in an experimental campaign for the dimensional analysis of the mating parts and in the statistical processing of the data, was necessary to tackle the question. In particular, a simple statistical tool was made available to predict the defect rate and to individuate the best strategy for its reduction. The outcome was that requiring a strict protocol, regarding the combinations of parts from different manufacturers for assembly, would have been almost ineffective. Conversely, this study led to the individuation of the weak point in the manufacturing process of the <b>mating</b> <b>components</b> and to the suggestion of a slight improvement to be performed, with the final result of a significant (one order of magnitude) decrease of the defect rate...|$|R
