That same year, Cole-Parmer acquired Masterflex peristaltic pumps, followed shortly by the purchases of Gilmont Instruments and <b>Manostat</b> Pumps.|$|E

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed in 11.5 % (wt/vol) gels according to the method of Laemmli (1970). Proteins and CGP were visualized by Coomassie blue staining (Weber and Osborn 1969). Free amino acids and dipeptides were detected by HPLC (Kontron Instruments, Neufahrn, Germany) after precolumn derivatization with ortho-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) as described before (Aboulmagd et al. 2000; Sallam and Steinbüchel 2008). CGP samples were subjected to acid hydrolysis (6 N HCl, 95 °C, overnight) before amino acid analysis.|$|E
