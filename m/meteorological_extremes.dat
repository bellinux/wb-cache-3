In this study, we focus on the integration of PROBA-V data to continue the SPOT-VGT time series. In the frame of the European infrastructure Lifewatch, our goal is to provide information about ecosystem dynamics to researchers. Phenology is therefore important because it has a strong impact on animal behavior, and it has been linked to changes in geographical distribution of animal species over time. Since PROBA-V has acquired the possibility to get data in the north of Europe during winter, it becomes interesting to analyze the snow classification of PROBA-V for two main reasons. First, data from the northern regions are crucial to monitor anomalies of snow and their effects over populations. Second, PROBA-V has a higher spatial resolution than MODIS even if the latter has a good overall snow classification...|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach to}} projecting <b>meteorological</b> <b>extremes</b> involves {{the application of}} indices such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) to rainfall simulated by General Circulation Models (GCMs). However, the sensitivity of SPI {{to the length of}} the records and the poor skills of GCMs in simulating rainfall are major drawbacks, leading to implausible projections. It is imperative to quantify and address these limitations before implementation of the approach. Here, we project the frequency of extreme dry and wet spells during the 21 (st) century over India, incorporating special measures to alleviate the aforementioned limitations of the approach. We deploy kernel regression-based statistical downscaling to obtain improved 0. 25 -degree resolution monthly rainfall projections for India based on five GCMs and three emission scenarios (RCP 2. 6, RCP 4. 5, and RCP 8. 5) belonging to phase five of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. We also establish that the Standardized non-stationarity Precipitation Index (SnsPI), which incorporates changing climatic conditions considering linearly varying non-stationary scale parameter of the gamma distribution, is less sensitive to the length of the records as compared to SPI and we use both indices to obtain the frequency of future <b>meteorological</b> <b>extremes.</b> The results show an increase in the occurrences of extreme dry spells (EDS) over central, southeast coast, eastern region and some parts of northeast India. Differences between SPI and SnsPI based on the sensitivity are observed over, central India, where SPI overestimates EDS.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades the {{combination}} of an increasing human occupation along the coast combined with an anticipated intensification {{in the frequency of}} <b>meteorological</b> <b>extreme</b> events stimulated the development of different methodological alternatives to assess and predict coastal risk. Conceptually, a global risk analysis may involve susceptibility and vulnerability, in both temporal and spatial scales, with the goal of identifying critical hazard areas. In this work, two different analytical approaches are presented within the perspective of their future integration: spatial analysis based on Geographic Information Systems and numerical modeling. In the first approach, individual information layers associated with various themes (e. g. backshore landforms, backshore altitude, shoreline displacement, shoreline exposure to wave incidence and man-made structures at risk) were integrated and allowed the development of a numerical index of coastal vulnerability. In order to define inundation levels, a wave run-up study integrated numerical modeling and in situ measurements, allowing the recognition of sensible variations along an embayed beach. Finally, an erosional hot spot area was investigated by calculating longshore sediment transport rates.

40|$|Extreme {{weather events}} have played an {{important}} role in driving the ecosystem dynamics in high altitude areas, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To understand if and how the soil processes of an ecosystem react to extreme drought, we manipulated a once-in-a-century <b>meteorological</b> <b>extreme</b> drought in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau, which is also known as the "forerunner of global weather changes". The extremity was determined by statistical extreme weather events with respect to a historical reference period from April to September during 1962 - 2004, where the local historical precipitation data was calculated and intensified to 100 -year recurrent drought event with Gumbel I distribution. The indicators we measured included soil microbial biomass C/N/P and soil enzymatic activities of phosphatase (AP) disbounding organic phosphate, cellobiohydrolase (CBH), beta-glucocidase (BG), N-releasing enzyme N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) as well as soil respirations, during and after the treatments. It was found that the manipulated event induced a rapid shift in microbial biomass and activities, indicating a lower resistance of the underground process. However, the microbial and biochemical parameters saw rapid recovery after the event, which meant the soil processes enjoyed high resilience. The high responsiveness and lag-time effects of the soil indicators rendered new horizons for us to evaluate the interaction between the extremes and the ecosystem stability. Our study indicated that the once-in-a-century extreme drought induced very short term response in the soil biotic process, and the soil processes worked to buffer against such events under the observation period...|$|R

40|$|Day-to-day water {{management}} is challenged by <b>meteorological</b> <b>extremes,</b> causing floods and droughts.

This is called Anticipatory Water Management. Anticipatory actions may have adverse effects, such as when flood control actions turn out to have been unnecessary, because the actual rainfall was less than predicted. Therefore the uncertainty of the forecasts and the associated risks of applying Anticipatory Water Management have to be assessed.

40|$|Temporal {{trends in}} <b>meteorological</b> <b>extremes</b> are often {{examined}} by first reducing daily data to annual index values, such as 95 th or 99 th percentiles.

The initial step is to make separate estimates of tail probabilities of precipitation amounts for each combination of station and year by fitting a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) to data above a user-defined threshold. The resulting time series of annual percentile estimates are subsequently fed into a multivariate Mann-Kendall (MK) test for monotonic trends. We performed extensive simulations using artificially generated precipitation data and noted {{that the power of}} tests for temporal trends was substantially enhanced when ordinary percentiles were substituted for GPD percentiles. Furthermore, we found that the trend detection was robust to misspecification of the extreme value distribution. An advantage of the MK test is that it can accommodate nonlinear trends, and it can also take into account the dependencies between stations in a network. To illustrate our approach, we used long time series of precipitation data from a network of stations in the Netherlands.

Third assessment report of {{the intergovernmental panel on climate}} change (IPCC) pointed out that the extremes referred to the rare events based on a statistical model of particular weather elements, and changes in the extreme events may relate to changes in the mean and variance (IPCC 2001). Furthermore, IPCC fourth assessment report summarized the characteristics of precipitation extremes at the global and regional scales and indicated that the frequency of heavy precipitation events increased over most land areas (IPCC 2007). Recently, IPCC Fifth Assessment Report also indicated that the number of heavy precipitation events over land has increased in more regions since the mid- 20 th century and floods larger than recorded since the 20 th century occurred during the past five centuries in eastern Asia (IPCC 2013). The research on observed precipitation revealed a distinct link between rainfall extremes and temperature, with the increasing in heavy rainfall events during the warm periods and the decreasing during the cold periods (Allan and Soden 2008). Furthermore, much research indicated that extreme precipitation events were very sensitive to global climate change, so a small change in average climate may cause large changes in the statistics of precipitation extreme events (Groisman et al. 1999; Easterling et al. 2000; Meehl et al. 2000; Groisman et al. 2005).|$|R
