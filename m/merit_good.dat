The public discourse is thus rendered more intellectually honest. 	The article progresses in three parts. First, I describe the concept of “merit goods. ” This concept, introduced fifty years ago, has met with resistance from traditional economists because it justifies interference with individuals’ preferences and imposing values, something economics ostensibly rejects. Second, I show that the <b>merit</b> <b>goods</b> concept nonetheless can be used to clarify U. S. Supreme Court cases regarding regulatory takings, indicating that values imposition is not just a theoretical matter.

50|$|The {{concept of}} a <b>merit</b> <b>good</b> {{introduced}} in economics by Richard Musgrave (1957, 1959) is a commodity which is judged that an individual or society should have {{on the basis of}} some concept of need, rather than ability and willingness to pay. The term is, perhaps, less often used today {{than it was in the}} 1960s to 1980s but the concept still lies behind many economic actions by governments which are not performed specifically for financial reasons or by supporting incomes (e.g. via tax rebates). Examples include the provision of food stamps to support nutrition, the delivery of health services to improve quality of life and reduce morbidity, subsidized housing and arguably education.|$|E

50|$|Eschatological ideas {{evolved in}} Hinduism. In {{earliest}} Vedic literature, {{heaven and hell}} sufficed soteriological curiosities. Over time, the ancient scholars observed that people vary {{in the quality of}} virtuous or sinful life they lead, and began questioning how differences in each person’s puṇya (<b>merit,</b> <b>good</b> deeds) or pāp (demerit, sin) as human beings affected their afterlife. This question led to the conception of an afterlife where the person stayed in heaven or hell, in proportion to their merit or demerit, then returned to earth and were reborn, the cycle continuing indefinitely. The rebirth idea ultimately flowered into the ideas of saṃsāra, or transmigration - where one’s balance sheet of karma determined one’s rebirth. Along with this idea of saṃsāra, the ancient scholars developed the concept of moksha, as a state that released a person from the saṃsāra cycle. Moksha release in eschatological sense in these ancient literature of Hinduism, suggests van Buitenen, comes from self-knowledge and consciousness of oneness of supreme soul.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{determine}} features {{of the market for}} higher education services under modern conditions of globalization {{in the context of the}} theory of <b>merit</b> <b>goods.</b> In view of a holistic vision of education as a sphere of economic development, it is proved that the educational service of a higher education institution is a process and result at the same time; there disclosed a complex nature of the educational product of a higher education establishment represented by educational programs and technologies, formalized and implicit knowledge, physical and mental components of organization of the educational and scientific process. Services in the sphere of higher education have both features inherent in the majority of services in general and specific properties, the most important of which is a complementary nature of individual and social usefulness of their production and consumption, which allows to define them as <b>merit</b> <b>goods.</b> The state tutelage over the market for educational services is substantiated by the lag of demand for such services behind long-term interests of society because individual consumers are willing to buy <b>merit</b> <b>goods</b> at a price that is significantly lower than the total expenditure on training specialists. The merit market for national higher education services is characterized by disequilibrium caused by systemic and local institutional traps, the smoothing of which requires not only a competitive state educational policy but also balanced marketing policy of educational institutions that becomes possible under conditions of real autonomy of higher education institutions...|$|R
