5|$|During the <b>mating</b> <b>season</b> rival males may compete by wrestling, not by biting. Opponents {{attempt to}} subdue {{each other by}} intertwining their bodies and raising their heads high off the ground. Observers have on {{occasion}} mistaken such wrestling for mating.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before <b>mating</b> <b>season</b> begins, females exhibit {{swelling}} of the sex skin, which reaches its peak around {{the middle of their}} 14.8 day estrous cycle. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with testicular volume increasing during <b>mating</b> <b>season,</b> peaking around the time of breeding. Aggression also increases during the <b>mating</b> <b>season,</b> both between members of the same sex and by females towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting the male during copulation. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in estrus. Initially they may roar-shriek with each other. When a male approaches a female he often lowers his head and squeals, inspecting the female's genitalia by licking or sniffing, scent-marking, and offering a submissive chattering vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture herself for mounting. Mating pairs often copulate many times {{during the course of a}} mating bout.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mating</b> <b>season</b> lasts from May through July, {{during the}} cold, rainy season, {{resulting}} in birth and peak lactation {{coinciding with the}} time that fruit is the most plentiful. The gestation period of ruffed lemurs is the shortest of the family Lemuridae, averaging 102 days (with a range of 90 to 106 days). Gestation in the wild last slightly longer than in captivity, averaging 106 days. Just like the <b>mating</b> <b>season,</b> parturition is also seasonal, synchronized {{to the end of}} the cold, dry season and the start of the productive hot, rainy season.|$|E

40|$|Hsu (2008) Effects {{of troop}} size on social {{relations}} among male Formosan macaques, Macaca cyclopis. Zoological Studies 47 (3) : xxx-xxx. We investigated {{the effects of}} troop size on differences in grooming and agonistic behaviors among adult males (AMs) and adult females (AFs) of Formosan macaques (Macaca cyclopis) during <b>mating</b> and non-mating <b>seasons.</b> Data were recorded {{for a total of}} 1248. 8 h in 2 free-ranging social groups from Aug. 2000 to Feb. 2003 at Mt. Longevity, Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan. The socionomic sex ratios of these 2 social groups were similar during the <b>mating</b> <b>seasons</b> (AM: AF= 1 : 1. 8). Both troop and peripheral males had significantly higher frequencies of social grooming with AFs in the mating than in non-mating seasons. The types of males and social groups, however, had significant effects on the allogrooming frequency among AMs in the <b>mating</b> <b>seasons</b> but not in the non-mating seasons. Moreover, troop males had higher numbers of grooming partners than did peripheral males. Major grooming partners of troop males were adult females regardless of the seasons. Nonetheless, peripheral AMs had more male grooming partners seemingly to enhance male affiliative relations. Subordinate males were mostly receivers in grooming dyads with dominant males in the <b>mating</b> <b>seasons,</b> but the relationships changed during the non-mating seasons. Agonistic interactions occurred mainly during the <b>mating</b> <b>seasons,</b> and their frequency among peripheral males was 1. 8 times that of troop males (p < 0. 05). Formosan macaque AMs employ complex strategies to balance competition and affiliative relations and ultimately achieve reproductive success...|$|R
5|$|Black mambas are {{generally}} solitary, but not strictly so; {{as a rule}} they interact very little except in male rivalry during the <b>mating</b> <b>season.</b> However, black mambas are well known to share retreats occasionally, either with other mambas, or sometimes with other species of snakes.|$|E
5|$|Finally, it {{is quite}} {{possible}} that the sail or hump combined these functions, acting normally as a heat regulator, becoming a courting aid during the <b>mating</b> <b>season,</b> being used to cool itself and, on occasions, turning into an intimidating device when an animal was feeling threatened.|$|E
5|$|Fishers are {{generally}} crepuscular, being most active {{at dawn and}} dusk. They are active year-round. Fishers are solitary, associating with other fishers only for mating purposes. Males become more active during <b>mating</b> <b>season.</b> Females are least active during pregnancy and gradually increase activity after birth of their kits.|$|E
50|$|According to Chinese tradition, mogwai {{are certain}} demons, which often inflict harm on humans. They {{are said to}} {{reproduce}} sexually during <b>mating</b> <b>seasons</b> triggered by the coming of rain. Supposedly, they take care to breed at these times because rain signifies rich and full times ahead.|$|R
40|$|This study compares {{adult and}} {{adolescent}} female rhesus macaques {{with regard to}} (1) characteristics of their copulatory partners, (2) their proceptive behaviors, and (3) adult male behaviors toward them during estrus. We conducted focal follows of 24 adolescent and 65 adult free-ranging estrous female rhesus macaques on Cayo Santiago during two <b>mating</b> <b>seasons.</b> Compared to adult females, adolescents presented sexually to males at higher rates; copulated more frequently with rankless young male, and extra-group males; and, {{in one of two}} <b>mating</b> <b>seasons,</b> were ignored more frequently by males to whom they presented sexually. Adolescents tended to copulate with ranked, resident males at higher frequencies on days when the operational sex ratio (adult males:estrous adult females) was high. Males directed “muzzle-up” signals to adolescents at lower rates than to adults in one of two <b>mating</b> <b>seasons,</b> although this effect vanished when males who might have fathered adolescent females were excluded from analysis. Adolescents did not differ consistently from adults in strength of the correlation between proximity maintenance (dyadic Hinde's Index) and copulation rate, or in approach rate to males. Adolescent females, relative to adult females, presented sexually more to rankless young males, but did not present more to ranked, resident males. Both proximate (e. g. endocrine) and ultimate (e. g. differential fecundity; female-female mate competition) explanations may account for the reported differences between adult and adolescent female rhesus macaque sexuality...|$|R
50|$|Presently, {{though the}} <b>mating</b> <b>seasons</b> overlap, the polar bear's season begins {{slightly}} {{earlier than the}} grizzly bear's. A blog columnist for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer suggested that more hybrids {{may be seen as}} global warming progresses and alters normal mating periods. The Canadian Wildlife Service noted that grizzly-polar hybrids born of zoo matings have proven fertile.|$|R
5|$|Male blue {{wildebeest}} become {{sexually mature}} at {{about two years}} of age while females can conceive at sixteen months if adequately nourished. Nevertheless, most females do not start to breed until a year later. The <b>mating</b> <b>season,</b> which lasts for about three weeks, coincides {{with the end of}} the rainy season. This means that the animals are in good condition, having been feeding on highly nutritious new grass growth, and the conception rate is often as high as 95%. The <b>mating</b> <b>season,</b> or rut, typically begins on the night of a full moon, suggesting that the lunar cycle influences breeding. At this time, testosterone production peaks in males, resulting in increased calling and territorial behaviour. The activities of these sexually excited males may also stimulate female to come into estrus.|$|E
5|$|Scent factors {{heavily into}} lemur reproduction. Scent-marking {{activity}} escalates during the <b>mating</b> <b>season.</b> Pheromones may coordinate reproductive timing for females coming into estrus. Mating {{can be either}} monogamous or promiscuous {{for both males and}} females, and mating can include individuals from outside the group. Monogamous lemurs include the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) and the mongoose lemur (E. mongoz), although the mongoose lemur has been observed mating outside of its pair bond. Monogamy is most common among nocturnal species, although some exhibit scramble competition, sexual suppression of subordinates, or competitions between males that avoid direct fighting. In mouse lemurs, males utilize sperm plugs, developed enlarged testes during the <b>mating</b> <b>season,</b> and develop size dimorphism (likely due to the enlarged testes). These indicate a mating system known as scramble competition polygyny, where males cannot defend females or the resources that might attract them.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} is diurnal (active mainly during the day), though it mainly rests or ruminates in dense undergrowth at noon.

5|$|Although wolf-dog {{hybridization}} in Europe {{has raised}} concern among conservation groups fearing for the gray wolf's purity, genetic tests show that introgression of dog genes into European gray wolf populations does {{not pose a}} significant threat.

50|$|Diapause in {{the tropics}} is often {{initiated}} in response to biotic rather than abiotic components. For example, food {{in the form of}} vertebrate carcasses may be more abundant following dry seasons, or oviposition sites in the form of fallen trees may be more available following rainy seasons. Also, diapause may serve to synchronize <b>mating</b> <b>seasons</b> or reduce competition, rather than to avoid unfavourable climatic conditions.|$|R
5|$|Contrary {{to initial}} reports of monogamy, ruffed lemurs {{in the wild}} exhibit {{seasonal}} polygamous breeding behavior, with {{both males and females}} mating with more than one partner within a single season. Mating is not restricted to just community members, but also involves members of neighboring communities. Females mate primarily with males with whom they had affiliative relations prior to <b>mating</b> <b>season,</b> although some matings occurred with roaming males from other communities.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>mating</b> <b>season,</b> rutting males bellow to {{make their}} {{presence}} known to females. Muskoxen roar during male-male fights, and male saigas force air through their noses, producing a roar to deter rival males and attract females. Mothers also use vocal communication to locate their calves if they get separated. During fights over dominance, males tend to display themselves in an erect posture with a level muzzle.|$|E
5|$|In {{their summer}} camps, {{starting}} in January, male grey-headed flying foxes set up mating territories. Mating territories are generally 3.5 body lengths along branches. These flying foxes' neck glands enlarge in {{males in the}} <b>mating</b> <b>season,</b> and are used to mark the territories. The males fight to maintain their territories, and this {{is associated with a}} steep drop in the males' body condition during this time.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} season lasts from November to December for bats that migrate northward during the summer, but from May to June in those that give birth in the south.

Gestation lasts about six months, and results in {{the birth of a}} single pup, during the time of local peak flower availability.|$|R
50|$|Polyphenic {{pigmentation}} is adaptive for insect {{species that}} undergo multiple <b>mating</b> <b>seasons</b> each year. Different pigmentation patterns provide appropriate camouflage throughout the seasons, {{as well as}} alter heat retention as temperatures change.

5|$|Over {{half the}} red-backed fairywrens {{in an area}} {{can be found in}} pairs during the <b>mating</b> <b>season.</b> This is {{apparently}} a defence against the resource-limited nature of the environment. It is more difficult to maintain a larger interdependent group during dry spells, so the birds try to stay in pairs or smaller groups, which include adults that help parents look after young. Paternity tests have shown that an older male with bright plumage has much more success in the <b>mating</b> <b>season</b> and can mate with more than one female. Accordingly, it has higher sperm storage and makes more mating overtures towards females. A male with browner and less bright plumage or a younger male with bright plumage has a much lower success rate than a bright, older male for mating. Further, an unpaired male serves as a helper to a mated pair in feeding and care of young. When the male pairs his bill darkens, and this happens within three weeks. This is much easier to control than plumage, as moulting takes time and is controlled by seasonality. The bill is vascular and much easier to change in response to the pairings.|$|E

The <b>mating</b> <b>season</b> lasts three to five months, but may last a year for older animals.|$|E
5|$|The alpine pika can emit three {{different}} vocalizations. The long call is heard during the <b>mating</b> <b>season</b> from only the subspecies O. a. alpina, O. a. changaica, and O. a. nitida.

The alarm call is given out immediately any danger from predators or humans is perceived, and can travel greater distances than the calls of most other pika species.|$|E
40|$|Prior {{research}} has shown that estrous female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatto) maintain spatial proximity preferentially to lower-ranking males. In this paper, 657 h of focal individual follows of 48 free-ranging estrous female rhesus macaques of two social groups during two <b>mating</b> <b>seasons</b> are used to evaluate the hypothesis that this phenomenon is attributable to female mate choice for novel males. This hypothesis is plausible because of the positive correlation between dominance rank and the length of time since a male immigrated into a group or matured in his natal group (i. e., his breeding tenure). However, partial correlation analysis showed that after removing the effect of dominance rank, there was no significant tendency for estrous females to maintain proximity preferentially to males of shorter breeding tenure. In contrast, removing the effect of breeding tenure did not eliminate the result that estrous females maintained proximity preferentially to lower ranking males. Novel (i. e., extra-group, new immigrant, and newly matured natal) males did not consistently experience more estrous female proximity maintenance than non-novel males, although sample sizes are too small to conclusively falsify this hypothesis. Within male-estrous female dyads, responsibility for proximity maintenance did not tend to shift from the female to the male between consecutive <b>mating</b> <b>seasons.</b> Male breeding tenure was not significantly correlated with year-to-year change in responsibility for proximity maintenance. Male breeding tenure was not consistently correlated with female sexual refusal. In one of two social groups, in one of two <b>mating</b> <b>seasons,</b> females appeared to choose novel males. These data provide, at most, weak support for the hypothesis that female primates in multi-male groups exercise mate choice for novel males. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
5|$|Like other minks, {{individual}} sea minks {{may have}} maintained home ranges, and, since the males were larger and required more food, males {{would have had}} larger territorial claims. Likewise, their larger size may have allowed the males to target larger prey than the females, {{and they may have}} had to defend females during <b>mating</b> <b>seasons.</b> Like other weasels, the sea mink was probably polygynandrous, with both sexes mating with multiple individuals.|$|R

5|$|The social {{structure}} of the golden-crowned sifaka {{is very similar to}} that of Verreaux's sifaka, both averaging between five and six individuals per group, with a range between three and ten. Unlike the Verreaux's sifaka, group sex ratios are more evenly balanced, consisting of two or more members of both sexes. Females are dominant within the group, and only one female breeds successfully each season. Males will roam between groups during the <b>mating</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vinkeniers use {{a variety}} of methods to {{increase}} the number of calls in their birds. Techniques to develop singing aptitude include selective breeding programs, high-protein diets, and stimulating them with music and recordings of bird song.

5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the <b>mating</b> <b>season,</b> adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E
50|$|Gila ditaenia, the Sonora chub is one {{of seven}} species of chub native to Arizona. This {{particular}} species {{is one of}} the smaller species of chub, rarely exceeding 200 millimeters in length. Most specimens in the United States never even exceed 125 millimeters. The Sonora chub’s body is typically very chubby, hence its name, with fusiform and terete implications in some species. Sonora chubs can be distinguished if one notices the unusually small scales. There are 63 to 75 scales in a lateral line. They have eight fin rays on their dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins with some variation between seven or nine. Their pharyngeal teeth can also distinguish them from other Arizona chubs. They are usually very dark in color with two noticeable black stripes running parallel above and below the lateral line. They also have counter-shading patterns with very light underbellies for camouflage. During <b>mating</b> <b>seasons,</b> they will have red markings on their paired and anal fins, with orange areas on their bellies. A round spot at the base of their tails can easily identify them during their <b>mating</b> <b>seasons</b> (Minckley 1973).|$|R
