40|$|ABSTRACT This paper reports {{inhibition}} of Na + + K+-sdmulated, ouabaininhibited adenosine triphosphatase (S-ATPase) in sheep red cell membranes by oxidized glutathione (GSSG). The {{results are consistent}} with the hypothesis that this inhibition depends upon the formation of a mixed disulfide between glutathione and-SH group(s) in the enzyme protein. Thus, {{inhibition of}} S-ATPase by GSSG proceeds more rapidly at alkaline than at neutral pH and is reversed by the addition of an excess of a compound containing reduced-SH groups (e. g. dithiothreitol).

However, it is complex in terms of computation time and is not oriented toward improving the network protection level. In order to include better levels of protection, new minimum interference routing algorithms are necessary. Minimizing the failure recovery time is also a complex process involving different failure recovery phases. Some of these phases depend completely on correct routing selection, such as minimizing the failure notification time. The level of protection also involves other aspects, such as the amount of resources used. In this case shared backup techniques should be considered. Therefore, minimum interference techniques should also be modified in order to include sharing resources for protection in their objectives. These aspects are reviewed and analyzed in this article, and a new proposal combining minimum interference with fast protection using shared segment backups is introduced.

40|$|International audienceMitochondria from {{transgenic}} mice, expressing enzymatically active mitochondrial {{creatine kinase}} in liver, were analyzed for {{opening of the}} permeability transition pore in the absence and presence of creatine kinase substrates but with no external adenine nucleotides added. In mitochondria from these transgenic mice, cyclosporin A-inhibited pore opening was delayed by creatine or cyclocreatine but not by beta-guanidinopropionic acid. This observation correlated with the ability of these substrates to stimulate state 3 respiration {{in the presence of}} extramitochondrial ATP. The dependence of transition pore opening on calcium and magnesium concentration was studied in the presence and absence of creatine. If mitochondrial creatine kinase activity decreased (i. e. by omitting magnesium from the <b>medium),</b> <b>protection</b> of permeability transition pore opening by creatine or cyclocreatine was no longer seen. Likewise, when creatine kinase was added externally to liver mitochondria from wild-type mice that do not express mitochondrial creatine kinase in liver, no protective effect on pore opening by creatine and its analog was observed. All these findings indicate that mitochondrial creatine kinase activity located within the intermembrane and intercristae space, in conjunction with its tight functional coupling to oxidative phosphorylation, via the adenine nucleotide translocase, can modulate mitochondrial permeability transition in the presence of creatine. These results are of relevance for the design of creatine analogs for cell protection as potential adjuvant therapeutic tools against neurodegenerative diseases...|$|E

In order to determine levels of protection, 11 countries, which {{are thought to have}} {{a significant role in the}} world agricultural markets and/or in terms of protectionism, were selected. These countries were grouped as low, medium and high protection countries, based on their Nominal Assistance Coefficients. Further, differing applications and specific conditions of those countries were discussed. Producer Support Estimate Percentages, Nominal Assistance Coefficient and Nominal Protection Coefficient were used to analyze changes in the protection level of the countries. Nominal Assistance Coefficients are found to be as follows: 1, 04 - 1, 11 in low protection countries (Australia, Brazil, China), 1, 16 - 1, 43 in <b>medium</b> <b>protection</b> countries (United States of America, European Union, Canada, Russia, Turkey) and 2, 12 - 2, 76 in high protection countries (South Korea, Switzerland, Japan). Although share of decoupled payments in support compositions increases, share of market price supports causing price distortions is still high. Furthermore, it was also observed that importance of environmental issues is increasing in almost all countries. Based on nominal protection coefficient, it can be said that countries are protecting staple crops more. In this case, concerns of the countries on being self sufficient at least for these crops and decreasing their dependency on world markets are affecting the decisions of those countries. Hence, it can be concluded that agriculture will remain as the most controversial issue in free trade negotiations. ...|$|E

All compared isoniazid (6 - 12 months) with placebo, and one trial also compared multidrug treatment for 3 months with placebo. Mean follow up was 15 - 33 months. Overall, frequency of tuberculosis (relative risk 0. 57, 95 % confidence interval 0. 41 to 0. 79) was reduced in those receiving preventive. treatment compared with placebo: mortality was not significantly reduced (0. 93, 0. 83 to 1. 05), In subjects positive for purified protein derivative receiving preventive treatment, the risk of tuberculosis was reduced substantially (0. 32, 0. 19 to 0. 51) {{and the risk of}} death was reduced moderately (0. 73, 0. 57 to 0. 95) compared with those taking placebo. In adults negative for purified protein derivative receiving preventive treatment, the risk of tuberculosis (0. 82, 0. 50 to 1. 36) and the risk of death (1. 02, 0. 89 to 1. 17) were not reduced significantly. Adverse drug reactions were more frequent, but not significantly so, in patients receiving drug compared with placebo (1. 45, 0. 98 to 2. 14), Conclusions: Preventive treatment given for 3 - 12 months protects against tuberculosis in adults infected with HIV, {{at least in the short}} to <b>medium</b> term. <b>Protection</b> is greatest in subjects positive for purified protein derivative, in whom death is also less frequent. Long term benefits remain to be shown. 5 page(s...|$|R
