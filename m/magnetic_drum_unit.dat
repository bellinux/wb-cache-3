5000|$|The IBM 701 {{computer}} (1952-1956) had a [...] "Load" [...] {{button that}} initiated {{reading of the}} first 36-bit word into main memory from a punched card in a card reader, a magnetic tape in a tape drive, or a <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>unit,</b> depending on {{the position of the}} Load Selector switch. The left 18-bit half-word was then executed as an instruction, which usually read additional words into memory. The loaded boot program was then executed, which, in turn, loaded a larger program from that medium into memory without further help from the human operator. The term [...] "boot" [...] has been used in this sense since at least 1958.|$|E

50|$|The ALWAC III-E was {{an early}} {{commercial}} vacuum tube computer employing a rotating <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> main storage <b>unit.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{free-standing}} console is also provided, {{which includes}} binary displays of the machine's registers and switches to boot and debug programs. User input is by a Teletype Model 35 ASR unit and a high-speed paper tape reader (300 cps). Most systems {{include at least}} two magnetic tape drives, operating at up to 75 inches/second at 800 bpi. The normal variety of peripherals is also available, including <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>units,</b> card readers and punches, and an extensive set of analog-digital/digital-analog conversion devices. A (vector mode) graphic display unit is also available, {{but it does not}} include a means of keyboard input.|$|R
50|$|The Processor is an {{independent}} CPU (with a different instruction set from the Computers) and provides control for 12 to 24 <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> storage <b>units,</b> four to forty UNISERVO II tape drives, two Electronic page recorders, one or two high-speed printers, and a high-speed punched card reader.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{improvements}} of the 709 {{over the}} previous 704 involved more magnetic core memory and apparently the first use of independent I/O channels. Whereas I/O on 704 is a programmed function of the central processor - data words are transferred to or from the I/O register, one at a time, using a [...] "copy" [...] instruction - the 709 uses the IBM-766 Data Synchronizer, which provides two independently [...] "programmed" [...] I/O channels. Up to three Data Synchronizers can be attached to a 709, each able to control up to 20 IBM 729 tape drives and an IBM 716 alphanumeric line printer, IBM 711 card-reader and 721 card punch. This allows six times as many I/O devices on 709, and allows I/O to proceed on multiple devices while program execution continues in parallel. Up to two IBM 733 <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Drum</b> <b>units,</b> each with 8,192 words of memory, could be attached independently from the Data Synchronizers. The 709 could initially load programs (boot) from card, tape or drum.|$|R
50|$|The MARS-1 {{system was}} created by Mamoru Hosaka, Yutaka Ohno {{and others at the}} Railway Technical Research Institute in the 1950s, and was {{produced}} by Hitachi in 1958.
