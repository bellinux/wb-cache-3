5|$|In 1976, a Hanford {{technician}} named Harold McCluskey {{received the}} largest recorded dose of americium following a laboratory accident. Due to prompt <b>medical</b> <b>intervention,</b> he survived the incident and died eleven years later of natural causes.|$|E
5|$|On 31 July, {{the hunger}} strike began to break, {{when the mother}} of Paddy Quinn insisted on <b>medical</b> <b>intervention</b> to save his life. The {{following}} day Kevin Lynch died, followed by Kieran Doherty on 2 August, Thomas McElwee on 8 August and Michael Devine on 20 August. On the day Devine died, Sands' election agent Owen Carron won the Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election with an increased number of votes.|$|E
5|$|Prostaglandins, local hormones {{produced}} in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes {{are responsible for the}} aggregation of platelets that form blood clots. Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective <b>medical</b> <b>intervention</b> for acute myocardial infarction.|$|E
5000|$|Between December 2015 and August 2016, the Chilean Ministry of Health {{issued a}} {{regulatory}} suspension of non-necessary cosmetic <b>medical</b> <b>interventions</b> on intersex children.

50|$|In 2015, Chile briefly {{became the}} second country to protect {{intersex}} {{infants and children}} from unnecessary <b>medical</b> <b>interventions,</b> following Malta, however, the regulations were superseded the following year by guidance permitting intersex <b>medical</b> <b>interventions.</b>|$|R
25|$|Intersex {{people in}} the United Kingdom face {{significant}} gaps, particularly in protection from non-consensual <b>medical</b> <b>interventions,</b> and protection from discrimination. Actions by intersex civil society organizations aim to eliminate unnecessary <b>medical</b> <b>interventions</b> and harmful practices, promote social acceptance, and equality in line with Council of Europe and United Nations demands.|$|R
5|$|Without <b>medical</b> <b>intervention,</b> {{the male}} {{fertility}} rate after SCI is 5–14%, but the rate increases with treatments. Even with all available medical interventions, {{fewer than half}} of men with SCI can father children. Assisted insemination is usually required. As with erection, therapies used to treat infertility in uninjured men are used for those with SCI.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September, {{the family}} of Laurence McKeown became the fourth family to {{intervene}} and asked for medical treatment to save his life, and Cahal Daly issued a statement calling on republican prisoners to end the hunger strike. A week later, James Prior replaced Humphrey Atkins as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and met with prisoners {{in an attempt to}} end the strike. Liam McCloskey ended his strike on 26 September after his family said they would ask for <b>medical</b> <b>intervention</b> if he became unconscious, and {{it became clear that the}} families of the remaining hunger strikers would also intervene to save their lives.|$|E
5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial <b>medical</b> <b>intervention</b> is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E
50|$|Australia was {{the first}} country to conduct a {{parliamentary}} inquiry into involuntary or coerced <b>medical</b> <b>interventions</b> on intersex people. A recent Family Court case authorising a gonadectomy and consequential surgery on a young child has attracted public commentary for disclosing those <b>medical</b> <b>interventions,</b> their rationales, and a prior clitorectomy and labiaplasty.|$|R

25|$|Y-linked {{disorders}} are exceedingly rare {{but the most}} well-known examples typically cause infertility. Reproduction in such conditions is only possible through the circumvention of infertility by <b>medical</b> <b>intervention.</b>|$|E

25|$|If the {{condition}} thickens, turns red and irritated, starts spreading, appears on other body parts, {{or if the}} baby develops thrush (fungal mouth infection), fungal ear infection (an ear infection that does not respond to antibiotics) or a persistent diaper rash, <b>medical</b> <b>intervention</b> is recommended.|$|E
25|$|In {{a variety}} of studies, nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDS), like aspirin, have shown evidence of preventing esophageal cancer in people with Barrett's esophagus. However, none of these studies have been randomized, placebo-controlled trials, which are considered {{the gold standard for}} evaluating a <b>medical</b> <b>intervention.</b> In addition, the best dose of NSAIDs for cancer prevention is not yet known.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent decades}} {{it has become}} {{possible}} to reassign sex surgically. Some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such <b>medical</b> <b>intervention</b> to have their physiological sex match their gender identity; others retain the genitalia they were born with (see transsexual {{for some of the}} possible reasons) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity.|$|E

25|$|Symphysiotomy is a {{surgical}} procedure {{in which the}} cartilage of the pubic symphysis is divided to widen the pelvis allowing childbirth {{when there is a}} mechanical problem.

25|$|The most {{important}} medical {{is the one}} before starting diving, as the diver can be screened to prevent exposure when a dangerous condition exists.

25|$|Almost any {{medication}} {{involved with}} serotonin regulation {{has the potential}} to cause serotonin toxicity (also known as serotonin syndrome) an excess of serotonin that can induce mania, restlessness, agitation, emotional lability, insomnia and confusion as its primary symptoms. Although the condition is serious, it is not particularly common, generally only appearing at high doses or while on other medications. Assuming proper <b>medical</b> <b>intervention</b> has been taken (within about 24hours) it is rarely fatal.|$|E
25|$|Special Operations Teams deploy to multi-casualty {{incidents}} and disasters. While other agencies may {{be trained to}} do similar, the very important distinction is the staff of NSW Ambulance also provide life saving <b>medical</b> <b>intervention</b> {{to those who are}} lost, trapped or in a precarious situation. This is especially important as Fire and Rescue NSW personnel are generally Basic Life Support (BLS) trained hence not being trained to provide acceptable levels of professional clinical care.|$|E
