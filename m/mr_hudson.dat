25|$|The song {{peaked at}} number 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and hit {{number one on}} both the US Billboard Hot Rap Songs and Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs charts. The song has since been {{certified}} quadruple Platinum for four million digital sales in the US as of August 2016. A music video directed by Australian director Nabil Elderkin was released on June 6, 2012. The highly stylized video shows a long take of all four rappers featured on the song, along with other GOOD Music recording artists such as Cyhi the Prynce, Kid Cudi, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hudson</b> and Teyana Taylor in cameos. The video features the rappers giving their verses and dancing around, with deliberate editing {{to make it appear}} as if they are disappearing and reappearing behind walls. The video received positive reviews from critics.|$|E
25|$|After an {{interlude}} by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hudson,</b> furious {{about the}} need to re-shoot the first scene, the scene continues from where it left off. The rally car speeds up continuing the donuts that ended the first scene before speeding to the far left corner of the arena where a police car suddenly appears. The rally car brakes with just centimetres to spare. It then reverses half the width of the arena before performing a reverse-180 turn and driving towards the second police car at the far right of the arena. The rally car then speeds up to the left end of the arena with the second police car following it. At this point the rally car drifts the corner before returning to the right side performing a 180 skid to park the car perpendicular with the right wall. The two police cars follow performing the same manoeuvre resulting in the three cars being in parallel with each other. The rally car first races off the arena through the centre exit. The police cars then meet in the middle and perform donuts, with the nose of each car nearly touching the next, before following the exit of the rally car. At this point the motorcyclist makes his return by shooting a third police car with his gun, which causes it to split in half.|$|E

500|$|Future and Cyrus {{had first}} collaborated {{on the track}} [...] "My Darlin'" [...] for Cyrus' fourth studio album Bangerz (2013). The lyrics of [...] "My Darlin'" [...] concern the angst {{following}} a failed relationship and the simultaneous desire to reconcile. Later, Cyrus expressed interest in [...] "Real and True", recording her vocals for the chorus. <b>Mr</b> <b>Hudson</b> also recorded vocals for the chorus, which were incorporated with Cyrus' singing.

500|$|... "Why I Love You" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. AbsolutePunk's Ian Walker described the track as an [...] "album spotlight", {{and stated that}} it's [...] "carried by a dramatic, driving chorus from famed R artist <b>Mr</b> <b>Hudson</b> and, while featuring one of Jay's weakest verses on the entire album, showcases a surprisingly strong back-and-forth from the two headlining artists towards the end." [...] Rob Harvilla of Spin commented that [...] "Why I Love You" [...] closes out the album proper with a monster Cassius-lifted chorus." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated that the song is [...] "pure pop aggrandisement", musing that [...] "this rather enjoyable piece of maximalism feels quite at home on an album writ so large, both in sound and verse, that a planetarium was deemed the only fitting venue for its first playback." [...] Craig Jenkins of Prefix wrote that [...] "Mike Dean's titanic, Cassius-sampling [...] "Why I Love You" [...] slowly peels layers off its stuffy largess to reveal the gorgeous string accompaniment underfoot. Kanye and his team are still trafficking in proggy, kitchen-sink experimentation, and Kanye's transformation into rap's own ELO is nearly complete." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Kyle Anderson was less enthusiastic about the track, writing that [...] "Everything falls apart on the album-closing [...] "Why I Love You," [...] which cranks up West's love of prog-rock bombast {{so much that it}} sounds like guest crooner <b>Mr</b> <b>Hudson</b> is trying to sing the hook over a poorly recorded bootleg of a Muse concert." ...|$|E

When asked {{about why he}} uploaded the songs in that way, he replied; [...] "I don't want to seem like I have a cause against genres, or maybe I do... Bluegrass is swag. Bluegrass is all the way swag." [...] Ocean described the making of his mixtape as a labor of love, stating that [...] "It was like difficult to make. Not like writing the songs [...] arranging the songs. That had a level of difficulty, too. But just piecing together all the levels {{to do it at}} the level, the quality of records I wanted to make… But, it was a process I appreciate so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Jay-Z and West {{worked with}} several guest {{recording}} artists, including Beyoncé, Frank Ocean, and <b>Mr</b> <b>Hudson.</b> [...] "No Church in the Wild", the last song recorded for the album, was conceived by Jay-Z, West, and the song's producer 88-Keys {{throughout most of}} June. Producer and recording artist The-Dream sings a verse on the track using AutoTune. The song features R singer Frank Ocean, who released his debut mixtape nostalgia,ULTRA in early 2011 to critical acclaim. The release of the mixtape interested Jay-Z and West. Jay-Z's wife Beyoncé recommended {{the involvement of the}} singer in particular, who appears on both [...] "No Church in the Wild" [...] and [...] "Made in America."

5000|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Hudson</b> {{retained}} the middle section of allotment 12 until 1876. Photographic evidence reveals several structures extant {{on the site}} whether any of these survive {{as part of the}} present brick and timber building has not been established, although it is possible. In April 1869 <b>Mrs</b> <b>Hudson</b> had advertised to let Borger's old blacksmith's shop adjoining the Royal Exchange Hotel, (the hotel was on the southwest corner of Fitzroy and Palmerin Streets, on the site later occupied by the Bank of New South Wales). Warwick historian Thomas Hall recalled in 1925 that Henry Borger opened a blacksmith's shop in Fitzroy Street, and it may have been on that part of allotment 12 which <b>Mrs</b> <b>Hudson</b> still held in 1869.|$|R
500|$|On October 16, West {{released}} {{an excerpt of}} [...] "Coldest Winter" [...] on the radio station Power 106 in Los Angeles.

500|$|... "Why I Love You" [...] {{is a song}} by American hip hop artists Kanye West and Jay-Z, {{from their}} first {{collaborative}} album Watch the Throne (2011). The song features pop musician <b>Mr</b> <b>Hudson</b> who is signed to West's GOOD Music label. [...] "Why I Love You" [...] heavily samples French house duo Cassius' 2010 single [...] "I <3 U So", which itself is based upon a sample from the original 1971 version of [...] "I Feel a Song (In My Heart)" [...] by Sandra Richardson. The song almost entirely features Jay-Z rapping and only contains a few lines provided by West. Lyrically, the song is {{about the people who}} have stood in the way of Jay-Z throughout the year and expresses themes of victory and anger. The song received positive reviews from critics who generally praised the production.|$|E
500|$|The mixtape also {{contains}} several references to American director Stanley Kubrick and his films, most notably Eyes Wide Shut.

[...] The film is also referenced on the track [...] "Novacane", where Ocean also sings that he's [...] "feelin like Stanley Kubrick". Following that is the track [...] "There Will Be Tears". The song {{has been described as}} emotional in nature, containing a glitchy beat sampled from <b>Mr</b> <b>Hudson,</b> with heavily synthesised vocals. [...] "There Will Be Tears" [...] has a thundering bass flat over a hyperactive 808 beat. Ocean sings about not having a father; [...] "Hide my face, hide my face, can't let 'em see me crying / Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither / And they weren't crying", where he [...] "lets his guard down completely." ...|$|E
