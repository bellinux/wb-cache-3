25|$|Walter Lowrie reminds {{the reader}} that Kierkegaard has said, 'With <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> I held out the Edifying Discourses, with my left the {{aesthetic}} works-and all grasped with the right hand what I held in my left.’ This would pair right and left as Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions and Stages on Life’s Way, then Three Discourses in Various Spirits with A Literary Review; and The Lilies of the Field and the Birds of the Air with Either/Or, 2nd edition. He indicates a plan to Kierkegaard's writing.|$|E
25|$|A {{line from}} Shakespeare has {{sometimes}} been taken to mean that he was deaf in one ear: Come on <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> for this ear is deaf. No classical source mentions hearing impairment in connection with Caesar. The playwright may have been making metaphorical use of a passage in Plutarch that does not refer to deafness at all, but rather to a gesture Alexander of Macedon customarily made. By covering his ear, Alexander indicated that he had turned his attention from an accusation in order to hear the defence.|$|E
500|$|According to the Book of Acts, , after Jesus' resurrection and ascension, he was [...] "exalted to {{the right}} hand of God." [...] Preaching on the Day of Pentecost, Peter saw Jesus' exaltation as a {{fulfilment}} of Psalm 110:1, The LORD says to my Lord: [...] "Sit at <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet." [...] In the Bible, the [...] "right hand" [...] is the special place of honour.|$|E

500|$|After {{retirement}} from first-class cricket {{at the end}} of the 1960 season in England, McCool returned to Australia, taking up market gardening with a specialty in rare blooms at Umina Beach on the Central Coast of New South Wales. He continued playing club cricket in the Newcastle competition for Belmont until rheumatism forced him to retire from all forms of cricket aged 55: [...] "Rheumatism in <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> made it embarrassing for me to continue. [...] It was alarming to an old pro like me who prided himself on length and directions to have the ball slip out of my fingers out of control." ...|$|E
500|$|From {{the start}} of the war until early 1862, when {{responsibility}} was passed to the War Department, Seward was in charge of determining who should be detained without charges or trial. Approximately 800 men and a few women, believed to be Southern sympathizers or spies, were detained, usually at the initiation of local officials. [...] Once Seward was informed, he would often order that the prisoner be transferred to federal authorities. Seward was reported to have boasted to Lord Lyons that [...] "I can touch a bell on <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> and order the arrest of a citizen... and no power on earth, except that of the President, can release them. [...] Can the Queen of England do so much?" ...|$|E
500|$|This episode reintroduces and {{resolves}} Veronica's rape, introduced {{earlier in}} the season. However, it had been largely ignored until {{this point in the}} series. The episode was the third and final episode of the series directed by Marcos Siega, after [...] "Drinking the Kool-Aid" [...] and [...] "Mars vs. Mars". In addition, the episode marks regular writer Diane Ruggiero's sixth writing credit for the show. After the episode aired, Rob Thomas called the episode [...] "our high-water mark". Commenting on Ruggiero writing the episode, he stated, [...] "She was really <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> writing the series, and it felt good to have someone who knew the voices as well as I did. We were both in a comfort zone, both writing this show and writing with each other." ...|$|E

500|$|Silver himself {{commented that}} {{inspiration}} came from multiple sources: [...] "I'm inspired by nature and {{by some of}} the people I meet and some of the events that take place in my life. I'm inspired by my mentors. I'm inspired by various religious doctrines. [...] Many of my songs are impressed on my mind just before I wake up. Others I get from just doodlin' around on the piano". He also wrote that, [...] "when I wake up with a melody in my head, I jump right out of bed before I forget it and run to the piano and my tape recorder. I play the melody with <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and then harmonize it with my left. I put it down on my tape recorder, and then I work on getting a bridge or eightbar release for the tune." ...|$|E
500|$|Yitzhak Azulay {{composed}} the music played in Fill the Void. He chose primarily melodic and traditional pieces, using them frequently throughout the film. Other soundtrack is composed largely of contemporary Orthodox pop music, and the prayers are [...] "regularly chanted rather than spoken". The song [...] "Im Eshkachech Yerushalayim" [...] (Hebrew: אם אשכחך ירושלים, 'If I Forget Thee Jerusalem') features {{prominently in the}} film, playing at {{all three of the}} major events: the funeral, the Bris Milah, and the wedding. Azulay used an a cappella version of the song, which is derived from an excerpt of Psalm 137 and expresses the yearnings of the Jewish people in exile following the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BCE: [...] "If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> wither; Let my tongue stick to my palate if I cease to think of you, if I do not keep Jerusalem in memory even at my happiest hour." ...|$|E

2500|$|Green's {{retirement}} from boxing ended {{when he met}} South African Anthony van Niekerk in Perth for a light-heavyweight bout on 26 April 2009. Green made a positive start to the bout and dropped his opponent {{in the second round}} with an [...] "effective combination". Niekerk beat the count, however {{near the end of the}} second round Green delivered an overhand right that forced the referee to stop the fight. Speaking from the ring, Green told the crowd [...] "I’m back guys – it was great to be in the ring and <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> was a potent weapon in there tonight." ...|$|E

One of my knees, I think the left went into the water. This pissed me {{off a little bit}} and I opened my knife, it was in my left hand and I stabbed Lauren in {{the left side of the}} neck. I said in my interview that it was the right side of the neck with <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> but I am been thinking since. It wasn't my right thumb which was cut but my left. After a couple of seconds after I stabbed her she stopped moving." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Mordechai {{continued}} {{to serve as}} his brother's right hand after the war, refusing to take a rabbinical position but dedicating his efforts to strengthening Torah Judaism and Belzer Hasidut. He chaired the Rebbe's planning committee for the first Belz Talmud Torah in Tel Aviv and yeshiva in Jerusalem, and represented the Rebbe at most events and conferences. The Rebbe consulted with him before every major decision. He also acceded to the Rebbe's request to live near him in Tel Aviv, even after he remarried, as the Rebbe explained, [...] "Heaven forbid that he leave me!

6000|$|A {{score of}} retorts, all deliciously inadvisable, tickled my tongue, so I said nothing, contenting myself with holding {{on with my}} left hand while I nursed <b>my</b> {{stinging}} <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> under <b>my</b> arm-pit. Beyond her, across {{the floor of the}} main cabin, I saw the steward in pursuit of Captain West's Bible and a sheaf of Miss West's music.

2500|$|British occultist Aleister Crowley {{reported}} witnessing what {{he referred}} to as [...] "globular electricity" [...] during a thunderstorm on Lake Pasquaney in New Hampshire in 1916.

As I looked at it, it exploded with a sharp report quite impossible to confuse with the continuous turmoil of the lightning, thunder and hail, or that of the lashed water and smashed wood which was creating a pandemonium outside the cottage. I felt a very slight shock in the middle of <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> which was closer to the globe than any other part of my body." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} sports in India {{dates back to}} the Vedic era. Physical culture in ancient India was fuelled by {{religious}} rights. The mantra in the Atharvaveda, says, [...] "Duty is in <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and the fruits of victory in my left." [...] In terms of an ideal, these words hold the same sentiments as the traditional Olympic Oath: [...] "For the Honour of my Country and the Glory of Sport." [...] Badminton probably originated in India as a grownup's version of a very old children's game known in England as battledore and shuttlecock, the battledore being a paddle and the shuttlecock a small feathered cork, now usually called a [...] "bird." [...] Games like chess (chaturanga), snakes and ladders, playing cards, originated in India, and it was from here that these games were transmitted to foreign countries, where they were further modernised.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Powell {{left the}} University of Texas {{to take a}} {{position}} as a curator at the National Gallery of Art (NGA). The NGA's director at the time, J. Carter Brown, recruited Powell away from teaching. [...] "I first spotted (Powell) in Austin, Texas. It occurred to me that he had rare potential, someone who had a passion for art, but yet had his feet on the ground. He was a people person, yet he could also handle the administrative details...," [...] Brown later said. Powell stayed at the NGA for four years, rising to the position of executive curator in 1979. Brown later said, [...] "Rusty was <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> for years". During his time as curator, Powell organized some of the NGA's biggest exhibitions, including [...] "The Splendor of Dresden: Five Centuries of Art Collecting" [...] in 1978 and [...] "American Light: The Luminist Movement" [...] in 1980.|$|E

2500|$|On March 10, 2007, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed claimed responsibility, {{before his}} Combatant Status Review Tribunal at Guantanamo Bay, {{for the murder}} of Daniel Pearl. He is an alleged Al Qaeda {{operative}} reported to be third in command under Osama bin Laden, mastermind of the 2001 attacks. He claimed to have beheaded Pearl. In a confession read during his Tribunal hearing, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said, [...] "I decapitated with <b>my</b> blessed <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> the head of the American Jew Daniel Pearl, in the city of Karachi, Pakistan."

[...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And thanks very much for having me. It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|E
2500|$|The Pesikta de-Rav Kahana cited [...] for the {{proposition}} that God's fate and Israel's fate are intertwined. According to Bar Kappara, God told Israel that the time of God's redemption (when God would release God's right hand, which was restrained while Israel is in exile) was in Israel's hand, {{and the time of}} Israel's redemption was in God's hand. As the time of God's redemption (and action) was in Israel's hand, therefore, Israel should heed the words of [...] "let not your heart grow haughty so that you forget the Lord your God." [...] And that the time of Israel's redemption was in God's hand was seen in [...] "If I forget you, O Jerusalem, <b>My</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> will forget." [...] To Rabbi Dosa, this verse meant that God said that if God forgot Jerusalem, God's right hand would forget how to perform miracles (and God would thus cease to be God).|$|E
2500|$|Caster was optioned by the Athletics to the Portland Beavers for the 1936 season, {{which proved}} to be the best of Caster's career. [...] In 44 games for Portland, he {{compiled}} a 25–13 record and a 2.79 ERA – a career high in wins and a career low in ERA. [...] He was the leader in the Pacific Coast League in 1936 in both wins and strikeouts (234). [...] In a front page profile, The Sporting News credited Caster's turnaround to overcoming his lack of control and adding a slow knuckleball to his blazing fastball and sharp-breaking curve. [...] Caster later wrote an article describing the role of his knuckler:"My knuckle ball is thrown with the fingertips of my index and second finger on <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> in contact with the smooth surface of the ball – no seems touched... I have found when pitching against the wind the ball seems to be most effective because it seems to 'flutter'... I regard the fast ball as my best pitch, with my knuckle ball as the change pitch." ...|$|E

My youthful experiences with the atrocities of the Second World War are with me,- but I wanted to forget them and live a [...] "normal" [...] life and adapt into society more fully.
