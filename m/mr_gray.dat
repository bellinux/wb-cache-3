5|$|A {{preliminary}} enquiry into Magdalenas {{was held}} at Rio de Janeiro by the British Consul-General, who sent {{a report to the}} Minister of Transport, who ordered that a Court of Formal Investigation be held. The enquiry {{was held at}} the Royal Courts of Justice, London on 26–28 September 1949 with J. V. Naisby KC in charge, assisted by Captains Grimston and Williamson, and a <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gray.</b> Evidence was heard that the ship was seaworthy, and that the provision of rescue equipment on board either met or exceeded the required standard. The course selected was deemed to be correct, but the navigation of the ship was defective, with insufficient attention being paid to compass errors. Her captain had his master's certificate suspended for two years. Her first officer had his certificate suspended for a year, being allowed to hold a second mate's certificate during this time. These suspensions were effective from the date of the report's release on 3 October 1949.|$|E
25|$|If {{the subject}} of a Poem is obscure, or not {{generally}} known, or not interesting, and if it abounds with allusions, and facts of this improper, and uninteresting character, the writer who chuses the subject, and introduces those improper, and unaffecting allusions, and facts, betrays a great want of poetical judgment, and taste. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gray</b> had a vitiated fondness for such insipid fable, narrative, and references.|$|E

2500|$|Gray was a keen {{student of}} medieval history, {{and in time}} came to make a {{particular}} study of the oldest Welsh poetry, though without actually learning the language. [...] Several pages of his commonplace books are devoted to notes on Welsh prosody, and he also mentioned there a legend, now considered quite unhistorical, which he had come across in Thomas Carte's A General History of England (1747–1755). [...] When Edward I conquered Wales, [...] "he is said", wrote Gray, [...] "to have hanged up all their Bards, because they encouraged the Nation to rebellion, but their works (we see), still remain, the Language (tho' decaying) still lives, {{and the art of}} their versification is known, and practised to this day among them". [...] Gray also studied early Scandinavian literature, and found in one Old Norse poem the refrain [...] "'Vindum vindum/ Vef Darradar'", which was to reappear in The Bard as [...] "Weave the warp and weave the woof". [...] In 1755 he began work on The Bard, and by August of that year had completed two thirds of the poem. [...] Initially he worked with a speed and a sense of identification that were both unusual for him. [...] "I felt myself the Bard", he declared. [...] But composing the third and final strophe proved more difficult, and he eventually ground to a halt. [...] For two years the poem remained unfinished, but then in 1757 he attended a concert by John Parry, a blind harpist who claimed that the traditional Welsh harp repertoire went back as far as the druids. [...] Gray was so inspired by this experience that he returned to The Bard with new enthusiasm, and was soon able to tell his friend William Mason, [...] "Mr Parry, you must know, has set my Ode in motion again, and has brought it at last to a conclusion." [...] Gray sold the copyright of this poem and of his [...] "The Progress of Poesy" [...] to the publisher Robert Dodsley for 40 guineas, and Dodsley issued them together under the title Odes by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gray.</b> [...] The book was printed by Gray's friend Horace Walpole who had just set up a printing press at his home, Strawberry Hill, and who had set his heart on inaugurating the enterprise with Gray's poems. [...] The Odes were published on 8 August 1757 as a handsome quarto, with a print run of 2000 copies priced at one shilling. [...] Walpole prevailed on Gray to add four footnotes to The Bard for the first edition, though Gray told Walpole, [...] "I do not love notes…They are signs of weakness and obscurity. [...] If a thing cannot be understood without them, it had better not be understood at all." [...] These proved, for many readers, inadequate to explain the poem, and Gray complacently wrote to Mason [...] "nobody understands me, and I am perfectly satisfied." [...] Rather against his will, he was persuaded to add a few more notes for the 1768 edition.|$|E

He confronts <b>Mrs</b> <b>Gray</b> at the station, admitting that he lives from one meeting to the next, and she confesses that she's exactly the same, and that's the reason why she's leaving.

60|$|Mr. George {{seemed at}} first quite {{unwilling to accept}} this proposal.

60|$|But {{the room}} which {{interested}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Gray</b> and Rosie most, was {{what is called}} the Gem Room. It contains all the gems and jewelry, and other personal ornaments, that were found at Herculaneum and Pompeii, as well as a great many other very curious things. There were rings, bracelets, and necklaces, made of gold, and adorned with precious stones; and there were a great many signets and other gems engraved in the most delicate and exquisite manner. These things were all arranged in glass cases, so that they could be seen to great advantage, but they could not be touched. There were a great many other curious things in this room; and there were also a great many other very curious rooms, all of which <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Gray</b> and the children walked through, though there were so many things to be seen in them, that, in the end, they became quite bewildered. In the mean time the hours passed away, and at length <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Gray,</b> looking at her watch, said it was nearly four o'clock, which was the hour for the museum to be closed. So they did not go into any more rooms, but concluded to go home. They went down the great staircase, towards the entrance door, and then, after stopping to get <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Gray's</b> parasol, they took a carriage and drove home. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Gray</b> said that she had seen the museum, but not the things that were in it.|$|R
