40|$|This report studies {{whether the}} peer <b>monitoring</b> <b>arrangement</b> in the Stability Growth Pact (SGP) can {{decrease}} {{negative effects of}} moral hazard. Theory argues that peer monitoring can reduce moral hazard issues, because peers {{have the same kind}} of knowledge and expertise. Peers are therefore less hampered by information asymmetry as apposed to a vertical regulator. Moreover, peers are argued to be willing to regulate one another, as they share risks. However, based on an institutional analysis and a case study, this research project shows that these assumptions are not true for the case of the SGP. Strategic behaviour of peers reduces the willingness and creates information asymmetry. As a result, the peer <b>monitoring</b> <b>arrangement</b> in the SGP has a limited ability to decrease the negative effects of moral hazard. To improve the effectiveness of this peer <b>monitoring</b> <b>arrangement</b> this reports argues to implement more checks and balances so that peers have less opportunity to replace regulatory procedures with political games.

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the lack of}} coordination between ministries, there is a wide knowledge gap between government-level offices and investors, leading to a rushed and superficial investment review. Many government agencies initially overwhelmed by the deluge of investment proposals failed to properly screen out non-viable proposals. Due to the knowledge gaps between government agencies and investors, “in most countries it is implicitly presumed that investors will have the right incentive and be the best qualified to assess economic viability,” leading to a lack of reporting requirements or <b>monitoring</b> <b>arrangements,</b> key information on land uses and value of the investment, and checks on economic viability. The Sudanese government has been noted as having paid minimal attention to existing land rights and neglecting to conduct any economic analysis on potential projects.

5000|$|In England in 1980 lawyer Larry Gostin {{called for}} psychosurgery {{to be subject}} to [...] "the strictest legal and ethical scrutiny". He {{identified}} a number of problems with the newer forms of psychosurgery: the lack of any reliable theoretical position relating to psychosurgery, with different forms of surgery used in similar cases, and similar surgery used {{for a wide range of}} psychiatric conditions; the absence of controlled trials; the difficulty in assessing changes in character caused by the surgery; and the irreversible nature of surgery on brain tissue that appeared to be structurally normal. In spite of these ethical concerns, he noted, there had never been in the UK any [...] "guidelines, controls, regulations or <b>monitoring</b> <b>arrangements</b> relating to its use". Gostin argued that psychosurgery should only be given with the consent of the patient and approval of an independent body comprising a multi-disciplinary legal and lay element.

40|$|With {{embedded}} systems growing in {{hardware and software}} complexity, {{it is becoming increasingly}} difficult to avoid failures, despite costly design and testing efforts. Monitoring the behaviour of an embedded system 2 ̆ 7 s software is useful both during the product testing phase and in the field environment and can contribute to confidence in the overall system. Run-time verification combines monitoring with formal methods by checking specified rules against run-time observations. Embedded systems pose some problems for run-time verification, as their limited resources may preclude internal monitoring features and their self-contained design may inhibit sufficient observation of the software execution by an external monitor. The main aim of the research outlined in this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of using run-time verification as a monitoring approach for software executing in an embedded system. An experimental evaluation framework is described that supports the study of this approach. The embedded system comprises a Java Optimised Processor (JOP) soft processor, instantiated in the fabric of an FPGA (field programmable gate array). The experimental system employs the Java-MaC (Java Monitoring and Checking) run-time verification method, arranged to indirectly monitor the run-time behaviour of a software application executing on JOP. The experimental framework successfully allows run-time verification of a software application executing on the FPGA. A case study is presented that demonstrates that the monitoring approach is sufficient to observe a number of parameters used in an example ‘railroad crossing’ run-time verification scenario. A second case study aims to verify that a set of tasks scheduled under the rate-monotonic algorithm is scheduled at run time as predicted by static offline analysis. The results of the case studies provide detail on the potential and limitations of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The gathered data is used to support recommendations for monitoring {{embedded systems}}, presented at the conclusion of this thesis...|$|R

An important consequence is the overlapping of decision rights as well as property rights, which exposes PPP to a double alignment problem, organizational and institutional.
