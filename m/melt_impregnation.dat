40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{efficiency}} of different <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> methods for producing continuous glass fiber–polypropylene tapes has been evaluated. The selected methods were the common pin assisted method, a crosshead impregnation die including different vibration techniques and a slit die. The degree of <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> was studied qualitatively with optical microscopy and determined quantitatively by opacity measurements. Excellent results were obtained using the radial slit die, {{followed by the}} pin chamber impregnation method. The crosshead impregnation die gave poor impregnation. With the radial slit die {{it was possible to}} achieve high fiber volume fraction and it was easy to control the fiber–matrix content. The haul off speed ranged from 1 – 10 m/min.

40|$|The {{first step}} in the {{manufacturing}} of long and high fibre volume fraction of thermoplatic composite is the prepreg production with a <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> process. During this process a polymeric matrix is introduced into the fibre tow. In this research an extruder equipped with a specially designed cross-head die was used for producing long and high fibre volume fraction of thermoplastic prepregs and to study the continuous <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> of glass fibre roving with a polypropylene melt. A suitable relation determined from the cross-sectional area of the bundles and prepreg was selected as a proper indication of the impregnation quality. Our study shows that process and material parameters such as melt temperature and melt flow index have positive effect on the impregnation and those like line speed and melt pressure inside the cross-head die having a negative effect on fibre wetting.

40|$|We {{examined}} small-scale shear {{zones in}} drillcore samples of abyssal peridotites from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These shear zones {{are associated with}} veins consisting of chlorite + actinolite/tremolite assemblages, with accessory phases zircon and apatite, and they are interpreted as altered plagiogranite <b>melt</b> <b>impregnations,</b> which originate from hydrous partial melting of gabbroic intrusion in an oceanic detachment fault. Ti-in-zircon thermometry yields temperatures around 820 °C for the crystallization of the evolved melt. Reaction path modeling indicates that the alteration assemblage includes serpentine of the adjacent altered peridotites. Based on the model results, we propose that formation of chlorite occurred at higher temperatures than serpentinization, thus leading to strain localization around former plagiogranites during alteration. The detachment fault represents a major pathway for fluids through the oceanic crust, as evidenced by extremely low d 18 O of altered plagiogranite veins (+ 3. 0 - 4. 2 per mil) and adjacent serpentinites (+ 2. 6 - 3. 7 per mil). The uniform oxygen isotope data indicate that fluid flow in the detachment fault system affected veins and adjacent host serpentinites likewise...|$|R
40|$|A ~ 50 km {{stretch of}} the MAR south of its {{intersection}} with the Romanche transform lacks a basaltic crust and exposes mantle ultramafics. We tested {{the hypothesis that the}} absence of a basaltic crust reflects a temporary phase of a-magmatic extension by sampling the ocean floor along ridge-parallel profiles taken at increasing distances from the MAR axis, in lithosphere of increasing age. The basaltic crust is nearly absent in a ~ 50 Km wide strip of ocean floor on the southern side of the Romanche FZ extending from ridge axis for over 400 km along a sea floor spreading flow line. Assuming a spreading half rate of 1. 7 cm/yr, crust-free lithosphere formed and spread for roughly 30 m. y., excluding for this area a model of alternating cycles of igneous injection and a-magmatic extension at ridge axis. A ~ 30 m. y. steady-state formation and spreading of lithosphere that lacks a basaltic crust {{can be explained by the}} effect of a regional mantle thermal minimum combined with the thermal effect of a long-offset, slow-slip transform. The basaltic crust-free lithosphere created at the MAR close to the Romanche FZ consists of "normal" mid ocean ridge peridotites (N-MORP) that, however, have undergone an unusually low (< 5 %) degree of melting, mixed with "metasomatic" peridotites (M-MORP) that have reacted with a small fraction of basaltic melt. This lithosphere contains < 10 % of scattered gabbroic pockets. These <b>melt</b> <b>impregnations</b> and gabbroic pockets represent melt produced by small degree of melting, frozen within the top ~ 20 Km of the relatively cold subaxial lithosphere. This unusual lithosphere, unable to expel the melt fraction, ("constipated lithosphere") should be common in "cold spots" along mid ocean ridges...|$|R
40|$|Fe–Ni–Cu sulfide {{mineralogy}} {{has been}} investigated along with bulk-rock and in-situ PGE analyses by ICP MS and LA-ICP-MS in eight lherzolites from the Internal (IL) and External Liguride (EL) ophiolites (Italy). The two EL lherzolites are fertile (2 – 4 % partial melting) and slightly serpentinized while the six IL cpx-poor lherzolites have experienced 5 – 10 % of partial <b>melting,</b> <b>impregnation</b> by instantaneous <b>melt</b> fractions [Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 61 (1997) 4557] and have been highly serpentinized. The EL lherzolites show broadly chondritic PGE relative abundances with a slight to pronounced enhancement of the light PGE (Ru, Rh and Pd) relative to the heavy PGE (Os, Ir and Pt) (RuN/IrN= 1. 13; RhN/IrN= 1. 08 – 1. 10; PdN/IrN= 1. 24 – 1. 62; N=CI-chondrite normalized). Their magmatic sulfide modal abundances and S contents, similar to the orogenic peridotites values, are consistent with their very low degree of partial melting. The occurrence of Cu–Rh–Pd-rich pentlandite, however, demonstrates that, even for low degree of partial melting, a Cu–Ni-rich sulfide liquid can segregate, leaving the residual monosulfide solid solution (Mss) (now transformed into Cu-poor pentlandite) depleted in Rh and Pd (RhN/IrN and PdN/IrN< 1). The IL cpx-poor lherzolites display a broadly flat PGE patterns from Os to Pt with a slight enhancement of Ru and Rh (RuN/IrN= 1. 05 – 1. 38; RhN/IrN= 1. 01 – 1. 31). PdN/IrN ratios range from chondritic to superchondritic (1. 02 – 2. 99) and cannot be interpreted in terms of partial melting models. Rh–Pd–Cu–Ni-rich pentlandite grains are associated with large corroded cpx crystals ascribed to exotic melt percolation by Rampone et al. [Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 61 (1997) 4557]. It is concluded that precipitation of Cu–Ni–Rh–Pd-rich sulfides has significantly enhanced the Pd concentrations {{as well as the}} magmatic sulfide modal abundances. Such processes, previously documented in abyssal peridotites from slow-spreading mid-oceanic ridges, characterize residues from low to moderate melting degrees (5 – 10 %) of the oceanic mantle as a whole, either from mature ocean or from short-lived oceanic basins. 20 page(s...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe 1415 m deep IODP Hole U 1309 D (Mid-Atlantic Ridge, 30 degrees N) is {{the second}} deepest hole drilled into slow {{spreading}} oceanic lithosphere. The recovered section comprises essentially gabbroic rocks, with a large range of compositions. The most primitive end-members of the gabbroic sequence, herein referred to as olivine-rich troctolites (ol > similar to 70 %), have textures and geochemical compositions intermediate between that of mantle peridotites and primitive cumulates, indicative of <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> processes. We carried out a detailed microstructural study to further characterize the petrogenetic processes leading to their formation, as well as discuss their mode of emplacement and relationship with neighboring mantle lithosphere. In olivine-rich troctolites, olivines range from coarse-grained subhedral crystals, commonly containing well-developed subgrains, to medium-grained rounded crystals with fewer or no substructures. They are embedded in large, undeformed pyroxene and plagioclase poikiloblasts. Olivine substructures reveal dislocation creep {{that is consistent with}} activation of the main high-temperature slip systems, dominantly (010) [100]. Olivine crystallographic preferred orientation is very weak but generally shows a relatively stronger, uncommon [001] concentration. These unusual olivine fabrics are interpreted as resulting from <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> of a previously deformed olivine matrix: the solid olivine framework is disrupted by olivine corrosion along grain and subgrain boundaries, and the high-temperature plastic fabric is modified in a liquid-dominated regime. Based on mineral composition and fabrics and in comparison with what is observed in impregnated mantle rocks elsewhere, we posit that olivine represents relicts of mantle peridotites disaggregated by large melt influx, although the mantle origin of olivine is not unequivocally demonstrated yet. Whatever the initial lithology, impregnation by large volumes of melt has strongly modified the original composition and microstructure. If the mantle origin hypothesis is correct, the original olivine fabric could have been efficiently weakened by dunitization prior to disruption of the olivine framework by <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation.</b> Incorporation, {{at the base of the}} lithosphere, of small slivers of impregnated dunite into gabbroic sections, trapped between successive igneous units, may be a common mechanism of lower crustal accretion at slow spreading ridges.

40|$|The Sartohay {{block of}} the Dalabute {{ophiolite}} consists chiefly of mantle harzburgite and lherzolite with minor dunite. These rocks host voluminous chromite deposits with lenticular or vein-like shapes. The podiform chromitites are associated with, and cross-cut by, numerous troctolite dykes. Chromite in the chromitites has Al 2 O 3 (23 - 31 wt%). TiO 2 (0. 29 - 0. 44 wt%). and Cr 2 O 3 contents (< 45 wt%) with Cr#s [100 Cr/(Cr + Al) ] (< 60), typical of high-Al chromite deposits. The host peridotites in Sartohay have been texturally and geochemically modified by magmas {{from which the}} high-Al chromitites and mafic dykes formed. Dunites commonly envelop the podiform chromite bodies and show transitional contacts with the peridotites. Some of the peridotites and chromitites contain plagioclase that crystallized from impregnated melts. The dunite locally grades into troctolite with increasing plagioclase contents. As a result of <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation,</b> peridotites and dunites show variable Ca and Al contents and LREE enrichment. The parental magma of the chromitites was likely tholeiitic in composition, derived from partial melting of the asthenospheric mantle in a rising diapir. The interaction between this magma and pre-existing lithospheric mantle, composed of depleted lherzolite, would have formed a more silicic, tholeiitic magma from which high-Al chromitites crystallized. During this interaction, harzburgite and dunite were depleted in modal pyroxene and enriched in some incompatible elements (such as Al, Ca and LREE) due to <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation.</b> © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The Hess Deep, a rifted oval-shaped {{depression}} located {{east of the}} Galapagos Triple Junction {{at the tip of}} the Cocos-Nazca ridge (about 101 -degrees-W, 2 -degrees-N), was {{explored in}} 1988 during 21 submersible dives. A total of 11 dives were devoted to the exploration of the E-W trending Intrarift ridge (15 km in length, 3000 - 5400 m in depth) north of the Hess Deep depression. The Intrarift ridge represents, an outcrop of recent (1 m. y.) crustal and subcrustal material created at the axis of the East Pacific Rise (EPR), and emplaced during the lithospheric extention responsible for the westward propagation of the Cocos-Nazca rift (Francheteau et al., 1990). The lithospheric block has undergone cataclastic deformation and was dislocated by tectonic activity as attested to by the mixed and erratic distribution of rock types and by the occurrence of polygenic breccias and gabbroic mylonites. The samples are metamorphosed to varying degrees, but their protolith textures are generally well preserved. Their relic mineralogy indicates that they consist of harzburgites, dunites, gabbroic cumulates (gabbronorites and olivine gabbros), isotropic gabbros, dolerites, and basalts. Some samples of refractory harzburgites and most dunitic cumulates (with local accumulation of chromite) have been impregnated by wehrlitic and gabbroic primitive melts similar to those described from the mantle-crust transition zone of the Samail ophiolite complex (Oman). The mineral chemistry indicate that the ultramafics partly reequilibrated with the magmatic impregnations in the liquidus-solidus temperature range of 980 - 1100 -degrees-C. The dolerites and basalts have been derived from mid-ocean ridge basalt primary melts presenting a broad range of incompatible element composition which suggests intermittent cycles of magmatic processes involving a progressive melting of a composite source with discontinous extraction of liquids as proposed for the EPR volcanics near 13 -degrees-N (Hekinian et al., 1989). Most of the rocks underwent partial retrograde metamorphism and recorded several episodes of recrystallization from the upper greenschist facies (ultramafics and gabbros) to diagenetic alteration (volcanics). The cumulate gabbronorites, the isotropic gabbros, and some dolerites were partially albitized and amphibolitized during the penetration of seawater in the ocean crust prior to serpentinization. Several samples of unfoliated amphibolites are believed to be completely metamorphosed gabbroic rocks. The gabbroic cumulates and the plagioclase-rich <b>melt</b> <b>impregnations</b> were variably rodingitized (presence of various Ca-silicates such as epidote, prehnite, hydrogarnet, and zeolite) in relation to the serpentinization of the peridotites. One dive located on the scarps forming the northern wall of the Hess Deep to the east of the explored area, revealed the presence of in situ outcrops of isotropic gabbros, doleritic dikes, and extrusives and permitted to observe the contact between the sheeted dike complex and the high level isotropic gabbros...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{organic polymer}} {{chemistry}} {{has been successful}} in producing composition of matter with thermal oxidation stability and progressively higher glass transition temperatures. In part, this was done by increasing the steric-hindrance of moieties in the chain of a macromolecule. The resulting polymers are usually quite insoluble and produce molten polymers of very high viscosities. These types of polymers are not easily processed into graphite fiber prepregs by <b>melt</b> or solution <b>impregnation</b> methods. Hence, a technological need exists to produce new knowledge of how to produce polymer-fiber composites from this class of polymers. The concept of freeze drying amic-acid prepolymers with reactive thermoplastic was proposed as a research topic for the ASEE/NASA Summer Faculty Program of 1989 as a means of producing polymer-fiber composites. This process scheme has the thermodynamic attribute that the magnitude of phase separation due to differences in solubility of two organic constituents in solution will be greatly reduced by removing a solvent not by evaporation but by sublimation. Progress to date on evaluating this polymer processing concept is briefly outlined...|$|R
40|$|International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 357 {{successfully}} cored an east–west transect {{across the}} southern wall of Atlantis Massif {{on the western}} flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to study the links between serpentinization processes and microbial activity in the shallow subsurface of highly altered ultramafic and mafic sequences that have been uplifted to the seafloor along a major detachment fault zone. The primary goals of this expedition were to (1) examine the role of serpentinization in driving hydrothermal systems, sustaining microbial communities, and sequestering carbon; (2) characterize the tectonomagmatic processes that lead to lithospheric heterogeneities and detachment faulting; and (3) assess how abiotic and biotic processes change with variations in rock type and progressive exposure on the seafloor. To accomplish these objectives, we developed a coring and sampling strategy based around the use of seabed rock drills—the first time that such systems {{have been used in}} the scientific ocean drilling programs. This technology was chosen in hopes of achieving high recovery of the carbonate cap sequences and intact contact and deformation relationships. The expedition plans also included several engineering developments to assess geochemical parameters during drilling; sample bottom water before and after drilling; supply synthetic tracers during drilling for contamination assessment; gather downhole electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility logs for assessing fractures, fluid flow, and extent of serpentinization; and seal boreholes to provide opportunities for future experiments. Seventeen holes were drilled at nine sites across Atlantis Massif, with two sites on the eastern end of the southern wall (Sites M 0068 and M 0075), three sites in the central section of the southern wall north of the Lost City hydrothermal field (Sites M 0069, M 0072, and M 0076), two sites on the western end (Sites M 0071 and M 0073), and two sites north of the southern wall {{in the direction of the}} central dome of the massif and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U 1309 (Sites M 0070 and M 0074). Use of seabed rock drills enabled collection of more than 57 m of core, with borehole penetration ranging from 1. 3 to 16. 44 meters below seafloor and core recoveries as high as 75 % of total penetration. This high level of recovery of shallow mantle sequences is unprecedented in the history of ocean drilling. The cores recovered along the southern wall of Atlantis Massif have highly heterogeneous lithologies, types of alteration, and degrees of deformation. The ultramafic rocks are dominated by harzburgites with intervals of dunite and minor pyroxenite veins, as well as gabbroic rocks occurring as <b>melt</b> <b>impregnations</b> and veins, all of which provide information about early magmatic processes and the magmatic evolution in the southernmost portion of Atlantis Massif. Dolerite dikes and basaltic rocks represent the latest stage of magmatic activity. Overall, the ultramafic rocks recovered during Expedition 357 revealed a high degree of serpentinization, as well as metasomatic talc-amphibole-chlorite overprinting and local rodingitization. Metasomatism postdates an early phase of serpentinization but predates late-stage intrusion and alteration of dolerite dikes and the extrusion of basalt. The intensity of alteration is generally lower in the gabbroic and doleritic rocks. Chilled margins in dolerite intruded into talc-amphibole-chlorite schists are observed at the most eastern Site M 0075. Deformation in Expedition 357 cores is variable and dominated by brecciation and formation of localized shear zones; the degree of carbonate veining was lower than anticipated. All types of variably altered and deformed ultramafic and mafic rocks occur as components in sedimentary breccias and as fault scarp rubble. The sedimentary cap rocks include basaltic breccias with a carbonate sand matrix and/or fossiliferous carbonate. Fresh glass on basaltic components was observed in some of the breccias. The expedition also successfully applied new technologies, namely (1) extensively using an in situ sensor package and water sampling system on the seabed drills for evaluating real-time dissolved oxygen and methane, pH, oxidation-reduction potential, temperature, and conductivity during drilling; (2) deploying a borehole plug system for sealing seabed drill boreholes at four sites to allow access for future sampling; and (3) proving that tracers can be delivered into drilling fluids when using seabed drills. The rock drill sensor packages and water sampling enabled detection of elevated dissolved methane and hydrogen concentrations during and/or after drilling, with “hot spots” of hydrogen observed over Sites M 0068 –M 0072 and methane over Sites M 0070 –M 0072. Shipboard determination of contamination tracer delivery confirmed appropriate sample handling procedures for microbiological and geochemical analyses, which will aid all subsequent microbiological investigations that are part of the science party sampling plans, as well as verify this new tracer delivery technology for seabed drill rigs. Shipboard investigation of biomass density in select samples revealed relatively low and variable cell densities, and enrichment experiments set up shipboard reveal growth. Thus, we anticipate achieving many of the deep biosphere–related objectives of the expedition through continued scientific investigation in the coming years. Finally, although not an objective of the expedition, we were serendipitously able to generate a high-resolution (20 m per pixel) multibeam bathymetry map across the entire Atlantis Massif and the nearby fracture zone, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and eastern conjugate, taking advantage of weather and operational downtime. This will assist science party members in evaluating and interpreting tectonic and mass-wasting processes at Atlantis Massif...|$|R

40|$|The Godzilla Megamullion, {{located in}} the Parece Vela Backarc Basin of the Izu–Bonin–Mariana (IBM) system, is the largest known example of an Oceanic Core Complex (OCC). Peridotites {{recovered}} from the megamullion are divided petrographically into fertile (e. g. lherzolites), depleted (e. g. harzburgites), and plagioclase-bearing groups (Ohara et al., 2003 a). A total of 151 thin sections were studied from the Kairei KR 03 - 01, Hakuho Maru KH 07 - 02, and Yokosuka YK 09 - 05 cruises. Melt stagnation is studied via the incidence of plagioclase-bearing peridotites and the major element chemistry of Cr-spinels in the plag-bearing samples. A distinct trend in melt stagnation is evident {{along the length of}} the megamullion representing a secular evolution in the entrapment of melts rising through the lithosphere. The distal (furthest from the termination of spreading), depleted portion of the mullion represents a robust mantle section that was still producing abundant melt and can be compared to typical oceanic spreading with its relatively “normal” percentage of plagioclase peridotites and average spinel Cr# of 0. 35. The medial, fertile portion of the mullion represents a steep falloff in melt productivity represented by fertile spinel compositions (i. e. Cr# < 0. 25) and the presence of plagioclase-free lherzolites. The proximal (closest to termination of spreading), heavily plagioclase impregnated portion (with spinel Cr#s covering nearly the entire range of abyssal peridotite spinel compositions) of the mullion then represents a period of increasing stagnation of melt into a lithosphere that was undergoing progressive thickening. We infer that the processes of mantle evolution through <b>melt</b> stagnation and <b>impregnation,</b> as evidenced by the systematic variations in plag–peridotites along Godzilla Megamullion, represent a possibly common way in which the mantle reacts to OCC formation. In this case, Godzilla Megamullion may represent an extreme endmember in OCC formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to improve the dissolution rate of the poorly waters-soluble drug, fenofibrate by processing it with a high surface area carrier, mesoporous silica. The subsequent properties of the drug – silica composite were studied in terms of drug distribution within the silica matrix, solid state and release properties. Prior to commencing any experimental work, the properties of unprocessed mesoporous silica and fenofibrate were characterised (chapter 3), this allowed for comparison with the processed samples studied in later chapters. Fenofibrate was a highly stable, crystalline drug that did not adsorb moisture, even under long term accelerated storage conditions. It maintained its crystallinity even after SC-CO 2 processing. Its dissolution rate was limited and dependent {{on the characteristics of}} the particular in vitro media studied. Mesoporous silica had a large surface area and mesopore volume and readily picked up moisture when stored under long term accelerated storage conditions (75 % RH, 40 oC). It maintained its mesopore character after SC-CO 2 processing. A variety of methods were employed to process fenofibrate with mesoporous silica including physical mixing, <b>melt</b> method, solvent <b>impregnation</b> and novel methods such as liquid and supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) (chapter 4). It was found {{that it was important to}} break down the fenofibrate particulate structure to a molecular state to enable drug molecules enter into the silica mesopores. While all processing methods led to some increase in fenofibrate release properties; the impregnation, liquid and SC-CO 2 methods produced the most rapid release rates. SC-CO 2 processing was further studied with a view to optimising the processing parameters to achieve the highest drug-loading efficiency possible (chapter 5). In this thesis, it was that SC-CO 2 processing pressure had a bearing on drug-loading efficiency. Neither pressure, duration or depressurisation rate affected drug solid state or release properties. The amount of drug that could be loaded onto to the mesoporous silica successfully was also investigated at different ratios of drug mass to silica surface area under constant SC-CO 2 conditions; as the drug – silica ratio increased, the drug-loading efficiency decreased, while there was no effect on drug solid state or release properties. The influence of the number of drug-loading steps was investigated (chapter 6) with a view to increasing the drug-loading efficiency. This multiple step approach did not yield an increase in drug-loading efficiency compared to the single step approach. It was also an objective in this chapter to understand how much drug could be loaded into silica mesopores; a method based on the known volume of the mesopores and true density of drug was investigated. However, this approach led to serious repercussions in terms of the subsequent solid state nature of the drug and its release performance; there was significant drug crystallinity and reduced release extent. The impact of in vitro release media on fenofibrate release was also studied (chapter 6). Here it was seen that media containing HCl led to reduced drug release over time compared to equivalent media not containing HCl. The key findings of this thesis are discussed in chapter 7 and included: 1. Drug – silica processing method strongly influenced drug distribution within the silica matrix, drug solid state and release. 2. The silica surface area and mesopore volume also influenced how much drug could be loaded. It was shown that SC-CO 2 processing variables such as processing pressure (13. 79 – 41. 37 MPa), duration time (4 – 24 h) and depressurisation rate (rapid or controlled) did not influence the drug distribution within the SBA- 15 matrix, drug solid state form or release. Possible avenues of research to be considered going forward include the development and application of high resolution imaging techniques to visualise drug molecules within the silica mesopores. Also, the issues surrounding SBA- 15 usage in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment should be addressed...|$|R
40|$|The chalcophile elements, as {{associated}} with sulfides, are believed {{mainly from the}} study of ophiolites to be generally enriched in the upper mantle, but depleted by magmatic processes in the lower and upper ocean crust. However, studies of some orogenic lherzolites suggest a copper depletion of peridotites in relation to the primitive mantle, suggesting that a portion of the sulfides is melted during decompression and incorporated into the ascending magmas. The rarity of abyssal peridotites and the high degree of their alteration have not allowed these results to be verified in situ in the oceans. Here, we present the first complete study of chalcophile elements based on a suite of rocks from an oceanic core complex (OCC), the Kane Megamullion at 22 ° 30 ’N at the MidAtlantic Ridge. OCCs provide large exposures of mantle and lower crustal rocks on the seafloor on detachment fault footwalls at slow and ultraslow spreading ridges. The Kane Megamullion {{is one of the best}} sampled OCCs in the world, with 1342 rocks from 28 dredge sites and 14 dives. We have made XRF, TDMS and INAA analyses of 129 representative peridotites, gabbroic rocks, diabases and basalts. Our results suggest a depletion of some peridotites in relation to the primitive mantle (28 ppm Cu). Dunites, troctolites and olivine gabbros are relatively enriched in chalcophile elements. The amount of sulfides decreases gradually with progressive differentiation, reaching a minimum in gabbronorites and diabases. The highest bulk abundance of chalcophile elements in our sample suite was observed in dunites (up to ~ 300 ppm Cu in several samples) and a contact zone between residual peridotite and a mafic vein (294 ppm Cu). Plagioclasebearing harzburgites, generally formed by latestage <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> in the mantle, are typically more enriched in Cu than unimpregnated residual peridotites.

The fiber lengths decreased with fiber concentration from 1. 6 mm for a 2 vol% to 0. 6 mm for a 25 vol% system. The tensile and impact properties increased considerably with fiber concentration.

Thermoplastic pultrusion compounding is one of the techniques used to manufacture this injection mouldable material.

The LCP/CF composites have good property retention until 200 F (67 % of room temperature value). Above 200 F, mechanical properties decrease significantly. Experimental results indicate that the poor compression and shear strength {{may be due to the}} poor interfacial adhesion between the matrix and carbon fiber as adequate toughness of the LCP matrix.

40|$|The Erro-Tobbio peridotites (Voltri Massif, Ligurian Alps) {{represent}} subcontinental lithospheric mantle tectonically exhumed during Permo-Mesozoic {{extension of}} the Europe-Adria lithosphere. Previous {{studies have shown that}} exhumation started during Permian times, and occurred along kilometer-scale lithospheric shear zones which enhanced progressive deformation and recrystallization from spinel- to plagioclase-facies conditions. Ongoing field and petrologic investigations have revealed that the peridotites experienced, during uplift, a composite history of diffuse melt migration and multiple episodes of ultramafic-mafic intrusions. In this paper we present the results of field, structural and petrologic-geochemical investigations into a sector of the Erro-Tobbio peridofite unit that preserves well this multiple intrusion history. <b>Melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> in the peridotites is evidenced by significant plagioclase enrichment and crystallization of unstrained orthopyroxene replacing kinked mantle olivine and clinopyroxene; impregnating melts were thus opx-saturated. Melt-rock interaction caused chemical changes in mantle minerals (e. g. Al decrease and REE increase in cpx; Ti and Cr# enrichment in spinel). Nevertheless, clinopyroxerres still exhibit LREE depletion (Ce-N/Sm-N= 0. 006 - 0. 011), indicating a depleted signature for the percolating melts. <b>Melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> was thus related to diffuse porous flow migration of depleted MORB-type melt fractions that modified their compositions towards opx saturation by mantle-melt interaction during ascent. The impregnated peridotites are intruded by a hectometer-scale stratified cumulate body, mostly consisting of troctolites and plagioclase wehrlites, showing gradational, interfingered contacts with the host mantle rocks. Subsequent intrusion events are revealed by the occurrence of olivine gabbros as decameter-wide lenses, variably thick (centimeter- to meter-scale) dykes and thin dykelets, which crosscut both the peridotite foliation and the magmatic layering in the cumulates. Overall, major and trace element compositions of minerals in the intrusives indicate that they represent variably differentiated cumulus products crystallized from rather primitive N-MORB-type aggregated melts. Slightly more evolved compositions are shown by olivine gabbros, relative to the troctolites and plagioclase wehrlites of the cumulate body. Mineral chemistry features (e. g. the Fo-An correlation and high Na, Ti, Mg# in cpx) indicate that the studied intrusive rocks crystallized at moderate pressure conditions (3 - 5 kbar, i. e. 9 - 15 km depth). Our study thus points to a progressive transition from porous flow melt migration to emplacement of magmas in fractures, presumably related to progressive change of lithospheric mantle rheology during extension-related uplift and cooling...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{thermoplastic}} composites {{based on}} poly(lactic) acid and phosphate glass fibres over metallic alloys for clinical restorative treatment is highly beneficial {{due to their}} biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, difficulties in achieving a thorough <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> at high fibre contents while limiting polymer degradation {{is one of the}} main issues encountered during their manufacture. This paper reports for the first time on the effects of pressure cycling on the mechanical properties of compression moulded polylactic acid-phosphate glass fibre composites. The strength of the composites consolidated under pressure cycling were at least 30 % higher than those in which conventional static pressure was used. The marked disparity was attributed to the influence of pressure cycling on the fibre preform permeability, the melt viscosity and the capillary pressure, leading to improved fibre wet-out with respect to static pressure. Implementation of a cyclic pressure appeared to promote the occurrence of transcrystallinity in the polymer matrix as suggested by DSC traces. The fibre content influenced PLA thermal degradation since the matrix molecular weight decreased as the fibre content increased on account of the moisture adsorbed by the glass surface. However, this extent of degradation did not impair the matrix mechanical performance in the composites...|$|E

So the combustor is required lightweight material and super-heat-resistant material. SiC-based ceramics is used as heat-resistant material in the aerospace field. This material maintain the mechanical properties at high temperatures and has a high oxidation resistance. However, heat resistance temperature of this material is about 1600 ℃.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of the {{documented}} research project the focus was on investigating the modification of carbon fibers by electropolymerization and impregnation of carbon fiber rovings by means of aqueous polymer powder dispersions. Bringing to bear the outstanding mechanical characteristics of carbon fibers in composite materials requires a purposeful modification of the fiber surfaces adapted to the respective matrix material. Based on the natural conductivity of carbon fibers the method of electropolymerization offers itself. Among the variety of possibilities of electrochemical deposition of polymers, oxidative anodic polymerization of monomers, which leads to intrinsically conductive polymers, was selected. The formation of these polymers occurs in a step-by-step reaction analog to polycondensation. In the process, at least two electrochemical oxidation equivalents are required for each step of growth, with the polymers being deposited as conducting polymeric radical cations containing anions dispersed from the conducting salt used in the electrolytic bath. The investigation of deposited polymers was made by means of gravimetry, electrochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) was used as matrix material.

40|$|The close {{association}} of harzburgite, dunite, troctolites, olivine gabbro, and gabbro {{in the core}} recovered from the mantle exposed at Hess Deep suggests that these rocks belong to a suite of tectonized residual mantle peridotites through which a mafic melt was transported. Textures of this suite of rocks are interpreted to result from complex interactions between various igneous processes, including partial melting, multiple episodes of melt injection, wall-rock interactions and olivine crystalliza-tion. The undeformed nature of intergranular Plagioclase, pyroxene and spinel in dunite containing deformed olivine grains suggests that crystallization of an interstitial mafic melt post-dates the high temperature deformation of olivine. Dislocation densities in olivine grains of troctolites are {{higher than those of}} olivine within harzburgites and dunites; thus the introduction of dislocations in the troctolites appears to correspond to a localized late-stage higher stress deformation that did not affect the harzburgites. Dislocation geometries and identification of the [100] Burgers vector for dislocations in olivine grains from the troctolites suggest that the introduction of dislocations occurred at relatively high temperatures; dislocations with the [100] Burgers vector are not activated under experimental conditions in olivine at temperatures below 800 °C. We suggest that the introduction of mafic melt within the dunites was responsible for the local high-stress event recorded by olivine grains, in con-trast to the low stress deformation that may be expected for slow melt migration by percolation through porous dunites.

40|$|Serpentinized spinel peridotites of the Newfoundland margin drilled during ODP Leg 210 at Site 1277 have preserved, relic mineral {{compositions}} {{similar to}} the most depleted abyssal peridotites worldwide and {{different from those of}} the conjugate Iberian margin. The samples are derived from mass flows containing clasts of peridotite and gabbro and from in-situ basement, and are mostly mylonitic cpx-poor spinel harzburgites with Cr-rich spinels (Cr# 0. 35 - 0. 66). Melting of the Newfoundland mantle occurred in the spinel peridotite field and probably exceeded the cpx-out phase boundary for some samples. Using proposed spinel peridotite melting models and experimentally derived phase diagrams, the Newfoundland harzburgites can be modeled as a residue after extraction of 14 to 20 - 25 % melting. Basalts that are interleaved with mass flow deposits on top of the peridotite basement resemble normal to transitional mid-ocean ridge basalt. This, together with the unusually high Cr# of some spinel harzburgites suggest that the formation of basalts and partial melting of the underlying peridotite are not cogenetic. Among mantle samples some of the Newfoundland harzburgites approach mineral compositions of the Bay of island ophiolite and ophiolites from Japan that represent peridotites formed in an arc-setting. Thus, the peridotites drilled at Site 1277 may represent inherited (Caledonian or older) subarc mantle that was exhumed close to the ocean floor during the rifting evolution of the Atlantic. Compared to the spinel harzburgites from Newfoundland, the peridotites from the conjugate Iberian margin are, on average, less depleted and provide evidence for local equilibration in the plagioclase stability field. This can either be explained by an inherited, primary, Ca-richer composition of the Iberia peridotite, or, alternatively, by local <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> and stagnation during continental rifting, and thus refertilizing previously depleted (arc-related) peridotite...|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} to quantify the Li, Be and B content of oceanic peridotites, in order to evaluate {{their contributions to the}} light element input in subduction zones (compared to oceanic crust). In previous studies, the input related to oceanic mantle was usually neglected, because no strong data are available for the light element contents (minerals, whole rock samples). The objective of this thesis is to provide a dataset of Li, Be and B contents of minerals and whole rock samples from fresh and serpentinized oceanic mantle, and to determine processes which can potentially modify the light element signature of the oceanic mantle. The Li, Be and B content of the oceanic mantle can be modified during processes acting close to mid-ocean ridges, like mafic melt percolation/impregnation and serpentinization. The Li, Be and B content can also be changed during emplacement of oceanic mantle into the continental crust. In order to study these processes, oceanic mantle from various tectonic settings was studied: (i) Pindos ophiolite (Greece) for melt-related processes, (ii) Pindos and Vourinos ophiolites (Greece), Mid-Atlantic ridge (MAR) ODP Leg 209 for serpentinization, (iii) Geisspfad ultramafic body (Alps) for the effect of the emplacement into the continental crust. The study of the Dramala harzburgites (Pindos), recording high degree of partial melting prior to melt percolation, shows that there is a Li enrichment of the depleted harzburgite during the crystallization of clinopyroxene cumulate (Li in Cpx ≤ 3. 7 µg/g), related to percolation of N-MORB melt. Subsequent impregnation by ultra-depleted melt did not change the Li, Be and B content of the harzburgites. Light element contents of the fresh Dramala harzburgite after melt-related processes are low (Li: 0. 9 - 1. 0 µg/g, Be: < 0. 003 µg/g, B: < 0. 03 µg/g). These low contents are certainly due to the high degree partial melting, while <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> and/or percolation does not strongly modify the light element content of whole rock samples. During serpentinization, there is a B enrichment in whole rock samples (no Li or Be enrichment), while Li, Be and B contents of the primary mantle phases stay constant. The major B carrier phase is serpentine (≤ 28 µg/g). The quantity of B incorporated into serpentinized harzburgite probably depends on the nature of serpentinization (temperature, pH, water/rock ratio). B contents in serpentine/serpentinites from Dramala serpentinized harzburgites are low compared to serpentinites from the MAR. Samples from Dramala show low whole rock B contents in highly serpentinized harzburgites (up to 1. 1 µg/g) and heterogeneous B content in serpentine (0. 1 - 28 µg/g). It probably reflects serpentinization occurring at high temperature and low water/rock ratio. In contrast, serpentinization in the MAR samples led to high B content in serpentine (≤ 200 µg/g) and serpentinites (10 - 65 µg/g), probably related to low temperatures and high water/rock ratio. The Geisspfad serpentinites showed that Li, Be and B contents of oceanic serpentinites are modified during emplacement into the continental crust by fluids related to retrograde metamorphism (evident from Li, Be and B contents in minerals/whole rock samples). These fluids can penetrate ultramafic bodies or travel along the contact between the ultramafics and the surrounding crustal rocks. It shows that only large ultramafic bodies can potentially maintain their prograde light element systematics in the core. In conclusion, light element content of the fresh oceanic mantle is low, except for Li (can be enriched during N-MORB <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation).</b> The oceanic mantle is variably enriched in B during serpentinization, depending on temperature, pH and water/rock ratio. Due to its big volume compared to the oceanic crust, the oceanic mantle could strongly contribute to the Li and B input into subduction zones...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Jurassic Mirdita {{ophiolite}} crops out in {{the western}} branch of the Hellenide-Dinaride ophiolite belt in the Balkan Peninsula; it represents a remnant of the Tethyan oceanic lithosphere developed between the Apulian and Pelagonian microcontinents. Emplaced during the Cretaceous on the western margin of Pelagonia, the Mirdita ophiolite was involved in southwestward thrusting of the Hellenide-Dinaride tectonic units during the Eocene alpine tectonics. It was little affected, however, by these alpine events as marked by nearly horizontal Cretaceous limestone deposits overlying the ophiolite. A continuous section of Middle Jurassic oceanic crust, including thin gabbros, a N-S-trending sheeted dike complex, and extrusive rocks, is exposed in {{the central part of}} the ophiolite and thickens eastward within a regional, N-S-trending synform. Peridotite massifs exposed along the western and eastern edges of this synform show major structural and petrological differences. The eastern ultramafic domain has a harzburgitic mantle exhibiting a high-temperature asthenospheric foliation dipping steeply to moderately to the west. Major chromite deposits are restricted to these eastern ultramafic massifs. The western ultramafic domain has a zoned mantle, with asthenospheric harzburgite exposed at its western margin, progressively replaced eastward by plagioclase-peridotites that were highly strained at low temperatures, and that are bounded by amphibole-peridotites along with crustal rocks. The occurrence of plagioclase is ascribed to <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> processes that occurred immediately before or during intense lithospheric deformation. The gabbros in the eastern massifs are thicker (1 - 2 km and layered, whereas they are highly thin and discontinuous in the western massifs. Mantle peridotites of the western massifs locally are in direct contact with the overlying diabase and volcanic rocks along ductile shear zones. Development of epidote-amphibolite facies metamorphism in upper-crustal rocks was produced by hydrothermal alteration in the oceanic realm, and was intense and widespread in the western domain. The Mirdita ophiolite likely originated in a short-lived, narrow ocean basin, which was closed during the Middle Jurassic by eastward overthrusting of the western domain, and westward subduction of the eastern domain. This constrictional phase was followed by dextral oblique convergence between the Pelagonian and Apulian microcontinents. This model implies a parautochtonous origin of the Mirdita ophiolite between these two microcontinents...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe New Caledonia {{ophiolite}} (Peridotite Nappe) {{is dominated}} by mantle lithologies, composed of forearc-related refractory harzburgites and minor lherzolites in both the spinel and plagioclase facies. In this study, a comprehensive geochemical data set (major, trace elements and Sr–Nd isotopes) is used to constrain the mantle evolution of the lherzolites and their relationships with the basalts from the Poya Terrane, which tectonically underlies the mantle rocks. The majority of the lherzolites are low-strain porphyroclastic tectonites. They likely record an asthenospheric origin followed by re-equilibration at lithospheric conditions, as supported by geothermometric estimates (T = 1100 – 940 °C and 920 – 890 °C for porphyroclastic and neoblastic spinel-facies assemblages, respectively). Olivine composition (Fo = 88. 5 – 90. 0 mol%), spinel Cr# ([molar 100 • Cr/(Cr + Al) ] = 13 – 17) and relatively high amounts (7 – 8 vol%) of Al 2 O 3 - and Na 2 O-rich clinopyroxene (up to 0. 5 and 6. 5 wt. %, respectively) indicate a moderately depleted geochemical signature for the spinel lherzolites. Bulk rock and clinopyroxene rare earth elements (REE) patterns display a typical abyssal-type signature, i. e. steeply plunging LREE accompanied by nearly flat HREE to MREE. Clinopyroxene REE compositions of the spinel lherzolites may be reproduced by small amounts of fractional melting of a garnet lherzolite precursor (~ 4 %), followed by 4 %– 5 % melting in the spinel peridotite field. The plagioclase lherzolites show <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> microstructures, Cr- and Ti-rich spinels and incompatible trace element enrichments (REE, Ti, Y, and Zr) in bulk rocks and clinopyroxenes. Impregnation modelling for these elements suggests that the plagioclase lherzolites originated from residual spinel lherzolites by entrapment of highly depleted (non-aggregated) MORB melt fractions in the shallow oceanic lithosphere. Nd isotope compositions of the investigated peridotites are consistent with derivation from an asthenospheric mantle source that experienced a recent MORB-producing depletion event. This evolution was most likely accomplished in a spreading ridge. However, geochemical trace element modelling and Nd isotopes do not support a genetic mantle–crust link between the lherzolites and enriched-MOR-type basalts from the Poya Terrane...|$|E
40|$|Mantle domains from present-day {{and ancient}} ocean-continent {{transition}} zones display signs of melt/rock reaction, but {{the relationships of}} the deformation processes during magma-starved periods of (ultra-) slow spreading are poorly understood. The transition from melt-poor to -rich regions {{is likely to be}} an important rheological boundary. The mylonitic mantle shear zones are commonly found in peridotite massifs and in the oceanic lithosphere and the grain size reduction is considered as an important process, but the role of melt-enhanced reactions is less well known. This thesis is the result of field, petrologic and geochemical studies on a high temperature mantle shear zone in the Lanzo peridotite massif from the Western Alps (Northern Italy), and its interaction with melt migration are presented. The mantle shear zone between the northern and the central bodies of the Lanzo massif displays five rock types with different deformation fabrics: coarse grained secondary granular (CGSG), fine grained secondary granular (FGSG), proto-mylonite, mylonite, hydrous-mylonite and ultra-mylonite. The spatial distribution of deformation is asymmetric with respect to the mylonite, increases from SW to NE, and the northern body is composed of CGSG rocks. Discordant mafic dikes are asymmetrically distributed and concentrated in the southern part, which is interpreted as the footwall of the large mantle shear zone. The high Al pyroxene porphyroclastic cores, indicate high temperatures (1100 - 1030 °C). The low Al neoblasts, display substantially lower final equilibration temperatures at ~ 860 °C. Spinel Cr# (molar Cr/Cr+Al) and TiO 2 concentrations are extremely variable and cover the entire range from spinel to plagioclase peridotite. The variability does not correlate with microstructures in a simple way. However, the CGSG spinel compositions from the central body are more variable than spinel from mylonite, hydrous-mylonite and spinel compositions from the northern body. The spinel compositions indicate local disequilibrium, argue for a rapid exhumation of the central relative to the northern peridotite body. <b>Melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> textures such as dissolution of clinopyroxene and cotectic crystallization of orthopyroxene and plagioclase, and replacement of olivine by orthopyroxene are common in the massif. <b>Melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> textures largely disappear in the mylonite, indicating that deformation along the mylonite zone outlasted melt-rock reactions. Melt-rock reaction may cause grain size reduction, which in turn led to localization of deformation. The actively deforming peridotite mylonite acted as a permeability barrier for migrating liquid, and thus inhibiting the propagation of gabbroic dikes. This is supported by the observation that gabbros are asymmetrically distributed with respect to the shear zone and concentrate in the footwall of the high-temperature peridotite mylonite zone. The whole rock major and trace element data of variably deformed peridotite display a large compositional variation from "super-fertile" (e. g. higher than primitive upper mantle [PUM]) to refractory peridotite in the CGSG and, a homogeneous fertile composition in the deformed rocks, which can be explained by grain size reduction. The incompatible elements show an enrichment in the order of 10 - 20 % in the deformed rocks (proto-mylonite, mylonite and hydrous-mylonite) compared to the CGSG from the northern body. This supports the hypothesis that fine-grained rocks acted as a permeability barrier. The (Ce/Yb) N ratio display little variation and reinforces the hypothesis that the geochemical signature is not defined by fractionation processes. Simple models indicate that the plagioclase peridotite composition is more consistent with the refertilization processes. It can qualitatively be estimated, that about 5 to 10 % of MORB-type liquid must be added to explain the variability of the Lanzo plagioclase peridotites. The nrichment of peridotites in the footwall of a major mantle shear zone indicates that melt accumulation must have been important: consistent with the permeability hypothesis. Gabbroic rocks from the Lanzo peridotite massif form a cumulate sequence with about 3 orders of magnitude enrichment of incompatible elements. Fe-Ti gabbros dated from the central and {{the southern part of the}} massif provided middle Jurassic ages of 161 ± 2, 158 ± 2 and 163 ± 1 Ma, which argues for magmatic activity over a few millions of years. Zircon crystals are characterized by high but variable Th/U ratios, REE patterns enriched in HREE, pronounced positive Ce and negative Eu-anomalies consistent with crystallization after substantial plagioclase fractionation. The zircon trace element composition coupled with whole rock chemistry indicate that a number of gabbros crystallized in-situ, and zircon precipitated from trapped, intercumulus liquid, while other gabbros represent residual liquids that were extracted from a cumulus pile and crystallized along syn-magmatic shear zones. We propose a model, in which the emplacement mechanism of gabbroic rocks in ocean continent transition zones evolves from "early" in-situ crystallization to "late" stratified crystallization with efficient extraction of residual liquid along syn-magmatic shear zones. Such an evolution of the igneous crystallization is probably related to the thermal evolution of the underlying mantle lithosphere...|$|E

40|$|Results of a {{field and}} {{microstructural}} study between the northern and the central bodies of the Lanzo plagioclase peridotite massif (NW Italy) indicate that the spatial distribution of deformation is asymmetric across kilometre-scale mantle shear zones. The southwestern part of the shear zone (footwall) shows a gradually increasing degree of deformation from porphyroclastic peridotites to mylonite, whereas the northeastern part (hanging wall) quickly grades into weakly deformed peridotites. Discordant gabbroic and basaltic dykes are asymmetrically distributed and far more abundant in the footwall of the shear zone. The porphyroclastic peridotite displays porphyroclastic zones and domains of igneous crystallization whereas mylonites are characterized by elongated porphyroclasts, embedded between fine-grained, polycrystalline bands of olivine, plagioclase, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, spinel, rare titanian pargasite, and domains of recrystallized olivine. Two types of <b>melt</b> <b>impregnation</b> textures have been found: (1) clinopyroxene porphyroclasts incongruently reacted with migrating melt to form orthopyroxene + plagioclase; (2) olivine porphyroclasts are partially replaced by interstitial orthopyroxene. The melt-rock reaction textures tend to disappear in the mylonites, indicating that deformation in the mylonite continued under subsolidus conditions. The pyroxene chemistry is correlated with grain size. High-Al pyroxene cores indicate high temperatures (1100 - 1030 °C), whereas low-Al neoblasts display lower final equilibration temperatures (∼ 860 °C). The spinel Cr-number [molar Cr/(Cr + Al) ] and TiO 2 concentrations show extreme variability covering almost the entire range known from abyssal peridotites. The spinel compositions of porphyroclastic peridotites from the central body are more variable than spinel from mylonite, mylonite with ultra-mylonite bands, and porphyroclastic rocks of the northern body. The spinel compositions probably indicate disequilibrium and would favour rapid cooling, and a faster exhumation of the central peridotite body, relative to the northern one. Our results indicate that melt migration and high-temperature deformation are juxtaposed both in time and space. Melt-rock reaction may have caused grain-size reduction, which in turn led to localization of deformation. It is likely that melt-lubricated, actively deforming peridotites acted as melt focusing zones, with permeabilities higher than the surrounding, less deformed peridotites. Later, under subsolidus conditions, pinning in polycrystalline bands in the mylonites inhibited substantial grain growth and led to permanent weak zones in the upper mantle peridotite, with a permeability that is lower than in the weakly deformed peridotites. Such an inversion in permeability might explain why actively deforming, fine-grained peridotite mylonite acted as a permeability barrier and why ascending mafic melts might terminate and crystallize as gabbros along actively deforming shear zones. Melt-lubricated mantle shear zones provide a mechanism for explaining the discontinuous distribution of gabbros in ocean-continent transition zones, oceanic core complexes and ultraslow-spreading ridge...|$|E
