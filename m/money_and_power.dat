5|$|Evans {{sought to}} promote a form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his white supremacist ideology, he fiercely condemned Catholicism, unionism, and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an anti-Semite. Historians credit Evans with refocusing the Klan on political activities and recruiting outside the Southern United States; the Klan grew most in the Midwest and industrial cities. However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were transitory. Some commentators argue that Evans was more focused on <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> than any particular ideology.|$|E

25|$|The Robbers (Die Räuber): The {{language}} of The Robbers is highly emotional, and {{the depiction of}} physical violence in the play marks it as a quintessential work of Germany's Romantic Sturm und Drang movement. The Robbers is considered by critics like Peter Brooks {{to be the first}} European melodrama. The play pits two brothers against each other in alternating scenes, as one quests for <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>power,</b> while the other attempts to create revolutionary anarchy in the Bohemian Forest. The play strongly criticises the hypocrisies of class and religion, and the economic inequities of German society; it also conducts a complicated inquiry into the nature of evil. Schiller was inspired by the play Julius of Tarent by Johann Anton Leisewitz.|$|E
25|$|The {{cyclotron}} was {{an improvement}} over the linear accelerators (linacs) that were available when it was invented, being more cost- and space-effective due to the iterated interaction of the particles with the accelerating field. In the 1920s, {{it was not possible}} to generate the high power, high-frequency radio waves which are used in modern linacs (generated by klystrons). As such, impractically long linac structures were required for higher-energy particles. The compactness of the cyclotron reduces other costs as well, such as foundations, radiation shielding, and the enclosing building. Cyclotrons have a single electrical driver, which saves both <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>power.</b> Furthermore, cyclotrons are able to produce a continuous stream of particles at the target, so the average power passed from a particle beam into a target is relatively high.|$|E

500|$|... "Decisions" [...] {{is marked}} a musical {{departure}} from Cyrus' earlier catalog {{and following the}} increasingly popular trend towards dance music. Lyrically, Borgore stated that [...] "the very literal meaning of the song is how much girls love eating cake but the subliminal message is how people are attracted to <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>power,</b> {{and in order to}} succeed in life you need to work hard and attract those people that are there for the right reasons".

Tucker and Paterson already knew Webber from several earlier projects; the director discovered the project by accident after visiting their office, where he noticed a poster of Vermeer's work and began discussing it. Webber read the script and described it as being [...] "... about creativity and the link between art and <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> and sex in some strange unholy mixture." [...] Characterising it as a [...] "coming of age" [...] story with a [...] "fascinating dark undertow," [...] Webber deliberately did not read the book prior to filming, {{as he was concerned}} about being influenced by it, opting instead to rely on the script and the period.|$|E

500|$|The film [...] {{addresses}} the prominent place that bureaucracy, and verbal negotiation and struggle, occupy {{in everyday life}} in China. Many scenes pit Wei against authority figures such as the village mayor, the announcer in the train station, and the TV station receptionist who also acts as a [...] "gatekeeper". Aside from Wei, many characters in the film show a [...] "blind faith" [...] in authority figures. While she lacks <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>power,</b> Wei overcomes her obstacles through sheer obstinacy and ignorant persistence, suggesting that speech and perseverance can overcome barriers. Wei becomes an example of [...] "heroic obstinacy" [...] and a model of using determination to face [...] "overwhelming odds". For this reason, the film has been frequently compared to Zhang's 1993 The Story of Qiu Ju, whose heroine is also a determined, stubborn woman; likewise, Qiu Ju is also filmed in a neo-realistic style, set partially in contemporary rural China and partially in the city, and employs mostly amateur actors.|$|E
500|$|Tom Young from BBC Music {{said that}} he did not see the actual {{performances}} on the tour and felt that [...] "some of the magnitude of the performance is lost and the track/scene changes appear needlessly long-winded. [...] As far as live albums go, this is a job well done." [...] Stephen M. Deusner from Pitchfork gave a negative review for the album, stating [...] "Madonna herself is mostly to blame. On stage, she draws from a deep well of amazing pop songs and has the <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> to reinvent this sort of traveling circus. So why not try to break down the wall between performance and audience and hold a gigantic rave? [...] Åkerlund gives you everything you don't want from a concert film: incessant quick cuts that you give you no sense of space or stage, overdubbed music and vocals that give you no sense of performance, and only a few shots of the audience to gauge their excitement." [...] Mini Anthikad-Chhibber The Hindu commented that [...] "Madonna pulls out all stops in this effort turn the world into a dance floor and one just has to doff one's hat to her energy."

500|$|For her, {{social justice}} is the {{essential}} element needed to banish fear and bring peace. Justice means freedom from oppression, but it also implies equality for all. [...] "In God's eyes," [...] she writes, [...] "all creatures have value and are subjects of equal care and love; similarly, in a society of justice and peace, all people matter equally." [...] Franklin suggests that in consumer-oriented societies, war and violence are the inevitable result of an acquisitive lifestyle that rejects caring and social justice. She quotes historian Lewis Mumford's observation that during the rise of capitalism, the sins of greed, gluttony, avarice, envy and luxury became cardinal virtues. Mumford goes on {{to argue that the}} [...] "moral change that took place under capitalism {{can be summed up in}} the fact that human purposes, human needs, and human limits no longer exercised a directing and restraining influence upon industry: people worked, not to maintain life, but to increase <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> and to minister to the ego that found satisfaction in vast accumulations of money and power." [...] Franklin extends Mumford's argument by pointing to new global realities such as militarized economies dependent on weapons production and national borders increasingly closed to refugees. [...] "Any modern theology of peace," [...] she writes, [...] "must, I think, take into account the worldwide drift towards 'techno-fascism,' the anti-people, anti-justice form of global management and power sharing that is developing around the world." ...|$|E

500|$|People {{are always}} {{using the word}} Illuminati but they're always {{referencing}} it in an incorrect way. People often accuse me of {{being a member of}} the Illuminati and I think in today's pop culture the Illuminati is perceived as a group of powerful, successful people who are working behind the scenes to control the universe. Not people with consciousness, not people who are enlightened. So people were accusing me of {{being a member of the}} Illuminati, and I kept going, wait—so first I had to figure out what that meant...I know who the real Illuminati are, and I know where that word comes from. The real Illuminati were a group of scientists, artists, philosophers, writers, who came about in what is referred to as the Age of Enlightenment, after the Dark Ages, when there was no writing and no art and no creativity and no spirituality, and life was really at a standstill. And right after that, everything flourished. So we had people like Shakespeare and Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Isaac Newton, and all these great minds and great thinkers, and they were called Illuminati...It had nothing to do with <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>power.</b> Of course they were powerful, because they influenced people. But their goal was to inspire and enlighten. So when people refer to me as a member of the Illuminati, I always want to say thank you. Thank you for putting me in that category.|$|E
500|$|After taking office, Lois {{attempts}} {{to propose a}} tax raise, though when this fails, begins to use fear tactics to raise funds {{to clean up the}} lake. Her efforts are successful and life returns to the clean lake. She even has leftover cash afterwards, so she embezzles $600 to purchase a purse, much to Brian's disappointment. Peter has also succumbed to the perks of being the mayor's husband: he has rerouted the town's electrical system and caused rolling blackouts to bring late comedian Jim Varney back from the dead (he does nothing but talk, playing his character Ernest, [...] and repeatedly refer to [...] "Vern".) He then remembers he actually wanted John Belushi and takes Varney outside to shoot him, only for Varney to end up taking the gun from him and Peter running away from him warning Brian. [...] Later, Lois is tempted to buy a $4,300 fur coat, and Bob Grossbeard, president of the local oil company, offers to buy it for her if she will allow him to dump his oil runoff in the lake. Lois reluctantly accepts his offer, but as the opening of the new runoff pipe begins, Lois realizes the error of her ways and closes the valve to the pipe and resigns her position as mayor, stating that she was consumed by <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>power,</b> which led her to become the very same things she set out to destroy. Lois then allows West to have his job as mayor back, but a random bystander points out that neither Lois nor Mayor West has any jurisdiction to do so, and that the city has to have a whole new election to decide who gets to be the mayor of Quahog. This prompts West to pull out a gun and shoot him, as well as two others whom he believes objected.|$|E
