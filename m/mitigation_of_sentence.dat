5000|$|Most of {{the victims}} were small {{business}} owners, including doner kebab vendors and greengrocers. They were murdered in daylight with gunshots to the face at close range with a silenced CZ 83 pistol. According to the parents of a Turkish victim who worked in an internet café, the police originally suspected foreign organised criminals. Policewoman Michèle Kiesewetter was also shot and killed and the police officer on patrol with her was critically wounded. Other crimes, including a bomb attack, may have been committed by the group. German authorities identified three suspects, Uwe Böhnhardt, Uwe Mundlos, and Beate Zschäpe as responsible for the murders. According to the acting Attorney General of Germany, Rainer Greisbaum, the suspects had Neo-Nazi links. Böhnhardt and Mundlos were found dead by police after they robbed a bank on 4 November 2011. Police said they killed themselves. Zschäpe surrendered on 11 November 2011. She will probably face charges of murder, attempted murder, arson, and belonging to a terrorist organization. Zschäpe said she was only willing to testify if she was considered a state witness, with <b>mitigation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence.</b> The police discovered an alleged hit-list of 88 names that included [...] "two prominent members of the Bundestag and representatives of Turkish and Islamic groups".|$|E
5000|$|This is {{an aspect}} of a more general {{insanity}} defense (see the M'Naghten Rules). The defense [...] "was first recognized by Scottish common law to reduce the punishment of the partially insane." [...] It developed from the practice of juries in the 19th century of returning verdicts of guilty with a recommendation as to mercy or <b>mitigation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> to reflect any extenuating circumstances. In a series of decisions, given mainly by Lord Deas, a doctrine grew that various types of mental weakness could {{have the effect of}} reducing what would otherwise be a conviction for murder (which attracted capital punishment) to one for culpable homicide (where the courts had greater discretion in sentencing). An example of a [...] "diminished capacity" [...] might be extremely low intelligence. In the English case of R v Raven, a man who had a physical age of 22 years but a mental age of only 9 years felt provoked by homosexual advances and killed his perceived attacker. His mental deficiency was not in dispute and, since a child of 9 years would not have been criminally responsible (see s50 Children and Young Persons Act 1933), and his mental responsibility for his acts was substantially impaired, manslaughter was the only realistic verdict. The rationale of the defense is that, as a precondition to punishment, the criminal law requires conduct to be voluntary. If something interferes with the capacity of the individual to choose to break the law, this should be reflected by an excuse or exculpation. The law should balance the need to be fair to the individual wrongdoer, but equally offer some protection to society from a person who may not have complete control over their behavior.|$|E

40|$|Because criminals {{discount}} the future, the deterrence and retributive {{value of a}} given criminal sanction steadily decreases as the lag between crime and punishment lengthens. Discounting thus implies that the same nominal sentence will have disparate discounted values when imposed after different lags. Since lags between crime and punishment are both ubiquitous and widely-varying, pre-conviction delays constitute an important (and hitherto overlooked) source <b>of</b> <b>sentencing</b> disparities. Because the <b>mitigation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentencing</b> disparities is an important aim of criminal law, this essay proposes maintaining constant discounted sentencing terms by adjusting individual sanctions {{to account for the}} lag between crime and punishment. These adjustments may be large since the lag between crime and punishment is often lengthy and criminals may {{discount the}} future rapidly. Applying similar reasoning, the essay also proposes that convicted pretrial detainees should receive 2 ̆ 2 interest 2 ̆ 2 in addition to credit for time served since their sentences begin earlier and have greater discounted values...|$|R

40|$|First {{published}} in February 2008, the research paper {{was written in}} response to the abolition of provocation as a partial defence to murder following the Victorian Law Reform Commission 2 ̆ 7 s review of defences to homicide. The Commission recommended that, rather than raising a partial defence to murder, provocation should simply be taken into account in the sentencing process along with the other relevant circumstances of an offence. However, the Commission left open the question of what approach sentencing courts should take in assessing provocation that is raised in <b>mitigation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> under the new law. The research paper analyses how provocation might be considered in sentencing fatal and non-fatal offences against the person. The paper suggests a new approach to considering provocation as a mitigating factor in sentencing (summarised in Chapter 10).

40|$|This Note {{considers}} the self-incrimination dilemma {{raised by a}} capital defendant 2 ̆ 7 s allocution statements at the sentencing phase of his trial. Allocution gives a defendant {{the opportunity to make}} a direct plea to the sentencing judge or jury. However, in a system where reversals are common, admissions made at sentencing in one trial may be used against the defendant at retrial, chilling the practice. After examining the origins of this country 2 ̆ 7 s bifurcated system of capital punishment and tracing the evolution of the common law right of allocution, the author contends that this ancient practice should assume a greater role in the sentencing phase of modern capital trials. The author argues that, {{in the context of a}} separate sentencing phase whose primary aim is to achieve an individualized determination of punishment, allocution performs a valuable role in providing the sentencer with greater information upon which to base its decision. While there is no constitutional doctrine that mandates use immunity in this context, there are powerful policy concerns that support such a rule. The right to be heard from personally may both aid in <b>mitigation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> and broaden the participation of a defendant in his own trial. However, it is also in the state 2 ̆ 7 s interest, in imposing its most severe sanction, to reach the most informed result. In order to encourage allocution at capital sentencing, the author proposes granting use immunity to allocution statements, thereby preventing them from being used against a defendant at retrial...|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} the classic {{question of the}} tension between military discipline and individual responsibility; and whether {{and to what extent}} following superior orders may constitute a circumstance excluding criminal liability. Unlawful acts performed pursuant to superior orders can be regarded as a question of necessity – “I was forced to act” – or as a question of mistake of law – “I did not know it was wrong”. Unlike in international criminal law, in Norwegian law necessity can justify an otherwise criminal act but not all actions are justifiable: for example, sacrificing innocent lives to save another life will never be a lawful act of necessity. This may in the author’s view lead to the unreasonably strict enforcement of the law and a soldier could thus be found guilty of manslaughter for failing to be a hero in an impossible situation. Though <b>mitigation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> is granted, the label of guilt remains. There is no criminal responsibility without subjective guilt, but to plead ignorance of the law – “mistake of law” – has in Norwegian general criminal law very rarely led to the exclusion of criminal liability. In the Norwegian military criminal code, however, the subordinate is relieved of criminal responsibility for acts performed in compliance with an order unless the subordinate knew or should have known that the order was unlawful. It is the author’s view that soldiers and officers who comply with superior orders are thus treated more leniently than people in general. Furthermore, this may imply the – much contested – possibility of being acquitted for certain war crimes when these are not manifestly unlawful. One example is when a soldier mistakenly considers certain civilian conduct to be direct participation in hostilities, which would temporarily make the civilian a lawful target. This mistake would result in a direct attack on protected persons – a war crime...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{intended}} to discover a unified and scientific theory of breaches of criminal procedure and their results. In Chapter One, I provide readers with a way of navigating the argument. In Chapter Two, England, Germany and China are the representative jurisdictions. I then try to harmonise ‘criminal procedure’ and ‘xing-shi su-song-fa’ in Chinese. In Chapter Three, a criminal procedure rule is composed of a procedural direction and the consequence of its breach. Weaknesses in procedural remedies exist in every jurisdiction. In Chapter Four, two obstacles are cleared up: the Anglo-American suspicions about universal legal theory and the antagonistic position between socialist and capitalist laws. Two scientific factors are found: three objectives of criminal procedure: substantive truth, procedural regularity and legal harmony; criminal procedural conduct as the analytical unit. In Chapter Five, civil juristic act theory cannot be mechanically transplanted. Two categorisations are found useful: disposition-influencing conduct, procedure-inducing conduct and adjudicative conduct; conduct by a person in authority and conduct by a person not in authority. In Chapter Six, there are simply proclaimed rules and nullity-backed rules. Breaches of nullity-backed rules can be either absolutely null or relatively null. The treatment of relatively null conducts is either nullification or regularisation. There are three conventional nullifications: reversal of adjudicative conduct; exclusion of disposition-influencing conduct and nullification of procedure-inducing conduct. Regularisation is divided into disposal and overlooking. If substantive aspects are examined, <b>mitigation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> and ending of proceedings may be applied. Transmutation of invalid procedural conduct is a peculiar treatment. Then, I briefly integrate the subordinate procedural mechanisms in terms of institutional arrangements and structural constraints. In Chapter Seven, I explore the function of this theory in terms of theoretical guidance, legislation and legal practice, although discretion is unavoidable for deciding the final consequence of many breaches.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two {{parallel}} debates. The first concerns {{the fact that}} premenstrual syndrome (PMS) can be recognised by the criminal law and {{used as the basis}} of an excuse or in mitigation. The second takes as its starting point the existing academic criticism of the infanticide offence/defence, which in turn gives rise {{to the question of whether}} postnatal illnesses should be able to give rise to a criminal defence or be employed as a factor that goes to <b>mitigation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence.</b> In order to move both debates further, I draw on theories from medicine, philosophy and law and I consider the following issues and their impact on the specific questions in this thesis: 1) When are particular symptoms or experiences classified as disease or illness and what is the significance of these labels? 2) What is the theoretical basis for holding an individual criminally responsible and when should people suffering from mental disorder be wholly or partially excused or be able to raise a condition in mitigation? 3) To what extent does the existing criminal law meet these requirements and/or how should it be reformed in order to do so? I begin by looking at the current legal position and at the way in which the legal debate in this area has been conducted so far. I identify a number of questions that have characterised the so-called ‘feminist debate’ which centres around authors who object to the formal recognition of female-specific medical problems for gender-political reasons. An examination of the principal medical literature on both conditions demonstrates that although the symptoms and aetiologies of the two conditions are not settled, their existence is not doubted by medical science. Furthermore, both can be regarded as subcategories of the generic group of mental disorders categorised as depression. I answer the question of when something is considered a disease by demonstrating the philosophical underpinnings of the concept. The disease and illness labels are used to signify that an individual is not regarded as responsible for their symptoms and thus is excused by society from partaking in their normal social role when ill.

40|$|This {{paper had}} its genesis 10 {{years ago in}} the authors’ {{development}} of a communitarian ‘three circle’ model of restorative and transformative justice for a pilot restorative justice study used with serious and repeat adult offenders appearing in the Magistrates’ Courts in Western Australia. The model was designed in part to place their crimes within a context, something that rarely occurs within the mainstream adversarial criminal justice system in Australia. The model was primarily designed to provide victims of crime with the best outcome and offenders with the opportunity to provide apology and restitution, as well as take responsibility for their actions. The three circles, each including two facilitators, are: Circle 1 : consists of the perpetrator who has pleaded guilty to a specified criminal act together with his/her family and/or friends; Circle 2 : consists of the victim(s) of the crime together with their family and/or friends. Circle 3 : consists of a combination of the first two circles, tasked to seek, if possible, a mutually agreeable resolution that culminates in a report to present to the Magistrate in court to use in <b>mitigation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentencing.</b> Importantly, although the 30 -month study had socially and economically significant results, 10 years after its completion there is still no restorative justice program in the adult courts in Western Australia.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} problems associated with acting under orders. Bearing in mind that all the recipients of orders are beholden to their superiors, and every citizen is beholden not only to the laws of the state but also to his conscience, the question arises as {{to the extent to which}} the obedience of the person carrying out the orders should or can exempt him from punishment. This paper seeks to answer the question of the actual content, in German and in international law, of the regulations pertaining to actions carried out in compliance with orders, and in particular whether such actions represents particular grounds for exemption from punishment or should only be considered within the framework of other reasons for granting exemption from punishment. Answers will be sought to the question of whether acting under orders should represent grounds for exemption from punishment in a stricter sense or merely grounds for <b>mitigation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence.</b> This question is based on the interplay of international and national criminal law precepts and consequently it concerns the point of intersection between international law and criminal law. Therefore it was necessary to investigate the primary sources of international law to that effect in terms of art. 38 Section 1 of the ICJ Statute. International agreements, international legal custom and legal principles as recognized by civilized nations can be seen as the primary sources of international law. The primary sources of international law are the aforementioned forms of lawmaking inasmuch as the process whereby a law as such is created already provides a sufficient basis for legal validity for the ensuing rights and obligations. In addition to the three primary sources of international law the essential aspect was to consider the most important judicial decisions and the decisive learned opinions as an aid to achieving a judicial finding in terms of art. 38 Section 1 lit. of the ICJ Statute. Finally, an elicitation was necessary of the rulings by international organizations, i. e. by intergovernmental and non-governmental international organizations, which are described in art. 38 I of the ICJ Statute as not being legal sources sui generis, but which are increasingly important in the evolution of international law. Finally it should be pointed out that, in contrast to domestic law, international law does not recognize any limitation on the types of lawmaking...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine whether the plea {{bargaining}} in the context of “Lava Jato” Operation is adopting a third route of criminal law against administrative corruption, in which reparation of damages is established as one of the primary objectives of criminal prosecution, in substitution or <b>mitigation</b> <b>of</b> the restrictive <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> the collaborating defendants. Subsequent to this analysis, it is intended to reflect if the adoption of a third route of criminal law by means of these negotiating instruments could imply in the utilitarian mercantilization of the criminal process prejudicial to the principle of criminal legality, proportionality and isonomy in the application of the punishment. This is a necessary and pertinent analysis due to the protagonism that the plea-bargaining have been assuming in the discovery of great corruption schemes in Brazil and the recovery of assets. The procedural methodology is the bibliographic and the method of approach is the hypothetico-deductive one, besides the case study involving “Lava Jato” operation.

6000|$|I do {{not think}} there had ever been much {{intimacy}} between the Tedhams and the Haskeths, before Tedham's calamity came upon him. But Mrs. Hasketh did not refuse her share of it. She came forward, and probably made her husband come forward, in Tedham's behalf, and do what hopelessly {{could be done to}} defend him where there was really no defence, and the only thing to be attempted was to show circumstances that might perhaps tend to the <b>mitigation</b> <b>of</b> his <b>sentence.</b> I {{do not think}} they did. Tedham had confessed himself and had been proven such a thorough rogue, and the company had lately suffered so much through operations like his, that, even if it could have had mercy, as an individual may, mercy was felt to be bad morals, and the case was unrelentingly pushed. His <b>sentence</b> was <b>of</b> those <b>sentences</b> which an eminent jurist once characterized as rather dramatic; it was pronounced not so much in relation to his particular offence, as with the purpose of striking terror into all offenders like him, who were becoming altogether too common. He was made to suffer for many other peculators, who had been, or were about to be, and was given the full penalty. I was in court when it was pronounced with great solemnity by the judge, who read him a lecture in doing so; I could have read the judge another, for I could not help feeling that it was, more than all the sentences I had ever heard pronounced, wholly out of keeping with the offence. I met Hasketh coming out of the court-room, and I said that I thought it was terribly severe. He agreed with me, and as I knew that he and Tedham had never liked each other, I inferred a kindliness in him which made me his friend, in the way one is the friend of a man one never meets. He was a man of few words, and he now simply said, [...] "It was unjust," [...] and we parted.|$|R
40|$|The 17 th {{century was}} a time of change in Sweden. During the century many of the Swedish laws were altered. In the {{beginning}} of the 17 th century this alteration resulted in a more severe <b>sentence</b> for most <b>of</b> the committed crimes, but a <b>mitigation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sentence</b> for some <b>of</b> those crimes was effected {{in the middle of the}} 17 th century. The aim of this study is to see how two local courts in the judicial system during the mid 17 th century in Sweden treated adultery, and those who committed the crime against the background of what the law regarding adultery stipulated. The source material used are court records from Fryksdals hundred and Jösse hundred in western Sweden, and laws regarding adultery during the 17 th century. This research shows that the laws regarding adultery were in themselves not gender specific, and their main concern was the marital status of those involved. The punishment for all forms of adultery was a death sentence during the first half of the 17 th century, but during the latter part of the century the punishment for a specific form of adultery, when only one of the involved was married, was mitigated to a fine which differed according to marital status. In most of the cases both courts in Fryksdals hundred and Jösse hundred applied the law as it was written in their verdict, and the verdicts of acquittals were few. There is however a tendency in the findings towards a difference between the actual local courts at the end of the first half of the 17 th century. Court records show that Fryksdals hundred, which generally had more crimes regarding adultery than Jösse hundred, during that time applied a more rigorous attitude towards those crimes. The conclusion is that, although the results from both hundreds do not differ much from the general picture of adultery in Sweden, there is still a tendency of a difference between the actual local courts themselves...|$|R
