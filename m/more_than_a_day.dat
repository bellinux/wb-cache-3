5|$|England batted {{again and}} Tallon {{dismissed}} George Emmett from Lindwall with a diving one-handed catch. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, {{who took it}} {{in his right hand}} with a dive, leaving England at 1/1. England then declared at 3/174; Tallon conceded nine byes and with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> was lost to rain, Tallon was not required as Australia batted out the last session for a draw.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Klein's {{division}} {{was part of}} the newly created VIII. Corps, under command of Édouard Mortier; the role of the Corps was to patrol and secure the northern shore of the Danube river, limiting the Austro-Russian activity. Napoleon incorrectly assumed that the Russians and the Austrians would make a stand near St. Pölten, northwest of Vienna. Klein's entire regiment of dragoons patrolled the northern Danube shore, while the rest of his division, the last in the extended line of march, was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> behind Maxime Gazan's lead division. Klein's division did not take part in the Battle of Dürenstein, although his dragoons were with Mortier and Gazan immediately prior to the engagement.|$|E
5|$|In England's second innings, Gooch {{played a}} lone hand. With the {{exception}} of Foster (34), promoted as nightwatchman {{at the end of}} day two, no-one else passed 15. When Gooch was last man out for 84 on the third day, England had compiled 202. The England bowlers managed to restrain the West Indian batsmen, Childs notably bowling 40 overs for just 79 runs, but, with more than two days left to play, there was little pressure on the West Indies, and they strolled to victory in 91 overs, losing just two wickets, with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> to spare.|$|E

5|$|Most early {{accounts}} {{place the}} size of the Muslim forces between 24,000 and 40,000 and the number of Byzantine forces between 100,000 and 400,000. Modern estimates for the sizes of the respective armies vary: the vast majority of estimates for the Byzantine army are between 80,000 and 150,000, while other estimates are as low as 15,000 to 20,000. Estimates for the Rashidun army are between 25,000 and 40,000. Original accounts are mostly from Arab sources, generally agreeing that the Byzantine army and their allies outnumbered the Muslim Arabs by a sizeable margin. The only early Byzantine source is Theophanes, who wrote a century later. Accounts of the battle vary, some stating it lasted a day, others <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although still {{a minimal}} {{tropical}} storm at the time, the CPHC anticipated Neki {{to become a}} hurricane as it tracked northwestward. As such, they issued a hurricane watch for Johnston Island {{on the afternoon of}} October19. The following day, the hurricane watch was replaced by a tropical storm watch as Neki was no longer forecast to pass close enough to the island to produce hurricane-force winds. Later that day, a hurricane watch was issued for the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Lisianski Island. The following morning, a supplementary hurricane warning was issued for the monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa. Additionally, the tropical storm watch for Johnston Island was discontinued. Early on October22, the hurricane watch for Lisianski Island to Marco Reef was replaced by a tropical storm watch. Several hours later, the CPHC discontinued this watch. Early on October23, as Neki weakened to a tropical storm, the hurricane warning for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa was replaced by a tropical storm warning. The tropical storm warning remained in effect for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> before being canceled during the afternoon of October24.|$|E

25|$|The Mount Lowe Railway {{was born}} from a {{desire of the}} Pasadena Pioneers to have a scenic {{mountain}} railroad to {{the crest of the}} San Gabriel Mountains.

Several proposals were floated to establish some sort of mechanical transportation to the summits, but they all lacked funding.|$|E
