40|$|A flight {{printed wiring}} board (PWB) for a {{satellite}} project was observed {{to have a high}} incidence of <b>measling.</b> Other PWB's produced for the program by the same manufacturer did not exhibit the degree of <b>measling</b> as did the 'measle-prone' board. <b>Measling</b> susceptibility during hand soldering and <b>measling</b> effects on PWB insulation resistance were investigated for three production PWB's. <b>Measling</b> resistance was significantly different between the three boards: the 'worst' exhibited five times the number of measles as the 'best' board. 'Severe' <b>measling</b> (that which is likely to affect board reliability) did not exist on the 'best' board, even under extreme soldering conditions (399 degrees C for 12 - 15 sec.), whereas the 'worst' board showed an average of one 'severe' measle for every two pads under more normal soldering conditions (288 - 343 degrees C for 2 - 5 sec.). Both soldering time and temperature affected <b>measling,</b> with time having a slightly greater influence (2 percent versus 12 percent). <b>Measling</b> effects on PWB insulation resistance were inconclusive. These were evaluated by in situ resistance measurements on the same three boards at elevated temperature and humidity. The measured resistance for all three boards decreased for exposures greater than 50 degrees C and 50 percent relative humidity. The 'measle-prone' board showed a resistance decrease at only 25 degrees C and 50 percent relative humidity. However, no definitive difference was detected between measled and not-measled (control) samples. The boards evaluated were production boards, so the effect of interlayer traces connecting the plated-through holes was not controlled. It is likely the resistance measurements were over different volumes of PWB laminate, which would account for the widely varying resistances measured. Thermomechanical measurements on board laminate materials did not reveal any differences attributed to <b>measling.</b> Differences in glass transition temperature were significantly different when measured by DTA, but not by SDT. Laminate thermal expansion differences were significant for the 35 degrees C evaluations, but not for any higher temperatures...|$|E
