[...] The First Edition's 1968 hit, [...] "Just Dropped In (To See What Condition <b>My</b> <b>Condition</b> Was In)", contains a {{reference to}} the song with the line [...] "I tripped on a cloud and fell a-eight miles high."

500|$|By {{this time}} some early {{supporters}} of Joyce's work, such as Ezra Pound and the author's brother Stanislaus Joyce, had grown increasingly unsympathetic {{to his new}} writing. In {{order to create a}} more favourable critical climate, a group of Joyce's supporters (including Samuel Beckett, William Carlos Williams, Rebecca West and others) put together a collection of critical essays on the new work. It was published in 1929 under the title Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress. In July 1929, increasingly demoralised by the poor reception his new work was receiving, Joyce approached his friend James Stephens about the possibility of his completing the book. Joyce wrote to Weaver in late 1929 that he had [...] "explained to [...] all about the book, at least a great deal, and he promised me that if I found it madness to continue, in <b>my</b> <b>condition,</b> and saw no other way out, that he would devote himself heart and soul to the completion of it, that is the second part and the epilogue or fourth." [...] Apparently Joyce chose Stephens on superstitious grounds, as he had been born in the same hospital as Joyce, exactly one week later, and shared both the first names of Joyce himself and his fictional alter-ego Stephen Dedalus. In the end, Stephens was not asked to finish the book.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{score was}} composed by Carter Burwell, {{a veteran of}} all the Coen Brothers' films. While the Coens were writing the screenplay they had Kenny Rogers' [...] "Just Dropped In (to See What Condition <b>My</b> <b>Condition</b> Was in)", the Gipsy Kings' cover of [...] "Hotel California", and several Creedence Clearwater Revival songs in mind. They asked T-Bone Burnett (who would later work with the Coens on O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Inside Llewyn Davis) to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film. They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but, as Joel remembers, [...] "T-Bone even came up with some far-out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac." [...] Burnett was able to secure songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by Captain Beefheart, Moondog and Bob Dylan's [...] "The Man in Me" [...] (from New Morning). However, he {{had a tough time}} securing the rights to Townes Van Zandt's cover of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Dead Flowers", which plays over the film's closing credits. Former Stones manager Allen Klein owned the rights to the song and wanted $150,000 for it. Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers, [...] "It got to the part where the Dude says, 'I hate the fuckin' Eagles, man!' Klein stands up and says, 'That's it, you can have the song!' That was beautiful." [...] Burnett was going to be credited on the film as [...] "Music Supervisor", but asked his credit to be [...] "Music Archivist" [...] because he [...] "hated the notion of being a supervisor; I wouldn't want anyone to think of me as management".|$|E
