40|$|The {{development}} of highly integrated and compact micro-satellites {{and the need}} for a higher precision of positioning and attitude control in space missions has stimulated the {{development of}} micro-propulsion systems. At TU-Delft, investigations are focusing on non-chemical, thermal propulsion. TU-Delft is also collaborating with TNO and UTwente to develop a mini-propulsion system (T 3 -?ps) to be flown in 2011 as part of the MicroNed Nanosatellite Program. To complement these developments, the TU-Delft is developing test facilities and equipment for on ground testing of such systems. The most critical need is the ability to take thrust and impulse bit measurements with adequate accuracy and resolution. To this purpose, the TU-Delft has developed a thrust stand capable of measuring thrust levels in the range 100 - 1000 mN and <b>minimum</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>bit</b> of 5 mNs as well as a smaller stand capable of measuring thrusts ranging from 0. 5 - 50 mN and a <b>minimum</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>bit</b> of 0. 05 mNs.

In addition, for thruster testing under rough vacuum conditions, a Heraeus vacutherm oven has been successfully adapted.

The Propulsion and Cryogenic Advanced Development (PCAD) project has been tasked by NASA to develop this propulsion combination to enable safe and cost effective exploration missions. To date, limited experience with such combinations exist, {{and as a result}} a comprehensive test program is critical to demonstrating the viability of implementing such a system. The NASA Glenn Research Center has conducted a test program of a 100 -lbf (445 -N) reaction control engine (RCE) at the center s Altitude Combustion Stand (ACS), focusing on altitude testing over a wide variety of operational conditions.

The selected problem is concerned with determining design factor settings for an automated approach program which is to have the capability of guiding the Shuttle into the docking port of the Space Station under controlled conditions so as to meet and/or optimize certain target criteria. The candidate design parameters under study were glide path (i. e., approach) angle, path intercept and approach gains, and <b>minimum</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>bit</b> mode (a parameter which defines how Shuttle jets shall be fired). Several performance criteria were of concern: terminal relative velocity at the instant the two spacecraft are mated; docking offset; number of Shuttle jet firings in certain specified directions (of interest due to possible plume impingement on the Station's solar arrays), and total RCS (a measure of the energy expended in performing the approach/docking maneuver). In the material discussed here, we have focused on single performance criteria - total RCS. An analysis of the possibility of employing a multiobjective function composed of a weighted sum of the various individual criteria has been undertaken, but is, at this writing, incomplete. Results from the Taguchi statistical analysis indicate that only three of the original four posited factors are significant in affecting RCS response. A comparison of model simulation output (via Monte Carlo) with predictions based on estimated factor effects inferred through the Taguchi experiment array data suggested acceptable or close agreement between the two except at the predicted optimum point, where a difference outside a rule-of-thumb bound was observed.

All of these applications can make use {{of a new generation}} of highly capable micro-satellites. Advantages inherent with the use of small satellite formations include: - enhanced launch flexibility; on-orbit adaptability and reconfigurability; multi-mission capability; and mission longevity. These characteristics equate to greater responsiveness and increased performance requirements at lower costs. Specific applications well suited to small satellites include; space-based navigation and guidance for precision target tracking; high-bandwidth global communications for military forces utilizing space-to-space or space-to-ground laser communications; detection, and precise positional knowledge of enemy weapons of mass destruction (geolocation) using formation flying detector systems; formation satellite support of synthetic aperture radars; and precision proximity operations, to name but a few. Mobilizing these micro-satellites will require revolutionary propulsion systems designed for critical performance needs such as long-term maneuvers and precision control. The operational metrics to consider include reliability, safety, simplicity, and weight-constraints. The Hybrid Electric-Laser Propulsion (HELP) system responds to these needs. Modularity, compactness, use of a chemically-benign propellant, and the absence of pressurized tanks, valves, and high voltage supplies, make it an operationally preferable companion to small satellites for a wide range of on-orbit applications. The objective of our work is to demonstrate the feasibility of a HELP system combining features from current state-of-the-art electric and laser thruster technology with several new features developed by Design_Net Engineering. Short pulse-width Qswitched lasers have the ability to create super hot plasmas from a readily available, inexpensive, and environmentally benign propellant. The resulting plasma is contained and directed to provide uniquely high and scalable specific impulse and variable thrust. It also enables superior <b>minimum</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>bit</b> (MIB) and noise levels. The HELP system feeds propellant using a patent-pending system that ensures repeatability and efficient propellant usage. A simple “plug-in” interface to the host spacecraft bus can be easily integrated and robotically serviced onorbit. These features provide modularity, serviceability, and flexibility. The production of the HELP system will fill the current shortfall of cost effective enabling propulsion technologies for small satellite applications. Although some technological hurdles exist, they do not collectively appear to be “show stoppers”. This paper provides an overview of the status of current micro-propulsion systems, discusses associated problems and limitations of these systems in terms of key performance metrics and finally describes the HELP system, which is currently under development with support from DARPA...|$|E
40|$|Potential {{civilian}} and government users have expressed {{a strong interest}} in CubeSat class satellites for military, scientific and commercial purposes. The U. S. Air Force Research Laboratories (AFRL), using DARPA funding, have contracted with The Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, California to develop a CubeSat class spacecraft called the MEMS PicoSat Inspector (MEPSI). In turn, AFRL and Aerospace Corporation selected VACCO to provide a Micro-Propulsion System (MiPS) for MEPSI. This paper describes the resulting system design and its capabilities. Related micro-propulsion activities will also be reviewed including work with AeroAstro Inc. to develop an advanced MiPS using decomposing nitrous oxide as the propellant. The VACCO Micro-Propulsion System is an advanced subsystem based on our proprietary Chemically Etched Micro Systems (ChEMS) integrated fluidic circuit technology (patent # 6, 334, 301). Extremely flexible and easily expanded, MiPS can be adapted {{to a wide range of}} small spacecraft. The current isobutane unit can deliver 34 Newton-seconds of total impulse with over 61, 000 <b>minimum</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>bit</b> firings. MiPS brings true propulsion capabilities to micro-spacecraft for formation flying, attitude control and velocity change (delta-V). Reliability features such as all-welded titanium construction and redundant soft-seat microvalves compliment the simple selfpressurizing design. Instead of simply creating a miniature version of a conventional system, VACCO has taken a highly integrated system level approach that eliminates all tubing connections in favor of a single ChEMS manifold. When combined with our system-in-a-tank packaging design, the resulting propulsion system is a significant advancement over published alternatives. VACCO’s ChEMS Micro-Propulsion System is a titanium weldment about half the size of a VHS videocassette. Four ChEMS 55 mN Micro-Thrusters are located around the periphery of the module tilting 15 o toward the mounting plane. A single axial 55 mN Micro-Thruster is located in the center of the XY plane. The axial Micro-Thruster nozzle doubles as a fill/vent port for the system. Two sets of connector pins protrude from the Tank through glass headers to retain pressure while making electrical connections to the host MEPSI spacecraft. One flight MiPS unit has been designed, built and tested at both VACCO and Aerospace Corporation. This paper will describe the MiPS in sufficient detail for potential users to perform a preliminary assessment against their requirements. Performance test data will be presented and conclusions drawn. Lessons learned and future development plans will also be delineated. VACCO will also outline a plan for making MiPS available for University CubeSat projects. The idea is to build a number of sets of MiPS parts less the core assembly. The core assembly controls all component interconnections and tangential thruster geometry. These critical features could be designed by the student team in order to customize MiPS for their purposes. By stocking the machined parts, lead times can be reduced to less than four months. In this way, students can gain valuable skills and experience while keeping the entire project to less than one-year in duration. In addition to providing a learning experience, students would benefit from the enhanced capability and flexibility propulsion would bring to their CubeSat design...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} of electrode flare angle {{on the performance of}} Ablation Pulsed Plasma Thruster. Discharge character, plasma velocity and performance over different electrode flare angles of the Pulsed Plasma Thruster at 13. 5 J initial energy are measured experimentally, the effect of electrode flare angle on the electrode inductance gradient, equivalent circuit parameters and energy transfer efficiency are analyzed. It can be seen that the circuit parameters and inductance distribution are changed with electrode flare angle, the <b>impulse</b> <b>bit,</b> specific <b>impulse,</b> thruster efficiency and mean exhaust velocity increase non-linearly with flare angle increasing from 0 degree to 27 degree and the Pulsed Plasma Thruster gets the maximum thruster performance at 27 degree flare angle. It shows that with the increase of electrode flare angle the fraction of ablated mass accelerated magnetically and the <b>impulse</b> <b>bit</b> created by Lorentz force decrease are the reasons inducing the change in thruster performance...|$|R
40|$|A Pulsed Plasma Thruster (PPT) {{has been}} {{developed}} {{for use in a}} technology demonstration flight experiment on the Earth Observing 1 (EO- 1) New Millennium Program mission. The thruster replaces the spacecraft pitch axis momentum wheel for control and momentum management during an experiment of a minimum three-day duration. The EO- 1 PPT configuration is a combination of new technology and design heritage from similar systems flown in the 1970 's and 1980 's. Acceptance testing of the protoflight unit has validated readiness for flight, and integration with the spacecraft, including initial combined testing, has been completed. The thruster provides a range of capability from 90 microN-sec <b>impulse</b> <b>bit</b> at 650 sec specific impulse for 12 W input power, through 860 microN-sec <b>impulse</b> <b>bit</b> at 1400 see specific impulse for 70 W input power. Development of this thruster reinitiates technology research and development and re-establishes an industry base for production of flight hardware. This paper reviews the EO- 1 PPT development, including technology selection, design and fabrication, acceptance testing, and initial spacecraft integration and test...|$|R
