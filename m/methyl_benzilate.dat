40|$|A {{series of}} esters of 1 -alkyl- 2 -hydroxyalkylpyrrolidine and their {{quaternary}} derivatives {{have been shown}} to possess significant anti-acetylcholine activity. The benzilic acid esters were the most active, followed by xanthene- 9 -carboxylic acid, fluorene- 9 -carboxylic acid and diphenylacetic acid esters in that order. The quaternary derivatives were more active than their corresponding tertiary compounds both in vivo and in vitro. The most active compound of the series tested in vivo was (1 -methylpyrrolid- 2 -yl) <b>methyl</b> <b>benzilate</b> methiodide and was as potent as atropine. There was a progressive decrease in anti-acetylcholine activity and a proportional increase in local anaesthetic activity as the number of carbon atoms was increased from 1 to 3 in the pyrrolidyl side-chain of the tertiary salts of the benzilic acid ester series. Likewise increasing the size of the group on the nitrogen atom led to a decrease in anti-acetylcholine activity and an increase in local anaesthetic activity. Quaternization of the tertiary salts resulted in a loss of local anaesthetic activity. Most of the compounds tested possessed some antihistamine properties, while papaverine-like activity was confined to the tertiary salts only. No significant neuromuscular blocking activity was evident...|$|E
40|$|Many {{recent reports}} have {{indicated}} {{that the effect of}} the phorbol ester tumor promoters is mediated through the Ca 2 +/phospholipid dependent protein kinase C. We have investigated the effect of two biologically active phorbol esters, 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) and 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta, 13 alpha-didecanoate (beta PDD) on muscarinic agonist binding and receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide breakdown in cultured human neuroblastoma (SH-SY 5 Y) cells. Preincubation of these cells with phorbol esters significantly reduced the carbachol-stimulated breakdown of inositol phospholipids and caused a decrease of agonist affinity for [3 H](-) <b>methyl</b> quinuclidinyl <b>benzilate</b> ([3 H](-) MQNB) binding without affecting the affinity of antagonist to the muscarinic receptor. The nontumor promoting 4 alpha-phorbol 12 beta, 12 alpha-didecanoate (alpha PDD) was ineffective in our studies. These results suggest that the activation of protein kinase C may {{play an important role in}} regulating the muscarinic receptor syste...|$|R
