40|$|The goal of {{this chapter}} is to show how certain results {{in the study of}} quantum chaos can be used for the design of highly {{directional}} emission semiconductor micro lasers and resonant <b>multi-cavities.</b> For this, we first review some basic tools of chaos theory in classical mechanics, focusing on planar billiards (two-dimensional cavities). After pointing out that under certain conditions electromagnetic waves and scalar quantum waves are both governed by the same equation, we examine various novel ways of exploring the quantum-classical correspondence of chaotic systems. Having gained insight into the differences and similarities between ray and wave dynamics, it will be appreciated how mixed (regular and chaotic) dynamics is essential for the design of directional high-power micro lasers. Snell’s law and Fresnel theory of refraction will be then used to simulate the emission pattern and intensity of a micro laser constructed with a high-index semiconductor material.

Presently these accelerator facilities are operated with pulsed RF. In future, these facilities should be operated with continuous wave (CW) which requires significant modifications on the real-time feedbacks realized within the FPGA. For example, higher loaded quality factor of the cavities when operated in a CW mode requires sophisticated resonance control methods. However, iterative learning techniques widely used for machines operated in pulsed mode are not applicable for CW. In addition, the mechanical characteristic of the cavities have now a much more important impact on the choice of the feedback scheme. To overcome the limitations of classical PI-controllers novel real-time adaptive feed forward algorithm are implemented in the FPGA.
