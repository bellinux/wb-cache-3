40|$|The {{atypical}} {{protein kinase}} C (PKC) member PKC-ζ has {{been implicated in}} several signal transduction pathways regulating differentiation, proliferation or apoptosis of mammalian cells. We report here the identification of a cytoplasmic and membrane-associated protein that we name zeta-interacting protein (ZIP) and that interacts with the regulatory domain of PKC-ζ but not classic PKCs. The structural motifs in ZIP include a recently <b>defined</b> <b>ZZ</b> zinc finger as a potential protein binding module, two PEST sequences and a novel putative protein binding motif with the consensus sequence YXDEDX 5 SDEE/D. ZIP binds to the pseudosubstrate region in the regulatory domain of PKC-ζ and is phosphorylated by PKC-ζ in vitro. ZIP dimerizes via the same region that promotes binding to PKC-ζ suggesting a competitive situation between ZIP:ZIP and ZIP:PKC-ζ complexes. In the absence of PKC-ζ proper subcellular localization of ZIP is impaired and we show that intracellular targeting of ZIP is dependent on a balanced interaction with PKC-ζ. Taking into account the recent isolation of ZIP by others in different contexts we propose that ZIP may function as a scaffold protein linking PKC-ζ to protein tyrosine kinases and cytokine receptors...|$|R

Here we show that a network's large-scale topological organization and its local subgraph structure <b>mutually</b> <b>define</b> and predict each other, as confirmed by direct measurements in five well studied cellular networks. We also demonstrate the inherent existence of two distinct classes of subgraphs, and show that, in contrast to the low-density type II subgraphs, the highly abundant type I subgraphs cannot exist in isolation but must naturally aggregate into subgraph clusters. The identified topological framework may have important implications for our understanding of the origin and function of subgraphs in all complex networks. Comment: pape...|$|R

To answer this question, I discuss three families of accounts of legitimate authority: purely procedural, purely instrumental, and mutualdependence accounts. Purely procedural accounts take justice and authority to be altogether separate. Purely instrumental accounts make attributions of authority entirely dependent on institutions’ efficacy in realizing justice. Mutual-dependence accounts see justice and authority as <b>mutually</b> <b>defining</b> each other.

40|$|Norms {{of justice}} are often invoked {{to justify the}} {{globalisation}} of forest policies but are rarely critically analysed. This paper reviews elements of justice in the values, knowledge, access and property rights relating to forests, especially in developing countries. Rather than defining justice in general terms of distribution of benefits and recognition of stakeholders, we argue that these processes are <b>mutually</b> <b>defining,</b> and can foreclose what is distributed, and to whom. Much recent forest policy, for example, emphasises forest carbon stocks and the benefits to indigenous peoples; but these terms de-emphasise livelihood outcomes for forests, and non-indigenous smallholders. Accordingly, we argue that current operationalisations of justice in forest policy based on John Rawls' principles of fair allocation to known actors {{need to be replaced}} by Amartya Sen's more deliberative and inclusive vision of justice that focuses instead on how different users experience different benefits, and seek to achieve multiple objectives together. © 2013 The Authors.
