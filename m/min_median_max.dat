The algorithms take constant time per pixel to compute min or max filters and polylog time per pixel, {{in the size of}} the filter, to compute the median filter. 1 Introduction Order filters are widely used as an effective tool for reducing certain types of noise and periodic interference patterns in signals and images without severely degrading the signal [3]. One of the more useful properties of the median filter is that it many situations it doesn't blur edges and monotone changes in the signal but it cleans up sporadic noise. The min and max filters are the primitive operations for all of the so called morphological filters [4, 6]. In this paper we describe fast algorithms to compute <b>min,</b> <b>median,</b> <b>max</b> or any other order statistic filter transforms and show lower bounds for their computation.

40|$|ABSTRACT:- Noise in {{the digital}} images {{has become a major}} area of {{research}} due to increasing the role of visual sensors in embedded applications. This paper has proposed a new approach which that has improved the sorted switching median filter by using the optimistic replacement of noisy pixel. The Optimistic Replacement Based Switching Median Filter (ORSMF) also called Multiple selection policy (MSP) has used the optimistic noise replacement instead of local median. It has also preserved the edges using image gradients and border exchanging used to preserve the borders. The proposed technique seems to be effective as it has replaced the noisy pixel with its best suitable alternative by taking more than one replacements for the noisy pixel. The optimistic replacement includes the median of medians (also called hybrid <b>median),</b> <b>min</b> of <b>medians,</b> <b>max</b> of <b>medians,</b> mean of medians etc. Experiments have been done in MATLAB using image processing toolbox in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the proposed technique.

There have been few studies on the comparative effectiveness of these control techniques. We evaluated three bed bug management strategies in an apartment building: (1) non-chemical methods only (n = 9); (2) insecticides only (n = 6); and (3) integrated pest management including both non-chemical methods and insecticides (n = 9). The apartments were one-bedroom units occupied by seniors or people with disabilities. Bed bug numbers in each apartment were determined by visual inspection and/or installing intercepting devices under bed and sofa legs. The <b>median</b> (<b>min,</b> <b>max)</b> bed bug counts in the non-chemical methods only, insecticides only, and integrated pest management (IPM) treatment were: 4 (1, 57), 19 (1, 250), and 14 (1, 219), respectively prior to the treatments. The apartments were retreated if found necessary during biweekly to monthly inspections.

40|$|The {{concept of}} time-constrained SQL queries was {{introduced}} {{to address the problem}} of long-running SQL queries. A key approach adopted for supporting time-constrained SQL queries is to use sampling to reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed, thereby allowing completion of the query in the specified time constraint. However, sampling does make the query results approximate and hence requires the system to estimate the values of the expressions (especially aggregates) occurring in the select list. Thus, coming up with estimates for aggregates is crucial for time-constrained approximate SQL queries to be useful, which is the focus of this paper.

40|$|Background and Aim: Breast {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer death among women, both in Iran and worldwide. The wide {{variation}} in breast cancer incidence in different geographical areas calls for studies to clarify the role of potential risk factors. In this study we looked at some factors that could be involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Material and Methods: This matched case-control study was carried out in the summer of 2004, and it drew on data recorded in Babol (Caspian) Cancer Registry. We investigated 250 biopsy-proven cases of breast cancer, together with 500 controls chosen from the neighbors of cases. We matched the subjects with regard to age (with 3 years intervals). Crude and adjusted odds ratios and relevant 95 % confidence intervals were calculated through conditional logistic regression, using STATA 8. 0. Results: This study involved 250 incident cases of breast cancer and 500 age-matched controls. The mean age of the cases was 48. 7 (Â± 11. 37) years with 48, 22 and 80 years as <b>median,</b> <b>min.</b> and <b>max.</b> values, respectively. Mean age in the controls was 48. 0 (Â± 11. 46) years with 47. 5, 19 and 77 years as <b>median,</b> <b>min.</b> and <b>max.</b> values, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the following variables were found to be risk factors: university education (OR= 5. 89, 95 %CI: 1. 73 - 20. 09), menopause (OR= 3. 98, 95 %CI: 2. 29 - 6. 91), induced abortion (OR= 1. 56, 95 %CI: 1. 02 - 2. 22), BMI (OR= 1. 02, 95 %CI: 1. 01 - 1. 03) and longer duration of breast feeding was determined as protective factor against breast cancer (OR= 0. 995, 95 %CI: 0. 990 - 0. 999). Conclusion: Modifiable risk factors should be considered in the community-based preventive interventions. The following areas could serve as topics for community education in Mazandaran: the role of high BMI and induced abortion in increasing the chance of breast cancer and also the protective role of breast feeding on this issue...|$|R
40|$|Lipoprotein(a) is an {{independent}} risk factor for premature coronary artery disease (Erqou 2009). The physiological role of liver synthesized lipoprotein is still unclear. The cut off-value to define elevated lipoprotein(a) was determined arbitrarily at 30 mg/dl (Graham 2007). Patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) can develop premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases {{even in the absence}} of other risk factors. Furthermore, cerebrovascular disease and the peripheral arterial occlusive disease are related with elevated lipoprotein(a) -levels (Jones 2007). These cannot sufficiently be influenced either by standard hypolipemic diet or by drug therapy. It has been reported that a 4 g dose of Nicotinic Acid can reduce lipoprotein(a) by up to 38 % (Carlson 1989). Such high doses are restricted in use because of the main adverse reaction of skin flushes. New drugs which are still in a state of devolvement and testing are Mipomersen Sodium, an antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits the synthesis of apolipoprotein B- 100 as well as Eprotirome, a selective thyroid hormone analogue. At the moment lipid apheresis, apart from the drug therapy with nicotinic acid, is the only option to lower lipoprotein(a) levels significantly in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a). There is a lack of prospective, randomized studies on the effect of apheresis on the course of cardiovascular diseases in patients with isolated elevated lipoprotein(a). The goal of this retrospective observational study is to monitor and analyze the effect of lipid apheresis on the course of cardiovascular diseases in patients with isolated elevated lipoprotein(a). Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were chosen as progression parameters. Furthermore, the efficiency of lipid apheresis on the reduction of the lipid parameters, notably lipoprotein(a), was analyzed. Finally, the obtained data should be used as a basis for future studies. This retrospective study investigates the courses of 15 patients treated in the lipid-clinic at the CharitÃ© University hospital Berlin with lipid apheresis for isolated elevated lipoprotein(a) and progressive cardiovascular disease. The number of events and the number of interventions are compared before the start of the apheresis (starting with first manifestation) and the period with apheresis therapy (until the end of the treatment investigation in July 2007) and analyzed individually for each patient and each year. Furthermore, the lipid lowering effect of the apheresis therapy was investigated. The median of the investigation period before the start of the apheresis therapy is 3 years (min. 8 months, max. 30 years and 8. 5 months). With therapy the median of the investigations period is 2 years and 5 month (min. 1 year, max 9 years and 5 months). The rate of events decreased significantly from 0. 37 (<b>median,</b> <b>min.</b> 0, <b>max</b> 2. 5) to 0 events per patient and year (<b>median,</b> <b>min.</b> 0, <b>max.</b> 1, P = 0. 013). The rate of interventions per patient and year decreased significantly from 1. 3 (<b>median,</b> <b>min.</b> 0. 07, <b>max.</b> 4. 71) to 0 interventions per patient and year (<b>median,</b> <b>min.</b> 0, <b>max.</b> 0. 09, P = 0. 002). For single apheresis sessions significant acute lowering of lipoprotein(a) up to 70. 2 % (<b>max.,</b> <b>median</b> 66. 0 %, min. 55. 7 %, P = 0. 001) from pre-apheresis levels of 83. 3 mg/dl (<b>median,</b> <b>min.</b> 62 mg/dl, <b>max</b> 155. 7 mg/dl) were obtained. The statistical significance of these findings has to be scrutinized critically due to the sample number of monitored patients and the different investigation periods. However the results of event and intervention rate are promising. Furthermore, these data showed evidence of the efficacy of lipid apheresis. In June 2008 the Federal Joint Committee has authorized the use of lipid apheresis in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) > 60 mg/dl suffering from progressive cardiovascular disease (coronary, peripheral, and cerebrovascular arterial disease), despite optimal established therapy. Simultaneously, care providers were obliged to initiate an apheresis register and to conduct a controlled study to prove the efficacy of lipid apheresis for this indication and to improve the evidence. Therefore, based on our data, a prospective, randomized, controlled trial was designed to prove the hypothesis that lipid apheresis decreases vascular events. At present ethical issues of the randomized study design are being discussed...|$|R

40|$|Introduction A {{stay in the}} {{intensive}} care unit (ICU), although potentially life-saving, may cause considerable discomfort to patients. However, retrospective assessment of discomfort is difficult because recollection of stressful events may be impaired by sedation and severe illness during the ICU stay. This study addresses the following questions. What is the incidence of discomfort reported by patients recently discharged from an ICU? What were the sources of discomfort reported? What was the degree of factual recollection during patients' stay in the ICU? Finally, was discomfort reported more often in patients with good factual recollection? Methods All ICU patients older than 18 years who had needed prolonged (> 24 hour) admission with tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were consecutively included. Within three days after discharge from the ICU, a structured, in-person interview was conducted with each individual patient. All patients were asked to complete a questionnaire consisting of 14 questions specifically concerning the environment of the ICU they had stayed in. Furthermore, they were asked whether they remembered any discomfort during their stay; if they did then they were asked to specify which sources of discomfort they could recall. A reference group of surgical ward patients, matched by sex and age to the ICU group, was studied to validate the questionnaire. Results A total of 125 patients discharged from the ICU were included in this study. Data for 123 ICU patients and 48 surgical ward patients were analyzed. The prevalence of recollection of any type of discomfort in the ICU patients was 54 % (n = 66). These 66 patients were asked to identify the sources of discomfort, and presence of an endotracheal tube, hallucinations and medical activities were identified as such sources. The <b>median</b> (<b>min</b> - <b>max)</b> score for factual recollection in the ICU patients was 15 (0 - 28). The <b>median</b> (<b>min</b> - <b>max)</b> score for factual recollection in the reference group was 25 (19 - 28). Analysis revealed that discomfort was positively related to factual recollection (odds ratio 1. 1; P < 0. 001), especially discomfort caused by the presence of an endotracheal tube, medical activities and noise. Hallucinations were reported more often with increasing age. Pain as a source of discomfort was predominantly reported by younger patients. Conclusion Among postdischarge ICU patients, 54 % recalled discomfort. However, memory was often impaired: the median factual recollection score of ICU patients was significantly lower than that of matched control patients. The presence of an endotracheal tube, hallucinations and medical activities were most frequently reported as sources of discomfort. Patients with a higher factual recollection score were at greater risk for remembering the stressful presence of an endotracheal tube, medical activities and noise. Younger patients were more likely to report pain as a source of discomfort...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Biometric {{authentication}} is {{a process}} of verifying an identity claim using a personâs behavioural and physiological characteristics. Due to the vulnerability of the system to environmental noise and variation caused by the user, fusion of several biometric-enabled systems is identified as a promising solution. In the literature, various fixed rules (e. g. <b>min,</b> <b>max,</b> <b>median,</b> mean) and trainable classifiers (e. g. linear combination of scores or weighted sum) are used to combine the scores of several base-systems. How exactly do correlation and imbalance nature of base-system performance affect the fixed rules and trainable classifiers? We study these joint aspects using the commonly used error measurement in biometric authentication, namely Equal Error Rate (EER). Similar to several previous studies in the literature, the central assumption used here is that the class-dependent scores of a biometric system are approximately normally distributed. However, different from them, the novelty {{of this study is to}} make a direct link between the EER measure and the fusion schemes mentioned. Both synthetic and real experiments (with as many as 256 fusion experiments carried out on the XM 2 VTS benchmark score-level fusion data sets) verify our proposed theoretical modeling of EER of the two families of combination scheme. In particular, it is found that weighted sum can provide the best generalisation performance when its weights are estimated correctly. It also has the additional advantage that score normalisation prior to fusion is not needed, contrary to the rest of fixed fusion rules. ...|$|R

Following intramuscular medetomidine (20 Î¼g/kg) and morphine (0. 3 mg/kg) premedication, anaesthesia was induced and maintained with intravenous alfaxalone. Patients were breathing 100 % oxygen. Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), end-tidal carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation of haemoglobin and indirect arterial blood pressure via Doppler (DAP) were recorded every 5 mins. Thirty-four cats (10 males and 24 females), between the age of 6 and 18 months, and weighing between 1. 8 and 5. 3 kg, and undergoing neutering procedures were included in this study. The results are presented as <b>median</b> (<b>min,</b> <b>max)</b> values. The time to first spontaneous movement (TS) was > 30 mins in 19 cats, of which 12 received atipamezole for reversal {{of the effects of}} medetomidine. The TS was 53 (43, 130) mins in these 12 cats and 50 (40, 72) mins in the other seven cats. The body temperature in those 19 cats was significantly lower than the other cats (P = 0. 05). The alfaxalone induction dose and maintenance infusion rate were 1. 7 (0. 7, 3. 0) mg/kg and 0. 18 (0. 06, 0. 25) mg/kg/min, respectively. The HR, RR and DAP were 145 (68, 235) beats/min, 17 (5, 40) breaths/min and 110 (58, 210) mmHg, respectively. Apnoea was not observed in any cat. In conclusion, alfaxalone TIVA in combination with medetomidine and morphine premedication was effective in feral and domestic cats for the performance of neutering surgery; low body temperature might have resulted in longer recoveries in some cats...|$|R

Since, the effect of short duration muscle activation associated with dynamic activities {{is yet to be}} established, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of incidental walking activity on Achilles tendon diametral strain. Eleven healthy male participants refrained from physical activity in excess of the walking required to carry out necessary daily tasks and wore an activity monitor during the 24 h study period. Achilles tendon diametral strain, 2 cm proximal to the calcaneal insertion, was determined from sagittal sonograms. Baseline sonographic examinations were conducted at â¼ 08 : 00 h followed by replicate examinations at 12 and 24 h. Walking activity was measured as either present (1) or absent (0) and a linear weighting function was applied to account for the proximity of walking activity to tendon examination time.

Furthermore, congener composition in feline serum samples was dominated by congener BDE- 99, followed by BDE- 47 then BDE- 153 which differs from results of human biomonitoring. There was no correlation between PBDE levels in feline serum samples and matched house dust samples (n= 25).

Protein fractions were separated using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted against: mucin 5 b, albumin, carbonic anhydrase VI (CA VI) and statherin antibodies. Amounts were quantified using ImageLab software against purified protein standards of known concentration. ANOVA followed by paired t-test and Wilcoxon's matched-pair signed-rank test were used to test statistical significance. The difference {{was considered to be}} significant at a P value < 0. 05. The total protein on eroded surfaces was significantly lower compared to the total protein on non-eroded surfaces [0. 41 mg/mL (0. 04) and 0. 61 mg/mL (0. 11) ] respectively (p< 0. 05). The <b>median</b> (<b>min,</b> <b>max)</b> amount of statherin was also significantly lower on eroded occlusal surfaces [84. 1 (20. 0, 221. 8) ng] compared to AEP from non-eroded teeth in the same subjects [97. 1 (30. 0, 755. 6) ng] (p = 0. 002). No statistical differences were observed for mucin 5 b, albumin or CA VI. The total protein and statherin in the in-vivo AEP were different between eroded and non-eroded tooth surfaces of the same patient...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{a variety}} of fixed and trained fusion rules are {{compared}} {{in the context of}} face authentication. Five fixed fusion rules (sum, <b>min,</b> <b>max,</b> <b>median,</b> and product) and two trained rules (the support vector machines and weighted averaging of scores) are considered. It is shown that a better performance is obtained by fusing the classifiers. Moreover, the adopted trained rules outperform the fixed rule. Although, the PCA-based classifiers perform nearly 3 times worse than the LDA-based one, an interesting finding of this paper compared to our previous work [19] is that the performance of the verification system can be further improved by fusing the LDA- and PCA-based classifiers. In [20], a similar study has been performed using Euclidean distance as the scoring function. In the training stage of the proposed algorithm, adopting a fixed reference as the central value of the decision making threshold, client specific weights are determined by calculating the average value of the Euclidean distance of all the patterns from each client template. The client specific weights are determined in both LDA and PCA spaces. The weights are then used within the framework of three simple untrained fusion rules. In the adopted experimental protocol, each subject images are divided into two parts as the training and test sets. The experimental study performed on the ORL and Yale data sets demonstrate that the combined classifier outperforms the individual PCA- and LDA-based classifiers [20]. Although the training and test images are different, since the same subjects are available within the training and test sets, the weighting process is somehow biased so that the performance of the system in the presence of new impostors (not those used for training) could be worse.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Daptomycin is {{a rapidly}} {{bactericidal}} agent with broad coverage against Gram-positive organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, {{the most frequent}} cause of osteomyelitis. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe the clinical outcome of patients with non-hardware associated osteomyelitis, and the safety profile of daptomycin in the treatment of these infections. Methods All patients with osteomyelitis, excluding concurrent orthopedic foreign body infections, treated with daptomycin and identified between 2007 â 2008 in a retrospective, multicenter, observational registry, were included. Investigators assessed patient outcome (cured, improved, failed, non-evaluable) at the end of daptomycin therapy. Patients with a successful outcome at the end of daptomycin therapy were reassessed in 2009. All patients were included in the safety analysis; evaluable patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Data was assessed using descriptive statistics. A Kaplan Meier analysis was used to assess time to clinical failure. Results Two-hundred and nine osteomyelitis patients successfully completed daptomycin therapy in 2007 â 2008, 71 of which (34 %) had a follow-up visit in 2009 and had an evaluable clinical outcome. The <b>median</b> (<b>min,</b> <b>max)</b> daptomycin dose and duration were 6 [*]mg/kg (4, 10) and 42 [*]days (1, 88), respectively. Of the 52 patients with a documented pathogen, S. aureus was the most common (42 %); primarily methicillin-resistant S. aureus. All patients were included in the safety analysis; evaluable patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Clinical resolution was reported in 94 % (CI - 86. 2 %, 98. 44 %) of patients. A Kaplan Meier analysis of time to clinical failure showed that approximately 85 % (CI â 64 %, 95 %) of patients had a continued successful outcome at the time of re-evaluation. Eighteen patients (25 %) in the safety population experienced an adverse event; 13 patients (18 %) had an adverse event that was possibly-related to daptomycin treatment. Conclusions Daptomycin appears to be an effective therapeutic choice with an acceptable safety profile in the management of osteomyelitis that does not involve hardware. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Medical coma is an anesthetic-induced {{state of}} brain inactivation, {{manifest}} in the electroencephalogram by burst suppression. Feedback control {{can be used to}} regulate burst suppression, however, previous designs have not been robust. Robust control design is critical under real-world operating conditions, subject to substantial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameter uncertainty and unpredictable external disturbances. We sought to develop a robust closed-loop anesthesia delivery (CLAD) system to control medical coma. Approach. We developed a robust CLAD system to control the burst suppression probability (BSP). We developed a novel BSP tracking algorithm based on realistic models of propofol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We also developed a practical method for estimating patient-specific pharmacodynamics parameters. Finally, we synthesized a robust proportional integral controller. Using a factorial design spanning patient age, mass, height, and gender, we tested whether the system performed within clinically acceptable limits. Throughout all experiments we subjected the system to disturbances, simulating treatment of refractory status epilepticus in a real-world intensive care unit environment. Main results. In 5400 simulations, CLAD behavior remained within specifications. Transient behavior after a step in target BSP from 0. 2 to 0. 8 exhibited a rise time (the <b>median</b> (<b>min,</b> <b>max))</b> of 1. 4 [1. 1, 1. 9] min; settling time, 7. 8 [4. 2, 9. 0] min; and percent overshoot of 9. 6 [2. 3, 10. 8]%. Under steady state conditions the CLAD system exhibited a median error of 0. 1 [â 0. 5, 0. 9]%; inaccuracy of 1. 8 [0. 9, 3. 4]%; oscillation index of 1. 8 [0. 9, 3. 4]%; and maximum instantaneous propofol dose of 4. 3 [2. 1, 10. 5] mg kg[superscript â 1]. The maximum hourly propofol dose was 4. 3 [2. 1, 10. 3] mg kg[superscript â 1] h[superscript â 1]. Performance fell within clinically acceptable limits for all measures. Significance. A CLAD system designed using robust control theory achieves clinically acceptable performance in the presence of realistic unmodeled disturbances and in spite of realistic model uncertainty, while maintaining infusion rates within acceptable safety limits...|$|R
40|$|Background: Repair of {{congenital}} groin hernia/hydrocele is {{the most}} common surgical procedure performed by paediatric surgeons. There is dearth of literature comparing the outcomes of open herniotomy in children using various surgical approaches. This study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy of open herniotomy by comparing external ring incision, hernial sac twisting and whether or not double ligation has benefit over a single suture application. Materials and Methods: A multi-centre prospective randomised clinical trial was conducted with a total of 428 patients having congenital inguinal hernia and/or hydrocele. Patients were randomly assigned into four groups: RO (had external ring opened, hernial sac twisted and doubly ligated), ST (had hernial sac twisted and doubly ligated without opening the ring), DL (had double ligation of hernial sac without ring opening nor twisted) while SL (had single ligation of hernial sac with neither ring opening nor sac twisting). Results: A total of 458 repairs were done. Patientsâ² age ranged from 0. 25 years (3 months) to 21 years in group RO with mean of 4. 87 Ã 4. 07 (median, 4), 0. 069 years (24 days) to 17 years in group ST with mean of 4. 23 Ã 4. 03 (median, 3), 0. 5 years (6 months) to 16 years in group DL with mean of 4. 59 Ã 3. 87 (median, 4) and 1 year to 19 years in group SL with mean of 5. 00 Ã 4. 19 (median, 4). Operation time per repair was 26. 50 Ã 5. 46 min, range 16 - 40 <b>min</b> (<b>median,</b> 27 <b>min)</b> in group RO, 22. 18 Ã 5. 34 min, range 12 - 39 <b>min</b> (<b>median,</b> 21 <b>min)</b> in group ST while 17. 98 Ã 3. 40 min with range of 12 - 39 <b>min</b> (<b>median,</b> 17 <b>min)</b> in group DL and 15. 27 Ã 4. 18 min, range 7 - 40 <b>min</b> (<b>median,</b> 15 <b>min)</b> in group SL P < 0. 0001.

40|$|Telepathology (TP) {{is defined}} as {{delivering}} pathology services over a distance 1. TP frozen section service is in routine use for more than 20 years, mainly in countries with areas of low population density, such as USA 2, Canada 3, Norway 4 and Japan 5. Telepathology frozen-section-service is using a robotic microscope with an attached digital camera to intraoperatively render time-critical diagnosis 4, 7. Diagnostic accuracy in telepathology frozen section examining different tissues is between 90 - 98 % 3, 8 - 12. It takes more time to render a diagnosis compared to conventional microscopy 11, 25. Virtual microscopy is an emerging alternative technology already in routine use 3, 14 - 16. In telepathology frozen-section the preparation of gross specimen prior to kryostaining is performed by a non-pathologist 15, 17 under supervision by the telepathologist via videoconference. The professional association of German pathologists sees this {{as a violation of}} specialty boundaries and deployed a restraining order against TP frozen section services in Germany 21. There is limited data {{about the quality of the}} macroscopic part of frozen section, since the mainly retrospective studies are limited on telemicroscopy 18 - 20, 26. More prospective comparing studies were demanded 22. Methods In our prospective randomized trial comparing conventional and telepathological frozen section service in oncological breast surgery we used the dynamic robotic TP-System TPS 1 (Leica Microsystems GmbH Wetzlar) 24. The gross preparation was executed by the surgeon supervised by the telepathologist using a videomacroscope. We randomized 84 cases in seven month. In the TP arm three cases had to be excluded, two due to technical failure and one for meeting the exclusion criteria. Finally 81 cases were included, 46 in the conventional and 35 in the telepathological arm. Results Diagnostic accuracy was slightly lower in the telepathological arm (91, 4 % vs. 95, 7 %). In each of the study arms two cases were deferred. Telepathologically there was one false-positive diagnosis âSuspicious for DCISâ, with the same diagnosis rendered conventionally. The turnaround time was higher in Telepathology (TP: 4 bis 38, 5 <b>min.,</b> <b>Median</b> 17 <b>min.,</b> Standardabweichung 8, 3 min.; conventional: 2, 5 bis 27 <b>min.,</b> <b>median.</b> 9 <b>min,</b> standard deviation 5, 7 min.), also the time for microscopy (TP: 1 bis 27, 5 <b>min.,</b> <b>median</b> 6 <b>min.,</b> standard deviation 7 min.; conventional: 0, 5 bis 18 <b>min.,</b> <b>median</b> 5 <b>min.,</b> standard deviation 3, 7 min.). The gross preparation performed by the surgeon was time-effective and there was no sampling error. Conclusions Frozen section service can be done using telepathology time sufficiently and in good diagnostic quality. Due to changes in public health system a wider use can be expected...|$|R

40|$|Context. Helicopter darting (chemical immobilisation) is a {{very useful}} {{technique}} for large wild herbivores, such as feral horses (Equus caballus). There is currently no reliable framework {{to report on the}} animal welfare impacts of helicopter darting methods. Aim. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an animal welfare assessment framework for helicopter darting methods, using quantifiable parameters, and to test it with a case study using a newly developed feral horse capture technique. Methods. Quantifiable animal welfare parameters were recorded for 11 feral horses captured using a traditional helicopter darting method in north-Western Australia in October 2014. Welfare parameters chosen focused on quantifying the duration of procedures and the frequency of adverse events. They included chase time (CT; min) before darting, induction time (IT; min) between darting and recumbency, recumbency time (RT; min), total time (TT; CT+IT+RT; min), repeat-darting rate (animals requiring > 1 dart; %), target zone accuracy rate (darts striking the intended anatomical area; %) and mortality rate (at time of capture and 14 days post-capture; %). Results. Median CT was 2 <b>min,</b> <b>median</b> IT was 19 <b>min,</b> <b>median</b> RT was 16 <b>min</b> and <b>median</b> TT was 38 min. Repeat-darting rate was 45 %, target zone accuracy rate was 53 % and mortality rates (time of capture and 14 days post-capture) were zero. Conclusions. Animal welfare parameters can be quantified for helicopter darting through estimation of the duration of procedures and the frequency of adverse events. Use of this framework will allow the identification of parameters requiring refinement for newly developed helicopter darting techniques. Implications. Animal welfare parameters are particularly important for helicopter-based darting methods. Pilot studies, using quantified parameters, should be performed for newly developed capture techniques before they are approved for large-scale programs...|$|R
