40|$|The {{technique}} of alkali fusion reaction gas chromatography {{has been applied}} to the analysis and characterization of polycyanoalkylsiloxanes, polyalkoxysiloxanes, and poly-m-carboranylsiloxanes. ^ A reaction system was designed to allow the efficient and quantitative conversion of the organo-functional and silicon-functional groups to products sufficiently volatile for gas chromatographic analysis. Milligram or less quantities of material were reacted at elevated temperatures in a flowing inert atmosphere for periods of 15 minutes or less. Upon completion of the reaction, the cryogenically trapped fusion products were flash volatilized onto the gas chromatograph column for separation and quantitation. A mini volume switching valve allowed the simultaneous occurrence of polymer fusion and product chromatography of a previous fusion. The average percent relative standard deviation was 1. 2 %. ^ The thermal degradation properties of the poly-m-carboranylsiloxanes were studied by pyrolysis gas chromatography encompassing the ancillary techniques of <b>selective</b> <b>element</b> detection and mass spectroscopy. A gas chromatograph was interfaced with an atmospheric pressure microwave induced and sustained plasma emission detector for boron pyrolyzate analysis and an atmospheric pressure d. c. argon plasma emission echelle spectrometer for silicon pyrolyzate analysis. The <b>use</b> of <b>selective</b> <b>element</b> detection simplified the interpretation of the complex pyrograms and facilitated the mass spectral determination of the pyrolyzate structures. ^ The thermal degradation of the poly-m-carboranylsiloxanes cannot proceed through an intramolecular cyclization pathway due to the steric restraints imposed by the presence of the carborane cage in the siloxane backbone. It was postulated that the m-carboranylsiloxanes depolymerize by an intermolecular pathway; the presence of cyclic siloxane pyrolyzates was shown to be consistent with this pathway. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the methods and}} processes of generating tunable single wavelength and dual-wavelength fiber lasers by using {{two different types of}} gain media. They are erbium doped fiber (EDF) and semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) with each of them working as near to homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening transition gain media respectively. Various single wavelength and dual-wavelength fiber lasers (DWFLs) designs <b>using</b> different <b>selective</b> <b>elements</b> namely tunable banpass filter (TBF), compression and tensile strain FBGs (CTS-FBGs) and arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) are also discussed and compared in the thesis in terms of their output power, side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) and tunability. To generate single wavelength fiber lasers is not a problem compared to the generation of dual-wavelength fiber laser in a homogeneous gain medium. Therefore, cavity loss control method, as a new and novel approach is proposed to overcome the mode competition issue faced by EDF for generation of balanced dual-wavelength output. The generation of DWFL by using SOA is also presented in the thesis which is free from mode competition issue, which however fairs badly in terms of output power performance. This is presented as an alternative way of generating the DWFL. The DWFLs have a lot of applications in various fields including fiber sensors and communications. In this study, new designs of DWFLs for various applications are presented. They are the generation of single longitudinal mode fiber laser for potential application in iii Terahertz ray, the generation of DWFL for wavelength conversion, the generation of DWFL for a minute shifts temperature sensor and also the generation of DWFL for microwaves generation.

40|$|The {{development}} of a source of picosecond optical pulses {{is of paramount importance}} for an increasing number of photonic applications, such as optical time division multiplexing (OTDM) or hybrid wavelength division multiplexing/OTDM systems [1]. One of the simplest and most reliable techniques of generating picosecond optical pulses involves gain-switching a Fabry-Perot (FP) semiconductor laser [2]. Gain-switching of FP lasers, as opposed to DFB lasers, is more attractive since these lasers are more cost efficient and they yield pulses with lower jitter [3]. However, a problem associated with employing FP lasers in such a gain-switched configuration is the multi-moded output that would lead to the pulses suffering from a large amount of dispersion when transmitted through standard single mode fibre (SSMF). External injection or self-seeding at an appropriate wavelength, into the gain-switched FP laser is a simple solution {{that could be used to}} achieve single moded pulse generation. By varying the injected wavelength to select out different modes, the FP laser could potentially be used as a source of wavelength tunable pulses [4]. Other advantages that light injection brings are an improvement in the pulse temporal jitter and a reduction in chirp. Self-seeding of gain-switched lasers is a simple technique since it negates the need for an additional CW source by <b>using</b> a wavelength <b>selective</b> <b>element</b> placed in an external cavity. A small fraction of the output light, at a chosen wavelength, is re-injected into the gain-switched laser. However, to ensure optimum operatio...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSpintronic devices {{currently}} rely on magnetization {{control by}} external magnetic fields or spin-polarized currents. Developing temperature-driven magnetization control has potential for achieving enhanced device functionalities. Recently, {{there has been}} much interest in thermally induced magnetisation switching (TIMS), where the temperature control of intrinsic material properties drives a deterministic switching without applying external fields. TIMS, mainly investigated in rare-earth–transition-metal ferrimagnets, has also been observed in epitaxial Fe/MnAs/GaAs(001), where it stems from a completely different physical mechanism. In Fe/MnAs temperature actually modifies the surface dipolar fields associated with the MnAs magnetic microstructure. This in turn determines the effective magnetic field acting on the Fe overlayer. In this way one can reverse the Fe magnetization direction by performing thermal cycles at ambient temperatures. Here we <b>use</b> <b>element</b> <b>selective</b> magnetization measurements to demonstrate that various magnetic configurations of the Fe/MnAs/GaAs(001) system are stabilized predictably by acting on the thermal cycle parameters and on the presence of a bias field.
