40|$|Temporal {{planning}} contains {{aspects of}} both planning and scheduling. Many temporal planners assume a loose coupling {{between these two}} sub-problems {{in the form of}} "blackbox" durative actions, where the state of the world is not known during the action's execution. This reduces the size of the search space and so simplifies the temporal planning problem, restricting what can be modelled. In particular, the simplification makes it impossible to <b>model</b> <b>co-ordination,</b> where actions must be executed concurrently to achieve a desired effect. Coordination results from logical and temporal constraints that must both be met, and for this reason, the planner and scheduler must communicate in order to find a valid temporal plan. This communication effectively increases the size of the search space, so must be done intelligently and as little as possible to limit this increase. This thesis contributes a comprehensive analysis of where temporal constraints appear in temporal planning problems. It introduces the notions of minimum and maximum temporal constraints, and with these isolates where the planning and scheduling are coupled together tightly, in the form of co-ordination, it characterises this with the new concepts of envelopes and contents. A new temporal planner written, called СRIKЕҮ, uses this theory to solve temporal problems involving co-ordination that other planners are unable to solve. However, it does this intelligently, using this theory to minimise the communication between the sub-solvers, and so does not expand the search space unnecessarily. The novel search space that CRIKEY uses docs not specify the timings of future events and this allows for the handling of duration inequalities, which again, few other temporal planners are able to solve. Results presented show СRIKЕҮ to be a competitive planner, whilst not making the same simplifying assumptions that other temporal planners make as to the nature of temporal planning problems...|$|E

40|$|Incentive {{scheme and}} {{co-ordination}} policy are substantial components for the co-ordination of a decentralized supply chain system, {{but there is}} little work combining the two components as a single decision model (Li and Wang, 2007). This paper proposes a model which incorporates both incentive and co-ordination issues into a single <b>co-ordination</b> <b>model</b> for a single-vendor multi-buyer supply chain. In the proposed <b>model,</b> the <b>co-ordination</b> is achieved by synchronizing ordering and production cycles while price discount, which is based on the buyers' order intervals, is used as the incentive to motivate buyers to participate in the co-ordination. While the vendor is benefited from the co-ordination by synchronized cycles, the proposed price discount scheme can guarantee that a buyer's total relevant cost of co-ordination will be reduced when compared with independent optimization. More importantly, the proposed price discount scheme does not require any cost information from the buyers. Department of Applied Mathematic...|$|R

Several more countries will probably join them in the near future, for example Finland, Sweden and Spain. The objectives are twofold: to increase efficiency and to contribute both locally and globally to environmental improvement. Even larger regions like the European Union, plan to deregulate their internal electricity markets. For the EU this implies introduction of third party access to the transmission grid within and between the Union member countries. In this context, the Scandinavian push towards deregulation is an interesting experiment. We discuss the consequences of an international deregulation of electricity markets on the basis from simulations on an empirical energy market model for the Nordic countries. Deregulation may have severe effects on the location of new power plants within the Nordic area and implies a large impact on the income distribution both among countries and between electricity producers and consumers.

40|$|In South Africa, {{more than}} 65 % of commuters use public {{transport}} every day. However, the public transport system which commonly {{takes the form}} of a trunk-feeder network is not structured to meet the needs of the different users. Taxis which are informal serve as feeders to an interchange while the trunk services depart the interchange in a scheduled formal manner. Because of this difference in the nature in which the two public transport services operate, it renders the intermodal system uncoordinated. It thus makes it difficult for transport planners to coordinate unscheduled feeder services to the scheduled trunk services. This study investigated how the feeder public transport service configurations and operations on trunk bus services can be integrated and coordinated. The research employed an agent-based simulation tool to model and simulate trunk-feeder operations and further investigate how the configuration and operational characteristics of the trunk-feeder public transport system impact the passenger travel performance. The modelled intermodal operations mimicked typical trunk-feeder operations as follows: passenger arrival at stops to wait for taxis; passengers boarding and alighting along the feeder route; transferring passengers alighting from taxis; and walking through the interchange to connect to their respective trunk services so as to reach their destinations. The output of the validated base simulation model i. e. system characteristics, configurations and parameters were utilized to determine the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) in the system. The analysis of the KPIs showed that there is indeed no co-ordination between feeder arrivals and trunk departures, and that this is mostly a result of inefficiencies in current operations in the feeder system. Scenarios were then developed to improve the trunk-feeder model where they focused on improving the efficiency of taxi feeder operations along the feeder route, as well as integrating and co-ordinating the feeder services to the trunk services. The results of the model analysis showed that integration of trunk and feeder services can be achieved through timed transfers; whereby taxi arrivals at the interchange are co-ordinated to bus departures from the interchange. This must of course be supplemented with other improvements tested in the scenarios on the feeder network. However, the operational behaviour of taxi feeder services is not predictable as a result of route non-compliance. This makes it difficult to plan timed transfers between them and formal bus and train services in order to achieve integration. It is therefore key that the transport authority and the taxi association's work closely to ensure that the regulations set about taxi operations and route compliance are followed. Without monitoring, the taxis will tend to operate in areas with high demand as operators are profit seeking as opposed to servicing the community and this will limit the success of this objective.

The article uses the games theory and methods of system analysis for modelling these processes.

The main difficulty of modelling the investment activity in major financial and production groups lies in the necessity to take into account interconnection between individual participants of the investment process and co-ordination of their interests and actions. The proposed approaches to analysis and selection of investment projects inside a major financial and industrial group facilitates making a co-ordination decision on distribution of investment resources of the general system fund and funds of individual system subdivisions.

Soybean production is expanding into cooler and warmer environments, thus, it becomes critical to expand the current knowledge about the influence of temperature on soybean. Temperature is the main environmental factor effecting node appearance rate (NAR) and node initiation rate (NIR), which are key parameters controlling soybean growth and development. This study aims to assess the response of NAR and NIR to temperature and investigate the coordination between these two processes under controlled and field conditions. Two greenhouse experiments with four contrasting mean temperatures (15 - 26 ºC) and two field experiments with different sowing dates (April 23 to June 19) were conducted using maturity groups 2. 1 and 3. 0. The number of appeared nodes was measured every 2 to 7 days from sowing to ca. R 5 to estimate NAR (nodes d- 1). Stem apex was dissected every 4 to 7 days from sowing to ca. R 3 to estimate NIR (nodes d- 1). A <b>co-ordination</b> <b>model</b> was fitted between the number of initiated nodes and number of appeared nodes.

There is a strong two-phase co-ordination between node initiation and node appearance.

40|$|International Symposium on Neural Control of Space Coding and Action Production, LYON, FRANCE, 2001 International audienceThis {{chapter is}} divided into three main parts. Firstly, on the basis of the, literature, we will shortly discuss how the recent {{introduction}} of the concept of internal models by Daniel Wolpert and Mitsuo Kawato contributes {{to a better understanding of}} what is motor learning and what is motor adaptation. Then, we will present a <b>model</b> of eye-hand <b>co-ordination</b> during self-moved target tracking, which we used as a way to specifically address these topics. Finally, we will show some evidence about the use of proprioceptive information for updating the internal models, in the context of eye-hand co-ordination. Motor and afferent information appears to contribute to the parametric adjustment (adaptation) between arm motor command and visual information about arm motion. The study reported here was aimed at assessing the contribution of arm proprioception in building (learning) and updating (adaptation) these representations. The subjects (including a deafferented subject) had to make back and forth movements with their forearm in the horizontal plane, over teamed amplitude and at constant frequency, and to track an arm-driven target with their eyes. The dynamical conditions of arm movement were altered (unexpectedly or systematically) during the movement by changing the mechanical properties of the manipulandum. The results showed a significant change of the latency and the gain of the smooth pursuit system, before and after the perturbation for the control subjects, but not for the deafferented subject. Moreover, in control subjects, vibrations of the arm muscles prevented adaptation to the mechanical perturbation. These results suggest that in a self-moved target tracking task, the arm motor system shares with the smooth pursuit system an internal representation of the arm dynamical properties, and that arm proprioception is necessary to build this internal model. As suggested by Ghez et al. (1990) (Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol., 55 : 837 - 8471), proprioception would allow control subjects to learn the inertial properties of the limb...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the {{determinants}} that trigger Norwegian firms to offshore and to examine how firms and industries choose to organize their vertical activities; through in-house offshoring or outsourcing. The determinants that trigger the Norwegian firms to offshore production may be examined by analysing the cost trade-off associated with splitting production activities by function. Surveying the determinants for offshoring in the Norwegian industry is important for understanding the increasing verticality in trade, {{and it can be}} a starting point of an analysis of the consequences offshoring will have for the Norwegian economy. The forces of globalization are believed to have changed the nature of trade, leading to an increasing interconnectedness of production processes where countries specialize in stages of production and vertical trading chains are created across boundaries. Globalization reflects the many technological and organizational developments that have made it easier to carry out international transactions. Furthermore the opening of the markets in China, India and Eastern Europe give access to different factor endowments, technologies and to a huge pool of non-agricultural labour. Technological advance in logistic processes which improve timeliness and reduce time- and co-ordination costs, in addition to the diffusion of information technologies, has improved the utilization of these markets. Fragmentation of production processes allows for a more specialized use of factors in production. Specialized production blocks can be relocated to countries which are relatively abundant in the factor that is used relatively more of in the production process. This enables a lower marginal cost of production. The relocation of production processes has its costs in terms of increased trade and transportation costs, but also due to an increased need to co-ordinate intermediate goods that requires timeliness and efficient transportation. In addition, frictions in market due to imperfect information may increase the costs of finding a partner to form a relationship with, the costs of (re-) negotiating contracts, and the hold-up problem leads to insufficient investments. This trade-off is important for gaining insight into the determinants that trigger Norwegian firms to offshore production. I will use variants of standard trade theories, such as Ricardian model of trade and Heckscher-Ohlin to explain how benefits arises form differences in technology and factor endowments. The costs of disintegration will be examined by reviewing Jones and Kierzkowski’s (2000) <b>model</b> of <b>co-ordination</b> costs and transaction costs. The organizational form is chosen to reduce the transaction costs, and the boundaries of the firm are assumed to be determined where the costs of using the market to allocate resources are the same as the costs of keeping the activities internal in a firm. I will use Dunning’s OLI framework and asset specificity theories to gain insight into the choice of organizational form. I have used data from a survey conducted by TBL which examines the offshoring activity among the companies in the Norwegian technology industry. These data are combined with financial data from the Dun & Bradstreet database. The calculations have been conducted by the use of SPSS 14. 0 and Microsoft Office Excel. The findings, using descriptive analysis, support that the main reason for firms to offshore is to save costs. As the costs of unskilled labour in Norway are relatively high, many firms relocate their activity to countries abundant in labour such as China and countries in Eastern Europe. These areas represent also emerging economies, where Norwegian firms see a potential market for their products. Some firms report this as a reason for their offshoring activity, but often in combination with the desire of saving costs. Transaction costs are assumed to be increasing relative to the size if the firms are small. The analysis shows that large firms do have a high share of offshoring, but so do the smaller firms in our sample. Also the geographical relocation cost is assumed to be higher with distance, and as smaller firms have relatively smaller volume in their transactions than larger corporations we may expect that the fixed costs of offshoring are relatively high for a small firm. Surprisingly, the smaller firms in our sample have high shares of offshoring to Asian countries. Theory predicts that the choice of organizational form depends on the transaction costs that a specific firm or industry faces, and that the relative ability to undertake different organizational forms depend on a firm’s productivity. Most of the firms in our sample use the market to allocate resources, and consistent with theory, these firms are less capital intensive and have less productivity than firms that choose to use in-house offshoring...|$|R
