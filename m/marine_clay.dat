25|$|By far the {{two most}} widely spoken West Frisian dialects are Clay Frisian (Klaaifrysk) and Wood Frisian (Wâldfrysk). Both these names are derived from the Frisian landscape. In the western and {{north-western}} parts of the province, the region where Clay Frisian is spoken, the soil {{is made up of}} thick <b>marine</b> <b>clay,</b> hence the name. While in the Clay Frisian-speaking area ditches are used to separate the pastures, {{in the eastern part of}} the province, where the soil is sandy, and water sinks away much faster, rows of trees are used to that purpose. The dialect spoken in the eastern area is thus called Wood Frisian.|$|E

Green spherical materials and remnants of dead microbial cells of filamentous bacteria are abundant in the green <b>marine</b> <b>clays.</b> Organic carbon and graphite {{were found in the}} volcanic sandstone. Transmission electron microscope observations clearly show processes of graphite mineralization from low-crystallinity to well-crystallized graphite. However, X-ray photoelectron spectrochemical analyses (micro-ESCA) indicate that the green <b>marine</b> <b>clays</b> contain high C (1 s) of microbial origin carbon, and COO, C [...] -O, C [...] -C and graphite structures. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR spectra) of the green spherules show peaks between glauconite and celadonite. X-ray powder diffraction data show the presence of smectite and 1. 03 - 1. 22 -nm mica-clay minerals with abundant zeolites, which are hydrothermal alteration products. The results suggest that fossil remnants of graphite mineralized organisms, in particular filamentous bacteria, might {{play an important role in}} the formation of green <b>marine</b> <b>clays...</b>|$|R
500|$|The Somerset Levels (or Somerset Levels and Moors as {{they are}} less {{commonly}} but more correctly known) are a sparsely populated wetland area of central Somerset, between the Quantock and Mendip hills.

The project area accounts for almost half of the Somerset Levels and Moors Special Protection Area. The area includes land already managed for conservation by organisations including Somerset Wildlife Trust, Natural England, the Hawk and Owl Trust and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. These include Shapwick Heath national nature reserve, Westhay Moor, Catcott Lows National Nature Reserve, Ham Wall and Shapwick Moor. There are 25 scheduled monuments and 746 Historic Environment Records in the project area including internationally important sites such at the Glastonbury Lake Village and Sweet Track.

500|$|In prehistoric {{times the}} {{coastline}} of Somerset {{was very different}} from the present one, the sea level at the last glacial maximum being several hundred feet lower than today so that the Bristol Channel was almost non-existent. The Bristol Channel has one of the largest tidal ranges in the world, up to [...] at Burnham-on-Sea for example, behind only the Bay of Fundy and Ungava Bay in Canada. Normal high tide may be enhanced by between [...] and [...] during storm surges. This feature has meant that large areas of the county have been liable to flooding by the sea. Thus the present coastline is partly due a belt of <b>marine</b> <b>clay</b> at the coast and partly due to seawalls built to reclaim areas previously flooded at high tide. The coastline contains exposures of Devonian sediments and tectonics west of Minehead adjoining the classic exposures of Mesozoic sediments and structural features which extend eastward to the Parrett estuary forming cliffs along the coastline near Clevedon and near Minehead, with low sandhills near Burnham-on-Sea. There are sandy beaches mainly at Burnham-on-Sea, Brean and Weston-super-Mare. There are also storm ridges, salt marsh, and sand dunes.|$|E

2500|$|Then deep seas, Gault Clay and the Upper Greensand {{deposits}} {{form the}} deep soil, more evident where erosion {{has taken place}} on steeper hillslopes in the civil parish. The Gault Clay contains phosphate-rich nodules in discrete bands and has a rich marine fauna with abundant ammonites, bivalves and gastropods. The Upper Greensand comprises a variety of sediments with fine silts at the base giving way upwards into sandstones. Just before the paleogene which included the mass-extinction event of the non-avian dinosaurs sea levels dropped, exposing Sussex and Kent, marine Upnor Beds were deposited in Surrey. In the paleogene, Southern England slightly rose and the seas retreated and reddish and mottled clays of the Reading Beds were deposited by a large river sand delta system including {{across much of the}} Weald (which covers much of Sussex and Kent as well). [...] Later, a rise in sea level, around 50 million years ago caused widespread deposition, until 2 million years ago, of the London Clay across the county. The London Clay is a bluish-grey <b>marine</b> <b>clay</b> with isolated pockets of fossils especially where chalkier. The youngest part of the London Clay is known as the Claygate Beds and sand and soft sandstone of the Bagshot Formation, though in many areas such as this generally eroded, followed in most cases by a variable thickness of organic humus.|$|E

60|$|We {{may turn}} to geology to find how long mankind has lived on this continent. In {{a number of}} places in North and South America are found traces of human beings and their work so old that in {{comparison}} {{the beginning of the}} world's written history becomes a thing of yesterday. Perhaps there were men in Canada long before the shores of its lakes had assumed their present form; long before nature had begun to hollow out the great gorge of the Niagara river or to lay down the outline of the present Lake Ontario. Let us {{look at some of the}} notable evidence in respect to the age of man in America. In Nicaragua, in Central America, the imprints of human feet have been found, deeply buried over twenty feet below the present surface of the soil, under repeated deposits of volcanic rock. These impressions must have been made in soft muddy soil which was then covered by some geological convulsion occurring long ages ago. Even more striking discoveries have been made along the Pacific coast of South America. Near the mouth of the Esmeraldas river in Ecuador, over a stretch of some sixty miles, the surface soil of the coast covers a bed of <b>marine</b> <b>clay.</b> This clay is about eight feet thick. Underneath it is a stratum of sand and loam such as might once have itself been surface soil. In this lower bed there are found rude implements of stone, ornaments made of gold, and bits of broken pottery. Again, if we turn to the northern part of the continent we find remains of the same kind, chipped implements of stone and broken fragments of quartz buried in the drift of the Mississippi and Missouri valleys. These have sometimes been found lying beside or under the bones of elephants and animals unknown in North America since the period of the Great Ice. Not many years ago, some men engaged in digging a well on a hillside that was once part of the beach of Lake Ontario, came across the remains of a primitive hearth buried under the accumulated soil. From its situation we can only conclude that the men who set together the stones of the hearth, and lighted on it their fires, did so when the vast wall of the northern glacier was only beginning to retreat, and long before the gorge of Niagara had begun to be furrowed out of the rock.|$|E

5000|$|When clay is {{deposited}} in the ocean, the presence of excess ions in seawater causes a loose, open structure of the clay particles to form, {{a process known as}} flocculation.
