5|$|Martin Luther King Jr. was the {{conscience}} of his generation. He gazed upon {{the great wall of}} segregation and saw that the power of love could bring it down. From the pain and exhaustion of his fight to fulfill the promises of our founding fathers for our humblest citizens, he wrung his eloquent statement of his dream for America. He <b>made</b> <b>our</b> nation stronger because he made it better. His dream sustains us yet.|$|E
25|$|We, the {{descendants}} of the pioneer long hunters of the mountains, have been called Scotch-Irish and pure Anglo-Saxon, and that is complimentary, I reckon. But we want the world to know that we are Americans. The spiritual environment and our religious life in the mountains have <b>made</b> <b>our</b> spirit wholly American, and that true pioneer American spirit still exists in the Tennessee mountains.|$|E
25|$|You {{always told}} us to remain here {{and take care of}} our lands. It <b>made</b> <b>our</b> hearts glad to hear that was your wish... but now, father, we see you drawing back, and we are sorry to see our father doing so without seeing the enemy. We must compare our father's conduct to a fat animal, that carries its tail upon its back, but when affrighted, it drops it between its legs and runs off.|$|E

500|$|The {{season began}} airing in the United States on ABC on September 20, 2016, and {{completed}} its 22-episode run on May 16, 2017. Unlike {{the previous two}} seasons, which were split into [...] "two little mini-seasons" [...] based on their airing schedule, this season was broken into three different sections by the schedule. This led to the season's three pod story structure, which Tancharoen said [...] "has <b>made</b> <b>our</b> lives easier, to break it down in that way." ...|$|E
500|$|On 4 March the Japanese {{mounted a}} retaliatory {{raid on the}} Buna airfield, {{the site of a}} base that the Allies had {{captured}} back in January, though the fighters did little damage. Kenney wrote in his memoir that the Japanese reprisal occurred [...] "after the horse had been stolen from the barn. It was a good thing that the Nip air commander was stupid. Those hundred airplanes would have <b>made</b> <b>our</b> job awfully hard if they had taken part in the big fight over the convoy on March 3rd." ...|$|E
500|$|Lydon, in turn, would dismiss McLaren's influence: [...] "We <b>made</b> <b>our</b> own scandal just {{by being}} ourselves. Maybe {{it was that he}} knew he was redundant, so he overcompensated. All the talk about the French Situationists being {{associated}} with punk is bollocks. It's nonsense!" [...] Cook concurs: [...] "Situationism {{had nothing to do with}} us. The Jamie Reids and Malcolms were excited because we were the real thing. I suppose we were what they were dreaming of." [...] According to Lydon, [...] "If we had an aim, it was to force our own, working-class opinions into the mainstream, which was unheard of in pop music at the time." ...|$|E

500|$|Strasburg's {{high profile}} {{and the success}} of the Nationals in the 2012 season made the innings limit a topic of {{national}} conversation. In addition to baseball writers, a number of other figures made their views on the topic known, including football broadcasters Troy Aikman and Terry Bradshaw, basketball reporter Stephen A. Smith, and even prominent politicians such as Rudy Giuliani and Mitch McConnell. Rizzo [...] defended the decision to shut down Strasburg and criticized the buzz surrounding it: [...] "It's a good conversational piece, it's a good debatable subject. But most of the people that have weighed in on this know probably 10 percent of the information that we know, and that we've <b>made</b> <b>our</b> opinion based upon." ...|$|E
500|$|Along with The Dark Knight Returns, Tim Burton has {{mentioned}} that The Killing Joke influenced his film adaptation of Batman: [...] "I {{was never a}} giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan — and I think it started when I was a child — is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't {{know if it was}} dyslexia or whatever, but that's why I loved The Killing Joke, because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels <b>made</b> <b>our</b> ideas more acceptable." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{second and}} third seasons of the series were {{broadcast}} in two blocks each, with a season of Agent Carter airing in between. Bell explained that this decision was made following the challenge of producing 22 episodes for the first season to be aired over 36–40 weeks, which meant having repeats and [...] "losing momentum". Instead, Agent Carter took up much of that gap in a row, leaving the back half of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s season to run uninterrupted. This format allowed the producers and writers to approach each season in two parts, each with distinct stories connected by carried-over elements. Ahead of the fourth season, Tancharoen explained, [...] "For the past two seasons, we've been able to break our season down into two little mini-seasons because of the airdate schedule. This upcoming season, our airdate schedule is a little different, so we're breaking it into three pods. Story wise, the development of that has <b>made</b> <b>our</b> lives easier, to break it down in that way." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song that}} {{plays on the}} radio during the break in the Thanksgiving {{football}} game is [...] "Get Dancing" [...] by Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes. The game is played at the Pontiac Silverdome, then home to the Detroit Lions, who also play on Thanksgiving. Lisa says the following about her centerpiece: [...] "It's {{a tribute to the}} trailblazing women who <b>made</b> <b>our</b> country great. See, there's Georgia O'Keeffe, Susan B. Anthony, and this is Marjory Stoneman Douglas. I'm sure you haven't heard of her, but she worked her whole life to preserve the Florida Everglades." [...] The poem Lisa is seen writing in her room after her centerpiece is destroyed is a reference to Allen Ginsberg's poem [...] "Howl". Lisa also keeps a book of Ginsberg's work on a bookshelf next to Jack Kerouac's novel On the Road, and a collection of poems by Edgar Allan Poe. Feeling hungry, Bart decides to steal food from the old, rich Mr. Burns, who lives on the corner of Croesus and Mammon, two mythological figures of greed. A member of Burns' security staff reads the novel Les Misérables.|$|E
500|$|With {{his next}} album, the new decade found Morrison {{following}} his muse into uncharted territory and sometimes merciless reviews. In February 1980, Morrison {{and a group}} of musicians travelled to Super Bear, a studio in the French Alps, to record (on the site of a former abbey) what is considered to be the most controversial album in his discography; later [...] "Morrison admitted his original concept was even more esoteric than the final product." [...] The album, Common One, consisted of six songs; the longest, [...] "Summertime in England", lasted fifteen and one-half minutes and ended with the words,"Can you feel the silence?". NME magazine's Paul Du Noyer called the album [...] "colossally smug and cosmically dull; an interminable, vacuous and drearily egotistical stab at spirituality: Into the muzak." [...] Greil Marcus, whose previous writings had been favourably inclined towards Morrison, critically remarked: [...] "It's Van acting the part of the 'mystic poet' he thinks he's supposed to be." [...] Morrison insisted the album was never [...] "meant to be a commercial album." [...] Biographer Clinton Heylin concludes: [...] "He would not attempt anything so ambitious again. Henceforth every radical idea would be tempered by some notion of commerciality." [...] Later, critics reassessed the album more favourably with the success of [...] "Summertime in England". Lester Bangs wrote in 1982, [...] "Van was making holy music even though he thought he was, and us rock critics had <b>made</b> <b>our</b> usual mistake of paying too much attention to the lyrics." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} years of her career, Cyrus had a {{generally}} wholesome image as a teen idol. Her fame increased dramatically following the Vanity Fair photo scandal, and it was reported that photos of Cyrus could be shopped for $2,000 apiece. In the following years, Cyrus' image continued to shift dramatically, differing from her previous teen idol status. Donny Osmond wrote of Cyrus' transition into adulthood: [...] "Miley will have to face adulthood..... As she does, she'll want to change her image, and that change will be met with adversity." [...] The release of Can't Be Tamed (2010) saw Cyrus officially attempting to distance herself from her teenage years, releasing controversial music videos for her songs [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] (2010) and [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] (2010). Her behavior generated a considerable amount of controversy throughout 2013 and 2014, though godmother Dolly Parton stated [...] "...the girl can write. The girl can sing. The girl is smart. And she doesn't have to be so drastic. But I will respect her choices. I did it my way, so why can't she do it her way?" [...] Cyrus was placed at number seventeen on Forbes' list of the most powerful celebrities in 2014, with the magazine noting that [...] "The last time she <b>made</b> <b>our</b> list was when she was still rolling in Hannah Montana money. Now the pop singer is all grown up and courting controversy at every turn." [...] In August 2014, it was reported that Bluewater Productions has documented her life in a comic book called Fame: Miley Cyrus, starting with her controversial 2013 MTV Video Music Awards performance to her Disney fame, and exploring her childhood in Tennessee. The comic book was written by Michael L. Frizell and drawn by Juan Luis Rincón, and is available in both print and digital formats.|$|E

500|$|Rob Salem of Toronto Star {{said that}} [...] "fans {{who have been}} {{complaining}} about this season’s relative complacency [...] finally got their gore and more when the farm was overrun by suddenly, strangely single-minded walkers." [...] Pamela Mitchell of Houston Chronicle commented that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] was the most eventful episode of the season, while Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery thought that [...] "every single major character gets their moment to shine"; [...] "Epic, action-packed, emotional—'Beside the Dying Fire' is great television," [...] she concluded. TV Guide television critic Michael Logan affirmed that the season finale [...] "was so scary and shock-a-minute outrageous that it nearly <b>made</b> <b>our</b> heads explode." [...] In his A– review, Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club said that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] adequately accomplished what he was hoping for. He wrote, [...] "We're finally off Hershel's farm, in about the most definitive way imaginable: The barn has been burned, and the house itself is overrun by a herd of 'walkers'." [...] New York Starlee Kine adulated the installment, and asserted that it was comparable to episodes of The Walking Dead first season. [...] "It’s just amazing how much smoother the plot holes go down when something is actually happening on this show. For {{the first time since}} last season, I felt engrossed enough to not be consumed with all the small things this show gets wrong. Up until this episode, the majority of this season has consisted exclusively of small things: petty dramas, misdirected stakes, so much stalling. I’m not sure I can {{go so far as to}} say that it got everything right with this one, but at least it was entertaining and the nonstop action felt like content instead of just bookends." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program [...] "ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] sufficiently encompassed a climax for its storylines, adding that it left the audience anticipating for future installments of the series.|$|E
