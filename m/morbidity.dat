40|$|Background: Maternal <b>morbidities</b> are {{considered}} a leading contributor to the burden of disease among women. Especially, if postpartum <b>morbidities</b> are left untreated, this can cause {{a negative impact on}} the quality of life. The study was conducted to determine the proportion and types of postpartum <b>morbidities</b> among women visiting government health facilities in Udupi Taluk, Karnataka and to find out the association between the <b>morbidities</b> and various factors. Subjects and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in various government hospitals in Udupi Taluk, consisted of 229 postpartum women. These subjects were selected from mothers who accompanied their children for immunization from February 2013 to July 2013 using purposive sampling technique. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to find out the association between the <b>morbidities</b> and various factors using SPSS version 15. Results: Among 112 (48. 9 %) women who experienced postpartum <b>morbidities,</b> back pain (23. 6 %), and perineal pain (15. 7 %) were most commonly reported physical <b>morbidities.</b> Similarly, anxiety (10 %) and irritability (7. 9 %) were the most common psychological problems. Demographic factors such as religion 2. 4 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 1, 5. 4) and occupation 2. 5 (95 % CI 1. 1, 5. 9) were associated with the <b>morbidities.</b> Likewise, obstetric factors such as place of delivery 1. 5 (95 % CI 0. 8, 2. 9) and type of delivery 1. 9 (95 % CI 1. 0, 3. 6) were also associated with various <b>morbidities.</b> Conclusions: The findings showed a high proportion of postpartum <b>morbidities</b> being reported in our study settings. These observation priorities a need of health program for early recognition, treatment and improving awareness of postpartum <b>morbidities</b> among near mothers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Total hip (THA) {{and knee}} (TKA) {{arthroplasty}} are common orthopaedic procedures most frequently for older people. Whilst {{it is known}} that this older population frequently present with medical <b>morbidities,</b> no studies have previously documented the prevalence of such <b>morbidities</b> in people who have undergone THA or TKA. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the prevalence and what factors are in association with the presentation of medical <b>morbidities</b> in these populations. Methods: Data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative, a population-based observational study, was assessed. In total 419 people who had undergone a THA or TKA were assessed to determine the prevalence of recorded <b>morbidities</b> within 12 months post-arthroplasty. All medical <b>morbidities</b> were then assessed using univariate and then multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify factors influencing the presentation of specific <b>morbidities</b> at 12 months following THA or TKA. Results: The most common medical <b>morbidities</b> included: osteoporosis (16 %), mild to moderate depression (8 %), cancer (8 %), diabetes (6 %), history of stroke or TIA (6 %) and asthma (5 %). The medical <b>morbidities</b> demonstrated are similar between those who undergo THA and TKA. Only gender and ethnic origin were identified as statistically significant predictors of medical <b>morbidities</b> in these populations. Gender was a predictor of history of heart failure, whilst ethnic origin significantly predicted depression. Conclusions: People who undergo THA or TKA may present with a variety of medical <b>morbidities.</b> Accordingly consideration should be made on how to encourage the adoption and maintenance of physical activity and healthy lifestyle choices for this population...|$|R

5|$|Several {{species of}} fungi infect {{the roots of}} waratahs, causing {{significant}} plant <b>morbidity</b> or death. Typical symptoms include yellow leaves, wilting, blackening and dieback or part {{or all of the}} plant, or lack of proteoid roots. The most common pathogen is the soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, which appears to be more problematic in cultivated plants than in wild populations. Mass plantings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney and at Mount Annan planted before the 2000 Summer Olympics were devastated by the disease. Rhizoctonia solani can cause damping off or root rot, and is an uncommon pathogen. Cylindrocarpon scoparium and C. destructans (now Nectria radicicola) are also uncommon causes of infection and result in decay of the crown of the plant.

40|$|Background: Recently, under National Health Mission {{alternate}} {{systems of}} Medicine are mainstreamed {{in public health}} care system. Effective action plan generation, logistic arrangement and roll out of these alternate systems of Medicine needs understanding on profile of <b>morbidities</b> among attendees who come to these facilities. Objectives: This study was planned to report profile of <b>morbidities,</b> age and sex differentials in specific <b>morbidities</b> among geriatric attendees in secondary level siddha health facilities. Materials and Methods: A facility based cross sectional study was conducted among elderly person (60 years and above) attending Siddha outpatient department (OPD) from two of the randomly selected sub district level siddha facilities in Erode district, Tamil Nadu, India. Information on socio-demographic variables like age, gender, education and clinical profile (diagnosis) were collected from records already maintained in the siddha OPD. <b>Morbidities</b> were summarized in terms of proportions based on age and gender. Age and sex specific differentials on specific <b>morbidities</b> were compared using 'z' test. Results: Of 2710 patients who visited these two siddha facilities during the reference period, 763 (28. 1 %) patients were elderly. Arthritis (45. 2 %), neuritis (8. 8 %), diabetes (6. 6 %), bronchial asthma (5. 2 %), hemiplegia (3. 7 %) were the top five <b>morbidities</b> diagnosed and treated among elderly attending the siddha OPD. There was a predilection towards elderly male for <b>morbidities</b> such as bronchial asthma and hemiplegia compared to elderly female. Similarly, higher proportions of lumbar spondylosis, hypertension and fungal skin diseases were reported among aged 80 years or more compared to elderly aged 60 - 79 years. Conclusion: Elderly constitute more than one fourth of outpatients load from siddha health facilities. Degenerative diseases like arthritis and non-communicable diseases were the common <b>morbidities</b> in this age group. Geriatric clinics and mobile clinics under siddha system may help in improving health care services...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{efficacy}} of single combined dose of Cefotaxime and Metronidazole against conventional regimen of Ampicllin and Metronidazole for five days for the prevention of infectious <b>morbidities</b> in cesarean deliveries. Methods: This study was carried out at Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital, Kathmandu from April to August 2011. Hundred patients, who had cesarean deliveries for various indications, were divided into two groups with fifty on each arm. Patients in group I were treated with intravenous single dose of Cefotaxime and Metronidazole after cord clamping, whereas those patients in group II were treated with Ampicillin and Metronidazole for five days. Efficacy of the treatment was compared in terms of postoperative infectious <b>morbidities,</b> duration of hospital stay and cost of antibiotics. Results: Overall ten cases (10 %) had post-operative complications in which eight (8 %) had infectious and two (2 %) had thrombophlebitis. The infectious <b>morbidities</b> were febrile <b>morbidities</b> in four cases (4 %) followed by urinary tract infection in three cases (3 %) and wound infection in one case (1 %). There was no statistically significant difference among distribution of these <b>morbidities</b> and in the mean duration hospital stay. The cost of single dose regimen was one-eighth of the multiple dose regimens which was statistically significant (p= 0. 000). Conclusions: Single dose of Cefotaxime and Metronidazole was equally effective as multiple doses of Ampicllin and Metronidazole for five days in prevention of infectious <b>morbidities</b> with benefit of cost...|$|R
40|$|We found a high {{burden of}} <b>morbidities</b> in {{a cohort of}} {{neonates}} observed in rural Gadchiroli, India. We hypothesised that interventions would {{reduce the incidence of}} neonatal <b>morbidities,</b> including the seasonal increase observed in many of them. This article reports the effect of home-based neonatal care on neonatal <b>morbidities</b> in the intervention arm of the field trial by comparing the early vs late periods, and the possible explanation for this effect. METHODS: During 3 years (1995 to 1998), trained village-health-workers (VHWs) in 39 villages prospectively collected data by making home visits during pregnancy, home-delivery and during neonatal period. We estimated the incidence and burden of neonatal <b>morbidities</b> over the 3 years from these data. In the first year, the VHWs made home visits only to observe. From the second year, they assisted mothers in neonatal care and managed the sick neonates at home. Health education of mothers and family members, individually and in group, was added in the third year. We measured the coverage of interventions over the 3 years and evaluated maternal knowledge and practices on 21 indicators in the third year. The effect on 17 <b>morbidities</b> was estimated by comparing the incidence in the first year with the third year. RESULTS: The VHWs observed 763 neonates in the first year, 685 in the second and 913 in the third year.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{understand}} {{the prevalence of}} postpartum <b>morbidities</b> and factors associated with treatment-seeking behaviour among currently married women aged 15 - 49 residing in rural India. METHODS: We used data from the nationally representative District Level Household Survey from 2007 - 2008. Cross-tabulation was used to {{understand the}} differentials for the prevalence of postpartum <b>morbidities</b> and treatment-seeking behaviours across selected background characteristics. Two-level binary logistic regression was applied to understand the factors associated with treatment-seeking behaviour. RESULTS: Approximately 39. 8 % of rural women suffered from {{at least one of}} the six postpartum <b>morbidities</b> including high fever, lower abdominal pain, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, excessive bleeding, convulsions, and severe headache. <b>Morbidities</b> were more prevalent among poor, illiterate, Muslim, and high-parity wom-en. About 55. 1 % of these rural women sought treatment/consultation for their problems. The odds of seeking treatment/consultation increased as economic status and years of schooling among both the woman and her husband increased. Poor, uneducated, unemployed, Hindu, and tribal women were less likely to seek treat-ment/consultation for postpartum <b>morbidities</b> than their counterparts were. The odds of seeking treatment/ consultation decreased as the distance to the nearest private health facility increased.

40|$|Abstract Objectives: to {{determine}} the prevalence {{of the most common}} <b>morbidities</b> in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants hospitalized in a newborn intensive care unit (NICU) and to evaluate the influence of these <b>morbidities</b> through the length of in-hospital stay. Methods: observational, longitudinal, prospective and analytical study in a high risk reference maternity NICU from Sergipe, realized with 158 ELBW infants admitted between March 2014 and April 2015. The analysis of the hospitalization time was realized through the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: the average weight of premature was 785, 2 g ± 138, 2 g. The gestational age vary from 22 to 35 weeks and the average was 26, 8 weeks. Of those admitted at NICU, sixty three (39, 9 %) were discharged and 95 (60, 1 %) died. The time of hospitalization was influenced for <b>morbidities</b> as: patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), intraventricular hemorrhage and sepsis. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was the most common complication (157 - 99, 4 %).

40|$|So far, {{it has not}} {{yet been}} studied whether {{socioeconomic}} status is associated with distinct frailty components and for which frailty component this association is the strongest. We aimed to examine the association between socioeconomic status and frailty and frailty components. In addition we assessed the mediating effect of the number of <b>morbidities</b> on the association between socioeconomic status and other frailty components. This is a cross-sectional study of pooled data of The Older Persons and Informal Caregivers Survey Minimum DataSet in the Netherlands among community-dwelling persons aged 55 years and older (n = 26, 014). Frailty was measured with a validated Frailty Index that consisted of 45 items. The Frailty Index contained six components: <b>morbidities,</b> limitations in activities of daily living (ADL), limitations in instrumental ADL (IADL), health-related quality of life, psychosocial health and self-rated health. Socioeconomic indicators used were education level and neighbourhood socioeconomic status. Persons with primary or secondary education had higher overall frailty and frailty component scores compared to persons with tertiary education (P <. 001). Lower education levels were most consistently associated with higher overall frailty, more <b>morbidities</b> and worse self-rated health (P <. 05 in all age groups). The strongest association was found between primary education and low psychosocial health for persons aged 55 - 69 years and more IADL limitations for persons aged 80 + years. Associations between neighborhood socioeconomic status and frailty (components) also showed inequalities, although less strong.
