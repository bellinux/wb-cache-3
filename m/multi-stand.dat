40|$|We {{propose a}} {{stochastic}} dynamic framework {{to model the}} management of a <b>multi-stand</b> forest under climate risk(strong wind occurrence). The preferences of the forest-owner are specified by a non-expected utility in order to separately analyse intertemporal substitution and risk aversion effects. A numerical method is developed to characterize the optimal forest management policies and the optimal consumption-saving strategy. The stochastic dynamic programming framework is applied to a non-industrial private forest-owner located in the North-East of France. We show that the optimal decisions both depend upon risk and time preference...|$|E
40|$|A growing {{interest}} in managing forest ecosystems calls for decision models that take into account attribute goals for large forest areas while continuing to recognize the individual stand as a basic unit of forest management. A dynamic, nonlinear forest management model is described that schedules silvicultural treatments for individual stands that are linked by <b>multi-stand</b> management constraints. A growth model useful for many eastern forest types accounts for stand dynamics resulting from cutting decisions. This modeling approach provides a framework for coordinating management goals over many stands while meeting the practical need for stand-level cutting prescriptions. An example problem demonstrates how to measure the tradeoff between economic efficiency and tree species diversity. Dimension limits and solver efficiency ar...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} to approximately solving the restricted-control LQR problem online is substantiated and applied in two case-studies.   The first {{example is a}} one-dimensional system whose exact solution is known.   The other one refers to the temperature control of a metallic strip at the exit of a <b>multi-stand</b> rolling mill.   The new (online-feedback) strategy employs a convenient version of the gradient method, where partial derivatives of the cost are taken {{with respect to the}} final penalization matrix coefficients and to the switching times where the control (de) saturates.   The calculations are based on exact algebraic formula, which do not involve trajectory simulations, and so reducing in principle the computational effort associated with receding horizon or nonlinear programming methods.    Fil: Costanza, Vicente.

40|$|Abstract. The {{magnetic}} method of steel mechanical properties and microstructure {{has been applied}} in {{the territory of the}} former USSR since early 70 s. The main principles of this testing are described in the standard GOST 30415 - 96 “The steel. The NDT of mechanical properties and microstructure of steel articles by magnetic technique”. The method is widely applied so it is completely presented in special literature. The present work describes the method application in iron and steel industry, particularly in a roll state testing. The following tasks are fulfilled by means of testing of structural stressed state of a roll barrel surface layers: 1. Accomplishment of incoming control of a roll structural stressed state before its service life starting. Incoming control makes it possible to reveal a roll residual stress caused by a supplier’s methodical violations. 2. Diagnosis of abnormal areas in a roll barrel working layer which appeared due to the roll damage in the run of operation. 3. Determination of the optimal depth of re-grinding which guarantees removal of layers with intolerable level of accumulated residual stress. Calculation of residual resource of each roll that allows to define optimal amount of roll inventory. Diagnostics of preparation and installation defects of rolls in the rolling mill stands. Optimal stress redistribution in <b>multi-stand</b> mills. Magnetic monitoring makes it possible to reduce roll consumption per a tonne of rolled products, to increase a roll service life and to improve geometric characteristics of rolled products...|$|E
40|$|Forests are {{increasingly}} threatened by windthrows but those composed of uneven-aged stand plots are generally less impacted by their effects. As a consequence, {{the management of}} such forests {{should be based on}} a joint management of all their different uneven-aged stand plots. This article determines the optimal management regime of uneven-aged forests under risk of windthrow and furthermore takes the risk preferences of the forest owner into account. This study analyzes optimal harvesting of uneven-aged stand plots by applying a Markov decision process (MDP) framework using an economic description of uneven-aged forestry. Two management types are considered: the joint uneven-aged forest management model in which the forest owner jointly manages all the different stand plots, and the independent uneven-aged forest management model that assumes that the forest owner independently manages each plot of the forest. The MDP framework is applied to a non-industrial private forest owner located in northeastern France. First, we show that the forest owner tends to converge toward a forest structure that is close to a normal forest in the joint uneven-aged forest management model. Second, we find that the independent uneven-aged forest management model poorly approximates the optimal <b>multi-stand</b> harvesting policy. Third, and more surprisingly, the levels of windthrow probability changes considered have little influence on the optimal harvesting strategies of the forest owner. Lastly, in contrast, the forest owner's risk aversion is shown to have a strong influence on the optimal policy.
