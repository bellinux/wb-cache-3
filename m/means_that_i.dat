500|$|Gillan was {{roommates}} with Ritchie Blackmore in the 1970s, {{but left}} the band in 1973 amid tensions with Blackmore and overall exhaustion. In a 2006 interview, Gillan said of Blackmore's final 1993 departure from Deep Purple, [...] "he {{turned into a}} really weird guy, and the day {{he walked out of}} the tour was the day the clouds disappeared and the day the sunshine came out and we haven't looked back since." [...] He added that [...] "there are certain personal issues that I have with Ritchie, which <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will never speak to him again. Nothing I'm going to discuss publicly, but deeply personal stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|Rivera is {{a devout}} Christian. During his childhood, {{neither he nor}} his family {{attended}} church, but after a born-again experience around the age of 21, Rivera became religious and converted from Catholicism to a Pentecostal faith. His parents followed his lead after seeing the difference it made in him. Rivera believes that God has a reason for everything that happens. For example, he found his failure in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series easier to deal with when he learned of the consequences it had for teammate Enrique Wilson. Had the Yankees won the series, Wilson would have remained in New York for the championship parade and would have departed for his native Dominican Republic on American Airlines Flight 587, which crashed shortly after takeoff and killed all 260 people aboard. Rivera told Wilson, [...] "I am glad we lost the World Series, because it <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> still have a friend." [...] Rivera's pitching glove was inscribed [...] "Phil. 4:13", in reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13 ("I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me").|$|E
2500|$|I did not {{say that}} I was an {{absolute}} pacifist, but rather that I has always been a convinced pacifist. While I am a convinced pacifist, there are circumstances in which I believe the use of force is appropriate [...] namely, {{in the face of an}} enemy unconditionally bent on destroying me and my people. ... I am a dedicated but not an absolute pacifist; this <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am opposed to the use of force under any circumstances except when confronted by an enemy who pursues the destruction of life as an end in itself.

2500|$|Confronting some critics' {{views that}} her content {{and style of}} writing is un-Christian-like, Coulter stated that [...] "I'm a Christian first and a mean-spirited, bigoted {{conservative}} second, and don't you ever forget it." [...] She also said, [...] "Christianity fuels everything I write. Being a Christian <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am called upon to do battle against lies, injustice, cruelty, hypocrisyâ€”you know, all the virtues in the church of liberalism". In , Coulter characterized {{the theory of evolution}} as bogus science, and contrasted her beliefs to what she called the left's [...] "obsession with Darwinism and the Darwinian view of the world, which replaces sanctification of life with sanctification of sex and death". Coulter subscribes to intelligent design, a theory that rejects evolution.|$|E
2500|$|The Progressive Party, led by Jim Anderton, {{had served}} as a steady {{coalition}} partner to Labour and the electorate probably expected it to remain so. The Green Party, which abstained from opposing the Labour-led government in supply and confidence votes through the life of the 48th Parliament (2005 to 2008), said on 20 October that the only party of the two main parties it could form a coalition with was Labour. In the light of New Zealand First's run-in with the Serious Fraud Office, John Key ruled out that party as a government support partner on 31 August 2008, saying [...] "the sheer weight of allegations and the actions of Mr Peters {{in the last few months}} <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have lost that confidence in him".|$|E
2500|$|Satirical impressionist {{television}} series Dead Ringers also parodied Torchwood, with Jon Culshaw playing Captain Jack and Jan Ravens as Gwen Cooper. The sketches parodied {{the level of}} sex in Torchwood, claiming [...] "we never deal with an alien unless at least one [...] has shagged it", and describing the lack of motivations of the characters. It also parodies the bisexuality of the characters and the melodramatic personality of Jack, who in the sketch walks extremely dramatically, swinging his coat about himself. Barrowman {{is described as a}} [...] "pound shop Tom Cruise", and reference is made to the perceived low-budget of the show, with Owen describing the Torchwood equipment as [...] "an Apple Mac with stickers on the case". Later spoofs in the final episode of the 2007 series of Dead Ringers featured Jack Harkness in a threesome with two Attack of the Cybermen-era Cybermen, and an elderly version called Driftwood, which claims to be [...] "separate from the Post Office, beyond the bingo hall and outside the Oxfam", a parody of Torchwood's opening narration. It also featured Albert Steptoe of Steptoe and Son {{as the leader of the}} team, claiming [...] "a terrible event in my past <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't die. It's called UK Gold", and parodied its use of amnesia pills (unnecessary for this team due to the onset of senile amnesia).|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{publication}} of his first book, My Story in 1975, he claimed that his wealth originated from being commissioned as a mineral-dowser and not from bending spoons and forks. In 2007, skeptics observed that Geller appeared to have dropped his claims that he does not perform magic tricks. Randi highlighted a quotation from the November 2007 issue of the magazine Magische Welt (Magic World) in which Geller said: [...] "I'll no longer say that I have supernatural powers. I am an entertainer. I want to do a good show. My entire character has changed." [...] In a later interview, Geller told Telepolis, [...] "I said to this German magazine, so what I did say, that I changed my character, {{to the best of my}} recollection, and I no longer say that I do supernatural things. It doesn't mean that I don't have powers. It <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't say 'it's supernatural', I say 'I'm a mystifier!' That's what I said. And the skeptics turned it around and said, 'Uri Geller said he's a magician!' I never said that." [...] In that interview, Geller further explained that when he is asked how he does his stunts, he tells children to [...] "Forget the paranormal. Forget spoon bending! Instead of that, focus on school! Become a positive thinker! Believe in yourself and create a target! Go to university! Never smoke! And never touch drugs! And think of success!" ...|$|E
