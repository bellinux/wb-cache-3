40|$|Abstract. Flow {{phenomenon}} in spot welding nugget of dissimilar materials was studied. <b>Metallographs</b> {{in the course}} of welding nugget formation were observed and analyzed, through which it was indicated that: in the early stage of welding nugget formation, spot welding of dissimilar materials made liquid metals in the nugget produce a violent stirring action because the electrodynamic force overcame the medium resistance, causing unevenness of elements and compositions in the welding nugget; and then the unevenness was represented by vortex flow by means of different resistances to corrosion. It was proposed that the formation law of welding nugget could be recognized according to the formation law of vortex flow, and the vortex flow often moved from later-molten metal to former-molten metal. The property of welded joint with vortex flow was poorer than that without vortex flow. Vortex flow is a kind of vortex form appearing under a certain action of welding time and welding current upon spot welding of dissimilar materials. In a normal temperature field, the liquid metal upon spot welding of dissimilar materials can stir and mix completely and then generate a mixture with even compositions, through which a reliable welding nugget can be formed.

40|$|The {{behaviors}} of high temperature corrosion on hot-dip aluminized on 9 Cr- 1 Mo and 310 stainless steels when catalyzed by NaCl and cyclic heating environment were studied experimentally. The corrosion behavior and morphological development were investigated by weight gain kinetics, <b>metallographs,</b> depths of attack, metal losses, and X-ray analyses. The results of 310 SS deposited with salt mixtures show that weight gain kinetics in simple oxidation reveals a steady-state parabolic rate law after 3 hr, while the kinetics with salt deposits display multi-stage growth rates. NaCl {{is the main}} corrosive specie in high-temperature corrosion involving mixtures of NaCl/Na 2 SO 4 and {{is responsible for the}} formation of internal attack. Uniform internal attack is the typical morphology of NaCl-induced hot corrosion, while the extent of intergranular attack is more pronounced as the content of Na 2 SO 4 in the mixture is increased. The thermal-cycling test results of 310 SS deposited NaCl and coated 7 wt%Si/ 93 wt%Al show that the aluminized layers have good corrosion resistance during the first four cycles of testing, while degradation occurs after testing for five cycles. The reason for degradation of aluminized layers is attributed to the formation of interconnecting voids caused by aluminum inward diffusion, chloridation/oxidation cyclic reactions and the penetration of molten NaCl through the voids into the alloy substrate. The 9 Cr- 1 Mo steels coated with 7 wt%Si/ 93 wt%Al oxidized at 750, 850, and 950 ?C in static air show that oxidation kinetics followed a parabolic rate law at 750 and 850 ?C. The cracks propagated through the FexAly layer due to the growth of brittle FeAl 2 and Fe 2 Al 5 at 750 and 850 ?C. The voids condensed in the interface of intermetallics and substrate are attributed to the Kirkendall effect. At 950 ?C, the fast growing aluminide layer has a different expansion coefficient than oxide scale, leading to scale cracking, oxygen penetration, and internal oxidized, evidenced by a rapid mass gain...|$|R
40|$|In {{friction}} stir welding (FSWing) {{the actual}} solid state joining takes place between the faying surfaces which form the weld seam. Thus the seam trace is often investigated for clues when {{the strength of the}} weld is reduced. Aluminum and its alloys are known to form a native, protective oxide on the surface. If these native surface oxides are not sufficiently broken up during the FSW process, they are reported to remain in the FSW interior and weaken the bond strength. This type of weld defect has been referred to as a lazy "S", lazy "Z", joint line defect, kissing bond, or residual oxide defect. Usually these defects are mitigated by modification of the process parameters, such as increased tool rotation rate, which causes a finer breakup of the native oxide particles. This study proposes that there may be an alternative mechanism for formation of oxides found within the weld nugget. As the oxidation rate increases at elevated temperatures above 400 C, it may be possible for enhanced oxidation to occur on the interior surfaces during the FSW process from entrained air entering the seam gap. Normally, FSWs of aluminum alloys are made without a purge gas and it is unknown how process parameters and initial fit up could affect a potential air path into the interior during the processing. In addition, variations in FSW parameters, such as the tool rotation, are known to have a strong influence on the FSW temperature which may affect the oxidation rate if internal surfaces are exposed to entrained air. A series of FSWs were made in 3 different thickness panels of AA 2219 (0. 95, 1. 27 and 1. 56 cm) at 2 different weld pitches. As the thickness of the panels increased, there was an increased tendency for a gap to form in advance of the weld tool. If sufficient air is able to enter the workpiece gap prior to consolidation, the weld temperature can increase the oxidation rate on the interior surfaces. These oxidation rates would also be accelerated in areas of localized liquation. <b>Metallographs</b> from the weld panels showed indications of liquation at the grain boundaries. In FSWs of thicker panels, these regions of liquation were found to be heavily oxidized. The quality of the FSWs was evaluated from tensile testing at room temperature. As the panel thickness increased, a slight decrease in tensile strength was observed which was attributed to the presence of oxides. No oxide formation was observed in the thinner workpieces, although there were indications of localized liquation at the grain boundaries. Results from this study will assist in a better understand of the mechanisms of oxide formation in FSW interiors and provide methodology for minimizing their occurrence...|$|R

My goal this summer was to analyze and evaluate the effects that heat exposure had on the PM 304 material at 500 C and 650 C. The material is composed of Ni-Cr, Ag, Cr 2 O 3, and eutectic BaF 2 -CaF 2. PM 304 is designed to {{eliminate the need for}} oil based lubricants in high temperature applications, while reducing friction and wear. However, further investigation was needed to thoroughly examine the properties of PM 304. The effects of heat exposure on PM 304 bushings were investigated. This investigation was necessary due to the high temperatures that the material would be exposed to in a typical application. Each bushing was cut into eight sections. The specimens were heated to 500 C or 650 C for time intervals from 1 hr to 5, 000 hrs. Control specimens were kept at room temperature.

For this study, the effectiveness of equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) to improve the material properties and processing characteristics of vacuum arc remelted (VAR) pure tantalum was determined. The primary objectives were: 1) determination of recrystallization temperatures for processed material 2) determination of the grain refinement potential of ECAE and 3) determination of the ability of ECAE to produce a homogeneous grain structure. The effects of initial grains size (as-cast: [] 5 mm, large: 500 [u]m - 2 mm, medium: 20 [u]m - 100 [u]m) and morphology, annealing temperature (23 ?C - 1370 ?C) and level of strain (one, two, or four extrusions) and extrusion route (C and E) on the recrystallized grain size, percent recrystallization, microstructural uniformity, grain morphology and Vickers microhardness were investigated. All extrusions were performed at room temperature in a 90 ? die using a punch speed of 5 mm/sec. Microstructural uniformity and morphology were observed and characterized using an optical <b>metallograph</b> equipped with a polarizing filter. Grain size measurements were made using the linear intercept method on optical micrographs. Four consecutive passes without intermediate annealing show that pure VAR tantalum is very workable when subjected to ECAE processing. The initial grain size and processing route have little if any effect on the workability or recrystallization temperature after one extrusion pass. Microhardness values are similar to published literature values produced by conventional deformation methods at equivalent strains and tend to increase significantly during the first two extrusions. Routes 2 C and 4 C result in fine (< 22 [u]m), uniform grains after annealing for the large and medium initial grain size materials but do not for the as-cast initial grain size. Route E results in fine-grained, homogeneous, equiaxed microstructures for all initial grain sizes with ~ 11 [u]m being the smallest produced. The microstructural homogeneity and uniformity, and the fine-grain size resulting from ECAE processing may be advantageous to those produced by the conventional methods such as rolling, swaging, forging and wire drawing, with the added advantage of being a bulk product.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{sudden failure}} of metal {{structures}} under load, {{which has been}} a design problem for many years, is characterized by a crack propagation rate which approaches the speed of sound in the material. These failures, which are often known as catastrophic fractures, may be divided into two types which depend on the particular material in question. Fractures which cause a very small amount of plastic deformation associated with low energy absorption are known as brittle fractures, whereas high energy absorption during fracture, due to large amounts of plastic deformation, is associated with ductile fracture. The Griffith theory for spontaneous fracture in brittle materials states that the strain energy released during fracture must be greater than the energy needed to form the new crack surface area. This theory, which has been verified experimentally for brittle materials, is not applicable to ductile materials since the energy of plastic deformation during crack propagation must be taken into account. The revised and simplified theory for ductile materials states that the strain energy must exceed the energy needed to cause plastic deformation ahead of the crack. The steps in the fracture of ductile materials are initiation, slow crack growth, and rapid or catastrophic crack propagation, and the variable plastic deformation involved in these steps causes the process to be complex in behavior and analysis. However, an understanding of the causes of slow and rapid crack growth can be obtained by studying the effects of plastic deformation at the tip of a propagating crack. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the factors which affect the tendency for a ductile crack to propagate catastrophically. This was accomplished through the use of two types of investigations. In the first investigation an attempt was made to obtain catastrophic failure in 18 x 32 inch uniaxially stressed sheets of commercial household aluminum foil by introducing a crack {{in the center of the}} sheet in such a manner that the crack was elongated outwards in each direction. The catastrophic failure which was observed, however, was due to the addition of extra energy to the system boundaries which was not accounted for in the theory. Slow crack propagation was also observed and led to the second investigation. The plastic deformation at the crack tip was studied by visual of the was done observation using a <b>metallograph</b> and by actual measurement amount of deformation occurring during crack growth. This with a Tukon microhardness tester in which indentations were placed on the foil specimens, which were later given a small crack at the center, and which were mounted in a drill press vise on the tester. The crack was then propagated by turning the screw on the vise and measurements of the deformation between the indentations were made. The photographs and measurements of the plastic deformation at the crack tip showed that deformation existed throughout the entire specimen and was not localized in a given area at the crack tip as has been assured in some theories. The existance of elastic strain in the material was shown by the occurrence of elastic recovery in the strain relieved areas of the cracked material although no differentiation could be made between the area of elastic and plastic deformation. The existance of a stable configuration of iso-strain contours surrounding the tip of the crack was also shown. Calculations of the strain energy needed to satisfy the plastic deformation energy requirements showed that a crack length of about 49 inches would be needed to cause catastrophic failure. This is much larger than the specimen size used and would explain the lack of rapid crack growth in the tests run under near theoretical conditions...|$|E
