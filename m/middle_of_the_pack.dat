5|$|Following {{the defeat}} in the post-season Halla {{replaced}} Vejvoda as head coach with Shim Eui-Sik. Shim had spent his entire professional career playing for Halla and during the 2007–2008 season he was the coach of Little Halla. As a player Shim had 30 points in 80 games. He vowed to reorganize the team and {{set his sights on}} a league championship. The team's general manager also hired Samuel H. Kim, then an analyst for SBS Sports and previously an NHL reporter from Vancouver, as a scout for the organization. Halla moved away from the heavy Czech influence which had previously dominated the team and filled 3 of the 4 spots for foreign players on the team with players from North America. Brock Radunske, Brad Fast and Jon Awe became the first three players from North America to play for the team. They also arranged for Eric Thurston, the head coach of University of Alberta's team, to spend the first 3 weeks of the training camp assisting the new coach and new North American players. Martinec was the only Czech player to remain on the team. In addition to the new foreigner players, Song Dong-hwan and Jang Jong-moon returned from military service. In the 2008 pre-season Anyang Cup, Halla finished 4th out of 5 teams. The AL increased the number of regular season games for the 2008–09 season to 36. In September head coach Shim was suspended for 5 games for refusal to play. The incident stemmed from a goal that was scored as the final buzzer sounded during a 21 September game against High1. Halla entered the dressing room and refused to return to the ice. The league considered the game a forfeit. Anyang Halla finished the season in first place with a total of 76 points. Their defeat of their rivals High1 in the final game of the season marks the first time a non-Japanese team had finished first place in the Asia League. Brock Radunske captured the titles for both the most goals scored with 29 and most points on the season with 57. Martinec finished in second place {{for the second year in}} a row in the assists category with 47. Overall the team finished with 5 players in the top 10 in the overall points tally. For the first time the team ended the season with the number one powerplay scoring 54 goals. In contrast to earlier seasons the team did not lead the league in short-handed goals, ranking in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> both in goals for and against. They were the only team not shutout during the regular season. After receiving a bye in the first round of the play-offs Halla had to face the Nippon Paper Cranes in the semi-final. They returned to Anyang for game 6 of the series leading 3–2. They were expected to win the series but Nippon's Ilmura scored two game-winning goals and the Japanese club defeated Anyang in 7 games.|$|E

Lancashire were second, and the matches between the two top teams both ended in draws; Yorkshire made 230 in the first innings of the first game, compared to Lancashire's 96, but still could not force a victory, and in the second - with a crowd of over 44,000 present over three days at Old Trafford - Yorkshire took a lead of seven runs on first innings, but as only two and a half hours of play had been possible on the second day, the game was drawn. Sussex, who finished third with 18 of 24 matches drawn, enjoyed 2,000 runs from Ranjitsinhji for the second season running, as he bettered the record for most runs in a Championship season to 2,563.

These two events catapulted him to 11th in the points standing, out of the Chase for the Cup. At Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Earnhardt and his crew made a critical decision to stay out on the final pit stop to get a much needed Top 10 finish to move him up to 10th in the points. He made the 2006 Chase for the NEXTEL Cup after finishing 17th in the Chevy Rock and Roll 400 at Richmond International Raceway on September 9, 2006. He came close to winning at Talladega, and was leading on the last lap when Brian Vickers made contact with Earnhardt's future teammate Jimmie Johnson, sending Johnson into Earnhardt and spinning both of them out. His points position going into the Chase was 6th. He finished the season 5th in the point standings, 147 points behind leader Jimmie Johnson.|$|E

Afterward, he placed fourth in the first Budweiser Duel, {{resulting}} in a ninth-place starting position in the 2013 Daytona 500. In the Daytona 500, Johnson started well, assuming the lead from Jeff Gordon on lap 33 and leading a handful of laps before falling back to the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack.</b> Over the last few laps, Johnson was racing alongside Brad Keselowski for the lead until a caution came out for debris. Johnson took the advantage of leading on the last restart. With five laps to go, Johnson led a lane with Greg Biffle and Danica Patrick. He then held off a last lap charge from Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Mark Martin to win his second Daytona 500. This was Johnson's first Daytona 500 win with regular crew chief Chad Knaus, as he won the 2006 race with Darian Grubb as Knaus was serving a five-race suspension. It {{was also the first}} time since his 2006 win that he finished better than 27th in the Daytona 500, after a streak of six years where he had never finished better than 27th because of crashes and mechanical failures.|$|E

25|$|John Paul Jones Arena {{opened in}} the Fall of 2006 and is the current venue for the men's and women's {{basketball}} teams. The previous facility, University Hall, was the smallest in the ACC until the addition of Miami (FL) to the conference.

The 1990s and 2000s have seen {{a bit of a}} slide for the program to the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> in the conference, but the hiring of coach Dave Leitao along with the 2006 opening of John Paul Jones Arena led to a short return to prominence, with the 2006-2007 team winning a share of the ACC regular season title and making it to {{the second round of the}} 2007 NCAA Tournament. The new arena is one of the three largest on-campus facilities in the Atlantic Coast Conference, with the only bigger arenas belonging to universities with far greater student populations. Dave Leitao was fired following the 2008-2009 season, and Tony Bennett, who had been the head coach of the Washington State Cougars, was hired. The 2013–14 season saw the Cavaliers win their first 30-win season since 1981–82, earn their first ACC regular season title since 1980–81, and their first ACC tournament championship since 1976. The 2014-2015 season saw the Cavaliers win their second straight ACC regular season title and post their second straight 30 plus win season, winning 32 games. Tony Bennett was named the ACC's men's basketball coach of the year for the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 season's.

Making up for the lack of linebackers were a plethora of defensive backs who played key roles on the unit, including three of the top six tacklers – junior Sterling Young (70 tackles, 2 interceptions, 3 fumble recoveries), and sophomores Chris Humes (50 tackles, 3.5 TFL), and Rocky Hayes (42 tackles, team-leading 3 interceptions, 10 pass breakups, 2 TFL). Other key contributors included junior Artez Brown (37 tackles, 10 pass breakups, interception), freshman Money Hunter (35 tackles), and junior Andrew Tryon (28 tackles, 5 pass breakups).|$|E
50|$|Approximately 13% of this 200-lap {{race was}} run under a caution flag; each green flag lasted {{for an average}} of 30 laps. There were four {{accidents}} in this event; a total of nine different cars were involved in the wreckage. Greg Sacks was credited as the last-place finisher on the fourth lap due to three-car pileup that also took Jimmy Means out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race and severely affected Bobby Hamilton. It took nearly two hours and fifty minutes to decide the race; Harry Gant would defeat an aging Darrell Waltrip by a distance of nearly five seconds. Gant would never win a NASCAR Cup Series racing event again after this one. The win turned out to be entirely based on fuel mileage; as Gant was barely running in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> racing <b>pack</b> before somehow picking up speed and acquiring the first-place position.|$|R
50|$|Matt Kenseth {{claimed the}} lead and led the field to the green flag on lap 175. One lap later, Hamlin got loose but saved his car, and teamed up with Ryan Newman {{to make a run}} past the leaders, {{allowing}} Newman to take the lead from Kenseth two laps later. On lap 180, the ninth caution flag was waved for a large crash on the back straightaway. It started when Montoya, running in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead <b>pack,</b> was touched by Hamlin, causing Montoya to spin into Bobby Labonte and collected seven more cars, including Martin Truex, Jr., Robby Gordon, David Stremme, Jeremy Mayfield, Jimmie Johnson, Michael Waltrip, and Sam Hornish, Jr.. Gordon took <b>the</b> worst <b>of</b> it, as his car was sent head on into inside wall, stoving in the entire front portion of his car. Newman continued to lead at the restart on lap 184, drafting with Earnhardt, Jr.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} for The New York Times, Charles Isherwood wrote that [...] "the recipe may be familiar, but the flavor is fresh in this undeniably crowd-pleasing musical." [...] "Starring a vibrant Ana Villafañe as Ms. Estefan and a {{commanding}} Josh Segarra {{as her husband}} and musical collaborator, the musical neatly showcases the boppy dance-floor hits and swoony ballads that made Ms. Estefan and the band Miami Sound Machine a radio and MTV staple in the 1980s... 'On Your Feet!' roars through the up-tempo numbers, choreographed with swirling skirts and swiveling hips by Sergio Trujillo. The very air in the room seems to vibrate when the crackerjack band strikes up. But with an often mechanical book, moving through its rags-to-riches paces as if to a rigid percussive beat, 'On Your Feet!' ultimately falls somewhere in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hefty <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> jukebox musicals that have plugged in to Broadway's power strip." ...|$|R
