Lap 42 saw first Sainz and then Verstappen overtake Palmer's Renault, who fell back to eleventh. Another lap later, Ricciardo changed tyres and came out fifth behind Massa, taking fourth three laps later. At the front, Hamilton and Vettel slowly closed on Rosberg, with {{the gap between the}} two also coming down. Vettel came onto the back of Hamilton with five laps remaining, chasing him closely for several laps before <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> in the second to last corner of lap 55, losing his chances at second place.|$|E
5|$|After <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> {{that led}} to York conceding a goal late on in a 1–1 draw away to Forest Green on 26 November 2011, he was {{replaced}} in the line-up by McGurk for the next match at home to Lincoln three days later. This {{was the start of}} a second extended spell out of the team for Smith that season, before returning to play as a defensive midfielder in a 3–5–2 formation for York's FA Trophy first-round replay away to Solihull Moors on 13 December 2011. He scored his first goal of the season in the 11th minute of this match, converting Scott Kerr's cross at the far post, with York going on to win 3–0. However, he returned to the bench for the subsequent league match against Kidderminster on 19 December 2011, with York reverting to their usual 4–3–3 formation. With York reverting to 3–5–2 for a 1–1 draw away to Mansfield on 26 December 2011, Smith returned as a defensive midfielder, but after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season was suspended for the reverse fixture at home to Mansfield on 1 January 2012. Smith captained York to victory in the 2012 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium on 12 May 2012, with Newport County being beaten 2–0. This was the first time York had won a national knockout competition. Eight days later, he captained York to a 2–1 victory over Luton in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium, meaning the club regained Football League status after eight years with promotion to League Two.|$|E

5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Montoya clinched his second consecutive pole position and his third of the season with a time of 1:22.216. Although he was happy with the feel of his car, he did not feel confident that he could take pole position. Montoya was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap 0.312 seconds slower and also went off into a gravel trap during qualifying. Michael Schumacher qualified third and admitted to <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> on his third run which prevented him from setting a quicker time. Ralf Schumacher had balance issues which meant his car alternated between understeer and oversteer en route to fourth position. He also managed three clear runs before his fourth was disrupted by a yellow flag. Trulli qualified fifth and was delighted with his car and tyres. Coulthard qualified in sixth position and felt his car's balance was good although felt it difficult to push hard and achieve ideal grip. Häkkinen took seventh and ran wide at the exit of Curva di Lesmo on his final timed run and crashed heavily into a barrier which resulted in a large amount of damage to the front and left side of his car. Häkkinen was unhurt but the crash caused qualifying to be suspended for thirteen minutes.|$|E
5|$|Trulli {{became the}} first driver to make a second pit stop on lap 28. Light rain began to fall on lap 29 and track started to become slippery. The gap between Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher fell by one second after the McLaren driver {{encountered}} lapped traffic on lap 30. Ralf Schumacher lost sixth position to teammate Button after <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> on the same lap, while Frentzen pulled off the track at the entry of First Curve to retire from a hydraulic pump issue which caused his gearbox to fail. Michael Schumacher closed the gap to Häkkinen by 0.7 seconds by lap 31, although he made minor contact with Zonta two laps later. Further down the order, Heidfeld overtook Trulli for 13th position on lap 34. The second round of pit stops began on the same lap when Irvine made a pit stop. Häkkinen made his second stop on lap 37, and {{came out of the}} pit lane 25.8 seconds behind rival Michael Schumacher but ahead of Coulthard. Michael Schumacher began to immediately pull away from Häkkinen. Coulthard, Barrichello and Button remained in third, fourth and fifth positions respectively, during their second stops on lap 38 and 39. Wurz went into retirement when he spun sideways near the entry of the pit lane on lap 40. Michael Schumacher took his final pit stop on the same lap, and emerged 4.1 seconds in front of Häkkinen.|$|E

5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} one hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Michael Schumacher achieved his sixth pole position of the season, his second at Monza, with a time of 1:23.770. Although he was happy with his car and tyres, he said that he did not make the best of session because of <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> at the first chicane during his first run. Michael Schumacher was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap time 0.027 seconds slower and was happy to start alongside his teammate. Häkkinen qualified third, though he believed he could have set a faster time as he struggled with the handling on his car and his McLaren misfired on his final two timed laps. Villeneuve qualified fourth, nearly half a second behind Michael Schumacher, and stated that he was happy with his performance. Häkkinen's teammate Coulthard qualified fifth and was disappointed with his starting position because he encountered traffic during the session and was blocked by Frentzen. Trulli and Frentzen set the sixth and eighth fastest times respectively for Jordan; Trulli reported no problems while Frentzen was impeded by de la Rosa. Ralf Schumacher recorded the seventh quickest time and was disappointed in his performance. De la Rosa completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. His teammate Verstappen qualified eleventh having been forced to use two of his team's cars when they developed hydraulic and engine problems. Button qualified twelfth and said he overheated his tyres after running insufficient amounts of downforce. Wurz, who qualified in 13th, used the session to familiarise himself with Benetton's spare car. He was ahead of Irvine in the faster of the two Jaguar's, who set a best time that was one-tenth of a second faster than his own teammate Johnny Herbert in 18th; both were disadvantaged at the lack of straightline speed. Salo was 15th quickest for the Sauber team, ahead of his own teammate Diniz whose car handled badly under braking. The pair were marginally quicker than Zonta who encountered gear selection problems in his race car, and switched to his team's spare monocoque. The grid was completed by Alesi and Nick Heidfeld in the Prost's who qualified in front of the Minardi's of Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane.|$|E

Starr is considered to have influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings, as well as placing the drums on high risers for visibility as part of the band. According to Ken Micallef and Donnie Marshall, co-authors of Classic Rock Drummers: [...] "Ringo's fat tom sounds and delicate cymbal work were imitated by thousands of drummers." ...|$|E

[...] White went undrafted in the NBA draft after surrendering his final year of eligibility.

In the original script, Claire was [...] "happily married", but Curry chose to have her separated due to her husband's infidelity, so that she could be a [...] "more sympathetic character". Curry was influenced by the real-life story of Mary Kay Letourneau, a teacher who became involved with her underage student, causing her to be convicted for rape charges. Director Rob Cohen revealed that in Curry's draft, the character of Noah was younger, but he made the conscious decision to age him to 19, because he felt as if it was [...] "not healthy" [...] and that audiences would lose sympathy for the protagonist.

I got a drive-through for speeding behind the safety car and I had to fight my way through about three times. Eventually, on the last lap I was chasing down Seb. He ran a little bit wide onto the wet part of the circuit and I was able to take the opportunity and take the win." [...] Button also praised his team and strategy for helping him take the victory, in particular the moves to intermediate tyres. Vettel expressed his disappointment of <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> on the final lap, after driving a faultless race up to that point. Nevertheless, he was happy with second place, as he had increased his championship lead. Webber said he was happy to finish third after his incident {{at the beginning of the}} race, putting his recovery from fourteenth place down to correct tyre choices.|$|E
