40|$|In {{their recent}} Journal of Experimental Biology paper on mottle {{camouflage}} patterns of cuttlefish {{and the visual}} background stimuli that evoke them, Chiao et al. state that ‘the <b>mottle</b> <b>body</b> pattern works by the principle of background matching ’ (p. 188) (Chiao et al., 2010). ‘Mottle ’ and ‘disruptive ’ patterns doubtless contribute to camouflage in the animal kingdom – see Hugh B. Cott’s classic Adaptive Colouration in Animals [referenced in Chiao et al. (Chiao et al., 2010) ] – and the main contribution of Chiao et al. ’s recent paper is to have classified the patterns worn by young cuttlefish during experiments with artificial backgrounds [figures 4 – 7 in Chiao et al. (Chiao et al., 2010) ] according to granularity characteristics. However, {{the fact is that}} none of the small cuttlefishes in the 19 photographs of experiments designed to test their statement is ‘matching ’ the background. All stand out because average reflectance (albedo) of the body surface is different from average backgroun...|$|E
50|$|The adult black-thighed grosbeak is 20 cm long, weighs 70 g, and has {{a massive}} grey bill. The male has a yellow head, rump and underparts, an olive-edged black back, and black wings, thighs and tail. There is a white patch on the flight feathers. The female is paler with more olive {{on the back and}} a smaller white wing patch. Immatures are duller and more olive-tinged, and have {{streaking}} and <b>mottling</b> on the <b>body</b> plumage.|$|R
50|$|The {{most obvious}} ways {{to tell a}} grullo are not only the {{existence}} of gray or tan-gray body color, but also its primitive markings, which include {{some or all of}} the following: dark face, cobwebbing around the eyes and forehead, dark <b>mottling</b> on the <b>body,</b> leg barring (sometimes called tiger striping), dark ear tips and edging, dark ear barring, dark shadowing of the neck, dark dorsal and transverse striping, and dark mane and tail guard hairs.|$|R
5000|$|The Okefenokee pygmy sunfish is {{an olive}} green color fish with brownish-red <b>mottling</b> across the <b>body,</b> mixed with bright blue colors. Elassoma okefenokee differs from its close {{relative}} Elassoma gilberti by only having three preopercular canals (gilberti has, on average, four). The {{average number of}} anal fin rays is seven in E. gilberti whereas E. okefenokee has 8. The female E. gilberti often expresses a blue patch of color behind her eye and on her body, while the E. okefenokee does not ...|$|R
50|$|It has {{the ability}} to change colour, either to {{communicate}} their excitrement or to camouflage them. The most frequent colours recorded are brown or even blue, green or orange tones, or intermediate shades. It can display a pattern of pale, vertical and / or horizontal lines, or a dark <b>mottling</b> on the <b>body.</b> The dorsal and anal fins are semitransparent with a black dot in front of it. Typically it has a pattern of four white spots on the body, between the dorsal and anal fins; three white vertical lines in the long caudal peduncle and a black, submarginal, in each margin of the caudal fin dot.|$|R
40|$|Peanut (Arachis hypogaea [groundnut]) {{plants with}} reduced leaflets, {{chlorotic}} streaks, and stunting were observed during surveys for diseases caused by peanut viruses in India. These peanut plants were infected {{with a new}} caulimovirus designated peanut chlorotic streak virus (PClSV). PClSV was mechanically transmissible to several plants in Leguminosae and Solanaceae but was not transmitted by Aphis craccivora or Myzus persicae. Purified from Nicotiana clevelandii leaves, PClSV contained isometric particles 52 ± 3 nm in diameter. The virus {{was not related to}} cauliflower mosaic, figwort mosaic, or soybean chlorotic <b>mottle</b> viruses. Inclusion <b>bodies</b> similar to those produced by caulimoviruses were observed in the cytoplasm of infected Nicotiana rustica and A. hypogaea leaves. Purified PClSV contained two polypeptides with relative molecular masses of 58 and 51 kDa. The size of double-stranded DNA was estimated as approximately 8. 1 kbp, which contained two single-stranded discontinuities. The physical map of the PClSV genome was distinctly different from those of other caulimoviruses...|$|R
