40|$|International audienceThe main {{components}} of citrus fruit quality (organic acids, sugars, and aromatic compounds) were studied in fruits of a somatic hybrid allotetraploid between Willow leaf mandarin (Citrus deliciosa Ten.) + Eureka lemon [Citrus limon (L.) Burm. ] {{and the two}} diploid parents. The somatic hybrid (WLM + EUR) combined both nuclear genomes of the parents, with chloroplasts and mitochondria of mandarin. Variations in sugar and acid content were studied in fruit pulp during the maturing period, and the chemical composition of peel oils was investigated by capillary gas chromatography (GC), GC/mass spectrometry (MS), and (13) C NMR. The somatic hybrid {{was close to the}} lemon parent in the synthesis of organic acids and close to the mandarin parent in fructose content, while sucrose and glucose contents were between the two parents. The aromatic compounds of WLM + EUR were close to mandarin with a non-negligible effect of lemon, which inhibits the <b>methyl</b> <b>N-methylanthranilate,</b> a mandarin-specific compound. Our results lead us to conclude that biosynthesis of compounds involved in citrus fruit quality is not inherited in an additive way in the allotetraploid hybrid. We observed mandarin dominance for fructose and most of the aromatic compounds, lemon dominance for organic acid and <b>methyl</b> <b>N-methylanthranilate,</b> and codominance for sucrose and glucose...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Peel {{and leaf}} oils of 35 {{mandarin}} cultivars, belonging to five different species, {{were obtained from}} fruits and leaves collected on mandarin-trees kept at the same pedoclimatic and cultural conditions. Their chemical composi-tion was investigated by capillary GC, GC–MS and 13 C-NMR {{and the results were}} submitted to a statistical analysis. Two major chemotypes, limonene and limonene/γ-terpinene, were distinguished for peel oils, while five chemotypes, linalool, sabinene/linalool, β-pinene/linalool, γ-terpinene and <b>methyl</b> <b>N-methylanthranilate,</b> were observed for leaf oils. The results were compared with those already reported by our groups. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Choisya ternata Kunth (Rutaceae) is {{native to}} North America where it is popularly known as "Mexican orange". In this study, the {{anti-inflammatory}} effects of the essential oil (EO) obtained from the leaves of C. ternata, one of its minor components (ternanthranin - ISOAN) and its two synthetic analogues (<b>methyl</b> and propyl <b>N-methylanthranilate</b> - MAN and PAN) were evaluated. Mice pretreated with the EO (EO) obtained from C. ternata leaves (3 - 100 mg/kg, p. o.), ISOAN, MAN or PAN (1 - 30 mg/kg, p. o.) and the reference drugs, morphine (1 mg/kg, p. o.) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 100 mg/kg, p. o.), were evaluated in inflammation models such as formalin and subcutaneous air pouch models, with measurement of cell migration, exudate volume, protein extravasation, nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokines. The EO from C. ternata significantly inhibited {{the time that the}} animals spent licking the formalin-injected paw in {{the second phase of the}} model at their higher doses (30 and 100 mg/kg, respectively). An inhibition of the inflammatory reaction induced after subcutaneous carrageenan injection into air pouch was also observed. In this model, the EO significantly reduced cell migration, exudate volume, protein extravased, and the increase in levels of inflammatory mediators (nitric oxide, TNF-? and IL- 1 ?). ISOAN, MAN and PAN behaved in the same fashion at much smaller doses. Also, these molecules were able to show significant effects in the reduction of paw edema (at all tested doses) when the phlogistic agent was carrageenan, bradykinin, 5 -HT, PGE 2, C 48 / 80 or 12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- acetate (TPA). None of the tested doses had any effect in reducing histamine-induced edema. Our results indicate that the EO from C. ternata and anthranilate derivatives demonstrates an anti-inflammatory effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of different peroxidase {{preparations for the}} N-demethylation of <b>methyl</b> <b>N-methylanthranilate</b> to produce the food flavor methylanthranilate (MA) was investigated. All tested peroxidase preparations were able to catalyze the N-dealkylation. The tested soybean preparations vary widely {{with respect to their}} heme content. Furthermore, the operational stability of purified soybean peroxidase (SP) is at least 25 -fold lower than that of horseradish peroxidase and only 5 -fold higher than that of microperoxidase 8. Thus, the presence of a large protein chain around a porphyrin cofactor in a peroxidase is, by itself, insufficient to explain the observed differences in operational stability. Despite its relatively low operational stability, SP proved to be the most efficient biocatalyst for the production of MA with high yield and purity, especially observed at the high temperature and low pH values at which SP appeared to be optimally active...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine {{potential}} protective effects of <b>methyl</b> <b>N-methylanthranilate</b> (M) and isopropyl N-methylanthranilate (I) in a rat model of acute intoxication with carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) by tracking the changes in liver morphology and function. Serum transaminase and bilirubin were significantly elevated in animals treated with CCl 4 alone. A pretreatment with M and I prior to the administration of CCl 4 significantly prevented the increase of serum levels of liver damage markers. Histopathological evaluation of the livers of the test animals also revealed that M and I reduced the incidence of liver lesions. Our experiments showed that both M and I possess protective effect in CCl 4 -induced liver damage in rats. The results are of interest due to the presence of natural or synthetic M in the human diet.

40|$|Clementine is {{a natural}} tangor, {{resulting}} from an interspecific cross between mandarin and sweet orange. Gametic embryogenesis, allowing the single-step development of complete homozygous line from the heterozygous parents, increases the efficiency of perennial crop breeding programs. Tri-haploids have been regenerated through pollen embryogenesis (specifically, by anther culture) of Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan., cv. Nules. Two of them (HOMO 1 and HOMO 2) have been acclimatized and grafted in vivo in 2000. Research regarding the chemical characteristics of plant regenerated by pollen embryogenesis or gynogenesis are useful to study the “gametoclonal variation”, {{as well as for}} further application of haploidy technology in Citrus breeding. For these reasons and with the aim to characterize these homozygous clementine genotypes, in this study leaf essential oils were extracted by Clevenger apparatus and their chemical composition was investigated by capillary GC-MS, comparing them with oils obtained from the heterozygous plant and from its ancestors (clementine is a hybrid between sweet orange and mandarin). The obtained oil compositions, submitted to a statistical analysis, are partitioned into groups using principal components analysis (PCA) and, compared to those of both parents, distinguished in three major chemotypes sabinene/linalool, γ-terpinene and <b>methyl</b> <b>N-methylanthranilate...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{volatile}} compounds {{of fresh}} and air dried fruiting {{bodies of the}} wild edible giant puffball mushroom (Calvatia gigantea) were investigated by high resolution GC-MS using a sequential purge & trap technique. A total of 235 compounds were identified in this study with significant changes occurring during the ageing & sequential purging of the samples. Major volatiles in the “fresh ” samples were anisole (methoxybenzene), 3 -octanone, 3 -methylbutan- 1 -ol, 3 -octanol, methyl N,N-dimethylanthranilate and <b>methyl</b> <b>N-methylanthranilate.</b> Major volatiles in the “air dried ” samples initially were 3 -methylbutan- 1 -ol, 3 -methylbutanal and 2 -Methylbutanal; however, after the final 48 hour purge of the air dried sample, the 3 -methylbutan- 1 -ol, 3 -methylbutanal and 2 -Methylbutanal had decreased dramatically with substantial increases of isovaleric acid, 2 -methylbutyric acid, 2 -Phenylethyl alcohol, phenol, methyl N,N-dimethylanthranilate, several lactones, methionol and 4 -Hydroxy- 2 -pentanone. The isolation of the two aforementioned anthranilate esters along with a lesser amount of methyl anthranilate {{appears to be the}} first report of anthranilate esters in a mushroom species. Potential environmental contaminants, including VOC air pollutants in such analyses are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Ethnopharmacological relevance: Mexican people {{employed}} {{infusion of}} leaves of Choisya ternata Kunth for their antispasmodic and ?simulative properties? Aim of the study: In {{the present study}} the detailed GC and GC-MS analyses of the essential oil of Choisya ternata Kunth (Rutaceae) were performed. The presence of a minor constituent isopropyl N-methylanthranilate (1) was revealed among other identified volatiles. A synthesis of 1 was undertaken in order to corroborate this find and obtain gram quantities {{that would allow the}} testing of its biological activity (peripheral and central antinociceptive activity) Material and methods: The oils were investigated by GC and GC-MS. Synthesized compounds were spectrally characterized (UV-Vis, IR, 1 D and 2 D NMR, MS). The obtained synthetic samples of compounds were assayed for peripheral and central antinociceptive activity in two models (effects on acetic acid induced writhing in mice and the hot plate test for nociception). Results: Detailed GC and GC-MS analyses of the essential oil of Choisya ternata Kunth (Rutaceae) among 157 other identified volatiles revealed the presence of a minor constituent isopropyl N-methylanthranilate (1). Compound 1, named ternanthranin, is therefore detected as a natural product {{for the first time with}} a very restricted occurrence (samples of several citrus oils were screened for the presence of 1). The antinociceptive activities were assayed for ternanthtanin, the two other synthetic analogs, methyl and propyl N-methylanthranilate, as well as the essential oil and the crude ethanol extract of the leaves. The results clearly demonstrate a very high (even significant at 0. 3 mg/kg) dose dependent activity for the anthranilates (and the extracts). Isopropyl N-methylanthranilate showed the highest, while <b>methyl</b> <b>N-methylanthranilate</b> showed the lowest activity (with the methyl ester at 3 mg/kg still better than acetylsalicylic acid, at 200 mg/kg, in the first, or comparable with morphine, at 5 mg/kg, in the second test). Conclusion: This study once again revealed that detailed investigations of plant species with ethnopharmacologically documented activity may yield new natural compounds?a new alkaloid (ternanthranin), a volatile simple anthranilate that can be considered responsible for the antinociceptive activity of the crude plant extracts.
