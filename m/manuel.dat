5|$|Theophilos, in turn, was {{hesitant}} {{to believe the}} accusations, and was eventually convinced by the protovestiarios (chamberlain) Leo Chamodrakon and the synkellos John the Grammarian of his general's innocence. He therefore resolved to get <b>Manuel</b> to return, and sent John the Grammarian to Baghdad on a diplomatic mission {{in the winter of}} 829/830, ostensibly in order to announce his accession. John was indeed able to see <b>Manuel</b> in private and offered him the Emperor's pardon, which <b>Manuel</b> seemed to accept, although for the time being, <b>Manuel</b> remained publicly loyal to his Abbasid allegiance.|$|E
5|$|Yet Manuel's army of 35,000 men {{was large}} and {{unwieldy}} – according to a letter that <b>Manuel</b> sent to King Henry II of England, the advancing column was ten miles (16km) long. <b>Manuel</b> marched against Iconium via Laodicea, Chonae, Lampe, Celaenae, Choma, and Antioch. Just outside {{the entrance to the}} pass at Myriokephalon, <b>Manuel</b> was met by Turkish ambassadors, who offered peace on generous terms. Most of Manuel's generals and experienced courtiers urged him to accept the offer. The younger and more aggressive members of the court urged <b>Manuel</b> to attack, however, and he took their advice and continued his advance.|$|E
5|$|After 1147, {{however, the}} {{relations}} between the two leaders became friendlier. By 1148 <b>Manuel</b> had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad, whose sister-in-law Bertha of Sulzbach he had earlier married; he actually persuaded the German king to renew their alliance against Roger II of Sicily. Unfortunately for the Byzantine emperor, Conrad died in 1152, and despite repeated attempts, <b>Manuel</b> could not reach an agreement with his successor, Frederick I Barbarossa.|$|E

5|$|As a young man, <b>Manuel</b> {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the predominance of the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 {{years had passed since}} that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen <b>Manuel</b> involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire <b>Manuel</b> inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that <b>Manuel</b> used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E

5|$|In 1146 <b>Manuel</b> {{assembled}} {{his army}} {{at the military}} base Lopadion and {{set out on a}} punitive expedition against Masud the Sultan of Rûm, who had been repeatedly violating the frontiers of the Empire in western Anatolia and Cilicia. There was no attempt at a systematic conquest of territory, but Manuel's army defeated the Turks at Acroënus, before capturing and destroying the fortified town of Philomelion, removing its remaining Christian population. The Byzantine forces reached Masud's capital, Konya, and ravaged the area around the city, but could not assault its walls. Among Manuel's motives for mounting this razzia there included a wish to be seen in the West as actively espousing the crusading ideal; Kinnamos also attributed to <b>Manuel</b> a desire to show off his martial prowess to his new bride.* P. Magdalino, The Empire of <b>Manuel</b> I Komnenos, 42 While on this campaign <b>Manuel</b> received a letter from Louis VII of France announcing his intention of leading an army to the relief of the crusader states.|$|E
5|$|In 1147 <b>Manuel</b> {{was faced}} with war by Roger II of Sicily, whose fleet had {{captured}} the Byzantine island of Corfu and plundered Thebes and Corinth. However, despite being distracted by a Cuman attack in the Balkans, in 1148 <b>Manuel</b> enlisted the alliance of Conrad III of Germany, and {{the help of the}} Venetians, who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet. In 1149, <b>Manuel</b> recovered Corfu and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans, while Roger II sent George of Antioch with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople's suburbs. <b>Manuel</b> had already agreed with Conrad on a joint invasion and partition of southern Italy and Sicily. The renewal of the German alliance remained the principal orientation of Manuel's foreign policy {{for the rest of his}} reign, despite the gradual divergence of interests between the two empires after Conrad's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1394, {{relations}} between the Byzantines and the Ottomans changed for the worse and the war between the two resumed when the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid (ruled 1389–1402) ordered the execution of <b>Manuel</b> II after the Emperor attempted to reconcile his nephew John VII. The Ottoman Sultan then later changed his decision and demanded that a mosque and a Turkish colony be established in Constantinople. <b>Manuel</b> II not only refused this, he also refused to pay the Sultan tribute and {{went so far as}} to ignore the Sultan's messages, leading to a siege of the city in 1394. <b>Manuel</b> II called for a Crusade, which came in 1396. Under the future Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, the Crusade was crushed at Nicopolis in 1396.|$|E

5|$|John's chosen heir was {{his fourth}} son, <b>Manuel</b> I Komnenos, who campaigned aggressively against his {{neighbours}} {{both in the}} west and in the east. In Palestine, <b>Manuel</b> allied with the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and sent a large fleet to participate in a combined invasion of Fatimid Egypt. <b>Manuel</b> reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with Raynald, Prince of Antioch, and Amalric, King of Jerusalem. In an effort to restore Byzantine control over the ports of southern Italy, he sent an expedition to Italy in 1155, but disputes within the coalition led to the eventual failure of the campaign. Despite this military setback, Manuel's armies successfully invaded the Southern parts of Kingdom of Hungary in 1167, defeating the Hungarians at the Battle of Sirmium. By 1168, nearly the whole of the eastern Adriatic coast lay in Manuel's hands. <b>Manuel</b> made several alliances with the Pope and Western Christian kingdoms, and he successfully handled the passage of the Second Crusade through his empire.|$|E
