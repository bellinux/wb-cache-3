25|$|On January 27, 2009, {{one of the}} coaster cars did {{not make}} it over the last hill on the Fairly Odd Coaster and stalled. No one was hurt, and once the lap bars were unlatched, the riders in the stalled car were let off. The other two cars on the circuit were stopped safely by the computer's {{actuation}} of the ride's air brakes. The ride's air brakes <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> like a gunshot, which caused a small panic. The ride was running normally the next day.|$|E
25|$|In the 2005 novel Dead Lines by Greg Bear, a {{new type}} of analog cell phone called Trans with global reach, {{requiring}} no network of relay towers, is promoted by the book's protagonist, Peter Russell. The technology utilized by Trans uses the nearly unlimited quantum bandwidth by which subatomic particles communicate with each other, and when users of Trans begin to see ghosts, Peter gradually discovers that Trans has tapped into a channel where human memories are stored and survive the death of the body. Unfortunately, Trans has <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> and awakened nameless things much older than human beings, who feed on souls and memories.|$|E
25|$|In October 1963, {{along with}} Iain Macleod, Reginald Maudling and Lord Hailsham, Powell tried {{in vain to}} persuade Rab Butler not to serve under Alec Douglas-Home, in the belief that the latter would be unable to form a government. Powell commented that they had given Butler a revolver, which he had refused to use in case it <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> or hurt anyone. Macleod and Powell refused to serve in Home's Cabinet. This refusal is not usually {{attributed}} to personal antipathy to Douglas-Home but rather to anger at what Macleod and Powell saw as Macmillan's underhand manipulation of colleagues during the process of choosing a new leader. However, at the meeting at his house on the evening of 17 October, Powell, who still enjoyed a liberal reputation on racial issues after his Hola Massacre Speech, reportedly said of Home: “How can I serve under a man whose views on Africa are positively Portuguese?”.|$|E

500|$|When Maxwell {{was young}} {{his family moved}} to Glenlair House, which his parents had built on the [...] Middlebie estate. All {{indications}} suggest that Maxwell had maintained an unquenchable curiosity from an early age. By the age of three, everything that moved, shone, or <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> drew the question: [...] "what's the go o' that?" [...] In a passage added to a letter from his father to his sister-in-law Jane Cay in 1834, his mother described this innate sense of inquisitiveness: ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after Trafford piqued Starkey's {{interest}} in skiffle, the two began rehearsing {{songs in the}} manufacturing plant's cellar during their lunch breaks. Trafford recalled: [...] "I played a guitar, and [...] just <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> on a box ... Sometimes, he just slapped a biscuit tin with some keys, or banged {{on the backs of}} chairs." [...] The pair were joined by Starkey's neighbour and co-worker, the guitarist Eddie Miles, forming the Eddie Miles Band, later renamed Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares after a Liverpool landmark. The band performed popular skiffle songs such as [...] "Rock Island Line" [...] and [...] "Walking Cane", with Starkey raking a thimble across a washboard, creating primitive, driving rhythms. Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier, and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools. Though the lessons were short-lived, they provided Starkey and Trafford with an introduction that allowed them to dance competently while enjoying nights out on the town.|$|E
500|$|Lotus Engineering, a {{consultancy}} {{group of}} British sports carmaker Lotus Cars, partnered in 2009 with Harman Becker, {{a producer of}} audio systems, to develop and commercialize a synthetic automotive audio systems. Lotus has worked {{on a number of}} hybrid and electric vehicles and its engineers thought they would be safer if these vehicles <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> while moving around the factory. Originally developed to cancel out intrusive noises inside a car, the noise canceling system was adapted so that it could also simulate engine sounds that change with speed and use of the throttle, providing audible [...] "feedback" [...] to drivers of vehicles with a silent engine. At the same time, and through the addition of external speakers, the sound system allows pedestrians to hear the noise too, but optionally there can be a different sound within the car from the one that is emitted for the outside. Lotus used a Toyota Prius to demonstrate the device but did not reveal if it intended to bring this technology to market.|$|E

2500|$|The court-martial {{was held}} at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, {{beginning}} in October 2008, with Colonel Stephen Henley sitting as the trial judge. During the trial, Sergeant Sandra Pelton, a 42nd Division cook, testified for the prosecution that Martinez twice mentioned fragging when he came through her dining facility {{a few days before}} the explosion. On one occasion when Pelton asked Martinez how he was doing, he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> simulating an explosion and said, [...] "Frag him, frag. I mean it." [...] Approximately 20 other soldiers and officers testified that they had heard Martinez threaten or insult Esposito.|$|E
2500|$|A unique case in French literature, {{he was for}} a {{long time}} {{considered}} to be as scandalous a writer as the Marquis de Sade or Nicolas-Edme Rétif. [...] He was a military officer with no illusions about human relations, and an amateur writer; however, his initial plan was to [...] "write a work which departed from the ordinary, which <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise,</b> and which would remain on earth after his death"; {{from this point of view}} he mostly attained his goals, with the fame of his masterwork Les Liaisons dangereuses. It is one of the masterpieces of novelistic literature of the 18th century, which explores the amorous intrigues of the aristocracy. It has inspired a large number of critical and analytic commentaries, plays, and films.|$|E
2500|$|Vangelis {{was born}} 29 March 1943, in Agria, near Volos, Greece. Largely a self-taught musician, he {{reportedly}} began composing {{at the age}} of three. His earliest memory is [...] "playing piano, some percussion and whatever else that was available that <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise.</b> Right from the start, I was only interested in playing my own music". He refused to take traditional piano lessons, and throughout his career did not have substantial knowledge of reading or writing musical notation. When he was six, Vangelis's parents enrolled him at a specialist music school in Athens. He recalls [...] "I was lucky not to go because music schools close doors rather than open them". He studied painting, an art he still practices, at the Athens School of Fine Arts. Vangelis {{said in an interview with}} Life, when asked about his lack of ability to read music: ...|$|E

2500|$|I told Foster I {{should hold}} {{him for the}} money, and the old man, Van Triplett, said we acted as if we could not trust him, and gave {{some of the money}} back, and then said he would give us a chance to win it , so Foster turned the right card and [...] started to give him the money, but said, ‘Supposing you had bet that in earnest, did you have the money to put up?’ Foster said, ‘No,’ and turning to me said, ‘You have the money,’ and I said no, I did not have any money; that he took it all, but he said, ‘You have some dust,’ and wanted me to get it just to show the old man that we had the money in case the bet had been a real one. Bowers and I went to Kaufman’s store to get the money and Van Triplett and Foster {{remained}} behind. We came back with the dust and I unrolled it and showed them the sack, and the old man {{said he did not know}} if that was gold, and Bowers said, ‘Open it and show it to him, as he don’t know gold dust when he sees it,’ but I did not open it, and [...] just about to roll it up again, when Foster grabbed it and handing it to the old man, said, “Git!” and I started to grab the old man when they held me and said if I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> it would not be well for me. I pulled away from them and started after the old man, but could not see him and then went across the street and asked a party where there was an officer: that I had been robbed of $3,000 by some men over there.|$|E
