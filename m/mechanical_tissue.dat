50|$|Natural enemies can {{distinguish}} between <b>mechanical</b> <b>tissue</b> damage, which might occur during {{a number of}} events other than herbivory, and damage that is {{the direct result of}} insect feeding behavior. The presence of herbivore saliva or regurgitant mediates this differentiation and the resulting chemical pathway leads to a significantly stronger natural enemy response than mechanical damage could. The reliability of HIPVs in broadcasting the location of prey means that for many foraging enemies, induced plant volatiles are more attractive than even the odors emitted by the prey insect itself.|$|E
50|$|Peter Bowler in 1981, in a {{study of}} the {{cortical}} structure of the Ramalinaceae, recognized that: “Within Niebla two major evolutionary directions have influenced the anatomy of the cortex.

The two evolutionary lines thus became Niebla and Vermilacinia. Niebla tigrina, consequently, was transferred to Vermilacinia tigrina.|$|E

50|$|Active or dynamic sitting is the {{opposite}} of static sitting. Static sitting occurs when seating is rigid, and results in sustained <b>mechanical</b> <b>tissue</b> loading. The bodily strain occurring with traditional rigid seating is widely thought to contribute to negative health effects. The human body is not well adapted for long hours spent sitting in a restrictive or constrained posture. In static sitting, the abdominal muscles may instinctively relax and even atrophy over prolonged periods of lessened physical activity. Furthermore, the prolonged postural loading of the spine while sitting, without natural movement and mobilization of the spinal joints, can reduce joint lubrication and increase stiffness, which can be detrimental to back health. Circulation, particularly of the legs, can be adversely affected as well. In fact, back pain and circulation discomfort are part of a growing avalanche of complaints which can be attributed in part to extensive static sitting. Additionally, sustained postures at a computer can place the upper back and neck muscles into positions of strain that, when combined with stress factors, contribute to muscle tension and resulting pain. The field of ergonomics recognizes that only in recent history is {{a large proportion of the}} human population sitting for long periods with little movement. The rising number of office jobs, as well as driving, contributes to the increased amount of static sitting that occurs.|$|E

In these types of cells, mutations in BC 1 cause not only a reduction in cell wall thickness and cellulose content but also an increase in lignin level, suggesting that BC 1, a gene that controls the mechanical strength of monocots, {{plays an important role}} in the biosynthesis of the cell walls of <b>mechanical</b> <b>tissues...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{variations}} of anatomical traits under different environments (such as nutrients, oxygen and light) enable plants {{to adapt to}} these conditions (Sultan, 2000; Santamaria, 2002). Nutrient availability, particularly nitrogen, has been widely suggested to affect plant growth by anatomical responses (Garnier et al., 1999; Grassein et al., 2010). Investigation of wheat, barley and oats showed that reducing nitrogen fertilizer rates induced the production of denser tissues, higher structural carbohydrates and lignin content in the lower stem (Mulder 1954). In addition, in cereal plants, vascular bundle tissues consisting of phloem, xylem and the vascular bundle sheaths are critical for the transport of water, minerals, nutrients and for mechanical support (Li et al., 2009). In this study, low top-dressing N increased the thickness of <b>mechanical</b> <b>tissue</b> and induced well-developed vascular bundle tissue in culms, which enhanced the stiffness and mechanical strength of the stem. By contrast, under high top-dressing N, the sclerenchyma cell layers under the epidermal layer and areas of vascular bundles were reduced (Fig. 3). Correlation analysis showed that {{the thickness of the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>tissue,</b> the ALVB and the ASVB were significantly and negatively correlated with the lodging index but were significantly and positively correlated with the breaking strength (Table  3). These results suggest that a thicker <b>mechanical</b> <b>tissue,</b> ALVB and ASVB improves lodging resistance in japonica rice.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: A key {{structural}} adaptation of vascular plants was {{the evolution of}} specialized vascular and mechanical tissues, innovations likely to have generated novel cell wall architectures. While collenchyma is a strengthening tissue typically found in growing organs of angiosperms, a similar tissue occurs in the petiole of the fern Asplenium rutifolium. Methods: The in situ cell wall (ultra) structure and composition of this tissue was investigated and characterized mechanically as well as structurally through nano-indentation and wide-angle X-ray diffraction, respectively. Key Results: Structurally the <b>mechanical</b> <b>tissue</b> resembles sclerenchyma, while its biomechanical properties and molecular composition both share more characteristics with angiosperm collenchyma. Cell wall thickening only occurs late during cell expansion or after cell expansion has ceased. Conclusions: If the term collenchyma is reserved for walls that thicken during expansive growth, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>tissue</b> in A. rutifolium represents sclerenchyma that mimics the properties of collenchyma and {{has the ability to}} modify its mechanical properties through sclerification. These results support the view that collenchyma does not occur in ferns and most probably evolved in angiosperms...|$|E

30|$|The {{higher the}} lodging index, the more {{susceptible}} the lodging response to N was. For the Wuyunjing 23 cultivar, {{the response of}} the lodging rate in the field and the lodging index to top-dressing N tended to level off. With increasing top-dressing N application rates, the gravity centre height increased slightly but not significantly; however, the plant height increased higher (Table  1). Thus, to a certain extent, the lodging index of rice plants increased (Li et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015). Additionally, compared with LN treatments, the lignified cell walls in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>tissue</b> and vascular bundle sheath regions, which were closely related with stem stiffness, differed little (Figs. 3 and 5). However, the thickness of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>tissue,</b> the ALVB and the ASVB decreased significantly under HN conditions (Fig. 4, Table 2), resulting in a reduction in stem strength. These results were consistent with previous reports by Zhang et al. (2009).

We isolated a mutant, S 1 - 24, from ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) -treated plants of the japonica rice cultivar, Nipponbare. The mutant exhibited brittle culms and other pleiotropic phenotypes such as dwarfism and partial sterility. The brittle culms resulted from reduced mechanical strength due to a defect in thickening of the sclerenchyma cell wall and reduced cellulose content in the culms of the S 1 - 24 mutant. Map-based gene cloning and a complementation assay showed that phenotypes of the S 1 - 24 mutant were caused by a recessive point mutation in the OsCESA 7 gene, which encodes cellulose synthase A subunit 7. The missense mutation changed the highly conserved C 40 to Y in the zinc finger domain. The OsCESA 7 gene is expressed predominantly in the culm at the mature stage, particularly in <b>mechanical</b> <b>tissues</b> such as vascular bundles and sclerenchyma cells, consistent with the brittle phenotype in the culm.

Although {{it makes the}} differences in the soft tissues echogenicities’ apparent and clear, it fails in describing and estimating the soft <b>tissue</b> <b>mechanical</b> properties. It cannot portray their mechanical properties, such as the elasticity and stiffness. Estimating the mechanical properties increases chances of the identification of lesions or any pathological changes. Physicians are now characterizing the <b>tissue’s</b> <b>mechanical</b> properties as diagnostic metrics. Estimating the <b>tissue’s</b> <b>mechanical</b> properties is achieved by applying a force on the tissue and calculating the resulted shear wave speed. Due to the difficulty of calculating the shear wave speed precisely inside the tissue, it is estimated by analyzing ultrasound images of the tissue at a very high frame rate.

For a generalized soft tissue model, Agar-gelatine model is used because it has properties {{similar to that of the}} soft tissue. A point force is applied at the center of the proposed model. As a result of this force, a deformation is caused. Peak displacements are tracked along the lateral dimension of the model for estimating the shear wave speed of the propagating wave using the Time-To-Peak displacement (TTP) method. Experimental results have shown that the estimated speed of the shear wave is 5. 2 m/sec.
