40|$|This {{presentation}} {{summarizes the}} Systems Special Investigations Group (SIG) findings from testing {{and analysis of}} fastener assemblies used on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) structure, the tray <b>mounting</b> <b>clamps,</b> and by the various experimenters. The LDEF deintegration team and several experimenters noted severe fastener damage and hardware removal difficulties during post-flight activities. The System SIG has investigated all reported instances, and in all cases examined to date, the difficulties were attributed to galling during installation or post-flight removal. To date, no evidence of coldwelding was found. Correct selection of materials and lubricants as well as proper mechanical procedures is essential to ensure successful on-orbit or post-flight installation and removal of hardware...|$|E
40|$|A Seat Track Attach Mechanism (SAM) is a multiple-use {{clamping}} device {{intended for use}} in mounting various objects on the standard seat tracks used on the International Space Station (ISS). The basic SAM design could also be adapted to other settings in which seat tracks are available: for example, SAM-like devices {{could be used as}} universal aircraft-seat-track <b>mounting</b> <b>clamps.</b> A SAM (see figure) is easily installed by inserting it in a seat track, then actuating a locking lever to clamp the SAM to the track. The SAM includes an over-center locking feature that prevents premature disengagement that could be caused by some inadvertent movements of persons or objects in the vicinity. A SAM can be installed in, or removed from, any position along a seat track, without regard for the locations of the circular access holes. Hence, one or more SAM(s) can be used to mount an object or objects on a track or a pair of tracks in an infinite number of preferred configurations. A SAM can be incorporated into a dual swivel device, so that two of the SAMs can be made to lock onto two side-by-side seat tracks simultaneously, as would be the case in a standard ISS rack bay where two side-by-side racks reside. The main benefit to using two SAMs in a side-by-side arrangement is to provide a coupled load. By picking up load points on two seat tracks, a coupled loading is created, improving the stability and strength since the load is spread to two seat tracks at a short distance...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the study}} was to find a proper {{technique}} to fix tendon grafts into an INSTRON loading machine. From 8 human cadavers, 40 grafts were collected. We removed the bone-patella tendon-bone grafts, the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons, the quadriceps tendon-bone grafts, the Achilles tendons, and the peroneus longus tendons from each lower extremity. We tested the tendon grafts with five different types of fixation devices: surgical thread (Premicron 3), general <b>mounting</b> <b>clamp,</b> wire mesh, cement fixation, and a modified clamp for an INSTRON loading machine. The mean failure load in case of surgical thread fixation was (381 N ± 26 N). The results with the general clamp were (527 N ± 45 N). The wire meshes were more promising (750 N ± 21 N), but did not reach the outcomes we desired. Easy slippages of the ends of the tendons from the cement encasements were observed (253 N ± 18 N). We then began to use Shi’s clamp that could produce 977 N ± 416 N peak force. We combined Shi’s clamp with freezing of the graft and the rupture of the tendon itself demonstrated an average force of 2198 N ± 773 N. We determined that our modified frozen clamp fixed the specimens against high tensile forces...|$|R

The proximal and distal coordinates {{of the load}} transducer within the bone were also digitized to determine its relative offset with the anatomical long-axis. This coordinate system allowed for alignment of the anatomical long-axis relative to the actuator of a servo-hydraulic testing frame (Instron® 8501, Norwood, MA, USA).

This system was originally designed for the Course Setting Bomb Sight, and reused for the Mk. XIV, and now the Mk. III. The mounting base also retained the system for turning the entire sighting head to the left or right, which the bomb aimer used to keep the vertical line centered on the target and to call any required corrections to the pilot if he noticed any sideways drift. Unlike the Mk. XIV, this motion was unpowered. Although the computor was much smaller than the Mk. XIV's, it too could clamp into the same fittings in the aircraft. This allowed a Mk. III and Mk.

40|$|Collocated direct {{velocity}} feedback with ideal point force actuators mounted on structures is unconditionally stable and generates active damping. When inertial actuators {{are used to}} generate the control force, the system can become unstable even for moderate {{velocity feedback}} gains due to an additional - 180 ° phase lag introduced by the fundamental axial resonant mode of the inertial actuator. In this study a relative velocity sensor is used to implement an inner velocity feedback loop that generates internal damping in a lightweight, electrodynamic, inertial actuator. Simulation results for a model problem with the actuator <b>mounted</b> on a <b>clamped</b> plate show that, when internal relative velocity feedback is used {{in addition to a}} conventional external velocity feedback loop, there is an optimum combination of internal and external velocity feedback gains, which, for a given gain margin, maximizes vibration reduction.

40|$|Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) {{has proven}} to be {{beneficial}} in reducing recovery time, infection, and post-operative pain, but is inherently difficult due to the constraint of a single incision. The difficulties can be mitigated by using in vivo robots that can be inserted through the incision, with multiple arms and a vision system used to accomplish surgical tasks. Once the robot is inserted, it needs to be positioned so that it can focus on the target surgical site. Currently, this is accomplished manually with a table <b>mounted</b> support <b>clamp.</b> This thesis outlines the motivation, design, and evaluation of a proposed 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) gross positioning arm built to provide automated orientation control of an in vivo surgical robot, enabling it to reach any quadrant of the abdomen without having to stop the procedure and reorient the robot, while also providing enough force and torque to hold the robot steady during surgery. The proposed design is much smaller than current gross positioning arms, which reduces crowding over the patient, while also providing intuitive control to the surgeon. In particular, this thesis proposes a novel control scheme, which provides control of the system without changing control modes. Experimental results from a standard peg-transfer test show the proposed design is capable of operating in all quadrants, while maintaining the stability of the in vivo robot, providing smooth motion as the surgeon operates. Experiments performed by a surgeon at the University of Nebraska Medical Center showed the system provided intuitive control while accessing all necessary quadrants for surgery.
