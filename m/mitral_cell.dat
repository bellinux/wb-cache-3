To understand how these differences in activity arise, we have performed the first systematic comparison of synaptic and intrinsic properties between <b>mitral</b> and tufted <b>cells.</b> Consistent with previous studies, we found that tufted cells fire with higher probability and rates and shorter latencies than <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> in response to physiological afferent stimulation. This stronger response of tufted cells could be partially attributed to synaptic differences, as tufted cells received stronger afferent-evoked excitation than <b>mitral</b> <b>cells.</b> However, differences in intrinsic excitability {{also contributed to the}} differences between <b>mitral</b> and tufted <b>cell</b> activity. Compared to <b>mitral</b> <b>cells,</b> tufted cells exhibited twofold greater excitability and peak instantaneous firing rates. These differences in excitability probably arise from differential expression of voltage-gated potassium currents, as tufted cells exhibited faster action potential repolarization and afterhyperpolarizations than <b>mitral</b> <b>cells.</b> Surprisingly, <b>mitral</b> and tufted <b>cells</b> also showed firing mode differences. While both cell classes exhibited regular firing and irregular stuttering of action potential clusters, tufted cells demonstrated a greater propensity to stutter than <b>mitral</b> <b>cells.</b> Collectively, stronger afferent-evoked excitation, greater intrinsic excitability and more irregular firing in tufted cells can combine to drive distinct responses of <b>mitral</b> and tufted <b>cells</b> to afferent-evoked input...|$|R

These nerve fibers, lacking myelin sheaths, pass to the olfactory bulb of the brain through perforations in the cribriform plate, which in turn projects olfactory information to the olfactory cortex and other areas. The axons from the olfactory receptors converge in the outer layer of the olfactory bulb within small (≈50 micrometers in diameter) structures called glomeruli. <b>Mitral</b> <b>cells,</b> located in the inner layer of the olfactory bulb, form synapses with the axons of the sensory neurons within glomeruli and send {{the information about the}} odor {{to other parts of the}} olfactory system, where multiple signals may be processed to form a synthesized olfactory perception.

These two chemosensory systems show high similarity {{in the organization of}} information flow along their early stages: social chemical cues are detected by the sensory neurons of the main olfactory epithelium and the vomeronasal organ. These neurons then convey sensory information to the main (MOB) and accessory (AOB) olfactory bulbs, respectively, where they synapse upon <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> that project to higher brain areas. Yet, the functional difference between these two chemosensory systems remains unclear. We have previously shown that MOB and AOB <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> exhibit very distinct intrinsic biophysical properties leading to different types of information processing. Specifically, we found that unlike MOB <b>mitral</b> <b>cells,</b> AOB neurons display persistent firing responses to strong stimuli. These prolonged responses are mediated by long-lasting calcium-activated non-selective cationic current (Ican). In the current study we further examined the firing characteristics of these cells and their modulation by several neuromodulators. We found that AOB <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> display transient depolarizing afterpotentials (DAPs) following moderate firing. These DAPs are not found in MOB <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> that show instead robust hyperpolarizing afterpotentials. Unlike Ican, the DAPs of AOB <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> are activated by low levels of intracellular calcium and are relatively insensitive to flufenamic acid. Moreover, the cholinergic agonist carbachol exerts opposite effects on the persistent firing and DAPs of AOB <b>mitral</b> <b>cells.</b> We conclude that these phenomena are mediated by distinct biophysical mechanisms that may serve to mediate different types of information processing in the AOB at distinct brain states...|$|R

50|$|Mitral and tufted cells {{project to}} various {{targets in the}} brain. Most importantly, {{projections}} target the olfactory cortex, where odor information can be integrated with input from other sensory modalities and used to drive behavior. Tufted cells project mainly to the anterior olfactory nucleus, a center that also performs comparison between left and right side olfactory input. Mitral cells project to the olfactory tubercle, where chemical information is integrated with auditory signals. Mitral cells carrying pheromonal inputs project to the amygdala and hypothalamus to drive instinctive behaviors. A major integrative center is the piriform cortex, where mitral cells make non-topographic projections to pyramidal cells which integrate information across glomeruli. Projections also go to the entorhinal cortex. Anatomical connectivity of a <b>mitral</b> <b>cell</b> axon can be quite different depending on the target structure. Whereas piriform cortex is innervated mostly randomly, projections to the anterior olfactory nucleus and amygdala retain some topographic order.

The vertebrate olfactory bulb is an input area having unusual two-layer dendro-dendritic connections whose roles in odor coding are unclear. To clarify these roles, {{we built a}} detailed compartmental model of the rat olfactory bulb that synthesizes a much wider range of experimental observations on bulbar physiology and response dynamics than has hitherto been modeled. We predict that superficial-layer inhibitory interneurons (periglomerular cells) linearize the input-output transformation of the principal neurons (<b>mitral</b> <b>cells),</b> unlike previous models of contrast enhancement. The linearization is required to replicate observed linear summation of mitral odor responses. Further, in our model, action-potentials back-propagate along lateral dendrites of <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> and activate deep-layer inhibitory interneurons (granule cells). Using this, we propose sparse, long-range inhibition between <b>mitral</b> <b>cells,</b> mediated by granule cells, {{to explain how the}} respiratory phases of odor responses of sister <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> can be sometimes decorrelated as observed, despite receiving similar receptor input. We also rule out some alternative mechanisms. In our mechanism, we predict that a few distant <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> receiving input from different receptors, inhibit sister <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> differentially, by activating disjoint subsets of granule cells. This differential inhibition is strong enough to decorrelate their firing rate phases, and not merely modulate their spike timing.

We used in vivo two-photon calcium imaging for large scale functional mapping of distinct neuronal populations in the mouse OB, at single cell resolution. Specifically, we imaged odor responses of <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> tufted cells and glomerular interneurons. <b>Mitral</b> <b>cells</b> population activity was heterogeneous and only mildly correlated with the ORN inputs, supporting the view that discrete input maps undergo significant transformations at the output level of the OB.

Glomerular interneurons were also highly correlated with the ORN inputs, but showed higher activation thresholds suggesting that these neurons are driven by strongly activated glomeruli. Temporally, upon persistent odor exposure, tufted cells quickly adapted. In contrast, both <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> and glomerular interneurons showed diverse temporal response patterns, suggesting that glomerular interneurons could contribute to the transformations <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> undergo at slow time scales.

40|$|In the {{olfactory}} bulb, <b>mitral</b> and tufted <b>cells</b> receive GABAergic inhibition at dendrodendritic synapses with granule cells. Recent {{studies have}} revealed a remarkable {{variability in the}} subunit composition of GABA(a) receptors in dendrodendritic microcircuits, with differential expression patterns of the alpha 1 and alpha 3 subunits in different subtypes of <b>mitral</b> and tufted <b>cells.</b> In particular, all <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> express the alpha 1 subunit, whereas GABA(a) alpha 3 is restricted to a subgroup of <b>mitral</b> <b>cells,</b> {{as well as to}} several subtypes of tufted cells. To assess the functional relevance of this heterogeneity, we investigated a mouse strain carrying a genetic deletion of the alpha 1 subunit. Elimination of GABA(a) alpha 1 was partially compensated for in <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> by receptors containing the alpha 3 subunit, substantially decreasing the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents, as well as prolonging their decay time. Evoked inhibition between granule and <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> was slower to rise and decay and had smaller amplitude in alpha 1 mutants. Remarkably, these changes in synaptic inhibition were accompanied by a significant reduction in the frequency of field oscillations. Therefore, the subunit composition of GABA(a) receptors strongly influences rhythmic activities in the olfactory bulb network. Together, these data indicate that dendrodendritic circuits in the external plexiform layer segregate into parallel pathways involving distinct GABA(a) receptors that are expressed by different subtypes of <b>mitral</b> and tufted <b>cells...</b>|$|R

Axons of the mitral cells transfer information to a number of areas in the brain, including the piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. Mitral cells receive excitatory input from olfactory sensory neurons and external tufted cells on their primary dendrites, whereas inhibitory input arises either from granule cells onto their lateral dendrites and soma or from periglomerular cells onto their dendritic tuft. Mitral cells together with tufted cells form an obligatory relay for all olfactory information entering from the olfactory nerve. <b>Mitral</b> <b>cell</b> output is not a passive reflection of their input from the olfactory nerve. In mice, each <b>mitral</b> <b>cell</b> sends a single primary dendrite into a glomerulus receiving input from a population of olfactory sensory neurons expressing identical olfactory receptor proteins, yet the odor responsiveness of the 20-40 mitral cells connected to a single glomerulus (called sister mitral cells) is not identical to the tuning curve of the input cells, and also differs between sister mitral cells. The exact type of processing that mitral cells perform with their inputs still a matter of controversy. One prominent hypothesis is the notion that mitral cells transform the strength of olfactory input into a timing code, where odor concentration is encoded in the phase of <b>mitral</b> <b>cell</b> firing relative to the sniff cycle. A second (not necessarily exclusive) hypothesis is the idea of decorrelation in the olfactory bulb network, where the olfactory bulb network acts as a dynamical system whose action over time increases some (abstract) measure of distance between representations of highly similar odorants. Support for the second hypothesis comes primarily from research in zebrafish (where mitral and tufted cells cannot be distinguished).|$|E

5000|$|The basal {{dendrites}} of mitral {{cells are}} connected to interneurons known as granule cells, which by some theories produce lateral inhibition between mitral cells. The synapse between mitral and granule cells is of a rare class of synapses that are [...] "dendro-dendritic" [...] which means that {{both sides of the}} synapse are dendrites that release neurotransmitter. In this specific case, mitral cells release the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, and granule cells release the inhibitory neurotransmitter Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). As a result of its bi-directionality, the dendro-dendritic synapse can cause mitral cells to inhibit themselves (auto-inhibition), as well as neighboring mitral cells (lateral inhibition). More specifically, the granule cell layer receives excitatory glutamate signals from the basal dendrites of the mitral and tufted cells. The granule cell in turn releases GABA to cause an inhibitory effect on the <b>mitral</b> <b>cell.</b> More neurotransmitter is released from the activated <b>mitral</b> <b>cell</b> to the connected dendrite of the granule cell, making the inhibitory effect from the granule cell to the activated <b>mitral</b> <b>cell</b> stronger than the surrounding mitral cells. [...] It is not clear what the functional role of lateral inhibition would be, though it may be involved in boosting the signal-to-noise ratio of odor signals by silencing the basal firing rate of surrounding non-activated neurons.

[...] Other research suggest that the lateral inhibition contributes to differentiated odor responses, which aids in the processing and perception of distinct odors. There is also evidence of cholinergic effects on granule cells that enhance depolarization of granule cells making them more excitable which in turn increases inhibition of mitral cells. This may contribute to a more specific output from the olfactory bulb that would closer resemble the glomerular odor map.Olfaction is distinct from the other sensory systems where peripheral sensory receptors have a relay in the diencephalon.

Previous theoretical studies of these fast rhythms in other brain areas have proposed that principle neuron synchrony can be mediated by short-latency, rapidly decaying inhibition. This phasic inhibition provides a narrow time window for the principle neurons to fire, thus promoting synchrony. However, in the olfactory bulb, the inhibitory granule cells produce long lasting, small amplitude, asynchronous and aperiodic inhibitory input and thus the narrow time window that is required to synchronize spiking does not exist. Instead, {{it has been suggested that}} correlated output of the granule cells could serve to synchronize uncoupled <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> through a mechanism called "stochastic synchronization", wherein the synchronization arises through correlation of inputs to two neural oscillators. Almost all work on synchrony due to correlations presumes that the correlation is imposed and fixed.

No evidence for coincidence detection mechanisms was found; rather, action potential firing is controlled primarily by a slow membrane depolarization. In conclusion, the readout of information in Dp is determined by a balance of slow excitatory and inhibitory inputs that allows Dp neurons to detect defined patterns of excitation and inhibition across the population of <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> in the olfactory bulb. This mechanism does not depend on the synchronization of inputs and mediates the association of information about multiple molecular features of an odor stimulus.

The variability in sag expression reflects a functionally diverse population of <b>mitral</b> <b>cells.</b> For example, those cells with large amplitude sag exhibit more membrane noise, a lower rheobase and fire action potentials more regularly than cells where sag is absent. Thus, cell-to-cell variability in sag potential amplitude reflects diversity in the integrative properties of <b>mitral</b> <b>cells</b> that ensures a broad dynamic range for odor representation across these principal neurons...|$|R
