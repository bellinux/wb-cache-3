40|$|Background: Bulk-fill resin {{composite}} {{has been}} introduced, their manufacturers {{claimed that they}} can be applied in bulks of 4 mm, without necessitating a prolonged curing time, or a light curing unit with increased irradiance. Thus this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of resin thickness, and curing time on the <b>micro-hardness</b> of two bulk -fill resin composites; Tetric Evo-Ceram [TE], and X-trafil [XF]. Material and Methods: 120 cylindrical specimens were prepared, and divided into 24 groups (n= 5 /group), representing the two bulk-fill resin composites, three different material thicknesses (2, 3 and 4 mm) and the four curing times used in the study (10, 20, 40, and 60 seconds). The specimens were light-cured from the top surface only. Specimens were stored in light proof containers in complete darkness at 37 °C for 24 hours. <b>Micro-hardness</b> test was conducted on both top and bottom surfaces using Vickers <b>micro-hardness</b> tester with 500 g load and a dwell time of 15 seconds. Data were statistically analyzed by Four-way ANOVA of Variance. The significance level was set at P ≤ 0. 05. Pearson Correlation used to determine significant correlations between mean <b>micro-hardness</b> (top) and (bottom) surfaces. Results: Four way-ANOVA shows that different tested materials produce a statistically significant effect on mean <b>micro-hardness</b> (VHN) at p ≤ 0. 001, while thickness, curing time, and surface revealed statistically non significant effect on mean <b>micro-hardness</b> (VHN) at p ≥ 0. 05.

40|$|This work {{dealt with}} the problem of {{predicting}} contact, gap and joint conductances between conforming rough surfaces. The main purpose of the work was to investigate the effect of surface <b>micro-hardness</b> variation upon the prediction of thermal interface conductances under the first load cycle. A survey of the literature revealed that the title problem has received very little attention in the past three decades, especially from the thermal viewpoint. An investigation of surface <b>micro-hardness</b> variation was carried out. The investigation revealed that most engineering surfaces exhibit <b>micro-hardness</b> variation which depends upon the material type and the machining process. These findings were confirmed by a series of Vickers <b>micro-hardness</b> measurements for several engineering materials. A semi-general <b>micro-hardness</b> variation for these materials has been proposed which should be useful to thermal analysts. The theoretical thermal conductance models used in this work are those of Yovanovich and his co-workers. These models were reviewed and a mechanical model was proposed to estimate the appropriate contact hardness value required for accurate thermal predictions. The mechanical model was applicable for practical engineering joints and {{is a function of the}} surface parameters and the <b>micro-hardness</b> variation of a particular joint. An extensive experimental program was carried out employing different materials to verify the theoretical models over a broad range of surface roughnesses, thermophysical properties, <b>micro-hardness</b> variations and contact pressures. More than 400 contact conductance data points for Nickel 200, Stainless Steel 304, Zircolay- 4 and Zirconium- 2. 5 wt%Nb joints confirmed the validity the mechanical and contact conductance models. Also, experimental data for stainless steel joints in Nitrogen and Helium environments were obtained. The agreement between the measured and predicted joint conductances was excellent for Nitrogen data but seemed to break down for Helium. The deviations between some of the experimental data and the theoretical predictions were discussed. The discussion has emphasized the importance of the joints' geometric and thermophysical parameters which affected the predictions in vacuum or gaseous environments. The present work explained the apparent contradictory results obtained by various investigators for similar materials. It showed also that accurate thermal predictions depended more than had been realized upon the appropriate <b>micro-hardness</b> value which must be determined from the <b>micro-hardness</b> variation.

In this paper {{the effect of the}} P-content in the Ni-P coatings was experimentally studied on the thickness of the coating, on its nano-micro-structure and on its <b>micro-hardness.</b> The as-received samples were nano-crystalline (mostly amorphous according to XRD) and their <b>micro-hardness</b> was found to decrease with increasing the P-content. Upon annealing at 400 ◦C a new Ni 3 P phase was formed and the nano-cystalline Ni-rich grains coarsened to micro-grains. In this annealed state the <b>micro-hardness</b> was found to increase with increasing the P-content. A complex model was built to explain the experimental results. It was supposed that the as-received Ni-P coating contains almost pure Ni nano-grains surrounded by segregated P atoms; as the grain grows, its surface is covered more and more by the P atoms. When the grain is fully covered by the P atoms, further grain growth is inhibited and the coating can grow further only due to nucleation of a new grain. Thus, the size of the grains was found inversely proportional to the P-content of the Ni-P alloy. The need for a larger number of nucleation events with decreasing grain size explains why the coating has a smaller thickness for smaller grain size, i. e. higher P-content. The inverse Hall-Petch rule was found for the grain size dependence of <b>micro-hardness</b> of the as deposited samples due to the grain boundary sliding of relatively hard Ni-rich nano-crystals along the soft P atoms (higher P-content lead to lower <b>micro-hardness</b> through smaller grain size). After annealing the <b>micro-hardness</b> was found to increase with the volumetric phase fraction of the harder Ni 3 P phase within a relatively soft Ni matrix, i. e. it was found to increase with the P-content of the Ni-P coating.

30|$|This is an {{in vitro}} {{randomized}} controlled study; artificial enamel demineralization of human premolars was created and compared {{with reference to}} control. Quantitative surface <b>micro-hardness</b> assessment of the specimens was done with a digital display Vickers <b>micro-hardness</b> tester (MHT) (Model HVS- 50, Laizhou Huayin Testing Instrument Co., Ltd., China). The study also used a qualitative polarized light microscope (PLM) (Olympus dual stage polarized light microscope, Model BH- 2, Dualmont Corporation, Minneapolis, MN).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the Vickers surface <b>micro-hardness</b> and the depth of cure of two bulk-fill resin composites and one incremental-fill resin composite. Two Bulk-fill dental resin composites (X-tra Fil, Voco; Sonic-FillTM 2, Kerr Corporation) and an incremental-fill dental resin composite (Filtek™ Z 250 XT, 3 M ESPE) were used. Sixty cylindrical specimens of 4 mm thickness were prepared using split Teflon moulds. Specimens were divided into six groups (n= 10) according to the type of the material used and according to the insertion technique applied (bulk or incremental). Prepared specimens were stored dry in complete darkness at 37 °C for 24 hours. All specimens were tested for their Vickers surface <b>micro-hardness,</b> on their top and bottom surfaces. The depth of cure of the tested specimens was assessed by calculating the hardness ratio for each specimen. The Vickers surface <b>micro-hardness</b> and depth of cure data were analyzed for normality using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. Independent sample-t test was used to compare between two groups while One-way ANOVA was used to compare between more than two groups. Significant difference in the Vickers surface <b>micro-hardness</b> and depth of cure values was demonstrated among the tested materials (P< 0. 0001). X-tra Fil recorded the highest mean Vickers <b>micro-hardness</b> value (94. 05 ± 1. 05). Bulk-fill dental resin composites X-tra Fil and Sonic-Fill showed 0. 980 ± 0. 005 and 0. 921 ± 0. 020 depth of cure values (bottom/top hardness ratio) respectively while Z 250 XT recorded 0. 776 ± 0. 141. X-tra Fil showed highest Vickers surface <b>micro-hardness</b> values on both top and bottom surfaces, whether inserted in increments or bulk. Both bulk-fill resin composites showed higher depth of cure for both insertion techniques...|$|E
