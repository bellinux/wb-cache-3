Methods: We separately used <b>magnetic</b> <b>cell</b> sorting and flow cytometry sorting to identify CD 4 + CD 25 + Treg cells. After <b>magnetic</b> <b>cell</b> separation, we further used flow cytometry to analyze the purity of CD 4 + CD 25 + Treg cells, trypan blue staining to detect cell viability, and propidium iodide (PI) staining to assess the cell viability.

40|$|Abstract. A {{realistic}} quantum {{magnetic disk}} structure formed by a nanowire array is studied. The length fluctuation of the nanowires is described with Gaussian distributions. The magnetostatic interaction between two nanowires with different length and radius is derived.

The results show that when the <b>magnetic</b> <b>cell’s</b> spacing reduces (the storage density increases) or the nanowire length increases, damage spreading becomes difficult and the system stability is enhanced. In addition, the long-range magnetostatic interaction and the shape anisotropy make the system more stable and the nanowire length fluctuation influence is comparatively small...|$|R

40|$|Pulsed {{high power}} fast kickers {{are being used}} to change beam trajectories in {{particle}} accelerators. The fast rise and fall time of pulse waveform demands a transmission line structure for the kicker deflector design. The ideal design will be parallel metal plates. However, it uses very long straight sections to achieve the required deflection. In accelerators with constrained straight sections, high permeability materials such as ferrite have to be used to gain deflection efficiency. The transmission line kicker magnet is also referred as traveling wave kicker magnet. Its construction is based on distributed 1 -C cells along the longitudinal direction. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>cells</b> and capacitive cells are interleaved to simulate the characteristic impedance of a transmission line to minimize pulse reflection, and provide adequate frequency bandwidth to transmit the kicker pulse with fast rise and fall time. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>cells</b> are usually made of ferrite ceramics, but the capacitive cells have been made with different materials. For traveling wave kickers with higher impedance, the parallel plate vacuum capacitor has been used in CERN and KEK design. Others have used ceramic capacitors, printed circuit boards, and high permittivity ceramics as the capacitive cell. The high dielectric material has the advantage of compactness for low impedance kicker magnet construction. It continues to be very attractive for future kicker magnet applications. The high voltage phenomena associated with high dielectric ceramic materials have been widely reported in many industrial application areas. Their implication in the traveling wave magnet application has to be well understood. In this presentation, the areas requiring further quantitative study will be outlined...|$|R
