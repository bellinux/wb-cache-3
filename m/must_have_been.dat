Senators must be at least twenty-five years of age and representatives must be twenty-one when sworn into office. The candidate cannot hold any other public office in the state or federal government during their term. The candidate must also be a registered voter within the district they seek to represent.

5|$|The {{three primary}} {{branches}} of Crocodilia had diverged {{by the end}} of the Mesozoic. The earliest-known members of the group are alligatoroids and gavialoids that lived in North America and Europe during the Campanian (around 83.6–72.1 million years ago). Although the first known crocodyloids appeared in the Maastrichtian (around 72.1–66.0 million years ago), that lineage <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> present during the Campanian, and the earliest alligatoroids and gavialoids include highly derived forms, which indicates that the time of the actual divergence between the three lineages <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a pre-Campanian event.|$|E

5|$|If Sedna {{formed in}} its current location, the Sun's {{original}} protoplanetary disc must have extended as far as 75AU into space. Also, Sedna's initial orbit <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> approximately circular, otherwise its formation by the accretion of smaller bodies into a whole {{would not have been}} possible, because the large relative velocities between planetesimals would have been too disruptive. Therefore, it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> tugged into its current eccentric orbit by a gravitational interaction with another body. In their initial paper, Brown, Rabinowitz and colleagues suggested three possible candidates for the perturbing body: an unseen planet beyond the Kuiper belt, a single passing star, or one of the young stars embedded with the Sun in the stellar cluster in which it formed.|$|E
