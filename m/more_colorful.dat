5|$|Ikumi's initial {{vision for}} Tokyo Mew Mew {{was a story}} called Tokyo Black Cat Girl that {{featured}} a cat-girl battling alien invaders. After the story was transitioned to a more upbeat story of five female superhumans, the character designs were redone to have a lighter, <b>more</b> <b>colorful</b> feel. The main series characters were praised for being a perfect fit for the overall story, {{as well as for}} their cute appearances. The characters introduced in a la Mode were also praised for their visual appearances, but criticized as being repeats of the original series.|$|E

5|$|Mia Ikumi {{spent a year}} {{designing}} the Tokyo Mew Mew manga before {{the release of the}} first volume in February 2001. The story she originally presented to her editors, Tokyo Black Cat Girl, featured a heroine named Princess Azumi who is given the ability to transform into a cat-girl by an intergalactic police officer named Masha. He then asks her to aid him in defeating alien invaders called the Baku using her new powers. Azumi agrees, while trying to keep her new double life secret from her crush. After the production team decided to focus on five female superhumans, Ikumi was asked to reconstruct the lead character and the darker Princess Azumi was changed into the brighter and <b>more</b> <b>colorful</b> Ichigo. She had reservations about the changes, as the character was originally designed for a more dramatic series.|$|E
5|$|The Carnival of the Animals, Finale was {{directed}} by Goldberg; his wife Susan was its art director. The idea originated from animator Joe Grant, {{one of the two}} story directors on Fantasia who loved the ostriches in Dance of the Hours. When development for Fantasia 2000 began, Grant suggested the idea of having one of the ostriches play with a yo-yo to the last movement of The Carnival of the Animals. The ostriches were later changed to flamingos as Disney wished to avoid reintroducing characters from the original film and thought flamingos would look <b>more</b> <b>colorful</b> on the screen. Goldberg was partly inspired by co-director Mike Gabriel, who would play with a yo-yo as he took a break from working on Pocahontas (1995). The segment was produced with CGI and 6,000 watercolor paintings on heavy bond paper.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the First Issue (postage currency) was {{directly}} based on Spinner’s original handmade examples. Some varieties even had perforated stamp-like edge. While not actually legal tender, postage currency could be exchanged for United States Notes in $5 lots and were receivable in payment of all dues to the United States, up to $5. Subsequent issues would no longer include images of stamps and were referred to as Fractional Currency. Despite the July 1862 legislation, postage stamps remained a form of currency until postage currency gained momentum {{in the spring of}} 1863. In 1863, Secretary Chase asked for a new fractional currency that was harder to counterfeit than the postage currency. The new fractional currency notes were different from the 1862 postage currency issues. They were <b>more</b> <b>colorful</b> with printing on the reverse, and several anti-counterfeiting measures were employed: experimental paper, adding surcharges, overprints, blue end paper, silk fibers, and watermarks to name a few. Fractional currency shields which had single sided specimens were sold to banks to provide a standard for comparison for detecting counterfeits. Postage and fractional currency remained in use until 1876, when Congress authorized the minting of fractional silver coins to redeem the outstanding fractional currency.|$|E

25|$|Shostakovich {{admitted}} Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestration was <b>more</b> <b>colorful</b> {{than his}} own and used brighter timbres. However, he also felt that Rimsky-Korsakov chopped up the melodic lines too much and, by blending melody and subvoices, may have subverted much of Mussorgsky's intent. Shostakovich also felt that Rimsky-Korsakov {{did not use the}} orchestra flexibly enough to follow the characters' mood changes, instead making the orchestra calmer, more balanced.|$|E
25|$|Appliance {{designs in}} the early 1950s were often austere and functional, but from 1955 they became <b>more</b> <b>colorful</b> and diverse, so the {{housewife}} could demonstrate her good taste in selecting items {{that would make the}} kitchen more welcoming and that would showcase the family's prosperity.
