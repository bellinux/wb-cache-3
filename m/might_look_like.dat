In 1898, he founded L'Année Sociologique, the first French social science journal. Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, {{he published}} Suicide, a case study that provided an example of what the sociological monograph <b>might</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of quantitative methods in criminology during his suicide case study.|$|E

He {{looked for a}} location that could stand in for three different venues without the production having to move or change hotels: the film's opening scene; the God planet's establishing shots; and the Nimbus III Paradise City. Downs {{was familiar with the}} Mojave desert and thought that locations near Ridgecrest, California, would serve the production's needs, so he took photos based on sketches Rodis had provided of what the locations <b>might</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> Downs also shot photos with filters and tried to accomplish dust effects with his car to replicate ideas for how some sequences would be shot. When Downs returned with the photos, Shatner felt that the locations the scout found would be perfect for the film.|$|E

5|$|According to {{literary}} critics Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, possible fictional influences on Hergé's story include Jules Verne's 1870 novel Around the Moon and the 1950 American film Destination Moon. Hergé was certainly {{inspired by a}} number of photographic stills from the Destination Moon film which had been published. The computer system at the Sprodj space centre was visually based upon the UNIVAC I, the first computer to be created for non-military purposes. Hergé based his moon rocket on the designs of the V-2 rocket which had been developed by German scientists during World War II. The red-and-white checker pattern on Hergé's rocket was based upon an illustration of a V-2 which Hergé had come upon in Leslie Simon's 1947 book German Research in World War II. He commissioned the construction of a model rocket with detachable parts from his assistant Arthur Van Noeyen. He took the model to Paris where he showed it to Ananoff, asking him if it was a realistic representation of what a moon rocket <b>might</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> He and his assistants then used the model from which to accurately sketch when producing the comic.|$|E

25|$|We now {{discuss the}} {{position}} using the superko rule. For simplicity, {{we assume that}} the last move placed a stone in a position unoccupied {{since the beginning of the}} game, and away from the ko. Under positional and situational super ko, Black captures the white group. This is also the case with natural situational super ko if it is Black's turn. If it is White's turn however, then NSSK exhibits odd behavior. White can get a seki by passing, but only at the cost of allowing Black unlimited moves away from the ko. If White insists on saving their group, the final position <b>might</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the second diagram. On the other hand, with the first move (which should be a pass), White wins by two points in the third position using NSSK (assuming area scoring). Black's best response, in terms of maximizing their score, is a pass.|$|E
25|$|James Mensch {{provided}} {{an understanding of}} imagining the experiences of others (what can also be called empathic envisioning) and what that <b>might</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> {{when he talked about}} literary imagination humans: the capacity of humans to imagine the experiences of characters in novels. Mensch explained that human beings' embodiment provides them with the capacity to imagine these experiences and then relate to them through empathy. For Mensch, people are only capable of having experiences because of and through their body. Humans (Dasein) experience life, others, the world, etc. via their bodies which can taste, smell, hear, feel, and see. More to the point, their bodies encapsulate our various mental faculties required for processing and retaining those experiences. This means human experiences are experiences of the body. Relating to others then is when two bodies experience one another: they inter-relate. Because humans (Dasein) hold their bodily experiences in their memory, they are able to use our literary imagination to envision the experiences of characters in novels.|$|E

500|$|Although the Soviet High Command {{was alarmed}} by this, Stalin's {{belief that the}} Third Reich was {{unlikely}} to attack only two years after signing the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact resulted in a slow Soviet preparation. This fact aside, the Soviets did not entirely overlook the threat of their German neighbor, as well before the German invasion Marshal Semyon Timoshenko referred to the Germans as the Soviet Union's [...] "most important and strongest enemy" [...] and as early as July 1940, Red Army Chief of Staff, Boris Shaposhnikov, produced a preliminary three-pronged plan of attack for what a German invasion <b>might</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> remarkably similar to the actual attack. Since April 1941, the Germans had begun setting up Operation Haifisch and Operation Harpune to substantiate their claims that Britain was the real target. These simulated preparations in Norway and the English Channel coast included activities such as ship concentrations, reconnaissance flights and training exercises.|$|E
500|$|An {{extensive}} {{account of}} the controversy around the book was published {{at the same time}} as the new edition, largely supporting Wilson's views. Looking back at Sociobiology 35 years later, the philosopher of biology Michael Ruse called the book [...] "a pretty remarkable achievement" [...] of huge scope, [...] "firmly in the Darwinian paradigm of evolution through natural selection". He found one aspect of the book [...] "very peculiar" [...] in its [...] "metaphysical underpinning", namely that Wilson was committed to the idea of progress in biology, [...] "the idea that organic life has proceeded from the very simple to the very complex, from the value-free to the value-laden, from (as they used to say in the 19th century) the monad to the man." [...] Ruse observed that while producing humans <b>might</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> progress, evolution had [...] "also produced smallpox and syphilis and potato blight," [...] raising [...] "serious doubts about whether evolution is progressive." [...] Ruse noted that Gould's 1989 book Wonderful Life was entirely an attack on this idea of progress.|$|E

500|$|Another {{specimen}}, in the American Museum of Natural History under specimen number460, {{which is}} occasionally assigned to Apatosaurus, is considered nearly complete; only the head, feet, and {{sections of the}} tail are missing, {{and it was the}} first sauropod skeleton mounted. The specimen was found north of Medicine Bow, Wyoming, in 1898 by Walter Granger, and took the entire summer to extract. To complete the mount, sauropod feet that were discovered at the same quarry and a tail fashioned to appear as Marsh believed it shouldbut which had too few vertebraewere added. In addition, a sculpted model of what the museum thought the skull of this massive creature <b>might</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> was made. This was not a delicate skull like that of Diplodocuswhich was later found to be more accuratebut was based on [...] "the biggest, thickest, strongest skull bones, lower jaws and tooth crowns from three different quarries". These skulls were likely those of Camarasaurus, the only other sauropod for which good skull material was known at the time. The mount construction was overseen by Adam Hermann, who failed to find Apatosaurus skulls. Hermann was forced to sculpt a stand-in skull by hand. Osborn said in a publication that the skull was [...] "largely conjectural and based on that of Morosaurus" [...] (now Camarasaurus).|$|E
500|$|The {{enhanced}} TV {{coverage in}} 1994 {{was a crucial}} factor in ensuring that Orbital's performance at the festival achieved legendary status. As a result of Channel 4's coverage, living rooms across the country were able to experience what a rave <b>might</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> and suddenly dance music – which had been attacked by the establishment and mainstream press for years – didn't seem so dangerous. Indeed, 1994 was a crucial turning point for dance music's role at the festival. Speaking to The Guardian in 2013 about the Orbital gig, Michael Eavis noted that it marked dance music's appearance on the mainstream agenda. [...] "What was previously underground made it on {{to one of the}} big stages, and there was no going back from there. As the police and the council made me very well aware, the buzz had been around the raves and the market sound systems and in the travellers' fields for years. But it needed a showcase to make it legal." [...] The gig opened the way for others such as the Chemical Brothers, Massive Attack and Underworld, who all played high-profile stages in the following years – developments that led to the launch of the festival's Dance Village in 1997.|$|E
500|$|The {{reworked}} 1996 Broadway production received mixed reviews. Vincent Canby of The New York Times disliked it: [...] "This latest King and I <b>might</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> {{a million}} dollars as a regional production; on Broadway... it's a disappointment. The score remains enchanting but, somewhere along the line, {{there has been a}} serious failure of the theatrical imagination." [...] But Liz Smith enthused: [...] "The King and I is perfect"; and the Houston Chronicle wrote, of the subsequent tour, [...] "The King and I is the essence of musical theater, an occasion when drama, music, dance and decor combine to take the audience on an unforgettable journey." [...] Critic Richard Christiansen in the Chicago Tribune observed, of a 1998 tour stop at the Auditorium Theatre: [...] "Written in a more leisurely and innocent and less politically correct period, [...] cannot escape the 1990s onus of its condescending attitude toward the pidgin English monarch and his people. And its story moves at a pace that's a mite too slow for this more hurried day and age." [...] When the production reached London in 2000, however, it received uniformly positive reviews; the Financial Times called it [...] "a handsome, spectacular, strongly performed introduction to one of the truly great musicals".|$|E
