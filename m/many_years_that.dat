5|$|During {{this period}} the {{population}} of the nearby village of Burnside was expanding and required a new water supply. First Creekwhich runs down Waterfall Gully and enters the River Torrens near today's Botanic Gardenswas seen as the perfect solution to the water shortage. A weir was built during 1881 and 1882, and was made to hold approximately two megalitres (530,000USgallons) of water. A pipeline was constructed to the reservoir at Burnside South, and from there the water was used throughout the surrounding area. As a side effect, the weir also reduced the volume of water available to the local market gardeners, and over <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> aspect of the region disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The American Red Cross ran out {{of funds}} while {{responding}} {{to the effects of}} Juan and the mid-Atlantic flooding, following the previous responses to hurricanes Elena and Gloria, as well as flooding in Puerto Rico; this prompted an emergency fundraising appeal. The agency had provided about $8million worth of assistance to families in southern Louisiana. Along the Apalachicola Bay, the series of hurricane strikes severely damaged the local oyster industry, leaving hundreds of oystermen out of work. The high waves caused by Juan prompted the United States Minerals Management Service to recommend increased inspections on older rigs and improve evacuation plans. Hurricane Juan was one in a series of hurricanes that struck Louisiana coast over <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> contributed to the loss of the coastal wetlands.|$|E

Their last match at the stadium was the 2010 Championship {{play-off}} Final against Blackpool, which they lost 3–2. The final represented the first time Liverpool had visited the new Wembley Stadium; their previous appearances in the final in 2001, 2003 and 2005 had been played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff while Wembley was being rebuilt. Their last visit to Wembley was in 1996 when they reached the final of the FA Cup, match they lost 1–0 to Manchester United at the old Wembley Stadium.|$|E

25|$|Iron {{production}} continued steadily {{for many}} more decades; by the 1950s traditional iron mines had exhausted most of their resources. It had been known for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> northern Minnesota had an ore called taconite, which could be refined into iron through a process called beneficiation. A taconite processing plant was built further north along the North Shore at Silver Bay, and it quickly became the major taconite shipping port.

25|$|Most {{policies}} and practices, including {{the construction of}} Antarctic organizations were created initially by men. Women were originally excluded from early exploration in Antarctica based on the attitude that women could not handle the extremes in temperature or crisis situations. Vivian Fuchs, {{who was in charge}} of the British Antarctic Survey in the 1960s believed that women couldn't carry heavy equipment and that Antarctic facilities were unsuitable for women. The United States believed for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> the climate of Antarctic was too harsh for women.|$|E
25|$|The White Paper was {{published}} in February 1972, and it set out the case for metrication and refuted the charge of metrication by stealth as metric units had been lawful for most purposes since 1897. It also reported that metrication would be necessary for the UK to join the European Common Market and that as British industry was exporting to {{all parts of the}} world they would benefit. It also reiterated the previous government's policy that metrication should be voluntary and hoped metrication would be mostly complete within ten years. The expectation was also expressed that with both the imperial and metric systems coexisting for <b>many</b> <b>years,</b> <b>that</b> consumers would gradually become familiar and comfortable with the metric system.|$|E

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1957, rumors were abounding {{in the town of}} Stephenville that an American had {{purchased}} property with a great potential to the area.

25|$|Iowa Stadium was {{constructed}} in only seven months between 1928 and 1929. Groundbreaking and construction began on March 6, 1929. Workers worked around the clock using lights by night and horses and mules as the primary heavy-equipment movers. There was a rumor for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> horses that died during the process were buried under what now is the North end zone. Historians report this is a myth and the animals were disposed of in the nearby Iowa River. The round-the-clock construction {{came to an end}} in July. Despite several problems to overcome, including the athletic director's resignation and a slight redesign, the stadium was completed and the first game was played October 5, 1929, against Monmouth College. Iowa won the game 460. The stadium was dedicated two weeks later, when the Hawkeyes tied Illinois 77.|$|E
25|$|Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, in A los pies de Venus, {{writes that}} the then Bishop of Santa María had Borgia {{expelled}} from the church because his own father had died after being imprisoned under Alexander VI. It was held for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> the bones were lost, although in fact local tradition continued to mark their place quite accurately and folklore sprung up around Borgia's death and ghost. The bones were in fact dug up twice and reburied once by historians (both local and international—the first dig in 1886 involved the French historian Charles Yriarte, who also published works on the Borgias) seeking the resting place of the infamous Cesare Borgia. After Borgia was unearthed {{for the second time}} in 1945 his bones were taken for a rather lengthy forensic examination by Victoriano Juaristi, a surgeon by trade and Borgia aficionado, and the tests concurred with the preliminary ones carried out in the 19th century. There was evidence that the bones belonged to Borgia.|$|E

25|$|The 2003 Tour de France was {{the first}} for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> Ullrich had not been {{considered}} a favorite. In the first week, Ullrich became sick and almost retired.

Ullrich was within a minute of Armstrong in the classification. The next day, he closed the gap by another 19 seconds in the first mountain stage. Two days later Ullrich rode away from Armstrong on the Tourmalet but Armstrong caught up. Half way into the next climb, Luz Ardiden, Armstrong's handlebar got caught in a spectator's yellow musette waving in the air and he fell. Ullrich waited for Armstrong to recover, returning the courteous display by Armstrong 2 years previously. Armstrong then caught the group and attacked shortly afterwards.|$|E

It was a decisive win for Ma Ying-jeou as well, since he took over the party chairmanship only 110 days before.

25|$|In general, Chongryon is {{a declining}} {{organization}} primarily maintained by older Zainichi Chosenjin who appreciate the contributions {{the organization and}} the North Korean government has made to their lives, regardless of present political conditions. In comparison, third- and fourth-generation Zainichi Chosenjin have largely given up active participation or loyalty to the Chongryon ideology. Reasons stated for this increased disassociation include widespread mainstream tolerance of Koreans by Japanese in recent years, greatly reducing the need to rely on Chongryon, and the increasing unpopularity of Kim Jong Il even among loyal members of Chongryon. Many Zainichi Chosenjin also felt deeply betrayed by the North Korean government's recent admission that it had kidnapped at least 13 Japanese citizens over the years, because Chongryon had been categorically and fiercely denying for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> the abductions had ever taken place. Whether the officials of Chongryon knew of the kidnappings or not, ordinary members of Chongryon who had believed the party line felt deeply humiliated and disillusioned upon discovering {{that they had been}} used as mouthpieces to deny serious wrongdoing by North Korea.|$|E
