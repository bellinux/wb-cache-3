As of June 2008, over 60 different receiver models have been made, and stations have received blanket (no longer individual and experimental) authorization from the U.S. FCC to transmit in a multiplexed <b>multichannel</b> <b>mode</b> on FM. Originally, the use of HD Radio transmission on AM was limited to daytime only, and not allowed at night due to potential problems with skywave radio propagation. The FCC lifted this restriction in early 2007. DRM, however, is being used across Europe on shortwave, which is entirely AM skywave, without issue. With the proper receiver, many of those stations {{can be heard in}} North America as well, sans the analog signal.|$|E

The instrument performance is modeled using the spectral database and radiative transfer models developed from recent balloon-based {{studies of the}} upper atmosphere.

The resolution is 3. 5 km in the vertical and 500 km in the horizontal direction.

Equipped with a newly developed 6 Li glass scintillator (APLF 80), the detector was tested in a fusion experiment at the GEKKO XII facility, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan. For a low-ρR fusion shot, the detector clearly discriminated the γ-rays, primary neutrons, γ-rays produced via (n, γ) reactions from the target chamber, and neutrons scattered by the target chamber. Furthermore, the observed signal was in good agreement with predictions made by Monte Carlo simulation...|$|R

40|$|We study {{theoretically}} {{a quantum}} dot in the quantum Hall regime that is strongly coupled {{to a single}} lead via a point contact. We find that even when the transmission through the point contact is perfect, important features of the Coulomb blockade persist. In particular, the tunneling into the dot via a second weakly coupled lead is suppressed, and shows features which can be ascribed to elastic or inelastic cotunneling through the dot. When there is weak backscattering at the point contact, both the tunneling conductance and the differential capacitance are predicted to oscillate {{as a function of}} gate voltage. We point out that the dimensionless ratio ξ between the fractional oscillations in G and C is an intrinsic property of the dot, which, in principle, can be measured. We compute ξ within two models of electron-electron interactions. In addition, we discuss the role of additional channels. Comment: 11 pages REVTeX, 3 postscript figures (uuencoded and compressed).

40|$|Compact, highly {{customizable}} digital receivers {{are being}} developed for the system described in 'Radar Interferometer for Topographic Mapping of Glaciers and Ice Sheets' (NPO- 43962), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 31, No. 7 (August 2007), page 72. The receivers are required to operate in unison, sampling radar returns received by the antenna elements in a digital beam-forming (DBF) mode. The design of these receivers could also be adapted to commercial radar systems. At the time of reporting the information for this article, there were no commercially available digital receivers capable of satisfying all of the operational requirements and compact enough to be mounted directly on the antenna elements. A provided figure depicts the overall system of which the digital receivers are parts. Each digital receiver includes an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a demultiplexer (DMUX), and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The ADC effects 10 -bit band-pass sampling of input signals having frequencies up to 3. 5 GHz. The input samples are demultiplexed at a user-selectable rate of 1 : 2 or 1 : 4, then buffered in part of the FPGA that functions as a first-in/first-out (FIFO) memory. Another part of the FPGA serves as a controller for the ADC, DMUX, and FIFO memory and as an interface between (1) {{the rest of the}} receiver and (2) a front-panel data port (FPDP) bus, which is an industry-standard parallel data bus that has a high data-rate capability and multichannel configuration suitable for DBF. Still other parts of the FPGA in each receiver perform signal-processing functions. The digital receivers can be configured to operate in a stand-alone mode, or in a <b>multichannel</b> <b>mode</b> as needed for DBF. The customizability of the receiver makes it applicable to a broad range of system architectures. The capability for operation of receivers in either a stand-alone or a DBF mode enables the use of the receivers in an unprecedentedly wide variety of radar systems...|$|E
40|$|Neural {{stimulation}} is {{an established}} treatment methodology for {{an increasing number}} of diseases. Electrical Stimulation injects a stimulation signal through electrodes that are implanted in the target area of the central or peripheral nervous system in order to evoke a specific neuronal response that suppresses or treats pathological activity. This thesis discusses the design of neural stimulators: the device that is responsible for generating the stimulation signal in a safe, efficient and controlled manner. The design of such a device requires a highly multidisciplinary approach which involves disciplines such as neuroscience, electrophysiology, electrochemistry and electrical engineering. The first part of this thesis focuses on the processes associated with the neuronal recruitment. After describing the stimulation processes in detail at various levels, the discussion zooms in on the processes at the electrode-tissue interface and in particular the electrochemical behavior. Many neural stimulators include coupling capacitors between the stimulator and the electrodes {{to reduce the risk of}} potentially harmful electrochemical reactions. However, it is shown that coupling capacitors also have negative implications that need to be considered, such as a shift in the equilibrium potential of the electrode-tissue interface. Also, the reversibility of charge transfer processes at the electrode-tissue interface is analyzed. Most studies rely on monitoring the electrode-tissue interface potential to determine the maximum reversible charge injection limits. By measuring the reversible charge in a more direct way, it was found that under specific conditions the irreversible charge transfer processes already play a role for stimulation intensities that are well below the established charge injection limits. The extensive description of the stimulation process is furthermore used to introduce a fundamentally different stimulation paradigm. Instead of using a constant current or voltage to stimulate the electrodes, a high frequency, switched-mode stimulation signal is applied. The advantage of such a stimulation pattern is that it can be generated in a power efficient way by the neurostimulator circuit using switched-mode operation that is common in energy efficient amplifiers (class-D operation) or power management circuits. The efficacy of the proposed stimulation pattern is verified both using modeling as well as using in vitro measurements by analyzing the response of patch-clamped Purkinje cells. The second part of the thesis focuses on the electrical design of neural stimulators. The first system is designed to be used in a specific neuroscientific experiment and features arbitrary waveform stimulation. The user has full flexibility over the choice of stimulation waveform, while the stimulator circuit guarantees safety by ensuring charge balanced operation. The stimulator circuit is realized and included in a system implementation that is suitable for the specific in vivo experimental setup. The stimulation pulse (which uses a burst pattern) is synchronized with auditory stimulation in an attempt to recondition the neural pathways in a mouse that suffers from tinnitus. The second design implements the high-frequency switched-mode stimulation pattern that was introduced in the first part of the thesis. The system features an unfiltered forward buck-boost converter at its core to directly stimulate the target tissue. It is possible to operate the system with multiple independent channels that connect to an arbitrary electrode configuration, making the system well suited for current steering techniques. Furthermore, comprehensive control was implemented using a dual clock configuration that allows both autonomic tonic stimulation, as well as single shot stimulation. Each channel can be configured individually with tailored stimulation parameters and multiple channels can operate in a synchronized fashion. The system is power efficient, especially when compared with state-of-the-art constant current stimulators with an adaptive power supply that operate in <b>multichannel</b> <b>mode.</b> Efficiency improvements up to 200 % compared with state of the art constant current stimulators are demonstrated. Furthermore, the number of external components required is reduced to a single inductor. BioelectronicsElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E

A sensitivity {{enhancement of}} three {{orders of magnitude}} compared to the conventional transmission spectroscopic technique has been experimentally achieved. Applications to protein submonolayers adsorbed on glass surfaces provided the first results on the spectral characterization of those molecular films. The increased information content and the higher sensitivity response allowed us to experimentally determine the molecular orientation of organic films over a broad spectral range. The work developed here is a research tool that allows the investigation of some fundamental problems of molecular assemblies and a platform to develop new technological devices of high sensitivity and selectivity, such as biosensors...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} optimal routing on {{multilayered}} communication networks, which {{are composed of}} two layers of subnetworks. One is a wireless network, {{and the other is}} a wired network. We develop a simple recurrent algorithm to find an optimal routing on this kind of multilayered network, where the single-channel transmission <b>mode</b> and the <b>multichannel</b> transmission <b>mode</b> used on the wireless subnetwork are considered, respectively. Compared with the performance of the shortest path algorithm, our algorithm can significantly enhance the transport capacity. We show that our methods proposed in this letter could take advantage of the coupling of the two layers to the most extent, so that the wireless subnetwork could sufficiently utilize the wired subnetwork for transportation.

40|$|A {{new type}} of imaging Raman {{microscope}} is described. First {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the two possible approaches to Raman microscopy based on signal detection by means of a charge-coupled-device camera (i. e., direct imaging and image reconstruction) are discussed. Arguments are given to show that in most cases direct imaging is to be preferred over image reconstruction, because it provides the desired information in less time. In the direct imaging Raman microscope presented in this communication, detection of scattered light occurs in a narrow interval around a fixed wavelength. Selection of the Raman wavenumber shift at which an image is recorded is established by tuning the wavelength of the exciting laser light in such a way that the wavelength of the Raman scattered light with the desired Raman shift coincides with the detected wavelength. The microscope has been incorporated in a Raman microspectrometer in a way that enables easy switching between the imaging and the <b>multichannel</b> spectroscopy <b>modes</b> of operation. Bright field, fluorescence, and Raman microscopic images can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{multi-channel}} {{fiber optic}} surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor is reported. The sensing structure {{consists of a}} single-mode optical fiber, covered with a thin gold layer, which supports a surface plasmon (SP), and a Bragg grating. The Bragg grating induces coupling between the forward-propagating fundamental core mode and the back-propagating SP-cladding mode.

40|$|Using an {{inexpensive}} device and the <b>multichannel</b> scaling <b>mode</b> (MCS) of a multichannel analyzer (MCA), {{the determination of}} radiochemical purity as distinguished by the radiochromatographic technique may be easily and accurately performed. The availability of the sterile radiopharmaceutical kit has brought tremendous change and expansion {{to the practice of}} nuclear medicine. With the Mo- 99 /Tc- 99 m generator and the large number of commercially available agents for tagging with Tc- 99 m, clinicians may now choose from a diverse array of diagnostically specific kits. These kits have definite advantages over the previous on-site method of radiopharmaceutical preparation. In the past, radiopharmaceutical com-pounding from bulk reagents was generally limited to large medical centers with trained personnel and adequate facilities to perform manufacturing procedures. Under this arragement, it was the responsibility of each nuclear pharmacy or laboratory to verify total quality control of the compounded agent. Presently, it is the commercial manufacturer's responsibility to establish the quality of each kit ingredient as well as sterility and apyrogenicity in accordance with current Food and Drug Administration guidelines { 1). Assurance for final radiochemical purity following addition of the radiolabel remains, however, the responsibility of the user who prepares each kit in its final dosage form. Image quality may be significantly compromised by the presence of excessive quantities of radiochemical contaminants due either to improper preparation of these kits or oxidative decomposition following tagging with the radiolabel (2, 3).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{construct}} a successful Internet of things (IoT), reliable network construction and maintenance in a sensor domain should be supported. However, IEEE 802. 15. 4, {{which is the most}} representative wireless standard for IoT, still has problems in constructing a large-scale sensor network, such as beacon collision. To overcome some problems in IEEE 802. 15. 4, the 15. 4 e task group proposed various different modes of operation.

40|$|This report {{details the}} {{construction}} and testing of a unique analyzer for spin-polarized photoemission studies of magnetic materials. This report details the progress of this project for the period from 9 / 1 / 96 through 8 / 31 / 99. Progress {{can be divided into}} two distinct areas. These are the fabrication, construction, and initial testing of the instrumentation, and the concurrent program of preliminary investigations into materials and experiments appropriate for future studies using the instrumentation developed. The analyzer complete with special input electron optics and Mott detector has been assembled in a special design UHV chamber equipped with all the capabilities needed to perform the described programs of research. These include a sophisticated five motorized axis sample manipulator with low and high temperature capability and rapid temperature cycling (acquired in collaboration with Dr. J. G. Tobin of LLNL), vacuum leak detection and gauging, in situ thin film growth instrumentation, and sample cleaning and magnetizing capabilities, The initial testing of the analyzer has been completed with successful data acquisition using both the <b>multichannel</b> detector <b>mode,</b> and spin-dependent using the Mott detector channeltrons. The data collected using the Mott detector were not truly spin dependent (see below), but demonstrate the operation of the lens and detector design. Acquisition of truly spin-dependent data await use of the EPU. Preliminary indications suggest that the analyzer performs at or above the original design parameters. In the second area of progress, we have conducted a number of preliminary studies toward the ends of identifying appropriate initial systems for investigation, and to further explore new experiments that the new instrumentation will help to pioneer.

40|$|The rapid {{emergence}} {{and broad}} acceptance of electronic-based services (e-services) created many new managerial challenges and, as a result, offers important new research opportunities. Consider {{the challenge of}} managing online ser-vice quality. Much of the published {{research has focused on}} consumer-based issues relating to the definition and diagnosis of service quality in the e-service context, with most of the reported findings showing little correspondence or agreement (Rowley 2006). Largely missing in the scholarly literature is meaningful agreement as to how e-service providers can best design and deliver quality encounters. Generally, the exami-nation of e-service quality is complicated and confounded due to differences in units of analyses (e. g., service offering, delivery system), research objectives (e. g., generating descrip-tive vs. prescriptive insights), and scholarly perspectives (Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Malhotra 2005). Our objective is to advance insights, particularly those emanating from service operations management (SOM) (Metters and Marucheck 2007; Roth and Menor 2003), and enhance scholarly understanding and discourse on the design and delivery of quality e-service encounters. Leveraging SOM, or provider-based, views and insights allows for the systematic examination of the value-creating operating systems and strategies where customer—or user—inputs represent an important managerial variable (Sampson and Froehle 2006). We adopt the definition of an e-service as the provision of any service over electronic network formats such as the Web, information kiosks, and mobile devices (Rowley 2006; Rust and Lemon 2001). Focusing specifically on the Internet, the typical e-service—whether configured in a <b>multichannel</b> service <b>mode</b> or pure e-service mode— replaces the physical servicescape with a digital storefront that users can operate to procure desired offerings. The e-service encounter constitutes the period between “the ini-tial landing on the home page until the requested service has Toward a Provider-Based View o...|$|R
