50|$|On November 5, 1985, at a {{price of}} $58 per share, totaling $2.7 billion, Revlon was sold to Pantry Pride (later renamed to Revlon Group, Inc.), a {{subsidiary}} of Ronald Perelman's MacAndrews & Forbes. The buyout—engineered {{with the help of}} junk bond king Michael P. Milken—saddled Revlon with a huge $2.9 billion debt load, which became an albatross around the company's neck for years to come. Pantry Pride Inc. offered to buy any or all of Revlon's 38.2 million outstanding shares for $47.5 a share when its street price stood at $45 a share. Initially rejected, he repeatedly raised his offer until it reached $53 a share while fighting Revlon's management every step of the way. Forstmann Little & Company swooped in at $56 a share, a brief public bidding war ensued, and Perelman triumphed with an offer of $58 a share. Perelman paid $1.8 billion to Revlon's shareholders, but he also paid $900 million of other costs associated with the purchase. Perelman had Revlon sell four divisions: two for $1 billion, the vision care division for $574 million, and the National Health Laboratories division which became a publicly owned corporation in 1988. Additional <b>make-up</b> <b>lines</b> were purchased for Revlon: Max Factor in 1987 and Betrix in 1989, later sold to Procter & Gamble in 1991.

40|$|The {{current flowing}} through a {{separation}} column in CE generates reaction products at the inlet and outlet electrodes. OH- ions generated at the cathode can migrate into the CE column, change pH and thereby electro osmotic flow. These phenomena can be most clearly observed if {{the volume of}} inlet and outlet buffer reservoir is small. In the case of MS coupling, the CE/MS interface mimics the outlet buffer reservoir. When a coaxial make-up liquid is used, the outlet buffer reservoir has a small virtual volume, controlled by the make-up flow. Such volume is essentially zero for a sheathless interface. The effects of electrochemically generated ions has been studied and modifications to a coaxial CE/MS interface are investigated in order to eliminate interaction between interface and column. CE system: PRINCE Technologies programmable injector for CE. Mass spectrometer: NERMAG R 3010 triple quad with home made ESI source and CE/MS interface. The following parameters are monitored with a Sciex API 3 MS data system and a MacLab data acquisition system: mass spectra, UV absorbance, CE current, curtain plate current, orifice plate current, and skimmer current. The effect of OH- ion migration into the column {{is reflected in the}} CE current. We have studied the effect of make-up liquid composition. It appears that a certain concentration of acid is needed to balance the OH- ions. The construction of the CE/MS interface has been modified. The stainless steel capillary which is normally present in a coaxial interface for ESI acts as the out let electrode for the CE column. This SS capillary was replaced by a fused silica capillary, and the outlet electrode was positioned in the <b>make-up</b> liquid <b>line.</b> The effect of position of this electrode is investigated, together with the effects of make-up flow rate and make-up solution composition. The correlation between experimental parameters and signals read by the data systems will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 201 - 214. Environmental {{degradation}} {{is widely}} regarded {{as an integral part of}} South Africa's homeland areas. Conventional thinking often blames so-called traditional farming practices, attitudes and values for this situation. In other words, the blame is placed with the residents of the areas and environmental degradation is explained away as the result of a particular cultural <b>make-up.</b> Following this <b>line</b> of thought, education via agricultural extension is mooted as the primary solution to what is regarded as an inherent problem. The central concern of this dissertation is to examine the dynamics of natural resource management by residents of a rural area in KwaZulu known as oBivane. The thesis shows that the conditions leading to environmental degradation are best seen as the result of particular historical and political processes and not simply as the results of particular patterns of behaviour that are culturally driven. These processes, given primary impetus by massive population influx onto a restricted land base and combined with the peculiarities of differential access to resources and the need to preserve the interests of elite groups, have forced sectors of the South African population into situations where physical survival has necessarily had grave environmental cost. One of the consequences of apartheid policies has been to institutionalise environmental degradation in particular areas of the country...|$|R
40|$|Formatively and artistically aspect, {{a hybrid}} {{can be said}} to be a {{phenomenon}} in which two mutually different genres are combined. Make-up is thought to be very important to arrange the foundation available for predicting and pursuing a flow and direction of future hybrid make-up based on this, by analyzing a flow centering on hybrid trend, which was shown previously. In terms of objectives of this study, the first, aim is to suggest a model for researching make-up by grasping the developmental process and the characteristics of hybrid art through considering an art theory of hybridity, shown in make-up. The second, aim is to design make-up by analyzing trends in make-up style after deconstructing the hybrid genre. The modern make-up design through genre-deconstruction characteristics beyond diverse plurality and genre could be known to be highlighted as aesthetic characteristic by a slight attempt as communication of open space, which connects culture and genre, which had failed to be recognized and was neglected. Empirical research has, produced a work by systematically arranging make-up design. This study, identifies two kind of barrier demolition, such as the class deconstruction and the temporal, spatial disorder centering on genre deconstruction of hybrid. There are infinite possibilities in developing <b>make-up</b> design in <b>line</b> with modern sensation through aesthetic element and symbolic significance through genre deconstruction.
