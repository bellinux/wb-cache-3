The parametric analysis indicates that the magnetic peaks also arise in both 2 D and 3 D high beta cases (β∥ ⪆ 1) as shown by the Cluster observations. In the high beta cases, the high mobility of the protons helps continuous coalescence of the diamagnetic currents inside the <b>magnetic</b> <b>dips.</b> The coalescence makes the <b>magnetic</b> <b>dips</b> larger and shallower. Between the large and shallow <b>magnetic</b> <b>dips,</b> the <b>magnetic</b> peaks appear in the high beta cases.

The onset of this instability, called torus instability, {{is one of the}} main mechanisms that can initiate coronal mass ejections. Since flux ropes often possess <b>magnetic</b> <b>dips</b> that can support prominence plasma, this is also a valuable mechanism to trigger prominence eruptions. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the formation and/or emergence of MFRs suggest a critical value for the onset of the instability in the range [1. 4 − 2]. However, detailed observations of prominences suggest a value in the range [0. 9 − 1. 1]. In this Letter, by using a set of MHD simulations, we show why the large discrepancy between models and observations is only apparent. Our simulations indeed show that the critical decay index at the onset of the eruption is = n 1. 4 0. 1 when computed at the apex of the flux rope axis, while it is = n 1. 1 0. 1 when it is computed at the altitude of the topmost part of the distribution of <b>magnetic</b> <b>dips.</b> The discrepancy only arises because weakly twisted curved flux ropes do not have dips up to the altitude of their axis...|$|R

40|$|Aims. We analyze {{distributions}} {{of the magnetic}} field strength and prominence plasma (temperature, pressure, plasma beta, and mass) using the 3 D whole-prominence fine structure model. Methods. The model combines a 3 D magnetic field configuration of an entire prominence, obtained from non-linear force-free field simulations, with a detailed semi-empirically derived description of the prominence plasma. The plasma is located in <b>magnetic</b> <b>dips</b> in hydrostatic equilibrium and is distributed along multiple fine structures within the 3 D magnetic model. Results. We show that in the modeled prominence, the variations of the magnetic field strength and its orientation are insignificant on scales comparable to the smallest dimensions of the observed prominence fine structures.

This provides new insights into the composition of the prominence-corona transition region. We further demonstrate that the values of the plasma beta are small throughout the majority of the modeled prominence when realistic photospheric magnetic flux distributions and prominence plasma parameters are assumed. While this is generally true, we also find that in the region with the deepest <b>magnetic</b> <b>dips,</b> the plasma beta may increase towards unity. Finally, we show that the mass of the modeled prominence plasma is in good agreement with the mass of observed non-eruptive prominences. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{filament}} {{are commonly}} {{thought to be}} supported in <b>magnetic</b> <b>dips,</b> in particular, of magnetic flux ropes (FRs). In this Letter, from the observed photospheric vector magnetogram, we implement a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation of a coronal magnetic FR that supports a large-scale intermediate filament between an active region and a weak polarity region. This result {{is the first in}} that current NLFFF extrapolations with presence of FRs are limited to relatively small-scale filaments that are close to sunspots and along main polarity inversion line (PIL) with strong transverse field and magnetic shear, and the existence of a FR is usually predictable. In contrast, the present filament lies along the weak-field region (photospheric field strength ≲ 100 G), where the PIL is very fragmented due to small parasitic polarities on both side of the PIL and the transverse field has a low value of signal-to-noise ratio. Thus it represents a far more difficult challenge to extrapolate a large-scale FR in such case. We demonstrate that our CESE [...] MHD [...] NLFFF code is competent for the challenge. The numerically reproduced <b>magnetic</b> <b>dips</b> of the extrapolated FR match observations of the filament and its barbs very well, which supports strongly the FR-dip model for filaments. The filament is stably sustained because the FR is weakly twisted and strongly confined by the overlying closed arcades. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, to be appeared on ApJ...|$|R

Here, therefore, currents of electricity were produced by the direct inductive power of the earth's magnetism, without the use of any ferruginous matter, and upon a metal not capable of exhibiting any of the ordinary magnetic phenomena.

Several hours later, the condensation has grown into a structure connecting the prominence-corona transition region with the underlying transition region, and a continuous downward motion from the accumulated mass represents a drainage that matches observational findings. A more dynamic phase is found as well, with coronal rain, induced wave trains, and even a reconnection event when the core prominence plasma weighs down the fieldlines until a fluxrope gets formed.

Our simulation is a magnetohydrodynamic simulation including anisotropic thermal conduction, optically thin radiative losses, and parametrised heating as main thermodynamical features to construct a realistic arcade configuration from chromospheric to coronal heights. The plasma evaporation from chromospheric and transition region heights eventually causes localised runaway condensation events and we witness the formation of plasma blobs due to thermal instability, that evolve dynamically in the heated arcade part and move gradually downwards due to interchange type dynamics. Unlike earlier 2. 5 D simulations, in this case there is no large scale prominence formation observed, but a continuous coronal rain develops which shows clear indications of Rayleigh-Taylor or interchange instability, that causes the denser plasma located above the transition region to fall down, as the system moves towards a more stable state. Linear stability analysis is used in the non-linear regime for gaining insight and giving a prediction of the system's evolution.

Many previous theoretical studies of flux emergence use a twisted cylindrical tube in the solar interior as the initial condition. Important insights can be gained from this model, however, it does have shortcomings. The axis of the tube never fully emerges as dense plasma becomes trapped in <b>magnetic</b> <b>dips</b> and restrains its ascent. Also, since the entire tube is buoyant, the main photospheric footpoints (sunspots) continually drift apart. These problems {{make it difficult to}} produce a convincing sunspot pair. We aim to address these problems by considering a different initial condition, namely a toroidal flux tube. Methods. We perform numerical experiments and solve the 3 D MHD equations. The dynamics are investigated through a range of initial field strengths and twists. Results. The experiments demonstrate that the emergence of toroidal flux tubes is highly dynamic and exhibits a rich variety of behaviour. In answer to the aims, however, if the initial field strength is strong enough, the axis of the tube can fully emerge. Also, the sunspot pair does not continually drift apart. Instead, its maximum separation is the diameter of the original toroidal tube. </p...|$|R

In this Letter, we address the long-standing problem of how the neutral component of the plasma in prominences is supported against gravity. Using the multiple fluid approach we solve the time-dependent equations in two dimensions considering the frictional coupling between the neutral and ionized components of the magnetized plasma representative of a solar prominence embedded in a hot coronal environment. We demonstrate that given an initial density enhancement in the two fluids, representing the body of the prominence, the system is able to relax in the vicinity of <b>magnetic</b> <b>dips</b> to a stationary state in which both neutrals and ionized species are dynamically suspended above the photosphere. Two different coupling processes are considered in this study, collisions between ions and neutrals and charge exchange interactions. We find that for realistic conditions ions are essentially static while neutrals have a very small downflow velocity. The coupling between ions and neutrals is so strong at the prominence body that the behavior {{is similar to that of}} a single fluid with an effective density equal to the sum of the ion and neutral species. We also find that the charge exchange mechanism is about three times more efficient sustaining neutrals than elastic scattering of ions with neutrals. Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ...|$|R

We measure the photospheric vector {{magnetic field}} in several small flux concentrations surrounding a filament observed far from disc center. Our objective is to test for the presence/absence of <b>magnetic</b> <b>dips</b> around/below the filament body/barb, which is a strong constraint on prominence models, and that is still untested by observations. Methods. Our observations are performed with the THEMIS/MTR instrument. The four Stokes parameters are extracted, from which the vector magnetic fields are calculated using a PCA inversion. The resulting vector fields are then deprojected onto the photospheric plane. The 180 ◦ ambiguity is then solved by selecting the only solution that matches filament chirality rules. Considering the weakness of the resulting magnetic fields, a careful analysis of the inversion procedure and its error bars was performed, to avoid over-interpretation of noisy or ambiguous Stokes profiles. Thanks to the simultaneous multi-wavelength THEMIS observations, the vector field maps are coaligned with the Hα image of the filament. Results.
