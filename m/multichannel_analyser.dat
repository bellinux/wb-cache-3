40|$|AIM [...] To {{investigate}} {{the waste of}} laboratory reagents which resulted from the process of ordering biochemistry profiles. METHODS [...] The frequency of measurement of 15 analytes was recorded during the {{six months before the}} introduction of a system of discretionary requesting and analysis of samples (high capacity <b>multichannel</b> discrete <b>analyser),</b> and also during the same six month period one year and two years after its introduction. RESULTS [...] The frequency of measurement of 10 of the 15 analytes decreased during the six month period one year after the change to discretionary testing. The remaining five analytes were measured up to 22 % more frequently. There was an overall decrease in the measurement of biochemical tests by 31, 359. This created an annual cost saving of 7124 pounds. In the second year five analytes still continued to be measured less frequently than originally but the remaining 10 analytes were measured more frequently. This resulted in an overall increase in the measurement of biochemical tests by 53, 678 compared with the six month period before discretionary analysis. The pattern of requests was similar during both periods of discretionary requesting studied and as a result, a small annual cost saving of 1672 pounds was again made. CONCLUSION [...] Discretionary requesting and analysis of tests may eliminate the measurement of clinically unnecessary test which had previously resulted from the processes of ordering tests.

Photons of a wavelength 228. 8 nm resulting from the decay of the 51 P 1 state were detected in a direction perpendicular to the scattering plane and analysed for either linear or circular polarization.

40|$|Obtaining a good {{signal-to-noise}} ratio (S/N) {{is of great}} importance in tunneling spectroscopy, as it has often led {{to the discovery of}} new phenomena. The quantities of interest are the derivatives of the tunnel junction I-V curve; the usual approach to obtain these characteristics is to apply a modulation voltage around a D. C. bias and to detect the proper harmonic with a lock-in detector. In order to improve the S/N ratio, one would think of increasing the detector time-constant (and total sweep time), but experimentalists know that, above a few seconds, such an increase is illusive and even misleading. This is because there are low frequency instabilities in the equipment, but also because there is noise present in the junction characteristic itself. The combined use of a lock-in detector and a <b>multichannel</b> <b>analyser</b> is proposed, in order to average a large number (n) of short sweeps instead of using one single long sweep. The S/N ratio is calculated for such an experiment, and it is found that it depends strongly upon the noise spectral density. For a 1 /f spectrum a large improvement (n) is obtained with respect to the usual method, for the same total experimental duration. A system for adapting a commercial multichannel to the plotting of junction characteristics is described, and experiments are performed that demonstrate the advantages of this method.

40|$|Nowadays one of {{the most}} {{complicated}} challenges for Nuclear Industry is to ensure a safe and efficient decommissioning of nuclear facilities. With the term decommissioning we usually describe the process, {{at the end of life}} of facility, starting after the defueling and coolant removal. One of the most relevant activities related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities is the radiological characterisation. With the term “radiological characterisation” we define all operation to determinate the type, location and concentration of radionuclides. Radiological characterisation, together with clearance levels, allows minimizing the radiological hazards the waste volume and costs of decommissioning. In these last years many efforts have been carried out to improve the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in particular in the decommissioning field. Sometimes we have to face the characterization of unknown and hazardous environments because of the lack of recorded data, in case of experimental facilities where took place different experiments at the beginning of nuclear industry or simply we have to decommissioning facility that was not designed with the aim of future decommissioning (presence of activated material,place difficult to reach or waste disposed without characterization or engineering barriers).
