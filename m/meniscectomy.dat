50|$|They {{were once}} {{thought of as}} vestigial {{structures}} that served no real purpose. If injured and problematic, they were routinely excised through a procedure called <b>meniscectomy.</b> It is now known that a knee joint without healthy menisci is at significantly increased risk of developing wear and tear arthritis (post-traumatic or osteoarthritis). The arthritis {{is a result of}} the increased contact forces and shear that results from loss of shock absorption and stability after <b>meniscectomy.</b> For this reason, current surgical strategies are focused on preserving as much of the meniscus as possible or replacing it if necessary.|$|E
50|$|There {{are around}} 200,000 ACL tears {{each year in}} the United States, with over 100,000 ACL {{reconstruction}} surgeries per year. Over 95% of ACL reconstructions are performed in the outpatient setting. The most common procedures performed during ACL reconstruction are partial <b>meniscectomy</b> and chondroplasty.|$|E
50|$|If the {{destroyed}} {{part of the}} meniscus was removed, {{patients can}} usually start walking using a crutch {{a day or two}} after surgery. Although each case is different, patients return to their normal activities on average after a few weeks (2 or 3). Still, a completely normal walk will resume gradually, and it's not unusual to take 2-3 months for the recovery to reach a level where a patient will walk totally smoothly. Many <b>meniscectomy</b> patients don't ever feel a 100% functional recovery, but even years after the procedure they sometimes feel tugging or tension in a part of their knee. There is little medical follow-up after <b>meniscectomy</b> and official medical documentation tends to ignore the imperfections and side-effects of this procedure.|$|E
30|$|The {{meniscus}} plays {{a decisive}} {{role for the}} integrity of the knee joint. It includes shock absorption and transmission, but also joint stabilization and proprioception as well as lubrication and nutrition of the articular cartilage (Makris et al., 2011). Intervention on the meniscus, in particular partial <b>meniscectomies,</b> {{are one of the most}} frequently performed operative orthopaedic procedures and underline the impact of this subject. Biomechanical studies have shown that a loss of the meniscus integrity leads to a marked change in kinematics and load distribution in the knee joint. The pressure on the surrounding native articular cartilage subsequently increases. Even a resection of 15 – 34 % of the meniscus tissue additionally enhances the load on the hyaline cartilage up to 350 % (Radin et al., 1984).|$|R

50|$|Two {{surgeries}} of the meniscus {{are most}} common. Depending {{on the type}} and location of the tear, the patient's age, and physician's preference, injured menisci are usually either repaired or removed, in part or completely (<b>meniscectomy).</b> Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Many studies show the meniscus serves a purpose and therefore doctors will attempt to repair when possible. However, the meniscus has poor blood supply, and, therefore, healing can be difficult. Traditionally {{it was thought that}} if there is no chance of healing, then it is best to remove the damaged and non-functional meniscus, although at least one study has shown that there is little significance if a <b>meniscectomy</b> is done. However, resuming high intensity activities may be impossible without surgery as the tear may flap around, causing the knee to lock.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of meniscal tears are {{not suitable for}} repair and instead the torn piece is removed, known as a <b>meniscectomy.</b> The torn portion of the meniscus is cut and sucked out of the joint, leaving behind as much normal meniscal cartilage as possible.

30|$|Meniscal lesions {{were found}} in 28 % of the adoelscents at BL and FU, and in 56 and 61 % of the adults at BL and FU, respectively. Soder et al. found no meniscal lesions in {{asymptomatic}} adolescent soccer players; however, {{this may be because}} they utilized low-field MRI (0.35 -T), which is less sensitive than the high-field unit (1.5 -T) utilized in this study to detect such lesions. Previous studies have had mixed findings of the prevalence of meniscal lesions in adult athletes, including 0 % in varsity college basketball players (Major and Helms 2002), 20 % in professional basketball players (Kaplan et al. 2005), and 58 % in professional football players (Reinig et al. 1991). The high prevalence found in our adult cohort is largely attributable to the fact that 5 adults (28 %) had prior meniscectomies; excluding those cases, 28 and 33 % of adults had meniscal lesions at BL and FU, which is comparable to past findings. The greater severity of meniscal lesions in adults than in adolescents is also likely due to the high rate of <b>meniscectomies</b> in that age group. Meniscal lesions have been shown to lead to early-stage knee OA (Englund et al. 2009), so future studies should assess whether meniscal lesions in adolescent and adult athletes correlate with OA in the long-term.|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{developments}} {{have occurred in}} meniscal surgery, and consequently in the imaging of post-operative menisci, over the last 15 years. A drive to preserve meniscal physiologic function {{for as long as}} possible, in order to delay osteoarthrosis, has resulted in limited partial <b>meniscectomies,</b> meniscal repairs and meniscal transplants. Each of these techniques affects the imaging appearance of the meniscus, reducing the accuracy of conventional MRI in predicting recurrent tears. The specificity of conventional MRI can be improved by employing at least two T 2 -weighted sequences, but this still leaves a shortfall in sensitivity. In an attempt to increase the diagnostic accuracy of cross-sectional imaging, MR arthrography (MRA) and CT arthrography (CTA), have been applied to the post-operative meniscus. Sensitivities and specificities for these two techniques approach 90 % in predicting recurrent meniscal tears. In the setting of clinical symptoms and gross meniscal deficiency, meniscal allografts are being transplanted with increasing frequency. In these transplants meniscal degeneration, fragmentation and separation are common findings, but the role of imaging in the management of these patients has not yet been well defined.

5000|$|Certain meniscal {{tears are}} {{repairable}} with sutures, predominantly {{those that are}} freshly torn and involve healthy tissue. [...] The closer tear is to the peripheral blood supply the higher the likelihood of successful repair. [...] Patients with unrepairable meniscal injuries usually have symptoms of pain, catching, swelling or locking in the knee. [...] The surgeon may perform a partial or complete <b>meniscectomy</b> to alleviate the symptoms in the short-term. The more meniscal tissue removed, the higher the likelihood of subsequently developing arthritis.

5000|$|If {{the injury}} to the {{meniscus}} is isolated, then the knee would be relatively stable. However, if another injury such as an anterior cruciate ligament injury (torn ACL) was coupled with a torn meniscus, then an arthroscopy would be performed.A meniscal repair has a higher success rate {{if there is an}} adequate blood supply to the peripheral rim. The interior of the meniscus is avascular, but the blood supply can penetrate up to about 6 millimeters or a quarter inch. Therefore, meniscus tears that occur near the peripheral rim are able to heal after a meniscal repair. A study conducted by Heckman, Barber-Westin & Noyes found that it is better to repair the meniscus than rather remove it (<b>meniscectomy).</b> The amount of rehabilitation time required for a repair is longer than a <b>meniscectomy,</b> but removing the meniscus can cause osteoarthritis problems. If the meniscus is removed, the patient will be in rehab for about four to six weeks. If a repair is conducted, then the patient will need four to six months.If physical therapy does not resolve the symptoms, or in cases of a locked knee, then surgical intervention may be required. Depending on the location of the tear, a repair may be possible. In the outer third of the meniscus, an adequate blood supply exists and a repair will likely heal. Usually younger patients are more resilient and respond well to this treatment, while older, more sedentary patients do not have a favorable outcome after a repair."There's potential harm of the operation, and there's some data to suggest it might increase progression of the disease and lead to earlier joint replacement." ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the use of a novel hyaluronic acid/polycaprolactone material for meniscal tissue engineering and to evaluate the tissue regeneration after the augmentation of the implant with expanded autologous chondrocytes. Two different surgical implantation techniques in a sheep model were evaluated. Methods: Twenty-four skeletally mature sheep were treated with total medial meniscus replacements, while two <b>meniscectomies</b> served as empty controls. The animals were divided into two groups: cell-free scaffold and scaffold seeded with autologous chondrocytes. Two different surgical techniques were compared: in 12 animals, the implant was sutured to the capsule and to the meniscal ligament; in the other 12 animals, also a transtibial fixation of the horns was used. The animals were euthanized after 4 months. The specimens were assessed by gross inspection and histology. Results: All implants showed excellent capsular ingrowth at the periphery. Macroscopically, no difference was observed between cell-seeded and cell-free groups. Better implant appearance and integrity was observed in the group without transosseous horns fixation. Using the latter implantation technique, lower joint degeneration was observed in the cell-seeded group with respect to cell-free implants. The histological analysis indicated cellular infiltration and vascularization throughout the implanted constructs. Cartilaginous tissue formation was significantly more frequent in the cell-seeded constructs. Conclusion: The current study supports the potential of a novel HYAFF/polycaprolactone scaffold for total meniscal substitution.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} whether anatomic {{restoration of the}} anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) functional bundles results in significant reduction in transverse-plane instability compared with the conventional single-bundle technique during a dynamic 60 pivoting maneuver with the supporting knee in extension. Methods: Using an 8 -camera optoelectronic system and a force plate, we examined 10 patients with double-bundle ACL reconstruction, 12 patients with single-bundle reconstruction, 10 ACL-deficient subjects, and 10 healthy control individuals. The 4 {{groups did not differ}} in terms of age, body mass index, duration of follow-up, and number of <b>meniscectomies</b> performed. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected from these subjects while performing a pivoting maneuver on each side with the supporting knee in extension. Maximum range of motion for internal-external knee rotation and maximum knee rotational moment were examined. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} tibial rotation either between the 4 groups or between sides. The mean knee rotation for the single-and double-bundle groups was lower than the control group. Rotational moment values were substantially reduced on the affected side of the reconstructed and the ACL-deficient groups. However, rotational moment was not found to affect the degree of angular displacement significantly. Conclusions: Double-bundle ACL reconstruction does not reduce knee rotation further compared with the single-bundle reconstruction technique.

40|$|Background: While the {{clinical}} value of routine pathologic examination of tissues removed during orthopaedic proce-dures {{has not been}} determined, limited cost-effectiveness and a low prevalence of findings that alter patient management have been previously demonstrated with arthroscopy. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine {{the clinical}} value and cost-effectiveness of routine histological examination of knee arthroscopy specimens. Methods: Retrospective chart analysis of 3797 consecutive knee arthroscopies by two surgeons from 2004 to 2013 at three affiliated hospitals within one health-care system was undertaken. Pathology reports regarding tissue removed during partial <b>meniscectomies</b> and anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were reviewed to determine if the results altered patient care. The total costs of histological examination were estimated in 2012 -adjusted U. S. dollars. The cost per health effect was determined by calculating the cost per discrepant and discordant diagnosis. Results: The prevalence of concordant diagnoses was 99. 3 % (3769 of 3797), the prevalence of discrepant diagnoses was 0. 7 % (twenty-seven of 3797), and the prevalence of discordant diagnoses was 0. 026 % (one of 3797). The total cost of histological examinations was estimated to be $ 371, 810. The total cost of the pathology cost per discrepant diagnosis was $ 13, 771, and the cost per discordant diagnosis was $ 371, 810.
