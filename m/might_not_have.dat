5|$|In 1909, {{the sons}} of Frederick Law Olmsted, {{landscape}} architect for Central Park in New York, Carey and Frederick, Jr. were asked to design the park's master plan while they were at work on Grant Park.

5|$|Bache's {{strategy}} for presenting these works {{was one of}} familiarity. He performed two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works prior to the debuts of the original versions, and performed some of Liszt's symphonic poems shortly after they had been premiered at the Crystal Palace. He also provided informative, scholarly program notes, written by leading musical analysts and intimates in the Liszt circle. The English musical press, while generally hostile to the music he presented, noted and appreciated Bache's efforts. Liszt remained grateful; without Bache, he acknowledged, his music <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> gained the foothold that it did.|$|E

Between 2004 and 2012, his lawyers submitted several unsuccessful applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

5|$|Confusion arose when {{an issue}} of the French daily {{newspaper}} Le Petit Journal, published on 24 July 1904 {{on the occasion of}} the bey of Tunis's visit to France, reproduced an illustration showing the flag used while was visiting the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. Ivan Sache of Flags of the World claimed that this flag design, which hadn't been seen earlier, may have been inaccurate, suggesting that the journalist <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been at the affair or he had reproduced a drawing of the wrong flag.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{when the}} Sisters of Death arrived in Mega-City One, they found Kraken there instead of Dredd.

They noted that other planets discovered using radial velocity measurements <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> accounted {{for the possibility that}} their host stars were binary systems; the only way that this was definitely known in the case of Kepler-14 was through the use of high-resolution imaging. If the less prominent portion of the Kepler-14 binary system had not been detected, Kepler-14b's mass would have been incorrect by nearly 60%, and its radius too small by about 10%.|$|E
5|$|The {{extinction}} {{of the dinosaurs}} {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period is generally thought to have been caused by the Cretaceous–Paleogene impact event, which created the Chicxulub crater, demonstrating that impacts are a serious threat to life on Earth. Astronomers have speculated that without Jupiter to mop up potential impactors, extinction events might have been more frequent on Earth, and complex life <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been able to develop. This is part of the argument used in the Rare Earth hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Whatever {{the basis}} for Manetho's choice to end the Fifth Dynasty with Unas, Egyptians living at the time {{probably}} perceived no particular change from one dynasty to the next. The administration of the state shows no evidence of disturbances, with many officials continuing their careers from Unas' onto Teti's reign. These include the viziers Mehu, Kagemni and Nikau-Isesi and the overseer of the province of Edfu Isi. Given that the Egyptians of the Old Kingdom <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> conceived of dynasties, {{the distinction between the}} Fifth and Sixth Dynasties might be illusory.|$|E

There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
5|$|Brian Horrocks was {{the only}} son of Colonel Sir William Horrocks, a doctor in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Born in India, Brian {{returned}} to Britain, where he was educated at Bow School, Durham, later Uppingham School, Rutland, an English public school, and entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1913. His score was sixth-lowest of the 167 successful applicants for cadetships—even after the addition of 200 bonus points for an Officer Training Corps (OTC) certificate, which not all the other candidates had. An unpromising student, he <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> received a commission at all but for {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in August 1914.|$|E

5|$|Campbell was unapologetic. He {{said that}} he {{considered}} it his duty as president to attend the game. Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau was livid at Campbell for attending, and he laid {{the blame for the}} riot on Campbell. A Montreal city councilor wanted Campbell arrested for inciting the riot. Years later, Canadiens player Jean Béliveau stated that, although he disagreed with Campbell's decision to attend the game, as well as feeling Campbell might have been using his appearance to make a statement, he concluded that Campbell may have felt that if he did not attend he could appear to be hiding. He also noted that Campbell's absence <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> made much of a difference.|$|E
5|$|Like {{several other}} chalk figures {{carved into the}} English countryside, the Cerne Abbas Giant is often thought of as an ancient creation. However, as {{with many of the}} other figures, its history cannot be traced back further than the late 17th century, making an origin during the Celtic, Roman or even Early Medieval periods {{difficult}} to demonstrate. Medieval sources refer to the hill on which the giant is located as Trendle Hill – possibly in reference to the nearby landmark known as the Trendle. Joseph Bettey noted that none of the earlier sources for the area, including a detailed 1617 land survey, refer to the giant, suggesting that it <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been there at the time. In contrast, the Uffington White Horse {{has been shown to be}} 3,000 years old, and there are references to it across the ages.|$|E
5|$|Some critics, {{among them}} Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have {{wondered}} {{what would have}} happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not write his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write Romeo. How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run is another matter. He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at orchestration, to the thorough grounding in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at the Conservatory. Without that grounding, Tchaikovsky <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been able to write what would become his greatest works.|$|E

5|$|Speyer's two {{principal}} legacies {{are the three}} deep-level tube lines of the London Underground, and the Promenade Concerts. The former <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been built without the finance he raised with Yerkes, and would have struggled without his chairmanship. The latter may have failed in the early 20th century without his financial support. The tube lines now form the central sections of the Underground's Northern, Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines. After Speyer's funding of the Promenade Concerts ended, they were taken over by music publishers Chappell & Co. and, in 1927, by the BBC. The characters of Sir Hermann and Lady Aline Gurtner in E. F. Benson's 1919 novel Robin Linnet were based on Sir Edgar and Lady Speyer. Leanne Langley suggests that the character of Appleton, a villainous stockbroker, in John Buchan's The Thirty-Nine Steps may {{have been based on}} Speyer.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{initially}} {{thought the}} center <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{been at the}} surface, and the agency indicated low forecasting confidence, as they could not determine a circulation center. The difficulty arose from the large, sprawling nature of the storm, and by later on May 27 a new center formed, as confirmed by radar imagery and the Hurricane Hunters. That night, the extremely small center made landfall just south of Savannah, Georgia, affecting a very small area with winds of 65mph (100km/h) and a minimum pressure of 991 mbar (hPa; 29.26 inHg). Around the time of landfall, Alpha developed a warm core, indicating some tropical characteristics. The storm weakened quickly over land, although it did not dissipate until two days later over the northeast Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year LeMond began the 1994 Tour de France but found {{he was unable}} to race effectively. He had to abandon after the first week before the race had reached the difficult mountain stages. That December he announced his retirement. At the time the reasons for LeMond's increasing difficulties were not entirely known. At a loss, he speculated that a condition known as mitochondrial myopathy might be responsible for the difficulty he was having performing against the current riders. In 2007, however, LeMond speculated that he <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> had the condition after all, and suggested that lead toxicity from the shotgun pellets still embedded in his body might have been responsible, the effects of which were increased by heavy training.|$|E
