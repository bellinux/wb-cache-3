40|$|Abstract. To {{cope with}} the {{difficulty}} of <b>MRI</b> <b>brain</b> <b>scans</b> automatic segmentation, we need to constrain and control the selection and the adjustment of processing tools depending on the local image characteristics. To extract domain and control knowledge from the image, we propose to use situated cooperative agents whose dedicated behavior, i. e. segmentation of one type of tissue, is dynamically adapted {{with respect to their}} position in the image. Qualitative maps are used as a common framework to represent knowledge. Constraints that drive the agents behavior, based on topographic relationships and radiometric information, are gradually gained and refined during the segmentation progress. Incremental refinement of the segmentation is obtained through the combination, distribution and opposition of solutions concurrently proposed by the agents, via respectively three types of cooperation: integrative, augmentative and confrontational. We report in detail our multi-agent approach and results obtained on <b>MRI</b> <b>brain</b> <b>scans.</b> ...|$|R

Similarly, raised CSF protein levels and pleocytosis are frequent but non-specific.

5000|$|The present {{case series}} with two {{patients}} explored whether virtual reality (VR) distraction could reduce claustrophobia symptoms during a mock {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (<b>MRI)</b> <b>brain</b> <b>scan.</b> Two patients who met DSM-IV criteria for specific phobia, situational type (i.e., claustrophobia) reported high levels of anxiety during a mock 10-min MRI procedure with no VR, and asked to terminate the scan early. The patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either VR or music distraction for their second scan attempt. When immersed in an illusory three-dimensional (3D) virtual world named SnowWorld, patient 1 was able to complete a 10-min mock scan with low anxiety and reported an increase in self-efficacy afterwards. Patient 2 received [...] "music only" [...] distraction during her second scan but was still not able to complete a 10-min scan and asked to terminate her second scan early.

50|$|Alcoholics often {{present with}} smaller brain volumes which is {{probably}} due to alcohol induced neurotoxicity. Impairments in impulse control in binge drinkers, which is more prominent in female binge drinkers, is due to dysfunction of the frontal lobe. The findings in humans have been largely concordant with animal studies. Such animal studies find that heavy and regular binge drinking causes neurodegeneration in corticolimbic brain regions areas which are involved in learning and spatial memory, such as the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, perirhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampal dentate gyrus. A study in rats found that a heavy 2-day drinking binge caused extensive neurodegeneration in the entorhinal cortex with resultant learning deficits. While brain damage from binge drinking is known to occur {{as a result of}} binge drinking patterns, it is unclear how long drinking sessions last and how regular binge drinking is done to cause brain damage in humans. One study found that humans who drank at least 100 drinks (male) or 80 drinks (female) per month (concentrated to 21 occasions or less per month) throughout a 3-year period had impaired decision making skills compared to non-binge drinkers. In the same study, an <b>MRI</b> <b>brain</b> <b>scan</b> found that levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) which is a metabolite biomarker for neural integrity was lower in binge drinkers and additionally found that brain metabolism was abnormal and found loss of white brain matter in the frontal lobe and higher parietal gray matter NAA.

40|$|Abstract. Image {{interpretation}} {{consists in}} finding a correspondence between radiometric information and symbolic labelling with respect to specific spatial constraints. To cope with the difficulty of image interpretation, several information processing steps are required to gradually extract information from the image grey levels and to introduce symbolic information. In this paper, we evaluate the use of situated cooperative agents {{as a framework for}} managing such steps. Dedicated agent behaviours are dynamically adapted function of their position in the image, topographic relationships and radiometric information available. Acquired knowledge is diffused to acquaintance and incremental refinement of interpretation is obtained through focalisation and coordination of agents tasks.

The two mechanisms are evaluated through application to a set of MRI scans describing musicians and non-musicians. In both cases a high degree of accuracy is obtained. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) {{in children}} is a demyelinating disease of a central nervous system (CNS), whose clinical symptoms and results of imagining examinations differ from those found in adults, and therefore requires different criteria of diagnosis. The method of choice in MS imaging in children is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The {{purpose of this study}} was to present the characteristics of paediatric MS in <b>MRI</b> <b>brain</b> <b>scan.</b> Material/Methods: MRI brain scans of 20 children aged 11 - 17 with diagnosed MS were analyzed. The compliance of MRI brain scans with KIDMUS criteria from 2008 was stated along with the location and morphology of plaques of demyelination. Results: In the examined group all three KIDMUS criteria required for MS diagnosis were met by 45 % of children, and two criteria by 50 % of children. The average size of the demyelination plaque was 9 mm. Giant foci were not observed.
