On either side of the center are the guards (G), while tackles (T) line up outside the guards.|$|E
5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E

5|$|The {{story and}} cut scene {{animations}} were created in-house. The plot was originally written by Fox, {{who had also}} written most of the Sly Cooper stories, and reviewed by Fleming. As they continued to develop the game, they rewrote pieces of the story to reflect changes in the game, <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> story remained enjoyable. As the game became more complex, they brought in Bill Harms, a published comic book author, who had previously written for Supreme Commander and other video games. Harms assisted with the story and in-game dialog in addition to marketing materials. Fleming noted that {{the second half of}} the story underwent significant changes in the last nine months of development; for example, when voice actor Caleb Moody voiced the lines for Zeke, he ad libbed additional lines that the team found to be enjoyable, and they reworked the story to incorporate them. The cut scenes were created in a similar format to the comics that the game was influenced by, and used to further extend the atmosphere of the superhero motif. The cut scenes were created by taking 2D art created in Corel Painter and Adobe Photoshop and placing them into artificial 3D stages built in Adobe After Effects to create a pseudo-3D effect that allowed them to play with camera placement and effects, and addition of organic elements such as dust clouds and ink spots.|$|E

25|$|There {{is limited}} {{information}} on overdose with ofloxacin.

Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is of only limited effectiveness. Overdose may result in central nervous system toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, tendon/articular toxicity, and hepatic toxicity as well as renal failure and seizure. Seizures have however, been reported to occur at therapeutic dosage as well as severe psychiatric reactions.|$|E
25|$|If {{the rate}} of {{absorption}} (and/or excretion) of certain nutrients can be experimentally measured then this information can be added as a constraint on the flux rate {{at the edges of}} a metabolic model. This ensures that nutrients that are not present or not absorbed by the organism do not enter its metabolism (the flux rate is constrained to zero) and also means that known nutrient uptake rates are adhered to by the simulation. This provides a secondary method of <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> simulated metabolism has experimentally verified properties rather than just mathematically acceptable ones.|$|E

25|$|Irish {{immigration}} {{was opposed}} in the 1850s by the nativist Know Nothing movement, originating in New York in 1843.

On March 14, 1891, a lynch mob stormed a local jail and lynched several Italians following the acquittal of several Sicilian immigrants alleged {{to be involved in the}} murder of New Orleans police chief David Hennessy. The Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act in 1921, followed by the Immigration Act of 1924.

25|$|In November 1758, another {{petition}} {{was sent}} to Thomas Pownall, requesting that Timothy be allowed to purchase another 350 acres of the Stockbridges' land.

25|$|Democrats {{support a}} more {{progressive}} tax structure {{to provide more}} services and reduce economic inequality by <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wealthiest Americans pay the highest amount in taxes. Democrats support more government spending on social services while spending less on the military. They oppose the cutting of social services, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and various other welfare programs, believing it to be harmful to efficiency and social justice. Democrats believe the benefits of social services, in monetary and non-monetary terms, are a more productive labor force and cultured population, and believe {{that the benefits of}} this are greater than any benefits that could be derived from lower taxes, especially on top earners, or cuts to social services. Furthermore, Democrats see social services as essential towards providing positive freedom, i.e. freedom derived from economic opportunity.
