40|$|Aim of this {{contribution}} is {{to investigate the}} relevance of the layout on the performance of floating breakwater schemes under oblique waves. An experimental investigation was carried out in the wave basin of the Maritime Laboratory of Padua University, Italy. The facility dimensions are 3. 8 m × 20. 6 m × 0. 8 m. Several regular and irregular longcrested waves were generated and two different layouts (I- and J-shaped) and three obliquities (0 °, 30 °, 60 °) were tested. With increasing wave obliquity, wave transmission decreases, <b>mooring</b> forces <b>due</b> to snapping decrease and link forces slightly increase. The J-shaped configuration determines basically the same effects with regards to both transmission and loads. The maxima of link forces are not much greater than the average loads and this is relevant for fatigue and reliability considerations...|$|R

As rates of habitat and ecosystem destruction continue to rise, the need for proper understanding, conserving and up-to-date inventories become a very sensitive issue and of utmost importance (Wilson, 1998). Therefore, vegetation mapping and classification is needed to generate accurate and timely information of upland <b>moors.</b> However, <b>due</b> to the extent and remoteness of uplands, manual survey is difficult.

50|$|The Tralee Ship Canal {{was built}} to {{accommodate}} larger ships sailing into Tralee as the quay in Blennerville was becoming unpractical to use due to silting, while merchants in Tralee were not satisfied with its facilities {{at the start of}} the 19th century. The House of Commons authorised an Act of Parliament in June 1829 for the canal with work beginning in 1832. Issues with funding meant that the canal was not completed until 1846 when it was opened to ships. The canal was 2 miles long in length with a new canal basin built in Tralee, lock gates and a wooden swing bridge constructed in Blennerville. Large ships of up to 300 tonnes could navigate the canal but not long after the canal opened it too began to suffer from silting. By the 1880s Fenit harbour was built which was a deep water harbour and did not suffer from silting. A railway was constructed soon afterwards between Fenit and Tralee carrying cargo and freight from ships <b>moored</b> there. <b>Due</b> to silting the canal fell into disuse and neglect, and was closed in 1951.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{concerns}} experimental {{measurements of}} the interaction of a taut moored floating body, representing a wave energy converter in survivability mode, with extreme waves. Focussed wave groups, based initially on NewWave theory, are used to generate the extreme waves, with crest amplitude exceeding the mooring׳s design capacity. Two data sets are presented and discussed. In the first the influence of wave steepness on model response and mooring load is investigated using non-breaking focussed wave groups. In the second the influence of wave breaking location is investigated using a plunging breaking wave. Both data sets exhibit snatch loading as {{the extension of the}} mooring is exceeded. The magnitude of this loading is not found to be strongly dependent on wave steepness, while the following motion response of the body is. Breaking location has a much greater effect than wave steepness on the magnitude of the mooring load, while significant influence of the body motion and displacement on the mooring load is demonstrated. Evidence is provided that the use of individual focussed wave groups is inadequate to assess fully the extreme loads experienced by a taut <b>moored</b> WEC <b>due</b> to the demonstrated dependence of mooring load on the body׳s motion and displacement...|$|R
40|$|The {{inclination}} of oceanographic <b>mooring</b> lines <b>due</b> {{to current}} drag causes errors in time series observations of currents and temperatures. The prediction of this effect requires {{knowledge of the}} drag coefficients for the mooring components. Drag coefficients, known for simple geometric shapes such as spheres or cylinders, are commonly used for mooring response computations. Selected mooring components (buoyancy elements and instruments) were tested in a tow tank to determine their actual drag coefficients. Over the Reynolds Number range, typical of oceanic conditions, deviations of the drag coefficient up to 50 % are found {{when compared with the}} appropriate simple geometric shape coefficients. A set of model moorings and model current profiles is used to determine the resulting changes in component depth level and displacement. The changes in horizontal displacement of {{the upper part of the}} mooring are on the order of 10 % in extreme cases and 1 % under typical conditions. Their effects on current measurements will usually be negligible. However, the related vertical displacements are on the order 100 to 10 m. Such vertical displacements may carry instruments to depth levels where currents and particularly thermocline temperatures are sufficiently different from the intended level to cause errors in the time series observations...|$|R

In this study, we have investigated the influence of drag forces on fairlead forces using discrete catenary formulation for modeling mooring line. The discrete catenary formulation has the ability to incorporate ocean current drag forces. Three types of elements; fully suspended, touchdown and seabed element are formulated to model the suspended, touchdown and seabed portion of a slack mooring line, respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the stability performance of an AHTS in operations. After the accident with the anchor handling vessel (AHTS) Bourbon Dolphin (which capsized in 2007), it was Clear that the existing criteria for the anchor handling vessel were no longer sufficient. There is an ongoing discussion that whether the criteria should be updated or not. The IMO criterion is the main criteria for special purpose vessel such as offshore supply vessel. But Bourbon Dolphin is a combined vessel with PSV and AHT. After that, NMD has suggested new criteria for the anchor handling vessel. The most important thing is to evaluate the heeling moment during the operation. Several aspects regarding to operation should be studied. Because of the characteristics of the operations, the criteria may vary among different loading conditions. NMD report has proposed some suggestion for people to determine the characteristics of mooring load. To describe the stability performance of an AHTS in operations, a computer program Maxsurf Stability is used to calculate the static stability curves and equilibrium data in various loading conditions. The vessel stability mainly depends on the propulsion system, mooring load, external forces such as current, wind force or dynamical load. In the paper, there are some researches of mooring load parameters such as the angle beta between mooring line and center line and the angle alpha between mooring line and vertical axis. The angle alpha can be ignored while calculating the <b>mooring</b> load <b>due</b> to its small effect. After application of criteria, the maximum permissible tension will be figured out. These analyses are carried out under the vessel’s working loading condition. In addition to this research, a sensitivity analysis based on modification of IMO weather criteria o can be studied. The results can be useful while designing work of anchor handling vessels and further work of analysis of AHTS...|$|R
