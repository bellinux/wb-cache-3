Analysis revealed a clear-cut bias in reference frames (origin, orientation) and scaling (brain size). Accordingly, ICBM- 152 fitted brains were consistently larger, oriented more nose down, and translated slightly down relative to TAL fitted brains. Whole brain analysis of MNI/Talairach coordinate disparity revealed an ellipsoidal pattern with disparity ranging from zero at a point deep within the left hemisphere to greater than 1 -cm for some anterior brain areas. MNI/Talairach coordinate disparity was generally less for brains fitted using FSL. The mni 2 tal transform generally reduced MNI/Talairach coordinate disparity for inferior brain areas but increased disparity for anterior, posterior, and superior areas. Coordinate disparity patterns differed for brain templates (MNI- 305, ICBM- 152) using the same fitting method (FSL/FLIRT) and for different fitting methods (SPM 2, FSL/FLIRT) using the same template (ICBM- 152). An MNI-to-Talairach (MTT) transform to correct for bias between MNI and Talairach coordinates was formulated using a best-fit analysis in one hundred high-resolution 3 -D MR brain images. MTT transforms optimized for SPM 2 and FSL were shown to reduced group mean MNI/Talairach coordinate disparity from a 5 - 13 mm to 1 - 2 mm for both deep and superficial brain sites. MTT transforms provide a validated means to convert <b>MNI</b> <b>coordinates</b> to Talairach compatible coordinates for studies using either SPM 2 or FSL/FLIRT with the ICBM- 152 template...|$|E
40|$|IMPORTANCE: There is accumulating {{evidence}} relating maternal smoking during pregnancy to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) without elucidating specific mechanisms. Research investigating the neurobiological underpinnings of this disorder has implicated deficits during response inhibition. Attempts {{to uncover the}} effect of prenatal exposure to nicotine on inhibitory control may thus be of high clinical importance. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the influence of maternal smoking during pregnancy (hereafter referred to as prenatal smoking) on the neural circuitry of response inhibition and its association with related behavioral phenotypes such as ADHD and novelty seeking in the mother's offspring. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed for the offspring at 25 years of age during a modified Eriksen flanker/NoGo task, and voxel-based morphometry was performed to study brain volume differences of the offspring. Prenatal smoking (1 - 5 cigarettes per day [14 mothers] or > 5 cigarettes per day [24 mothers]) and lifetime ADHD symptoms were determined using standardized parent interviews at the offspring's age of 3 months and {{over a period of}} 13 years (from 2 to 15 years of age), respectively. Novelty seeking was assessed at 19 years of age. Analyses were adjusted for sex, parental postnatal smoking, psychosocial and obstetric adversity, maternal prenatal stress, and lifetime substance abuse. A total of 178 young adults (73 males) without current psychopathology from a community sample followed since birth (Mannheim, Germany) participated in the study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Functional magnetic resonance imaging response, morphometric data, lifetime ADHD symptoms, and novelty seeking. RESULTS: Participants prenatally exposed to nicotine exhibited a weaker response in the anterior cingulate cortex (t 168 [*]=[*] 4. 46; peak Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates x[*]=[*]- 2, y[*]=[*] 20, z[*]=[*] 30; familywise error [FWE]-corrected P[*]=[*]. 003), the right inferior frontal gyrus (t 168 [*]=[*] 3. 65; peak <b>MNI</b> <b>coordinates</b> x[*]=[*] 44, y[*]=[*] 38, z[*]=[*] 12; FWE-corrected P[*]=[*]. 04), the left inferior frontal gyrus (t 168 [*]=[*] 4. 09; peak <b>MNI</b> <b>coordinates</b> x[*]=[*]- 38, y[*]=[*] 36, z[*]=[*] 8; FWE-corrected P[*]=[*]. 009), and the supramarginal gyrus (t 168 [*]=[*] 5. 03; peak <b>MNI</b> <b>coordinates</b> x[*]=[*] 64, y[*]=[*]- 28, z[*]=[*] 22; FWE-corrected P[*]=[*]. 02) during the processing of the NoGo compared to neutral stimuli, while presenting a decreased volume in the right inferior frontal gyrus. These findings were obtained irrespective of the adjustment of confounders, ADHD symptoms, and novelty seeking. There was an inverse relationship between inferior frontal gyrus activity and ADHD symptoms and between anterior cingulate cortex activity and novelty seeking. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings point to a functional involvement of prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke in neural alterations similar to ADHD, which underlines the importance of smoking prevention treatments...|$|E
40|$|Scalp {{coordinates}} {{for placing}} the TMS probe were determined in each participant with the Brainsight frameless stereotaxy system (Rogue Research, Montreal, Canada) {{by the use}} of individual T 1 -weighted anatomical MR images.

40|$|Objective. Despite modern {{antiretroviral}} therapy, HIV-associated neuropathy {{is one of}} {{the most}} prevalent, disabling and treatment-resistant complications of HIV disease. The presence and intensity of distal neuropathic pain is not fully explained by the degree of peripheral nerve damage. A better understanding of brain structure in HIV distal neuropathic pain may help explain why some patients with HIV neuropathy report pain while the majority does not. Previously, we reported that more intense distal neuropathic pain was associated with smaller total cerebral cortical gray matter volumes. The objective of this study was to determine which parts of the cortex are smaller. Methods. HIV positive individuals with and without distal neuropathic pain enrolled in the multisite (N[*]=[*] 233) CNS HIV Antiretroviral Treatment Effects (CHARTER) study underwent structural brain magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate regional brain volumes in these structural brain images. Results. Left ventral posterior cingulate cortex was smaller for HIV positive individuals with versus without distal neuropathic pain (peak P = 0. 017; peak t = 5. 15; <b>MNI</b> <b>coordinates</b> x[*]=[*]− 6, y[*]=[*]− 54, z[*]=[*] 20). Regional brain volumes within cortical gray matter structures typically associated with pain processing were also smaller for HIV positive individuals having higher intensity ratings of distal neuropathic pain. Conclusions. The posterior cingulate is thought to be involved in inhibiting the perception of painful stimuli. Mechanistically a smaller posterior cingulate cortex structure may be related to reduced anti-nociception contributing to increased distal neuropathic pain. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} issue in cognitive neuroscience is {{the existence of}} two major, sub-lexical and lexical, reading processes and their possible segregation in the left posterior perisylvian cortex. Using cortical electrostimulation mapping, we identified the cortical areas involved on reading either orthographically irregular words (lexical, "direct" process) or pronounceable pseudowords (sublexical, "indirect" process) in 14 right-handed neurosurgical patients while video-recording behavioral effects. Intraoperative neuronavigation system and Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotactic coordinates were used to identify the localization of stimulation sites. Fifty-one reading interference areas were found that affected either words (14 areas), or pseudo-words (11 areas), or both (26 areas). Forty-one (80 %) corresponded to the impairment of the phonological level of reading processes. Reading processes involved discrete, highly localized perisylvian cortical areas with individual variability. <b>MNI</b> <b>coordinates</b> throughout the group exhibited a clear segregation according to the tested reading route; specific pseudo-word reading interferences were concentrated in a restricted inferior and anterior subpart of the left supramarginal gyrus (barycentre x = - 68. 1; y = - 25. 9; z =  30. 2; Brodmann's area 40) while specific word reading areas were located almost exclusively alongside the left superior temporal gyrus. Although half of the reading interferences found were nonspecific, the finding of specific lexical or sublexical interferences is new evidence that lexical and sublexical processes of reading could be partially supported by distinct cortical sub-regions despite their anatomical proximity. These data {{are in line with}} many brain activation studies that showed that left superior temporal and inferior parietal regions had a crucial role respectively in word and pseudoword reading and were core regions for dyslexia...|$|E

Aims: To identify transdiagnostic biomarkers of reduced WM by meta-analysis of findings across multiple EDs. MethodWeb of Science was searched systematically for studies of whole brain analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) in adults with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder compared with a healthy control (HC) group. Peak <b>MNI</b> <b>coordinates</b> were extracted from 37 studies of voxel-based analysis (892 HC and 962 with ED) and meta-analyzed using seed-based d Mapping (SDM) Version 4. 31. Separate meta-analyses were also conducted for each disorder. ResultsIn the transdiagnostic meta-analysis, reduced FA was identified in ED studies compared to HCs in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, forceps minor, uncinate fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, superior corona radiata, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi, and cerebellum. Disorder-specific meta-analyses revealed the OCD group had the most similarities in reduced FA to other EDs, with every cluster of reduced FA overlapping {{with at least one}} other diagnosis. The PTSD group was the most distinct, with no clusters of reduced FA overlapping with any other diagnosis. The BD group were the only disorder to show increased FA in any region, and showed a more bilateral pattern of WM changes, compared to the other groups which tended to demonstrate a left lateralized pattern of FA reductions. ConclusionsDistinct diagnostic categories of ED show commonalities in WM tracts with reduced FA when compared to HC, which links brain networks involved in cognitive and affective processing.

40|$|Pain {{perception}} is a multidimensional phenomenon, derived from sensory, affective, cognitive-evaluative and homeostatic information. Neuroimaging studies of pain perception {{have investigated the}} role of primary somatosensory cortex (SI); however, they have typically failed to demonstrate the expected somatotopy. An alternative network for the sensory component of pain has been proposed, involving a temperature and pain-specific nucleus of the thalamus (VMpo) and its projections to dorsal posterior insula (dpIns). According to this hypothesis, projections to the insula should be arranged somatotopically. In order to test {{for the presence of}} somatotopy in the operculo-insular brain region, we delivered moderately painful thermal stimuli to the right face, hand and foot in 14 healthy subjects and recorded brain responses using high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T. For each subject, the thermode temperature was adjusted to produce pain ratings of 5 to 6 out of 10, which corresponded to average temperatures for the face, hand and foot of 49. 6, 48. 5 and 48. 5 degrees C, respectively. Examination of mixed effects group activation maps suggested a pain-related somatotopy in the contralateral posterior insula and putamen. Construction of frequency maps revealed that face activation within the posterior insula was anterior to both hand and foot, whilst foot activation was located medially in the circular sulcus. Single subject analysis demonstrated that only coordinates for dpIns activation were significantly dependent on stimulus location (Hotelling's Trace, P = 0. 012). Coordinates for face (paired t test, P = 0. 004) and hand (P < 0. 001) activity were more lateral than those for foot, whilst face activation was anterior to the foot (P = 0. 037). Based on single subject analyses, the average standard space (<b>MNI)</b> <b>coordinates</b> for face, hand and foot activity were (- 40,- 16, 11), (- 40,- 19, 14) and (- 35,- 21, 11) respectively...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Women {{treated for}} breast cancer often {{experience}} cognitive complaints. We studied whether longitudinal changes in resting state functional connectivity from pre-treatment to shortly after chemotherapy could possibly underlie these cognitive complaints. Methods: Fifteen women with early-stage breast cancer scheduled to receive adjuvant chemotherapy underwent resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) {{before the start of}} therapy (t 1) and 4 to 6 months after treatment (t 2). Fourteen women with early-stage breast cancer who did not receive chemotherapy and 17 matched healthy controls underwent rs-fMRI at matched intervals. Images were preprocessed and warped to MNI space using SPM. Regions within the default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal network (FPN), both linked with cognitive impairment, were defined as spherical regions of interest (ROIs) around literature-based <b>MNI</b> <b>coordinates</b> 1. The functional connectivity was assessed calculating the partial correlations between the different regions within each network. We used one-way ANOVA and paired t-test to examine differences between groups at baseline and changes overtime within groups. A correlation analysis was performed to link the functional connectivity results to the subjective cognitive complaints (CFQ). All analyses were Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons. Results: Paired t-test revealed significantly increased (p<. 05) connectivity from t 1 to t 2 in the chemotherapy-treated group between the right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and anterior medio prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of the DMN. This increase, however, did not correlate with the subjective complaints. In the FPN no significant results were found after Bonferroni-correction. At baseline, no differences were found between chemotherapy-treated patients and controls. This result was not influenced by the inclusion of depression scores. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence for longitudinal changes in DMN connectivity following chemotherapy-treatment. This might reflect underlying neurotoxic changes in the brain.

40|$|AbstractIn source {{localization}} of electroencephalograpic (EEG) signals, {{as well as}} in targeted transcranial {{electric current}} stimulation (tES), a volume conductor model is required to describe the flow of electric currents in the head. Boundary element models (BEM) can be readily computed to represent major tissue compartments, but cannot encode detailed anatomical information within compartments. Finite element models (FEM) can capture more tissue types and intricate anatomical structures, but with the higher precision also comes the need for semi-automated segmentation, and a higher computational cost. In either case, adjusting to the individual human anatomy requires costly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and thus head modeling is often based on the anatomy of an ‘arbitrary’ individual (e. g. Colin 27). Additionally, existing reference models for the human head often do not include the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF), and their field of view excludes portions of the head and neck—two factors that demonstrably affect current-flow patterns. Here we present a highly detailed FEM, which we call ICBM-NY, or "New York Head". It is based on the ICBM 152 anatomical template (a non-linear average of the MRI of 152 adult human brains) defined in <b>MNI</b> <b>coordinates,</b> for which we extended the field of view to the neck and performed a detailed segmentation of six tissue types (scalp, skull, CSF, gray matter, white matter, air cavities) at 0. 5 mm 3 resolution. The model was solved for 231 electrode locations. To evaluate its performance, additional FEMs and BEMs were constructed for four individual subjects. Each of the four individual FEMs (regarded as the ‘ground truth’) is compared to its BEM counterpart, the ICBM-NY, a BEM of the ICBM anatomy, an ‘individualized’ BEM of the ICBM anatomy warped to the individual head surface, and FEMs of the other individuals. Performance is measured in terms of EEG source localization and tES targeting errors. Results show that the ICBM-NY outperforms FEMs of mismatched individual anatomies as well as the BEM of the ICBM anatomy according to both criteria. We therefore propose the New York Head as a new standard head model to be used in future EEG and tES studies whenever an individual MRI is not available. We release all model data online at neuralengr. com/nyhead/ to facilitate broad adoption...|$|E
40|$|Importance: White matter (WM) {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} identified in schizophrenia at the earliest stages of the disorder. Individuals in the general population with psychotic experiences (PEs) may show similar changes, suggesting dysfunction due to aberrant neurodevelopment. Studying such people is a powerful means of understanding the nature of neurodevelopmental problems without the confound of clinical management and allows other potential risk factors associated with the schizophrenia spectrum to be taken into account. Objectives: To compare WM microstructure and myelination in young adults with and without PEs identified from a population-based cohort using diffusion and relaxometry magnetic resonance imaging and to quantify potential mediating effects of WM on several known risk factors for psychosis. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case-control study, participants were drawn from the UK Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Psychotic experiences were assessed using a semistructured interview. Magnetic resonance imaging was carried out at age 20 years in 123 participants who had PEs and 124 individuals serving as controls. Participants with PEs were subdivided into those with operationally defined suspected PEs, definite PEs, and psychotic disorder. Main Outcomes and Measures: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging and relaxometry-derived myelin water fractions were used to measure WM microstructure and myelination, respectively. Differences in quantitative WM indices were assessed using tract-based spatial statistics. A binary model and a continuum-like ordinal model of PEs were tested. Results: Among the 123 participants who had PEs (mean [SE] age, 20. 01 [0. 004] years), 37 were male and 86 were female. Among the 124 controls (mean [SE] age, 20. 11 [0. 004] years), 49 were male and 76 were female. Fractional anisotropy in left frontomedial WM was significantly reduced in individuals with PEs (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates, - 18, 37, - 2; P[*]=[*]. 0046). The ordinal model identified a similar but more widespread effect, with a corresponding increase in radial diffusivity (<b>MNI</b> <b>coordinates,</b> - 15, 29, 21; P[*]=[*]. 0042). Low birth weight (ρ[*]=[*]- 0. 155; P[*]=[*]. 015) and childhood IQ (ρ[*]=[*]- 0. 188; P[*]=[*]. 003) were associated with the presence of PEs. Results of mediation analysis were consistent with the association between birth weight (21. 1 % mediation effect; P[*]=[*] 6. 20 [*]×[*] 10 - 3) and childhood IQ (7. 9 % mediation effect; P[*]=[*]. 041) and by PEs being mediated by fractional anisotropy changes in these regions. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of the study imply the presence of abnormal WM microstructure in young adults with PEs. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that neurodevelopmental factors cause alterations in the cellular composition of WM circuits critical to higher cognitive function. Such alterations may first manifest in childhood as reduced IQ and later contribute to PEs in early adulthood...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: There is a {{fundamental}} distinction in memory systems between long-term memory and working memory. This distinction is prominent in virtually every cognitive domain including written (and spoken) word production, where the long-term storage and retrieval of lexical information is distinguished from working memory processes deployed during production. These latter processes are responsible for maintaining the activation level of the representations retrieved from long-term memory, serial selection of segments, inhibition of produced segments, etc. In the orthographic domain, evidence regarding the processes and representations involved in orthographic working memory (OWM) has come primarily from investigations of acquired dysgraphia subsequent to brain injury (Buchwald & Rapp, 2009; Caramazza & Miceli, 1990; Costa, et al, 2011). However, the neural bases of OWM (also {{referred to as the}} graphemic buffer) has not been extensively examined. In this research we present findings from the first evaluation of brain lesion overlap in a set of individuals with well-documented OWM impairments. Methods: The lesions of 9 right-handed individuals with left-hemisphere strokes and well-documented OWM deficits were examined. All individuals had deficits affecting OWM and not orthographic lexical or sublexical processes. There were 6 males, 6 native English speakers, and 3 native Italian speakers. Neuroimaging modalities included 3 CT scans and 6 T 1 -weighted MRI scans. MRIcron was used to map each lesion. Normalization was carried out in SPM 8 with non-linear normalization parameters derived from the intact tissue, not the lesion volume (Brett, Leff, Rorden, & Ashburner, 2001). Normalized lesion maps were overlaid on a template brain, and regions of high density lesion overlap were defined as regions with 4 or more overlapping lesions. Results: The analysis (see Figure 1) revealed three left hemisphere regions of high density lesion overlap (geometric centers in <b>MNI</b> <b>coordinates)</b> : (1) along the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), with primary concentration in the anterior region (- 36, - 49, 39); (2) the inferior frontal junction (IFJ;- 44, - 11, 38) and (3) the insula (- 43, 5, 0). Eight of the nine individuals had lesions affecting the IPS region, while both the IFJ and the insula regions were affected by 4 of the lesions; there was one individual whose lesion only impacted the insula region. General Discussion: First, these results reveal a neurotopography of OWM lesion sites that is well-aligned with results from neuroimaging of orthographic working memory in neurally intact participants (Rapp & Dufor, 2011). Second, the dorsal neurotopography of the OWM lesion overlap is clearly distinct from what has been reported for lesions associated with either lexical or sublexical deficits (e. g., Henry, Beeson, Stark, & Rapcsak, 2007; Rapcsak & Beeson, 2004); these have, respectively, been identified with the inferior occipital/temporal and superior temporal/inferior parietal regions. These neurotopographic distinctions support the claims of the computational distinctiveness of long-term vs. working memory operations. The specific lesion loci raise a number of questions to be discussed regarding: (a) the selectivity of these regions and associated deficits to orthographic working memory vs. working memory more generally (b) the possibility that different lesion sub-regions may correspond to different components of the OWM system...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of Study : The {{pathophysiology}} of type II/III shoulder instability {{under the}} Stanmore Classification is not understood. This absence of knowledge prevents treatment strategies being devised or {{a proper understanding}} of existing therapies. This is the first study to approach this group of patients from both a cerebral and muscle analysis perspective. Methods : The assessment of shoulder movement was undertaken using two simple movements, forward flexion and abduction. The muscles around the shoulder (AD, MD, PD, UT, SA, BB, TM, LD, PM, SSP, ISP and SUB) were assessed in 21 individuals in the standing and supine position using EMG. In the supine position the movement was restricted to the movement possible in a Siemens 1. 5 Tesla MRI Scanner. Patients were recruited with Polar type II/III shoulder instability, with their inclusion confirmed by the senior surgeon and physiotherapist. In total, 16 Polar type II/III patients were recruited along with 16 age-matched controls. The patients and the controls underwent an fMRI and EMG. The fMRI protocol involved movements of forward flexion and abduction in a 1. 5 tesla MRI Scanner. The EMG movements tested were forward flexion and abductions to 90 degrees (AD, MD, PD, UT, SA, TM, LD, PM, BB, ISP). Both the patients and the controls completed questionnaires: the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI), Oxford Shoulder Instability Score (OSIS) and Beck’s Depression Inventory. Results : Analysis of the EMG data in the normal shoulder group confirmed activations in both supine and standing positions; however the activations in the supine position were of a different character. There was increased activation in the patient group compared to the control group. In the patient group, with a voxel level familywise error rate (FWER) p= 0. 04, there was a unique activation at <b>MNI</b> <b>coordinates</b> - 38 - 26 56. The cluster FWER p< 0. 001 showed additional clusters in the patient group in the Primary somatosensory cortex, BA 3, Primary Motor Cortex, BA 4, Premotor cortex, BA 6 and Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, BA 9. When the WOSI and OSIS were used as a contrast, activations were seen in primary somatosensory cortex, BA 3, supplementary motor cortex, BA 11, orbitofrontal area, BA 26, cingulate gyrus and the amygdala. The WOSI and OSIS showed a dramatically different score in the patient group compared to the controls, save for one patient whose symptoms had largely resolved following muscle patterning physiotherapy. Conclusion : The EMG studies in the standing and the supine position confirmed {{the validity of the}} fMRI paradigm. The instability questionnaires, WOSI and OSIS confirmed the patient group selection. The unique activation (MNI - 38 - 26 56) occurred within the primary motor cortex, with the cluster level voxels stretching between both the somatosensory cortex and the motor cortex. The WOSI and OSI comparisons show similar activations. This is thought to be evidence of compensatory activation. This additional activation was also seen in the EMG analysis, with evidence throughout all of the muscles that greater activation was needed to complete simple movement. Overall, the comparative addition cortical and muscles activations in patient group simultaneously demonstrate dysfunction and compensatory strategies employed to achieve simple shoulder movement...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Motor {{control is}} guided by sensory {{feedback}} to (a) optimize concurrent motor performance (b) learn to generate new motor actions or form internally guided representations of task dynamics. Here, we studied the effects of different sensory feedback modalities (visual and auditory) on bimanual coordination focusing on motor learning and differences in the dependency of motor output {{on the presence of}} augmented feedback. We applied graph-theoretical network analysis (GTNA) (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009) to fMRI data to examine and quantify the manifestation of auditory and visually mediated motor learning and the underlying changes in functional brain connectivity. This is the first study to have applied GTNA to examine motor learning, and the first to use GTNA on fMRI data in the context of motor function. Methods: Two age- and gender-matched groups (‘auditory’ and ‘visual’) of right-handed adults (N= 17 + 17, mean age 23) were trained on a ‘ 90 deg out-of-phase’ bimanual coordination pattern (one hand led the other by a quarter-cycle). This task requires intensive practice before it can be performed stably (Swinnen et al., 1997). The 2 groups received bimanual coordination training across 4 days using either visual or auditory feedback to improve performance. 3 T fMRI scanning occurred before (day 0, PRE) and after (day 5, POST) training. The fMRI analysis identified motor-related activation patterns and practice-related activation changes PRE vs. POST. For the GTNA, network nodes were defined by the fMRI activation foci, selecting regions of interest (ROIs) by placing a sphere with radius 7. 5 mm around the <b>MNI</b> <b>coordinates</b> of each ROI’s activation maximum. For each subject, the average time series (AVT) for each ROI was extracted for PRE and POST runs. Based on the AVT data, matrices of partial correlations were calculated, quantifying the unique functional relationships between each pair of ROIs. Resulting network node connections were accepted as ‘valid’ below p< 0. 001. Resulting adjacency matrices served as base for the GTNA. Changes in GTNA measures were examined via 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA with the factors GROUP (auditory vs. visual) and SESSION (PRE vs. POST). Results: Motor performance of both groups improved similarly with training, but the visual group showed a steeper learning curve and also relied more heavily on sensory feedback for optimal performance. fMRI changes PRE vs. POST manifested mainly in decreased activations in the auditory group and increased activations in the visual group. However, GTNA showed that both groups displayed similar learning effects in motor network structure, with significant effects for SESSION on all measures (all p< 0. 00001) but no significant GROUP x SESSION interactions. From PRE to POST, both groups had increases in cluster coefficients (auditory & visual: 12 % & 24 %), connectivity degree (11 % & 15 %), network density (8 % & 11 %), efficiency (both 9 %), and connection strength (2 % & 5 %), together with decreases in mean path length (7 % & 11 %). There were significant effects of GROUP for density, efficiency, and mean path length (all p< 0. 05), with the auditory group performing poorer than the visual group. The network functionality of both groups had ‘small world character’ PRE and POST. Whilst having equivalent mean learning effects in their network measures, the auditory and visual groups behaved differentially in changing the network integration of specific brain regions from PRE to POST. Conclusions: Motor learning under guidance of auditory and visual feedback shows clear manifestations of learning on the neural network level. All key GTNA measures showed consistent improvement in both groups as a result of training, indicating that mean network cohesion and functionality increased significantly. However, our findings also suggest that the cerebral motor system under auditory feedback control is subject to a greater inertia in inducing performance improvement and subsequent changes in functional connectivity. Our study indicates that graph-theoretical analysis of functional brain connectivity based on fMRI data can not only demonstrate the cerebral connectivity effects of motor learning but potentially add additional information not easily accessible with primary MRI analysis techniques. GTNA is likely to make useful and unique contributions to the examination of motor function in healthy subject groups but also in research on movement-impairing pathologies. References: Bullmore, E.
