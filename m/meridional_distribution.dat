40|$|International audienceThe paper {{addresses}} {{the study of}} the specific pattern of the subauroral ionosphere marked with the anomalous positions of the plasmapause, the equatorial boundary of the mid-latitude (main) ionospheric trough, and the light-ion trough under quiet solar and geophysical conditions near the magnetospheric shell with the McIlwain parameter L = 3. The anomaly was identified on the base of data of active experiments with the SURA heating facility on October 2, 2007, which were conducted as part of the SURA-International Space Station (SURA-ISS) program in the framework of the DEMETER satellite mission. Joint analysis of the orbital data from DEMETER and ISS, together with the results of the complex ground-based measurements, shows that the revealed effect, which is characteristic of the premidnight sector north of the Moscow-SURA satellite path, is not local. It is observed in a vast territory, extending from the west to the east along the same L-shell, from at least Sweden to Kamchatka. The conclusions suggested by the DEMETER data are supported by analysis of the <b>meridional</b> <b>distributions</b> of the F 2 -peak plasma frequencies provided by GPS radio probing of the ionosphere. Comparison of these results with the model latitudinal-longitudinal and <b>meridional</b> <b>distributions</b> of the F 2 -peak plasma density provided by the IRI 2007 and SMI (Russian standard model of the ionosphere) models shows that the model predictions are at odds with the empirical data...|$|R
30|$|Vertical {{wavenumber}} spectra {{are analyzed}} by using temperature, zonal wind and meridional wind data obtained with MU radar and radiosondes at the MU observatory in Shigaraki and with operational rawinsondes at five stations over Japan. The temperature and meridional wind spectral power densities {{of the dominant}} gravity wave increase with a decrease of latitude, whereas the zonal wind spectral power {{seems to have a}} maximum near the tropopausal jet stream axis. An analysis technique to estimate a characteristic value of intrinsic frequency from the wind and temperature vertical-wavenumber spectra is proposed. The different <b>meridional</b> <b>distributions</b> of spectral power densities for temperature, zonal wind and meridional wind possibly can be explained by a latitudinal distribution of the characteristic intrinsic frequency.|$|R

Jupiter's global- average emitted power and effective temperature are measured to be 14. 10 +/- 0. 03 W/sq m and 125. 57 +/- 0. 07 K, respectively. On a global scale, Jupiter's 5 -micron thermal emission contributes approx. 0. 7 +/- 0. 1 % to the total emitted power at the global scale, but it can reach approx. 1. 9 +/- 0. 6 % at 15 degN. The <b>meridional</b> <b>distribution</b> of emitted power shows a significant asymmetry between the two hemispheres with the emitted power in the northern hemisphere 3. 0 +/- 0. 3 % larger than that in the southern hemisphere. Such an asymmetry shown in the Cassini epoch (2000 - 01) is not present during the Voyager epoch (1979). In addition, the global-average emitted power increased approx. 3. 8 +/- 1. 0 % between the two epochs. The temporal variation of Jupiter's total emitted power is mainly due to the warming of atmospheric layers around the pressure level of 200 mbar. The temporal variation of emitted power was also discovered on Saturn (Li et al., 2010). Therefore, we suggest that the varying emitted power is a common phenomenon on the giant planets...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{formation}} of eastward jets extended from western boundary currents, using a simple two-layer quasigeostrophic (QG) model forced by a wind stress curl consistent with {{the formation of}} a subtropical gyre. The study investigated the dependency of the latitude of the eastward jet on various parameters and on the <b>meridional</b> <b>distribution</b> of the Ekman pumping velocity. The parameters considered in the present study included the viscous and inertial western boundary layer width, the parameter representing the degree of the partial-slip boundary condition, the ratio of the upper- to lower-layer depth, and the bottom friction. With the parameters used, two types of stable structures are found in the time-mean field. One type of structure represented the ‘‘prematurely separated jet case,’ ’ in which the eastward extension jet was located far south of the northern boundary of the subtropical gyre, as is the Kuroshio Extension; the other type was the ‘‘gyre boundary jet case,’ ’ in which the eastward jet occurred along the northern boundary. The initial condition decides which type of structure would occur. When the prematurely separated jet case occurred, the authors found that the latitude of the eastward jet depended very little on the parameters. In addition, this study also observed that the latitude was determined by the <b>meridional</b> <b>distribution</b> of the Ekman pumping velocity. The eastward extension jet was usually located near the latitude that was half of the maximum valu...|$|E

40|$|The {{correlation}} between dissolved cadmium (Cd) and phosphate (PO 4) {{in the modern}} ocean has been extensively studied. However, factors that cause the non-linearity in this global correlation are still largely debated and poorly constrained. In this study, we present vertical and <b>meridional</b> <b>distributions</b> of Cd concentrations along the GEOTRACES GA 02 Leg 3 transect (53 °S to 0 °S) in the western South Atlantic. The vertical profiles of dissolved Cd show typical nutrient-like distributions, matching those of the macronutrient PO 4. In the surface ocean, low Cd concentrations of 0. 34 – 45 pmol kg- 1 are measured at all stations sampled. Below the fluorescence maxima, Cd concentrations increase with depth, reaching maxima at the depths of, or slightly below, the oxygen minimum. Similarly, surface waters have very low dissolved Cd/PO 4 ratios, followed by a sudden decrease at depths corresponding to the fluorescence maxima, below which the Cd/PO 4 ratios increase with depth. These variations in Cd and Cd/PO 4 ratios are consistent with phytoplankton uptake in the surface ocean at higher Cd/PO 4 ratios compared to deep water Redfield Cd/PO 4 ratios, and remineralization of high Cd/PO 4 organic particles as they sink to depth. In addition, a comparison of Cd and PO 4 distributions in waters within the depth range of Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) in our study {{and those in the}} source regions suggests that SAMW {{plays an important role in}} the non-linearity of the Cd–PO 4 correlation in the global ocean. On the other hand, intermediate waters at the equatorial stations display significantly lower Cd compared to the southern stations in this study. We attribute this to the influence of low-Cd waters originating in the oxygen-depleted zone (ODZ) of the Angola Basin that are brought in via the Benguela and Equatorial Currents. In the deep ocean (> 1000 m), the <b>meridional</b> <b>distributions</b> of dissolved Cd concentrations and Cd/PO 4 ratios reflect mixing between North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) (low nutrients, low Cd/PO 4 ratios) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) (high nutrients, high Cd/PO 4 ratios), showing that dissolved Cd and PO 4 can reliably trace deep ocean circulation in the modern ocea...|$|R
40|$|A monthly {{statistical}} analysis {{was made of}} the effects of large scale horizontal eddy transport processes on the zonal momentum, heat and energy budgets for three layers of the 1965 stratosphere. Geostrophic wind components were computed from IQSY data at 100, 50, 30 and 10 mb for use in calculating the statistical quantities -used in the analysis. It was found that temporal and spatial variances and covariances -computed from monthly means of temperature and geostrophic wind components give meaningful results when used in the computation of momentum, heat and energy balances. Monthly <b>meridional</b> <b>distributions</b> of eddy transports and energy conversions show large latitudinal and height variations. They also indicate a physically reasonable compatibility with month to month changes in zonal mean values of temperature, zonal wind and geo-potential. It was further determined that in the winter, the eddies in the middle stratosphere convert a self contained source of zonal available potential energy into eddy available potential energy. It is speculated that further conversion of this energy eventuates in its availability as a significant source for the mean zonal motions. by Merwin Eugene Richards. Thesis (M. S.)

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{spectral}} solar zenith radiances are analyzed which {{were obtained from}} ship-based measurements over the Atlantic ocean. In combination with high-resolution lidar and microwave remote sensing optical and microphysical cloud properties were retrieved using spectral radiation data. To overcome problems of existing transmissivity-based cloud retrievals, a new retrieval algorithm is introduced which circumvents retrieval ambiguities and reduces the influence of measurement uncertainties. The method matches radiation measurements of ratios of spectral transmissivity at six wavelengths with modeled transmissivities. The new retrieval method is fast and accurate, and thus suitable for operational purposes. It is applied to homogeneous and inhomogeneous liquid water and cirrus clouds. The results from the new algorithm are compared to observations of liquid water path obtained from a microwave radiometer, yielding an overestimation for thick liquid water clouds but a slight underestimation for thin clouds. A statistical analysis of retrieved cloud properties during three Atlantic transects is introduced. Similar characteristics of cloud properties {{are found in the}} mid latitudes and northern subtropics but the large variability of <b>meridional</b> <b>distribution</b> in the remaining regions imply the prevailing influence of weather systems compared to typical cloud distributions. With about 63 % homogeneous stratocumulus clouds are found to be the prevailing cloud type over ocean, while scattered and inhomogeneous liquid water clouds amount to 16 % and 21 %, respectively. All analyzed distributions are affected by an increased frequency of small values of cloud properties caused by 3 D radiative effects. The comparison with satellite-based and ship-based cloud retrievals along the cruise track show comparable results for the cloud optical thickness with limitations for thick liquid water clouds. The <b>meridional</b> <b>distribution</b> of effective radius agreed within the uncertainties of both methods, however, the satellite-derived values are biased toward larger mean values...|$|E

From this analysis {{the mean and}} maximum combined coverages for SeaWiFS and MODIS were determined for one and four-day periods for spring, summer, and winter seasons. Loss of coverage due to Sun glint and cloud cover were identified for both the individual and combined cases.

The widespread cases of dust were classified based on the value and spread of the aerosol index data from the TOMS aerosol index (TOMS AI) satellite over the area of interest. The synoptic regimes of these dust cases were recognized using the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of their mean sea level pressure (SLP), which was obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis Project dataset. The variations of the analyzed SLP of these four regimes appeared as <b>meridional</b> <b>distributions</b> for the first two regimes and zonal distributions for the second two regimes. A surface synoptic study of the first two regimes showed that the most significant features were either a strong low-pressure system over the eastern region or a strong high-pressure system over the western region. The synoptic features for the less significant regimes (the second two regimes) were characterized by the interaction between the northern high-pressure belt, which shifted northward because of the significant regime decrease, and the southern low-pressure belt. In addition, the upper synoptic study showed that the upper synoptic systems support the surface systems. Moreover, the study showed that the surface northerly wind over the eastern Arabian Peninsula is the dominant wind during strong dust activity, whereas the surface southerly wind is dominant during weak dust activity...|$|R

This suggests that estimates of meltwater input solely based on the simulation of small icebergs introduce a systematic meridional bias; they underestimate the northward mass transport and are, thus, closer to the rather crude treatment of iceberg melting as coastal runoff in models without an interactive iceberg model.

40|$|To quote Libby and Wheeler (1997), "we {{have only}} a cursory {{knowledge}} of the distributions of dissolved and particulate organic nitrogen" in the equatorial Pacific. A decade later, {{we are still in}} need of spatial and temporal analyses of these organic nitrogen pools. To address this issue, we employ a basin scale physical-biogeochemical model to study the spatial and temporal variations of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and particulate organic nitrogen (PON). The model is able to reproduce many observed features of nitrate, ammonium, DON and PON in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, including the asymmetries of nitrate and ammonium, and the <b>meridional</b> <b>distributions</b> of DON and PON. Modeled DON (5 - 8 mmol m(- 3)) shows small zonal and meridional variations in the mixed layer whereas modeled PON (0. 4 - 1. 5 mmol m(- 3)) shows considerable spatial variability. While there is a moderate seasonality in both DON and PON in the mixed layer, there is a much weaker interannual variability in DON than in PON. The interannual variability in PON is largely associated with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, showing high values during cold ENSO phase but low values during warm ENSO phase. Overall, DON and PON have significant positive correlations with phytoplankton and zooplankton in the mixed layer, indicting the biological regulation on distribution of organic nitrogen. However, the relationships with phytoplankton and zooplankton are much weaker for DON (r= 0. 18 - 0. 71) than for PON (r= 0. 25 - 0. 97). Such a difference is ascribed to a relatively larger degree of physical control (e. g., upwelling of low-organic-N deep waters into the surface) on DON than PON...|$|R

We {{compare them to}} the previous limb measurements performed by Guerlet et al. (2009) during northern winter. The latitudinal coverage (from 79 • N to 70 • S) and the sensitivity of our observations to {{a broad range of}} pressure levels (from 20 hPa to 0. 003 hPa) allow us to probe the meridional and vertical structure of Saturn's stratosphere during northern spring. Our results show that in the northern hemisphere, the lower stratosphere (1 hPa) has experienced the strongest warming from northern winter to spring (11 ± 1. 1 0. 9 K), while the southern hemisphere exhibits weak variations of temperature at the same pressure level. We investigate the radiative contribution in the thermal seasonal evolution by comparing these results to the radiative-convective model of Guerlet et al. (2014). We show that radiative heating and cooling by atmospheric minor constituents is not always sufficient to reproduce the measured variations of temperature (depending on the pressure level). The measurements of the hydrocarbons abundances and their comparison with the predictions of the 1 D photochemical model of Moses and Greathouse (2005) give insights into large scale atmospheric dynamics. At 1 hPa, C 2 H 6, C 2 H 2, and C 3 H 8 abundances are remarkably constant from northern winter to spring. At the same pressure level, C 2 H 6 and C 3 H 8 exhibit homogeneous <b>meridional</b> <b>distributions</b> unpredicted by this photochemical model, unlike C 2 H 2. This is consistent with the existence of a meridional circulation at 1 hPa, as suggested by previous studies...|$|R

For an understanding of the middle atmosphere circulation, it is therefore very important to know the global distribution and temporal variation of gravity waves in a climatological sense.

Key results are: (1) The Cassini observations precisely measure the global-average emitted power of three bodies: 14. l 0 +/- 0. 03 Wm(exp - 2), 4. 952 +/- 0. 035 Wm(exp - 2), and 2. 834 +/- 0. 012 Wm(exp - 2) for Jupiter, Saturn, and Titan, respectively. (2) The <b>meridional</b> <b>distribution</b> of emitted power displays a significant asymmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres on Jupiter and Saturn. On Titan, the <b>meridional</b> <b>distribution</b> of emitted power is basically symmetric around the equator. (3) Comparing with the Voyager measurements, the new Cassini observations reveal a significant temporal variation of emitted power on both Jupiter and Saturn: i) The asymmetry between the two hemisphere shown in the Cassini epoch (2000 - 2010) is not present in the Voyager epoch (1979 - 1980); and ii) From the Voyager epoch to the Cassini epoch, the global-average emitted power appeared to increase by approx 3. 8 % for Jupiter and approx 6. 4 % for Saturn. (4) Together with previous measurements of the absorbed solar power on Titan, the new Cassini measurements of emitted power provide the first observational evidence of the global energy balance on Titan. The uncertainty in the previous measurements of absorbed solar energy places an upper limit on its energy imbalance of 6. 0 % on Titan. The exploration of emitted power is the first part of a series of studies examining the temporal variability of the energy budget on the giant planets and Titan. Currently, We are measuring the absorbed solar energy in order to determine new constraints on the energy budgets of Jupiter, Saturn, and Titan...|$|E
40|$|The {{dependence}} of the temperature and wind distribution of the zonal mean flow in the extratropical troposphere on the gradient of pontential vorticity along isentropes is examined. The extratropics here refer to the region outside the Hadley circulation. Of particular interest is whether the distribution of temperature and wind corresponding to a constant potential vorticity (PV) along isentropes resembles the observed, {{and the implications of}} PV homogenization along isentropes for the role of the tropics. With the assumption that PV is homogenized along isentropes, it is found that the temperature distribution in the extratropical troposphere may be determined by a linear, first-order partial differential equation. When the observed surface temperature distribution and tropical lapse rate are used as the boundary conditions, the solution of the equation is close to the observed temperature distribution except in the upper troposphere adjacent to the Hadley circulation, where the troposphere with no PV gradient is considerably colder. Consequently, the jet is also stronger. It is also found that the <b>meridional</b> <b>distribution</b> of the balanced zonal wind is very sensitive to the <b>meridional</b> <b>distribution</b> of the tropopause temperature. The result may suggest that the requirement of the global momentum balance has no practical role in determining the extratropical temperature distribution. The authors further investigated the sensitivity of the extratropical troposphere with constant PV along isentropes to changes in conditions at the tropical boundary (the edge of the Hadley circulation). It is found that the temperature and wind distributions in the extratropical troposphere are sensitive to the vertical distribution of PV at the tropical boundary. With a surface distribution of temperature that decreases linearly with latitude, the jet maximum occurs at the tropical boundary and moves with it. The overall pattern of wind distribution is not sensitive to the change of the position of the tropical boundary. Finally, the temperature and wind distributions of an extratropical troposphere with a finite PV gradient are calculated. It is found that the larger the isentropic PV gradient, the warmer the troposphere and the weaker the jet...|$|E

The 2 D-HD model grid has been deduced from the 3 D Hamburg TM 2 model with the same resolution in the vertical and meridional direction, and was designed to run on any standard personal computer. The same vertical convection scheme and wind field as in the TM 2 model, reduced to two dimensions, were used in the calculations. In addition, the horizontal diffusion parameter of the model was fine-tuned by matching the model estimated mean <b>meridional</b> 85 Krypton <b>distribution</b> with observations over the Atlantic ocean. For simulating global tropospheric SF 6 concentrations, an almost linearly increasing SF 6 source strength was applied since 1970. The latitudinal distribution of the SF 6 source was assumed to be similar to the global electrical power production. Excellent agreement between SF 6 model results and observations is achieved with the 85 Krypton-tuned 2 D-HD transport model with respect to the global <b>meridional</b> concentration <b>distribution</b> and particularly in mid to high northern latitudes. In the southern hemisphere, at the German Antarctic Neumayer station, a significant seasonal cycle of SF 6 has been observed which is reproduced by the model, however with a smaller ampitude.

At equatorial latitudes near the Huygens landing site, the surface brightness temperature is found to be 93. 7 0. 6 K, in excellent agreement with the in situ measurement. Temperature decreases toward the poles, reaching 90. 5 0. 8 K at 87 °N and 91. 7 0. 7 K at 88 °S.

40|$|An {{inviscid}} {{model for}} complete axial flow turbomachinery is adopted, which replaces the blades with throughflow surfaces. The {{main effects of}} the real blades on the flow are modelled by blade forces. The inverse method predicts the axisymmetric flow field and throughflow surface geometry for a specified distribution of azimuthal inviscid force. This quantity drives the <b>meridional</b> <b>distribution</b> of rotor shaft power. Euler equations are solved by an implicit upwind finite-volume scheme. The time-marching computation includes an evolutionary equation for each throughflow surface, which is solved by implicit finite differences. Standard optimisation algorithms are used to find distributions of azimuthal force that minimise some sample cost functions. The optimal blade shapes are given by the corresponding geometrical solutions of the inverse problem. Since the cost function evaluation is reduced to an inviscid two-dimensional computation, the entire process is significantly less time-consuming than those based on three-dimensional CFD solver...|$|E
40|$|A linear, {{multimode}} model {{forced by}} observed winds {{is used to}} investigate anomolous heat transport and storage during the 1982 - 1983 El Nino. The study compliments the work of Wyrtki (1985) and of Zebiak and Cane (1987) and contains the ocean dynamics invoked by both these studies to explain heat content anomalies. Model hindcasts are compared with observational evidence derived from the island sea level network. The <b>meridional</b> <b>distribution</b> of heat storage and the components of heat transport are considered. It is found that the mechanisms contributing to heat transport out of bands of latitude symmetric about the equator are isolated and related to the wind anomalies and wave dynamics usually associated with ENSO events. It is noted that although the spatial and temporal distribution of oceanic heat anomalies necessary to initiate an ENSO event can be determined only by studying coupled ocean-atmosphere models, {{an examination of the}} oceanic component alone is useful in determining constraints imposed by ocean dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Hydrographic (0 - 1000 dbar) {{and direct}} current {{measurements}} (0 - 600 dbar) along 165 -degrees-E (20 -degrees-S- 10 -degrees-N) between January 1984 and July 1991 {{are used to}} investigate the mean circulation and its relationships with the distributions of salinity and potential vorticity on isopycnal surfaces. Less well documented mean sections along 142 -degrees-E and 137 -degrees-E are used to complement the 165 -degrees-E analysis. The Equatorial Undercurrent is centered on the equator at 165 -degrees-E and on 0. 5 -degrees-N at 142 -degrees-E. No variation in its transport (15. 0 x 10 (6) m 3 s- 1) is found between those longitudes. We find indication of the Equatorial Undercurrent at 137 -degrees-E- 0. 75 -degrees-N in the geostrophic field. The northern and southern Subsurface Countercurrents are clearly identified by extrema of eastward velocity at 165 -degrees-E around 3 -degrees-N and 3 -degrees-S (250 dbar). No evidence of a southern Subsurface Countercurrent is found at 142 -degrees-E. At 137 -degrees-E the northern Subsurface Countercurrent is not characterized by a local extrema of eastward velocity: the North Equatorial Countercurrent seems to extend from the surface to 400 dbar with a southward shift of its core. Analysis of the seasonal variability at 165 -degrees-E indicates that the Equatorial Undercurrent transport increases by a factor 2 between January (10. 7 x 10 (6) m 3 s- 1) and July (21. 5 x 10 (6) m 3 s- 1) and the Equatorial Intermediate Current transport is halved (6. 3 x 10 (6) m 3 s- 1 in January, 3. 5 x 10 (6) m 3 s- 1 in July). hi contrast, the transport of the Subsurface Countercurrents does not vary substantially between those two months. The <b>meridional</b> <b>distributions</b> of salinity and potential vorticity show that the axes of the main eastward currents are associated with strong meridional property gradients, not with property extrema. The eastward currents thus represent a barrier to the northward extension of the high salinity Tropical Water. Relatively weak meridional gradients of salinity and potential vorticity are observed in the westward directed South Equatorial Current and Equatorial Intermediate Current...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDimethylsulfide (DMS) is biologically {{produced}} in the surface ocean and is the dominant natural source of sulfur to the atmosphere. Although DMS is an algal by-product, the ratio of DMS to chlorophyll (DMS:Chl) varies widely in the surface ocean. This is presumably because dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), the major precursor of DMS, DMSP-lyases, which catalyze the conversion of DMSP to DMS, and Chl vary as well with taxonomic composition than with the physiological state of the algal assemblage. Here we use remote sensing of Chl and phytoplankton dominance from PHYSAT with in-situ measured DMS concentrations to assess on an unprecedented spatial scale the affect of species composition on the DMS:Chl ratio in the surface ocean. <b>Meridional</b> <b>distributions</b> at 22 ° W in the Atlantic, and 95 ° W and 110 ° W in the Pacific, showed the same marked drop in DMS:Chl ratios near the equator, down to few mmol g− 1, yet the basins exhibited different species dominance signatures. Hence, our results suggest that species composition was of secondary importance in controlling DMS and DMS:Chl variations in equatorial upwellings as well as physiological shifts in algal DMS production since mixed layer growth conditions (i. e., nutrient stress, temperature and light) were relatively homogeneous over the eastern equatorial Pacific. In the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean, warm core eddies with contrasting PHYSAT signatures displayed similar DMS levels. However, DMS:Chl ratios in eddies dominated by Synechococcus (SYN) were about 50 % lower than that found in eddies showing nanoeucayotes or Phaeocystis-like signatures. DMS:Chl ratios varied with latitude in SYN dominated regions with ratios at low latitudes (away from equatorial upwellings) about twice that found at high northern and southern latitudes. This is the sole piece of coherent observations which indicates that species composition and growth conditions affect the large-scale dynamics of the DMS:Chl ratio. Overall, {{it appears that the}} DMS:Chl ratio is not consistent within specific phytoplankton groups determined from space. So DMS concentrations can not be derived from water-leaving radiance spectra obtained simultaneously from ocean color sensor measurements of Chl concentrations and dominant phytoplankton functional types. To proceed with the global investigation and better discriminate between factors affecting DMS:Chl ratios in the surface ocean, we recommend the use of PHYSAT records with higher spatial resolution in conjunction with other satellite products (e. g. particulate backscattering coefficients and indices of phytoplankton physiology and bloom status) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTrace element {{distributions}} in {{the source}} {{waters of the}} Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) show the existence of elevated total acid-soluble iron concentrations. This region has been suggested to contribute enough bioavailable iron to regulate interannual and interglacial variability in biological productivity downstream in the high-nitrate low-chlorophyll upwelling zone of the eastern equatorial Pacific. We investigated the advection and first-order biogeochemical impact of an imposed, data-based iron maximum in the western Pacific EUC using an ecosystem model forced by a global dynamical model. We imposed two source profiles of iron constrained by total acid-soluble iron measurements. Though the data for total acid-soluble iron included both dissolved and acid-soluble particulate iron species, we treated all of the total acid-soluble iron {{as if it was}} dissolved and bioavailable. A deeper (270 m) source was centered in the density horizon of the observed iron maximum and a shallower (180 m) source was located in the core of our model's EUC, where a dissolved iron maximum has been frequently postulated. These source runs were compared with a control run that contained no specific source of iron associated with the EUC. In the source runs elevated iron concentrations were simulated in the EUC across its entire zonal span, evident as a subsurface plume of dissolved iron slightly below the core of the EUC. In the control run there was no iron maximum associated with the EUC. Upwelling of iron-replete water in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific increased integrated primary productivity in the Wyrtki box (180 °W: 90 °W, 5 °S: 5 °N, 0 : 200 m) by 41 % and 66 % for the deeper and shallower iron perturbation, respectively. The source runs increased the realism of the zonal extent of HNLC conditions and the <b>meridional</b> <b>distributions</b> of biological productivity, relative to the control run. However, in the source simulations surface chlorophyll concentrations were too high by a factor of two and maximum surface nitrate concentrations were too low, relative to climatologies. The relative abundance of diatoms roughly doubled upon the input of additional iron, exceeding field observations. Though biogeochemical data are limited and we did not adjust parameters to optimize the model fits to observations, these results suggest that acid-soluble particulate iron supplied to the EUC in the western equatorial Pacific is unlikely to be entirely bioavailable...|$|R
