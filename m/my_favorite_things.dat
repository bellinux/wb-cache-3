500|$|American folk singer Bob Dylan was {{a massive}} {{influence}} on mid 1960s rock music. He led directly {{to the creation of}} folk rock and the psychedelic rock musicians that followed, and his lyrics were a touchstone for the psychedelic songwriters of the late 1960s. Virtuoso sitarist Ravi Shankar had begun in 1956 a mission to bring Indian classical music to the West, inspiring jazz, classical and folk musicians; and by the mid-1960s, a generation of young rock musicians who would make raga rock part of the psychedelic rock aesthetic and one of the many intersecting cultural motifs of the era. [...] Meanwhile in British folk, blues, drugs, jazz and eastern influences blended in the early 1960s work of Davy Graham, who adopted modal guitar tunings to transpose Indian ragas and Celtic reels. Graham was a [...] "profound influence" [...] on Scottish folk virtuoso Bert Jansch and other pioneering guitarists across a spectrum of styles and genres in the mid-1960s. Jazz saxophonist and composer John Coltrane had a similar impact, as the exotic sounds on his albums <b>My</b> <b>Favorite</b> <b>Things</b> (1960) and A Love Supreme (1964), the latter influenced by the ragas of Shankar, were source material for guitar players and others looking to improvise or [...] "jam".|$|E

[...] According to her, the video's plot is [...] "charming"; she also said that, [...] "the whole video, I'm just sitting there pining away, wishing I could be in her position." [...] In regards to the video's conclusion, White explained that Swift [...] "becomes who she really is", while Swift thought it was a happy ending. Swift commented, [...] "One of <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>things</b> about this video is that there wasn't a standard performance scene.

500|$|The album's {{influence}} has reached beyond jazz, as musicians of such genres as rock and classical {{have been influenced}} by it, while critics have written about it {{as one of the most}} influential albums of all time. Many improvisatory rock musicians of the 1960s referred to Kind of Blue for inspiration, along with other Davis albums, as well as Coltrane's modal records <b>My</b> <b>Favorite</b> <b>Things</b> (1961) and A Love Supreme (1965). Guitarist Duane Allman of the Allman Brothers Band said his soloing on songs such as [...] "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" [...] "comes from Miles and Coltrane, and particularly Kind of Blue. I've listened to that album so many times that for the past couple of years, I haven't hardly listened to anything else." [...] Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright said that the chord progressions on the album influenced the structure of the introductory chords to the song [...] "Breathe" [...] on their landmark opus The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). In his book Kind of Blue: The Making of a Miles Davis Masterpiece, writer Ashley Kahn wrote [...] "still acknowledged as the height of hip, four decades after it was recorded, Kind of Blue is the premier album of its era, jazz or otherwise. Its vapory piano introduction is universally recognized". [...] Producer Quincy Jones, one of Davis' longtime friends, wrote: [...] "That [...] will always be my music, man. I play Kind of Blue every day—it's my orange juice. It still sounds like it was made yesterday". Pianist Chick Corea, one of Miles' acolytes, was also struck by its majesty, later stating [...] "It's one thing to just play a tune, or play a program of music, but it's another thing to practically create a new language of music, which is what Kind of Blue did." ...|$|E

[...] Cote de Pablo has said, [...] "I love all of the fighting, using knives and guns and all of that. And <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>thing</b> in the world is doing stunts!

5000|$|Audien {{approached}} Lady Antebellum {{to record}} the vocals for the song due to its call-and-response structure and potential for harmonies, characteristics common to the trio's music.

[...] Lady Antebellum member Charles Kelley explained that the group [...] "knew they {{wanted to be part of}} song" [...] from the first time they heard it as they were [...] "immediately drawn to its great melody and powerful lyric." [...] The band was open to pushing the boundaries of country music with the song, noting that they had questioned how well their 2010 pop rock-leaning single, [...] "Our Kind of Love", would be received by country radio when it was first released.

[...] In 2011 Mike Love commended Parks' [...] "marvelous job" [...] with the lyrics and has described the piece as beautiful and sensitive, possessing ability to move listeners to tears.

2500|$|Coltrane's {{first record}} {{with his new}} group was also his debut playing the soprano saxophone, the hugely {{successful}} <b>My</b> <b>Favorite</b> <b>Things</b> (1961). Around {{the end of his}} tenure with Davis, Coltrane had begun playing soprano, an unconventional move considering the instrument's neglect in jazz at the time. His interest in the straight saxophone most likely arose from his admiration for Sidney Bechet and the work of his contemporary, Steve Lacy, even though Davis claimed to have given Coltrane his first soprano saxophone. The new soprano sound was coupled with further exploration. For example, on the Gershwin tune [...] "But Not for Me", Coltrane employs the kinds of restless harmonic movement used on Giant Steps (movement in major thirds rather than conventional perfect fourths) over the A sections instead of a conventional turnaround progression. Several other tracks recorded in the session utilized this harmonic device, including [...] "26-2", [...] "Satellite", [...] "Body and Soul", and [...] "The Night Has a Thousand Eyes".|$|E
