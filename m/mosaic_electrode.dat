In our previous work, we have reported the {{fabrication of}} <b>mosaic</b> <b>electrode</b> arrays composed of the central TiO 2 disks and the Au electrodes both of which isolated by a nanometer-scale gap using ideally ordered anodic porous alumina 1, 2) (Fig. 1). Using these electrodes, the shrot-lived species produced by a photocatalytic reaction on TiO 2 disks under UV irradiation could be successfully detected 3).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} combined computational and experimental study {{to understand the}} fundamental electrostatic, thermal, electromagnetic, and discharge related processes during the ageing of metallised polymer film capacitors. In the event of internal breakdowns, these capacitors are capable of 'self-healing' through a controlled isolation of defects on the <b>electrode</b> surfaces by <b>mosaic</b> patterning the <b>electrode.</b> The objective of this project is to develop viable computer models to unravel electrothermally activated ageing processes in capacitors. To provide the necessary validation to any capacitor models developed, our work is supported by comprehensive experiments including industrial standard accelerated life tests and associated breakdown damage analyses of tested capacitors. These have enabled an empirical identification of main factors affecting the reliability and lifetime of capacitors. Relevant raw data and the qualitative picture enabled by these data are crucial to the development and refinement of viable computational models of capacitors. Given the complexity of ageing processes, it is both very difficult and unnecessary to develop a one-for-all model that describes indiscriminately all relevant processes. The approach adapted in this work has been to prioritise key ageing processes and modularise each process with its own computer model. The overall picture of capacitor ageing can then be unravelled by integrating all modules together. For instance, the fine geometrical features of the <b>electrode</b> <b>mosaic</b> pattern and the capacitor's laminated structure have been assessed through a concept of field intensification using a 2 D electrostatic finite element computation. With fine geometrical features {{accounted for by the}} field intensification concept, fast electric events in capacitors can be simulated using a simple equivalent circuit model. Similar assessment of heat transfer has led to an equally efficient modelling of thermal events in capacit...|$|R

For metalized polymer film capacitors, the dynamics of electric field on the electrode surface and its resulting energy dissipation influence the onset and scale of breakdown discharges within the capacitor unit, which in turn is indicative of the reliability and lifetime. To gain an understanding of the dependence of surface electric field on key system parameters, an equivalent circuit model is developed to simulate the temporal evolution of the electric field distribution within a dc film capacitor subjected to an external impulse electric stress. A <b>mosaic</b> pattern of <b>electrode</b> segmentation is taken into account by means of an effective surface resistance and its effects on surface electric field and energy dissipation are computed numerically. Also considered are the effects of the number of electrode segments across a given length. In addition, electric energy dissipation is calculated to assess the level of possible temperature rise within the capacitor. By addressing these two issues, it is shown that the numerical code developed and its underlying methodology can serve as a complimentary tool to the present practice of capacitor designs and performance assessment...|$|R
