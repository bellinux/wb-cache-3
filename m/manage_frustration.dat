40|$|Background. Existing {{research}} {{suggests that there is}} a relationship between greater exposure to center-based child care and child behavioral problems though the mechanism for the impact is unclear. However the measure used to document child care has usually been average hours, which may be particularly unreliable in the early months when fewer children are in center care. In addition individual trajectories for behavior difficulties have not been studied. Objective. The purpose of the current study was to examine whether the extent of exposure to center-based child care before two years predicted the trajectory of children’s difficult behavior (i. e., tantrums and unmanageable behavior) from 30 to 51 months controlling for child and maternal characteristics. Method. Data were drawn from UK-based Families, Children and Child Care (FCCC) study (n= 1201). Individual growth models were fitted to test the relation between early center-based child care experiences and subsequent difficult behavior. Results. Children with more exposure to center-based care before two had less difficult behavior at 30 months, but more increase over time. Initial levels were predicted by higher difficult temperament and lower verbal ability. Higher difficult temperament and lower family socio-economic status predicted its change over time. Conclusion. Findings suggest that early exposure to center-based care before two years old is a risk factor for subsequent behavior problems especially when children have a longer period of exposure. A possible explanatory process is that child coping strategies to <b>manage</b> <b>frustration</b> are less well developed in a group context, especially when they lag behind in expressive language...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: : Computer-mediated Distance Education, DE, is in {{many aspects}} a social practice. Through web-technology {{students}} (and instructors) can engage in various joint activities that shapes a shared and emergent community. Drawing on Wenger’s (1998) work on communities-of-practice, this paper summarizes {{the findings of a}} longitudinal action research project, conducted at a Swedish distance education program. The paper argues that such communities could be understood as energies of attention that are charged and energized through actions and utterances rooted in the participants understanding of themselves as members of the community. Such communitising behaviour can aid the participants in <b>managing</b> <b>frustration,</b> and making collective sense of both technology and the shared educational situation...|$|R

Delay of gratification {{is the ability to}} forego immediate gratification in order to receive a larger reward at a later time (Mischel, Shoda, & Rodriguez, 1989). Delay of gratification is a form of self-regulation that has been shown to have important life outcomes. For example, preschool children who were able to delay gratification and resist eating one marshmallow immediately in order to receive two marshmallows several minutes later were rated 10 years later by their parents as having greater academic and social competence, a greater ability to plan, think ahead, and listen attentively, as well as being better at <b>managing</b> <b>frustration</b> and stress (Mischel, Shoda, & Peake, 1988).|$|R
40|$|Aim: Individuals with {{intellectual}} disability (ID) often {{have difficulty with}} waiting, {{an important aspect of}} everyday life. Successful waiting require cognitive, emotional and behavioural self-regulation, and is an essential element in the capacity to delay gratification. Method: We developed an intervention to provide parents with the knowledge and strategies to promote their child’s capacity to wait. The intervention was grounded in previous work about the skills underpinning successful waiting, such as goal-setting, understanding time, and <b>managing</b> <b>frustration.</b> Eleven parents of children with ID (mean CA 9. 4 years; mean MA 47 months) participated in an intervention trial. Following pre-testing of their child’s capacity to wait and delay gratification, parents attended a 1 day workshop that was followed by monthly phone discussions with the researchers to monitor progress and provide advice. Post-testing was undertaken 1 year later. Results: Compared with a wait-listed control group, children whose parents had completed the intervention displayed significant improvements in their capacity to wait on a delay of gratification task. Parents reported that their child had become more successful in everyday waiting situations. Conclusion: The results of this pilot study are promising and pave the way for larger-scale interventions to improve self-regulatory skills in people with ID...|$|R
5|$|A study {{conducted}} by a United States child psychiatrist, Dr Kyle D. Pruett, found that infants between 7 and 30 months responded more favorably to being picked up by their fathers. Pruett also found that a father's parenting style is beneficial for a child's physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral development. Mothers reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers encourage them to <b>manage</b> their <b>frustration.</b> This helps the children {{learn to deal with}} stress and frustration. A long-term study Pruett conducted proved that a father's active involvement with his children, from birth to adolescence, promotes greater emotional balance, stronger curiosity and a stronger sense of self-assurance in the child.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe present novel {{algorithms}} {{and software}} addressing four core problems in computational structural biology, namely analyzing a conformational ensemble, comparing two conformational ensembles, analyzing a sampled energy landscape, and comparing two sampled energy landscapes. Using {{recent developments in}} computational topology, graph theory, and combinatorial optimization, we make two notable contributions. First, we present a generic algorithm analyzing height fields. We then use this algorithm to perform density-based clustering of conformations, and to analyze a sampled energy landscape in terms of basins and transitions between them. In both cases, topological persistence is used to <b>manage</b> (geometric) <b>frustration.</b> Second, we introduce two algorithms to compare transition graphs. The first is the classical earth mover distance metric which depends only on local minimum energy configurations along with their statistical weights, while the second incorporates topological constraints inherent to conformational transitions. Illustrations are provided on a simplified protein model (BLN 69), whose frustrated potential energy landscape has been thoroughly studied. The software implementing our tools is also made available, and should prove valuable wherever conformational ensembles and energy landscapes are use...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To improve {{understanding}} {{of the sources of}} frustration for people with chronic pain and consider the potential influence of frustration on the chronic pain experience and relationships with health professionals. METHODS: Qualitative in-depth interviews with a diverse, maximum variation sample of 46 participants with chronic pain, 30 of whom talked about frustration. Analysis paid close attention to how people talked about their frustration as well as what they said. RESULTS: Frustration is a multi-faceted emotion and its effects are cumulative. Sources of frustration include interference with everyday activities, the interruption of life goals and roles and the unpredictability of pain; here we focus on the frustrations associated with the invisibility of chronic pain and the perceived limitations of diagnosis and pain management (both related to the perceived legitimacy of the condition). Several of the participants who had lived with chronic pain for many years described overcoming, or <b>managing,</b> their <b>frustrations.</b> DISCUSSION: If patients think that their pain is not being believed this is clearly a barrier to an effective consultation. Communication with chronic pain patients may improve if the frustration of living with an invisible, debilitating condition that is hard to diagnose and treat is explicitly (and perhaps repeatedly) acknowledged by the health professional...|$|R
40|$|When {{compared}} to most corporal discipline practices (i. e., spanking, beating, or burning), Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) {{is a particularly}} lethal form of child abuse, killing as many as 40 % of its victims. Unlike other corporal discipline practices, shaking an infant {{is thought to be}} a failure in caregiver impulse control and in <b>managing</b> fatigue, <b>frustration,</b> and anger. However, SBS is rarely deemed as accidental; the injuries that result from shaking an infant are most often classified as non-accidental head injuries. Common perception of these perpetrators is that, at a minimum, they are criminally negligent and, maximally, they are guilty of premeditation. Societal response to this crime favors punishment of the guilty, rather than education or treatment for those at risk. In the current study, approximately 260 participants completed an original survey on attitudes about infant care practices. Participants were then {{randomly assigned to one of}} three intervention levels designed to raise awareness of the practices that may pose a risk to infants. Three follow-up surveys were collected over the course of 12 weeks.

40|$|Objective: This study {{conducted}} an in-depth {{exploration of the}} factors which helped people to detoxify from drugs and the factors which led to relapse among 20 participants from Kathmandu and Pokhara in Nepal. Methods: The research took a phenomenological approach using in-depth interviews for data collection and all {{data were analyzed using}} a grounded theory framework. Results: The study found that detoxification and rehabilitation services for drug users were mostly provided by private organizations. Some of these organizations had a comprehensive plan, trained staff and counselors. Most counselors were ex-drug users, and they functioned as mentors and role models who helped some drug users to realize that successful detoxification from drugs is possible. This approach enabled current drug users to adhere to the detoxification program. These service providers recognized that 'frustration' and lack of support are leading causes of a relapse. The best programs included activities to help the drug users to confront these frustrations. Participants who demonstrated a strong ability to <b>manage</b> the <b>frustrations</b> inherent in drug withdrawal were considered to be more able to avoid relapse after discharge. Conclusions: The evidence-base is lacking concerning successful detoxification and rehabilitation in Nepal. There is also no clear policy on detoxification and rehabilitation services. The Government of Nepal needs to develop guidelines for coordination, supervision, monitoring, evaluation and accreditation of organizations which provide detoxification and rehabilitation services...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to examine the}} effects of a brief {{mindfulness}} exercise on state mindfulness, task performance, and affect during task engagement in distracting and non-distracting work environments. Previous research has demonstrated that the practice of mindfulness is beneficial in many respects, but research relating to the effects of mindfulness on task performance is limited, especially pertaining to distracting work environments. To accomplish our objectives, participants are randomly assigned to receive either a 10 -minute mindfulness exercise video or a control video (i. e., birdwatching) prior to engaging in a basic mathematics test. During the mathematic tests, participants will be further randomly assigned to either a distraction free task environment or a distraction rich task environment. Thus, we will be able to explore the overall effect of mindfulness across task environments, the overall effect of distraction vs. distraction free environments, and the interactive effect of mindfulness across distraction and distraction free environments. This research is important to further understand the effectiveness of mindfulness exercises as a technique for improving task performance, and <b>managing</b> mood and <b>frustration</b> in distracting work environments...|$|R

40|$|Many {{companies}} today face {{a highly}} turbulent and volatile environment caused by intense foreign competition, rapid technological change, shorter product life-cycles, and customers demand- ing more customized products. Several strategies {{have been developed}} to deal with unpredictability in the environment. Agility and agile methods have been widely accepted as a new competitive concept in many countries, including Finland. However, the understanding of how to build agile organizations remains weak. The thesis provides initial empirical evidence to better understand essential elements of agile workforce and their relationship with organizational agility. More specifically, the research aims to understand and describe the concept of workforce agility in the selected case companies. The second goal is to discover the management practices, methods and tools that the case companies have adopted in order to enable and support the actions of an agile workforce. The thesis employs qualitative research methods with empirical approach doing semi- structured interviews in case study companies and conceptual approach using previous academic research. The case study companies are OP, DNA and Alma Media. The phenomenon of developing an agile workforce is rather new in large previously traditional organizations in Finland. Consequently, the study is exploratory by nature and aims to increase familiarity of the phenomenon in the Finnish context. The different cases were studied through interviews with managers that have been in a superior decision-making position and responsible for the change process, and managers or employees that have participated the implementation of the change process. Also, a HR specialist from Vincit was interviewed for her expertise on enterprise agility. According to the findings employees’ agile capabilities and attitudes towards agility are important factors when transforming towards enterprise agility. Findings show that companies that aim to make their organization more agile face two kinds of challenges. Firstly, companies must be able to arouse excitement and interest towards agility among employees. The second challenge concerns enabling agile work and <b>managing</b> the <b>frustrations</b> that arise. To deal with these challenges case companies employed similar practices, tools and methods that enable change management, change attitudes and culture, increase internal communication, knowledge sharing and cooperation; support empowerment and work organization, and promote new work methods and training...|$|R

Maternal {{psychological}} maturity, {{parenting and}} toddler sleep [...] Chapter 4. Maternal and child {{factors associated with}} toddlers' self-regulation [...] Chapter 5. Maternal psychological maturity, parenting stress and toddler socio-emotional competence [...] Chapter 6. Discussion. Developing the capacity to regulate behaviour and emotions is a major developmental task of early childhood and becomes particularly salient during toddlerhood, {{in the context of}} increased cognitive, behavioural and emotional capacities. The development of self-regulation depends on children’s biological and genetic characteristics and cortical maturation as well as on learning and socialisation provided by parents. Therefore, while encouraging autonomy, parents, must balance sensitive support and teaching their toddlers with setting firm boundaries and rules. This can be a challenging and stressful period for both parents and children; sometimes resulting in temper tantrums and parent-child conflict. The current research examined maternal characteristics posited to influence optimal parenting. This research has been influenced by several key developmental theoretical perspectives that emphasise the fundamental role played by the quality of parent-child interactions in child development (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978; Biringen & Easterbrooks, 2012; Bowlby, 1969 / 1982). The research has also been influenced by the suggestion that, while acknowledging the contribution of child characteristics, the psychological resources of the parent are a key determinant of parenting quality (Belsky, 1984; Bornstein, 2006). Baumrind’s (1968) description of an authoritative parenting style (characterised by warmth, limit setting and support) provides an optimal framework for children’s emotional and self-regulatory development and further informs the specific focus of this research: the evaluation of maternal psychological maturity (hardiness) and maternal sensitivity. Child domains examined were night-time sleep, regulation within challenging contexts (daytime napping and <b>managing</b> <b>frustration)</b> and socioemotional capacities during toddlerhood. Participants in this study were 134 first-time mothers, aged between 26 and 43 years (mean age 33. 8 years), and their toddlers (mean age 19. 4 months, ranging from 18 to 22 2 months). In response to the current trend in developed countries for women to delay parenthood, women who were first-time mothers and older age were recruited during pregnancy into a larger longitudinal study. To allow for maternal age comparisons, the longitudinal study over-sampled older mothers relative to population rates; and to accurately reflect fertility decline in this age cohort, mothers who conceived with assisted conception were also over-represented. As a result, the current research sample was older than average first-time mothers in Australia, and 40 % conceived with assisted conception. This sample were predominantly married or in a de-facto relationship, English-speaking, highly educated, working part-time at 18 months post-partum, and living in metropolitan areas within Australia. In all studies, these sample characteristics were taken into account. The overarching research question in this thesis was: are more psychologically mature women more capable of providing optimal parenting to promote their children’s self-regulatory development during toddlerhood? Structural equation modelling was used to examine the contribution of maternal age and psychological maturity along with other relevant variables. Participants reported on a measure of hardiness (psychological maturity) during their third trimester of pregnancy and the remaining data were collected during the first 12 postnatal months, then during a home visit when the children were approximately 18 months old. During the home visit, two mother-child interactions (free play and frustration/split attention task) were filmed and, later, coded for a) mother and child emotional availability and b) child emotion regulation strategies and distress, respectively. All three studies considered a number of potential confounding variables including maternal age at time of birth, level of education, mode of conception, language spoken at home, hours in paid work and concurrent mood at 19 months. Several child variables were also considered: child gender, birth weight, admission to ICU, ongoing illnesses, hours spent in day-care per week, and infant and toddler temperament. The three different studies in this thesis, which were prepared for publication, addressed different aspects of child emotion regulation. Study 1. The first study focused on toddlers’ night time sleep. Participants were 134 mothers who reported on child sleep at 7 and 19 months post-partum. At 19 months post-partum, mothers also reported on their cognitions and involvement around their children’s bedtime: half the sample used actigraph monitors to validate maternal reports of child sleep. Path analysis confirmed that higher prenatal maternal hardiness was associated with fewer problematic sleep-related cognitions and less involvement at bedtime, and more optimal child sleep during toddlerhood; after considering concurrent maternal mood and child temperament, all ps <. 01. Study 2. The second study explored toddlers’ capacity to regulate within challenging contexts; namely, daytime napping and during a frustration task. Mothers (N= 134) reported on child temperament at four months postpartum and completed a four-day sleep diary at 19 months regarding both daytime naps and night-time sleep. Toddlers’ daytime napping was hypothesised to relate to their capacity to regulate emotions during a frustration task; however, this association was not found. Therefore two separate path models were tested: one to explain contributions to toddler napping, and the other to emotion regulation maturity. Structural equation modelling revealed that mothers with higher levels of hardiness and sensitivity had toddlers who napped for longer (ps <. 01), and concurrent temperamental rhythmicity was not associated with the amount of time toddlers’ napped. Unexpectedly, male toddlers (p <. 01) and toddlers with older mothers were reported to nap for less time (p <. 05). In relation to the frustration task, two explanatory pathways were identified. The first path identified that toddlers who had mothers with higher levels of hardiness and mothers who demonstrated more sensitivity demonstrated more maternal support-seeking (all ps <. 01) to <b>manage</b> their <b>frustration.</b> Whereas, the second path identified that older toddlers who were rated by their mothers at 19 months as more temperamentally persistent used more autonomous self-regulatory strategies (all ps <. 001). Both types of strategies reduced child distress; however, as expected, more autonomous self-regulation was more effective (all ps <. 001). Finally, children rated by their mothers as more temperamentally reactive demonstrated significantly more distress. That reactivity was not at all associated with self-regulatory strategies suggests that reactivity stops toddlers from being able to effectively engage in more adaptive coping. Study 3. The final study included 128 mothers for whom complete questionnaire data were available. They had reported on infant temperament at four months postpartum and parenting stress, toddler socioemotional competence and problem behaviours at 18 months postpartum. Path analyses demonstrated two distinct pathways from prenatal hardiness (one via parenting stress and the other via maternal emotional availability) that indirectly related to all indices of toddler socioemotional competence. The first path indicated that higher scores for hardiness were related to lower parenting stress scores which, in turn, were significantly associated with maternal reports of greater toddler socio-emotional competence and less problematic behaviour (all ps <. 001) as well as more optimal observed child emotional availability (p <. 05) : toddlers who are more involving of and responsive to their mothers. The second path indicated that higher scores for hardiness were associated with higher maternal sensitivity which, in turn, was significantly associated with more optimal child emotional availability (all ps <. 01). Furthermore, hardier mothers had perceived their toddlers’ temperaments as less difficult during infancy (p <. 001). This related to reports of less parenting stress (p <. 01) during toddlerhood and, indirectly via less parenting stress, to reports of less problem behaviour (p <. 01). In summary, the combined results of the three studies reported here add to a small but growing body of research that has identified maternal hardiness as an important influence in parenting and child development. These findings also reveal that maternal psychological maturity is related to maternal sensitivity and that the two together provide a positive parenting context for children’s self-regulatory and socioemotional development in the second post-natal year. It appears that a mother’s capacity to view herself, her child and her circumstances in a flexible and adaptive way allows her to engage with her child with sensitivity and provide the necessary structure and boundaries in order to effectively meet her child’s self-regulatory and socio emotional developmental needs during toddlerhood.

40|$|Introduction: Breathlessness is {{a common}} symptom of {{advanced}} disease placing a huge burden on patients, health systems and informal carers (families and friends providing daily help and support). It causes distress and isolation. Carers provide complex personal, practical and emotional support yet often feel ill-prepared to care. They lack knowledge and confidence in their caring role. The need to educate carers and families about breathlessness is established, yet we lack robustly developed carer-targeted educational interventions to meet their needs. Methods: We conducted a qualitative interview study with twenty five purposively-sampled patient-carer dyads living with breathlessness in advanced disease (half living with advanced cancer and half with advanced {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). We sought to identify carers' educational needs (including what they wanted to learn about) and explore differences by diagnostic group in order to inform an educational intervention for carers of patients with breathlessness in advanced disease. Results: There was a strong desire among carers for an educational intervention on breathlessness. Six key topics emerged as salient for them: 1) understanding breathlessness, 2) managing anxiety, panic and breathlessness, 3) managing infections, 4) keeping active, 5) living positively and 6) knowing what to expect in the future. A cross-cutting theme was relationship management: there were tensions within dyads resulting from mismatched expectations related to most topics. Carers felt that knowledge-gains would not only help them to support the patient better, but also help them to <b>manage</b> their own <b>frustrations,</b> anxieties, and quality of life. Different drivers for education need were identified by diagnostic group, possibly related to differences in caring role duration and resulting impacts. Conclusion: Meeting the educational needs of carers requires robustly developed and evaluated interventions.

40|$|Dating {{violence}} {{is a type of}} intimate partner violence. It occurs between two people in a close relationship. There are three common types of dating violence. • Physical—This occurs when a partner is pinched, hit, shoved, or kicked. • Emotional—This means threatening a partner or harming his or her sense of self-worth. Examples include name calling, teasing, threats, bullying, or keeping him/her away from friends and family. • Sexual—This is forcing a partner to engage in a sex act when he or she does not or cannot consent. Unhealthy relationships can start early and last a lifetime. Dating violence often starts with teasing and name calling. These behaviors are often thought to be a “normal ” part of a relationship. But these behaviors can lead to more serious violence like physical assault and rape. Why is dating violence a public health problem? Dating {{violence is}} a serious problem in the United States. Many teens do not report it because they are afraid to tell friends and family. • 72 % of 8 th and 9 th graders reportedly “date”. 1 • 1 in 4 adolescents reports verbal, physical, emotional, or sexual abuse from a dating partner each year. 1, 2 • About 10 % of students nationwide report being physically hurt by a boyfriend or girlfriend in the past 12 months. 3 How does dating violence affect health? Dating violence has a negative effect on health throughout life. Teens who are victims are more likely to do poorly in school. They may engage in unhealthy behaviors, like drug and alcohol use. The anger and stress that victims feel may lead to eating disorders and depression. Some teens even think about or attempt suicide. Victims may also carry the patterns of violence into future relationships. 4 Physically abused teens are three times more likely than their non-abused peers to experience violence during college. Who is at risk for dating violence? Studies show that people who harm their dating partners are more depressed, have lower self-esteem, and are more aggressive than peers. Other warning signs for dating violence include: • Use of threats or violence to solve problems • Alcohol or drug use • Inability to <b>manage</b> anger or <b>frustration</b> • Poor social skills • Association with violent friend...|$|R
40|$|Scientists {{experience}} angst {{when faced}} with the task of writing the annual reports often required by their employers or funders. Although similar annual reports are widely studied in business contexts, communication and science studies disciplines have not considered annual reporting in science contexts. This is an oversight because annual reporting {{is one of the main}} ways that scientists communicate the progress of their research to stakeholders, including publics and policy-makers. Therefore, annual reporting is one way that science is guided and constrained by societal and cultural expectations. Further, existing scholarship has not considered the scientists’ frustration in reporting, which is a missed opportunity for communication scholars to engage with real, reoccurring communication concerns. Therefore, this dissertation fills these gaps by developing a deeper understanding of the experiences, issues, and challenges of science annual reporting. Specifically, this dissertation explores the ways in which scientists’ interpretations of their obligations suggest many possible rhetorical routes to fulfill report requirements, some of which are in tension with each other. It also shows strategies report writers use to make and justify their choices. The National Science Foundation’s Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research for Iowa (Iowa NSF EPSCoR), a large interdisciplinary and interinstitutional grant project provides a useful case to study how annual reporting works since changing report requirements over its 5 -year term led Iowa scientists and staff to regularly re-evaluate how they wrote reports. Interviews with faculty and staff, annual report documents, and other supporting documents were analyzed using grounded practical theory and rhetorical analysis. The analysis identifies the reasoned, reflective, but sometimes tension-reinforcing decisions report writers make about how to manage communication dilemmas. Although communication research generally considers transfer of known genre characteristics a way to constructively manage uncertainty in how to write, this case shows the transfer sometimes reinforces problems. Annual report writers at Iowa NSF EPSCoR experience problems largely due to the rhetorical scarcity NSF prescriptions create. Changing national requirements restrict some rhetorical choices such as word count, timing of submission, and style, while also identifying varied audiences to target and providing frameworks for organizing rich detail. These prescriptions not only conflict with each other; they also often run afoul of what report writers believe an annual report ought to be like. This leaves report writers with a dilemma in how to best write a report. In particular, requirements that ensure grant research is described in detail compete with requirements to ensure concision, such as page restrictions. As well, report writers’ perception of the annual report as a stakeholder-oriented communication with unknown public stakeholders plays a role in creating rhetorical scarcity because the rhetorical tools to target different audiences also sometimes conflict with each other, and writers are uncertain which set to use. In addition, rhetorical scarcity is felt when report requirements do not seem to allow for writers to fulfill their administrative role to support local faculty and staff fairly, for example by describing all the research in equal detail. When report writers choose any of a myriad of rhetorical techniques, such as highlighting only one research project, including figures or tables, or including prose descriptions, they show the salience of two ideal visions for the annual reports: the annual report as a comprehensive inventory of activities and the annual report as a narrative of struggle and achievement. These ideal visions are important because they are whole models of good conduct and values. Report writers use these ideals to justify their rhetorical choices during reporting. Inventory includes characteristics such as reporting data in tables and appendices, targeting evaluative audiences, and valuing numeric, comprehensive, and granular data. Report writers often describe inventorial reporting in the positive frame of “keeping track” of activities or more ambivalently as merely “collecting. ” Narrative includes characteristics such as a single prose voice and temporal organization, targeting skeptical public audiences, and valuing coherence and balance. The inventory and narrative ideals imperfectly combine. This imperfect combination brings rhetorical scarcity to the forefront and reinforces frustration. Based on these results, there is a potential opportunity for communication scholars to positively engage with frustrated science annual report writers by guiding reflection about the ideals being invoked, their interaction, and their fit with stakeholder expectations. This engagement promises to help report writers better <b>manage</b> the <b>frustrations</b> of annual reporting...|$|R
