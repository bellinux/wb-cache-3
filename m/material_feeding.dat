Many systems are known and just commercially used for grain flow measurement during the grain harvest by combine harvesters. The errors and their sources during the work of these systems described by many authors are discussed. The yield measurement methods are under developing for other harvesting machines, e. g. forage harvesters, mowing machines, potato, sugar beet, cotton and tomato harvesters etc. The function principles of systems based on weighing trailers or round balers are described as well. Two methods of the mowing machine <b>material</b> <b>feed</b> rate measurement were developed and tested. The measurements carried out proved that a very good linear relationship existed between the conditioner's power input, output frequency of the apparatus measuring impact force {{by means of the}} impact plate, and <b>material</b> <b>feed</b> rate through the mowing machine.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the two <b>materials</b> <b>feeding</b> {{principles}} of “kitting” and “continuous supply” within in-plant materials supply in mass customised assembly. With the principle of kitting, parts are delivered and presented to the assembly operations in pre-sorted kits, with each kit containing parts for one assembly object. With the principle of continuous supply, a number of parts of each part number are presented at the assembly station where they are to assembled, which means that when continuous supply is used in a mixed-model assembly context, where different assembly objects require different parts, the assembler at each assembly station needs to pick the right parts to assemble on each assembly object. Depending on whether kitting or continuous supply is used, the performance of both in-plant materials supply and assembly can be affected. However, within industry, there is considerable confusion regarding which <b>materials</b> <b>feeding</b> principle should be used when. Moreover, the existing research literature on the topic is far from exhaustive. This thesis aims to provide knowledge of how the configuration and {{the context of the}} in-plant materials supply system should be considered when a choice between kitting and continuous supply is made. The research has been conducted mainly in the form of case studies at assembly plants within the Swedish automotive industry. Complementing the case studies, one experiment has been conducted. In several of the studies, it has been possible to study both kitting and continuous supply in the same setting, which has resulted in an excellent basis for comparison between the two <b>materials</b> <b>feeding</b> principles. The other studies have instead focused on aspects within each of the two <b>materials</b> <b>feeding</b> principles, enabling an understanding of how each of the two <b>materials</b> <b>feeding</b> principles can be applied and of how this can affect performance. The thesis provides a structured and thorough account of kitting and continuous supply and the effects of using these principles, depending on the configuration and the context of the in-plant materials supply system. This has previously been lacking. The structured and thorough account presented in the thesis contributes {{to an understanding of the}} benefits and drawbacks of kitting and continuous supply and the applicability of each of the <b>materials</b> <b>feeding</b> principles.

The physical, mechanical, thermal, and rheological properties of the pure PHBV were studied systematically first to lay a solid foundation for formulation development. The influence of blending with other biopolymers, inclusion of filler, and chain extender additives in terms of mechanical properties, rheology, thermal decomposition and crystallization kinetics were then followed. Creating lightweight structures by foaming {{is considered to be}} one of the effective ways to reduce material consumption, hence the reduction of density and morphology of PHBV-based foams using extrusion foaming technique were studied comprehensively in terms of extrusion conditions (temperature profiles, screw speed and <b>material</b> <b>feeding</b> rate) and the blowing agent content. The material cost reduction was achieved by adding low-cost filler (e. g. CaCO 3) and reduction of density by foaming. The thermal instability was enhanced by incorporation of chain extender (e. g.

Adding nucleation agent enhanced the crystallization rate to reduce stickiness of extruded sheet.

In each of the cases, continuous supply has been replaced by kitting, enabling comparison of kitting and continuous supply in the same production environment. The performance areas studied include man-hour consumption, product quality, flexibility, inventory levels, and space requirements.

40|$|Tube {{hydroforming}} is a forming method {{which has}} several advantages. By using pressure {{in combination with}} <b>material</b> <b>feeding</b> {{it is possible to}} manufacture products with high structural integration and tight dimensional tolerances. The forming method is especially suited for aluminium alloys which have a relatively low ductility. Finite Element simulations are used extensively in the sheet metal stamping industry, where the methodology has contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the process and the new prediction capability has significantly reduced costly die tryouts. Similarly, the tube hydroforming industry can benefit from Finite Element simulations, and this simulation methodology is the topic of this dissertation. Deep drawing and tube hydroforming have a basic difference, namely that the latter process essentially is a force controlled process. This fact, in combination with the anisotropic behaviour of aluminium tubes, enforces a need for accurate constitutive descriptions. Furthermore, the material testing needs to account for the specifics of tube hydroforming. The importance of proper material modelling is in this work shown for hydrobulging and hydroforming in a die with extensive feeding. The process parameters in hydroforming are the inner pressure and the <b>material</b> <b>feeding,</b> where a correct combination of these parameters is crucial for the success of the process. It is here shown, that Finite Element simulations together with an optimisation routine are powerful tools for estimating the process parameters in an automated procedure. Finally, the reliability and quality of the simulation results depend on how failure is evaluated, which in the case of hydroforming mainly oncerns wrinkling and strain localisation. Since tube hydroforming often is preceded by bending operations this fact also demands the criteria to be strain path independent. In this work, it is shown that the prediction of strain localisation depends on the ability to predict diffuse necking, which in turn is strongly related to the chosen constitutive model...|$|E

Predicted CH 4 emissions and human-edible proportion decreased, while NUE increased with the increasing level of milk yield.
