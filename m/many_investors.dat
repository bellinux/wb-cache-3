5|$|Icos {{was founded}} in 1989 by George Rathmann, Robert Nowinski, and Christopher Henney, each of whom had {{previously}} started another biotechnology company: Rathmann had created Amgen; Nowinski had launched Genetic Systems, later sold to Bristol-Myers Squibb; and Henney co-founded Immunex, later sold to Amgen. Icos was formed {{with the goal of}} developing new drugs to treat the underlying causes of inflammatory diseases and halt the disease process in the early stages. The name Icos comes from icosahedron, a 20-sided polyhedron, which is the shape of many viruses, and was chosen because the founders originally thought retroviruses might be involved in inflammation. The founders raised $33million in July1990 from <b>many</b> <b>investors,</b> including Bill Gates– who at the time was the largest shareholder, with 10% of the equity. The company initially had temporary offices in downtown Seattle, but moved to Bothell in September1990. Icos went public on June6, 1991, raising $36million. George Rathmann, seen as a guiding father to Icos, left the company in February2000, and was replaced as CEO and chairman by Paul Clark, a former executive at Abbott Laboratories. A former Icos manager named short-sighted leadership by Clark as a factor in the failure of the company to develop any other successful drugs apart from Cialis.|$|E

25|$|Outside of academia, the {{controversy}} surrounding market timing is primarily focused on day trading conducted by individual investors and the mutual fund trading scandals perpetrated by institutional investors in 2003. Media coverage of these issues has been so prevalent that <b>many</b> <b>investors</b> now dismiss market timing as a credible investment strategy. Unexposed insider trading, accounting fraud, embezzlement and pump and dump strategies are factors that hamper an efficient, rational, fair and transparent investing, because they may create fictitious company's financial statements and data, leading to inconsistent stock prices.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{consensus}} in the UK about the cost/benefit nature of nuclear energy, as well as ideological influence (for instance, those favouring 'energy security' generally arguing pro, while those worried about the 'environmental impact' against). Because of this, and a lack of a consistent energy policy in the UK since the mid-1990s, no new reactors have been built since Sizewell B in 1995. Costs have been a major influence to this (with Sizewell B having run at a cost of 6p/kWh for its first five years of operation), while the long lead-time between proposal and operation (at ten years or more) has put off <b>many</b> <b>investors,</b> especially with long-term considerations such as energy market regulation and nuclear waste remaining unresolved.|$|E

50|$|When {{the stock}} market crashed, Kidder, Peabody's true {{financial}} condition was revealed to the world. Most of the firm's capital {{at that time was}} tied up in securities of companies it had financed and reorganized, whose value had plummeted so much with the crash that many were completely unsellable, effectively freezing most of Kidder, Peabody's assets. Although the firm survived the crash, the company's informal structure proved crippling as many of its senior partners decided to retire, taking their capital with them. Winsor only exacerbated the problem by using his own capital to pay back <b>many</b> <b>investor</b> losses himself.|$|R
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1820s, {{however, the}} {{economic}} climate of the country had deteriorated, and <b>many</b> <b>investors</b> were waiting to see how the new Liverpool and Manchester Railway would succeed. Moreover, not everyone shared the dream. For most people the canals were adequate for the carriage of goods, while few travelled very far. Most people lived their lives within a few miles of their birthplace. The later story of the railways was a classic one of a product generating a demand, {{rather than the other way}} around. Thus, what investment that was forthcoming was for ventures for which a need could be clearly perceived, with a reasonable expectation of a good, and rapid, return. Although the surveys were useful in the planning of later lines, the three were never built.|$|E
25|$|The {{late nineteenth}} century United States {{witnessed}} a boom in agriculture which lasted through the First World War, but transportation in rural areas was inadequate. Conventional steam railroads made limited stops, mostly in towns. These were supplemented by horse and buggies and steamboats, {{both of which were}} slow and the latter of which was restricted to navigable rivers. The increased capacity and profitability of the city street railroads offered the possibility of extending them into the countryside to reach new markets, even linking to other towns. The first interurban to emerge in the United States was the Newark and Granville Street Railway in Ohio, which opened in 1889. It was not a major success, but others followed. The development of the automobile was then in its infancy, and to <b>many</b> <b>investors</b> interurbans appeared to be future of local transportation.|$|E
25|$|Controversy also arose {{around the}} fact that retail investors were {{excluded}} from the initial public offering (IPO) due to Qinetiq's complexity and that institutional investors would require less complicated marketing and financing. This led to contrasts with the 'Sid' campaign for British Gas plc in 1986, where retail investors were encouraged to buy shares, with discounts and a large advertising campaign. The issue was partially resolved by allowing some brokerage firms to place orders in the IPO as part of a combined order, allowing the firm to purchase as though an institutional investor but on behalf of clients. While this did not result in a public campaign or retail investor discounts, it did allow <b>many</b> <b>investors</b> to purchase shares. The company floated on 10 February 2006, with an IPO of 200p per share, which gave a market value of £1.3bn. On 13 February 2006 (the Monday after the Friday IPO) shares closed at 219.5p, valuing the company at over £1.4bn.|$|E

25|$|Although many {{companies}} offer courses in stock picking, and numerous experts report success through technical analysis and fundamental analysis, many economists and academics state {{that because of}} the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) it is unlikely that any amount of analysis can help an investor make any gains above the stock market itself. In the distribution of investors, many academics believe that the richest are simply outliers in such a distribution (i.e. in a game of chance, they have flipped heads twenty times in a row). When money is put into the stock market, it is done with the aim of generating a return on the capital invested. <b>Many</b> <b>investors</b> try not only to make a profitable return, but also to outperform, or beat, the market. However, market efficiency - championed in the EMH formulated by Eugene Fama in 1970, suggests that at any given time, prices fully reflect all available information on a particular stock and/or market.|$|E
25|$|He {{joined the}} Istiqlal (Independence) Party—which {{promoted}} Arab nationalism and had counterparts in Syria and Iraq—along with Izzat Darwaza and Awni Abd al-Hadi {{when it was}} founded in 1932. The party held a congress in Acre in 1932 which al-Haj Ibrahim presided over. He was designated the leader of the party's branch in Haifa. In late 1932, he resigned from his position in the Haifa Islamic Society. According to the Filastin newspaper, he did so in protest of the sacking of Sheikh Kamil al-Qassab as the society's director of schools. It was also speculated al-Haj Ibrahim quit because of the society's dominance by al-Husayni who was reportedly aiming to undermine the al-Istiqlal party because of its rising popularity. However, he remained intensely involved in Haifa's YMMA whose leadership was interwined with that of the Islamic Society. Under his leadership, Haifa became an al-Istiqlal stronghold. In line with the party's policy to expand the Arabic values, al-Haj Ibrahim became one of <b>many</b> <b>investors</b> to form an Arabic film company that would open cinemas in Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, and Amman in 1934.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} economy following {{the withdrawal of}} the remaining funds from the Bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills. On January 1, 1835, Jackson paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that has been accomplished. The objective had been reached in part through Jackson's reforms aimed at eliminating the misuse of funds and through his veto of legislation had he deemed extravagant. However, reckless speculation in land and railroads caused the Panic of 1837. Contributing factors included Jackson's veto of the Second National Bank renewal charter in 1832 and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in 1833 that caused western banks to relax their lending standards. Two other Jacksonian acts in 1836 contributed to the Panic of 1837: the Specie Circular, which mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver, and the Deposit and Distribution Act, which transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks and in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks. Jackson's Specie Circular, albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy, left <b>many</b> <b>investors</b> unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver. The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain's economy that stopped investment in the United States. As a result, the U.S. economy went into a depression, banks became insolvent, the national debt (previously paid off) increased, business failures rose, cotton prices dropped, and unemployment dramatically increased. The depression that followed lasted for four years until 1841 when the economy began to rebound.|$|E
