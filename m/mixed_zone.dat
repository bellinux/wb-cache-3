40|$|The Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims {{to protect}} the aquatic {{environment}} and human health by reducing pollutants at the source. In order to achieve this, the concentration of priority substances should be lower than Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) values at the point sources. There are cases when the priority substance exceeds the EQS at the effluent discharge, however, they should be met at a distance close to the discharge point. The zones {{in the vicinity of}} discharge points where the priority substances exceed the relevant EQS values are called <b>mixing</b> <b>zones.</b> Article 4 of Directive 2008 / 105 /EC allows member states to designate <b>mixing</b> <b>zones</b> when the pollutant concentrations exceed the EQS values at effluent discharges. But <b>mixing</b> <b>zones</b> should not affect the compliance {{of the rest of the}} water body with EQS standards. Therefore, <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> design should meet some defined criteria. Moreover for ensuring that design criteria are met and for facilitating the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> application, member states are provided with a <b>Mixing</b> <b>Zone</b> Guideline. This project applies the <b>Mixing</b> <b>Zone</b> Guidelines at the Rönnskär Smelter located in the Northern Sweden with effluent discharges to the Baltic Sea. A second assessment of <b>mixing</b> <b>zones</b> is done in a mine area with discharge to Brubäcken stream. A “Tiered Approach” used in the guidelines is followed in assessment of <b>mixing</b> <b>zones.</b> The priority substances considered in the effluents are Hg, Cd, Ni and Pb. In the Rönnskär Smelter at Tier 2 determination of <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> length is done by the Discharge Test provided with <b>Mixing</b> <b>Zone</b> Guideline. CORMIX model is used for prediction of mixing in Tier 3. In the mine area the concentration of metals at the measured points showed no exceedence of EQSs, therefore there was no need for the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> design. In Rönnskär, for effluents where more than one priority substance exceeded the EQS values, the <b>mixing</b> <b>zones</b> determination is done separately for each metal. <b>Mixing</b> <b>zone</b> AA-EQS criteria were met for each substance within a predefine distance of 500 m from each of the discharge points. However, much more investigation is needed related to the use of total and dissolved metals concentrations, consideration of background concentration and other input data which are site specific. Further research is also needed for <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> assessment where the effluent discharges contain multiple priority substances. We also concluded that climate effects, seasonal changes and other factors related to the receiving water characteristics need further investigation for a proper implementation of <b>mixing</b> <b>zones</b> for protection of aquatic and human life in Sweden...|$|R

In water {{environment}} management, a <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> {{is an area}} {{within which}} the concentration of pollutants are allowed {{to be higher than}} the water quality standards and beside which the water quality should satisfy the standards. A reasonable range of a <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> is important for the water function and environment manage. At present, there is no agreed method for <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> calculation. In this paper, a new calculation method of a hydrodynamic-based marine pollution <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> was proposed; it comprehensively considered both the source intensity and the specific hydrodynamic conditions.

It represents 2. 5  km of EL-Rayah EL-Behery at {{the vicinity of the}} North Giza Power Plant, Egypt. It simulates the thermal plume produced from the plant. The results showed that the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> depends on the flow regime, the effluent discharge and the excess temperature above the ambient at the outfall.

It was found that in case of increasing the excess temperature above the ambient at the outfall and decreasing the effluent discharge, the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> area was increased.

Within the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone,</b> a zone of enhanced turbidity (maximum turbidity zone) was observed comparable to studies in other rivers. Flocculation of particles due to changes in salinity and hydrography cause this maximum turbidity zone, and resuspension additionally enhances the turbidity in the near-bottom layers.

Inorganic, redox- and salinity-sensitive, proxies (Mn, Fe) behave non-conservatively. Dissolved iron is removed at low salinities (< 2) due to precipitation of iron-oxyhydroxides and adsorption of manganese on suspended particles, enhancing the Mn/Al ratio of the suspended matter in the same zone. At higher salinities within the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone,</b> Fe/Al and Mn/Al ratios of the suspended particles are depleted due to resuspension of sediment with lower Fe/Al and Mn/Al ratios.

The instabilities that develop at the interface of the two liquids close to the central nozzle exit are classified in three categories based on their spatial characteristics as dilatational, Kelvin Helmholtz and short wave instabilities.
