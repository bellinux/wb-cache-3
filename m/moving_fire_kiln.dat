A new stoneware kiln was built and slipware production continued using electric kilns until 1964 when all production switched to stoneware.

50|$|Finch was {{interested}} in stoneware, and in 1952 he started experimenting with the more difficult clay. The experiments were eventually successful and in 1954 the bottle <b>kiln</b> was <b>fired</b> for the last time, since it was too large and unsuitable for stoneware. Slipware production continued by using electric kilns, but was phased out in 1964. In 1974 the wood <b>fired</b> <b>kiln</b> was built to replace the oil <b>fired</b> <b>kiln</b> for stoneware production and has been used ever since.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Several tunnel {{fires were}} caused by the fire source loaded in moving vehicle. The {{physical}} model was designed based on real road tunnel to simulate the distribution of longitudinal temperature. Through fire dynamic simulation software FDS, the <b>fire</b> processes when <b>moving</b> vehicle stabilized and traveled at 10 m/s and 15 m/s in tunnel were simulated under natural ventilation of 2. 7 m/s. The purpose of research includes three aspects, first, the temperature field in the early stage when <b>moving</b> <b>fire</b> travels into tunnel; second, influence of <b>moving</b> <b>fire</b> on the longitudinal temperature distribution; third, explores the change of temperature peak and its influential factors when vehicles stops and combustion stabilizes. Simulation indicates that the airflow filed movement induced by <b>moving</b> <b>fire</b> to certain degree blocks the spread of heat released in the direction opposite to fire movement and it also entrains high temperature airflow into its movement. When ventilation direction is accordant with vehicle moving direction, the stabilized value of highest temperature point of ceiling tends {{to be higher than}} that when the directions are opposite...|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the Stockholm Convention implies the generation of national emission inventories for Dioxins and Furans. So far {{little is known about}} the emissions from processes typically applied in Developing countries. Among the processes with a high activity and a high pollution potential (since wastes are often co-incinerated) is brick making. In the follow up of emission measurements at brick kilns in Mexico (MX) soil and bottom ashes were collected around these sites and compared to samples from brick making sites in South Africa (SA) and Kenya (KY). Through the comparison of the impact on the nearby environment we tried to verify, whether the Emission Factors obtained from the measurements in Mexico can be applied to other regions where no measurements are available and where no adequate infrastructure exists to conduct. The levels in soil and ash were low in SA and KY (wood and coal <b>fired</b> <b>kilns)</b> and at a comparable level to the MX sites where virgin wood or LPG was used. The soils around waste derived fuel <b>fired</b> <b>kilns</b> in MX were somewhat higher, but still at levels that can e found in rural environments of the Northern Hemisphere. Apart from the overall confirmation of the applicability of the emission factors obtained from the study in MX, the very low level in the background soils investigated confirms the global North/South gradient of POPs pollution.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to design and produce a gas and wood <b>fired</b> <b>kilns</b> with waste pots and potsherds that are as efficient as electricity and gas operated kilns which are built using conventional refractory bricks. Waste pots and potsherds were collected from two different pot producing communities, that is, Ojah in Akoko Edo and Imiegba in Etsako Central Local Government Ares of Edo State. To determine the suitability of the sample pots and potsherds collected for the construction of the kilns, the following tests were carried out: shrinkage, porosity and insulating tests. Two kilns were designed and constructed, a gas and wood <b>fired</b> <b>kilns.</b> The <b>firing</b> space and the outer wall of the gas kiln were designed to be circular with one burner port using only potsherd and mortar without using whole pots. The wood kiln was designed to have circular internal firing chamber, two fire boxes and a chimney. The kilns were subjected to series of gloss firing with wood and gas as sources of fuel and the maturing temperatures were recorded. The efficiency of the kilns constructed revealed that they were capable of firing to temperature above 1200 °C that was originally planned for it to be attained coupled with uniform heat distribution experienced without any indication of cold spot. These kilns are capable of sustaining the deficiency arising from lack of imported kilns {{that could be used to}} accomplish finished ceramic productions as it is being currently encountered in Nigerian tertiary institutions and cottage level industries. </p...|$|R
