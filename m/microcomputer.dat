5|$|The first {{hardware}} {{product was}} the Z-80 SoftCard which enabled the Apple II {{to run the}} CP/M operating system, at the time an industry-standard operating system for running business software and many compilers and interpreters for several high-level languages on microcomputers. The SoftCard was first demonstrated publicly at the West Coast Computer Faire in March 1980. It was an immediate success; 5,000 cards, a large number given the <b>microcomputer</b> market at the time, were purchased in the initial three months at $349 each and it was Microsoft's number one revenue source in 1980.|$|E
5|$|ABA Games' sole developer, Kenta Cho, {{began writing}} {{games as a}} child during the 1980s using the NEC PC-6001 <b>microcomputer,</b> as there were few commercially {{available}} games. After leaving university, Cho contemplated professional games development but ultimately instead joined Toshiba to work in multimedia research and development. He continues to work full-time for Toshiba while running ABA Games as a hobby, working mainly on weekends. Cho is the sole contributor to ABA Games. Lacking musical training, he creates the soundtracks to his games using commercially available, pre-made samples. ABA Games releases a game approximately every six months, with {{the first three months}} spent creating prototypes and the latter three spent refining a finished version.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} the use of <b>microcomputers</b> for student instruction in Indiana public high schools. An additional purpose was to identify the number and brand of <b>microcomputers</b> in Indiana public high schools. To accomplish the purposes, 363 public high school principals were requested to give questionnaires to eleven department chairpersons. Questionnaires were returned by 282, 78 percent, of the principals. Data were tabulated for raw scores and percentages.

40|$|<b>Microcomputers</b> {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of modern society. Not surprisingly, <b>microcomputers</b> are an intrinsic part of two of the most essential occupational callings in the United States [...] agriculture and education. The different uses of <b>microcomputers</b> in these two areas continue to expand as a consequence of an increase in flexibility and a decrease in price. <b>Microcomputers</b> may be found in the smallest rural schools as well as the largest urban schools. In these settings, voca-tional agriculture is one discipline taking advantage of this emerging educational technology. Bowen (1985) commented that the roles of <b>microcomputers</b> in agricultural education have increasingly become more visible. Bowen further suggested that agricultural education is moving beyond the awareness and literacy stages in adopting <b>microcomputers</b> to the vocational agriculture classroom. As agricultural education progresses beyond the infancy stage in adopting <b>microcomputers</b> to the classroom, the issue arises as to where agricultura...|$|R
5|$|In the mid-1980s, {{following}} {{the success of}} their isometric Filmation game engine behind titles like Knight Lore, the Stampers founded a separate company: Rare Designs of the Future, later shortened to Rare. While Ultimate was built for the British home <b>microcomputer</b> market, Rare was founded with an eye toward the burgeoning Japanese video game console market, having been apprised of Nintendo by their Japanese arcade industry contacts. Nintendo initially rebuffed the brothers' interest in 1983, which led Chris Stamper to study the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) hardware for six months. The brothers flew to Kyoto to present software samples to Nintendo executives. Nintendo purchased the Stampers' Slalom, which sold half a million units, and made the Stampers into Nintendo's first Western third-party developer. As interest in Filmation and the Spectrum began to wane, the brothers sold part of Ultimate to U.S. Gold and began to focus on Rare, though the Stampers retained a majority stake in Ultimate.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} would spawn Microsoft {{initiated}} when Paul Allen showed Bill Gates {{the first of}} January, 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that demonstrated the Altair 8800. Allen and Gates saw potential to develop an implementation of the programming language BASIC interpreter for the system. Bill Gates called the creators of the new <b>microcomputer,</b> Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), offering to demonstrate the implementation {{in order to win}} a contract with the company. Allen and Gates had neither an interpreter nor an Altair system, yet in the eight weeks before the demo, they developed an interpreter. When Allen flew to Albuquerque to meet with MITS, the interpreter worked and MITS agreed to distribute Altair BASIC. Allen and Gates left Boston, where Allen worked for Honeywell and Gates was enrolled in Harvard, moved to Albuquerque (where MITS was located), and co-founded Microsoft there. Revenues of the company totaled $16,005 by the end of 1976.|$|E

25|$|To {{promote the}} Computer Faires and {{circulate}} news and gossip about the then-infant <b>microcomputer</b> industry, he founded and edited the first free tabloid newspaper about microcomputing, the irregular Silicon Gulch Gazette (SGG), published from issue #0 in February, 1977, through issue #43, in January, 1986.|$|E
25|$|While which {{specific}} {{system is}} considered the first <b>microcomputer</b> {{is a matter of}} debate, as there were several unique hobbyist systems developed based on the Intel 4004 and its successor, the Intel 8008, the first commercially available <b>microcomputer</b> kit was the Intel 8080-based Altair 8800, which was announced in the January 1975 cover article of Popular Electronics. However, this was an extremely limited system in its initial stages, having only 256 bytes of DRAM in its initial package and no input-output except its toggle switches and LED register display. Despite this, it was initially surprisingly popular, with several hundred sales in the first year, and demand rapidly outstripped supply. Several early third-party vendors such as Cromemco and Processor Technology soon began supplying additional S-100 bus hardware for the Altair 8800.|$|E
