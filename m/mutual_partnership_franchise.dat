40|$|Cultural {{competency}} is {{a crucial}} component of baccalaureate nursing education to support patient-centered practice (Calvillo, Clark, Ballantyne, Pacquiao, Purnell, and Villarruel 2009). Studying abroad is associated with short-term gains in students' cultural competency; however, little research has addressed whether cultural competence is affected long-term, particularly when the study abroad experience is relatively short (Phillips, Bloom, Gainey, and Chiocca, in press). Therefore, the question that drove this study was: what are {{the long-term effects of}} a short-term study abroad experience on baccalaureate nursing students? The {{participants in this study were}} practicing nurses (N= 21) who had traveled to Ghana for two-week study abroad experiences as senior nursing students between 2011 and 2015. Qualitative data (collected immediately post-travel) with these participants revealed four key themes of transformation consistent with cultural transformation: adaptability, cultural competency, understanding of social determinants of health, and <b>mutual</b> <b>partnerships</b> with patients. Social media was used to enroll participants in a study conducted over a one-month period in Fall 2016. Of the 45 contacted, 28 responded and consented to participate and 21 completed data collection. A series of Likert-style questions (5 =Strongly Agree, 1 =Strongly Disagree) were used to measure these nurses' perceived immediate post-travel change, versus their perceptions of the sustained changes over time.

40|$|Moves {{beyond the}} {{boundaries}} of single-employer organizations to analyze the contemporary reality for many organizations today Deals with public-private <b>partnerships,</b> <b>franchises,</b> and agency employees Draws on rich and detailed case studies and interviews Explores issues of inter-organizational relationships and coordination This major new book examines the way in which employment is managed across organizational boundaries. It analyses how public-private <b>partnerships,</b> <b>franchises,</b> agencies, and other forms of inter-firm contractual relations impact on work and employment and the experiences of those working in these increasingly significant forms of organization. It draws upon research undertaken in eight separate networks comprising over 50 organizations to explore the fragmenting effects of contemporary changes in the organization of work and employment relationships. It considers the consequences of increased reliance upon inter-organizational mechanisms for producing goods and especially for delivering services. It argues that established analyses continue to rely too heavily upon a model of the single employing organization whereas today the situation is often more complex and confused. Public-private `partnerships' are one high profile example of this phenomenon but private enterprises are also developing new relations with their clients and customers that impinge upon the nature of the employment relationship. Established hierarchical forms are becoming disordered, with consequences for career patterns, training and skills, pay structures, disciplinary practice, worker voice, and the gendered division of labour. The findings of the study raise questions about the governance of such complex organizational forms, the appropriateness of current institutions for addressing this complexity, and the challenge of harnessing employee commitment in circumstances where human resource practices are shaped by organizations other than the legal employer. Using an analytical schema of three dimensions (institutional, organizational, employment) and four themes (power, risk, identity, trust), the authors adopt an inter-disciplinary perspective to address these complex and critically important practical, policy, and theoretical concerns. Fragmenting Work will be vital reading for all those wishing to understand the contemporary realities of work and employment...|$|R
30|$|Based on Table  4, some {{endogenous}} attributes {{have the}} same effect on all communities. In particular, reciprocity has a significant positive effect on 80 % of our sample (in 15 %, reciprocity has no effect on the emergence of new relations between suppliers and customers). Thus, in 80 % of the communities, there is a high chance of the emergence of a link from a supplier to a customer if the reverse relation exists. A few communities (5 %) show a negative effect of reciprocity on the appearance of new links between firms. These five communities are characterized by an absence of reciprocal links; three of them have 2 reciprocal links, one has 0 reciprocal links, and one has 4 reciprocal links. Thus, the observed negative effect can be interpreted as an absence of <b>mutual</b> <b>partnerships.</b>|$|R

Although the process of integration had been initially very successful, present relations are going through a crisis of opinion leading to a slowdown in the smooth dynamic of communication. There are many problems within current relations whose origins spring not only from the disunity of opinion between the EU and Russia, but also from the differing rhetoric of European member states.

Five levels of understanding were articulated that formed a developmental trajectory in which young children saw teaching as action-based and concrete, focused on helping them do things right. By middle childhood, recognition of basic principles of teaching and learning were evident, then consciousness of the interdependence of teaching and learning. In early adolescence, emergent philosophical views on the nature of knowledge were expressed.
