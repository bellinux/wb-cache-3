5|$|Meat ants {{engage in}} ritualised fights to {{maintain}} and resolve boundary disputes with neighbouring colonies. When individuals from separate colonies meet, they will engage each other until appeasement occurs. A meat ant detects a foreign worker by intense antennation and gaping of the mandibles, and will also stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger, suggesting that meat ants {{do this in a}} display of size matching. Once the ants have finished fighting, they will groom themselves and search for another ant. Such disputes between colonies may continue for <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> years in the same area, and escalated fights that result in serious injury or death are rare.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the caps}} and the stems contain the psychoactive compounds, {{although}} the caps consistently contain more. The spores of these mushrooms {{do not contain}} psilocybin or psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early {{in the formation of}} fruit bodies or sclerotia, younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 1.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms. The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their potency for <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> years, while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin.|$|E

5|$|Champollion married Rosine Blanc (17941871) in 1818 {{after four}} years of engagement, they had one {{daughter}}, Zoraïde Chéronnet-Champollion (182489). Rosine was the daughter of a well-to-do family of Grenoblean glovemakers. At first her father did not approve of the match, since Champollion was a mere assistant professor when they first met, but with his increasing reputation he eventually agreed. Originally Jacques-Joseph did not approve of his brother's marriage either, finding Rosine too dull-witted, and he did not attend the wedding, but later he grew fond of his sister in-law. Although a happy family man, especially adoring his daughter, Champollion was frequently away from his family for <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> years at a time, while traveling to Paris, to Italy, and to Egypt. While in Livorno, Champollion developed an infatuation with an Italian poet, Angelica Palli. She presented an ode to Champollion's work at a celebration in his honor, and the two exchanged letters for a while, but an affair never developed.|$|E

She also manifests when one of her priests leads a new convert to her faith in prayer, which is itself an offering to Eilistraee. She does this often, about 68% of the time.|$|R

However, some research supports that the average time to complete recovery is 6.25 years, and the more severe the case is, the longer recovery period.|$|E
25|$|If untreated, the {{bacteria}} may {{persist in the}} body for <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> years, despite the production of B. burgdorferi antibodies by the immune system. The spirochetes may avoid the immune response by decreasing expression of surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies, antigenic variation of the VlsE surface protein, inactivating key immune components such as complement, and hiding in the extracellular matrix, which may interfere with the function of immune factors.|$|E

25|$|Most smokers, when {{denied access}} to nicotine, exhibit {{symptoms}} such as irritability, jitteriness, dry mouth, and rapid heart beat. The onset of these symptoms is very fast, nicotine's half-life being only 2 hours.. The psychological dependence may linger for <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> many years. Unlike some recreational drugs, nicotine does not measurably alter a smoker's motor skills, judgement, or language abilities while {{under the influence of}} the drug. Tobacco withdrawal has been shown to cause clinically significant distress.|$|E
25|$|The delay between {{consumption}} of a contaminated food and {{appearance of the}} first symptoms of illness is called the incubation period. This ranges from hours to days (and rarely <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> years, {{such as in the}} case of listeriosis or bovine spongiform encephalopathy), depending on the agent, and on how much was consumed. If symptoms occur within one to six hours after eating the food, it suggests that it is caused by a bacterial toxin or a chemical rather than live bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Oil spills {{penetrate}} {{into the}} structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals, reducing its insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water. Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and biodegradation), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved. Spills may take weeks, <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> years to clean up.|$|E

25|$|When {{there is}} distant metastasis, the cancer is {{generally}} considered incurable. The five-year survival rate is less than 10%. The median survival is 6–12 months. Treatment is palliative, focusing on life extension and quality of life. In some cases, patients may live many <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> years with metastatic melanoma (depending on the aggressiveness of the treatment). Metastases to skin and lungs have a better prognosis. Metastases to brain, bone and liver {{are associated with a}} worse prognosis. Survival is better with metastasis in which the location of the primary tumor is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The {{entire process}} was {{undertaken}} {{with the utmost}} secrecy, {{as much for the}} public as for the accused, who were not informed about the accusations that were levied against them. <b>Months</b> <b>or</b> <b>even</b> years could pass without the accused being informed about why they were imprisoned. The prisoners remained isolated, and, during this time, the prisoners were not allowed to attend Mass nor receive the sacraments. The jails of the Inquisition were no worse than those of secular authorities, and there are even certain testimonies that occasionally they were much better.|$|E
5000|$|Some have {{suggested}} that the only reason Katsunori Nomura was given the opportunity to play in the NPB was because of his father's connections in the league.

Off-road walkers usually complete the journey {{in two to}} three months. There is a considerable choice of off-road routes, but all are much longer than the shortest road distance, usually 1200 mi or more.
