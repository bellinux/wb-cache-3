500|$|Kiedis wrote {{much of the}} song's lyrics {{during a}} period when he felt distraught and emotionally drained. He had {{maintained}} sobriety for roughly three years and felt that this had distanced him from his bandmates. While the group worked on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Frusciante and Flea often smoked marijuana together, ignoring Kiedis, who felt that Frusciante was [...] "no longer in [...] world." [...] Driving home after rehearsal in April 1991, Kiedis thought of his heroin and cocaine addiction during his relationship with former girlfriend Ione Skye: [...] "the loneliness that I was feeling triggered memories of <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> Ione and how I'd had this beautiful angel of {{a girl who was}} willing to give me all of her love, and instead of embracing that, I was downtown with fucking gangsters shooting speedballs under a bridge." ...|$|E

With the Huskies, she switched permanently to goalkeeper under {{the lead of}} head coach Lesle Gallimore and goalkeeper coach and former national team player, Amy Griffin. Solo described the transition in her memoir, [...] "In high school, I had been the forward who won games. It was a huge mental adjustment to learn that {{my job was to}} save games. To anticipate what was needed. Before, I would stand in goal, the ball would come toward me, and I'd use my athletic ability to make the save. But thanks to Amy's tutelage and <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> the national team, I was becoming a much better tactical goalkeeper. I learned how to read my opponents' runs toward goal, how to position my defenders, how to see the angles... The intellectual side also made goalkeeping so much more interesting. It wasn't just ninety minutes of waiting for my defense to make a mistake. It was ninety minutes of tactics and strategy. The personality traits that had been shaped by my childhood—resilience and toughness—were assets at the position." ...|$|E

She wrote privately to Paulette Cooper, {{the author of the}} book The Scandal of Scientology who was subsequently targeted by the Church's Operation Freakout. Northrup told Cooper that Hubbard was a dangerous lunatic, and that although her own life had been transformed when she left him, she was still afraid both of him and of his followers, whom she later described as looking [...] "like Mormons, but with bad complexions." [...] In July 1986 she was interviewed by the ex-Scientologist Bent Corydon several months after Hubbard's death, which had reduced her fear of retaliation.

It is now in the Stephen A. Kent Collection on Alternative Religions at the University of Alberta. Rejecting any suggestion that she was some kind of [...] "pathetic person who has suffered through the years because of <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> Ron", Northrup spoke of her relief that she had been able to put it behind her. She stated that she was [...] "not interested in revenge; I'm interested in the truth" ...|$|E

Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, [...] "If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can give it to him. I was attacking all the time.

I trained with all my heart to get this type of result. This is not fair. There's not reason for another fight."
