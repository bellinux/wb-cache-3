5|$|Although the {{black-throated blue warbler}} is a {{socially}} monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage is identified by <b>microsatellites</b> in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and {{that the majority of}} the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony but there is no significant association with population level synchrony.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the work}} on {{albatross}} genera, Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised taxonomy with 24 different species, compared to the 14 then accepted. This expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species, but was criticised for not using, in every case, peer reviewed information to justify the splits. Since then, further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and <b>microsatellites</b> agreed with {{the conclusion that the}} Antipodean albatross and the Tristan albatross were distinct from the wandering albatross, per Robertson and Nunn, but found that the suggested Gibson's albatross, Diomedea gibsoni, was not distinct from the Antipodean albatross. For the most part, an interim taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by ITIS and many other researchers, though by no means allâ€”in 2004 Penhallurick and Wink called for the number of species to be reduced to 13 (including the lumping of the Amsterdam albatross with the wandering albatross), although this paper was itself controversial. On all sides is the widespread agreement on the need for further research to clarify the issue.|$|E

In the present study, di-nucleotide/tetra-nucleotide repeat <b>microsatellite</b> loci were isolated following the FLASCO (fast isolation by AFLP of sequences containing repeats) approach and the sequences were analyzed {{for the purpose of}} learning how <b>microsatellite</b> structure impacted on isolation efficiency. We found that most di-nucleotide repeat <b>microsatellite</b> loci were involved in the <b>microsatellite</b> DNA family, which resulted in low isolation efficiency. In contrast, no <b>microsatellite</b> DNA family members were found in the tetra-nucleotide repeat <b>microsatellite</b> loci. On the basis of analysis of the three <b>microsatellite</b> DNA families found in the present study, there were significant differences in the extent of variation between the upstream and downstream flanking sequences in same <b>microsatellite</b> DNA family. This variation was the highest in the sequence sections adjacent to the core repeated units, but more conservative in other regions, which might reflect the complexity of the <b>microsatellite</b> DNA family evolution.

Silencing of a DNA mismatch repair gene, hMLH 1 gene, by promoter hypermethylation is a frequent cause of the <b>microsatellite</b> instability-H phenotype. Using methylation specific PCR we investigated the methylation status of the hMLH 1 gene promoter in 17 solitary gastric cancers (12 <b>microsatellite</b> instability-H and five <b>microsatellite</b> stable tumours from 17 patients), and 13 multiple gastric cancers (eight <b>microsatellite</b> instability-H, one low frequency <b>microsatellite</b> instability-L and four <b>microsatellite</b> stable tumours from five patients) and also examined non-cancerous gastric mucosa both adjacent to and distant from each tumour. Expression of hMLH 1 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. All <b>microsatellite</b> instability-H tumours (20 out of 20) had evidence of methylation of hMLH 1 promoter, whereas {{only one out of}} 10 <b>microsatellite</b> instability-L and <b>microsatellite</b> stable tumours did (P< 0. 0000005), and the methylation status correlated with hMLH 1 protein expression (P< 0. 000003). Furthermore, methylation of the hMLH 1 promoter was detected in 50 % (6 out of 12) and 63 % (5 out of 8) of non-cancerous gastric mucosa samples adjacent to, and in 33 % (4 out of 12) and 40 % (2 out of 5) of those obtained from distant portion of, solitary and multiple cancers with <b>microsatellite</b> instability-H. Thus both solitary and multiple gastric cancers with <b>microsatellite</b> instability-H have evidence of similar high levels of hMLH 1 promoter hypermethylation in the surrounding non-cancerous tissue.

Recent evidence suggests that <b>microsatellite</b> instability also occurs in various sub-sets of common, non-hereditary forms of extra-colorectal carcinoma. To investigate the role of <b>microsatellite</b> instability in breast cancer, and to correlate this type of alteration with clinico-pathological characteristics, including tumor proliferative activity, we analyzed the status of 8 different <b>microsatellite</b> loci in 28 cases of primary mammary carcinoma.

Genetic study of this species is challenging due to their elusive nature and limited available information. In the present study, samples were collected by using non-invasive genetic techniques and genotyping individual pine marten using <b>microsatellite</b> markers. The objectives of my study were primarily to develop <b>microsatellite</b> panel from the <b>microsatellite</b> markers previously used for other mustelid species and secondarily to evaluate DNA extraction methods from different biological samples. DNA was successfully extracted from fresh muscle tissue, hair and dry skin with fur (samples from museum specimen). However, the quality of DNA extracted from hair samples and museum specimen samples was considerably low. For {{the development of the}} <b>microsatellite</b> panels, 18 <b>microsatellite</b> markers were successfully grouped into 3 PCR multiplex panels including one sex identifying marker containing 4 - 8 <b>microsatellite</b> loci in each multiplex panel. One of the fresh muscle tissue sample successfully amplified 100 % <b>microsatellite</b> loci used in this study. Out of the other remaining 6 tissues including frozen tissue samples analyzed, 79 % of the <b>microsatellite</b> loci were amplified on genotyping while only 32 % of the <b>microsatellite</b> loci were amplified in 8 hair samples. On the other hand, museum specimen sample did not amplify <b>microsatellite</b> loci at all. The genotyping success rate of hair samples was found to be significantly lower compared to tissue samples. However, due to a smaller size of hair samples and degradation of DNA extracted from hair samples, I could not tests sufficient to draw a clear conclusion about genotyping success rate of hair samples. The genotyping result showed that all the <b>microsatellite</b> loci had variation in alleles ranging from 2 to 11 alleles per locus.

25|$|A {{genetic map}} is a map {{based on the}} {{frequencies}} of recombination between markers during crossover of homologous chromosomes.

25|$|A {{microsatellite}} is a {{tract of}} repetitive DNA in which certain DNA motifs (ranging in length from 1â€“6 or more base pairs) are repeated, typically 5â€“50 times. <b>Microsatellites</b> occur at thousands of locations within an organism's genome. They {{have a higher}} mutation rate than other areas of DNA DNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for reading DNA during replication, can slip while moving along the template strand and continue at the wrong nucleotide. DNA polymerase slippage {{is more likely to}} occur when a repetitive sequence (such as CGCGCG) is replicated. Because <b>microsatellites</b> consist of such repetitive sequences, DNA polymerase may make errors at a higher rate in these sequence regions. Several studies have found evidence that slippage is the cause of microsatellite mutations. Typically, slippage in each microsatellite occurs about once per 1,000 generations. Thus, slippage changes in repetitive DNA are three orders of magnitude more common than point mutations {{in other parts of the}} genome. Most slippage results in a change of just one repeat unit, and slippage rates vary for different allele lengths and repeat unit sizes, and within different species. If there is a large size difference between individual alleles, then there may be increased instability during recombination at meiosis.|$|E
