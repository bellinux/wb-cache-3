5|$|The Moon landing {{data was}} {{recorded}} {{by a special}} Apollo TV camera which recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast TV. This resulted in lunar footage {{that had to be}} converted for the live television broadcast and stored on magnetic telemetry tapes. During the following years, a magnetic tape shortage prompted NASA to remove massive numbers of <b>magnetic</b> <b>tapes</b> from the National Archives and Records Administration to be recorded over with newer satellite data. Stan Lebar, who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at Westinghouse Electric Corporation, also worked with Nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} had a Simulation for Automatic Machinery computer {{built by}} FFI which allowed for real-time operations with the data. Telecommunications systems were {{operated by the}} Norwegian Telecommunications Administration, which established a two-way radio station at Ny-Ålesund. Communication from the satellites was relayed by radio to Ski and onwards with a leased line to the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Return information was relayed via a radio station at Jeløy. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>tapes</b> were sent to Darmstadt every other week, first via aircraft to Longyearbyen and then onwards to Germany.

25|$|The {{founding}} {{figure of}} the field in Israel, Josef Tal, was first exposed to electronic music in the late 1920s in Germany. The founding of the Israel Center for Electronic Music {{was the result of}} a six-month UNESCO research fellowship on which Tal toured major international electronic music studios, in 1958. It was a meeting with Milton Babbitt at The Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center that pointed Josef Tal to the technology he needed to found the first electronic music studio in Israel. He learned from Vladimir Ussachevsky, about a new invention by Canadian inventor Hugh Le Caine, called the Multi-track. First built in 1955, this device could replay six independent <b>magnetic</b> <b>tapes,</b> with the speed and direction of each tape separately controllable. Le Caine's idea was to design an instrument to facilitate composition in the Parisian musique concrète tradition of Pierre Schaeffer. Following a successful fund-raising by Shalheveth Freier the Multi-track which was built for Tal's studio was completed and delivered to Jerusalem in 1961. It required a trip by Le Caine to set it up correctly.|$|E
500|$|The {{airport was}} largely used {{to fly to}} Longyearbyen, {{although}} {{a limited number of}} flights [...] were undertaken to the mainland.

On 3 June 1970, a miner with a fractured skull was transported by ship from Longyearbyen to Ny-Ålesund and sent on board a Piper PA-31 Navajo to the mainland for treatment. After the telemetry station closed in 1974, the airport was taken over by Kings Bay. During this period, Longyearbyen was served by a planed section of tundra in Adventdalen.|$|E

500|$|Following the 1962 mining {{accident}} {{and the subsequent}} Kings Bay Affair, Ny-Ålesund was transformed from a mining town to a research outpost.

The Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research needed to have an aviation connection with Longyearbyen to send <b>magnetic</b> <b>tapes</b> with the downloaded data to Germany.

2500|$|Prior to the {{availability}} of digital processing of seismic data in the late 1970s, the records were done in a few different forms on different types of media.

A [...] "Develocorder" [...] was a machine that record data from up to 20 channels into a 16-mm film. The recorded film can be viewed by a machine. The reading and measuring from these types of media can be done by hand.
