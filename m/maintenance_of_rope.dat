40|$|A wire <b>rope</b> because <b>of</b> its tensile {{strength}} and great flexibility (as mechanical properties of metal), {{and the availability}} in various sizes and types is used for construction, transportation and cargo handling machinery. Thus for, it appears that wire ropes are generally accepted expendable items (in contrast to irreplaceable items) and consequently the handling <b>of</b> wire <b>ropes</b> is somewhat thought lightly upon. Moreover, {{there is a tendency}} of twisting due to the great stretch <b>of</b> wire <b>ropes</b> and also become comparatively weak when lateral compression occurs. Consequently there should be caution in its use. The authors of this paper systematically investigated and analyzed an accident <b>of</b> wire <b>rope</b> which occured in Aza port, Naha City. The investigation included the investigation <b>of</b> operation <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> wire <b>rope</b> and the visual identification of the damaged part (pile driver engine, anvil, knob of pile driver engine, pully, damaged wires). Through a close examination the main factors of the probable cause of the accident were as follows. 1) The wire rope did not travel on its normal functional path but instead deviated and became caught on a knob of the engine. 2) There were scars on the knob caused by the wire rope during its movement on its deviated path. 3) The scars on the knob were obserbed as definite singular cuts caused by the wire rope each time it contacted the knob (on its deviated path). 4) The cause of the accident as determined by the authors, coincide with the testimony given by the workers who were present {{at the site of the}} accident. 5) The result of experiments with wire rope passed through a path with one axle having shapes other than a normal pully, the strength <b>of</b> the <b>rope</b> diminished by about 40 %. The five points listed above can be considered as the direct cause of the accident...|$|R
40|$|The boundary-value problem about {{construction}} of the displacement waves and the strain waves arising in <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> elevating devices, such as lifts, mine lifts and so on is considered. The <b>rope</b> at lifting <b>of</b> loads is reeled up on a drum. In a case when the friction coefficient <b>of</b> a <b>rope</b> about a drum is not too big, occurs frictional sliding a rope on a drum. Therefore the behavior <b>of</b> a <b>rope</b> on a drum is described by the telegraph equation. The behavior of a hanging part <b>of</b> a <b>rope</b> is described by the wave equation. It means, that in different parts <b>of</b> a <b>rope</b> the displacements are solutions of the different equations. That is from this point <b>of</b> view the <b>rope</b> is shared on two zones. Thus owing to reeling <b>of</b> a <b>rope</b> on a drum the border which shares these two zones is a variable. In such model the waves not only reflect from ending points <b>of</b> a <b>rope.</b> There is also their reflection and refraction on moving border of the sharing of zones. Is developed methods for obtaining of exact solutions for the boundary-value problems with mobile borders for both the wave and telegraph equations. They are based on <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> a continuity of the displacements in points of reflection of waves. The exact solution of such problem is obtained for the case <b>of</b> sagging a <b>rope</b> prior {{to the beginning of}} rise. </span...|$|R

In spite of mushrooming design improvement the malfunctioning of brakes is reported repeatedly, caused by handling mistakes or un-optimised design. This review article provides a detailed discussion of the evolution and the design <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes and introduces a new design classification. Design varieties are examined and addressed in detail. Subsequently, the mechanics <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes are reviewed and the differences between dynamic and static belaying are compared as to static and kinetic friction as well as belt and linear friction. In this critical review of modelling and testing <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes, we discuss misconceptions as well as improvements. The issues covered in this review article aim to highlight the problems and challenges which the design <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes and belay devices is facing in the quest for developing an optimised brake which never fails and which is ready to use without training. The shortcomings of modelling and testing <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes are mainly due to neglecting kinetic friction, which disadvantageously affects design optimisation but also opens design opportunities...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we present a unified way to smooth certain {{multiple}} structures called ropes on smooth varieties. We prove that most <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> arbitrary multiplicity, supported on smooth curves can be smoothed. By a rope being smoothable we mean that the rope is the flat limit {{of a family of}} smooth, irreducible curves. To construct a smoothing, we connect, on the one hand, deformations of a finite morphism to projective space and, on the other hand, morphisms from a rope to projective space. We also prove a general result of independent interest, namely, finite covers onto smooth irreducible curves embedded in projective space can be deformed to a family of 1 : 1 maps. We apply our general theory to prove the smoothing <b>of</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> 3 on P^ 1.
