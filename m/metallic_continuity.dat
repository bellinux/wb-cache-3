Babbage and Herschel[A], now receive their natural explanation, as well also as the resumption of power when the cuts were filled up by metallic substances, which, though conductors of electricity, were themselves very deficient {{in the power of}} influencing magnets. And new modes of cutting the plate may be devised, which shall almost entirely destroy its power. Thus, if a copper plate (81.) be cut through at about a fifth or sixth of its diameter from the edge, so as to separate a ring from it, and this ring be again fastened on, but with a thickness of paper intervening (fig. 29.), and if Arago's experiment be made with this compound plate so adjusted that the section shall continually travel opposite the pole, it is evident that the magnetic currents will be greatly interfered with, and the plate probably lose much of its effect[B].|$|E
40|$|There is {{a general}} demand to {{decrease}} the weight of vehicles. This fact has to be considered by current and future body concepts. State of the art car body concepts require a high structural performance combined with a low weight of the component. This demand can be met by hybrid parts, which offer {{the advantage of a}} material mix, combining the advantageous properties of the composite partners. The high freedom of construction and geometric shape in primary shaping processes enables joining sheet metal structures to a complex cast structure stiffening the hybrid component and increasing the structural performance. The topic {{of this paper is to}} identify casting alloys, steel sheets and steel sheet coatings which enable the production of high quality hybrid structures for body applications in wet area. Therefore the materials have to achieve defined requirements. Casting alloys which have to be used for thin wall hybrid structures need to have a very well castability, a good corrosion resistance, good mechanical properties including a good ductility and a good weldability. To save costs and to reduce residual stress in hybrid components alloys have to be used which show a self-hardening effect. Because of stiffening the hybrid component an almost defect-free casting component is needed. Therefore casting alloys which have been used for composite castings have to show a good castability. The casting alloys AlMg 5 Si 2 Mn and AlSi 9 Mn seem to have the potential to achieve these require-ments. A comparison of both alloys showed that the alloy AlSi 9 Mn has some advantages over the alloy AlMg 5 SiMn. The alloy has a higher castability and causes less residual stress in hybrid components. Casting ribs which are given to stabilize hybrid structures often show characteristic shrinkage porosity with a thread-shaped morphology when the alloy AlMg 5 Si 2 Mn was used. A higher residual stress caused by the alloy AlMg 5 Si 2 Mn is believed by the alloys higher thermal expansion coefficient. Because of the advantages of the alloy AlSi 9 Mn towards the alloy AlMg 5 Si 2 Mn the alloy AlSi 9 Mn was preferred for the production of hybrid components. Beside the choice of a casting material the micro-alloyed steel ZStE 420 was chosen. This steel material is often used for crash relevant structure parts and shows in combination with coatings a good corrosion resistance. Furthermore the micro-alloyed steel shows a hot temperature resistance for short term which is important when the steel material gets into contact with the molten casting alloy. Using hybrid parts in wet area both materials, casting and steel alloy, need to show a good corrosion resistance itself. To avoid contact corrosion it is necessary that a corrosion current between both materials cannot take place. Therefore it can be very helpful to realize a complete <b>metallic</b> <b>continuity</b> between both materials. To create a <b>metallic</b> <b>continuity</b> a sufficient diffusion time between the material partners is needed. Using technical casting processes like the high pressure die casting process there is only a very limited solidification time and therefore a very limited diffusion time. To overcome this problem defined coating systems were checked. It could be shown that especially Zinc-coatings (electrogalvanising and hot-dip galvanizing) are able to create a <b>metallic</b> <b>continuity</b> between steel and casting component. Nevertheless a complete <b>metallic</b> <b>continuity</b> was not received. Furthermore mechanical tests were conducted to analyze the failure mechanism of hybrid structures with and without <b>metallic</b> <b>continuity.</b> It could be shown that at early deformation trajectories hybrid structures without <b>metallic</b> <b>continuity</b> take up more energy than hybrid structure with <b>metallic</b> <b>continuity.</b> The behavior changes with increasing deformation trajectories...|$|E
40|$|Deficits of {{mechanical}} joining technologies {{in comparison with}} <b>metallic</b> <b>continuity</b> joining methods are the rough estimated design parameters, that the complex load and form closure, for example lockbolt and blind rivet joints, not sufficiently put in strengths relevant parameters. In the article a simplifying stiffness based calculation method is introduced, that {{on the one hand}} reduces the test complexity for the parameter calculation {{and on the other hand}} establishes a reliable yield load based design parameter in practice...|$|E

This fact {{is due to the}} continuity conditions of the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields, at the interface. As a consequence, we have the continuity of voltage and current in the equivalent transmission line.Thus the transverse resonance method automatically takes into account the boundary conditions at the <b>metallic</b> walls and <b>continuity</b> conditions at the air-dielectric interface.|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{structure}} of partially reduced lead-silicate glasses using combined EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) and MD (molecular dynamics) methods. The analysis was performed for glasses of x[(l - p) Pb pPbO] (I - X) SiO 2 composition, x = 0. 3, 0. 5, 0. 7, where parameter (I - p) describes the degree of reduction, i. e. {{the content of the}} granular metallic phase, appearing {{as the result of the}} reduction process (e. g. annealing in hydrogen atmosphere). In the EXAFS experiment (1 - p) was expressed via the time of reduction realized at 400 degrees C (1. 5 It, 24 It, 70 h), whereas in the MD simulations it was determined precisely by using proper numbers of particles (corresponding to (1 - p) = 0. 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 0). In the paper we describe in detail the local structure around lead atoms and its changes in the function of glass composition and reduction degree. The tendency for agglomeration of Pb- 0 into clusters, the formation of the granular <b>metallic</b> phase, and <b>continuity</b> of silica and lead oxide subnetworks are discussed. A good agreement between EXAFS-extractcd and MD-extracted parameters of the short-range structure encouraged us to preform a medium-range order analysis, based on the MD simulations only. Moreover, combining the EXAFS and MD methods we could correlate the reduction time (technological parameter) with the degree of reduction (I - p) and the actual state of the granular structure. The latter relation may be useful for controlled production of reduced glasses of pre-requested physical properties. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The joining of {{different}} materials and material combinations can be occur either <b>metallic</b> <b>continuity</b> like welding, bonding and soldering or also on a form-fit and frictional continuity {{like in the}} screwing and rivets. The mechanical connection offers a large potential to join different materials without thermal loading. The lockbolt (SRB) as a high-strength friction grip fastening system represents in this regard a synthesis between full rivet and screw. They find in practice many applications. Computation references, norms and regulations for a comprehensive employment are only limited available or rather missing completely, that´s why potential users can often not use this alternative joining technology. Analysed are setting behavior and selective strength properties of lockbolts with numeric computations as a contribution to advance the determination of these properties for constructive dimensioning and to compare with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of dissimilar materials like brass {{and stainless steel}} is often needed in watch movements due to tribologic aspects. For mass production in automotive applications, a joining technique for alloyed copper with alloyed steel is needed. Laser beam micro welding offers an alternative to conventional joining techniques like press fit or soldering. Depending on the joining geometry, two different welding techniques are investigated: seam and spot welding. High strength and reproducibility are the main objective of joining dissimilar metals. Cracks and spillings {{are affected by the}} <b>metallic</b> <b>continuity</b> and should be avoided. Lap- and T-joints can be produced by the SHADOW-Welding technique. The length of the continuous welding seams are up to 15. 7 mm at a feed rate of up to 60 m/min with a pulsed laser source. The weld width attained ranges from 50 to 250 µm and a weld depth from 20 to 150 µm. This low energy joining process with minimized heat input results in low distortion of the parts joined. Applying spot welding, the pulse forming capability is needed especially for highly reflective metals like copper. The welded joints have a higher strength than the basic material...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid {{components}} {{become more}} and more important in light weight production. Joining different materials is very promising to meet today’s technical and economical demands. By high pressure composite casting, metal hybrids with excellent light weight and structural properties are producible. In this context, this work focusses on recasting metal sheets with light metal alloys. Both material and casting process are analyzed and characterized for a better comprehension in terms of development and production of metal-metal hybrids. Ensuing from metal sheets’ and casting materials’ fundamentals, the used materials and existing concepts for light weight metal hybrids are described. Moreover the influence of the casting heat on the properties of the metal sheets and the influence of the surface treatment on the interface as well as the interaction between the different materials are investigated. Found principles could successfully be transferred to a close-to-production automotive demonstrator. Typical defects in cast metal hybrids are characterized and referred to their causes. The deduced optimization measures are applicable to further developments on metal hybrids. Results from destructive and non-destructive tests are appraised with respect to the joint. On the basis of this data a new concept for a quality control of metal-metal hybrids in a potential full-scale production was developed. Furthermore the effect of heat depending on the choice of materials, the casting system {{and the size of the}} cast part was analyzed to provide a basis for the control of distortion. By light metallography and SEM the formation of the boundary layer of steel sheet – aluminum casting and aluminum sheet – magnesium casting was characterized. As a result, <b>metallic</b> <b>continuity</b> and form closure could specifically be influenced. For a better connection an innovative surface patterning was devised, which leads to an effective micro bracing and thus to a much better material junction...|$|E
