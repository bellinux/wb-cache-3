A day later the readings in the first well were 11 kBq/L of 134Cs and 22 kBq/L of 137Cs, 111 times and 105 times greater than the samples of 5 July.

25|$|Originally, CRREL cold-room {{facilities}} used trichloroethylene (TCE) as a refrigerant. At {{the time there}} were few known environmental hazards attributed to TCE. Subsequently, TCE {{has been identified as}} a carcinogen. In 1970, an industrial accident resulted in a spill of approximately 3,000 gallons of TCE. In 1978, TCE was introduced into the ground via an experimental well. After the 1990 discovery of TCE in groundwater, CRREL embarked on a remediation plan, approved by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES), with assistance from the U.S. Army Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency and the Corps of Engineers New England Division. NHDES reports that CRREL no longer stores TCE on site and the remediation of TCE in the groundwater is subject to monitoring in test wells. According to an Army press release cited in the local newspaper, the Army expanded monitoring of TCE at other locations on the CRREL campus and found some elevated readings in 2011. Thereafter, they initiated a <b>monitoring</b> <b>well</b> and soil sampling program to map the concentrations of the substance on the site. The information gained should lead to a new cleanup strategy for the site, according to the 2012 report. Army environmental specialists have detected TCE at neighboring residential and school properties.|$|E

40|$|This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether}} measurements of groundwater parameters obtained using direct-push wells are comparable to those obtained from conventional <b>monitoring</b> <b>wells.</b> Direct-push <b>monitoring</b> <b>wells</b> contained no filter pack and were pushed into the subsurface; conventional <b>monitoring</b> <b>wells</b> contained filter packs and were installed with typical drilling and completion methods.

The study was conducted at two sites in Ohio and two sites in Georgia and they were chosen {{so there was a}} wide-range of soils, conductivities, and concentrations. The following conclusions can be drawn: Groundwater levels measured in conventional versus direct-push <b>monitoring</b> <b>wells</b> are nearly identical.

50|$|A well cluster, also {{referred}} to as a <b>monitoring</b> <b>well</b> cluster, consists of multiple co-located monitoring wells that are constructed with intakes (well screens) at different depths in the subsurface. The purpose of a well cluster is to provide groundwater samples from discrete depths at approximately the same location. Also, water levels can be measured in each individual <b>monitoring</b> <b>well,</b> providing vertical profiles of groundwater pressure (hydraulic head). Well clusters are different from nested wells in that each <b>monitoring</b> <b>well</b> is constructed in a separate borehole, as opposed to multiple well casings in a single borehole which is the case with nested wells). A key advantage of a well cluster over a nested well is that there is less potential for vertical leakage and hydraulic short-circuiting because reliable annular seals are installed in each separate borehole in the cluster. However, well clusters require drilling multiple boreholes, which results in higher construction costs compared to nested wells. Economical alternatives to well clusters are multilevel groundwater monitoring systems, {{also referred}} to as engineered nested wells.|$|E
