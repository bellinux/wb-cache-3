5|$|COPD often occurs {{along with}} a number of other {{conditions}}, due in part to shared risk factors. These conditions include ischemic heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, <b>muscle</b> <b>wasting,</b> osteoporosis, lung cancer, anxiety disorder, sexual dysfunction, and depression. In those with severe disease, a feeling of always being tired is common. Fingernail clubbing is not specific to COPD and should prompt investigations for an underlying lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General <b>muscle</b> <b>wasting</b> that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E

40|$|Tissue protein hypercatabolism (TPH) {{is a most}} {{important}} feature in cancer cachexia, {{particularly with regard to}} the skeletal muscle. The rat ascites hepatoma Yoshida AH- 130 is a very suitable model system for studying the mechan-isms involved in the processes that lead to tissue depletion, since it induces in the host a rapid and progressive <b>muscle</b> <b>waste</b> mainly due to TPH (Tessitore, L., G. Bonelli, and F. M. Baccino. 1987. Biochem. J. 241 : 153 - 159). Detectable plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-a associated with marked perturbations in the hormonal homeostasis have been shown to concur in forcing metabolism into a catabolic setting (Tessitore, L., P. Costelli, and F. M. Baccino. 1993. Br. J. Cancer. 67 : 15 - 23). The present study was directed to investigate if. 2 -adrenergic agonists, which are known to favor skeletal muscle hypertrophy, could effectively antago-nize the enhanced muscle protein breakdown in this cancer cachexia model. One such agent, i. e., clenbuterol, indeed largely prevented skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>waste</b> in AH- 130 -bearing rats by restoring protein degradative rates close to control values. This normalization of protein breakdown rates was achieved through a decrease of the hyperactivation of the ATP-ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway, as pre-viously demonstrated in our laboratory (Llovera, M., C...|$|R
40|$|Heart {{failure is}} a {{syndrome}} {{leading to a}} skeletal myopathy with muscle atrophy and shift toward fast contracting fibres. It {{has been shown that}} the major cause of atrophy is <b>muscle</b> <b>waste</b> due to skeletal muscle myonuclei apoptosis. Apoptosis is triggered by circulating cytokines and their second messengers, in particular sphingolipids. We report here several attempts to block apoptosis. Thalidomide, an inhibitor of TNFα biosynthesis, was used without success. More successful was the attempt with blocking the Angiotensin II receptors in that apoptosis and atrophy could be prevented. Another useful approach was the block of the apoptotic cascade involving sphyngomyelinase and caspases. This was done both in vivo and in vitro with a natural occurring substance: carnitine, that {{has been shown to be}} able to block both sphyngomyelinase and caspases. Aim of our previous studies was also to shed some light on the pathophysiology of the heart failure myopathy, but at the same time to see whether apoptosis could be inhibited with subsequent prevention of the myopathy (atrophy and MHCs shift) and improvement of exercise capacity and symptoms. Since these data suggest that it is possible to block the apoptotic cascade and prevent <b>muscle</b> <b>waste</b> and atrophy, the next step is to push research into heart failure in humans and maybe to other myopathies in which it has been shown that apoptosis plays a determinant role in producing myocyte loss...|$|R
40|$|The {{implantation}} of the Lewis lung carcinoma (a fast-growing mouse tumour that induces cachexia) to both wild-type and transgenic mice for the soluble TNF receptor type I protein (sTNF-R 1) {{resulted in}} a considerable loss of carcass weight in both groups. However, while in the wild-type mice there was a loss of both fat and muscle, in the transgenic mice <b>muscle</b> <b>waste</b> was not affected {{to the same extent}} as in the wild-type group. <b>Muscle</b> <b>waste</b> in wild-type mice was accompanied by an increase in the fractional rate of protein degradation, while no changes were observed in protein synthesis. The result was a decreased rate of protein accumulation which accounted for the muscle weight loss observed {{as a result of the}} tumour burden. In contrast, transgenic mice did not have such low rates of protein accumulation after tumour implantation. The increase in protein degradation in the tumour-bearing transgenic mice was accompanied by a similar increase in protein synthesis which compensated for the loss of muscle protein by degradation. Both tumour-bearing groups showed an enhanced expression of ubiquitin and proteasome C 8 subunit genes, all of them related to the activation of the ATP-dependent proteolytic system in skeletal muscle. It is suggested that TNF may, in part, be responsible for the loss of protein in skeletal muscle of tumour-bearing mice...|$|R

25|$|Elevated {{levels of}} cortisol, if prolonged, {{can lead to}} {{proteolysis}} (breakdown of proteins) and <b>muscle</b> <b>wasting.</b> Several {{studies have shown that}} cortisol can have a lipolytic effect (promote the breakdown of fat).

50|$|Symptoms and {{progression}} of the disease can vary. Involuntary grinding of teeth as well as squinting are prevalent and often go unnoticed by the person affected. Breathing can be affected in some; so can hearing, vision, {{as well as the}} neck and shoulder muscles. Scoliosis is common, causing hunching and loss of height. Hip sockets can be malformed. Gastrointestinal problems can be part of CMT, as can difficulty chewing, swallowing, and speaking (due to atrophy of vocal cords). A tremor can develop as <b>muscles</b> <b>waste.</b> Pregnancy has been known to exacerbate CMT, as well as severe emotional stress. Patients with CMT must avoid periods of prolonged immobility such as when recovering from a secondary injury as prolonged periods of limited mobility can drastically accelerate symptoms of CMT.|$|R
25|$|MSA is {{distinct}} from multisystem proteinopathy, a more common <b>muscle</b> <b>wasting</b> syndrome. It should also {{not be confused with}} multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (sometimes referred to as multiple organ failure), or with multiple organ system failure (an often-fatal complication of septic shock or other very severe illnesses or injuries).|$|E
25|$|A {{small but}} {{controlled}} study of GH given to severely ill adults in an {{intensive care unit}} setting {{for the purpose of}} increasing strength and reducing the <b>muscle</b> <b>wasting</b> of critical illness showed a higher mortality rate for the patients having received GH. The reason is unknown, but GH is now rarely used in ICU patients unless they have severe growth hormone deficiency.|$|E
25|$|The {{equivalent}} {{nitrogen content}} (in gram) of urea (in mmol) {{can be estimated}} by the conversion factor 0.028 g/mmol. Furthermore, 1gram of nitrogen is roughly equivalent to 6.25grams of protein, and 1gram of protein is roughly equivalent to 5grams of muscle tissue. In situations such as <b>muscle</b> <b>wasting,</b> 1mmol of excessive urea in the urine (as measured by urine volume in litres multiplied by urea concentration in mmol/l) roughly corresponds to a muscle loss of 0.67gram.|$|E

25|$|Marasmus (‘to waste away’) {{is caused}} by an {{inadequate}} intake of protein and energy. The main symptoms are severe wasting, leaving little or no edema, minimal subcutaneous fat, severe <b>muscle</b> <b>wasting,</b> and non-normal serum albumin levels. Marasmus can result from a sustained diet of inadequate energy and protein, and the metabolism adapts to prolong survival. It is traditionally seen in famine, significant food restriction, or more severe cases of anorexia. Conditions are characterized by extreme wasting of the muscles and a gaunt expression.|$|E
25|$|Sensory {{symptoms}} are gradually followed by motor symptoms. Motor symptoms may include muscle cramps and weakness, erectile dysfunction in men, problems urinating, constipation, and diarrhea. Individuals also may experience <b>muscle</b> <b>wasting</b> and decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes. Some people may experience frequent falls and gait unsteadiness due to ataxia. This ataxia {{may be caused}} by cerebellar degeneration, sensory ataxia, or distal muscle weakness. Over time, alcoholic polyneuropathy may also cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), speech impairment (disarthria), muscle spasms, and muscle atrophy.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors include}} obesity, {{repetitive}} wrist work, pregnancy, and rheumatoid arthritis. There is tentative evidence that hypothyroidism increases the risk. Diabetes mellitus is weakly associated with CTS. The use {{of birth control}} pills {{does not affect the}} risk. Types of work that are associated include computer work, work with vibrating tools, and work that requires a strong grip. Diagnosis is suspected based on signs, symptoms, and specific physical tests and may be confirmed with electrodiagnostic tests. If <b>muscle</b> <b>wasting</b> {{at the base of the}} thumb is present, the diagnosis is likely.|$|E
50|$|Hollowing in the supraspinatous and the infraspinatous area is {{frequently}} seen as chronic rotator cuff tear resulting in wasting. The wasting {{may be caused}} by the supraglenoid cyst compressing the suprascapular nerve and causes a loss of innervation to supraspinatus and infraspinatus <b>muscles.</b> Such <b>wasting</b> or hollowing can be differentially diagnosed as nerve compression or tendon rupture.|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} (MV) {{in chronic}} situations is commonly used, either delivered invasively or {{by means of}} non-invasive interfaces, to control hypoventilation in patients with chest wall, neuromuscular or obstructive lung diseases (either in adulthood or childhood). The global prevalence of ventilator-assisted individuals (VAI) in Europe ranges from 2 to 30 per 100000 population according to different countries. Nutrition is a common problem to face with in patients with chronic respiratory diseases: nonetheless, it is a key component in the long-term management of underweight COPD patients whose muscular disfunction may rapidly turn to peripheral <b>muscle</b> <b>waste.</b> Since long-term mechanical ventilation (LTMV) is usually prescribed in end-stage respiratory diseases with poor nutritional status, nutrition and dietary intake related problems need to be carefully assessed and corrected in these patients. This paper aims to review the most recent innovations {{in the field of}} nutritional status and food intake-related problems of VAI (both in adulthood and in childhood) ...|$|R
25|$|Lengthy fasting can be {{dangerous}} due {{to the risk of}} malnutrition and should be carried out only under medical supervision. During prolonged fasting or very low calorie diets the reduction of blood glucose, the preferred energy source of the brain, causes the body to deplete its glycogen stores. Once glycogen is depleted the body begins to fuel the brain using ketones, while also metabolizing body protein (including but not limited to skeletal muscle) to be used to synthesize sugars for use as energy {{by the rest of the}} body. Most experts believe that a prolonged fast can lead to <b>muscle</b> <b>wasting,</b> although some dispute this. The use of short-term fasting, or various forms of intermittent fasting have been used as a form of dieting to circumvent this issue.|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} percentage of patients with end-stage renal disease are malnourished and/or <b>muscle</b> <b>wasted.</b> Uremia is associated with decreased protein synthesis and increased protein degradation. Fortunately, nutritional status {{has been shown to}} be a modifiable risk factor in the dialysis population. It has long been proposed that exercise could positively alter the protein synthesis-degradation balance. Resistance training had been considered as the only form of exercise likely to induce anabolism in renal failure patients. However, a small, but growing, body of evidence indicates that for some dialysis patients, favourable improvements in muscle atrophy and fibre hypertrophy can be achieved via predominantly aerobic exercise training. Moreover, some studies tentatively suggest that nutritional status, as measured by SGA, can also be modestly improved by modes and patterns of exercise training that have been shown to also increase muscle fibre cross-sectional area and improve functionalcapacity. Functional capacity tests can augment the information content of basic nutritional status assessments of dialysis patients and as such are recommended for routine inclusion as a feature of all nutritional status assessments...|$|R

40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a {{neurodegenerative disease}} characterized {{by the death of}} motor neurons. Once these nerve cells die, the patient’s <b>muscles</b> <b>waste</b> away, resulting in paralysis and eventually death. Two primary forms of ALS exist: Familial and Sporadic. Familial constitutes 5 - 10 % of cases and is defined by ALS being present in one or more cases in a family’s lineage. Sporadic makes up 90 - 95 % of ALS cases and is essentially when no family history exists with ALS but an individual has ALS. Mutations in SOD 1 have been the most studied in regards to ALS. However there are many other genes linked to ALS that have not been studied. VCP is a gene that has been linked to several different diseases including familial versions of ALS. The protein has been linked to many different cellular processes including protein degradation and programmed cell death. To gain a better understanding into the development and eventual death of motor neurons, we are using both TAL-effector nuclease (TALEN) mediated mutagenesis and a VCP CRSPR to create zebrafish that are mutant for VCP. These mutant fish will hopefully allow us to create a new model of motor neuron degeneration or ALS...|$|R
