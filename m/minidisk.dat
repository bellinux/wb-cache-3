40|$|Advanced {{turbine engine}} {{configurations}} using higher temperature combustor and airfoil concepts require compressor and turbine disks that can withstand temperatures {{higher than the}} 650 C typical of current engines. This requires disk alloy and processing improvements. A versatile disk alloy was needed that could be given either fine grain heat treatments for high strength and fatigue and creep resistance up to 704 C or given coarse grain heat treatments for high strength and creep and dwell crack-growth resistance at higher temperatures. This alloy could produce disks with uniform microstructures and properties, {{as well as with}} varied, optimized microstructures at disk bore and rim sections. A series of experimental disk alloys were designed and processed to give subscale disks about 13 cm in diameter and 4 cm thick. These alloys had varying levels of key elements to affect mechanical properties and change the "solvus" solution heat-treatment temperature necessary to produce coarse grain microstructures. Disks were given coarse grain heat treatments followed by rapid oil quenching and slower fan air quenching. These heat treatments were intended to simulate the cooling paths of rapidly cooled full-scale disks at the outermost rim and interior bore locations, respectively. Preliminary quench tests of tensile specimens and coin-size <b>minidisks</b> had indicated that alloys having high solvus temperatures were more prone to cracking during rapid quenching from coarse grain heat treatments. These findings were confirmed in the subscale disks, where such alloys did form undesirable quench cracks. Mechanical tests were performed on specimens from subscale disks given these coarse grain heat treatments, as well as on specimens given a fine grain heat treatment. Tensile, creep, and crack growth tests were performed at 704 C and higher temperatures. A versatile alloy was identified that had a low solvus temperature for resistance to quench cracking as well as an optimal combination of high levels of strengthening refractory elements that produced balanced high mechanical properties for both fine grain and coarse grain microstructures. This low-solvus, high-refractory (LSHR) alloy has been scaled-up to produce prototype full-scale turbine disks typical of regional jet turbofan engines. Disks were successfully heat treated to give uniform coarse grain and uniform fine grain microstructures. Additional disks were given a NASA dual microstructure heat treatment (DMHT) that intentionally varied the solution heat-treatment temperatures between the disk rim and bore (re f. 1). The disk rim was heated to a high enough temperature to produce a coarse grain microstructure, while the bore was maintained at a lower temperature to produce a fine grain microstructure (see the figure). This DMHT can produce optimal high strength, fatigue, and creep resistance up to 704 C in the cooler running disk bore, and high strength, creep resistance, and dwell crack growth resistance at higher temperatures for the hotter disk rim. Extensive mechanical testing is being initiated to compare the mechanical properties of the uniform and DMHT disks...|$|R

40|$|Newtonian {{simulations}} {{have demonstrated}} that accretion onto binary black holes produces accretion disks around each black hole ("minidisks"), fed by gas streams flowing through the circumbinary cavity from the surrounding circumbinary disk. We study the dynamics and radiation of an individual black hole <b>minidisk</b> using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations performed with a new general relativistic version of the moving mesh code Disco. We introduce a co-moving energy variable which enables highly accurate integration of these high Mach number flows. Tidally induced spiral shock waves are excited in the disk and propagate through the ISCO providing a Reynolds stress which causes efficient accretion by purely hydrodynamic means and producing a radiative signature brighter in hard X-rays than the Novikov-Thorne model. Disk cooling is provided by a local blackbody prescription that allows the disk to evolve self-consistently to a temperature profile where hydrodynamic heating is balanced by radiative cooling. We find that the spiral shock structure is {{in agreement with the}} relativistic dispersion relation for tightly-wound linear waves. We measure the shock induced dissipation and find outward angular momentum transport corresponding to an effective alpha parameter of order 0. 01. We perform ray-tracing image calculations from the simulations to produce theoretical <b>minidisk</b> spectra and viewing angle dependent images for comparison with observations.

40|$|Water {{infiltration}} {{into the}} soil profile, surface runoff and soil erosion in arable lands depend on {{the conditions of the}} top layer. The tillage treatment of the top layer {{plays a key role in}} changes of the hydro-physical properties, mainly saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks of the surface layer. The aim of this study was to asses the impact of different tillage treatments on hydraulic conductivity in the locality Bohaté Málkovice. Field experimental works in this area were performed in 2009 and were repeted in 2011 on Haplic Chernozem, medium heavy loamy soil. The experimental area was divided into two parts; top layer of these plots was cultivated by applying conventional and reduced tillage treatment. Both these plots were sown with spring barley (Hordeum vulgare). For the field measurement of water infiltration {{into the soil}} was used double-ring infiltrometer (2009, 2011) and <b>Minidisk</b> infiltrometer (2011). Near the point were the infiltration was measured, the soil samples were always collected for laboratory determination of basic physical properties of soil (bulk density, porosity, initial and saturated water content, aeration of the soil) and saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks. For laboratory determination of Ks was used permeameter with constant gradient. For evaluation of saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks using the double-ring infiltration method was used Philip’s three-parameter equation and for evaluation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity K(h) using <b>Minidisk</b> infiltrometer was used Zang’s method. After two years of using repeatedly applied different tillage treatments was significantly influenced saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks. The Ks value increased approximately six times for reduced tillage and more than three times for conventional tillage. Laboratory determined average values of Ks were compared with the average estimates of Ks from infiltration tests. The results were burdened by a number of errors (compaction, preferential flow). These mean values were higher for conventional and reduced tillage. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity K(− 2 cm) for reduced tillage was higher, for conventional tillage decreased approximately three times...|$|E

In this work, an integrated LC–MS method for selective, sensitive and reproducible analysis of phosphorylation in proteins has been applied to AF. Online digestion of (phospho) proteins was coupled with the selective enrichment on a TiO 2 trap, and separated by RPLC–MSn of both normal and phosphorylated produced peptides. First, an AF-pooled sample was analyzed and a general map of contained proteins and biomarkers was derived in a single run.

40|$|Interpretation of {{compression}} stress-relaxation (CSR) experiments for elastomers in air {{is complicated}} by (1) the presence of both physical and chemical relaxation and (2) anomalous diffusion-limited oxidation (DLO) effects. For a butyl material, the authors first use shear relaxation data to indicate that physical relaxation effects are negligible during typical high temperature CSR experiments. They then show that experiments on standard CSR samples ({approximately} 15 mm diameter when compressed) lead to complex non-Arrhenius behavior. By combining reaction kinetics based on the historic basic autoxidation scheme with a diffusion equation appropriate to disk-shaped samples, they derive a theoretical DLO model appropriate to CSR experiments. Using oxygen consumption and permeation rate measurements, the theory shows that important DLO effects {{are responsible for the}} observed non-Arrhenius behavior. To minimize DLO effects, they introduce a new CSR methodology based on the use of numerous small disk samples strained in parallel. Results from these parallel, <b>minidisk</b> experiments lead to Arrhenius behavior with an activation energy consistent with values commonly observed for elastomers, allowing more confident extrapolated predictions. In addition, excellent correlation is noted between the CSR force decay and the oxygen consumption rate, consistent with the expectation that oxidative scission processes dominate the CSR results...|$|E

Examination was performed on 30 subjects who had been wearing removable partial dentures in the upper and/or lower jaw and on 30 subjects in the control group.

40|$|In this work, {{the water}} vapor {{oxidation}} of Al-bearing III-V compound semiconductors {{is used to}} fabricate light-emitting and electronic devices. High Al-composition heterostructure crystals such as Al xGa 1 -xAs (x ∼> 0. 5) are converted into a stable native oxide at moderately elevated temperatures (∼> 400 ∘C) in a water vapor saturated ambient. Dependence of the oxidation process on Al composition makes possible the formation of embedded oxide layers in between semiconductor crystal using selective (lateral) oxidation. Data are presented showing how various growth parameters, crystal layering, and oxidation times and temperatures affect the lateral oxidation process. Etch studies of superlattice structures that are Zn-diffused and oxidized are also presented showing that the water vapor oxidation process behaves similarly to chemical wet etches. Native oxide-based AlGaAs-GaAs metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor devices are fabricated via lateral oxidation of a thin AlAs layer. Data are presented demonstrating depletion-mode transistor operation. This shows that the native oxide is of sufficient quality to allow modulation of an underlying GaAs channel.

40|$|We present {{analysis}} of the first Chandra observation of PSO J 334. 2028 + 01. 4075 (PSO J 334), targeted as a binary-AGN candidate based on periodic variations of the optical flux. With no prior targeted X-ray coverage for PSO J 334, our new 40 ksec Chandra observation allows {{for the opportunity to}} differentiate between a single or binary-AGN system, and if a binary, can characterize the mode of accretion. Simulations show that the two expected accretion disk morphologies for binary-AGN systems are (i) a "cavity", where the inner region of the accretion disk is mostly empty and emission is truncated blueward of the wavelength associated with the temperature of the innermost ring, or (ii) "minidisks", where there is substantial accretion from the cirumbinary disk onto {{one or both of the}} members of the binary, each with their own shock-heated thin-disk accretion system. We find the X-ray emission to be well-fit with an absorbed power-law, incompatible with the simple cavity scenario. Further, we construct an SED of PSO J 334 by combining radio through X-ray observations and find that the SED agrees well with that of a normal AGN, most likely incompatible with the <b>minidisk</b> scenario. Other analyses, such as locating the quasar on IR color-color diagrams and analyzing the quasar mass predicted by the fundamental plane of black hole activity, further highlight the similarity of PSO J 334 with respect to normal AGN. On the multi-wavelength fronts we investigated, we find no evidence supporting PSO J 334 as a binary-AGN system, though our analysis remains insensitive to some binary configurations.
