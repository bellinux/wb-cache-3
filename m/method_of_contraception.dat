There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching. In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm as a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraception,</b> they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E

Three groups of subjects rated the similarity <b>of</b> seventeen <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraception,</b> and also rated each method on a number of adjective scales. Multidimensional scaling of the similarity judgments revealed two dimensions: one related to effectiveness, expense, and safety, and the other differentiating between standard and non-standard <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraception</b> (or natural and non-natural ones). In addition, <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraception</b> were arrayed in the space mainly on the basis of physical similarity. Analyses of the rating scales indicated that subjects perceived methods accurately in terms of effectiveness, but were inaccurate in their ratings of safety to the user. Finally, analysis of individual differences indicated that the second dimension was more salient to younger than to older subjects, but did not reveal differences related to religion or contraceptive use...|$|R

25|$|Lack {{of use of}} {{contraceptives}} {{contributes to}} this high pregnancy rate. Out of all sexually active female adolescents, only 7% utilize condoms and only 47% use any modern <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraception.</b> A highly tradition-based culture, a conservative government, and the Catholic Church's domination have been observed to negatively impact contraceptive use. Educational promotion of contraception is generally only conducted by nongovernmental agencies or women's groups, and it is popular belief amongst many that various forms of contraceptive methods are detrimental to one's health.|$|E

25|$|Oral sex alone cannot {{result in}} {{pregnancy}} and heterosexual couples may perform oral sex as their <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraception.</b> For conception to take place, sperm from the penis must enter the uterus and fallopian tubes and fertilize the female's egg. In humans, {{there is no}} connection between the gastrointestinal system and the reproductive system, and sperm ingested by the woman would be killed and broken down by acids in her stomach and proteins in the small intestine. The breakdown products are then absorbed as a negligible quantity of nutrients. However, {{there is a potential}} risk of pregnancy if semen comes in contact with the vaginal area in some way, such as semen in the ejaculate finding its way onto fingers, hands, or other body parts, which then comes in contact with the vaginal area.|$|E
500|$|The church {{teaches that}} sexual {{intercourse}} should only take place between {{a married man}} and woman, and should be {{without the use of}} birth control or contraception. In his encyclical Humanae vitae (1968), Pope Paul VI firmly rejected all contraception, thus contradicting dissenters in the Church that saw the birth control pill as an ethically justifiable <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraception,</b> though he permitted the regulation of births by means of natural family planning. This teaching was continued especially by John Paul II in his encyclical Evangelium Vitae, where he clarified the Church's position on contraception, abortion and euthanasia by condemning them as part of a [...] "culture of death" [...] and calling instead for a [...] "culture of life".|$|E
500|$|To {{optimise}} women's {{control over}} pregnancy, {{it is essential}} that culturally appropriate contraceptive advice and means are widely, easily, and affordably available to anyone that is sexually active, including adolescents. In {{many parts of the world}} access to contraception and family planning services is very difficult or non existent and even in developed counties cultural and religious traditions can create barriers to access. Reported usage of adequate contraception by women has risen only slightly between 1990 and 2014, with considerable regional variability. Although global usage is around 55%, it may be as low as 25% in Africa. Worldwide 222 million women have no or limited access to contraception. Some caution is needed in interpreting available data, since contraceptive prevalence is often defined as [...] "the percentage of women currently using any <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraception</b> among all women of reproductive age (i.e., those aged 15 to 49 years, unless otherwise stated) who are married or in a union. The “in-union” group includes women living with their partner in the same household and who are not married according to the marriage laws or customs of a country." [...] This definition is more suited to the more restrictive concept of family planning, but omits the contraceptive needs of all other women and girls who are or are likely to be sexually active, are at risk of pregnancy and are not married or [...] "in-union".|$|E

He got histories that included information about how the women had reacted to their death sentences, how well they had adjusted to prison life, and the timing of their menstrual cycles. Based on this information he wrote 230 papers {{on the effect of}} stress on the female reproductive system. Women facing execution ovulated less predictably, he found, and sometimes experienced what he called [...] "shock bleedings".

40|$|Adoption <b>of</b> {{long-term}} <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraception,</b> including intrauterine devices, implants, and injectable birth control, {{has increased}} substantially {{over the last}} decade. While these methods are the most effective forms of pregnancy prevention, they provide no protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In this paper, I explore whether women on long-term <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraception</b> use condoms less frequently, potentially putting them {{at greater risk of}} contracting STIs. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, I find evidence that women who switch to long-term methods decrease their use of condoms.

2500|$|Emergency {{contraceptive}} pills (ECPs)—sometimes simply {{referred to}} as emergency contraceptives (ECs) or the [...] "morning-after pill"—are medications intended to disrupt or delay ovulation or fertilization, which are necessary for pregnancy.Copper-releasing IUCsWhen used as a regular or emergency <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraception,</b> copper-releasing IUCs act primarily to prevent fertilization. Emergency insertion of a copper IUC is significantly {{more effective than the}} use of ECPs, reducing the risk of pregnancy following unprotected intercourse by more than 99%.2,3 This very high level of effectiveness implies that emergency insertion of a copper IUC must prevent some pregnancies after fertilization.Emergency contraceptive pillsTo make an informed choice, women must know that ECPs—like the birth control pill, patch, ring, shot, and implant,76 and even like breastfeeding77—prevent pregnancy primarily by delaying or inhibiting ovulation and inhibiting fertilization, but may at times inhibit implantation of a fertilized egg in the endometrium. However, women should also be informed that the best available evidence indicates that ECPs prevent pregnancy by mechanisms that do not involve interference with post-fertilization events.ECPs do not cause abortion78 or harm an established pregnancy. Pregnancy begins with implantation according to medical authorities such as the US FDA, the National Institutes of Health79 and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).80Ulipristal acetate (UPA).
