He spoke to her {{about the condition of}} African Americans and the causes of racism. Sanders began to see things from a different perspective. [...] "I really had a lot of pent-up anxiety about my experience in the South," [...] Shabazz recalled in a 1990 interview, [...] "and Malcolm reassured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> understandable how I felt." ...|$|E

500|$|Lucinda Dalton was {{the fourth}} wife of Charles Wakeman Dalton, and {{they were married in}} 1868. Lucinda resented the {{expectation}} that she be meek and obedient in her marriage. Charles assured her that husbands have obligations to their wives as wives do to their husbands. She {{came to the conclusion that}} she should marry Charles because of a spiritual witness they experienced together: [...] "I felt that we were in the presence of the hosts of heaven; and a direct incontrovertible testimony was given <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the will of God and not my will that I should accept this man for my yokefellow." ...|$|E
500|$|In December, {{the couple}} held an {{elaborate}} Christmas party at Brede, attended by Conrad, Henry James, H. G. Wells and other friends; it lasted several days. On December 29 Crane suffered a severe pulmonary hemorrhage. In January 1900 he'd recovered sufficiently {{to work on}} a new novel, The O'Ruddy, completing 25 of the 33chapters. Plans were made for him to travel as a correspondent to Gibraltar to write sketches from Saint Helena, the site of a Boer prison, {{but at the end of}} March and in early April he suffered two more hemorrhages. Taylor took over most of Crane's correspondence while he was ill, writing to friends for monetary aid. The couple planned to travel on the continent, but Conrad, upon visiting Crane for the last time, remarked that his friend's [...] "wasted face was enough to tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the most forlorn of all hopes." ...|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's {{supporting}} role of Dr. Rumack in Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker's 1980's Airplane! {{was a turning}} point in his career. The film, a parody of disaster films such as Zero Hour! and Airport, was based on building a comedy around actors known for dramatic roles. Other stars included Robert Stack, Peter Graves, and Lloyd Bridges. Nielsen's deadpan delivery contrasted with the absurdity surrounding him. When asked, [...] "Surely you can't be serious?", he responded with a curt, [...] "I am serious. And don't call me Shirley." [...] In several interviews he reflected on the line: [...] "I thought it was amusing, but it never occurred to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to become a trademark. It's such a surprise... the thing comes out, people say, 'What did he say?! Nielsen said he was [...] "pleased and honored that [...] had a chance to deliver that line." [...] As of 2010, the comedic exchange was at No.79 on the American Film Institute's AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. The American Film Institute included the film in its list of the top ten comedy films of all time in 2008, and a 2007 survey in the United Kingdom judged it the second greatest comedy film of all time. In 2012 Empire magazine voted it No.1 in The 50 Funniest Comedies Ever poll. Critics praised the film, which also proved a long-term success with audiences. In 2010 Airplane! was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.|$|E

500|$|As {{her story}} {{progresses}} following her constant manipulative behavior, Chloe reveals her true identity: Kate Valentine, {{the daughter of}} the Chancellor maid Esther Valentine (Kate Linder). The storyline was dubbed [...] "Chloe is Kate". Hendrickson was pleased that the writers decided to give Chloe a backstory, saying, [...] "I was so excited when I found out Chloe was going to have some family ties. I knew it would give me, as an actor, a chance to finally explain to viewers why Chloe is the way she is." [...] The actress felt that her family reveal proved that she's not [...] "this bitch who likes to destroy people's lives", attesting her behavior to not being raised by parents; [...] "She never had anyone tell her wrong from right," [...] Hendrickson stated. Her backstory revealed that Chloe hadn't seen her mother or her employer Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) since she [...] "was young and overweight with braces". Kate Linder was also pleased with the writing direction, describing it as an [...] "honor" [...] to work with Hendrickson. She said, [...] "When they decided to bring [...] back, I was stunned and pleasantly surprised. Maria Bell called me and told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> top secret. It was a great reveal." [...] Chloe initially gives Esther the cold shoulder. Of her reasoning behind this, Hendrickson said, [...] "Chloe is very young and immature — as well, hurt and ashamed about her upbringing. She’s not going to let her mother forget it easily." [...] She described their initial relationship as [...] "realistic" [...] and similar to [...] "a lot of mother-and-daughter relationships".|$|E

2500|$|In the {{resulting}} representation, {{also called the}} de Broglie–Bohm theory or Bohmian mechanics, the wave-particle duality vanishes, and explains the wave behaviour as a scattering with wave appearance, because the particle's motion is subject to a guiding equation or quantum potential.

In response, Eric Erlandson stated in Spin magazine that contractually no reunion could take place without his involvement, citing that he and Love [...] "have a contract".

2500|$|Ariel sighted the Bishop Light at 1:30 am on 5 September 1866. With all {{possible}} sail set, she sped toward {{the mouth of}} the English Channel. At daybreak, another ship was seen on the starboard quarter, also carrying every stitch of canvas that she could. Captain Keay of Ariel later said [...] "Instinct told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the Taeping" [...] - and he was right. A strong west-southwesterly wind carried these two ships up the channel at 14 knots. The Lizard was abeam at 8:00 am and Start Point at noon. The two ships were off Portland towards 6:00 pm and St. Catherine's Point was due north at 7:25 pm. Beachy Head was abeam just after midnight. The relative positions of the two ships barely shifted all this while - Ariel kept her lead.|$|E

2500|$|Davis {{was awarded}} a {{scholarship}} to Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, where {{she was one of}} three black students in her freshman class. She initially felt alienated by the isolation of the campus, but she soon made friends with foreign students. She encountered the Frankfurt School philosopher Herbert Marcuse at a rally during the Cuban Missile Crisis and became his student. In a 2007 television interview, she said, [...] "Herbert Marcuse taught <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible to be an academic, an activist, a scholar, and a revolutionary." [...] She worked part-time to earn enough money to travel to France and Switzerland before she attended the eighth World Festival of Youth and Students in Helsinki, Finland.

2500|$|...

Until reading {{the statements}} I had never before known that John's destructive behavior did not stop, but rather increased, in the parish to which he went after leaving my parish. That I could have prevented that from happening had I known to act differently is extremely grievous to me. My efforts to maintain confidentiality and prevent scandal were very misguided." ...|$|E

In it stands the old bed & wardrobe in our former little bedroom at Alt na Guithasach. Upstairs the rooms are equally comfortable. Felt sad & lonely, thinking of the blessed happy past with dearest Albert, who always had wished to build here, in this favourite spot. I could not have lived again at Alt na Guithasach now, alone, & it is far better to have built a totally new house, but the sad thought struck <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the first widow's house, – not blessed by him."

2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} the events following her arrest in Ghazni. American authorities said that two FBI agents, a US Army warrant officer, a US Army captain, and their US military interpreters arrived in Ghazni the following day on 18 July to interview Siddiqui at the Afghan National Police facility where she was being held. They reported they congregated in a meeting room that was partitioned by a curtain, but did not realise that Siddiqui was standing unsecured behind the curtain. The warrant officer sat down and put his loaded M4 carbine {{on the floor by}} his feet near the curtain. Siddiqui drew back the curtain, picked up the rifle, and pointed it at the captain. [...] "I could see the barrel of the rifle, the inner portion of the barrel of the weapon; that indicated to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> pointed straight at my head," [...] he said. Then, she was said to have threatened them loudly in English, and yelled [...] "Get the fuck out of here" [...] and [...] "May the blood of [...] be on your [...] ". The captain dove for cover to his left as she yelled [...] "Allah Akbar" [...] and fired at least two shots at them, missing them. An Afghan interpreter who was seated closest to her tried to disarm her. At that point the warrant officer returned fire with a 9-millimeter pistol, hitting her in the torso, and one of the interpreters disarmed her. A Justice Department statement said that Siddiqui struck and kicked the officers during the ensuing struggle; [...] "she shout in English that she wanted to kill Americans" [...] and then lost consciousness.|$|E
