5|$|Homer-Dixon {{explains}} how his theory {{was influenced by}} endogenous or new growth theory in which ideas are a factor of production independent of labour and capital. He distinguishes his stance from Neo-Malthusianism which seeks to manage systems by controlling demand and from market fundamentalism which believe free <b>markets</b> <b>can</b> provide timely solutions to any problem. Several problems in advancing basic science are identified: human cognitive limits, intrinsic complexity of field, limits of scientific institutions, and social and cultural values regarding science.|$|E

25|$|<b>Markets</b> <b>can</b> {{differ by}} {{products}} (goods, services) or factors (labour and capital) sold, product differentiation, {{place in which}} exchanges are carried, buyers targeted, duration, selling process, government regulation, taxes, subsidies, minimum wages, price ceilings, legality of exchange, liquidity, intensity of speculation, size, concentration, exchange asymmetry, relative prices, volatility and geographic extension. The geographic boundaries of a market may vary considerably, for example the food market in a single building, {{the real estate market}} in a local city, the consumer market in an entire country, or the economy of an international trade bloc where the same rules apply throughout. <b>Markets</b> <b>can</b> also be worldwide, for example the global diamond trade. National economies can be classified, for example as developed markets or developing markets.|$|E

25|$|The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) {{reports that}} the Federal Trade Commission, FBI, and state {{securities}} regulators estimate that investment fraud in the United States ranges from $10–$40 billion annually. Of that number, SIPC estimates that $1–3 Billion is directly attributable to microcap stock fraud. Fraudulent schemes perpetrated in the securities and commodities <b>markets</b> <b>can</b> ultimately have a devastating impact on the viability and operation of these markets.|$|E

25|$|Making Globalization Work {{surveys the}} inequities {{of the global}} economy, and the {{mechanisms}} by which developed countries exert an excessive influence over developing nations. Dr. Stiglitz argues that through tariffs, subsidies, an over-complex patent system and pollution, the world is being both economically and politically destabilised. Stiglitz argues that strong, transparent institutions are needed to address these problems. He shows how an examination of incomplete <b>markets</b> <b>can</b> make corrective government policies desirable.|$|E
25|$|However, {{competitive}} {{markets are}} not without limitations. Basic economic theory dictates that for competition to exist, {{a large number of}} market participants are required. Experience with deregulation in the United States and the United Kingdom, however, has shown that competitive <b>markets</b> <b>can</b> lead to market power concentration and market manipulation. In these jurisdictions, the market has been threatened by the strategic behaviour of incumbents and new entrants that have too large a market share. The case of Enron in California is a prime example. For a competitive market to function, firms cannot significantly influence prices by adjusting or shutting down supply individually.|$|E
25|$|A {{commodity}} {{market is a}} market that trades in primary economic sector rather than manufactured products. Soft commodities are agricultural products such as wheat, coffee, cocoa, fruit and sugar. Hard commodities are mined, such as gold and oil. Investors access about 50 major {{commodity market}}s worldwide with purely financial transactions increasingly outnumbering physical trades in which goods are delivered. Futures contracts are the oldest way of investing in commodities. Futures are secured by physical assets. Commodity <b>markets</b> <b>can</b> include physical trading and derivatives trading using spot prices, forwards, futures, and options on futures. Farmers have used a simple form of derivative trading in the commodity market for centuries for price risk management.|$|E

25|$|None of {{the models}} {{developed}} so far succeed to explain exchange rates and volatility in the longer time frames. For shorter time frames (less than a few days), algorithms can be devised to predict prices. It is understood from the above models that many macroeconomic factors affect the exchange rates {{and in the end}} currency prices are a result of dual forces of demand and supply. The world's currency <b>markets</b> <b>can</b> be viewed as a huge melting pot: in a large and ever-changing mix of current events, supply and demand factors are constantly shifting, and the price of one currency in relation to another shifts accordingly. No other market encompasses (and distills) as much {{of what is going on}} in the world at any given time as foreign exchange.|$|E
25|$|Poaching is {{a threat}} to Oncorhynchus salmon and steelhead populations in Russia. It is {{estimated}} that illegal catching of salmon is 1.5 times more than the reported catch. The Wild Salmon Center is working with Russian authorities to try to help improve traceability systems so that <b>markets</b> <b>can</b> distinguish between legal sustainable salmon and the illegal salmon. The Wild Salmon Center has secured some of its protected locations for the salmon populations. In efforts with the WWF, the Wild Salmon Center was also able to have a Sockeye Salmon fishery certified as completely sustainable in 2012. The Iturup Island Pink and Chum Salmon Fishery was first certified in 2009 and was the first Russian salmon fishery to receive certification in sustainability by MSC. Other fisheries that were certified by MSC include the Northeast Sakhalin Island Pink Salmon, certified in June 2012, and the Ozernaya River Sockeye Salmon, certified in September 2012. The Aniva Bay Pink Salmon and the Sakhalin Island Pink salmon are both under review by the MSC.|$|E

2500|$|The third {{markets are}} {{procurement}} markets. They are needed as media enterprises {{generally do not}} produce all their offered content themselves but buy service packages of both, information and entertainment, from procurement markets. [...] For example, authors and artists contracts or license and copyright deals can be acquired. But procurement <b>markets</b> <b>can</b> turn to business markets if, for example, complete rights to an event are purchased and then resold by a media enterprise {{in the form of}} secondary utilization rights.

5000|$|Marketing mix - Marketing mix is {{a crucial}} factor for any {{business}} to be successful. Especially for a small business, examining a competitor’s <b>marketing</b> mix <b>can</b> be very helpful.

2500|$|Bond <b>markets</b> <b>can</b> {{also differ}} from stock markets in that, in some markets, investors {{sometimes}} {{do not pay}} brokerage commissions to dealers with whom they buy or sell bonds. Rather, the dealers earn revenue {{by means of the}} spread, or difference, between the price at which the dealer buys a bond from one investor—the [...] "bid" [...] price—and the price at which he or she sells the same bond to another investor—the [...] "ask" [...] or [...] "offer" [...] price. The bid/offer spread represents the total transaction cost associated with transferring a bond from one investor to another.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability to}} attract first-time patrons is {{critical}} to a nightclub's success. [...] As such, promotions, advertising, and special offers are the typical means to market a nightclub. [...] Marketing strategies for strip clubs include attracting new customers, increasing the frequency of visits by existing customers, and establishing {{a higher level of}} name recognition. [...] Target <b>markets</b> <b>can</b> include the business-convention traveler, local professionals, and business people. College students are also a secondary target market. Advertising is essential for strip clubs, but local regulations and public reaction can make it challenging. [...] For this reason, clubs around the world advertise on the World Wide Web. [...] Advertising can include discount passes, virtual club tours, and dancer schedules.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{important}} synergies between {{many of these}} services and FSM, and investigating co-management opportunities can yield benefits. [...] MSW can often be co-managed with fecal waste, especially when thermal treatment technologies are used. [...] Food waste from restaurants and <b>markets</b> <b>can</b> be co-composted with fecal waste to produce a high value soils amendment. [...] Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG) from commercial grease traps {{can be added to}} biodigesters to increase methane production, or used in conjunction with fecal sludge as a feedstock for biodiesel production. Water supply is also closely linked with FSM as it is often the water utility that will manage programs and their customers that will pay for services through tariffs.|$|E
