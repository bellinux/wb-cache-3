40|$|Some {{issues in}} the {{evaluation}} of generic promotion have received relatively little attention. The agricultural economics literature on brand versus generic advertising is often simple empirically and has not related well to the burgeoning marketing literature on brand/private label strategies. Conversely, that literature does not often consider the implication of the strategies for any but consumers, processors and retailers. Thus, there is a significant gap in terms of branding strategy implications for farmers, {{in spite of the fact}} that many farm groups and co-operatives feel that this should be their main <b>marketing</b> <b>goal.</b> This issue becomes more relevant for exporting countries such as Australia given the requirement for country-of-origin labelling in the most recent US Farm Bill.

40|$|Market {{segmentation}} presents {{one of the}} {{key concepts}} of the modern marketing. The main goal of market segmentation is focused on creating groups (segments) of customers that have similar characteristics, needs, wishes and/or similar behavior regarding the purchase of concrete product/service.

Depending on the concrete <b>marketing</b> <b>goal,</b> different segmentation schemes and techniques may be applied. This paper presents a predictive market segmentation model based on the application of logistic regression model and CHAID analysis. The logistic regression model was used for the purpose of variables selection (from the initial pool of eleven variables) which are statistically significant for explaining the dependent variable. Selected variables were afterwards included in the CHAID procedure that generated the predictive market segmentation model. The model results are presented on the concrete empirical example in the following form: summary model results, CHAID tree, Gain chart, Index chart, risk and classification tables...|$|E
