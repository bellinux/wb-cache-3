5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and <b>Murder</b> <b>on</b> the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In <b>Murder</b> <b>on</b> the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from <b>Murder</b> <b>on</b> the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Several {{graphical}} improvements {{were made}} to <b>Murder</b> <b>on</b> the Orient Express over And Then There Were None. These were mostly dedicated to character design and animation, which were extremely poorly received features of the first Christie game. The development team introduced animation layers, allowing them to control parts of character models independently. This allowed the developers {{to use the same}} animations whether the character was sitting, standing or lying down, and also gave them more head and upper body control. In And Then There Were None, characters had to rotate their entire bodies to talk to one another, whereas in <b>Murder</b> <b>on</b> the Orient Express, characters can simply turn their heads. The game has no physics features, but screen resolution has been increased, more detailed backgrounds have been made, and characters models contain more polygons.|$|E

5|$|The Adventure Company and Chorion, {{the owners}} of the rights to Christie's works, chose Agatha Christie's novel <b>Murder</b> <b>on</b> the Orient Express, widely {{considered}} the author's magnum opus, {{as the basis for the}} next game in the Agatha Christie series. AWE Productions had little influence in the choice, other than being asked for an opinion.
