This system required a railroad employee stationed at each signal to set the signals according to instructions received by telegraph from dispatchers. English railroads also used a [...] "controlled manual" [...] block system, which was adapted for use in the U.S. by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad in 1882.|$|E

50|$|Bi-directional ABS {{was popular}} on lower density single track lines that {{nevertheless}} needed an upgrade from older train order or <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> <b>systems.</b> Bi-directional ABS {{was placed in}} service with the same passing siding infrastructure that operated under the older plain train order system. Opposing trains would still need to clear the main track based on their superiority or instructions, however, unlike under the older system, trains moving {{in the same direction}} could follow one another based on signal indication. This eliminated the need for some of the more cumbersome flagging procedures to protect the rear of trains working under the timetable and train order system.|$|R
30|$|One of {{the first}} {{analytical}} models was developed by Frank [44] in 1966 by studying the delay levels along a single track corridor considering both directional and bidirectional scenarios. He used one train running between two consecutive sidings (using <b>manual</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>system)</b> and a single average speed for each train to calculate the number of possible trains (theoretical capacity) on the given segment. Petersen [45] expanded Frank’s idea in 1974 by considering two different speeds, independent departure times, equal spacing between sidings, and constant delays between two trains. Higgins et al. [46] developed a model in 1998 for urban rail networks to evaluate the delays of trains by considering different factors such as trains’ schedule, track links, sidings, crossings, and the directional/bidirectional operation patterns throughout the network.|$|R
3000|$|<b>Manual</b> <b>blocking</b> versus {{signaling}} <b>systems</b> <b>Manual</b> <b>blocking</b> {{is absent}} on main passenger corridors in the U.S. today, but relatively common on lower density branch ones, {{including some of}} the lines proposed for passenger corridors. In Europe, most shared-use corridors are equipped with one of the common signaling systems [20].|$|R
50|$|Automatic block {{signaling}} {{was invented}} in America, and first put to use by the Eastern Railroad of Massachusetts in 1871, and was soon adopted by other New England railroads. However, the cost of signals, equipment, and installation was very high in the 19th century, which deterred many railroads from installing it except on highly trafficked lines used by passenger trains. By 1906, the Interstate Commerce Commission reported that of the 194,726.6 miles of railroad in the United States, there were 41,916.3 miles protected by the <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> <b>system,</b> and only 6,826.9 miles of automatic block, on either single or double track. The rest of the nation's trackage was operated by timetable and train order.|$|E
5000|$|Manual block systems work by {{dividing}} up a rail line into predefined [...] "blocks", which are typically demarcated by fixed signs. Authority {{to occupy a}} block is granted by some sort of central controller, usually a dispatcher, who has the sole authority to grant such access. Before the widespread adoption of radio communications on trains, authority to occupy a block, along with other instructions, were communicated to trains much as timetable train orders were with station agents and trackside telephones. Some railroads, notably the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), had a system of manual block signals activated by wayside operators in stations or interlocking towers {{eliminating the need for}} some trains to stop. [...] This <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> <b>system</b> is still on use on the Long Island Rail Road, which had been a subsidiary of the PRR.|$|E
50|$|Aside from {{increased}} capacity and safety {{compared to a}} <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> <b>system,</b> another advantage of the single direction ABS system {{is that it is}} relatively inexpensive to install and operate, each signaling point requiring only one relay for its own track circuit and one additional relay for each block in its control length. Where interlockings are installed, entrance from the reverse direction may be fitted with less expensive dwarf or shunt signals and any non-interlocked points may be fitted in a trailing configuration, which require less safety equipment. Traditional ABS also has no single point of failure and no requirement to transmit state information to a central location and as long as its own track circuit is unoccupied and the inputs from the block or two down the line report the same, and ABS signal will display a clear indication.|$|E
5000|$|Automatic block signaling, or ABS, is a {{railroad}} communications system {{that consists of}} a series of signals that divide a railway line into a series of sections, or [...] "blocks". The system controls the movement of trains between the blocks using automatic signals. ABS operation is designed to allow trains operating in the same direction to follow each other in a safe manner without risk of rear end collision. The introduction of ABS reduced railways' costs and increased their capacity. Older <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> <b>systems</b> required human operators. The automatic operation comes from the system's ability to detect whether blocks are occupied or otherwise obstructed, and to convey that information to approaching trains. The system operates without any outside intervention, unlike more modern traffic control systems that require external control to establish a flow of traffic.|$|R
5000|$|In 1874 Sykes {{approached}} James Staats Forbes with {{a scheme}} to interlock the signals and points of three successive LCDR signal boxes in outer London. This {{proved to be a}} success and resulted in his patented system known as ‘lock and block’. From 1875 the Board of Trade began to commend the new system in its Railway Accident Reports and so it was gradually adopted by other British Railways. In 1882 the system was first installed in the USA where it was known as the ‘controlled <b>manual</b> <b>blocking</b> system.’ The <b>system</b> was also used in Russia and Japan.|$|R
50|$|In North American train {{order system}} was often {{implemented}} {{on top of}} other <b>block</b> <b>systems</b> when those <b>block</b> <b>systems</b> needed to be superseded. For example, where <b>manual</b> or automatic <b>block</b> was implemented, train orders {{would be used to}} authorize movements into occupied blocks, against the current of traffic or where no current of traffic was established.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} the three FL4 {{branches}} {{to see the light}} was the Rome-Frascati railway, opened on 7 July 1858, during the reign of Pius IX. At that time, the Roman terminus was located in Piazza di Porta Maggiore, and Frascati was more rural in nature. Five years later, Roma Termini station was inaugurated, coinciding {{with the opening of the}} line to Velletri (continuing to Caserta and Naples). The line to Albano Laziale was opened in October 1889, on the formation of an earlier tramway from Tiburtina station. All of these lines were later electrified to improve performance. Given the increase in passenger traffic after World War II, they also started to establish themselves as commuter lines; simultaneously, freight traffic shrank drastically to the point where it disappeared. Signalling was managed by a <b>manual</b> electric <b>block</b> <b>system.</b> (IT) On 27 January 1992, an accident at Casabianca on the Velletri line killed 6 people and injured 124. As a result, a Central Operational Manager (DCO) (IT) was based in Ciampino to control the Albano Laziale and Velletri lines, while the line to Frascati was similarly managed as far as Ciampino. With the approach of the Great Jubilee of the year 2000, renovation and upgrading work was begun on the Rome-Velletri line; this work included the transformation of the stops at Pavona and Lanuvio into stations, the creation of the San Gennaro stop, and the renovation of several buildings at the stations. On the Rome-Albano Laziale line, the Villetta stop was restored. In early 2000, the disused track no. 1 at Frascati was closed and disconnected from track no. 2.|$|R

50|$|Interlocked manual blocks: In {{the case}} of a single track, {{interlocking}} is used in <b>manual</b> <b>blocks</b> to avoid an error resulting in a head-on collision.|$|R
50|$|The total {{reliance}} on manual procedures {{to ensure safety}} has occasionally resulted in train wrecks, some with fatalities, due to either miscommunication or oversight {{on the part of}} operating personnel. In 1948 the Interstate Commerce Commission set a nationwide speed limit of 60 mph for trains not protected by some kind of <b>block</b> <b>system</b> (including <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> and track warrants) and in 2012 this was expanded to include all lines considered dark territory. Since 1991 the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) had recommended that railroads be required to install new forms of signaling technology, such as positive train control (PTC), that can stop trains from exceeding their procedural authorities and warn them of improperly lined switches. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 and subsequent amendments requiring installation of PTC technology on parts of the U.S. rail network by December 31, 2018, may eliminate many sections of currently dark territory.|$|R
50|$|Other {{types of}} signals can include Train Order signals, <b>manual</b> <b>block</b> signals or signals {{governing}} special safety appliances such as slide fences, non-interlocked sidings, road crossings, etc. These {{are much less}} common than the three standard types.|$|R
