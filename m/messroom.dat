2500|$|On April 19, {{the company}} began the {{conversion}} of the former German ocean liner [...] into a U.S. Navy transport. The conversion involved the installation of 6,500 bunks, construction of a 1,000-seat <b>messroom</b> with over [...] of mess tables, construction of a 104-person sick bay, installation of new galley fixtures including coal ranges, bake ovens and 40- to 80-gallon kettles, installation of [...] of washbasins, the addition of 109 liferafts and 90 emergency ladders, and the conversion of all firehose connections to Navy standard. In addition, the ship's engines were given a complete overhaul, and eight freshwater tanks and the ship's portside lights were repaired. The original contract called for the work to be completed in two weeks, but by utilizing its [...] "man-a-minute" [...] hiring system developed during the war, the company was able to rapidly expand the workforce allocated to the ship from an initial 350 to almost 2,000, completing the work in only eleven days and earning the company another Navy letter of commendation.|$|E
2500|$|Endymion {{departed}} on 2January 1867 for Beyrout, Syria, taking {{supplies for}} [...] She {{had arrived at}} Alexandria, Egypt by 20January. On 25February, one of her carpenters was court-martialled on board [...] for drunkenness. He was found guilty and dismissed from the ship, being returned to the United Kingdom on board [...] Endymion arrived off the Syrian coast on 19April. She returned to Malta on 29July. On 22August, the Mediterranean Squadron, comprising , , , HMS Endymion, [...] and [...] and {{under the command of}} Lord Clarence Paget, departed from Spezia, Italy. The squadron arrived at Bastia, Corsica from Villafranca Tirenna, Sicily on 9 September. On 9October, [...] was in difficulties off Avenza, Italy in a gale. Arethusa and Endymion were despatched under steam to her aid. During the rescue, one of Endymions guns was dislodged from its mountings and ended up in a <b>messroom.</b> A sailor was washed overboard, but was rescued. Arethusa towed Cruiser to Spezia. On 29October, she departed from Malta for Livorno, Italy to collect a 16-year-old Japanese prince, orders having been received to sail immediately after arrival at Malta, once refuelling and victualling had been performed. This was instead of undergoing repairs. She returned to Malta on 7 November. Endymion departed for Marseilles on 11 November with the prince on board. During the voyage to Marseilles, her engines broke down, causing damage to the engine's air pump, cylinders, pistons and trunk. She was ordered back to Malta for repairs, arriving on 22November. On 27November, her assistant-paymaster was court-martialled on board HMS Hibernia for being absent without leave. He was found guilty, losing a year's seniority and being dismissed from the ship.|$|E

5000|$|... 79250 and 79252 {{were taken}} into {{departmental}} use as staff <b>messrooms,</b> numbered 975013 and 975014. They were scrapped in 1978 and 1982 respectively.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{brought up}} {{the two or three}} {{sketches}} ye were asking for, Mr. Coulstin," [...] he said. [...] "The saloon's full of jabbering Spaniards, and the <b>messroom's</b> over hot." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the midst}} of the meal a {{newcomer}} appeared at the doorway to the <b>messroom.</b> It was Dan Baxter.|$|E
60|$|It was Darry who spoke, {{as he and}} Joe {{were eating}} an early supper that night, {{in one corner of}} the <b>messroom.</b>|$|E

50|$|The crew {{accommodations}} {{were all}} in a midship deck house. Crew quarters, <b>messrooms,</b> galley, hospital and the ship's stores were on the main deck. Officers' quarters, accommodations for eight passengers, a combined dining room/lounge and the pantry are on the cabin deck. The captain's office and stateroom and the chief mate's stateroom were on the bridge deck with the wheel house, chart room, radio room, gyro room, fan room and the emergency generator room. Mechanical ventilation and heating was provided for all living and working spaces.|$|R
50|$|In {{the older}} {{parts of the}} {{dockyard}} several buildings, ranging from storehouses to foundries, were converted for office use; this trend continued in later years. Similarly, the Great Steam Smithery (1852) adjoining the Steam Factory (aka No 2 Ship Shop) underwent conversion in 1993 to provide squash courts, offices, <b>messrooms</b> and a self-service laundry. In the same year, Victory Building, a new neo-Georgian office block, was opened on a prominent site facing the historic No 1 basin (just one of several new office blocks built across the dockyard site in each decade {{of the second half}} of the century); it accommodated staff of he Second Sea Lord, relocated there from London.|$|R
60|$|Much to the cadets' relief, {{they did}} not see Asa Lemm in the <b>messroom.</b> Nor did the {{language}} teacher show himself during the morning session.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later the <b>messroom</b> was empty, the lights turned out, and the {{servants}} wrapped up in their blankets had disposed themselves for sleep in the veranda.|$|E
60|$|All of the {{students}} were soon below, and then the various companies marched into the <b>messroom</b> for their last breakfast at the Hall for some time to come.|$|E
50|$|In October 1969 Maidstone was {{refitted}} and re-commissioned as accommodation for 2,000 {{troops and}} sent to Belfast. In 1969 she arrived under tow at Belfast to serve as barracks for the increased security forces in the area. In 1971, she {{was used as a}} prison ship in Operation Demetrius as a place to hold internees without trial, including Gerry Adams. The holding area itself was at the stern and consisted of two bunkhouses, one up, one down, and two <b>messrooms.</b> Above these were the rooms of the governor and his staff (previously the captain's cabin) and above this was the deck, used twice a day for exercise. The deck was surrounded by 10-foot-high barbed wire. She was moored in Belfast harbour 20 ft from the land, entry to the jetty being guarded by sand-bagged army emplacements. Maidstone was also notable for a successful escape by seven Provisional IRA members on 17January 1972. The men swam close to 300 yd through icy water and evaded army and police only to later hold a press conference.|$|R
6000|$|Of Pisek and the night-skirmish at Pisek, glorious to France, {{think all}} the Gazettes, I should have said nothing, were it not that Marechal Broglio, finding what a narrow miss he had made, {{established}} a night-watch there, or bivouac, for six weeks to come; such as never was before or since: Cavalry and Infantry, in quantity, bivouacking there, in the environs of Pisek, on the grim Bohemian snow or snow-slush, in the depth of winter, nightly for six weeks, without whisper of an enemy at any time; whereby the Marechal did save Pisek (if Pisek was ever again in danger), but froze horse and man {{to the edge of}} destruction or into it; so that the [...] "Bivouac of Pisek" [...] became proverbial in French <b>Messrooms,</b> for a generation coming. [Guerre de Boheme, ii. 23, &c.] And one hears in the mind a clangorous nasal eloquence from antique gesticulative mustachio-figures, witty and indignant,--who are now gone to silence again, and their fruitless bivouacs, and frosty and fiery toils, tumbling pell-mell after them. This of Pisek was but one of the many unwise hysterical things poor Broglio did, in that difficult position; which, indeed, was too difficult for any mortal, and for Broglio beyond the average.|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as the}} {{companies}} were formed they were marched around the Hall and to the <b>messroom.</b> Here they were kept standing in a long fine while George Strong came to the front with half a dozen new pupils.|$|E
60|$|Thus admonished, Harry sprang up, plunged {{his hands}} and face in the basin and dried them, broke Charley's comb in {{attempting}} to pass it hastily through his hair, used his fingers savagely as a substitute, and overtook his companions just {{as they entered the}} <b>messroom.</b>|$|E
60|$|As Ralph {{entered the}} <b>messroom</b> the {{officers}} {{had just taken}} their seats. He was greeted with a boisterous outburst of welcome. His comrades got up and shook his hand warmly, {{and he had to}} answer many inquiries as to how O'Connor and Desmond were going on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Brooke is {{commander}} in chief, I am commissary general, the other fellows are staff officers, and you, ladies, are company. The tent {{is for your}} especial benefit and that oak is your drawing room, this is the <b>messroom</b> {{and the third is}} the camp kitchen. Now, let's have a game before it gets hot, and then we'll see about dinner." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{little later}} came the evening parade of the cadets, who marched around the parade ground {{several times before}} {{entering}} the <b>messroom,</b> as the dining hall was termed. The late arrivals did not join in the parade, but they watched it with interest, and then hurried to their accustomed places at the long tables, where a plain, but substantial supper awaited them.|$|E
60|$|Some {{seven or}} eight {{officers}} were sitting round {{the table in the}} <b>messroom</b> of the 103d Bengal Infantry at Cawnpore. It had been a guest night, but the strangers had left, the lights had been turned out in the billiard room overhead, the whist party had broken up, and the players had rejoined three officers who had remained at table smoking and talking quietly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it will be}} horribly dull, Mrs. Doolan. Richards and I have {{quarters}} together here, and, of course, it will be {{the same}} there, and I am sure I don't know what we shall find to talk about when we come to have to mess together. Of course, here, there are the <b>messroom</b> and the club, and so we get on very well, but to be together always will be awful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boom! boom! boom, boom, boom!" [...] {{went the}} drums, {{and then the}} fifers struck up a lively tune, and around the academy marched the two {{companies}} at company front. Then they went around again by column of fours, and then marched into the <b>messroom,</b> where they stacked arms {{and sat down at}} the long mess tables. The movements were patterned after those at West Point, and could not have been improved upon.|$|E
6000|$|The {{dining hall}} at Brill {{was a more}} {{elaborate}} affair than the <b>messroom</b> at Putnam Hall, but the Rovers were used to dining out in fine places, so they felt perfectly at home. Dick and Sam had already met the instructor who had charge of their table, Mr. Timothy Blackie, and they introduced Tom. Stanley and Max were {{at the same table}} and also a long-haired youth named Will Jackson, although his friends called him [...] "Spud." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hurrah! The fort!" [...] cried Joe, as {{he caught}} sight of a large flag waving in the distance. He was right; and soon they could see the tall stockade quite plainly. It was three hundred feet long by two hundred feet wide, and {{surrounded}} by a ditch twelve feet deep. Inside of the stockade were the fort proper and a dozen other buildings, including the officers' quarters, the men's quarters, the <b>messroom,</b> hospital, and the gymnasium, and also a good-sized stable.|$|E
60|$|O Clarissas of this life, O {{you poor}} little ignorant vain foolish maidens! {{if you did}} but know {{the way in which}} the Lovelaces speak of you: if you could but hear Jack talking to Tom across the coffee-room of a Club; or see Ned taking your poor little letters out of his cigar-case, and handing them over to Charley, and Billy, and Harry across the <b>messroom</b> table, you would not be so eager to write, or so ready to listen! There's a sort of crime which is not {{complete}} unless the lucky rogue boasts of it afterwards; and the man who betrays your honour in the first place, is pretty sure, remember that, to betray your secret too.|$|E
60|$|The news of {{what was}} {{imminent}} came slowly to Bert's perceptions. He {{was standing in the}} <b>messroom</b> at the time and the evening rations were being served out. He had resumed Butteridge's coat and gloves, and in addition he had wrapped his blanket about him. He was dipping his bread into his soup and was biting off big mouthfuls. His legs were wide apart, and he leant against the partition in order to steady himself amidst the pitching and oscillation of the airship. The men about him looked tired and depressed; a few talked, but most were sullen and thoughtful, and one or two were air-sick. They all seemed to share the peculiarly outcast feeling that had followed the murders of the evening, a sense of a land beneath them, and an outraged humanity grown more hostile than the Sea.|$|E
60|$|On {{arriving}} at the cantonments, the party were soon surrounded by the troops, who had been called under arms {{at the sound of}} distant firing, but had been dismissed again on the arrival of a message to the effect that the enemy had fled. The news had spread rapidly that some fugitives had escaped from Sandynugghur, where it was supposed that the massacre had been general; and officers pressed forward to shake their hands, and the men uttered words of kindly congratulation and welcome. The greeting swelled into a cheer as the detachment fell out, and, scattering among their comrades, told of the desperate defense, and of the slaughter inflicted upon the enemy by this handful of men. The fugitives were, of course, taken first to the <b>messroom,</b> Captain Dunlop being, however, carried off by the surgeon to his quarters, to have his wound examined and attended to.|$|E
60|$|From the {{servants}} {{of the officers}} at the barracks Mr. Morgan found that the Captain had so frequently and outrageously inebriated himself there, that Colonel Swallowtail had forbidden him the <b>messroom.</b> The indefatigable Morgan then put himself in communication {{with some of the}} inferior actors at the theatre, and pumped them over their cigars and punch, and all agreed that Costigan was poor, shabby, and given to debt and to drink. But there was not a breath upon the reputation of Miss Fotheringay: her father's courage was reported to have displayed itself {{on more than one occasion}} towards persons disposed to treat his daughter with freedom. She never came to the theatre but with her father: in his most inebriated moments, that gentleman kept a watch over her; finally Mr. Morgan, from his own experience added that he had been to see her act, and was uncommon delighted with the performance, besides thinking her a most splendid woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course {{now it is}} different. I feel {{as young}} and as well as I did twenty years ago, and can {{thoroughly}} enjoy my life in London, though I still fight very shy of the country. It is a satisfaction to {{me to know that}} things are pretty quiet in India at present, so that I am losing nothing that way, and if I were out there I should be only holding inspections at Barrakpoor, Dumdum, or on the Maidan at Calcutta. Of course it was pleasant enough in its way, for I never felt the heat; but as a man gets on in life he doesn't have quite so much enjoyment out of it as he used to do. The men around him are a good deal younger than himself. He knows all the old <b>messroom</b> jokes, and one bit of scandal is like scores of others he has heard in his time.|$|E
60|$|This is the 'Affair of Nanci;' by some {{called the}} 'Massacre of Nanci;'--properly speaking, the {{unsightly}} wrong-side of that thrice glorious Feast of Pikes, the right-side of which formed a spectacle {{for the very}} gods. Right-side and wrong lie always so near: the one was in July, in August the other! Theatres, the theatres over in London, are bright with their pasteboard simulacrum of that 'Federation of the French People,' brought out as Drama: this of Nanci, we may say, though not played in any pasteboard Theatre, did for many months enact itself, and even walk spectrally--in all French heads. For the news of it fly pealing through all France; awakening, in town and village, in clubroom, <b>messroom,</b> to the utmost borders, some mimic reflex or imaginative repetition of the business; always with the angry questionable assertion: It was right; It was wrong. Whereby come controversies, duels, embitterment, vain jargon; the hastening forward, the augmenting and intensifying of whatever new explosions lie in store for us.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{were not}} many who {{believed}} in a mutiny that night. The villains, only in the morning, having sworn to be faithful, deceived most of us, for {{it was very hard}} to believe they could be capable of such diabolical treachery. Swords and pistols were, of course, taken off, but instead of being left in the anteroom, were brought into the <b>messroom.</b> Some fellows put theirs in a corner, others against the wall behind them. I was sitting between Dunlop and Manners, and we were, as it happened, at the corner nearest the window fixed upon for the bolt. Things went on all right till dinner was over, There was an insolent look about some of the servants' faces I did not like, but nothing to take hold of. I pointed it out to Dunlop, and we agreed that the plan arranged was the best possible; and that, as resistance would be of no use, if at each of the eight large windows and the two doors a stream of musketry fire were being poured in, we would make a rush straight for the window. Presently the colonel rose and gave 'The Queen.' We all rose, and as if--as I have no doubt it was-- the toast was the signal, there was a sudden trampling in the veranda outside, and at every window appeared a crowd of Sepoys, with their arms in their hands. I shouted, 'To the window for your lives!' and without stopping to get my sword, I dashed at the Sepoys who were there. Dunlop and Manners were with me, and before the scoundrels had time to get their guns to their shoulders, we were upon them. We are all big men; and our weight and impetus, and the surprise, were too much for them; we burst through them, standing as they did four or five deep, as if they had been reeds. They gave a yell of rage and astonishment as they went down like ninepins; but we scarcely saw it, for as we went through them the musketry fire broke out round the <b>messroom.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{have not}} had so much variety as you, but we have gone through a good deal. You know we had talked over the best {{possible}} course to take in case of an attack, come when it might. We had arranged what each should do in case of a night attack, or of a rising upon parade; and we had even considered the probability of being set upon when gathered in the <b>messroom.</b> We had all agreed that if taken by surprise, resistance would mean certain death; they would shoot us down through the doors and windows, and we should be like rats in a cage. We agreed, therefore, that in case of an attack, a simultaneous attempt to break out must be made, and we had even settled upon the window by which we should go. The married men were, of course, to make for their bungalows, except where, as in my case, I had made other arrangements; and the rest to various bungalows agreed upon, where traps were to be in readiness. Dunlop, Manners, and myself had agreed to make for Dunlop's, as it was the nearest, and his trap was to be ready that evening.|$|E
6000|$|And even {{so it will}} blaze and run, {{scorching}} all things; and, from Cadiz to Archangel, mad Sansculottism, drilled {{now into}} Soldiership, led on by some 'armed Soldier of Democracy' (say, that Monosyllabic Artillery-Officer), will set its foot cruelly on the necks of its enemies; and its shouting and their shrieking shall fill the world!--Rash Coalised Kings, such a fire have ye kindled; yourselves fireless, your fighters animated only by drill-serjeants, <b>messroom</b> moralities, and the drummer's cat! However, it is begun, and will not end: not for a matter of twenty years. So long, this Gaelic fire, through its successive changes of colour and character, will blaze over the face of Europe, and afflict the scorch all men:--till it provoke all men; till it kindle another kind of fire, the Teutonic kind, namely; and be swallowed up, so to speak, in a day! For there is a fire comparable to the burning of dry-jungle and grass; most sudden, high-blazing: and another fire which we liken to the burning of coal, or even of anthracite coal; difficult to kindle, but then which nothing will put out. The ready Gaelic fire, we can remark further, and remark not in Pichegrus only, but in innumerable Voltaires, Racines, Laplaces, no less; for a man, whether he fight, or sing, or think, will remain the same unity of a man,--is admirable for roasting eggs, in every conceivable sense. The Teutonic anthracite again, as we see in Luthers, Leibnitzes, Shakespeares, is preferable for smelting metals. How happy is our Europe that has both kinds!-- ...|$|E
