30|$|We {{consider}} a single ST 1, N number of ST 2 s served by N beams of SAT 2. Multibeam joint processing is considered at the gateway of SAT 2 to decode the received signals from ST 2 s jointly. Since a single gateway {{is responsible for}} processing the transmitted and received signals corresponding to a large geographic area, the application of joint processing techniques in the satellite context is centralized. After scheduling, we consider that one ST 1 and N number of ST 2 s are transmitting simultaneously in a single slot over a common spectrum band. In this context, we consider spatial multiplexing for the primary <b>monobeam</b> <b>system</b> and we employ multiple dimensions (carriers) in the secondary multibeam system to align interference with the reference vector.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the limited}} and {{expensive}} spectrum resource, cognitive radio communication can be an efficient technique to enhance the spectrum efficiency {{in the context of}} coexistence of heterogeneous networks. Heterogeneous networks may exist within the same spectrum band in different ways such as two terrestrial networks or two satellite networks. In the terrestrial paradigm, the coexistence of small cells and macrocells can be considered within the same spectrum while in the satellite paradigm {{the focus is on the}} coexistence of monobeam and multibeam satellite systems. Heterogeneous networks in this article refer to small/macro cell terrestrial and mono/multibeam satellite systems. In the context of terrestrial paradigm, the macrocell system can be considered as primary and a small cell system as secondary system. Similarly, in the context of dual satellite coexistence scenarios, a <b>monobeam</b> <b>system</b> can be considered as primary and a multibeam system as secondary. In both scenarios, the interference from the secondary system to the primary system should be suppressed while the secondary system must tolerate the interference from the primary system.|$|E
30|$|In this scenario, we {{consider}} a spectral coexistence network of multibeam and <b>monobeam</b> satellite <b>systems</b> with interference channels between them. Each transmitter/receiver node {{consists of a}} single antenna and uses multicarrier transmission so that the channels can be represented as diagonal matrices, where the diagonal entries correspond to the different sub-channels. The multicarrier model considered in this scenario differs from MIMO (spatial) channel matrix with full entries as considered in the terrestrial scenario.|$|R
5000|$|Inventing and {{promoting}} the Project 21 <b>monobeam,</b> later <b>System</b> 21, the world's only aerial rail system suitable for networks above city streets. Whereas a classical monorail requires {{a pair of}} beams for two-way traffic and its switching limitations hinder its ability to run on networks, the monobeam carries opposite trains alongside a single slender beam; its footprint is smaller, and its breakthrough switching technology enables it to form networks.System 21 was praised by two Secretaries of Transportation and Vice President Al Gore {{as well as the}} Regional Plan Association in two federally supported books. In March 1989, the Federal Register noted, [...] "This project has high technical merit representing an innovative technology which has a strong possibility of allowing for future reductions in the nation's energy consumption." ...|$|R
