She argues that the {{rejection}} of certain principles, such as deception and coercion, provides {{a starting point for}} basic conceptions of justice, which she argues are more determinate for human beings that the more abstract principles of equality or liberty. Nevertheless, she concedes that these principles <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> excessively demanding: there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non-universalisable principles, such as injury.|$|E

5|$|Though Dhumavati <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a goddess}} {{to be avoided}} due to her inauspiciousness, she is {{described}} as tender-hearted and one who gives her devotees whatever they want. In several places, Dhumavati {{is described as a}} giver of siddhis (supernatural powers), a rescuer from all troubles and granter of all desires and rewards, including ultimate knowledge and moksha (salvation). Dhumavati's worship is prescribed to ward off all the negativity that she stands for and to transcend the smoke screen to acquire true knowledge. By worshipping and confronting her, the embodiment of the impure, the inauspicious and outside the fringes of society, one can look beyond the arbitrary dichotomies of society and acquire ultimate knowledge to become spiritually enlightened.|$|E

25|$|While lucrative, the {{revenues}} realized {{from the three}} factories should not be overemphasized: while the Medici often had invested more than 7,900 gold florins in the three factories in 1458, for example, the sum invested in banks in 1458 was more than 28,800and that figure is low, for it excludes the Rome branch serving the Pope, the Medici's interest-bearing deposits in their branches, and also omits any accounting of several years' profit which were inaccessible (since the relevant partnerships {{had not yet been}} dissolved; this <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a flaw in the system, but it built up capital in a branch and allowed it to lend out more than it had been incorporated with). Part of the reason for maintaining these factories when the funds could have been more profitably invested in the banks or trade could have been social: it seems to have a bit of a Florentine tradition to run such factories to provide employment for the poora social obligation, as it were.|$|E

25|$|Nancy Mitford {{writes in}} the first essay that the English {{aristocracy}} is the only real aristocracy {{left in the world}} today, even if it <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the verge of decadence: it has political power through the House of Lords and real social position through the Queen. Then she explains the order of precedence of dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, barons, members of a noble family, young sons, baronets, knights and knights of the Garter. Accused of being a snob, she quotes from Professor Alan Ross of Birmingham University who points out that “it is solely by their language that the upper classes nowadays are distinguished since they are neither cleaner, richer, nor better-educated than anybody else". Miss Mitford says Professor Ross invented the U and non-U English useful formula. Though she doesn't agree completely with the Professor's list, she adopts his classification system, and adds a few suggestions of her own. She gives many examples of U and non-U usage and thoroughly explains the aristocracy saying, for example, dukes are rather new creations, the purpose of the aristocrat is most emphatically not to work for money, and nobility in England is based on title and not on bloodline. The ancestors of the lords spent months abroad, buying pictures and statues, which they cheerfully sell in order to spend months abroad, she writes.|$|E

Paramount among these {{is the question of}} solitude versus loneliness, as embodied by Bemis' moment of near-suicide. Additionally, the portrayal of societal attitudes towards books speaks to the contemporary decline of traditional literature and how, given enough time, reading may become a relic of the past. At the same time, the ending [...] "punishes Bemis for his antisocial behavior, and his greatest desire is thwarted".|$|E

Epistle 48 tells how the friends return to Stockholm by boat after a night out on Lake Mälaren, one summer morning in 1769. Each of its twenty-one verses paints a picture of a moment in the peaceful journey, from the wind stirring the fallen sails, the skipper's daughter coming out of her cabin, the cockerel crowing, the church clock striking four in the morning, the sun glimmering on the calm water. The effects <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> haphazard, but [...] "each stanza is a little picture, framed by its melody. We remember it all, seem to have lived through it, like a morning in our own lives." [...] Britten Austin calls it [...] "a new vision of the natural and urban scene. Fresh as Martin's.

500|$|Zvi Hecker {{architecture}} {{has continued}} to emphasize geometry and modularity, but with increasing asymmetry. Ramot Polin (1972–75) is a rare prefabricated apartment complex with 720 non-rectangular components. The apartments were expanded later, incorporating more cubic rather than pentagonal components. The design idea of this neighborhood <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the more purely geometrical, however it is likened to a chemical structure, and in plan view to an open hand, and a leaf- therefore imparting it with metaphorical qualities. More examples of advanced geometry in Hecker's work are the Spiral Apartment House in Ramat Gan, (1981–1989), and the Heinz-Galinski-Schule (1992–1995) in Berlin, noted for their high degree of complexity. The Heinz-Galinski-Schule won Zvi Hecker the Deutscher Kritikerpreis in 1995- it was stated that {{the decision of the}} jury was based on their appreciation of the [...] "expressive geometry of his construction." [...] The Spiral Apartment House is located adjacent to his earlier Dubiner house, providing a juxtaposition of two important moments in his career. The work of Zvi Hecker has been compared to that of Antonio Gaudi, for expressiveness and expanding of architectural ideas.|$|E

Love and Other Drugs." [...] Sandie Angulo Chen of Common Sense Media wrote that the characters' [...] "relationship is built on mutual respect and trust, something completely missing in many earlier Disney movies." [...] The Miami Heralds Rene Rodriquez opined, [...] "Even though they <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> boilerplate fairy-tale heroes, you genuinely come to care about Rapunzel and Flynn and root for them to be together," [...] while Joe Neumaier of the Daily News simply called their relationship [...] "cute". Ted Fry of The Seattle Times wrote, [...] "The back-and-forth banter of what inevitably becomes a courtship is consistently witty and given extra sparkle from adroit characterizations by Moore and Levi." [...] Similarly, Cathy Jakicic, writing for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, opined, [...] "Moore and Levi, meanwhile, breathe new life into the classic love-hate romance." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune felt that both [...] "characters are equally strong and funny". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that the characters' relationship makes the film [...] "engaging".

500|$|Tøjner {{describes}} {{the work as}} [...] "Lichtenstein's finest formulation of a counter-image to the many explosions in his universe", noting that the drama is past its peak although it <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at a crescendo. He also notes that [...] "the tears are drawn with classic Lichtenstein waxy fullness" [...] despite the surrounding water, which must be significant since [...] "naturalistic justification" [...] is absent. A November 1963 Art Magazine review stated that {{this was one of}} the [...] "broad and powerful paintings" [...] of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery. Nonetheless, the name of the work was not universally known. [...] In a December 1964 Art Magazine review of his October 24– September 19, 1964 Castelli Gallery show, Lichtenstein was referred to as the author of I Don't Care, I'd Rather Sink (Drowning Girl). According to Gary Garrels of the Museum of Modern Art, the work is a [...] "poetics of the utterly banal, of displaced ordinariness" [...] resulting in an [...] "image frozen in time and space", making it [...] "iconic". Comparing this to the source, Garrels says it is a rendering [...] "in a simplified vocabulary" [...] produced while Lichtenstein put aside his mechanical objectivity. According to The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, extreme examples of his formalization become [...] "virtual abstraction" [...] when the viewer recalls that the motif is an element of a larger work. Thus, Lichtenstein reinforced a non-realist view of comic strips and advertisements, presenting them as artificial images with minimalistic graphic techniques. Lichtenstein's magnification of his source material stressed the plainness of his motifs as an equivalent to mechanical commercial drawing, leading to implications about his statements on modern industrial America. Nonetheless, Lichtenstein appears to have accepted the American capitalist industrial culture.|$|E
