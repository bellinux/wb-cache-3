40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the magnetohydrodynamic (<b>MHD)</b> <b>conversion</b> {{of the energy}} released during the planetary entry phase of an interplanetary vehicle trajectory. The effect of <b>MHD</b> <b>conversion</b> is multi-fold. It reduces and redirects heat transferred to the vehicle, and regenerates the dissipated energy in reusable and transportable form. A vehicle on an interplanetary mission carries about 10, 000 kWh of kinetic energy per ton of its mass. This energy is dissipated into heat during the planetary atmospheric entry phase. For instance, the kinetic energy of Mars Pathfinder was about 4220 kWh. Based on the loss in velocity, Mars Pathfinder lost about 92. 5 % of that energy during the plasma-sustaining entry phase that is approximately 3900 kWh. An ideal MHD generator, distributed over the probe surface of Mars Pathfinder could convert more than 2000 kWh of this energy loss into electrical energy, which correspond to more than 50 % of the kinetic energy loss. That means that the heat transferred to the probe surface can be reduced by at least 50 % if the converted energy is adequately stored, or re-radiated, or directly used. Therefore, <b>MHD</b> <b>conversion</b> could act not only as the power generating, but also as the cooling process. In this paper we describe results of preliminary experiments with light and microwave emitters powered by model magnetohydrodynamic generators and discuss method for direct use of converted energy...|$|E

40|$|The {{suitability}} of eleven types of nuclear fission reactors {{in combination with}} five potential energy conversion systems for use in geosynchronous power plants is evaluated. Gas turbine, potassium Rankine liquid metal MHD, and thermionic energy conversion systems are considered. The existing technology of reactors in near-term, intermediate-term, and long-term classes is discussed, together with modifications for use in large-scale power production in space. Unless the temperature is high enough for MHD, reactors which heat gases are generally more suitable for use with gas turbines. Those which heat liquid metals will be more useful for potassium Rankine or liquid metal <b>MHD</b> <b>conversion</b> systems...|$|E
50|$|Conversion bulbs are {{manufactured}} so {{they work with}} either a MH or HPS ballast. A grower can run an HPS conversion bulb on a MH ballast, or a <b>MH</b> <b>conversion</b> bulb on a HPS ballast. The difference between the ballasts is an HPS ballast has an igniter which ignites the sodium in an HPS bulb, while a MH ballast does not. Because of this, all electrical ballasts can fire MH bulbs, but only a Switchable or HPS ballast can fire an HPS bulb without a conversion bulb. Usually a metal halide conversion bulb {{will be used in}} an HPS ballast since the <b>MH</b> <b>conversion</b> bulbs are more common.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{report the}} {{detection}} with the IRAM interferometer at 3 mm of J= 5 - 4 CO {{line in the}} radio quiet quasar BRI 1335 - 0415 at redshift of z = 4. 41. After BR 1202 - 0725 at z = 4. 69 (Ohta et al. 1996, Omont et al. 1996 a), {{this is the second}} detection of CO at z> 3. The integrated line intensity is 2. 8 ± 0. 3 Jykms − 1 with a linewidth of 420 ± 60 km s − 1. The dust continuum emission has also been mapped at 1. 35 mm. The 1. 35 mm flux is found to be 5. 6 ± 1. 1 mJy. The ratio of the CO to 1. 35 mm continuum flux is slightly larger than for BR 1202 - 0725. Contrary to the case of BR 1202 - 0725, there is only marginal evidence of extension of the 1. 35 mm continuum and 3 mm CO emission. In the absence of gravitational lensing, {{for which there is no}} a priori evidence, and within the uncertainties of the CO to <b>M(H</b> 2) <b>conversion</b> factors, the mass of molecular gas M(H 2) could be 10 11 M⊙.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{mechanisms}} have been proposed to supply the energy for gamma-ray bursts (GRB) at cosmological distances. It is a common misconception that some of these, notably NS-NS mergers, cannot meet the energy requirements suggested by recent observations. We show here that GRB energies, even at the most distant redshifts detected, are compatible with current binary merger or collapse scenarios involving compact objects. This is especially so if, as expected, there is a moderate amount of beaming, since current observations constrain the energy per solid angle much more strongly and directly than the total energy. All plausible progenitors, ranging from NS-NS mergers to various hypernova-like scenarios, eventually lead {{to the formation of}} a black hole with a debris torus around it, so that the extractable energy is of the same order, 1 E+ 54 ergs, in all cases. <b>MHD</b> <b>conversion</b> of gravitational into kinetic and radiation energy can significantly increase the probability of observing large photon fluxes, although significant collimation may achieve the same effect with neutrino annihilation in short bursts. The lifetime of the debris torus is dictated by a variety of physical processes, such as viscous accretion and various instabilities; these mechanisms dominate at different stages {{in the evolution of the}} torus and provide for a range of gamma-ray burst lifetimes.
