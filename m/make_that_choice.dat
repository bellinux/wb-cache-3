But as a nation, we recognize the right of all people to believe as they want and not to impose our beliefs on other people. I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country. I have since the time that my mom took that position when she ran in 1970 as a U.S. Senate candidate. I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, that we should sustain and support it, and I sustain and support that law, and the right of a woman to <b>make</b> <b>that</b> <b>choice,</b> and my personal beliefs, like the personal beliefs of other people, should not be brought into a political campaign." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 1987, the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit {{upheld the}} Witnesses' right to shun those {{who fail to}} live by the group's {{standards}} and doctrines, upholding the ruling of a lower court. The court concluded that, [...] "Shunning is a practice engaged in by Jehovah's Witnesses pursuant to their interpretation of canonical text, {{and we are not}} free to reinterpret that text. ... We find the practice of shunning not to constitute a sufficient threat to the peace, safety, or morality of the community as to warrant state intervention. ... the defendants are entitled to the free exercise of their religious beliefs. ... Courts generally do not scrutinize closely the relationship among members (or former members) of a church. Churches are afforded great latitude when they impose discipline on members or former members. ... The members of the Church Paul decided to abandon have concluded that they no longer want to associate with her. We hold that they are free to <b>make</b> <b>that</b> <b>choice.</b> ... Although we recognize that the harms suffered by Janice Paul are real and not insubstantial, permitting her to recover for intangible or emotional injuries would unconstitutionally restrict the Jehovah's Witnesses free exercise of religion. ... The constitutional guarantee of the free exercise of religion requires that society tolerate the type of harms suffered by Paul as a price well worth paying to safeguard the right of religious difference that all citizens enjoy." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{it is of}} no use to grumble {{about this}} state of things unless one is {{prepared}} to indicate some sort of practical remedy. And I believe--and I venture to make the statement because I am wholly independent {{of all sorts of}} medical schools, and may, therefore, say what I believe without being supposed to be affected by any personal interest--but I say I believe that the remedy for this state of things, for that imperfection of our theoretical knowledge which keeps down the ability of England at the present time in medical matters, is a mere affair of mechanical arrangement; that so long as you have a dozen medical schools scattered about {{in different parts of the}} metropolis, and dividing the students among them, so long, in all the smaller schools at any rate, it is impossible that any other state of things than that which I have been depicting should obtain. Professors must live; to live they must occupy themselves with practice, and if they occupy themselves with practice, the pursuit of the abstract branches of science must go to the wall. All this is a plain and obvious matter of common-sense reasoning. I believe you will never alter this state of things until, either by consent or by force majeure--and I should be very sorry to see the latter applied--but until there is some new arrangement, and until all the theoretical branches of the profession, the institutes of medicine, are taught in London in not more than one or two, or at the outside three, central institutions, no good will be effected. If that large body of men, the medical students of London, were obliged in the first place to get a knowledge of the theoretical branches of their profession in two or three central schools, there would be abundant means for maintaining able professors--not, indeed, for enriching them, as they would be able to enrich themselves by practice--but for enabling them to <b>make</b> <b>that</b> <b>choice</b> which such men are so willing to make; namely, the choice between wealth and a modest competency, when that modest competency is to be combined with a scientific career, and the means of advancing knowledge. I do not believe that all the talking about, and tinkering of, medical education will do the slightest good until the fact is clearly recognised, that men must be thoroughly grounded in the theoretical branches of their profession, and that to this end the teaching of those theoretical branches must be confined to two or three centres.|$|E

Asking customers their willingness to pay will not work - everyone will claim to have low willingness to pay. But the park can offer a menu of priority and regular tickets, where priority allows skipping the line at rides and is more expensive. This will induce the customers with a higher value of time to buy the priority ticket and thereby reveal their type.|$|R

To the patients, however, radiological services may seem somewhat inconvenient, mysterious or frightening, or may even be a painful intrusion of their privacy. The perception is further altered by the fact that patients typically do not choose their radiologist; the referring physician, the health plan or another intermediary usually <b>makes</b> <b>that</b> <b>choice.</b> Often patients and their diagnostic radiologist never meet. This situation substantially alters the service bond between them, actually making the relationship more demanding {{in a number of ways}} [10]. Moreover, nurses, technologists and others are increasingly participating in the performance of imaging examinations. For many patients, radiologists are identified only with the equipment used and not as physicians who play a vital role in the decisions that affect them. The use of technologists, nurses, and physician assistants for intravenous injection of contrast material makes radiologist-patient contact even less common [2] [...]...|$|R
