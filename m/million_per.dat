5|$|During {{the casino}} {{shutdown}}, 36,000 casino workers were given leave. The shutdown of casinos resulted in lost {{revenue for the}} state, as an estimated $1.3 <b>million</b> <b>per</b> day was collected in gambling taxes plus an additional $2 <b>million</b> <b>per</b> day due to {{the closure of the}} lottery system.

Atlantic City's 12 casinos suffered losses estimated at $16–20 <b>million</b> <b>per</b> day during the shutdown. Revenue losses to lottery vendors and casino employees have not been calculated. Legislation signed by Governor Corzine in June 2008 would keep casinos and racetracks open in the event of a future budget showdown, with the Governor noting that the casino industry is vital to the New Jersey economy and that it should not operate under the threat of closure as it did in 2006.|$|E
