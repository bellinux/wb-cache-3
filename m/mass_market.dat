Gregory Clark noted that the Japanese edition of Ways That Are Dark, which was entitled Ankoku Tairiku Chūgoku no Shinjitsu ("The Truth About the Dark Continent China"), had garnered widespread popularity among members of the Japanese right-wing.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Mass</b> <b>marketing</b> is used {{to effect}} {{attitude}} change to as wide an audience as possible. Often this would {{take the form of}} selling a product like toothpaste. Toothpaste isn't made specially for one consumer and it is sold in huge quantities. A company or individual who manufactures toothpaste wishes to get more people to buy their particular brand over another. The goal is when a consumer has the option to select a tube of toothpaste that the consumer would remember the product which was <b>marketed.</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>marketing</b> is the opposite of niche marketing, where a product is made specially for one person or a group of persons. Other products of <b>mass</b> <b>marketing</b> are furniture, artwork, automobiles, residential communities, fizzy drinks and personal computers. Typically, things which are perceived to be necessary/essential to the consumer are subject to <b>mass</b> <b>marketing.</b> Resources of <b>mass</b> <b>marketing</b> provide cost-effective marketing solutions for small and micro businesses, including start-ups. Even [...] "products" [...] like politicians and services from professions such as law, chiropractic and medicine, are subject to <b>mass</b> <b>marketing.</b>|$|R

5|$|From {{the moment}} Thriller was released, it set the {{standard}} for the music industry: artists, record labels, producers, marketers and even choreographers. The music video was ahead of its time and it is considered a monumental one—not only in Jackson's career, but also in the history of pop music. Epic Records' approach to creating a song and video that would appeal to the <b>mass</b> <b>market</b> ended up influencing the way that professionals now market and release their songs. John Landis's production of a mini-movie, rather than the usual short music video, would raise the bar for other directors and producers.|$|E

It is effective at relieving pain associated with back aches, and is registered with the Food and Drug Administration as a physical medicine device under the classification therapeutic electric massager. The stated use of the Magic Wand is the soothing and relaxing of sore muscles and nerves, relieving tension, and rehabilitation after sports injuries.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's {{distribution}} {{arrangements were}} {{an essential part}} of its success and marked a watershed in the way that computers were sold in the UK. Sinclair had previously made its name as a mail-order retailer – the ZX81 was initially available only through mail-order – but the only truly effective way to reach the <b>mass</b> <b>market</b> was via high street stores. Fortunately for Sinclair, an opportunity to do just that was provided by W.H. Smith, a venerable book- and magazine-seller and stationery chain. The company had stagnated in the 1970s and was looking for ways to revitalise its image and expand its product range.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} the First World War {{dramatically}} shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a <b>mass</b> <b>market</b> in the post-war era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed {{in the air as}} much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.|$|E
5|$|The {{system was}} {{the topic of}} intense inter-service rivalry {{throughout}} its lifetime. When the ABM role {{was given to the}} Army in 1958, the United States Air Force began a long series of critiques on Zeus, both within defense circles and in the press. The Army returned these attacks in kind, taking out full page advertisements in popular <b>mass</b> <b>market</b> news magazines to promote Zeus, as well as spreading development contracts across many states in order to garner the maximum political support. As deployment neared in the early 1960s, the debate became a major political issue. The question ultimately became whether or not a system with limited effectiveness would be better than nothing at all.|$|E

5|$|In the {{smelting}} {{process of}} using huge bellows driven by waterwheels, {{massive amounts of}} charcoal {{were used in the}} production process, leading {{to a wide range of}} deforestation in northern China. However, by the end of the 11th century the Chinese discovered that using bituminous coke could replace the role of charcoal, hence many acres of forested land in northern China were spared from the steel and iron industry with this switch of resources. Iron and steel of this period were used to mass-produce ploughs, hammers, needles, pins, nails for ships, musical cymbals, chains for suspension bridges, Buddhist statues, and other routine items for an indigenous <b>mass</b> <b>market.</b> Iron was also a necessary manufacturing component for the production processes of salt and copper. Many newly constructed canals linked the major iron and steel production centers to the capital city's main market. This was also extended to trade with the outside world, which greatly expanded with the high level of Chinese maritime activity abroad during the Southern Song period.|$|E

5|$|In the 14th century, as Gothic art {{gave way}} to the International Gothic era, a number of schools {{developed}} in northern Europe. Early Netherlandish art originated in French courtly art, and is especially tied to the tradition and conventions of illuminated manuscripts. Modern art historians see the era as beginning with 14th-century manuscript illuminators. They were followed by panel painters such as Melchior Broederlam and Robert Campin, the latter generally considered the first Early Netherlandish master, under whom van der Weyden served his apprenticeship. Illumination reached a peak in the region in the decades after 1400, mainly due to the patronage of Burgundian and House of Valois-Anjou dukes such as Philip the Bold, Louis I of Anjou and Jean, Duke of Berry. This patronage continued in the low countries with the Burgundian dukes, Philip the Good and his son Charles the Bold. The demand for illuminated manuscripts declined {{towards the end of the}} century, perhaps because of the costly production process in comparison to panel painting. Yet illumination remained popular at the luxury end of the market, and prints, both engravings and woodcuts, found a new <b>mass</b> <b>market,</b> especially those by artists such as Martin Schongauer and Albrecht Dürer.|$|E
