France, represented in part by Barathay, was the 1993 World Champion and 1994 bronze medalist. Norway was the 1994 World Champion and 1993 runner-up and, with its Olympic duo, the 1995 bronze medalist, while Undset was also an Olympic silver medalist from the 1992 quadruple sculls. Germany had been runner-up at the last two editions of the World Championships and a bronze medalist in 1993. The lone exception to the dominance of these three nations was Denmark, who won the 1995 World Championships with Lars Christensen and Martin Haldbo Hansen. Australia, meanwhile, sent one of its defending Olympic champions, Peter Antonie, to Atlanta with a new partner, Jason Day.

40|$|Morphologically {{distinct}} binary polymer blends {{have been}} prepared by melt <b>mitring</b> of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and various linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPEs) for {{the entire range of}} blend composition under identical processing conditions. The morphology of the tensile fracture surfaces of the parent polymers and their blends are quite interesting and show good correlation with thermal and mechanical properties. The HOPE forms linear and interpenetrating fibrils with large interfibrillar separation, whereas, octene containing LLDPE (OLLDPE) with almost equal number of branching to that of HDPE shows nicely formed twisted fibrils. On the other hand, pentene containing LLDPE (PLLDPE) manifests a straight fibrillar morphology with well defined boundary comprising many thin fibrils with alternative thick and thin regimes and perfection, whilst butene containing LLDPE (SLLDPE) shows thick comparatively smooth and well defined and imperfect boundary of tensile fracture. The blends morphology is quite distinct to that of parent polymers. The physical properties, melting and crystallization behaviour show good correlation to the fineness, twisting and discontinuity of the fibrils.

40|$|Wireless {{communication}} {{is fast becoming}} the most common mode of communication. Invention of Bluetooth, WI-Fi, WiMAX, etc. have aided in popularizing wireless communication. Now wireless {{communication is}} being sought at for achieving communication in smart grid network. In a conventional power distribution system the power which was generated was being transmitted through the transmission link without {{taking into account the}} demand of the user. In a smart grid we address that issue. There is a flow of information from both sides. There are devices communicating with each other in sharing information. Advanced <b>mitring</b> scheme, dynamic pricing scheme have become new paradigm in smart grid. Research is going on for application of cognitive radios in smart grid communication. The spectrum used for communication is limited. Out of the channels available some have been licensed to certain users who are known as primary users. The other users are known as secondary users. The secondary users are large in number and the frequency channels available for them to communicate is limited in number. But the primary user use their allotted channels for very small amount of time. So, the secondary users can tap into those frequencies whenever it is idle. This can achieve efficiency in communication and help in reducing communication blockage of secondary users. Cognitive radios help in sensing the availability of the primary users in a channel and relay the data to secondary users so that they could use them. They also perform the task of switching the secondary users into another channel whenever a primary user uses that channel. In my work I have tried to find out an effective dynamic traffic scheduling scheme for effective communication purposes. First I had taken a scheme in which priority levels were assigned to different groups of secondary users without considering QoS of the channels.
