30|$|As {{done for}} the entire study area, data {{analysis}} was conducted for the whole set of individual porosity values at all sampled points in each of Horizons X and Y. In addition, {{for each of the}} two horizons, the means of porosity values within the horizon in each well (horizon well-mean) were obtained, and analysis conducted thereon. Figures  9, 10 present the analyses results for the individual porosity data sets, for the two horizons. The mean of the individual porosity data sets for Horizon X and Horizon Y is 0.2478 (95 % confidence interval of 0.2388 – 0.2567) and 0.2277 (95 % confidence interval of 0.2074 – 0.2480), respectively. The standard deviation for Horizon X data set is 0.0761, while the standard deviation for Horizon Y data set is 0.1158. The higher value of standard deviation in Horizon Y implies higher variability in Horizon Y than in Horizon X. The <b>modal</b> <b>class</b> for Horizon X is 20 – 25 %, while that of Horizon Y is 10 – 15 % with class 20 – 25 % occurring nearly as frequent as the <b>modal</b> <b>class.</b> For most of the statistics measures reported, Horizon X values seem to have more influence on the field-wide values than Horizon Y values have. This is due to the sampling size being larger in Horizon X (281) than in Horizon Y (127).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish a methodology for building a 3 D geological model of a mineral vein deposit, encompassing morphology and wolframite content. The available data set includes stope data (vein thickness and wolframite quantity) and borehole data (vein thickness and wolframite <b>modal</b> <b>classes).</b> The data captured from boreholes and stopes differ in terms of their spatial distribution and clustering as well as the size and shape of each sample. Therefore, a specific methodology was designed to combine these two sources of information. The morphology model mapped vein thickness as a vein proportion variable, by applying a two-phase Direct Sequential Simulation (DSS) locally conditioned to borehole data. Regarding the evaluation of wolframite content, the variables are unable to be related directly to each other and are non-co-located. Therefore, a proximity study was made using DSS to build local conditional cumulative histograms (by borehole class and by mine level). The final model of wolframite quantity was generated using Probability Field Simulation. The proposed approach considers the initially identified problems, allowing the mineral potential of the deposit to be quantified by integrating the results of the two independent methodologies...|$|R

In this study, the life history of this species was studied in Mar del Plata harbour (Argentina), a fully marine area where a stable and dense population has been established. Growth, sex proportion, morphological relationships, size at maturity and reproductive cycle were analysed between March 2007 and March 2009. A total of 9 and 7 <b>modal</b> <b>classes</b> (M 1 -M 9) were detected in the size frequency distributions of females and males, respectively. The modes of both sexes were the same until M 4 but from M 5 to M 7 females were larger than males. The life span was about one year with a clear seasonal growth. Recruitment and reproductive periods were recorded from December to March and October to March, respectively. The total sex ratio was biased to females. Nevertheless, a clear predominance of males was observed in classes smaller than 5. 25 mm carapace length (CL). Females reached maturity at a larger size in spring to early summer (October–January) than in late summer (February–March); the estimated sizes for 50 % sexual maturity were 6. 79 mm and 5. 91 mm CL, respectively.

40|$|Resolving {{the spatial}} {{variability}} in the population structure of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) requires a synoptic sample, as {{in the design of}} the CCAMLR 2000 Survey. However, this approach is not appropriate for assessing temporal variability. The size of krill in the diet of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) has been shown to provide a good representation of the temporal changes in the krill population structure from within their foraging area. At Cape Shirreff, South Shetland Islands, krill in nets had <b>modal</b> size <b>classes</b> of 46 - 48 mm and 52 - 54 mm in length and appeared to reflect the presence of larger krill offshore and smaller krill inshore; krill in the diet of fur seals contained both modes, indicating that the foraging area of fur seals integrated the spatial {{variability in the}} krill population. At Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, krill in nets and fur seal diets had a <b>modal</b> size <b>class</b> of 52 mm when sampled simultaneously; however, krill in the diet of seals showed a decline in size later in the season with an overall mode of 48 mm. At Bird Island, South Georgia, there was little overlap between net samples, with a <b>modal</b> size <b>class</b> of 30 - 40 mm, and fur seal diets, with distinct modes of 44 and 54 mm; and there was also much greater spatial variability in the size of krill in these net samples than in those from the other two locations. Extending the comparison of krill size in the diet of seals, to include spatially congruent net samples collected immediately prior to the CCAMLR 2000 Survey, showed almost complete overlap and indicated an even greater spatial variability in the krill population structure at South Georgia. Interactions between the oceanographic transport and enhanced growth rates of krill at South Georgia may combine to produce a higher degree of spatial variability in the krill population compared to other locations and this may limit the use of differences in krill length as an indicator of their provenance.

40|$|In Varano lagoon (Puglia, Italy) the bivalve Loripes lacteus (Linnaeus, 1758) {{constitutes}} {{the most abundant}} species among the organisms of the benthic macrofauna. This work {{presents the results of}} five years (from 2001 at 2006) of observations on the abundance, size/age population structure and spatial distribution of this species within the basin (6500 ha). L. lacteus {{is one of the most}} common and frequent bivalve species in Mediterranean lagoons. It typically occurs in reduced sediments where it is able to live at low oxygen concentration due to a particular respiratory pigment haemoglobin. Lucinid bivalves house symbiotic, sulphur-oxydizing chemoautotrophic bacterias in their gills, which contribute substantially to their nutrition. The design was to perform two sampling campaignes on yearly basis during the intermediate seasons (Spring and Autumn), when possible. Each sampling was realized collecting 53 sampling units taken from 53 stations distributed regularly over the lagoon surface. Each sampling unit consisted in all the individuals contained in a solid 15 x 15 x 20 cm of sediment and held on 1 mm mesh. Growth patterns were determined with the Bhattacharya method which uses modal progression analysis from size frequency distribution. The results showed a spatial distribution of L. lacteus which occurred in patches and changed among samples. The population analysis showed two <b>modal</b> <b>classes</b> for each sampling time.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{reproductive}} biology of the loliginid squid, Alloteuthis subulata in the North Sea, Irish Sea and Portuguese waters was carried out. A predominance of small squid (< 50 mm ML) during autumn was observed in all three areas. Multi-modal size-frequency distributions were apparent in both sexes. The greatest complexity was observed in Portuguese waters, with males exhibiting possibly four or more <b>modal</b> size <b>classes.</b> Sexually mature squid were found throughout the year, with generally more mature squid in spring-summer and fewer in autumn-winter. In Portuguese waters, maturity in both sexes peaked in spring, whereas maturity in the other areas peaked in summer. Similar sizes-at-maturity were observed, with male squid maturing over a greater size range (40 - 125 mm ML) than females (30 - 50 mm ML). An apparent secondary peak in male maturity at 65 mm ML suggests two different size-maturation patterns in Portuguese waters. Estimates of potential fecundity in the Irish Sea ranged from ∼ 2200 - 13 500 eggs per female. Mean egg diameters of 0. 45 mm and 1. 55 mm were recorded for developing oocytes and mature ova, respectively. Three to four <b>modal</b> size <b>classes</b> of oocytes were apparent in each ovary. There was some indication of latitudinal effects on growth, maturation and reproduction of A. subulata across its geographic range.

40|$|Theoretical and {{empirical}} {{studies suggest that}} the total energy available in natural communities influences body size as well as patterns of abundance and diversity. But the precise mechanisms underlying relationships or how these three ecological properties relate remain elusive. We identify five hypotheses relating energy availability, body size distributions, abundance, and species richness within communities, and we use experimental deep sea wood fall communities to test their predicted effects both on descriptors describing the species richness-body size distribution, and on trends in species richness within size classes over an energy gradient (size class-richness relationships). Invertebrate communities were taxonomically identified, weighed, and counted from 32 Acacia sp. logs ranging in size from 0. 6 to 20. 6 kg (corresponding to different levels of energy available) which were deployed at 3203 m in the Northeast Pacific Ocean for between 5 and 7 years. Trends in both the species richness-body size distribution and the size class-richness distribution with increasing wood fall size provide support for the Increased Packing hypothesis: species richness increases with increasing wood fall size but only in the <b>modal</b> size <b>class.</b> Furthermore, species richness of body size classes reflected the abundance of individuals in that size class. Thus, increases in richness in the <b>modal</b> size <b>class</b> with increasing energy were concordant with increases in abundance within that size class.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{resonant}} behaviour of slotted tubes, clamped {{at one end}} but free at the other, has been investigated to {{determine the influence of}} slot length upon their characteristic normal modes. FEM simulations have been performed for a series of steel tubes, identical apart from having slots of different lengths, but constant equal widths, running parallel to their symmetry axes. Three dimensional visualizations of the results allowed different <b>modal</b> <b>classes</b> to be identified. The lower frequency region of the spectrum was dominated by longitudinal, breathing and transverse modes. Other classes, such as oval modes, appeared progressively as the frequency increased. The results were checked experimentally using ESPI to view the tubes while exciting them using a magnetic transducer. This provided experimental confirmation of the mode classifications. It was found that the frequencies of the transverse modes and of the breathing modes were lowered as the slot was lengthened. The frequencies of the longitudinal modes were almost unaffected by slots of any size. Where modes occurred in degenerate pairs, always as predicted by group representation theory, the splitting increased with slot length. This was by as much as 100 % of the lower frequency in the case of higher order transverse modes. From the FEM simulations a previously unknown type of modal form has been observed.

The whole-rock A/I results support periodic deposition initiated during MIS 5 e, continuing through MIS 5 c, and then peaking {{at the end of}} MIS 5 a, about 70, 000 – 80, 000 yr ago. Oceanographic evidence indicates the area was subjected to much colder conditions during MIS 2 – 4 (10, 000 to 70, 000 yr ago), greatly slowing the epimerization rate. Eolianite deposition resumed in the mid Holocene (6000 yr ago) up to the present. The A/I epimerization pathway constructed from Rottnest Island shows remarkable similarity to that of Bermuda in the North Atlantic (32 ° N Latitude). These findings suggest that, like Bermuda, the eolian activity on Rottnest occurred primarily during or shortly after interglacial highstands when the shoreline was near the present datum, rather than during glacial lowstands when the coastline was positioned 10 – 20 km to the west...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} distribution of aggregate {{size of the}} diffuse and florid-type prion protein (PrP) plaques was studied in various brain regions in cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). The size distributions were unimodal and positively skewed and resembled those of β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down's syndrome (DS). The {{frequency distribution}}s of the PrP aggregates were log-normal in shape, but there were deviations from the expected number of plaques in specific size classes. More diffuse plaques were observed in the <b>modal</b> size <b>class</b> and fewer in the larger size classes than expected and more florid plaques {{were present in the}} larger size classes compared with the log-normal model. It was concluded that the growth of the PrP aggregates in vCJD does not strictly follow a log-normal model, diffuse plaques growing to within a more restricted size range and florid plaques to larger sizes than predicted. © Springer-Verlag 2005...|$|R
40|$|Taiwan, {{because of}} its location, is a flood prone region and is characterised by typhoons which brings about two-thirds to three {{quarters}} of the annual rainfall amount. Consequently, enormous flows result in rivers and entrain some fractions of the grains that constitute the riverbed. Hence, {{the purpose of the study}} is to quantify the impacts of these enormous flows on the distribution of grain size in riverbeds. The characteristics of riverbed material prior to and after the typhoon season are compared in Shi-Wen River located at southern Taiwan. These include grain size variation, bimodality, and roughness coefficient. A decrease (65 %) and increase (50 %) in geometric mean size of grains were observed for subsurface and surface bed material, respectively. Geometric standard deviation decreased in all sites after typhoon. Subsurface material was bimodal prior to typhoons and polymodal after. For surface material, <b>modal</b> <b>class</b> is in the gravel class, while after typhoons it shifts towards cobble class. The reduction in geometric mean resulted to a decrease in roughness coefficient by up to 30 %. Finally, the relationship of Shields and Froude numbers are studied and a change in the bed form to antidunes and transition form is observed, respectively...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} work {{developed}} with three Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) scenes from three intra-annual time periods within {{a research project}} of the Remote Sensing Unit (GDR) from the Portuguese Geographic Institute (IGP). The goal was to produce a land cover map using an approach that combines the per-field classification and the object oriented image analysis. First, the AWiFS scenes were segmented to produce objects {{to be used as}} classification units. Second, per-pixel classification was performed with decision trees. The training observation collection consisted in a deterministically identification of single pixels spread across the study area concerning a 15 -class nomenclature. Third, each object was classified with the <b>modal</b> <b>class</b> provided by the previous per-pixel classification. Four, the combined pixel/object classification was generalized to a minimum mapping unit of 10 ha with an in-house developed software. Finally, the land cover map was evaluated based on a probabilistic accuracy assessment. The methodology was tested on a study area located in Tagus and Sado watersheds. This study area was selected due to its characteristics, such as land cover variety and landscape heterogeneity, that are representative of the Portuguese territory. The land cover map produced with the developed approach has an overall accuracy of 66. 9 %. Pages: 7781 - 778...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{studies of}} the mud crab, Scylla serrata (Forskal) {{collected}} from the Sundarbans mangrove ecosystem of Bangladesh were conducted during May, 2001 to February, 2002. The overall sex ratio of male to female {{was found to be}} 1 : 0. 94. The sex ratio was uneven in most size groups and in most of the months. The <b>modal</b> <b>class</b> size was 81 - 90 mm Carapace Width (CW) in male and 71 - 80 mm in female. The monthly size-frequency distribution exhibited some variations. The relationship between carapace width and body weight were estimated as W = - 128. 25 + 4. 06 CW, log W = - 3. 73 + 3. 06 log CW or, W = 0. 0078 CW 3. 06 for male and W = - 89. 59 + 2. 387 CW, logW = - 1. 6035 + 1. 8928 log CW or, W = 0. 005 CW 1. 8928 for female. The condition factor of male crabs showed two peaks; first in 61 - 70 mm and second in 121 - 130 mm size group. In case of female it was highest in 61 - 70 mm size group. The relative condition factor was maximum at 125. 5 mm CW and 65. 5 mm CW in male and female, respectively. Gonadosomatic Index showed a single peak during May to July for female crabs...|$|E

The <b>class</b> of positive <b>modal</b> algebras is the one canonically associated with PML according {{to the theory of}} the algebraization of logics. In [4], a Priestley-style duality is established between the category of positive modal algebras and the category of K+-spaces. In this paper, we establish a categorical equivalence between the category K+ of K+-spaces and the category Coalg(V) of coalgebras of a suitable endofunctor V on the category of Priestley spaces...|$|R

The <b>classes</b> of frames characterized by the axioms of these systems are shown to be first-order definable, though not equal to the classes of serial, transitive, or euclidean frames. The canonical frame of the non-contingency logic of any logic containing the seriality axiom is proved to be non-serial. It is also shown that any class of frames definable in the non-contingency language contains the class of functional frames, and dually, there exists a greatest consistent normal non-contingency logic...|$|R

Dietary composition of the <b>modal</b> sardine length <b>class</b> was assessed by determining the frequency of occurrence and carbon content of identified prey, and these 2 parameters were combined to estimate a modified index of relative importance of prey (mIRI). The most important prey for sardines were zooplankton, comprising crustacean eggs, copepods, decapods, cirripedes and fish eggs, dinoflagellates and diatoms (particularly the toxin-producer genus Pseudo-nitzschia), which together accounted for > 90...|$|R
