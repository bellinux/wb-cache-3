Construction {{of a new}} plant increased brewing capacity from 1 million to 1.3 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> year. In 1989, the derelict former maltings building was converted into brewery offices in a £4 million project. Also, a new distribution depot was constructed in Elland.|$|E

Tetley Walker owned over one {{thousand}} tied houses in Yorkshire alone and a further two thousand outside the county. In 1961 Tetley merged with Ind Coope and Ansells to form Allied Breweries, then the world's largest brewing conglomerate. During the 1960s the brewery employed {{over a thousand}} workers. A new brewhouse was built in 1964. By the 1970s half of Leeds' pubs were owned by Tetley. During the 1970s Tetley's was Britain's largest cask ale brewery, producing 1 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> year. In 1978 Allied merged with J. Lyons to form Allied Lyons.|$|E

25|$|In 1947 an {{even bigger}} field opened at Leduc, 20 miles (32km) south of Edmonton, and in 1948 oil mining began at Redwater. Both these fields were overshadowed in {{importance}} in 1956 {{with the discovery of}} the Pembina field west of Edmonton. Other fields were discovered east of Grande Prairie and in central Alberta. From collection and distribution points near Edmonton the oil is sent by pipeline to refineries, some as distant as Sarnia, Toronto and Montreal to the east, Vancouver to the west, and especially the U.S. to the South. Interprovincial Pipe Line (IPL) began in 1949, transporting oil to refineries in the east. IPL became Enbridge Pipelines in 1998 and now has 4500 employees; it moves 2 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> day over 13,500 miles of pipe.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critics of}} Western {{military}} intervention suggested that resources—not democratic or humanitarian concerns—were the real {{impetus for the}} intervention, among them a journalist of London Arab nationalist newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi, the Russian TV network RT and the (then-)leaders of Venezuela and Zimbabwe, Hugo Chávez and Robert Mugabe. Gaddafi's Libya, despite its relatively small population, was known to possess vast resources, particularly {{in the form of}} oil reserves and financial capital. Libya is a member of OPEC and one of the world's largest oil producers. It was producing roughly 1.6 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> day before the war, nearly 70 percent of them through the state-owned National Oil Corporation. Additionally, the country's sovereign wealth fund, the Libyan Investment Authority, was {{one of the largest in}} the world, controlling assets worth approximately US$56 billion, including over 100 tons of gold reserves in the Central Bank of Libya.|$|E

50|$|Thanks to a {{joint effort}} by Corpoelec and PDVS Gas, Chacón {{achieved}} the migration from liquid fuel gasoil to gas in thermoelectric units. A total of 21 units was enabled to use gas (app. 1390MW), which represents savings of 64 <b>million</b> gasoil <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> year. Another important advancement was the reinforcement of preventive and corrective maintenance works in 28 generating units.|$|R
500|$|By 1989 Stones was {{the ninth}} most popular {{beer in the}} United Kingdom, with 2 per cent of all beer sales. Demand was such that the Cannon Brewery was paying up to £1.5 million per month in duty by 1991. Cask {{conditioned}} Stones won silver in the Bitter category in the CAMRA Champion Beer of Britain in 1991. By 1992 Stones was the UK's highest selling bitter, <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>a</b> year brand, with Bass describing it as [...] "a tremendously important brand with untapped potential". That same year, Bass were criticised for reducing the ABV of Stones from 4.1 per cent to 3.9 per cent ABV {{in order to reduce}} the impact of beer duty.

The article stated that as Vitol is based in Switzerland, which did not implement Western sanctions, Vitol had skirted the charges.|$|R
5000|$|The Illinois Basin has {{produced}} more than four billion barrels of petroleum. [...] Major oil production began in 1905, and from 1907 through 1912, the basin was the third-most oil productive area in the United States. Oil production peaked in 1908 at 34 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> per year, and declined steadily to 5 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> in 1933. <b>A</b> new wave of exploration brought oil production to a new high of 140 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> in 1940, after which production again declined.

50|$|Among {{them was}} a plan to bomb the Ras Tanura Oil Production facility, which was {{responsible}} for approximately 7 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> of oil daily. For comparison, the entire country of Kuwait produced around 1.5 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> of oil <b>a</b> day, which alone caused oil prices {{around the world to}} double after the Iraqi invasion This was the only operation of all their ones planned that was attempted, although their plan to attack landing Marines was on call and ready to go at a moments notice should they ever have attempted the amphibious invasion.

In June, the company secured a $230 million loan from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China to finance its expansion. In September, ENOC tapped French engineering firm Technip to lead a self-financed $1bn expansion of its Jebel Ali plant to increase its refining capacity by 50 per cent, or 70,000 barrels per day, to a total of 210,000 bpd.

The F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Company had fallen victim to the Miller beer wars and Stroh's purchased all of Schaefer's stock. In 1981, the combined breweries ranked seventh in beer sales. In addition, Stroh was {{able to take advantage of}} Schaefer's distributors in the northeastern part of the country.

Oil production didn't completely recover in November, so there were some additional losses, but did completely return in December.|$|E
