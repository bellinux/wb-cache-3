5|$|Constructing {{composite}} bows requires <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> and {{a greater}} variety of materials than self bows, and the animal glue used can lose strength in humid conditions; the 6th-century Byzantine military manual, the Strategikon, advised the cavalry of the Byzantine army, many of whom were armed with composite bows, to keep their bows in leather cases to keep them dry. Karpowicz suggests that crafting a composite bow may take a week's work, excluding drying time (months) and gathering materials, while a self bow can be made in a day and dried in a week. Peoples living in humid or rainy regions historically have favoured self-bows, while those living in dry or arid regions have favoured composite bows.|$|E
5|$|When fit, Miller {{opened the}} Test bowling with Lindwall, and the pair bowled in short and fiery bursts {{with the new}} ball. The English cricket {{authorities}} had agreed {{to make a new}} ball available every 55 overs. The pre-existing rule stipulated that a replacement ball would be available every 200 runs, which usually took <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to accumulate. This played directly {{into the hands of the}} Australians with their vastly stronger pace attack, as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling. Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice bowlers for a fresh attack every 55 overs. With 13 wickets in the Tests, Miller was third among the Australians behind Lindwall and Johnston, who took 27 apiece. Owing to his fragility, Miller was used sparingly compared to the other four Australian frontline bowlers: Toshack and Johnson each delivered more than 170 overs despite playing in one less Test, while Lindwall bowled 224 and Johnston 306 in five matches. In all first-class matches, Miller took 56wickets at 17.58 and held onto 20 catches. There were many consecutive matches during the tour with no intervening rest day, so Bradman ensured that his leading pace duo remained fresh for the new ball bursts in the Tests by giving them a smaller proportion of the bowling during the tour matches. During all first-class matches, Johnston bowled 851.1 overs, Johnson 668, Lindwall 573.4 and Toshack 502, while Miller bowled only 429.4 overs. Doug Ring—who was only selected in one Test—bowled 542.4 overs, while all rounders Colin McCool and Loxton bowled 399.4 and 361.2 overs respectively. McCool did not play in any Tests, while Loxton was only entrusted with 63 overs against England. As such, in some tour matches, Miller was not asked to bowl at all, in order to keep him fresh for the Tests.|$|E

CNC lathes, CNC milling machines, and CNC camshaft grinders will be used during production. Different types of steel bar can be used, one example being EN40b. When manufacturing a camshaft from EN40b, the camshaft will also be heat treated via gas nitriding, which changes the micro-structure of the material. It gives a surface hardness of 55-60 HRC.

25|$|In practice, {{the target}} failed to stay {{centered}} in the sighting telescope {{when it was first}} set up. Instead, due to inaccuracies in the estimated wind speed and direction, the target would drift in the sight. To correct for this, the bombardier would use fine-tuning controls to slowly cancel out any motion through trial and error. These adjustments had the effect of updating the measured ground speed used to calculate the motion of the prisms, slowing the visible drift. Over {{a short period of time}} of continual adjustments, the drift would stop, and the bombsight would now hold an extremely accurate measurement of the exact ground speed and heading. Better yet, these measurements were being carried out on the bomb run, not before it, and helped eliminate inaccuracies due to changes in the conditions as the aircraft moved. And by eliminating the manual calculations, the bombardier was left with <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to adjust his measurements, and thus settle at a much more accurate result.|$|E

25|$|While in the wild, dung {{constitutes}} {{a majority of}} the nutritional intake used for sexual development in both male and female adults within this species, but diets consisting of higher protein contents will better facilitate mating conditions of both sexes. Female sexual maturity requires the completion of 10 stages of follicle development in the ovaries to produce eggs that are completely mature, and ovaries in females which have been deprived of a high-protein diet will not develop fully. Although it is possible for females on a diet of only dung to reach the final stage of sexual maturity, it takes <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> than if they were to feed exclusively on beef liver; even then, a lower percentage of those feeding on dung will have fully developed. For instance, an experiment by Stoffolano showed that 100% of females feeding exclusively on beef liver were able to reach the final stage of sexual development after 13 days, while only 78% of females were able to do so when feeding exclusively on pig dung over a 20-day period. Although some dipteran species will oviposit on dung, P. regina oviposits exclusively on carrion.|$|E
25|$|In March 1801, {{weeks after}} the {{election}} of 1800 was resolved, two amendments were proposed in the New York state legislature that would form the skeleton of the Twelfth Amendment. Governor John Jay submitted to the state legislature an amendment that would require district election of electors in each state and Jedidiah Peck, {{a member of the}} lower house, submitted an amendment to adopt designation for the votes for President and Vice President. The two amendments were not considered until early 1802, as the state legislature took a break for the summer and winter. New York state senator DeWitt Clinton moved for the adoption of the amendment in January 1802 and shortly thereafter won a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate, where he was instrumental in bringing the designation amendment to Congress. The process continued in New York on February 15, when Representative Benjamin Walker of New York proposed the designation and district election amendments to the House. Debate on the amendments began in May and the Republicans wanted to quickly decide on the amendments and go home for the summer, while the Federalists argued that these ideas needed <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> than allowed for in the current session. Federalist Samuel W. Dana of Connecticut wanted an examination of the necessity of a Vice President. The amendment ultimately failed in the New York State Senate, but DeWitt Clinton was able to bring amendment talks to the House.|$|E
25|$|Since {{one might}} not travel faster than light, one might {{conclude}} that a human can never travel further from the Earth than 40 light-years if the traveler is active between the age of 20 and 60. A traveler would then {{never be able to}} reach more than the very few star systems which exist within the limit of 20–40 light-years from the Earth. This is a mistaken conclusion: because of time dilation, the traveler can travel thousands of light-years during their 40 active years. If the spaceship accelerates at a constant 1g (in its own changing frame of reference), it will, after 354 days, reach speeds a little under the speed of light (for an observer on Earth), and time dilation will increase their lifespan to thousands of Earth years, seen from the reference system of the Solar System, but the traveler's subjective lifespan will not thereby change. If the traveler returns to the Earth, she or he will land thousands of years into the Earth's future. Their speed will not be seen as higher than the speed of light by observers on Earth, and the traveler will not measure their speed as being higher than the speed of light, but will see a length contraction of the universe in their direction of travel. And as the traveler turns around to return, the Earth will seem to experience <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> than the traveler does. So, while their (ordinary) coordinate speed cannot exceed c, their proper speed (distance as seen by Earth divided by their proper time) can be much greater than c. This is seen in statistical studies of muons traveling much further than c times their half-life (at rest), if traveling close to c.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{his most}} {{significant}} engineering failure, {{as noted by}} division chief Yuri Demyanko, was his insistence that hydrogen was unsuitable {{for use as a}} rocket fuel. As a result, the Soviet space program was still discussing the use of hydrogen-fueled engines while the Americans were assembling the Saturn V launcher. Also, Glushko's design bureau consistently failed at building a rocket engine powered by LOX/Kerosene with a large combustion chamber to rival the American F1 used on the Saturn V; instead, his solution was the RD-270, a single large combustion-chamber engine powered by hypergolic fuels which had almost the same thrust and better specific impulse as compared to the US F-1 rocket engine in addition to using the very advanced full-flow staged combustion concept as opposed to the simple gas generator cycle used by the F-1 rocket engine. This was a primary reason for the failure of the N1, which was forced to rely on a multitude of smaller engines for propulsion because Sergei Korolev, its chief designer, insisted on using the LOX/Kerosene combination, which Glushko felt would take <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> and money to design. Glushko never did overcome the combustion instability problems of large rocket motors using kerosene propellants; his eventual solution for this is seen on the RD-170 which is basically four smaller combustion chamber/nozzle assemblies sharing common fuel delivery systems. This solution and engine gave the Soviets the large thrust propulsion needed to build the Energia superbooster, and is probably the finest technical example of Glushko's abilities when he was at his best. The fact that he never developed this solution until the firing of Vasily Mishin and his gaining ultimate control of the entire Soviet space program {{is a testament to the}} paralyzing intrigue and in-fighting that went on within the Soviet effort to reach the Moon.|$|E

The horn is on the belly, facing the archer, and sinew on the outer side of a wooden core.
