During this same period the RAE {{was approached by}} United States Army Air Forces' (USAAF) General Jimmy Doolittle with a request for help, as the 8th Air Force had been having trouble when their Lightning, Thunderbolt and Mustang aircraft, providing top cover for the bombers, dived down onto attacking German fighters, some of the diving U.S. fighters encountering speed regions where they became difficult to control. As a result of Doolittle's request, early in 1944 the P-38H Lightning, Packard Merlin-powered P-51B Mustang and P-47C Thunderbolt were dived for compressibility testing at the RAE by Brown and several other pilots. The results of the tests were that the tactical Mach numbers, i.e., the <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>limits,</b> were Mach 0.68 for the Lightning, Mach 0.71 for the Thunderbolt and Mach 0.78 for the Mustang. The corresponding figure for both the Fw 190 and Bf 109 was Mach 0.75. The tests flown by Brown and his colleagues resulted in Doolittle being able to argue with his superiors for the Mustang to be chosen in preference to the P-38 and P-47 for all escort duties from then on.|$|R

40|$|Using {{the case}} of the hybrid media system of Uganda and Schimank’s {{approach}} of agent-structure dynamics, this article argues that media freedom and journalists’ autonomy first and foremost depend on society’s expectations of the media system. Closely linked to those informal structures of expectations which are path and time dependent, journalists’ room for <b>manoeuvre</b> is <b>limited</b> by the resources allocated to individual and collective media actors. In a first step and following Schimank’s approach, the article presents a category system that could drive the analysis of media freedom in Uganda and beyond. The empirical study is based on research material consisting of 30 expert interviews, two elite round tables on site in Uganda and documents. This material shows that both journalists’ working conditions and (related to this and even more important) their perception among the ruling elites, public administrations and those governed, limit media freedom. It is precisely the media’s relative societal position which allowed the government to implement a system of media laws and media regulation authorities which creates arbitrariness and, therefore, a feeling of insecurity within the profession.

While the shadow of hierarchy is important to ensure the effectiveness of {{social dialogue}}, social dialogue procedures are not characterised by strong principal-agent relationships. In particular, non-statutory agreements stem from a bottom-up private sector-inspired tradition of industrial relations. Even in the case of statutory agreements, the European Commission, as principal, does not appoint the agent and the delegation is implicit rather than explicit.

Among the different layout of the electric power-train, four in-wheel motors appear to be one of the most attractive.

Furthermore the possibility of independently distribute braking and driving torques on the wheels allows to generate a yaw moment able to improve vehicle handling (torque vectoring). In this paper a torque vectoring control strategy for an electric vehicle with four in-wheel motors is presented.

More precisely, the modelling is based on the improved Directed Potential Field (DPF) method for trajectory planning. The method has facilitated the formulation of a simple behaviour model that is also linear in parameters. To obtain the steering data for parameter identification, seven individuals participated in driving the wheelchair in different virtual worlds on the augmented platform.

Though large areas of the High North remain unexplored, there are reasons to believe that it contains vast petroleum resources. Norway and Russia are two of the world’s leading petroleum producers, and the resources of the High North have {{the potential}} to further increase the countries’ position as large petroleum producers. Furthermore, Russia and Norway are neighbouring countries that share a tense past from the Cold War. Today, the differences between the West and the East have faded, and Russia and Norway interact peacefully on a number of issue area. However, whereas Norway is small state, Russia is a great country. Consequently, there will always exist an asymmetrical relationship between the two. This thesis seeks {{to examine the relationship between}} Norway and Russia in the High North, with regard to petroleum cooperation.

This study was undertaken to determine whether respiratory physicians manage patients with alpha- 1 -antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency differently from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without alpha- 1 -antitrypsin deficiency. In addition we obtained physicians' views on who should be tested for AAT deficiency. A questionnaire was administered to 88 respiratory physicians based throughout the U. K. (44 in teaching hospitals). The main outcome measures were pulmonary function tests, radiological assessment, frequency of repeat testing, follow-up and screening protocol for alpha- 1 -antitrypsin deficiency. Subjects with homozygous (PiZ) AAT deficiency were more likely to: 1. have baseline and full pulmonary function testing including dynamic flow rates, static lung volumes, and gas transfer; 2. have more comprehensive assessment with high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) thorax and repeated radiological assessment (with annual chest radiography); 3. be followed-up routinely; and 4. have family members tested for alpha- 1 -antitrypsin deficiency. Testing remains limited for AAT deficiency and is mainly restricted to young patients with COPD. COPD assessment and management is influenced by the presence of AAT deficiency, which may reflect the poorer prognosis of such patients due to more rapid decline. Assessment and monitoring could be simplified to forced expired <b>manoeuvres,</b> although <b>limited</b> HRCT thorax and tests of gas transfer may prove more sensitive to progression of emphysema. Testing for AAT deficiency in the U. K. remains restricted, which will influence the detection rate for AAT deficiency.

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine how they understand and use their discretion in their daily work. We used a qualitative method and the data was gathered by semi-structured interviews with eight employment officers working at the same office in a small town in Sweden. Lipskys theory about street-level bureaucracy and Lazarus description of coping theory are applied to analyze the empirical data. The work for the Swedish employment officers have changed over the last years with an increasing focus on control and administration. The results from the study show that the employment officers considered that they have a freedom of action in their daily work about planning their meetings, but all of them thinks that the administration, and the fact that they have to handle too many unemployed means that they are lack of time, what leads to a negative impact on their discretion. All of the interviewed subjects indicated that the Swedish public employment service has a top-down organization. We found that the informants used a unified strategy to cope dilemmas by referring to the existing laws, both when they handled disgruntled unemployed and even as a way to cope their own liable situations. They could interpret the laws in different ways and they took help from the colleagues at the local office to decide how to interpret the laws.

40|$|This thesis has two {{principal}} objectives: firstly, {{to provide a}} systematic account {{of the evolution of}} Brazil's international role during the twenty-one years of military rule from 1964 to 1985 and, secondly, to evaluate the extent to which developments in Brazilian foreign relations during this period have enabled the country to attain a more autonomous and independent role in world affairs. The first part of the thesis outlines the major themes of Brazilian foreign policy before 1964. It argues that in the early post-war period Brazil's international freedom of <b>manoeuvre</b> was <b>limited</b> by {{two principal}} factors: the consolidation of United States hegemony over Latin America and the absence of alternative relationships. The following five chapters then trace the evolution of foreign policy under the five military presidents that ruled Brazil between 1964 and 1985. Each chapter charts the major foreign policy initiatives of the various governments, isolates the underlying principles on which foreign policy was based and analyses the major political and economic factors which shaped Brazilian diplomacy. In each case the analysis is organised around two crucial developments: the changing character of relations with the United States and the progress towards diversification. Part Three seeks to evaluate Brazil's changing international role. It argues that Brazil's level of autonomy has increased over the period as a result both of a decline in United States hegemony over Brazil and of the successful diversification of Brazil's foreign relations and the expansion of political and economic contacts with Western Europe, Japan, the socialist countries and the Third World. It nevertheless also argues that Brazil's freedom of manoeuvre is much more constrained than many of the accounts of the 1970 s suggested and that the debt crisis has underlined both the continued centrality of relations with Washington and the fragility of many of the new ties that were so successfully builk up during the 1970 s...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} value {{transfer}} {{and critical thinking}} in Swedish upper secondary education. The Curriculum for the Non-Compulsory School System (Lpf 94) entrusts a dual function to schools and teachers. They are tasked with, first, conveying to pupils, con-solidating and transferring values that underpin our community life and, second, foster-ing pupils’ critical thinking and independent attitudes towards issues relating to life and values. The present study investigates and problematises tensions in schools and the teaching situation between value transfer and the pupils’ training in critical thinking. The theoretical framework of this thesis centres on the academic perspectives and work originated, and provided with tools, by Michel Foucault, Norman Fairclough, Valerie Walkerdine and Stephen Ball. This study was inspired by ethnographic method and tradition. The empirical approach of the thesis is based on fieldwork carried out at three upper secondary schools. The overall finding is that, {{for the majority of}} pupils in the study, a subject position is made available with very limited scope for criticism and questioning. The pupils’ room for <b>manoeuvre</b> is <b>limited</b> mainly through articulations of an order discourse and a knowledge-reproducing discourse. For pupils, the order discourse normalises an attitude characterised by approval, docility, compliance and loyalty in relation to the school and to what the school asks its pupils to do. It is typical of pupils in the knowledge-reproducing discourse that docility and compliance are also expected to include actual knowledge content and, by the same token, the versions of the truth that it dictates. The discourses combine to place pupils in a subordinate posi-tion in relation both to the school, teachers and ways of working and to the knowledge content. When the order discourse and/or the knowledge-reproducing discourse is articulated, the pupil gets no training in questioning, critically oriented activity, nor any encouragement or persuasion to engage in it. The only example of planned training in critical reflection that was observed in the fieldwork was in a traditional academic programme...|$|R

It also declared in a constitutional amendment passed on 28 September 1990 that its TO would be under the sole command of the Slovenian government. At the same time, the Slovenian government set up a secret alternative command structure, known as the Manoeuvre Structures of National Protection (Manevrska struktura narodne zaščite, or MSNZ). This was an existing but antiquated institution, unique to Slovenia, which was intended to enable the republic to form an ad hoc defence structure, akin to a Home Guard. It was of negligible importance prior to 1990, with antiquated weapons and few members. However, the DEMOS-led government realised that the MSNZ could be adapted to provide a parallel organisation to the TO that would be entirely in the hands of the Slovenian government.When the YPA tried to take control of the Slovenian Territorial Defence (TO), the TO's command structure was simply replaced by that of the parallel MSNZ. Between May and October 1990, some 21,000 Slovenian Territorial Defence and police personnel were secretly mobilised into the MSNZ command structure, of which the federal government was wholly unaware. The Slovenian government also undertook detailed planning of a military campaign against the YPA, which resulted in the production of an operational and tactical plan by November 1990 — over seven months before the conflict actually began.The Slovenes were aware that they would not be able to deter the YPA forces for an extended period of time.

The method does not attempt to model the driver but rather replaces the driver with methods normally associated with numerical optimal control. The use of constraints on the method is then considered to represent the performance limits of the human driver. The method simultaneously finds the optimal driven line and the driver control inputs (steer, throttle and brake) to drive this line in minimum time. The method is in principle capable of operation with arbitrarily complex vehicle models as it requires only limited access to the vehicle model state vector. It also requires solution of the differential equation representing the vehicle model in only the forward time direction and is hence capable of simulating the full vehicle transient response. The impact of various vehicle parameters on minimum manoeuvre time, driven line and vehicle stability is shown for a number of representative manoeuvres using a quasi-steady state vehicle model. A similar process is then carried out to analyse the effect of suspension springs and dampers using a fully dynamic sprung vehicle model. The presented transient time optimal control method is then compared with results obtained from a traditional quasi-steady state manoeuvre time simulation method. A thermodynamic tyre model is developed and the time optimal control algorithm is used to evaluate dynamic tyre temperature effects on lap time and vehicle stability...|$|R
40|$|School-based cycling {{education}} programs aim to improve cycling safety and participation amongst children. Available {{research suggests that}} typical programs, which focus on bicycle <b>manoeuvring</b> skills, have <b>limited</b> effects on behaviour observed on a track or planned route. The current study uses theoretically more valid, naturalistic cycling data, to evaluate Safe Cycle, a program that incorporates hazard and selfawareness training. Soon after Safe Cycle was delivered at treatment schools, research bicycles instrumented with a rearward- and a forwardfacing camera were loaned to six children from treatment schools and six children from (waitlist) control schools. In each group half the children were in Year 6, and half were in Year 7 / 8. Each child was instructed to ride the research bicycle instead of their own bicycle for the 1 - 2 weeks {{that they had a}} research bicycle. Video data were reduced using a purpose-designed coding scheme that identified whether participants performed specific safety-relevant behaviours in appropriate circumstances. While the participants controlled their bicycles well, gave way appropriately to traffic at intersections, and stopped at red lights, participants frequently removed one or both hands from the handlebars, and seldom signalled turns, conducted over-shoulder-checks when changing lanes, or looked in multiple directions at intersections (except when crossing a road). While aspects of design and small sample sizes limited evaluation findings, this research demonstrated the feasibility and potential of naturalistic data to support cycling education program evaluation. Further, the study substantially extended available naturalistic study of children's cycling behaviour to highlight behaviours which might be targeted by cycling safety initiatives...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to define new {{quantitative}} parameters of dynamic Pelvic Floor Muscle (PFM) function using 2 D transperineal (TP) ultrasound imaging combined with image processing methods (IPM). Ultrasound and digital vaginal data were obtained from a volunteer convenience sample of 23 continent and 9 Stress Urinary Incontinent (SUI) women recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area community, California, U. S. A. Two methods of IPM were used; speckle tracking for measuring displacement of the ano-rectal angle (ARA) and symphysis pubis (SP); and segmentation IPM for measuring displacement of the urethra. Good to excellent inter and intra observer reliability was established for processing the ultrasound images on stored audio-visual imaging files (AVI). Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values: 0. 61 to 0. 99; 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 0. 08 ? 0. 84 to 0. 97 ? 0. 99; standard error of measurement (SEM) 0. 01 to 0. 25 cm. There was good agreement between measures on Bland and Altman analysis: mean difference 0. 06 to - 0. 21 cm; 95 % CI 0. 02 ? 0. 45 cm to - 0. 01 ? 0. 20 cm. Validity of the IPM was confirmed with digital palpation, and furthermore indicated good sensitivity and specificity. Technical and methodological limitations of the IPM, and suggestions for future studies were discussed. Several research questions were addressed using TP ultrasound combined with IPM that enabled the dynamic evaluation of pelvic floor (PF) displacement throughout an entire <b>manoeuvre,</b> rather than <b>limiting</b> the quantification from static images at rest to the end of the manoeuvre. In this way, IPM determined unique quantitative data regarding the automatic displacement, velocity and acceleration of the ARA and urethra during a cough, Valsalva, voluntary PFM contraction, The Knack and a Transversus Abdominis contraction. During automatic events that raised intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), normal PFM function produced timely compression of the PF and additional external support to the urethra, reducing the displacement, velocity, and acceleration. In women with SUI, who have weaker urethral attachments, this shortening contraction did not occur; consequently, the urethra of women with SUI moved further and faster for a longer duration. Caution regarding the generalisability of this study is warranted due to the small number of women in the SUI group and the significant difference in parity between groups. However this non-invasive physiological measurement tool demonstrated a new way of assessing the PFM. It is envisaged that this study will provide the foundation for future studies with larger parity matched populations and eventually improve the rehabilitation of women with SUI and other PF disorders...|$|R
