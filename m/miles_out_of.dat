5|$|At over 80, Mondragón {{was still}} able to mount on horseback, though he had to be helped by two men and could only wear light armour. He first came to {{prominence}} at the Battle of Mühlberg, in 1547, {{and was one of the}} few Spanish officers of good fame in the rebel provinces, being portrayed in a positive light by contemporaneous Dutch authors such as Hugo Grotius and Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft. Mondragón planned not only to relieve Groenlo, but also to lure Maurice into a pitched battle. The Dutch general, however, on receiving news of his enemy's march, set fire to supplies, tools and ammunitions gathered for the siege and retreated two <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Groenlo. Mondragón could therefore ressuply the town unmolested.|$|E
5|$|Manning's {{father took}} a job as an {{information}} technology (IT) manager for a rental car agency, which required travel. The family lived several <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> town, and Manning's mother was unable to drive. She spent her days drinking, while Manning was left largely to fend for herself, playing with Legos or on the computer. Brian would stock up on food before his trips, and leave pre-signed checks that Casey mailed to pay the bills. A neighbor said that whenever Manning's elementary school went on field trips, she would give her own son extra food or money so he could make sure Manning had something to eat. Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family.|$|E

25|$|After informing Carrie of his success, Brody {{goes with}} her to a safe house 100 <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Tehran. There, she tells him she is {{pregnant}} with his child. Saul assures her that Brody will be safely extracted, but his successor as CIA Director, Senator Andrew Lockhart (Tracy Letts), betrays their location to Javadi, who arranges their capture. Brody is convicted of treason and sentenced to death. Carrie tries desperately to secure his release, but to no avail. When she calls him in his cell, he asks her not {{to come to his}} execution. She goes anyway, however, and calls out his name as he is hanged in a public square.|$|E
25|$|New York State Route32A (NY32A) is a {{state highway}} in the Hudson Valley region of New York in the United States. It serves as a {{connector}} between NY32 {{in the town of}} Saugerties and NY23A in the town of Catskill. The road allows traffic from the Saugerties area, particularly from the New York State Thruway, to directly reach the interior of the Greene County portion of Catskill Park. The majority of traffic is tourism-oriented, from hikers in summer to skiers bound for Hunter Mountain in winter. If NY32A did not exist, drivers would have to go several <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their way to the intersection of NY32 and NY23A.|$|E

60|$|The house stood about a <b>mile</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the town, in a dip {{of ground}} near the famous fishing-stream. It was a lonely, old-fashioned red-brick building, {{surrounded}} by high walls, {{with a garden}} and plantation behind it.|$|R
25|$|McIntosh {{had planned}} to envelop Sigel's force from the {{northwest}} while Gates closed the trap on the south. However, McIntosh mistakenly took his 3,000-man cavalry brigade too far up a northerly road. After marching three <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his way, he turned his troopers onto the road leading east into the Little Sugar Creek valley. By {{the time they reached}} the site where Sigel's northeast road met McIntosh's east-bound road, the Federal general's men had already passed the intersection thus avoiding a disaster. When the 3rd Texas Cavalry charged, they ran smack into Sigel's main line. The Confederates lost 10 killed and about 20 wounded to Federal artillery and rifle fire and the Union position held.|$|E
25|$|By 1592 Kempe {{was one of}} Lord Strange's Men, {{listed in}} the Privy Council {{authorisation}} for that troupe to play seven <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> London. In 1594, upon the dissolution of Strange's Men, Kempe, along with Burbage and Shakespeare, joined the Lord Chamberlain's Men and remained with that company until early 1599, when a still-unclear sequence of events removed him from the company. Although {{he had been a}} sharer in the plans to construct the Globe Theatre, he appeared in no productions in the new theatre, which was open by mid-1599, and evidence from Shakespeare's Henry V, {{in which there is no}} promised continued role for Falstaff, and Hamlet, containing its famous complaint at improvisational clowning (Act 3, Scene 2), indicates some of the circumstances in which Kempe may have been dropped. Kemp played his last role for Shakespeare in 1598.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} October 24, 1937 radio show, where Jack proudly {{announced}} {{the purchase of}} his car, a running joke was that Benny drove an old Maxwell automobile, a brand that {{went out of business}} in 1925. Although some details such as the car's body style and its exact model year would vary over the years, what remained constant was that Benny's old car was so worn out that it would barely run, but the miserly Benny insisted he could get a few more <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. Many of the sound effects for the car’s clattering engine came from an actual old motor which the sound effects shop had salvaged from a Los Angeles junkyard. When a sound effects man missed a cue for the automobile engine, Mel Blanc quickly improvised a vocal imitation of a sputtering car engine starting up noisily that was so funny it became a regular feature of the show.|$|E

500|$|In 1810 Bishop Asbury visited {{an obscure}} {{part of the}} western country (Kanawha) which was then a wilderness, and pleasantly told the Rev. Thomas S. Hinde that he had visited the region in order that the people might see and know their superintendent; remarking, [...] "The {{shepherd}} ought to know the flock, and the flock the shepherd: they ought to know what man it is that governs them, and I have come nearly one hundred <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my way to see them."

500|$|The station did host some of Baltimore and Ohio's {{most famous}} {{passenger}} trains, including the Capitol Limited to Washington, D.C. [...] Unfortunately, however, the circuitous trackage {{leading to the}} station from the east forced these trains <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{their way through the}} industrial southwest and west side of the city (See map to the left). [...] Other tenants such as the Soo Line Railroad (which purchased the WC in 1909), the M (which became known as the Chicago Great Western Railway in 1893), and the Pere Marquette Railway (which merged into the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1947), were nowhere near the scale of B's operations in the intercity passenger rail market.|$|E
500|$|The next {{objective}} of the forty-fifth was to fight German and Italian forces {{en route to the}} north coast of Sicily. The plan was to use Highway 124, one of Sicily's four major highways. This highway, originally in the American sector, had been usurped by Montgomery, with no word of the change of boundaries given to Middleton. [...] Word eventually came down from Alexander that the boundaries had been changed, which meant that when the forty-fifth reached the highway, they became frozen in place with no opportunity to advance. Middleton, not willing to sit out the remainder of the battle, moved his division from the right of II Corps to the left, traveling ninety <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way through back areas of the other American divisions, to get in position for the march north. [...] On 23 July the first elements of the forty-fifth reached the north coast of the island at Station Cerda, five miles east of Termini Imerese, taking thirteen days to move from south coast to north coast. The division then moved east along the coast, reaching its {{objective of}} Santo Stefano on 30 July. Here they were stormed by the Germans, but fought back, forcing the German rear guard out of the area by the following morning. This was the end of active fighting for the forty-fifth in Sicily, where the division endured 1,156 casualties while taking nearly 11,000 prisoners.|$|E

500|$|It {{was to be}} 1856 {{before the}} {{regiment}} found itself on active service again. [...] In the interim {{there had been a}} short spell in England, a long posting in Gibraltar, several years in Ireland, another six-year tour in the West Indies— where once again fever caused much suffering. [...] These were followed by a short three-year tour in Canada which provided one item of note. On the voyage home two companies, under the command of Captain James Draper, and about 100 women and children were on board the barque Alert when the ship hit a reef about 100 <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Halifax. [...] The ship was refloated but in a heavy sea was at risk of sinking and was taking on water. [...] The master of the Alert decided that the only course of action was to beach the vessel but was worried that the ship was becoming top heavy as the troops and their families made for the upper deck. [...] Captain Draper and the troops were persuaded to remain on the troop deck despite the rising water level. [...] The ship was beached on an uninhabited island and all on board were later rescued. [...] The Duke of Wellington Commander-in-chief of the British army directed that the story of Captain Draper's detachment be read out to every regiment and corps in the army {{as an example of the}} rewards of steadiness and discipline. The two companies were reunited with the rest of the regiment in England, serving in England and Ireland until being posted to India. Based here until 1856 it saw no active service despite being mobilised as part of a Reserve Field Force in Sindh in 1852.|$|E
