30|$|For each {{municipality}} {{a minimum}} {{and a maximum}} OMI value are available and an average value was adopted to perform the economic analysis. The distribution of these average municipal real estate values is shown in Fig.  5 b. The highest OMI values correspond {{to the city of}} Modena and to other smaller municipalities {{in the southern part of}} the study area, whereas the lowest values are found in the rural territory near the Po River in <b>Mantova</b> <b>Province,</b> where buildings are poorly built and therefore highly vulnerable to seismic events (Fig.  3).|$|E
40|$|The {{territory}} on {{the right}} bank of the Po River, along its course {{in the south of}} <b>Mantova</b> <b>province,</b> straddling the Lombardy and Emilia Romagna regions, is characterized by waters and shows the marks of transformations from roman times, followed in the XI century by Benedictine drainage and the works of Consortium of Reclamation during the early Twentieth century. The result is a leveling landscape, a redesign of the irrigation system, the construction of hydraulic buildings, the agricultural settlements have transformed the whole area. The aim to investigate and to understand the landscape as a set, in order to promote the knowledge and dissemination of informations, involving several institutions, has required the identification of a data management tool, for a diachronic reading. The elaborated geographic information system, the survey and investigation of all hydraulic buildings, the guidelines for the protection and enhancement of the landscape are part of a project that sees {{in the creation of a}} Study Center located in the Polirone monastery in San Benedetto Po (MN), an "hub" that can collect data, monitor changes and give directions for the landscape governance at different levels...|$|E
30|$|Losses {{reflect the}} {{vulnerability}} to earthquakes of the urbanized setting. Most {{of the buildings}} were not designed according to any seismic resistance standard because the area was not seismically classified under a national law when the regional administrators noted the suggested national classification proposed in 2003 and applied it to new construction (OPCM 3274 2003). During a long transitional {{period in which the}} new standards were supposed to be introduced, administrators did not enforce the adoption of appropriate technical standards and for this reason the number of residential buildings constructed with appropriate seismic design cannot be easily estimated. The percentage of seismic designed buildings can be assessed only approximately in 66 municipalities previously “not classified” and considered as part of the medium–low seismic risk zone in 2003. On average, the percentage of buildings designed for seismic-resistance in the study area is approximately 4 % {{of the total number of}} existing residential buildings. There are some differences between provinces, which range from 2.5 % for the municipalities of <b>Mantova</b> <b>Province</b> to 6 % for those of Bologna. In theory, these estimated values could be even smaller, because the new release of the national seismic building code (Norme Tecniche per le Costruzioni 2008) was only enforced in the Emilia-Romagna Region after 2009. Late approval of dedicated laws explains the substantial absence of any seismic damage reduction measures applied to the buildings hit by the 2012 earthquake, especially residential houses.|$|E
30|$|The {{resulting}} average monetary losses {{estimated in}} the study area is just higher than 1400 million Euro. At the provincial level, the most significant loss occurred in Modena Province with more than 795 million Euro, followed by the Ferrara and <b>Mantova</b> <b>Provinces</b> with more than 212 and 175 million Euro, and finally, the provinces of Bologna, Reggio Emilia, and Rovigo with 106, 92, and 21 million Euro, respectively. The town that has faced the greatest loss is Mirandola, with an estimated loss of approximately 245 million Euro. Modena and Ferrara, rather far from the epicentral area and thus exposed to a moderate level of shaking, suffered high loss (162 and 148 million Euro) probably due to the large number of damaged buildings combined with their high market value.|$|R
40|$|Since May 16, 2012, a seismic {{sequence}} {{has affected}} the central-southern sector of the Po Plain, in the Modena, Ferrara, Bologna and <b>Mantova</b> <b>provinces</b> (Italy). The first main shock occurred on May 20 (Mw= 5. 9), followed by another two main shocks on May 29 (Mw= 5. 8). The subsurface of the epicenter area is characterized by several active compression north-verging faulted folds of the Apennines (known as "Ferrara Folds"), covered by marine and continental clastic deposits of the Po Plain. The most relevant surface effects caused by the strongest shocks was a 10 - 15 cm uplift of the epicenter area, detected by InSAR interferometry. Soil liquefaction phenomena are widespread and appear to be concentrated along alignments which can be followed for kilometers. At a detailed scale, more than 500 geologic and geomorphologic surface effects have been recorded over an area of about 700 square km. Hydrogeologic anomalies, such as strong water table fluctuations, emission of hot water from ground cracks and water wells have also been recorded all over the area affected...|$|R

It is bordered to the north-east by the Province of Verona, to the east by that of Rovigo, to the south by those of Ferrara, Modena, Reggio Emilia and Parma, to the west by the Province of Cremona and to the north-west by that of Brescia.|$|R
