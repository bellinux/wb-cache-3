25|$|After Shackleford's arrest Chuck Palahniuk {{was asked}} {{to be part of}} the {{decision}} as to whether Shackleford would receive the death sentence. Palahniuk had worked in a hospital and as a crime reporter and struggled with his stance on capital punishment. Over the next few months he began working on Lullaby. According to him it was a way to cope with the decision he had to make regarding Shackleford's death. In the spring of 2001 Shackleford was found guilty for two counts of <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> degree. A month after Palahniuk finished Lullaby, Shackleford was sentenced to death.|$|E

It reports that {{two days later}} on June 17, 1920, Judge William Cant and the grand jury {{had a difficult time}} identifying the lead mob members. In the end the grand jury issued thirty-seven indictments for the lynching mob. Twenty-five were for rioting and twelve for the crime of <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> degree. Some men were indicted on both charges. Three men: Louis Dondino, Carl Hammerberg, and Gilbert Stephenson were convicted of rioting; none served more than 15 months in prison. No one was prosecuted for the murders of the three black men.|$|E
50|$|Others {{questioned}} {{the usefulness of}} the scheme, pointing out that it could not have prevented <b>the</b> Soham <b>murders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> place because <b>the</b> perpetrator, Ian Huntley, knew the victims through his girlfriend, not his job.|$|R

25|$|Frequently {{a critic}} of US and Soviet foreign policy, he resorted to fierce and often {{polarizing}} criticism in pinpointing his resistance towards imperialist ambitions and authoritarian regimes, including those of Francisco Franco of Spain, Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union, António de Oliveira Salazar of Portugal and Gustáv Husák of Czechoslovakia, as well as B J Vorster and P W Botha of South Africa. His 1972 condemnation of the Hanoi bombings, notably comparing the tactic to the Treblinka extermination camp, resulted in a temporary freeze in Sweden–United States relations. His murder by an unapprehended assailant on a street in Stockholm on 28 February 1986 {{was the first of}} its kind in modern Swedish history, and the first assassination of a national leader since Gustav III. It had a great impact across Scandinavia. Local convict and addict Christer Pettersson was convicted of the <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> instance court tingsrätten, but was acquitted on appeal to the Svea hovrätt.|$|E
25|$|The defendants' cases {{took two}} paths. The defendants' lawyers {{obtained}} {{reversal of the}} verdicts by the Arkansas Supreme Court in six of the cases: Ed Ware, Will Wordlow, Albert Giles, Joe Fox, Alf Banks Jr., and John Martin (henceforth Ware et al.) due to a defect in {{the wording of the}} jury verdict. The court ruled that the jury had failed to specify whether the defendants were guilty of <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> or second degree; those cases were accordingly sent back to the lower court for retrial. They were convicted again, but the state supreme court overturned the verdicts, saying that discrimination against black jurors (the juries were all-white) was contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1875. Because the lower court had not acted upon their cases {{for more than two years}} by April 1923, under Arkansas law the defendants were entitled to be released. Jones applied for and gained an order for their release from the Arkansas Supreme Court on June 25, 1923.|$|E
500|$|... "Citizens may resist {{unlawful}} arrest {{to the point}} of taking an arresting officer's life if necessary.” Plummer v. State, 136 Ind. 306 [...] This premise was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case: John Bad Elk v. U.S., 177 U.S. 529. The Court stated: “Where the officer is killed {{in the course of the}} disorder which naturally accompanies an attempted arrest that is resisted, the law looks with very different eyes upon the transaction, when the officer had the right to make the arrest, from what it does if the officer had no right. What may be <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> case might be nothing more than manslaughter in the other, or the facts might show that no offense had been committed." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> main {{characters}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel are miniaturists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire, {{one of whom}} is <b>murdered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> chapter. From this point, Pamuk — in a postmodern style reminiscent of Jorge Luis Borges — plays with the reader and with literary conventions. The novel incorporates metafiction in such ways as making frequent reference to the reader and to the narrators' awareness that they are characters in a book.|$|R

2500|$|The defendants' lawyers {{obtained}} {{reversal of}} the verdicts by the Arkansas Supreme Court in six of the twelve death penalty cases, known as the Ware defendants.

2500|$|A murder, defined broadly, is an {{unlawful}} killing. [...] Unlawful {{killing is}} probably the act most frequently targeted by the criminal law. [...] In many jurisdictions, the crime of murder is divided into various gradations of severity, e.g., <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> degree, based on intent. [...] Malice is a required element of murder. [...] Manslaughter (Culpable Homicide in Scotland) is a lesser variety of killing committed {{in the absence of}} malice, brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. Involuntary manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent, recklessness.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{the police}} and the DA {{particularly}} said in 1998 that JonBenét's brother Burke, who was 9 {{years old at the time}} of her death, was not a suspect. [...] The Ramseys gave several televised interviews, but resisted police questioning except on their own terms. In October 2013, unsealed court documents revealed that a 1999 grand jury had recommended filing charges against John and Patsy for permitting the child to be in a threatening situation and hindering the prosecution of an unidentified person who had [...] "committed ... the crime of <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> degree and child abuse resulting in death". However, the DA determined there was insufficient evidence and did not pursue an indictment. In 2002, the DA's successor took over investigation of the case from {{the police and}} primarily pursued alternative theories of a non-family intruder committing the killing. In 2003, a trace DNA taken from the victim's clothes was found to belong to an unknown male, inducing the DA in 2008 to send the Ramseys a letter of apology declaring the family [...] "completely cleared". In February 2009, the Boulder Police Department took the case back from the DA and reopened the investigation.|$|E
2500|$|The year 1999 {{brought a}} series of great {{personal}} tragedies to Palahniuk's life.

[...] Her former boyfriend, Dale Shackelford, had previously been imprisoned for sexual abuse, and had vowed to kill Fontaine {{as soon as he}} was released from prison. Palahniuk believes that using a personal ad, Fontaine was looking for [...] "the biggest man she could find" [...] to protect her from Shackelford, and Palahniuk's father qualified. After his release, Shackelford followed Fontaine and the senior Palahniuk to Fontaine's home in Kendrick, Idaho after they had gone out for a date. Shackelford then shot them both and dragged their bodies into Fontaine's cabin home, which he then set afire. In the spring of 2001, Shackelford was found guilty for two counts of <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> degree and sentenced to death. In the wake of these events, Palahniuk began working on the novel Lullaby.

50|$|Veiller and Vale's {{play was}} {{significantly}} altered for <b>the</b> film. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> play, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Mrs. Carroll is not <b>murdered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> act but rather lives (off-stage) until the third act. She telephones Sally to warn her that Geoffrey {{is attempting to}} poison her. This provides a major shock to the audience, which {{had no reason to}} suspect Geoffrey. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> screenplay, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Mrs. Carroll dies (off-screen) minutes into the film. Suspense replaces shock, as Sally slowly begins to suspect her husband of murder. William Faulkner worked on an early treatment of the play.|$|R
