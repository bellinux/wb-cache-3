2500|$|Forging {{can produce}} a piece that is {{stronger}} than an equivalent cast or <b>machined</b> <b>part.</b> As the metal is shaped during the forging process, its internal grain deforms to follow the general shape of the part. As a result, the grain is continuous throughout the part, giving rise to a piece with improved strength characteristics. Additionally, forgings can target a lower total cost when compared to a casting or fabrication. When you consider all the costs {{that are involved in}} a product’s lifecycle from procurement to lead time to rework, then factor in the costs of scrap, downtime and further quality issues, the long-term benefits of forgings can outweigh the short-term cost-savings that castings or fabrications might offer.|$|E

The number of <b>machine</b> <b>parts</b> errors were collected from a thermo plastic injection molding machine in a car bumper auto parts manufacturer in Liberec city, Czech Republic from January 2012 to November 2012. A Bayesian method is used for parameter estimation. The results of this study indicate that the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> error correction and {{the amount of time spent}} on the error correction do not improve the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> status of the individual part, but there is a very strong month-to-month dependence of the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> states. Using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion, the performance of the proposed model (MAE = 1. 62) and the HMM including <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> error correction only (MAE = 1. 68), from our previous study, is not significantly different. However, the proposed model has more advantage in the fact that the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> state can be explained by both the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> error correction and the amount of time spent on the error correction...|$|R

5000|$|Snap gauges {{are often}} used when a large {{quantity}} of work pieces must be inspected. The snap gauge has four anvils or jaws, the first one or pair (outermost) are set using the upper limit (tolerance) of the part and the inner set adjusted to the lower limit of the part. A correctly <b>machined</b> <b>part</b> will pass {{the first set of}} jaws and stop at the second [...] - [...] end of test. In this manner, a part may be checked in one action, unlike the plug gauge that needs to be used twice and flipped to access the second gauge.

50|$|Common {{among all}} of the {{different}} specifications and types are the following steps: Prior to passivation, the object must be cleaned of any contaminants and generally must undergo a validating test {{to prove that the}} surface is 'clean.' The object is then placed in an acidic passivating bath that meets the temperature and chemical requirements of the method and type specified between customer and vendor. (Temperatures can range from ambient to 60 degrees C {140 degrees F}), while minimum passivation times are usually 20 to 30 minutes). The parts are neutralized using a bath of aqueous sodium hydroxide, then rinsed with clean water and dried. The passive surface is validated using humidity, elevated temperature, a rusting agent (salt spray), or some combination of the three. However, proprietary passivation processes exist for martensitic stainless steel, which is difficult to passivate, as microscopic discontinuities can form in the surface of a <b>machined</b> <b>part</b> during passivation in a typical nitric acid bath. The passivation process removes exogenous iron, creates/restores a passive oxide layer that prevents further oxidation (rust), and cleans the parts of dirt, scale, or other welding-generated compounds (e.g. oxides).|$|E
5000|$|An unusual form of {{four-stroke}} model {{engine that}} uses {{what is essentially}} a sleeve-valve format, is the British RCV series of [...] "SP" [...] model engines, which use a rotating cylinder liner driven through a bevel gear at the cylinder liner's [...] "bottom" [...] and, even more unusually, have the propeller shaft — as an integrally <b>machined</b> <b>part</b> of the rotating cylinder liner — emerging from what would normally be the cylinder's [...] "top" [...] at the extreme front of the engine, achieving a 2:1 gear reduction ratio compared to the vertically oriented crankshaft's rotational speed. The same firm's [...] "CD" [...] series of model engines use a conventional upright single cylinder with the crankshaft used to spin the propeller directly and also use the rotating cylinder valve. As a parallel with the earlier Charles Knight-designed sleeve-valved automotive powerplants, any RCV sleeve-valved model engine that is run on model glow engine fuel using castor oil (about 2% to 4% content) of the lubricant in the fuel allows the [...] "varnish" [...] created through engine operation to provide a better pneumatic seal between the rotating cylinder valve and the unitized engine cylinder/head castings, initially formed while the engine is being broken in.|$|E
50|$|The {{projector}} magnifies {{the profile}} of the specimen, and displays this on the built-in projection screen. On this screen there is typically a grid that can be rotated 360 degrees so the X-Y axis of the screen can be aligned with a straight edge of the <b>machined</b> <b>part</b> to examine or measure. This projection screen displays {{the profile of}} the specimen and is magnified for better ease of calculating linear measurements.An edge of the specimen to examine may be lined up with the grid on the screen. From there, simple measurements may be taken for distances to other points. This is being done on a magnified profile of the specimen. It can be simpler as well as reduce errors by measuring on the magnified projection screen of a profile projector. The typical method for lighting is by diascopic illumination, which is lighting from behind. This type of lighting is also called transmitted illumination when the specimen is translucent and light can pass through it. If the specimen is opaque, then the light will not go through it, but will form a profile of the specimen. Measuring of the sample can be done on the projection screen. A profile projector may also have episcopic illumination (which is light shining from above). This useful in displaying bores or internal areas that may need to be measured.|$|E

5000|$|A {{machine shop}} {{typically}} has a storage area containing a large variety of bar stock. To create a metal component, {{a bar of}} sufficient volume is selected from storage and brought to the machining area. This piece may then be sawed, milled, drilled, turned, or ground to remove material and create the final shape. In turning, for large-diameter work (typically more than 100 mm, {{although there is no}} universal threshold), a piece of the bar is cut off using a horizontal bandsaw to create a blank for each part. The blanks are then fed into a chucking lathe (chucker) which chucks each one in turn. For smaller-diameter work, the entire length of bar stock is more often fed through the spindle of the lathe. The entire bar rotates with the spindle during the part-machining cycle. When the cycle ends and one part is done, the chuck opens, the bar is pulled or pushed forward ("fed") by any of various automatic means, the chuck closes, and the next cycle begins. The last step of the cycle is to cut off the <b>machined</b> <b>part</b> from the bar, which is called [...] "parting it off" [...] and is achieved with a [...] "cutoff" [...] or [...] "part-off" [...] tool, a tool bit that grooves the bar {{all the way down to}} the centreline, causing the part to fall off. Then the cycle repeats.|$|E
5000|$|World War II saw new {{production}} of the Springfield at private manufacturers Remington Arms and Smith-Corona Typewriter. Remington began {{production of the}} M1903 in September 1941, at serial number 3,000,000, using old tooling from the Rock Island Arsenal which had been in storage since 1919. The very early rifles are almost indistinguishable from 1919-made Rock Island rifles. As the already worn tooling began to wear beyond use Remington began seeking Army approval for a continuously increasing number of changes and simplifications to both speed up manufacture and improve performance. The milled parts on the Remington M1903 were gradually replaced with stamped parts until, at about serial number 3,330,000, the Army and Remington recognized that a new model name was appropriate. Other features of the M1903, such as high-grade walnut stocks with finger grooves, were replaced with less expensive but serviceable substitutes. Most milled parts made by Remington were marked with an [...] "R". M1903 production was discontinued {{in favor of the}} M1903A3. The most noticeable visual difference in the M1903A3 was the replacement of the barrel-mounted rear sight with a smaller, simpler aperture rear sight mounted on the rear of the receiver; it was primarily adopted in order to speed familiarization by soldiers already trained on the M1 Garand, which had a similar sighting system. However, the leaf spring providing tension to the elevation adjustment on the new aperture sight tended to weaken with continued use over time, causing the rifle to lose its preset range elevation setting. Other modifications included a new stamped cartridge follower; ironically, the rounded edges of the new design largely alleviated the 'fourth-round jam' complaints of the earlier <b>machined</b> <b>part.</b> All stock furniture was also redesigned in stamped metal.|$|E
