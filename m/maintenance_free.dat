[...] Maintenance of green roofs often includes fertilization to increase flowering and succulent plant cover. [...] If aesthetics are not an issue, fertilization and maintenance are generally not needed. [...] Extensive green roofs should only be fertilized with controlled-release fertilizers {{in order to avoid}} pollution of the storm water. [...] Conventional fertilizers should never be used on extensive vegetated roofs. [...] German studies have approximated the nutrient requirement of vegetated roofs to 5gN/m2. [...] It is also important to use a substrate that does not contain too many available nutrients. [...] The FLL guidelines specify maximum-allowable nutrient content of substrates.|$|E
2500|$|The Reverse Osmosis {{process is}} not <b>maintenance</b> <b>free.</b> Various factors {{interfere}} with efficiency: ionic contamination (calcium, magnesium etc.); DOC; bacteria; viruses; colloids & insoluble particulates; biofouling and scaling. In extreme cases destroying the RO membranes. To mitigate damage, various pretreatment stages are introduced. [...] Anti-scaling inhibitors include acids and other agents like the organic polymers Polyacrylamide and Polymaleic Acid), Phosphonates and Polyphosphates. Inhibitors for fouling are biocides (as oxidants against bacteria and viruses), like chlorine, ozone, sodium or calcium hypochlorite. At regular intervals, depending on the membrane contamination; fluctuating seawater conditions; or prompted by monitoring processes the membranes need to be cleaned, known as emergency or shock-flushing. Flushing is done with inhibitors in a fresh water solution. Thus the system needs to go offline. This procedure is environmental risky, since contaminated water is rejected into the ocean without treatment. Sensitive marine habitats can be irreversibly damaged.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Rubber {{suspension}} {{system is a}} new {{suspension system}} in which rubber is {{used to be the}} elastic element, thus rubber spring {{is one of the key}} components of suspension. Based on its concrete structure, a finite element model of rubber spring is made and so as to analyze the rubber suspension forces under different working conditions, to analyze the strength and stiffness for providing a reference for the design. The introduction Suspension system is the floorboard of all force connection devices of car frame and axle or wheels, its function is to transfer the force and moment between the wheels and the frame, to amortize the impact caused by uneven road surface to the frame or the car and attenuate the vibration to make sure the car goes smoothly[1]. Rubber suspension becomes popular in recent years, which has the advantage of simple structure, easy installation, light weight, <b>free</b> <b>maintenance,</b> lubrication <b>free,</b> favorable possibility and comfort. It can greatly reduce the vibration caused by uneven road, reduce the driver’s fatigue, protect the vehicle parts and the integrity of the goods and extend the lifespan of the parts equipped on the vehicle[2]. A reasonable layout, advanced structure rubber suspension can greatly improve the performanc...|$|R
