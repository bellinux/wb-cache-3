5000|$|The <b>motor</b> <b>grader</b> line {{received}} the first power-shift transmission, {{which was a}} big leap forward, in 1955. Called the Galion Grade-O-Matic drive, it utilized a torque converter, output shaft governor and power-shift transmission, providing simple two-lever control of speed and direction. The Galion T-700 garnered the world's largest grader title in 1955. Larger {{than anything else in}} the grader industry, it boasted [...] and an operating weight of over 40,000 pounds.|$|E
50|$|In 1922, Galion {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{companies}} to develop a self-propelled <b>motor</b> <b>grader.</b> The tractor engine and transmission were located in the rear of the frame, and the operator cockpit was located near the center of the machine. Also in the 1920s, development work began on one of Galion's greatest achievements- the Galion hydraulic control.

5000|$|A grader, also {{commonly}} referred to as a road grader or a <b>motor</b> <b>grader,</b> is a construction machine with a long blade used to create a flat surface during the grading process. Typical models have three axles, with the engine and cab situated above the rear axles {{at one end of the}} vehicle and a third axle at the front end of the vehicle, with the blade in between. In certain countries, for example in Finland, almost every grader is equipped with a second blade that is placed in front of the front axle. Some construction personnel refer to the entire machine as [...] "the blade". Capacities range from a blade width of 2.50 to 7.30 m and engines from 93-373 kW (125-500 hp). Certain graders can operate multiple attachments, or be used for separate tasks like underground mining.|$|E

50|$|Road rollers use {{the weight}} of the vehicle to {{compress}} the surface being rolled (static) or use mechanical advantage (vibrating). Initial compaction of the substrate on a road project is done using a padfoot drum roller, which achieves higher compaction density due to the pads having less surface area. On large freeways a four wheel compactor with padfoot drum and a blade, such as a Caterpillar 815/825 series machine, would be used due to its high weight, speed and the powerful pushing force to spread bulk material. On regional roads a smaller single padfoot drum machine may be used. The next machine is usually a single smooth drum compactor that compacts the high spots down until the soil is smooth, and this is usually done in combination with a <b>motor</b> <b>grader</b> to get a level surface. Sometimes at this stage a pneumatic tyre roller would be used. These rollers feature two rows (front and back) of pneumatic tyres that overlap, and the flexibility of the tyres provides a kneading action that seals the surface and with some vertical movement of the wheels, enables the roller to operate effectively on uneven ground. Once the soil base is flat the pad drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface. The next course (road base) would be compacted using a smooth single drum, smooth tandem roller or pneumatic tyre roller in combination with a grader, and a water truck to achieve the desired flat surface with the right moisture content for optimum compaction. Once the road base is compacted, the smooth single drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface (There is however an exception, if the single drum has special flat-wide-base tyres on the machine). The final wear course of asphalt concrete (a.k.a. asphalt or blacktop in North America, or macadam in England) is laid using a paver and compacted using a tandem smooth drum roller, a three-point roller or a pneumatic tyre roller. Three point rollers on asphalt were very common once and are still used, but tandem vibrating rollers are the usual choice now, with the pneumatic tyre roller's kneading action being the last roller to seal off the surface.|$|E

40|$|To {{improve the}} fuel {{consumption}} of a <b>motor</b> <b>grader,</b> {{a method for}} shifting the power curve of the grader engine is proposed. The working principle, calculation method, and design procedure of the novel method are depicted. Considering the nonlinear and time-varying uncertainty of the load of a <b>motor</b> <b>grader,</b> the fuzzy adaptive control is provided to shift the power curve. The shifting action is decided by the gears and the corresponding engine speed together with the displacements of both the hydraulic pump and motor. As a result, the power line adapts to the frequent changes in different external loads. A prototype <b>motor</b> <b>grader</b> is developed to test the above-mentioned energy conservation method in different working conditions. The {{results show that the}} fuel consumption of the prototype motor is reduced by 23 %– 34 % and the skip ratio is decreased by 10 % compared with the traditional grader with only one power curve. The proposed shifting power curve method can be widely applied to other heavy-load construction machinery also...|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{programming}} is an optimization technique used in solving problems that exhibit {{the characteristics of}} overlapping sub-problems and optimal substructure. Optimal substructure indicates that optimal solutions of sub-problems {{can lead to the}} optimal solution of the overall problem. Machinery replacement problems exhibit such properties and therefore can be solved by dynamic programming technique. The technique is simple in application and produces definite solutions to machinery replacement problems. It has this advantage over other optimization techniques like the cumbersome forward/backward algorithm which may produce infinite solutions. This paper demonstrates the use of dynamic programming technique in solving machinery replacement problems of a hypothetical front-end loader and an identified <b>Motor</b> <b>Grader.</b> The choice of hypothetical and measured cost data from the construction industry is deliberate. The focus here is on the versatility of the dynamic programming technique in handling such data from the same industry. It can also be extended to other industries. The result reveals the simplicity and efficiency of dynamic programming technique in solving machinery replacement problems. It also shows the difference between hypothetical and measured data. There is also an indication that the <b>Motor</b> <b>Grader</b> has an appreciable secondhand value. The dynamic programming technique is therefore a good tool for industry managers in making machinery replacement decision...|$|E

40|$|Approximately {{ten million}} tons of waste {{bituminous}} roofing are torn off annually in the United States. This volume {{is a major factor}} in the rapid filling of landfills. In 1995, Benton County, Iowa initiated a program to cost effectively recycle torn off waste shingles. Nine hundred tons of waste shingles were ground using a Maxigrind. A magnetic roller on the discharge conveyor removed most of the nails. Five hundred tons of the ground waste shingles were blade mixed into 0. 6 km (0. 4 mi) of a crushed stone granular surfaced Benton County rural secondary roadway. A magnet attached to the <b>motor</b> <b>grader</b> removed another 1 / 3 kg (3 / 4 lb) of nails during the spreading and mixing operation on the 0. 6 km (0. 4 mi) section of roadway.

50|$|The {{origins of}} the Haulpak line began with the {{purchase}} of R. G. LeTourneau's construction machinery business in 1953 by Westinghouse Air Brake Company. Wabco had traditionally been a manufacturer of railway air brake systems, but ventured into construction machinery with the purchase of LeRoi air tools and industrial drills in 1952. The subsequent purchase of R. G. LeTourneau's construction machinery line gave Wabco a comprehensive range of machinery including scrapers, rubber-tyred dozers and other attachments. Wabco subsequently added <b>motor</b> <b>graders</b> to their product line by purchasing J.D. Adams in 1955 and thereafter front end loaders, with the purchase of Scoopmobile. Wabco recognised {{the importance of the}} off-highway Truck market and hired Ralph H. Kress to design a line of haul trucks in-house. Kress incorporated many new design features which were trend setting and eventually Caterpillar was to offer him a position designing their range of haulers.|$|R
