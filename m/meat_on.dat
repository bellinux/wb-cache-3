5|$|Meats {{were more}} {{expensive}} than plant foods. Though rich in protein, the calorie-to-weight ratio of meat was {{less than that of}} plant food. Meat could be up to four times as expensive as bread. Fish was up to 16 times as costly, and was expensive even for coastal populations. This meant that fasts could mean an especially meager diet for those who could not afford alternatives to meat and animal products like milk and eggs. It was only after the Black Death had eradicated up to half of the European population that meat became more common even for poorer people. The drastic reduction in many populated areas resulted in a labor shortage, meaning that wages dramatically increased. It also left vast areas of farmland untended, making them available for pasture and putting more <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> the market.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} human health {{concerns}} {{associated with the}} consumption of dolphin meat in Japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of methylmercury. There are no known cases of mercury poisoning {{as a result of}} consuming dolphin meat, though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high. The Japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> a regular basis. Similar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin meat in the Faroe Islands, where prenatal exposure to methylmercury and PCBs primarily from the consumption of pilot whale meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} prison cells {{are found in}} the Castellania. The cells close to the court rooms hosted new cases and also those {{awaiting}} execution. Several other cells are located {{at the rear of the}} building, and they are surrounded by a courtyard. These cells generally housed inmates who had to serve a short sentence of less than eight days, usually due to unpaid rent or accumulated debts. Other convicts were those who refused to bake bread in Valletta which were jailed for a roughly a week and those found guilty of stealing to eat which were imprisoned up to three months. In some cases, individuals were imprisoned for not observing religious norms, such as eating <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> prohibited days. Prisoners with longer sentences were usually sent to other prisons, usually the Gran Prigione, and if in physical capability were subject to be sent to the galleys. Medical physicians were requested to visit the inmates in the prison when needed for multiple reasons related to their health and examinations. There were attempts to re-criminalize gambling during the late magistracy of Pinto as such activity led to undesirable financial consequences to participants but the widespread practice was instead strictly regulated, on fears that if banned it may be of benefit to the underground community.|$|E
5|$|Red {{follows a}} {{familiar}} scent and is reunited with her sister, {{a single mother}} with three chicks. The two hunt together and bring food back to the nest for the young. A white pterosaur, one Red has seen since she hatched, helps the two by finding carrion and prey {{in exchange for a}} helping of <b>meat.</b> <b>On</b> one hunting expedition, when the two adult Utahraptor are stalking a herd of Iguanodon, Red spies a young male Utahraptor that is watching their prey. He begins a courtship dance for Red, but Red's sister chases him off, hissing. Her growls agitate the Iguanodon, who stampede; the male hastily leaves. After climbing into a tree to escape a flash flood, Red encounters the male raptor again, who performs a courtship dance while hanging onto the tree branches. Red's sister begrudgingly allows the male to stay with them, provided he steers clear of her chicks.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of urban areasin particular Antananarivohave been {{hardest hit by}} economic downturns and economic policy shifts. The national economic crisis in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and the World Bank's imposition of a structural adjustment program lowered living standards for the average resident of the city. The end of state subsidies, rapid inflation, higher taxes, widespread impoverishment {{and the decline of}} the middle class were especially evident in Antananarivo, as was the growing wealth of a tiny political and economic elite in the city. In 2007, two thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity, while ten percent of households owned a scooter, car or other motor vehicle. Running water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes, small restaurants and businesses in 2007, necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps and the use of outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building. In 2007, 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines. Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen. The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food. Owing to its increasingly high cost, consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s; the urban poor eat <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> holidays only once or twice a year.|$|E

25|$|The long-standing Roman Catholic {{tradition}} of not eating <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> Fridays, especially during Lent, and of substituting fish for <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> that day continues to influence habits even in predominantly Protestant, Anglican, semi-secular and secular societies.

25|$|According to Canon Law, Roman Catholics are {{required}} to abstain from meat (defined as all animal flesh excluding water animals) on Ash Wednesday and all Fridays of Lent including Good Friday. Canon Law also obliges Catholics to abstain from <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> the Fridays of the year outside of Lent (excluding certain holy days) unless, {{with the permission of}} the local conference of bishops, another penitential act is substituted. The restrictions on eating <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> these days is solely as an act of penance and not because of a religious objection to eating meat.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of his {{involvement}} with the Board of Trustees of Georgia, Hales learnt of the problems resulting from overcrowding of ships and this spurred him to invent a ship ventilator and undertake experiments to distil fresh water from sea water and to use salt to preserve <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> board ship.|$|E

40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{microbial}} contamination of <b>meat</b> carcasses <b>on</b> display on wooden tables {{over a period}} of 90 minutes at the Bodija meat market was studied. This is to understudy the role of <b>meat</b> display methods <b>on</b> <b>meat</b> contamination. Swab samples were taken from four wooden meat display tables and <b>meat</b> carcasses <b>on</b> them at intervals of 30 minutes for a period of 1 hour 30 minutes and cultured on nutrient agar and Macconkey agar to determine the total aerobic counts (TAC) and coliform counts (TCC) over time. The result showed that the mean log TAC and TCC increased significantly (P< 0. 05) <b>on</b> the wooden <b>meat</b> display tables by 0. 11 and 0. 30 log CFU/cm 2 respectively and <b>on</b> the <b>meat</b> carcasses by 0. 29 log CFU/cm 2 each over the 1 hour 30 minutes period. There is a direct relationship (r = + 1) in the pattern of microbial growth (TAC and TCC) <b>on</b> the wooden <b>meat</b> display tables and <b>meat</b> carcasses <b>on</b> display with time. This is suggestive of a common extraneous source of contamination of both the meat display tables and <b>meat</b> displayed <b>on</b> them. It is therefore recommended that meat carcasses should be hygienically displayed by preventing direct exposure to air and other environmental conditions so as to minimize contamination...|$|R
