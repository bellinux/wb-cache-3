25|$|Shafi'i: The Shafi'i {{school has}} had two {{well-known}} positions on this issue. The first view is that covering of the face is not obligatory (fard).

A righteous <b>man</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> set himself up to mock and scoff at others.

25|$|Scholars cite {{integrity}} and equality as masculine values in male-male relationships and virility in male-female relationships. Legends of ancient heroes include the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Iliad and the Odyssey. The stories demonstrate qualities in the hero which inspire respect, such as wisdom and courage: knowing things other <b>men</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know and taking risks other men would not dare.|$|E
25|$|Trichomoniasis (trich) is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. About 70% of women and <b>men</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have symptoms when infected. When symptoms do occur they typically begin 5 to 28 days after exposure. Symptoms can include itching in the genital area, a bad smelling thin vaginal discharge, burning with urination, and pain with sex. Having trichomoniasis {{increases the risk of}} getting HIV/AIDS. It may also cause complications during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The Bible {{has many}} rituals of {{purification}} relating to menstruation, childbirth, sexual relations, nocturnal emission, unusual bodily fluids, skin disease, death, and animal sacrifices. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church prescribes {{several kinds of}} hand washing for example after leaving the latrine, lavatory or bathhouse, or before prayer, or after eating a meal. The women in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church are prohibited from entering the church temple during menses; and the <b>men</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> enter a church the day after they have had intercourse with their wives.|$|E

25|$|The Eastern Orthodox Church {{does not}} {{consider}} the age of Church Fathers to be over and includes later influential writers {{up to the present}} day. The Orthodox view is that <b>men</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have to agree on every detail, much less be infallible, to be considered Church Fathers. Rather, Orthodox doctrine is determined by the consensus of the Holy Fathers—those points on which they do agree. This consensus guides the church in questions of dogma, the correct interpretation of scripture, and to distinguish the authentic sacred tradition of the Church from false teachings.|$|E

It {{is famous for}} its annual {{carnival}} which starts with the arrival of Vaval (the Carnival King) on the first Sunday after New Year's Day and continues with very popular all-night costume balls and Sunday afternoon parades every weekend until Mardi Gras. Carnaval dances include mazurka, biguine and piké djouk.

25|$|Women took {{offense to}} the fact that their {{designated}} parking spots were made larger because they thought it implied that women were bad drivers. Men also took offense to this because women get special treatment while <b>men</b> <b>do</b> <b>not.</b> The men did not understand why larger parking spaces were made for inexperienced female drivers, but none for inexperienced male drivers considering women and men both have to take the same exam to receive a drivers license. They felt this went against gender equality. Another issue arose when a town in Germany labeled two parking spots as reserved for men based on the sole fact that they were harder to maneuver into further backing up the claims that women were being discriminated against for their driving skills.|$|E
25|$|In the Latin Church, only celibate men, as a rule, are ordained as priests, {{while the}} Eastern Churches, {{again as a}} rule, ordain both celibate and married men. Among the Eastern {{particular}} Churches, the Ethiopic Catholic Church ordains only celibate clergy, while also having married priests who were ordained in the Orthodox Church, while other Eastern Catholic Churches, which do ordain married <b>men,</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have married priests in certain countries. The Western or Latin Church does sometimes, though rarely, ordain married men, usually Protestant clergy who have become Catholics. All sui iuris Churches of the Catholic Church maintain the ancient tradition that, following ordination, marriage is not allowed. Even a married priest whose wife dies may not then marry again.|$|E

Sam reveals that while he left Donna to get married, he did not go through with it, but returned to find Donna with another man. The <b>men</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> want paternity confirmed, agreeing to be one-third of a father for Sophie. She tells Sky they should postpone their wedding and travel the world. Sam proposes to Donna. She accepts and they are married. At the reception, Sam sings to Donna, Rosie makes a play for Bill and Harry openly admits he is gay. The couples proclaim their love.

25|$|Perceptions of wage {{entitlement}} differ {{between women}} and men such that men are more likely to feel worthy of higher pay while women's sense of wage entitlement is depressed. Women's beliefs about their relatively lower worth and their depressed wage entitlement reflects their lower social status such that when women's status is raised, their wage entitlement raises as well. However, gender-related status manipulation has no impact on men's elevated wage entitlement. Even when men's status is lowered on a specific task (e.g., by telling them that women typically outperform men on this task), <b>men</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> reduce their self-pay and respond with elevated projections of their own competence. The usual pattern whereby men assign themselves more pay than women for comparable work might explain why men tend to initiate negotiations more than women.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} of cooking in early Homo may have created problems of food theft from women while food was being cooked. As a result, females would recruit male partners {{to protect them}} and their resources from others. This concept, known as the theft hypothesis, accommodates an explanation {{as to why the}} labor of cooking is strongly associated with the status of women. Women are forced to gather and cook foods because they will not acquire food otherwise and access to resources is critical for their reproductive success. On the contrary, <b>men</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> gather because their physical dominance allows them to scrounge cooked foods from women. Thus, women's foraging and food preparation efforts allow men to participate in the high-risk, high-reward activities of hunting. Females, in turn, become increasingly sexually attractive as a means to exploit male interest in investing in her protection.|$|E
25|$|Coincidentally Anytus appears, whom Socrates praises {{as the son}} of Anthemion, {{who earned}} his fortune with {{intelligence}} and hard work. He says that Anthemion had his son well-educated and so Anytus is well-suited to join the investigation. Socrates suggests that the sophists are teachers of virtue. Anytus is horrified, saying that he neither knows any, nor cares to know any. Socrates then questions why it is that <b>men</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> always produce sons of the same virtue as themselves. He alludes to other notable male figures, such as Themistocles, Aristides, Pericles and Thucydides, and casts doubt on whether these men produced sons as capable of virtue as themselves. Anytus becomes offended and accuses Socrates of slander, warning him to be careful expressing such opinions. (The historical Anytus was one of Socrates' accusers in his trial.) Socrates suggests that Anytus does not realize what slander is, and continues his dialogue with Meno as to the definition of virtue.|$|E

25|$|In {{the months}} and years {{following}} the appearance of pubic hair, other areas of skin that respond to androgens may develop androgenic hair. The usual sequence is: underarm (axillary) hair, perianal hair, upper lip hair, sideburn (preauricular) hair, periareolar hair, and the beard area. As with most human biological processes, this specific order may vary among some individuals. Arm, leg, chest, abdominal, and back hair become heavier more gradually. There is a large range in amount of body hair among adult men, and significant differences in timing and quantity of hair growth among different racial groups. Facial hair is often present in late adolescence, but may not appear until significantly later. Facial hair will continue to get coarser, darker and thicker for another 2–4 years after puberty. Some <b>men</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> develop full facial hair for up to 10 years {{after the completion of}} puberty. Chest hair may appear during puberty or years after, though not all men develop it.|$|E
25|$|Facial hair {{in males}} {{normally}} {{appears in a}} specific order during puberty: The first facial hair to appear tends to grow {{at the corners of}} the upper lip, typically between 14 and 17 years of age. It then spreads to form a moustache over the entire upper lip. This is followed by the appearance of hair on {{the upper part of the}} cheeks, and the area under the lower lip. The hair eventually spreads to the sides and lower border of the chin, and the rest of the lower face to form a full beard. As with most human biological processes, this specific order may vary among some individuals. Facial hair is often present in late adolescence, around ages 17 and 18, but may not appear until significantly later. Some <b>men</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> develop full facial hair for 10 years after puberty. Facial hair continues to get coarser, darker and thicker for another 2–4 years after puberty.|$|E
25|$|While the SAF was {{concerned}} {{of the safety}} of out gay and trans men living and working with straight servicemen it was also reluctant to exempt them from the compulsory National Service that all Singaporean men had to perform. However, post-operative male-to-female transsexuals were exempted from National Service as the Singapore Government recognised their new gender identity as women. It is unknown if post-operative female-to-male transsexuals perform National Service, though {{it is unlikely that}} many of them exist who have undergone their operation by the time of enlistment, around the age of 18. In any case, most homosexuals did (and do) not declare their sexual orientation during this examination and go on to serve in all variety of vocations. Gay <b>men</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> come out for many reasons, the most common being that they are not comfortable with declaring their sexuality to a State and organisation that is perceived to be homophobic. Some gay men also refrain from coming out as they wish to perform their duties alongside others, and find the segregation of homosexuals offensive.|$|E
