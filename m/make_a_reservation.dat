500|$|One {{complaint}} {{many customers}} have with Schwa {{is that it}} is exceedingly difficult to get a reservation. GQ magazine describes a typical customer as having spent weeks trying to get past the always full answering machine that serves as Schwa's primary reservation system. [...] The restaurant attracts an estimated 60 requests for its 26 seats each day, and is notoriously slow at returning phone calls. One couple got so frustrated with the system that they drove down to the restaurant to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>reservation</b> in person. Upon arrival, they were told they had to call it in. Despite their frustration, the couple kept trying and when they finally got in they remarked, [...] "You know what? It was worth it." [...] According to Carlson, most customers' first comment when they arrive at Schwa is either to complain about how difficult it was to get a reservation or to ask for another one. Schwa will not seat customers without a reservation, even if the restaurant is empty.|$|E

Most courts will enforce a so-called click wrap covenant when <b>an</b> individual <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>reservation</b> or purchase on the company website. In the click wrap procedure, <b>a</b> <b>reservation</b> cannot be completed until the customer clicks the “agree ” button to the terms and conditions of sale. However, most hotel websites use a slightly different approach, known as “browse wrap, ” in which the terms and conditions are available on the site but the reservation can be completed without the cus-tomer’s express assent. The terms and conditions usu-ally dictate the controlling legal jurisdiction or mandate arbitration for disagreements, and thus it is in the hotel company’s interest to demonstrate that would-be guests have read and definitively agreed to those terms and conditions...|$|R
