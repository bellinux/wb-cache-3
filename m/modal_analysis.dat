25|$|When {{there are}} many degrees of freedom, one method of {{visualizing}} the mode shapes is by animating them using structural analysis software such as Femap or ANSYS.

In this case, the finite element method was used to generate an approximation of the mass and stiffness matrices by meshing the object of interest in order to solve a discrete eigenvalue problem. Note that, in this case, the finite element method provides an approximation of the meshed surface (for which there exists an infinite number of vibration modes and frequencies). Therefore, this relatively simple model that has over 100 degrees of freedom and hence as many natural frequencies and mode shapes, provides a good approximation for the first natural frequencies and modes. Generally, only the first few modes are important for practical applications.|$|E

Similarly the pipe poiseuille flow is predicted, by modal stability theory, to be stable at any Re but becomes unstable around Re= 2000. It was generally accepted that neglecting the nonlinearities in the sta-bility equations is reason for this discrepancy. But recently using Non-modal stability the transient behavior of perturbations has been studied by various peo-ple, i. e. the nature of growth of energy of perturbation at very short times. If the energy of perturbations grow at short times, it gives rise to the possibility for nonlinearities to kick in and cause the instability in the fluid flow.
