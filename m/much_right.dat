500|$|The troops under Patton's command {{received}} the speech well. The general's strong reputation caused considerable excitement among his men, and they listened intently, in absolute silence, as he spoke. A majority indicated they enjoyed Patton's speaking style. As one officer recounted {{of the end}} of the speech, [...] "The men instinctively sensed the fact and the telling mark that they themselves would play in world history because of it, for they were being told as <b>much</b> <b>right</b> now. Deep sincerity and seriousness lay behind the General's colorful words, and the men well knew it, but they loved the way he put it as only he could do it." [...] Patton gave a humorous tone to the speech, as he intentionally sought to make his men laugh with his colorful delivery. Observers later noted the troops seemed to find the speeches very funny. In particular, Patton's use of obscene humor was well received by the enlisted men, as it was [...] "the language of the barracks".|$|E

500|$|Robinson {{was also}} derided by {{opposing}} teams. Some, notably the St. Louis Cardinals, threatened to strike if Robinson played, {{but also to}} spread the walkout across the entire National League. Existence of the plot was leaked by the Cardinals' team physician, Robert Hyland, to a friend, the New York Herald Tribunes Rutherford [...] "Rud" [...] Rennie. The reporter, concerned about protecting Hyland's anonymity and job, in turn leaked it to his Tribune colleague and editor, Stanley Woodward, whose own subsequent reporting with other sources protected Hyland. The Woodward article made national headlines. After the threat was exposed, National League President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler {{let it be known}} that any striking players would be suspended. [...] "You will find that the friends that you think you have in the press box will not support you, that you will be outcasts," [...] threatened Chandler. [...] "I do not care if half the league strikes. Those who do it will encounter quick retribution. All will be suspended and I don't care if it wrecks the National League for five years. This is the United States of America and one citizen has as <b>much</b> <b>right</b> to play as another." [...] Woodward's article received the E. P. Dutton Award in 1947 for Best Sports Reporting. New York Times columnist Red Smith turned to the Cardinals' 1947 racial strike in 1977, as a spate of commemorative articles appeared on the 30th anniversary of Robinson's signing with the Dodgers. Smith remembered his old Herald Tribune colleagues' part in exposing the players' strike conspiracy. It would have succeeded, wrote Smith, [...] "…if Rud Rennie and Stanley Woodward hadn't exposed their intentions in the New York Herald Tribune." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time Adorno struck up {{relationships}} with contemporary German-language poets such as Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann. Adorno's 1949 dictum—"To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric"—posed {{the question of what}} German culture could mean after Auschwitz; his own continual revision of this dictum—in Negative Dialectics, for example, he wrote that [...] "Perennial suffering has as <b>much</b> <b>right</b> to expression as a tortured man has to scream"; [...] while in [...] "Commitment," [...] he wrote in 1962 that the dictum [...] "expresses in negative form the impulse which inspires committed literature"—was part of post-war Germany's struggle with history and culture. Adorno additionally befriended the writer and poet Hans Magnus Enzensberger as well as the film-maker Alexander Kluge.|$|E

The result of this meeting was an agreement that seven men, including Peck and Captain Ian Martin, commanding a four-man Royal Marines detachment, should be exchanged for the hostages aboard the aircraft. The 26 passengers were then allowed to disembark and sent to lodge with local families, as the island had no hotel.

He said that he still felt Brawley had a good case to go to trial, saying in an interview: [...] "I disagreed with the grand jury on Brawley. I believed there was enough evidence to go to trial.

This included a major exhibition of Yorkshire artists. Paraskos also founded a Yorkshire Studies degree course at Hull University.

2500|$|Some reviewers {{were more}} {{critical}} of the game. The reviewer for Computer Gaming World said that [...] "There's nothing really wrong with Outlaws.

Edge magazine's reviewer stated that [...] "not for the first time, shown that it's not infallible." [...] Charlie Brooker of PC Zone (UK) had {{to take time to}} warm up to the game. [...] "when you start playing Outlaws, it feels downright cruddy." [...] Brooker stated that after a lengthy amount of play his opinion changed, and ultimately he gave the game a favorable review.|$|E

It is a very much more difficult task to feed the nation than it is to wreck it". Baldwin wrote, [...] "The general strike is a challenge to the parliament and is the road to anarchy". The British Worker, the TUC's newspaper, wrote: [...] "We are not making war on the people.

2500|$|Supposedly, Kelly {{was not in}} {{the game}} when an {{opposing}} batter hit a foul fly. Seeing that catcher Charley Ganzel could not catch the ball, Kelly announced himself in and made the play. The story would have most likely been from 1889, 1891 or 1892, when Ganzel and Kelly were teammates. Bennett said, [...] "During a game one day, [...] sat on the bench and Ganzel was behind the bat [...] A foul fly was popped up, out of Ganzel's reach, when quick as a flash `Kel’ ran forward, ordered Ganzel out of the game, caught the ball, and then ordered the umpire to declare the batter out.

2500|$|The Regency Crisis of 1788–89 {{led to an}} {{outbreak}} of support for Pitt in Yorkshire {{in the aftermath of}} Fox's assertion that the Prince of Wales had as <b>much</b> <b>right</b> to the throne during the King's illness as if he had inherited it. Zouch countered Fitzwilliam's proposal for a popular address in favour of the Prince of Wales' hereditary right: [...] " [...] very hazardous experiment". Fitzwilliam opened the debate in the Lords on 15 December 1788, claiming that the Prince's right was [...] "a question which...could not be brought under discussion without producing effects which every well-meaning and considerate individual must wish to avoid". In January 1789 when the Commons' resolutions in favour of a Regency Bill (which would restrict the Prince of Wales' regal authority) came up to the Lords, Fitzwilliam said they would [...] "reduce the constitution from the principles of a limited monarchy, and change it to the principles of a republic". He criticised Lord Camden's proposal that the Regent could create new peers only if the two Houses of Parliament consented: [...] " [...] in the highest degree unconstitutional, and he should, in consequence, think it his indispensable duty to come forward with a declaration condemning all such doctrines as repugnant to the principles of the British constitution". If the Duke of Portland had formed an administration upon the Prince of Wales becoming Regent, Fitzwilliam would have been First Lord of the Admiralty, although Fitzwilliam was relieved when the King recovered from his illness and prospects of assuming this office subsequently disappeared.|$|E
2500|$|Harras also commented, [...] "As soon as I saw {{the sketch}} by Walter [...] and heard Louise's take on him, I {{knew we had}} the {{character}} I wanted. Jackson [...] redrew the page, patching in the shadowy Apocalypse where the Owl had been. But the genesis was clearly Walt and Weezie's." [...] Guice admitted to difficulty recalling the details behind redrawing the last page of issue #5: [...] "The best I can remember now is putting his look together pretty <b>much</b> <b>right</b> on the pencil page—just adding bits of costuming business which hinted toward his true appearance when we'd eventually see him in full reveal. I don't believe {{there was even a}} character sketch done for him at that point—I planned on making sense of it all later on, but by then I was gone and others had that concern." [...] Apocalypse's silhouette in issue #5 does not match up with his full appearance in issue #6, suggesting the possibility that Guice was using Simonson's sketch as a reference for issue #6 but did not have access to it earlier, necessitating that he come up with his own design for issue #5. Walter Simonson himself has downplayed his role in the character's creation, saying that Guice was responsible for creating the design and that he, Simonson, merely modified it later: [...] "I did not co-create Apocalypse. However, I wish I had. Louise Simonson and Jackson Guice created him. He appeared in a few panels {{at the end of one}} of Jackson’s last X-FACTORs, so I am the first artist to use him extensively in stories. And I kind of juiced up his physique a bit." ...|$|E
