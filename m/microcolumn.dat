The use of affinity <b>microcolumns,</b> which contain immobilized binding agents and have volumes in the mid-to-low microliter range, has received particular attention in recent years.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} use of high-performance affinity chromatography (HPAC) and monolithic columns to study drug-protein interactions. The first project studied the binding of imipramine to human serum albumin (HSA) by using HPAC. Frontal analysis and zonal elution competition studies determined that imipramine had one major binding site and a second group of weaker, non-specific binding regions on HSA. ^ The overall objective of {{the remainder of this}} dissertation was to develop microaffinity columns for use in HPAC and drug-protein binding studies. The second project used silica monoliths in affinity <b>microcolumns</b> for the high-throughput analysis of drug-protein interactions. It was found that HSA silica monoliths in affinity <b>microcolumns</b> as short as 1 to 3 mm could be used to provide reliable estimates of retention factor and plate height. A comparison between silica monoliths and silica particles in <b>microcolumns</b> showed that silica monoliths allowed for {{the use of}} faster flow rates because of their better mass transfer properties, which decreased analysis times. ^ The third project used silica particles in columns with lengths from 1 mm to 2 cm to compare affinity <b>microcolumns</b> to traditional longer affinity columns in HPAC. Zonal elution studies showed that retention factor, plate height, and peak asymmetry measurements were fairly consistent across all of the tested flow rates. However, there was a decrease in precision as shorter column lengths were used. Frontal analysis studies determined that association equilibrium constant measurements for all column lengths were consistent. In these studies, using affinity <b>microcolumns</b> for frontal analysis studies to decrease analysis times did not compromise the accuracy of these measurements. ^ The last project used the noncompetitive peak decay method with HSA silica monolith affinity <b>microcolumns</b> to measure the dissociation rate constants of several drugs from HSA. Work with flow rates as high as 10 mL/min made it possible to provide dissociation rate constants for warfarin in less than 40 s. This method was then extended to other drugs known to bind to HSA, including diazepam, imipramine, acetohexamide, and tolbutamide. ...|$|R

Such effects are expected not only in photonic crystals but also in some disordered structures.

Stacking of pulses generated deeper <b>microcolumns.</b> Clinical observations and in vivo histology demonstrate rapid re-epithelization and limited adverse side effects. Facial treatments were performed in the periorbital and perioral areas using 1 – 8 passes of single and stacked pulses. Treatments were well-tolerated and subjects could resume their normal routine in 4 days. A statistically significant reduction in wrinkle scores at 3 months was observed for both periorbital and perioral wrinkles using blinded grading. For periorbital treatments of four passes or more, over 90 % had ≥ 1 score wrinkle reduction (0 – 9 scale) and 42 % had ≥ 2. For perioral wrinkles, over 50 % had substantial improvements (≥ 2). Conclusion The clinical observations and histology findings demonstrate that micro-fractional ablative treatment with 2, 790 and 2, 940 nm erbium lasers resulted in safe and effective wrinkle reduction with minimal patient downtime. The depth and width of the ablated <b>microcolumns</b> and varying extent of surrounding coagulation can be controlled and used to design new treatment procedures targeted for specific indications and areas such as moderate to severe rhytides and photodamaged skin.

40|$|Dense {{arrays of}} high-aspect-ratio silicon <b>microcolumns</b> and microcones are formed by {{cumulative}} nanosecond pulsed excimer laser irradiation of single-crystal silicon in oxidizing atmospheres such as air and SF 6. Growth of such surface microstructures requires a redeposition model and also involves elements of self-organization. The {{shape of the}} microstructures, i. e. straight columns vs steeply sloping cones and connecting walls, is governed by the type and concentration of the oxidizing species, e. g. oxygen vs fluorine. Growth is believed to occur by a �catalyst-free� VLS (vapor-liquid-solid) mechanism that involves repetitive melting of {{the tips of the}} columns/cones and deposition there of the ablated flux of Si-containing vapor. Results are presented of a new investigation of how such different final microstructures as <b>microcolumns</b> or microcones joined by walls nucleate and develop. The changes in silicon surface morphology were systematically determined and compared as the number of pulsed KrF (248 nm) laser shots was increased from 25 to several thousand in both air and SF 6. The experiments in air and SF 6 reveal significant differences in initial surface cracking and pattern formation. Consequently, local protrusions are first produced and column or cone/wall growth is initiated by different processes and at different rates. Differences in the spatial organization of column or cone/wall growth also are apparent...|$|R
