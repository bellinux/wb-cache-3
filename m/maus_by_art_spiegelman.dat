40|$|Esta dissertação tem por objetivo evidenciar a expansão das possibilidades representativas que ocorre na {{literatura}} sobre o Holocausto. Para tanto, analisam-se dois livros – a obra Maus, escrita por <b>Art</b> <b>Spiegelman,</b> um romance gráfico no qual há uma inexorável interação entre imagem e texto, e o romance Os emigrantes, de W. G. Sebald, no qual também existe um diálogo entre fotografias selecionadas pelo autor e prosa literária – procurando-se investigar como esses textos ultrapassam aqueles discursos padronizados, o lugar-comum, que rondam as representações do Holocausto. Apesar de reconhecer e, ainda, de analisar os discursos que ressaltam os aspectos irrepresentáveis do evento em questão, este trabalho caminha em sentido contrário ao assinalar as novas possibilidades de representação do tema que surgem com a atualização dos meios de comunicação e das mídias na sociedade ocidental contemporânea. Essas mudanças notórias, como a ascensão da imagem como uma forma de expressão que antecipa o declínio da leitura linear da escrita, acontecem desde o imediato pós-guerra (meados de 1940), e isso se reflete na expressão da literatura que tem o Holocausto como objeto de representação. Graças a este estudo, pode-se notar que a ampliação das formas de representação do Holocausto se dá de forma mais evidente a partir da inclusão da imagem junto ao texto literário. É importante compreender também que, assim como se deu a expansão da forma literária, com a inserção de imagens, seu conteúdo, ou seja, a referência a sentimentos, tempos, espaços e vítimas do Holocausto, sofreu, igualmente, evidente ampliação. No que se refere às obras estudadas, Maus e Os emigrantes demonstram que o Holocausto ultrapassa o período da Segunda Guerra Mundial, de 1939 - 1945. Além disso, elas põem em evidência outros lugares em que a repressão nazista esteve presente que não só os campos de concentração, como também ressaltam a existência de inusitadas vítimas, por exemplo, emigrantes que fugiram da perseguição hitlerista. ____________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis work aims {{to evidence}} {{the expansion of}} representative possibilities that occurs in the literature about the Holocaust. For this, two books will be analyzed – the book <b>Maus,</b> written <b>by</b> <b>Art</b> <b>Spiegelman,</b> a graphic novel {{in which there is}} an inevitable interaction between image and text, and the novel The emigrants, written by W. G. Sebald, in which there is also a dialogue between photographs selected by the author and literary prose – seeking to investigate how these texts beyond those standardized discourse, the commonplace, that surround the representations of the Holocaust. Despite of recognize and, also, analyze the discourses that highlight aspects unrepresentable of the Holocaust, this work is moving in the opposite direction to signal the new possibilities of representation of the theme that come with the update of media of the contemporary occidental society. These remarkable changes, as the rise of the image as a form of expression that anticipates the decline of reading linear writing, have been held since the immediate post-war (Mid 1940), and this reflects in the expression of literature that has the Holocaust as representation object. Thanks to this study, it may be noted that the expansion of forms of representation of the Holocaust takes more evident from the inclusion of the image with the literary text. It is also important to understand that just as the expansion of the literary form with the inclusion of the image, the content, namely, the reference to feelings, time, space and Holocaust victims, suffered equally clear magnification. With regard to the works studied, Maus and The emigrants show that the Holocaust exceeded the period of World War II, of 1939 - 1945. Moreover, they highlight other places where the Nazi repression was present that not only the concentration camps, they also show the existence of unexpected victims, for example, immigrants who fled Hitler persecution...|$|R

50|$|In the Polish Defensive War of 1939, Częstochowa was {{defended by}} the 7th Infantry Division, part of {{northern}} wing of Kraków Army. After the Battle of Mokra and other battles, Polish forces withdrew, and the Wehrmacht entered {{the city on}} Sunday, September 3, 1939. Częstochowa was renamed into Tschenstochau, and incorporated into the General Government. Monday, September 4, 1939, became known as Bloody Monday or also Częstochowa massacre, when 227 people (205 ethnic Poles and 22 Jews) {{were killed by the}} Germans (some estimates of victims put the number at more than 1,000; 990 ethnic Poles and 110 Jews). German occupiers from the very beginning initiated a plan of cultural and physical extermination of the Polish nation. Częstochowa was a city county (Stadkreis Tschenstochau), part of Radom District of the General Government. The city was located near the border with Upper Silesia Province, and in its area operated units of the Home Army and National Armed Forces (NSZ). On April 20, 1943, a NZS unit attacked local office of the Bank Emisyjny w Polsce. After the collapse of the Warsaw Uprising, Częstochowa briefly was the capital of the Polish Underground State. In the autumn 1944, Germans fortified the city, preparing for a lengthy defence. On January 16, 1945, however, the Wehrmacht retreated after one day of fighting. On April 9, 1941, a ghetto for Jews was created. During World War II approximately 45,000 of Częstochowa's Jews, almost the entire Jewish community living here, were killed by the Germans. Life in Nazi-occupied Częstochowa is depicted in the Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel <b>Maus,</b> <b>by</b> <b>Art</b> <b>Spiegelman,</b> the son of a Jewish Częstochowa resident. Before the Holocaust, Częstochowa was considered a great Jewish center in Poland. By the end of WWII, nearly all Jews had been killed or deported to be killed, making Częstochowa what the Nazis called Judenfrei.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of two comic books entitled <b>Maus</b> <b>by</b> <b>Art</b> <b>Spiegelman,</b> the comics about the Holocaust became a separate category of graphic stories referring to history. The appearance of albums by Spiegelman may also {{be treated as a}} certain caesura on the Polish market of comics. Until that time, no Polish author of comic strips had even tried {{to come to grips with}} the topic of the Holocaust; even today they would rather avoid this topic. Taking no account of the reasons behind such abandonment, it is worth noting that Polish authors clearly gave ground to the creators from the West who, with mixed success, filled in this significant gap and their comics were later translated into Polish. The main purpose of the article is to show a panorama of comic books by Polish and Western authors, which have been published in Poland until now and, in various ways, touch upon the question of the Holocaust, thus becoming a part of a postcatastrophic discourse. The aim of the undertaken considerations is not solely the creation of the inventory but also a fragmentary but critical analysis of the contents of the mentioned comic strips...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The primary {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to investigate}} {{the manner in which}} certain examples of post-Holocaust second and third generation literature negotiate questions of memory, history and the archive, when writing about the Holocaust from a specific spatial and temporal remove. This is undertaken via close readings of three texts, namely: <b>Maus</b> <b>by</b> <b>Art</b> <b>Spiegelman,</b> Austerlitz by Sebald and Everything is Illuminated by Jonathan Safran Foer. Each text required a slightly different theoretical approach and exhibits a different set of subject positions, however they all share the characteristics of generic blurring, self-conscious narration and intertextuality and use these to dramatise their own provisionality. I make specific use of Marianne Hirsch’s term postmemory alongside various theories of the archive including Derrida’s Archive Fever in order to describe these texts’ relation to a remote past. In particular I analysed Maus in terms of postmemory, while considering Spiegelman’s complex visual palimpsest as an archive. Austerlitz was analysed via conceptions of the uncanny and a Derridian elaboration of the concept of the spectre. With specific reference to the inclusion of photographs in the text I show how the spectre of the Holocaust comes to haunt the text, allowing the author to reference it indirectly. Everything is Illuminated, which I believe is an under-theorised text, was analysed in terms of its epistolary structure and its engagement with silence and absence in order to analyse the expression of postmemory from the additional temporal remove of the third generation. Using Hal Foster’s view of the archival impulse expressed in certain art forms I conclude that these texts exhibit an archival approach to the events of the past. I argue that in highlighting its own provisionality each text avoids expressing an authoritative version of the past, and thus avoids the destruction of the heterogeneity of the archival trace...|$|E
