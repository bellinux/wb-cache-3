The two-section DBR lasers discussed in this letter, consisting of a gain section and an unpumped Bragg reflector, typically exhibit one <b>mode</b> <b>hop</b> in a 10 K temperature range. Although the longer wavelength modes are expected to start lasing when raising device temperature, occasional <b>mode</b> <b>hops</b> to a shorter wavelength are seen.

40|$|The {{scientific}} goal of {{the project}} was the investigation of the basic principles of a broadly tunable laser diode spectrometer with a narrow linewidth, enabling an effective and simple gas analysis in process gas monitoring and environmental technique. The design of the spectrometer occurs on the basis of commercially available anti-reflection coated VIS- and NIR-laser diodes operating in external resonators. Particularly with the realized different grating resonators, the results of our theoretical investigation concerning <b>mode</b> <b>hop</b> free tuning ranges could be verified. By using these optimized configurations <b>mode</b> <b>hop</b> free tuning ranges across the whole gain region of the laser diodes could be realized. Furthermore, the properties of a spectrometer with a high output power was determined. In order to qualify the spectrometer, absorption measurements of selected gases has been performed. In addition, the basic principles of anti-reflection coatings for laser diodes were investigated. By using a special simulation code, an optimization of the coating parameters could be achieved. By this means, high quality coatings with different materials could be realized. (orig.)

This laser can be tuned with very fine steps, which is a compulsory characteristic for gas sensing applications. Moreover the laser is free of <b>mode</b> <b>hopping</b> within a spectral range sufficiently wide to match one of the ro-vibrational lines of a target molecule. Here the proposed laser reached, at ∼ 1530 nm, a continuous tuning range of around 950 pm (> 100 GHz) before <b>mode</b> <b>hopping</b> occurred, when a silicon wafer of 355 μm thickness was used. Additionally, the laser can be finely tuned with small tuning steps of < 12 pm, achieving a resolution of 84. 6 pm °C- 1 and by using a thermo-electric cooler (TEC) the laser showed a high wavelength stability over time. These tuning characteristics are sufficient to detect molecules such as acetylene in which the mean separation between two ro-vibrational lines is around 600 pm.

40|$|International audienceIn this {{contribution}} {{we provide}} an in depth theoretical {{analysis of the}} bifurcations leading to nonlinear polarization dynamics in a free-running vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL). We detail the sequence of bifurcations that occurs when increasing the injection current, and which brings the laser from linear to elliptical polarization emission and then self-pulsating or even more complex chaotic dynamics of the light intensity. Continuation techniques allow us to follow the stable and unstable limit cycle solutions emerging from Hopf bifurcations, and therefore to interpret {{the frequency of the}} self-pulsating polarization dynamics. The fundamental frequency of the pulsating dynamics is either close to the laser relaxation oscillation frequency or close to the linear-birefringence-induced polarization mode frequency splitting, depending on the laser parameters. A systematic analysis of the parameter space allows us to identify two scenarios that are in excellent qualitative agreement with those reported in recent experiments. Our results provide, moreover, evidence for an interesting polarization <b>mode</b> <b>hopping</b> mechanism, i. e., a so-called deterministic <b>mode</b> <b>hopping</b> where the laser exhibits a chaotic and therefore random-like hopping between two states that are elliptically polarized and nonorthogonal...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{demonstrate}} first {{experimental evidence}} of polarization switching in Stranski-Krastanov (SK) and submonolayer (SML) quantum dot (QD) vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). In {{the case of}} a SMLQD VCSEL polarization switching is accompanied by polarization <b>mode</b> <b>hopping</b> and is associated with a change of linearly polarized light to elliptically polarized one, hence switching takes place between elliptically polarized states. Current-modulation measurements show that the polarization switching is of thermal origin. Exponential decrease of the dwell time with the pump current has been demonstrated as opposed to exponential increase observed in quantum well (QW) VCSELs when polarization <b>mode</b> <b>hopping</b> takes place between orthogonal, linearly polarized states. In the case of SK-QD VCSELs single polarization switching events stimulated by the increase of the wafer temperature have been observed. After the single switching event the polarization of light remains stable at any wafer temperature and pump current while its direction is perpendicular to that before switching. We will furthermore show preliminary theoretical results on the nonlinear dynamics of a QD laser subject to optical injection, paying particular attention to the influence of the linewidth enhancement factor and the intradot transition time-scales...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{parametric}} oscillators (OPO) are {{sources of}} coherent light, {{often used to}} produce laser like light in wavelength regions where ordinary laser operation is challenging. In terms of chemistry, most attractive such a region is in mid-infrared, where strong fundamental vibrational transitions occur. OPOs are based on nonlinear polarization, which some materials exhibit when radiated with strong coherent light and effectively allow transferring optical power from one wavelength region to another. Even a simple OPO setup can offer watt-level of continuous-wave power in mid-infrared. There are ongoing challenges with the stability of OPO output frequency and continuous tuning of the wavelength, {{both of which are}} important for a light source used in high-resolution molecular spectroscopy. Theory and literature part of this thesis first covers the fundamentals of the theory behind OPO, centering on a continuous-wave single resonant operation. Afterwards, we look into the more well-known features affecting the stability of the OPO, as well as some common schemes used to combat the instabilities. In the experimental part, we measure and attempt to characterize some features of instabilities we have previously noticed that are not readily explained by known instability sources. The OPO's output wavelength occasionally changes in discrete jumps known as <b>mode</b> <b>hops.</b> There appear to be some preferences to the magnitude of these jumps that do not seem to fit in the current understanding of OPO operation. We followed the frequency changes of a typical singly resonant continuous-wave OPO for longer time periods and offered some possible explanations for the observations.

The equations are then solved and the stability of their solutions is analyzed. Depending upon the fill factors for the two modes, there exists an intrinsically multimode oscillation for operating conditions under which it was previously thought that no steady state existed. Under conditions where the multimode state is unstable, both of the single-mode states are stable with bistable transitions occurring only on the boundaries of the unstable multimode regimes...|$|R
