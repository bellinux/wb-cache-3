5|$|A {{successor}} for the C3 Picasso {{was revealed}} in 2017 {{as the new}} C3 Aircross, and revealed at the Geneva Motor Show in March as the C-Aircross Concept, with an expected launch in late 2017. Auto Express reported the vehicle is taking design cues from the C-Aircross Concept, and will <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> from MPV to an SUV design.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, Spokane {{is still}} trying to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to a more service-oriented economy {{in the face of a}} less {{prominent}} manufacturing sector. Developing the city's strength in the medical and health sciences fields has seen some success, resulting in the expansion of the University District with two medical school branches. The city faces challenges such as a scarcity of high-paying jobs, pockets of poverty, and areas of high crime.|$|E

5|$|When digital {{television}} launched on 1 January 2001, {{the majority of}} households {{did not know of}} or were unable to buy a set top box in order to receive the signal. Digital Broadcasting Australia was established in late 2000 to help <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to {{digital television}} as seamless for consumers as possible. It included representatives from free-to-air broadcasters, manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers and was intended to provide information about commencement dates, coverage, and the functionality and availability of equipment.|$|E
5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, the patient is de-certified (discharged) from hospice. The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to the patient, and the patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E
5|$|Playschool or leikskóli, is non-compulsory {{education}} for those {{under the age}} of six, and {{is the first step in}} the education system. The current legislation concerning playschools was passed in 2007. The Ministry of Education, Science and Culture is responsible for the policies and methods that playschools must use, and they issue the National Curriculum Guidelines. They are also responsible for ensuring that the curriculum is suitable so as to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> into compulsory education as easy as possible. However, the Ministry does not implement the regulations and guidelines; instead this is the responsibility of the local authority, who fund and administer playschools. In addition, the local authority employs representatives who supervise the playschools’ operation.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after losing}} Super Bowl XLI, Hester and special teams coach Dave Toub spent a {{significant}} amount of time working on new return strategies and formations. Ultimately, Lovie Smith converted Hester into a wide receiver in order {{to increase the number of}} opportunities he would receive during a game. Hester, who originally played as a wide receiver at the University of Miami, was initially hesitant about making the switch to offense, as he wished to follow in the footsteps of Deion Sanders. However, the Bears’ coaching staff eventually persuaded Hester to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> over the summer. During the 2007 off-season, Hester won the Best Breakthrough Athlete ESPY Award.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Finnhorse's {{image as}} a working farm horse, the breed {{was used as a}} cavalry mount from the 17thcentury until the end of World War II. After the {{mechanisation}} of Finnish agriculture in the 1960s and the 1970s, however, it was not clear if the Finnhorse would <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> into a riding horse, even though the long use of the breed by the Finnish cavalry had proven it well-suited for the job. The Finnhorse had a strong {{image as a}} harnessed working horse, associated with rural life and old times. When riding as a hobby emerged and became more established in Finnish cities during the 1960s, imported horses and ponies were preferred as mounts; warmblooded horses represented modern times, leisure time and wealth, while the Finnhorse was viewed as rugged and unsophisticated. The riding section studbook, created in 1971, grew slowly and gained only a few dozen horses during its first decade, as the idea of a Finnhorse used for riding was considered near-ridiculous at the time.|$|E
5|$|Flora Duffy {{was invited}} to {{participate}} in the Beijing Olympics based on her performance in the qualification competitions. Participating on the August 18 event, Duffy competed in the women's triathlon. Duffy swam the 1.5kilometers portion of the distance in 20:26minutes, ranking 41st out of 55 in that portion of the event, behind Luxembourg's Liz May (40th) by under a second and ahead of Hungary's Zita Szabó by two seconds. In this portion of the event, Duffy was 37 seconds behind the United States' Laura Bennett, who finished the swimming portion of the event first at 19:49. Duffy took 33 seconds to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> from swim to cycling, the second part of the event, tying with Mak So Ning of Hong Kong at 52nd place out of 55. Duffy, however, was lapped on the bike leg and was disqualified before reaching the running portion or completing the event.|$|E

25|$|Vélez's accent {{would likely}} hamper {{her ability to}} <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition.</b> That idea was dispelled after she {{appeared}} in her first all-talking picture in 1929, the Rin Tin Tin's vehicle Tiger Rose. The film was a hit and Vélez's sound career was established.|$|E
50|$|The Law School {{has only}} one department, Public Law; the Political Science Department has opened in 2007. It was founded in {{response}} to a need for experts in the field of law as Iraq <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> into a constitutional law based political system.|$|R

40|$|The {{dark energy}} {{crossing}} of the cosmological constant boundary (<b>the</b> <b>transition</b> between <b>the</b> quintessence and phantom regimes) is {{described in terms of}} the implicitly defined dark energy equation of state.

30|$|Since {{for most}} values of λ, the {{oscillating}} state is more strongly attracting {{than the other}} attractors, virtually all trajectories {{will end up in}} the state in which all nodes are oscillating. Provided all nodes are connected and β is not very small, trajectories in which a node <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to <b>the</b> oscillating state and back again before another node <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> at all are rare. Thus, it still makes sense to think of the whole network as having undergone a transition with an associated escape time. However, since not all nodes in the network begin oscillating at exactly the same time, we need to define the escape time for a trajectory of a network. The definition of escape time we will use for the network is that the escape has occurred when {{at least half of the}} nodes in the network have made <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> to <b>the</b> limit-cycle.|$|R
