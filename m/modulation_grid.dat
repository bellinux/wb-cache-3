40|$|The satellite, its {{operations}} {{and the organization}} of the data analysis, have been detailed by Perryman et al. (1992) and Kovalevsky et al. (1992). Thanks to a combination of two mirrors the images of stars in two fields 58 ” apart on the sky are formed in the focal plane of a 290 mm telescope. The images of the stars that are at a given time in the 0 ”. 9 x 0 ”. 9 field of the telescope are modulated by a <b>modulation</b> <b>grid</b> with a 1 ”. 2 gridstep. The distance between the maxima of two modulation curves corresponding to two stars can be determined with a high precision, which gives the angular distance of the projection of the two stars on the direction perpendicular to the grid slits. As the satellite revolves around its axis in a little over 2 h it scans a great circle of the celestial sphere, the Scanning Great Circle, whose plane is perpendicular to the grid slits. But the axis of rotation of the satellite is made to precess in about 57 days around the direction of the Sun so that successive scanning circles do not coincide. Every five scanning circles a mean great circle, called Reference Great Circl...|$|E

These goals will be {{pursued by the}} Gamma Ray Imaging Device (GRID) instrument, one of three instruments recently selected for NASA's Max ' 91 Solar Balloon Program. The GRID instrument {{is based on the}} technique of Fourier transform imaging and utilizes scanning <b>modulation</b> <b>grid</b> collimator optics to provide full-Sun imaging with 1. 9 -arcsecond resolution over the energy range from 20 to 700 keV at time resolutions from 0. 1 to 2 s. The GRID telescope will employ 32 subcollimators, each composed of a matched pair of high-Z collimator grids separated by 5. 2 meters and a phoswich scintillation spectrometer detector having no spatial resolution. The subcollimators and integrally-mounted fine aspect system are contained within a telescope canister which will be pointed to 0. 1 degree accuracy and cyclically scanned to produce source modulation. The 32 subcollimators provide a uniform distribution of grid slit orientations and a logarithmic distribution of slit spacings corresponding to angular dimensions of 1. 9 arcseconds to several arcminutes. The instrument is several orders of magnitude more sensitive than the HXIS instrument on the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) and nearly 10 times more sensitive than any similar instrument scheduled to fly during the next solar maximum.

40|$|Abstract: In {{recent history}} {{there has been}} an {{enormous}} development in the subject area of Power Line Communications (PLC), since it has become possible due to advanced digital communications and digital signal processing techniques to use power lines for data transmission. PLC allows the use of the dynamic and far-reaching power cables to support high speed communication capabilities. Discrete Multi-tone (DMT) is a form of multicarrier modulation (MCM), particularly suited to wire line communications, therefore it is more suitable modulation technique for PLC systems. In this paper, we present an overview of various bit loading algorithms that are proposed in literature, of a DMT system for smart grid applications using PLC. For the PLC transceivers, we consider DMT modulation based on an adaptive bit loading technique of the subcarriers. We have also compared two basic rate adaptive bit loading algorithms, Water-filling and Levin Campello, for PLC in Smart Grid communication applications.

The entorhinal cortex is no exception: like the hippocampus, it receives cholinergic and GABAergic input from the medial septal area, the central controller of theta. Grid cells, like hippocampal place cells, show strong theta <b>modulation.</b> [...] <b>Grid</b> cells from layer II of the MEC also resemble hippocampal place cells in that they show phase precession—that is, their spike activity advances from late to early phases of the theta cycle as an animal passes through a grid vertex. Most grid cells from layer III do not precess, but their spike activity is largely confined to half of the theta cycle. The grid cell phase precession is not derived from the hippocampus, because it continues to appear in animals whose hippocampus has been inactivated by an agonist of GABA.|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} paper provided {{the information about}} low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) scheme for the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), and wind energy conversion system. The dc-link voltage is uncomfortable by the generator side converter instead of the grid-side converter (GSC). Considering the nonlinear correlation between the generator speed (ωm) and the dc-link voltage (Vdc), a dc-link Voltage controller is anticipated using a hysteresis current controller. Among all, low-voltage ride-through has been fundamental in the field, {{which is one of}} the most important challenges for wind energy conversion system. It is essential to design an included controller to protect the converter from overvoltage/overcurrent and to support the grid voltage during faults and recoveries. A unified dc-link voltage control scheme and hysteresis current controller based wind energy conversion system is proposed. The controllers for grid-side converters are coordinated to provide fault ride-through capability.

40|$|Faced {{with the}} {{prospect}} of increasing utilization of the transmission and distribution infrastructure without significant upgrade, the domestic electric power utility industry is investing heavily in technologies to improve network dynamic performance through a program loosely referred to as Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS). Devices exploiting recent advances in power electronics are being installed in the power system to offset the need to construct new transmission lines. These devices collectively represent investment potential of several billion dollars over the next decade. A similar development, designed to curtail the peak loads and thus defer new transmission, distribution, and generation investment, falls under a category of technologies referred to as demand side management (DSM). A subset of broader conservation measures, DSM acts directly on the load to reduce peak consumption. DSM techniques include direct load control, in which a utility has the ability to curtail specific loads as conditions warrant. A novel approach has been conceived by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to combine the objectives of FACTS and the technologies inherent in DSM to provide a distributed power system dynamic controller. This technology has the potential to dramatically offset major investments in FACTS devices by using direct load control to achieve dynamic stability objectives. The potential value of distributed versus centralized <b>grid</b> <b>modulation</b> has been examined by simulating the western power grid under extreme loading conditions.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P EE 2016 Dongx, 78 pages :color illustrationsOver {{the last}} decade, fiber-optic {{communications}} have evolved from early non-coherent systems to digital coherent systems {{in order to}} comply with the exponential growth of bandwidth demand. Advanced optical modulation formats offering high spectral efficiencies have been successfully employed in conjunction with coherent receivers and digital signal processing (DSP). Additionally, complex network architectures utilizing reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADMs), flexible <b>grid,</b> <b>modulation</b> format and bandwidth have been incorporated in order to promote dynamicity, flexibility and better utilization of available transmission capacity. The fundamental technology shift brought about by digital coherent systems also impacted the roles, functionalities and research direction of optical performance monitoring (OPM) and long-haul transmission strategies: 1) Since all the linear impairments such as chromatic dispersion (CD) and polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) can be estimated and fully compensated by numerous DSP algorithms in the digital coherent receiver, system performance is largely determined by the optical-signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) and hence OSNR monitoring is most vital for long-haul coherent communication systems. 2) Because of Kerr nonlinearities, current fiber-optic transmission technologies designed for linear channels will not be capable of meeting the customer bandwidth demand even equipped with nonlinear compensation techniques such as digital back propagation (DBP). New transmission strategies fundamentally compatible with fiber nonlinearity is expected in the next few years. Therefore, this thesis will focus on the development of OSNR monitoring techniques and nonlinearity-compatible transmission strategies for long-haul digital coherent systems. In particular, a nonlinearity-insensitive OSNR monitoring technique is proposed as most fiber-optic systems are operating in the weakly nonlinear regime where nonlinear distortions are indistinguishable from ASE noise and thus traditional OSNR monitoring techniques cannot work accurately in such circumstance. It characterize fiber nonlinearity induced amplitude noise correlation among neighboring symbols as a quantitative measure of nonlinear distortions to the signal. By incorporating/calibrating such amplitude noise correlations into an error vector magnitude (EVM) -based OSNR estimator, nonlinearity-insensitive OSNR monitoring can be achieved. Experimental as well as simulation results demonstrate an accurate OSNR monitoring for both 112 Gb/s polarization-multiplexed (PM) -quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) systems and 224 Gb/s PM- 16 -Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) systems where the launched power can go up to 4 dBm. In addition, OSNR monitoring is still needed ubiquitously across the network including intermediate nodes. However, using full digital coherent receivers with symbol-rate bandwidth is simply too costly and impractical for this purpose. A low-cost and filtering-effect-insensitive OSNR monitor for distributed monitoring of optical networks is proposed. It utilizes reduced-complexity coherent receptions, electrical filtering and radio frequency (RF) power measurements. By measuring the RF power of three different frequency components of the coherently received baseband signals, the proposed technique is also insensitive to spectral narrowing by wavelength selective switches (WSSs). We experimentally demonstrate accurate (< 0. 7 dB error) OSNR monitoring for various modulation formats and transmission distances, hence different number of WSSs. We also study the robustness of the proposed technique to the fiber nonlinearity, laser effects in a five-channel wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) system at 50 -GHz spacing and other practical considerations. Finally, nonlinear frequency division multiplexing (NFDM), a new transmission strategy that incorporates soliton theory with communication theory and fundamentally compatible with fiber nonlinearity is proposed and experimentally verified for the first time. It is based on the framework of nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT) and resembles the commonly-known orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) philosophy in that independent information streams are encoded in parallel sub-carriers (eigenvalues) that are analytically shown to be independent of each other upon propagation in an ideal noiseless and lossless fiber channel. In principle, NFDM is also largely immune to XPM effects and thus it can potentially be a fundamental paradigm shift in long-haul WDM optical communications. On-off keying (OOK) modulated NDFM systems are investigated by simultaneous and independent modulation of 3 -eigenvalue multi-soliton NFDM signals. The signal set consists of 1 -, 2 -, 3 -solitons as well as their various nonlinear combinations. Error-free transmission over an 1800 km link of standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) with Raman amplification and coherent detection is demonstrated. Extensions to 4 -eigenvalue transmissions are also experimentally investigated. Additionally, simulations are performed to study the impact of frequency offset and laser phase noise on such systems and the results show that they are robust to the frequency offset and laser phase noise in a certain range.
