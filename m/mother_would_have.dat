That's a fear that I think any adopted <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have.</b> I think that's going to really help the audience relate to Regina in some level." [...] The role of Rumpelstiltskin was given to Robert Carlyle; it was written with Carlyle in mind, though the writers initially thought he would never accept the part. Horowitz recalled Carlyle's prison sequence, which was the actor's first day on the set as [...] "mind-blowing... You could see Ginny actually jump, the first time he did that character. It was fantastic!" [...] The writers offered the part of the Blue Fairy to recording artist Lady Gaga, but never heard back from her management staff.|$|E

Mariska Hargitay was born January 23, 1964, after the actual divorce but before California ruled it valid. Mariska later became an actress, {{best known for her}} role as Olivia Benson in [...] After her birth, Mansfield sued to get the Juarez divorce declared legal and won. The divorce was recognized in the United States on August 26, 1964. Shortly after Mansfield's funeral, Mickey Hargitay sued his former wife's estate for more than $275,000 ($ in [...] dollars) to support the children whom he and his third (and last) wife, Ellen Siano, would raise. Hargitay was appointed the guardian of Mickey, Zoltan, and Mariska by a court decree in June 1967, though they went on living with their mother. He married airline stewardess Ellen Siano in 1968, who accompanied him to New Orleans when he went to pick up his three children with Mansfield after her death. In January 1969, he lost his claim of $275,533 from Mansfield's estate to support the three children ($ in [...] dollars).

500|$|The Princess of Wales {{opposed the}} match between her {{daughter}} and the Prince of Orange, and had great public support: [...] when Charlotte went out in public, crowds would urge her not to abandon her mother by marrying the Prince of Orange. [...] Charlotte informed the Prince of Orange that if they wed, her <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to be welcome in their home—a condition sure to be unacceptable to the Prince Regent. [...] When the Prince of Orange would not agree, Charlotte broke off the engagement. [...] Her father's response was to order that Charlotte remain at her residence at Warwick House (adjacent to Carlton House) until she could be conveyed to Cranbourne Lodge at Windsor, where she {{would be allowed to}} see no one except the Queen. [...] When told of this, Charlotte raced out into the street. [...] A man, seeing her distress from a window, helped the inexperienced Princess find a hackney cab, in which she was conveyed to her mother's house. [...] Caroline was visiting friends and hastened back to her house, while Charlotte summoned Whig politicians to advise her. [...] A number of [...] family members also gathered, including her uncle, the Duke of York—with a warrant in his pocket to secure her return by force if need be. [...] After lengthy arguments, the Whigs advised her to return to her father's house, which she did the next day.|$|E
500|$|Although Godwin admired Wollstonecraft's writings, he did {{not agree}} with her that women should receive the same {{education}} as men. Therefore, he occasionally read to Fanny and Mary from Sarah Trimmer's Fabulous Histories (1786) and Anna Laetitia Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778–79), but, according to Todd, {{he did not}} take great pains with their educations and disregarded the books Wollstonecraft had written for Fanny. [...] William St Clair, in his biography of the Godwins and the Shelleys, argues that Godwin and Wollstonecraft spoke extensively about the education they wanted for their children and that Godwin's writings in The Enquirer reflect these discussions. He contends that after Wollstonecraft's death Godwin wrote to a former pupil to whom she had been close, now Lady Mountcashell, asking her advice on how to raise and educate his daughters. In her biography of Mary Shelley, Miranda Seymour agrees with St Clair, arguing that [...] "everything we know about his daughter's [...] early years suggests that she was being taught in a way of which her <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> approved", pointing out that she had a governess, a tutor, a French-speaking stepmother, and a father who wrote children's books whose drafts he read to his own first. It was the new Mrs Godwin who was primarily responsible for the education given to the girls, but she taught her own daughter more, including French. Fanny received no formal education after her stepfather's marriage. Yet, the adult Imlay is described by C. Kegan Paul, one of Godwin's earliest biographers, as [...] "well educated, sprightly, clever, a good letter-writer, and an excellent domestic manager". Fanny excelled in drawing and was taught music. Despite Godwin's atheism, all of the children were taken to an Anglican church.|$|E

When Tezuka was young, his father showed him Disney films; he became obsessed with the films and began to replicate them.

Tezuka started to draw comics around his second year of elementary school, drawing so [...] much that his <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to erase pages in his notebook in order to keep up with his output.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationship between maternal social support and depression levels amongst Hispanic/Latina and Non-Hispanic/Latina mothers. It was hypothesized that Hispanic/Latina <b>mothers</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> lower levels of depression due to the literature that exists about their large extended family networks of social support and their close networks with their friends (Mcloyd et al., 2000), as well as their likelihood to be less reported or to report to have mental health problems like depression (Samaan, 1998). ^ The study consisted of 53. 4 % (87) Hispanic/Latina and 46. 6 % (76) Non-Hispanic/Latina mothers recruited from 6 day-care centers, a food bank, and a food stamp outreach program in low-income areas of Providence and Woonsocket Rhode Island.

No significance differences were found between groups. Lastly, multiple regression analysis was used to further explain the research question of interest of if the relationship between maternal social support and maternal depression function similarly between Hispanic/Latina and Non-Hispanic/Latina mothers.
