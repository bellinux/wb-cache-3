40|$|We {{consider}} the optimal asset allocation choice of an investor who can invest in cash (a <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>bank</b> account), nominal bonds, and stocks (the stock index). The investor faces an incomplete market setting {{and is not}} able to perfectly hedge long run real interest rate risk using the available securities. The optimal invest- ment strategy is consistent with the following features of popular investment advice which have been pointed out as puzzles: (i) a decreasing fraction of stocks in the portfolio as time passes towards the investment horizon, and (ii) a higher bond to stock ratio for more conservative (less risk tolerant) investors (Canner, Mankiw and Weil, 1997). The model for asset price dynamics is calibrated to US market data and, furthermore, risk aversion parameters and time horizons are calibrated so as to obtain a match between the optimal asset allocations and observed investment recommendations for,"," and " investor groups with di®erent investment horizons.

It not only quantifies the classic liquidity effect, but also uncovers a liquidity distribution effect {{on both sides of}} the market, and shows that their magnitude is a decreasing and convex function of the level of excess reserves. It finds that the volatility of rate changes depends much more on the reserve surplus accumulated within a maintenance period than on the level of excess reserves. As Carpenter and Demiralp (2006), it uses the series of the central bank''s daily forecast errors to identify the liquidity effect.

Announcements of interest rate cuts, liquidity support, liability guarantees, and recapitalization were associated with a reduction of interbank risk premia, albeit to a different degree during the subprime and global phases of the crisis. Decisions not to reduce interest rates and bail out individual banks in an ad hoc manner had adverse repercussions, both domestically and abroad. The results are robust to controlling for the surprise content of announcements and using alternative measures of financial distress.

Later programs emphasized structural reform to support sustainable high growth and poverty reduction. Although macroeconomic stability has been largely achieved, structural reform was gradual and piecemeal, especially under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility.

40|$|This paper {{builds a}} multiperiod, general {{equilibrium}} framework for analyzing the macroeconomic effects of financial reforms {{in developing countries}} {{and the costs of}} maintaining official safety nets under the financial system during such reforms. While a financial liberalization yields efficiency gains, adverse macroeconomic effects can arise if the creditworthiness of the nonfinancial sector is weak. In this situation, financial liberalization may also increase the authorities’ expected deposit insurance funding obligations even with strong prudential supervision. Moreover, given the distortions in a repressed financial system, an increase in the required bank capital-asset ratio may increase the funding obligations associated with deposit insurance, particularly when the debt-servicing capacity of nonfinancial firms is low.

Using a mix of quantitative and qualitative indicators, the paper finds some evidence of price convergence in average interest rate spreads. However, this observed fact is not supported by an increase in cross-border flows in retail loans and deposits, and price convergence may merely reflect excess liquidity in the region. Other data also indicate that bank competition within the CEMAC as a region is limited, complementing the findings on integration. Addressing shortfalls in legal and regulatory frameworks, infrastructure, and markets would facilitate integration.

Findings – The results provide empirical support for the high information content of the IIMMR.

Explaining the rise of shadow banking from this angle paints a very different picture than the supply-side angle that views it as a story of banks'' funding preferences and arbitrage. Institutional cash pools prefer to avoid too much unsecured exposure to banks even through insured deposits. Short-term government guaranteed securities are the next best choice, but their supply is insufficient. The shadow banking system arose to fill this vacuum. One way to manage the size of the shadow banking system is by adopting the supply management of Treasury bills as a macroprudential tool.

Given the weak institutional frameworks, reduced role of securities markets, imperfect competition in the banking sector and the resulting high cost of bank lending to private firms, the traditional channels (interest rate, bank lending, and asset price) are impaired in LICs. The exchange rate channel is also undermined by central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market.

40|$|A {{healthy and}} dynamic {{financial}} sector {{is essential to}} achieving high and sustainable {{economic growth in the}} Maghreb region-Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. Financial integration within the Maghreb region will help deepen financial markets, increase their efficiency, and enhance the resilience of economies to shocks. It can also play a catalyst role for the global financial integration of the Maghreb region. This paper provides an overview of the financial systems, takes stock of the reform effort and highlights the challenges ahead, and examines the prospects for financial integration in the five Maghreb countries.

Based on our micro-level data from the Czech Republic, {{the results indicate that}} the nature of interest rate pass-through differs across banks in the short term (rendering estimators that constrain coefficients across groups to be identical inconsistent) and becomes homogeneous across banks only in the long term, supporting the notion of the law of one price. Mortgage rates and firm rates typically adjust to <b>money</b> <b>market</b> changes, but often less than fully in the long run. Large corporate loans have a smaller mark-up than small loans. Consumer rates have a high mark-up and are not found to exhibit a cointegration relationship with <b>money</b> <b>market</b> rates. Next, we examine how bank characteristics determine the nature of interest rate pass-through in a cross-section of Czech banks. We find evidence for relationship lending, as banks with a stable pool of deposits smooth interest rates and require a higher spread as compensation. Large banks are not found to price their products less competitively. Greater credit risk increases vulnerability to <b>money</b> <b>market</b> shocks. <b>Bank</b> pricing policies, financial structure, monetary transmission. ...|$|R
40|$|The Asian {{financial}} crisis {{marked the beginning}} of worldwide efforts to improve the effectiveness of financial supervision. However, the crisis that started in 2007 ? 08 was a crude awakening: several of these improvements seemed unable to avoid or mitigate the crisis. This paper brings the first systematic analysis of the role of two of these efforts - modifications in the architecture of financial supervision and in supervisory governance - and concludes that they were negatively correlated with economic resilience. Using the emerging distinction between macro- and micro-prudential supervision, we explore to what extent two separate institutions would allow for more checks and balances to improve supervisory governance and, thus, reduce the probability of supervisory failure.

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis, {{originated from}} {{the collapse of}} US housing markets in 2008, reverberates around the world. Its destructive force was felt nowhere more keenly than Western Europe. Indeed, it continues to mire in financial volatility as the debt problem contagiously spreads around the periphery Euro area. Taking a wider historical view of the evolution over the recent decades of the North Atlantic economy, comprising North America and Western Europe, we argue that while trade links were in relative stasis, the increasing and uniquely-close Transatlantic financial relationship was a crucial conduit in transmitting US shocks into global ones.

40|$|This paper {{associates}} {{both the}} increase in risk taken by wholesale banks in the United States and the decline in earnings at wholesale banks in Japan with {{a reduction in the}} franchise value of wholesale banking. In contrast with the conventional view that relates the franchise value of banking to informational advantages over other lenders, this paper argues that banks’ franchise value originates in their provision of liquidity and payments services to their customers. Therefore, the decline in corporate demand for bank liquidity is identified as a major factor explaining the fall of the franchise value. The paper also analyzes recent proposals for banking reform and assesses their relevance for dealing with the problems of wholesale banks.
