New technologies ensure thermal insulation by <b>multiple</b> <b>glazing</b> <b>units</b> so that, maintaining good solar gains, highly glazed buildings can achieve good energy performance during the heating season. More complicated is the management of the energy performance during the cooling season due to high permeability to solar radiation. External shading devices are a suitable solution but they are often neglected for functional and aesthetic reasons. Solar protection devices can be, however, introduced in the air gap of <b>multiple</b> <b>glazing</b> <b>units,</b> providing solar protection without interfering with the building envelope. Solar and thermal properties of several solution of <b>glazing</b> <b>units</b> with in-gap shading devices were measured with advanced experimental set-up, to be compared with conventional systems.

The paper analyzes the behavior of this new kind of collector by means of theoretical calculations and experiments, focusing on both the performance and the reliability aspects. Efficiency measurements according to EN 12975 on prototypes with a slim design report specific values comparable to those of standard flat plate collectors (η 0 = 0. 78, a 1 = 3. 77 W/m 2 K, a 2 = 0. 011 W/m 2 K 2 for a 50 mm thick, argon-filled prototype).

In this regard, glazing technology has gone through rapid evolution. Numerous research and development in glazing fabrication techniques have led to a wider range of design options. Visual transmittance of the <b>glazing</b> <b>unit</b> is important as it determines the amount of daylight through the <b>glazing</b> <b>unit.</b> So, the desired criteria of a glazing system from energy savings point of view is that it should possess higher transmittance in visible spectrum and lower transmittance in infrared region. To check the performance and durability of the glazing systems, thorough research works has been carried out under different conditions.

40|$|The use of {{sunlight}} {{has always been}} a major goal in the design and operation of commercial buildings to minimize electrical consumption of artificial lighting systems. Glazing systems designed to allow optimal visible light transmission also allow significant unwanted direct solar heat gain caused by infrared light. Conversely, glazing systems that are designed to reflect unwanted direct solar heat gain significantly reduce the transmittance of visible light through windows. The goal of this research was to characterize the performance of water as gap-fill for double-glazing units in eliminating the compromises that exist in current glazing systems with respect to light and heat transmittance. An in situ test approach and computer simulations were conducted to measure the performance of water-filled <b>glazing</b> <b>units</b> against air-filled <b>glazing</b> <b>units.</b> The thermal transmittance and solar heat gain coefficient values obtained from both the field experiments and computer simulations, <b>glazing</b> <b>units</b> with air-fill proved better than the <b>glazing</b> <b>units</b> with non-flowing water-fill. However, the high convective coefficient and the high thermal mass of the water can be used to its advantage when it is allowed to flow at peak temperatures, thus, maintaining lower temperature swings indoor.

40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been several {{experimental}} and numerical researches on transparent envelope components that integrate phase change materials (PCMs). To address some of the drawbacks of these systems, new prototypes were created and their summer performance was monitored under Cfa climatic conditions (Turin, Italy). The proposed glazing system comprises a triple <b>glazing</b> <b>unit</b> with a thermotropic layer placed on the outer side, acting as a switchable shading system capable of regulating the phase transition of the PCM. The PCM is tested in both the inner and the outer cavity of the glazing, alternately. In this paper, the summer performance of these responsive glazing systems is reported, complementing the assessment of their performance under winter conditions, which was previously presented in another paper (Bianco et al., 2017). Two additional systems were also tested in parallel for reference purposes: a triple <b>glazing</b> <b>unit</b> with a thermotropic layer only, and a reference triple <b>glazing</b> <b>unit.</b> Direct solar transmission was assessed, and the correlation between glazing temperature and solar transmission coefficient of the thermotropic layer, when coupled with the triple <b>glazing</b> <b>unit,</b> was derived. The solar transmission {{as a function of the}} external surface temperature of the PCM <b>glazing</b> <b>units</b> was also evaluated. The energy performance was assessed by means of a long-term evaluation in addition to daily analyses during cloudy and sunny days. The capability of the aforementioned technologies to improve indoor thermal comfort was investigated, with the effect of the transmitted solar radiation impinging on the occupants also taken into account. The results highlight that the integration of a thermotropic layer in a triple <b>glazing</b> <b>unit</b> allows the cooling load through the transparent component to be reduced by one third when compared to a traditional triple <b>glazing</b> <b>unit.</b> The overall energy performance was found to be primarily affected by the position of the PCM; not only during winter season, but especially in summer, the PCM completed the phase transition only when placed in the outermost cavity. The thermal comfort conditions were improved, when evaluated in terms of traditional PMV, regardless of the position of the PCM layer. However, when the influence of the direct solar radiation impinging on the occupants was taken into account, the solution with the PCM layer located in the inner cavity presented a better performance...|$|R

40|$|For double <b>glazing</b> <b>units</b> with a light-deflecting {{system in}} the cavity between the glass panes, a service life of at least 20 years should be expected. The {{durability}} of such a unit depends on {{the resistance of the}} glass itself, the unit's edge sealing system and the light-deflecting system against the environmental loads acting upon the <b>glazing</b> <b>unit,</b> when installed as a translucent roof element in the building. To verify the durability of the edge seal and of the solar reflectivity of the light-deflecting system factory-made samples of the <b>glazing</b> <b>units,</b> mostly with original dimensions, were exposed to alternating and constant hygrothermal loads.

For the evaluation of the test results the experience with standard tests on insulating glazing systems served as a basis. Thermal transmittance, total energy transmittance, light transmission, adhesion of the sealants and diffusion resistance of the sealants used at the glass edge, gas content and dew point temperatures of the gas in the gap between the glass panes, moisture content of the drying agent in the spacer, temperature resistance of the light deflection system, linear expansion of the deflection system and thickness changes of the gap between the panes were considered.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new method {{to set up}} energy performance requirements and energy classes for windows of all dimensions and configurations. The net energy gain of windows is the solar gain minus the heat loss integrated over the heating season. The net energy gain can be calculated for one orientation or averaged over different orientations. The averaged value {{may be used for}} energy labeling of windows of standard size. Requirements in building codes may also be based on the net energy gain instead of the thermal transmittance of the window. The size and the configuration of the window, i. e. number of <b>glazing</b> <b>units,</b> have a very large effect on the net energy gain.

Units can fail by either breakage or condensation and the scumming that results from excessive moisture gain. On the other hand, sealed <b>glazing</b> <b>units</b> have advantages in the elimination of storm sash, reduction of surfaces that need cleaning to two, and prevention of condensation between panes.

When glazing {{elements of this}} type are applied to mass walls, their strong insulating effects will be further increased by additional passive solar gains. In {{the average of the}} heating period, transparent insulated walls convey more gains from the outside to the inside than heat is lost. Experimental investigations have been performed on south facing walls with a <b>glazing</b> <b>unit</b> composed of two 4 mm glass panes and a 12 mm layer of granulated aerogel sandwiched in between. This unit was mounted on a concrete wall of 0. 2 m thickness. The wall construction has an overall U-value of 0. 97 W/(m 2 K). The U-value of the <b>glazing</b> <b>unit</b> is 1. 1 W/(m 2 K) and the transmittance 0. 5. During the monitoring period from February through May 1986 the concrete wall experienced maximum exterior surface temperatures of 44 °C; for the entire measurement period, the effective U-value of this wall construction amounts to - 0, 5 W/(m 2 K). This period is characterised by 1712 degree days (respectively 3761 Kd for the heating period) and a mean insolation of 2. 1 kWh/(m 2 d) incident on the south facing wall which are typical values for the Central European climate. But even with negative effective U-values, transmission heat losses cannot be prevented altogether. There are periods with very high amounts of surplus heat, and there are also times that allow only for a reduction of transmission losses. The occasional periods with surplus heat may nevertheless compensate for ventilation heat losses. To avoid overheating in summer, some efficient solar protection must be provided.

The thermal resistance of a Venetian blind glazing system varies with the change of slat inclination angle, and it also highly depends on the mean temperature of the glazing and the temperature difference between the indoor and outdoor environment. Inclusion of a Venetian blind modifies both the absolute and relative strengths of convection and radiation. Vertically oriented slats showed the most significant contribution to increasing radiative thermal resistance, which led to the best overall thermal performance.

The main limits of conventional transparent façades related to energy efficiency and IEQ aspects have been overcome developing a new generation of transparent building envelope components called Advanced Integrated Façades This paper evaluates if the thermal behaviour of this kind of technologies can be correctly assessed by means of conventional performance parameters.

40|$|AbstractVacuum <b>glazing</b> <b>units</b> (VGUs) {{are thought}} to be a type of glazing system with {{superior}} effective insulation performance. However, the differential pressure between the outside and the inner spaces and the supporting pillars create a high pre-existing stress field in the constituent glass during fabrication and hence make the units highly susceptible to breakage, even under small applied loads. In order to address this problem, a novel hybrid vacuum/triple glazing system with a pressure equalisation design has been devised and is reported in this paper. In this system, a VGU is enclosed by two glass panels to form a triple <b>glazing</b> <b>unit</b> system. This new design creates an equalised air pressure {{on both sides of the}} VGU hence subjects the VGU to no additional loads apart from the inherent fabrication stresses. This results in a high thermal and sound insulation as well as a more durable safety performance of the hybrid glazing component. Pressure tests were undertaken on the novel glazing system to confirm its reliability. Results show that under various loading levels, the stresses and deflections in the VGU of this novel glazing system always remain at a marginal level, and hence the likelihood of breakage for VGUs can be reduced significantly...|$|R
5000|$|Unique tower {{envelope}} made of cold-bent glass {{emphasizes the}} lightness and {{dynamic of the}} form visually denying the gravity force. Two hundred meters high sculpture, crafted of materials traditionally believed to be fragile and inflexible, symbolizes the idea of evolution spiral as the pinnacle of progress {{and the power of}} human intellect, challenging the forces of nature and the laws of physics. Original façade concept and innovative construction technology allow to create visually organic and flowing 3D form. Double curved tower envelope is provided by the cold bending of reflective glass units. The innovative cold-bent glazing in the curtain wall uses flat double <b>glazed</b> <b>units</b> cold-formed in 3D within the aluminum frame to avoid stepping in geometry. This approach appeared to be both more energy-efficient and more cost-efficient solution in comparison to the stepped curtain wall units previously applied in some twisted unitized facades. During factory fabrication the glass unit is placed in the twisted aluminum frame horizontally and then takes curved shape by its own weight without any thermal treatment. Maximum corner deformation does not exceed 50 mm relative to the opposite corner of the unit. Finally façade looks like continuously twisted spiral glass surface. Currently this curtain wall is the world’s largest cold bent façade in terms of the area in one building. Organic cold-bent glazed ribbon with constant leaning angle at the corners (approx. 14 degrees vertically) creates a stunning optical illusion reflecting the surrounding cityscape vertically with 90-degree twist.Evolution tower total façade area is 40,500 sq m, including 34,500 sq m of the typical facade areas from 3-rd to 51-st level. On each floor the curtain wall consists of 108 parallelogram façade panels 4.3 m high and 1.5m wide. 27 of them have 2 types of different sizes that vary with twist angle from +14 to -14 that largely complicated the construction logistics. However the implementation of this façade structure was successful due to involvement of German façade company Joseph Gartner (Permasteelisa Group) in design and production of tower curtain wall, atrium glazing and canopies /entrances. The company was selected through the tender with 30 façade manufacturers competing for a prestigious contract. The aluminum profiles were extruded in Russia at a specially arranged production line. Despite glass units fabrication in Germany with all associated delivery and customs duties the overall façade cost per m2 remained within the budget of a ‘standard’ benchmark high-rise tower, that was an achievement of German logistics. Double <b>glazed</b> <b>units</b> with energy-efficient multi-functional glass (manufactured by Guardian) provide the energy efficiency and thermal insulation parameters (U-Value) similar to those of standard triple <b>glazed</b> <b>units</b> but with less weight in panoramic floor to ceiling application. The units themselves were assembled in Germany by BGT, who provided long-time warranty for cold bent heat-strengthened glass in a result of multiple tests. Transparent double <b>glazed</b> <b>units</b> consist of triplex 8+6mm from heat-strengthened glass from the outside and 8mm Guardian Standard HP Neutral 60/40 tempered glass on the inside with application of energy efficient coating, significantly reducing the solar gain whilst providing the double <b>glazed</b> <b>unit</b> thermal performance equal to a standard triple <b>glazed</b> <b>unit</b> normally used in Moscow to withstand harsh winter conditions. Guardian SunGuard production technology allows to create almost perfect combination of transparent and spandrel façade areas. Guardian magnetron coating has a special feature - it is colored outside and transparent on the inside, which does not distort the view color unlike tinted glass in mass. With no color filter (color is from the coating, not from coloured glass) the high color quality provides comfortable environment inside the building given that the glass panel is 3m high (floor to ceiling) the perfect daylighting is provided in the office spaces. Glass unit formula with heat-strengthened triplex outside and tempered glass inside allows bending of the unit in installation position to achieve required façade geometry providing additional safety of envelope structure , as in case of destruction the tempered glass (5 times stronger than usual) is fractured in small pieces and triplex lamination film protects it from falling out. Heat strengthened glass triplex gains additional strength and reduces the risk of glass destruction via associated heat soak tests as part of the production process.|$|R

The uncertainty of the Hot Box measurement results was estimated from an uncertainty analysis of the thermal transmittance. Ruggedness experiments consistent with ASTM test method E 1169 – 89 (1999) were performed, and results enabled the researcher to refine the hot box measurement methodology and reduce the variability of the measurements. Finally, hot box calibration experiments were designed and performed in order to account for the various heat transfer losses in the hot box so that the more accurate measurements of the net heat transfer through a fenestration system may be produced. ^ Using a finite element method, two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical heat transfer analyses of the calibrated hot box and fenestration systems were conducted. These analyses were compared with the experimental calibration results. These included two- and three-dimensional numerical heat transfer analyses of the metering chamber extraneous heat transfer, and the specimen flanking heat transfer. Analytical heat transfer results with combined conduction, convection and radiation effects were compared with experimental results. The heat transfer through two different fenestration products (a <b>glazing</b> <b>unit</b> and a PVC framed window with three <b>glazing</b> <b>units)</b> was investigated. The results are compared with the experimental results on these products using the ASTM C 1199 - 97 (2000) standard test method for determining the thermal transmittance (U-factor) and the ISO/DIS 12567 (1999) window thermal testing standard. ...|$|R
