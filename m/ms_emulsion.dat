This emulsification process dispersed oil droplets in water without any emulsifier. Emulsions were prepared with different vegetable oil ratios 5 %, 10 % and 15 % (v/v) using high frequency ultrasounds generated by piezoelectric ceramic transducer vibrating at 1. 7 MHz. The emulsion was prepared with various emulsification times between 0 and 10 h. Oil droplets size was measured by laser granulometry. The pH variation was monitored; electrophoretic mobility and conductivity variation were measured using Zeta-sizer equipment during emulsification process. The results revealed that oil droplets average size decreased significantly (p < 0. 05) during the first 6 h of emulsification process and that from 160 to 1 mu <b>m</b> for <b>emulsions</b> with 5 %, 10 % and from 400 to 29 mu <b>m</b> for <b>emulsion</b> with 15 % of initial oil ratio. For all tested oil ratios, pH measurement showed significant decrease and negative electrophoretic mobility showed the accumulation of OH- at oil/water interface leading to droplets stability in the emulsion.

40|$|We used atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{to study}} the deformation and wetting behavior of large (50 - 250 <b>m)</b> <b>emulsion</b> droplets upon mechanical loading with a colloidal glass probe. Our droplets were obtained from water-in-oil emulsions. By adding gelatin to the water prior to emulsification, also droplets with a bulk elasticity were prepared. Systematic variations of surfactant and gelatin concentrations were made, to investigate their effect on the deformation and wetting behavior of the droplets and to identify the contributions of interfacial tension, bulk elasticity, and expelled water. The AFM experiments were performed in force-distance mode and showed on approach a repulsive regime which in many cases was terminated by a jump-in of the probe. In the case of pure water (i. e. gelatin-free) droplets, the repulsive part of the curve showed a good linearity, thus allowing the extraction of an effective droplet spring constant. This quantity was found to decrease on raising the surfactant concentration from below the critical micelle concentration (cmc) to well above the cmc, and its numerical values were found to correspond remarkably well to literature values for the interfacial tension. Our findings indicate that, on gelatin increase inside the droplets, the bulk elasticity gradually becomes dominant and the droplets' stiffness does not depend anymore on surfactant concentration. Also {{the stability of the}} droplet interface against wetting, as measured by the force at which the jump-in instability occurs, was enhanced by gelatin. For gelatin concentrations of 15 wt %, the droplets were found to behave like purely elastic bodies.

However, optimal conditions during enrichment (aeration, illumination and temperatures around 28 ºC) tend to accelerate autoxidation of PUFA, and the formation of potentially toxic oxidation products. Water-soluble antioxidants like the polyphenolic compound hydroxytyrosol (3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylethanol), a polar molecule found in the water fraction resulting after the milling process of olives, arise as promising compounds to prevent oxidation during Artemia enrichments.

Material and process conditions {{are important for}} microencapsulation success. Oregano, a Mediterranean food ingredient, has increasingly gained interest as a flavor and natural antioxidants source in its essential oil (EO) form. However, EO can suffer oxidation, chemical interactions or volatilization. This work aims to evaluate the releasing ability of entrapped oregano EO from microparticles of different hydrocolloids: starch spherules from native rice starch (with/without CMC and/or gelatin as binding agents), inulin and gelatin/sucrose mixtures. Entrapment was performed by spray- and/or freeze-drying at 15 % OE incorporation level (w/w d. <b>m.).</b> <b>Emulsions</b> were prepared from different formulations and dried at different conditions. The release of EO was evaluated at 25 ºC by UV-VIS spectroscopy and diffusion coefficients (D) calculated. Depending {{on the nature of}} the polymer, EO D varied between 10 - 13 m 2 /s (starch) and 10 - 16 m 2 /s (inulin). For the rice starch system, although the size of spherical aggregates is strongly influenced by starch concentration, D was mainly influenced by gelatin as binding agent (Fig. 1). Higher concentrations of gelatin lead to a faster release of OE. The gelatin/sucrose system, when spray-dried, revealed to be unsuitable for retention and later release of EO. The capsules were unstable and collapsed easily. D was around 10 - 15 m 2 /s, depending on gelatin/sucrose ratio. When freeze-drying was applied the structure was efficient as encapsulating system. Microstructure from gelatin/sucrose (60 : 40) released higher amounts of EO. The D of EO from inulin capsules was only dependent on drying temperature (Fig. 2). A decrease of diffusion coefficient was observed for samples dried above 140 ºC.

Because of these short time-scales, {{it is difficult to}} quantify adsorption and coalescence during processing. A microfluidic device can be used to measure coalescence shortly after droplet formation in laminar flow, and this device was used to assess coalescence of oil-in-water emulsions stabilised with dairy proteins (β-lactoglobulin, whey protein isolate, and oxidised whey protein isolate). Different microfluidic designs were used to vary the protein adsorption time prior to droplet collision. Coalescence stability depended on protein concentration (0. 0002 – 0. 02 wt %) and adsorption time (11 – 173 <b>ms)</b> : <b>emulsion</b> droplets were stable at low protein concentrations (as low as 0. 005 wt % β-lactoglobulin), as long as the time allocated for protein adsorption was sufficient (in this case 31 ms). Protein type was also important for coalescence stability: emulsions stabilised with whey protein isolate were less stable than those with β-lactoglobulin, and coalescence stability further decreased upon protein oxidation. Regarding the effect of pH (3. 0 – 8. 0), coalescence stability was lowest around the protein's isoelectric point. With the coalescence channel we demonstrated the importance of adsorption time and interface composition for coalescence stability at low protein concentrations. Coalescence can be measured at small time-scales and in high detail since coalescence measurements are decoupled from droplet formation. The microfluidic coalescence channel can be used as an analytical tool to gain better understanding of fluid interface stabilisation during emulsification, and to develop emulsion formulations ab initio. </p...|$|R

This evaluation included the calibration characteristics, precision and accuracy obtained, as well as the results of recovery studies. The emulsification method was found to be comparable to the ashing and dilution methods in terms of calibration and only Cr, Cu, Fe and Pb concentrations were found. The precision of the emulsification method was found, in general, to be close to or less than 2 % RSD. The used oil matrix also contained leaked petroleum from a problem car engine. An accurate determination of lead was consequently impossible since the high lead content led to sedimentation. The use of the internal standard, indium, was evaluated for its effectiveness in correcting possible matrix effects that were evident from the results obtained in the recovery studies. The recovery studies showed the Cr and Pb determinations to be adversely affected by internal standardization. An alternative approach for matrix effect correction, the common analyte internal standardization (CAIS) method was also investigated.

The <b>emulsions</b> displayed a good homogeneity (particle size below 1 _m and low phase separation), conductivity below 10 _S/cm and low antigen degradation at 4 ?C for up to 1 year. The efficacy of the different formulations was then evaluated during vaccination trials on goats. The inactivated ER antigens emulsified with ISA 70 and ISA 70 M in a homogenizer resulted in 80 % and 100 % survival rates, respectively. A cold-chain rupture assay using ISA 70 M+ER was performed to mimic possible field conditions exposing the vaccine at 37 ?C for 4 days before delivery. Surprisingly, the animal survival rate was still high (80 %). We also observed that the MAP- 1 B antibody response was very similar between animals vaccinated with ISA 70 +ER and ISA 70 M+ER emulsions, suggesting a more homogenous antigen distribution and presentation in these emulsions. Our work demonstrated {{that the combination of}} ISA 70 or ISA 70 M and homogenizer is optimal for the production of an effective ready-to-use inactivated vaccine against heartwater, which could easily be produced on an industrial scale.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{mechanical}} behavior of densely packed (up to ~ 30 % v/v), sedimented layers of (1 <b>m)</b> water-in-oil W/O <b>emulsion</b> droplets, upon indentation with a (10 m) large spherical probe. In {{the presence of}} attractive forces, the droplets form solid like networks which can resist deformation. Adding a polymer to the oil phase was used to control droplet attraction. The droplet layers were assembled via normal gravity settling. Considering that both the network structure and the droplet interactions play a key role, we used a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) to characterize the mechanical behavior. Here the AFM was used both as indentation tool and as force sensor. Indentation experiments were performed via a protocol consisting of approach, waiting, and retract stages. CSLM was used to observe the network structure at micron resolution in real time. Use of refractive index matched fluorescent droplets allowed the visualization of the entire layer. Upon compression with the probe, a markedly nonhomogeneous deformation occurred, evidenced by {{the formation of a}} dense corona (containing practically all of the displaced droplets) in the direct vicinity of the probe, as well as more subtle deformations of force-chains at larger distances. Upon decompression, both the imprint of the indenter and the corona remained, even long after the load was released. The force-distance curves recorded with the AFM correspond well to these observations. For each deformation cycle performed on fresh material, the retract curve was much steeper than the approach curve, thus corroborating the occurrence of irreversible compaction. Contrary to classic linear viscoelastic materials, this hysteresis did not show any dependence on the deformation speed. Our force-indentation approach curves were seen to scale roughly as F ~ 3 / 2. The pre-factor was found to increase with the polymer concentration and with the density of the network. These findings suggest that this new AFM-CSLM method could be used for rheological characterization of small volumes of "granular networks" in liquid. Our hypothesis that the mechanical resistance of the networks originates from interdroplet friction forces, which in turn are set by the interdroplet potential forces, is supported by the predictions from a new mechanical model in which the interdroplet bonds are represented by stick-slip elements...|$|R
40|$|Research {{under this}} Project has proven that {{liquid carbon dioxide}} can be {{emulsified}} in water by using very fine particles as emulsion stabilizers. Hydrophilic particles stabilize a CO{sub 2 }-in-H{sub 2 }O (C/W) emulsion; hydrophobic particles stabilize a H{sub 2 }O-in-CO{sub 2 } (W/C) emulsion. The C/W emulsion consists of tiny CO{sub 2 } droplets coated with hydrophilic particles dispersed in water. The W/C emulsion consists of tiny H{sub 2 }O droplets coated with hydrophobic particles dispersed in liquid carbon dioxide. The coated droplets are called globules. The emulsions {{could be used for}} deep ocean sequestration of CO{sub 2 }. Liquid CO{sub 2 } is sparsely soluble in water, and is less dense than seawater. If neat, liquid CO{sub 2 } were injected in the deep ocean, {{it is likely that the}} dispersed CO{sub 2 } droplets would buoy upward and flash into vapor before the droplets dissolve in seawater. The resulting vapor bubbles would re-emerge into the atmosphere. On the other hand, the emulsion is denser than seawater, hence the emulsion plume would sink toward greater depth from the injection point. For ocean sequestration a C/W emulsion appears to be most practical using limestone (CaCO{sub 3 }) particles of a few to ten ?m diameter as stabilizing agents. A mix of one volume of liquid CO{sub 2 } with two volumes of H{sub 2 }O, plus 0. 5 weight of pulverized limestone per weight of liquid CO{sub 2 } forms a stable emulsion with density 1087 kg m{sup - 3 }. Ambient seawater at 500 m depth has a density of approximately 1026 kg m{sup - 3 }, so the emulsion plume would sink by gravity while entraining ambient seawater till density equilibrium is reached. Limestone is abundant world-wide, and is relatively cheap. Furthermore, upon disintegration of the emulsion the CaCO{sub 3 } particles would partially buffer the carbonic acid that forms when CO{sub 2 } dissolves in seawater, alleviating some of the concerns of discharging CO{sub 2 } in the deep ocean. Laboratory experiments showed that the CaCO{sub 3 } emulsion is slightly alkaline, not acidic. We tested the release of the CO{sub 2 }-in-H{sub 2 }O emulsion stabilized by pulverized limestone in the DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory High Pressure Water Tunnel Facility (HPWTF). Digital photographs showed the sinking globules in the HPWTF, confirming the concept of releasing the emulsion in the deep ocean. We modeled the release of an emulsion from the CO{sub 2 } output of a 1000 MW coal-fired power plant at 500 <b>m</b> depth. The <b>emulsion</b> would typically sink several hundred meters before density equilibration with ambient seawater. The CO{sub 2 } globules would rain out from the equilibrated plume toward the ocean bottom where they would disintegrate due to wave action and bottom friction. Conceptual release systems are described both for an open ocean release and a sloping seabed release of the emulsion...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} was to develop a plant protein-based microcapsule capable of carrying, protecting and delivering flaxseed oil within the food and gastrointestinal environment. Specifically, the research aimed to: a) screen a variety of plant proteins and pre-treatment conditions based on their emulsifying properties for use as a wall material; b) develop and optimize encapsulation protocols for entrapping flaxseed oil; and c) study the oxidative stability and delivery of entrapped oils from capsules under different environmental and simulated gastrointestinal conditions. In Chapter 3 and 4, the emulsifying and physicochemical properties of legume and oilseed protein isolates, respectively produced from isoelectric precipitation and salt extraction were investigated. Findings in Chapter 3 indicated that both the legume source and method of production showed significant effects on the emulsifying and physicochemical properties of chickpea (ChPI), faba bean (FbPI), lentil (LPI), pea (PPI), and soy (SPI) protein isolates. The emulsion capacity (EC) values ranged between 476 - 542 g oil/g protein with LPI showing the highest capacity. Isoelectric-precipitated ChPI and LPI displayed higher emulsion activity index (EAI) (~ 46. 2 <b>m</b> 2 /g), (<b>emulsion</b> stability index) ESI (~ 84. 9 min) and (creaming stability) CS (98. 6 %), which were comparable to those of SPI. In Chapter 4, findings indicated that both protein source and method of production had significant effects on the physicochemical and emulsifying properties of canola (CaPI) and flaxseed protein isolates (FlPI). CaPI showed significantly higher EC (~ 515. 6 g oil/g protein) than FlPI (~ 498. 9 g oil/g protein). EAI for FlPI was found to be higher (~ 40. 1 m 2 /g) than CaPI (~ 25. 1 m 2 /g) however, ESI values of CaPI and FlPI were similar. Creaming stability of emulsions stabilized by CaPI and FlPI ranged between 86. 1 and 96. 6 %. CaPI and FlPI were shown to have emulsion forming properties; however their stability was low. In Chapter 5, ChPI and LPI-stabilized emulsions were optimized based on pH, protein concentration and oil content for their ability to form and stabilize oil-in-water emulsions using response surface methodology. Droplet charge was shown to be only affected by pH, while droplet size and creaming index were affected by protein concentration, oil content and pH. Optimum conditions for minimal creaming (no serum separation after 24 h), small droplet size (40 mV) were identified as: 4. 1 % protein, 40. 0 % oil, and pH 3. 0 or 8. 0, regardless of the plant protein used for emulsion preparation. Flaxseed oil was microencapsulated by freeze (Chapter 6) or spray (Chapter 7) drying employing ChPI or LPI and maltodextrin. Effects of emulsion formulation (oil, protein and maltodextrin levels) and protein source (ChPI vs. LPI) on the physicochemical characteristics, oxidative stability, and release properties of the resulting capsules were investigated. Optimized capsule designs were found to have high encapsulation efficiencies, low surface oil, and afforded protection against oxidation over a 25 d room temperature storage study relative to free oil. Microcapsules were also able to deliver 84. 2 % of the encapsulated oil in the simulated gastrointestinal environments...|$|R
40|$|A terapia fotodinâmica (TFD) utilizando ácido 5 -aminolevulinico (ALA) e derivados em aplicação tópica e, como {{precursor}} da protoporfirina IX (PPIX) apresenta alguns limitantes relativos a baixa permeação das substâncias na pele. Comportamento este que afeta a produção e homogeneidade da distribuição da PPIX na superfície e camadas mais profundas da pele. Para resolver essa limitação muitos autores propõem alternativas modificando a molécula do ALA e derivados, bem como modificando as propriedades químicas da fase externa da emulsão (mais hidrofílica ou hidrofóbica) ou então o sistema de entrega para a emulsão. O objetivo desse estudo é avaliar qual a proporção de ALA e metil- 5 -aminolevulinato (MAL) que quando misturados levam ao aumento da quantidade e uniformidade da formação da PPIX na superfície e em profundidade na pele. Para esse estudo foi realizada análises de fluorescência e histologia. O estudo foi conduzido in vivo e ex vivo usando biópsias de pele de porco cultivadas {{in vitro}}. A produção de PPIX foi monitorada utilizando espectroscopia de fluorescência, imagem de fluorescência de campo amplo e microscopia confocal de fluorescência. E para a aplicação da TFD os parâmetros usados foram de 125 mW/cm 2 de intensidade e 150 J/cm 2 de dose. A análise do dano causado pela irradiação foi realizada por meio de histologia da pele após 24 e 48 horas da aplicação da TFD. O ALA e MAL na concentração de 20 % foram misturados nas seguintes proporções: ALA ou M, M 2 (80 % ALA - 20 % MAL), M 3 (60 % ALA 40 % MAL), M 4 (50 % ALA MAL), M 5 (40 % ALA 60 % MAL), M 6 (20 % ALA 80 % MAL) e MAL como M 7. As diferentes proporções foram incorporadas em emulsões óleo em água (O/A) e água em óleo (A/O). De acordo com os resultados, as misturas M 3, M 4 e M 5 mostraram maior produção de PPIX na superfície da pele segundo as medidas de fluorescência em 3 h de incubação e, no estudo da cinética mostraram produzir PPIX em menor tempo. No estudo de permeação do creme in vitro em pele ex vivo, por microscopia confocal de fluorescência, observou-se que as misturas M 3, M 4 e M 5 produziram mais PPIX nas camadas da pele do que ALA e MAL. As análises histológicas das misturas apresentaram maior dano fotodinâmico na superfície e profundidade das camadas da pele após a TFD, independente da emulsão. A análise em até 48 h observou-se predominantemente a fase do processo de reparo referente à fase inflamatória, mas existem indícios ao longo das análises tanto macroscópicas e histológicas que o processo de reparo referente as fases subsequentes de proliferação e remodelamento estão iniciando-se em paralelo. A mistura M 4 em ambas as emulsões apresentou elevada quantidade de formação de PPIX em menor tempo de incubação. M 4 em emulsão O/A apresentou menor dano fotodinâmico já que a evolução do processo reparo foi mais rápida sugerindo-se potencial de aplicação em TFD voltado para área cosmética-estética. Já M 4 em emulsão A/O levou a um maior dano fotodinâmico já que a evolução do processo de reparo foi mais lenta sugerindo-se potencial de aplicação em TFD voltado para área oncológica e de doenças de pele. De modo geral o estudo proposto apresentou impacto positivo para a otimização da terapia fotodinâmica em aplicação tópica. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using 5 -aminolevulinic acid and derivatives on topical application {{and as a}} precursor of protoporphyrin (PPIX) has some limitations for low permeation of substances into the skin. This behavior affects PPIX production and homogeneous distribution {{on the surface and}} deeper layers of the skin. To resolve this limitation, many authors propose alternatives such as modifying the molecule of ALA and its derivatives, as well as changing the chemical properties of the external phase of the emulsion (more hydrophilic or hydrophobic) or the delivery system to the emulsion. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the proportion of ALA and methyl- 5 -aminolevulinate (MAL) that when mixed leads to an increase in the amount and uniformity of the PPIX formation on surface and deep skin. For this study we performed fluorescence analysis and histology. The studies were conducted in vivo and also using pig skin biopsies (ex vivo) cultured in vitro. The PPIX production was monitored using fluorescence spectroscopy, widefield fluorescence imaging, and fluorescence confocal microscopy. For the application of PDT an intensity of 125 mW/cm 2 and a dose 150 J/cm 2 were used. Analysis of the damage caused by irradiation was performed through skin histology after 24 and 48 hours after PDT application. ALA and MAL in concentration of 20 % were mixed in the following proportions: ALA or M, M 2 (80 % ALA - 20 % MAL), M 3 (60 % ALA - 40 % MAL), M 4 (50 % ALA - MAL) M 5 (40 % ALA - 60 % MAL), M 6 (20 % ALA - 80 % MAL) MAL and as M 7. Different proportions were incorporated in oil-in-water emulsions (O/W) and water-in-oil (W/O). The fluorescence measurements for 3 h of incubation showed better PPIX production in the skin surface for mixtures M 3, M 4 and M 5. Moreover, the kinetics study showed PPIX production in less time for these mixtures. In the study of cream permeation of ex vivo skin in vitro by confocal fluorescence microscopy, we observed that the mixtures M 3, M 4 and M 5 produced more PPIX in the skin layers than ALA and MAL. The histological analyses of the mixtures showed higher photodynamic damage on the surface and deeper layers of the skin after PDT, independent of the emulsion. The analysis in 48 hours predominantly observed the phase of the healing process regarding the inflammatory phase but there are signs along both macroscopic and histological analysis that the healing process concerning the subsequent stages of proliferation and remodeling are initiating in parallel. The mixture M 4 in both emulsions had high amounts of PPIX formation in shorter incubation time. <b>M</b> 4 <b>emulsion</b> O/A showed a lower photodynamic damage since the evolution of the healing process was faster suggesting to potential application in PDT facing cosmetic-aesthetic area. M 4 already in W/O emulsion led to a greater photodynamic damage since the evolution of the healing process was slower suggesting to potential application in PDT facing oncology and skin diseases. Overall the proposed study had a positive impact on the optimization of photodynamic therapy for topical application...|$|R
