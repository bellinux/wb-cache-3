5|$|Freedom to <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> {{throughout}} {{the territory of}} India though reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right {{in the interest of}} the general public, for example, restrictions may be imposed on movement and travelling, so as to control epidemics.|$|E
5|$|Aerophones, {{which produce}} a sound with a {{vibrating}} column of air; they {{are sorted into}} free aerophones such as a bullroarer or whip, which <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> through the air; flutes, which cause the air to pass over a sharp edge; reed instruments, which use a vibrating reed; and lip-vibrated aerophones such as trumpets, for which the lips themselves function as vibrating reeds.|$|E
5|$|To prevent injuries, boulderers {{position}} crash pads {{near the}} boulder {{to provide a}} softer landing, {{as well as one}} or more spotters to help redirect the climber towards the pads. Upon landing, boulderers employ falling techniques similar to those used in gymnastics: spreading the impact across the entire body to avoid bone fractures, and positioning limbs to allow joints to <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> throughout the impact.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Moving</b> <b>freely</b> {{vertically}} and horizontally without obstruction {{is the way}} {{of outsiders}} and the nightmare army.|$|R
50|$|Vesicle <b>moves</b> <b>freely</b> in the lumen {{and during}} the time is {{degraded}} by hydrolases (ec. Atg15p). Nutrients are then released by Atg22p.|$|R
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Jumping Flash! 2 {{is virtually}} identical to its predecessor; {{the game is}} presented in a first-person perspective, and the player can <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> in three-dimensional world and rotate the camera in any direction. The user interface resembles much {{of the characteristics of}} its predecessor; the top part of the screen shows the time remaining, the player's score, and one of four of Robbit's AI sidekicks who offers the player warnings, reminders and hints.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving employs {{non-linear}} storytelling, {{forcing the}} player {{to piece together}} the narrative. During gameplay, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects. The player has little control over the game mechanics and is only able to <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> and pick up objects as needed to progress. Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.|$|E
5|$|While Osborn {{lies in the}} morgue, it is {{revealed}} that the goblin formula gave him a previously-unknown healing factor which restores him to life; {{in the process of}} sneaking out, he kills someone with a similar physique to himself to feign his death. No longer suffering from bouts of amnesia, Norman escapes to Europe, where he can <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> and unnoticed. During this time abroad, believed dead by the general public, he orchestrates several plots, including replacing Aunt May with a genetically altered actress, and faking his own son's death.|$|E
50|$|The {{sculpture}} {{is a large}} swirling abstract {{that consists}} of 8 bronze pieces painted black and placed on a pole. It <b>moves</b> <b>freely.</b>|$|R
50|$|Acupuncture is {{an ancient}} form of {{medicine}} using small filiform needles placed at predetermined points on the body. The goal of acupuncture is to move Qi—the force that makes us alive. Western medicine has no equivocal term to describe Qi. Qi flows throughout the body along meridians, or paths that interconnect the external {{surface of the body}} with the internal organs. When needles are placed in points, Qi <b>moves</b> <b>freely.</b> As Qi <b>moves</b> <b>freely,</b> the body maintains its balance, or homeostasis.|$|R
50|$|Ruth Gilbert always {{shows as}} a traditionalist poet who <b>moves</b> <b>freely</b> and comfortably within formalism, notably lyrical and melodious, usually {{dramatic}} and narrative, rarely explicitly confessional.|$|R
5|$|A male {{sea otter}} {{is most likely}} to mate if he {{maintains}} a breeding territory in an area that is also favored by females. As autumn is the peak breeding season in most areas, males typically defend their territory only from spring to autumn. During this time, males patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other males, although actual fighting is rare. Adult females <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> between male territories, where they outnumber adult males by an average of five to one. Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.|$|E
5|$|A rigid {{structure}} {{called the}} plica mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the back, {{down the center of}} the sublingua to give it support. The plica mediana is usually made of cartilage and attaches the sublingua to the underside of the tongue. In lemuriforms, the sublingua mostly consists of two plicae fimbriatae (singular: plica fimbriata), which run along the sides of the plica mediana and end in comb-like serrated edges that are hardened with keratin. The plicae fimbriatae <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> over a limited range. The plica sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, attaches the tongue and sublingua to the floor of the mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E
5|$|For the {{hand-held}} camera footage, Soderbergh used Panavision Millennium XLs {{that were}} smaller and lighter than previous cameras and {{allowed him to}} <b>move</b> <b>freely.</b> In order to tell the three stories apart, he adopted a distinctive look for each. For Robert Wakefield's story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel. For Helena Ayala's story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film, overexposing it for a warmer feel. For Javier Rodriguez's story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feel. Then, he took the entire film through an Ektachrome step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly. He wanted to have different looks for each story because the audience had {{to keep track of}} many characters and absorb a lot of information and he did not want them to have to figure out which story they were watching.|$|E
60|$|Woot {{seized the}} oil-can and did this, {{but all the}} others helped wiggle the soldier's joints {{as soon as they}} were oiled, until they <b>moved</b> <b>freely.</b>|$|R
50|$|According to old {{historical}} records, Armenian {{warriors and}} traders once <b>moved</b> <b>freely</b> {{in many parts}} of Central Asia, often fighting alongside local warlords in return for trading privileges.|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times called Hunting:Gathering [...] "a {{work that}} <b>moves</b> <b>freely</b> among African rhythmic and melodic shapes, {{contemporary}} Western harmonies and tone-shaping techniques, and distorted glimpses of Haydnesque Classicism." ...|$|R
5|$|Outer {{space is}} the closest known {{approximation}} to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets and moons to <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> along their ideal orbits. However, even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter. The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, {{is an important factor}} in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Players {{take control}} of Nier—a middle-aged man in Nier and Nier Gestalt and a teenaged boy in Nier Replicant—though the {{character}} can be renamed by the player. The player directly controls Nier through a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the characters, which allows for a 360° view of the surroundings. The three-dimensional world is divided into areas separated by loading screens, and the player can <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> throughout these areas by walking, running, jumping, and climbing ladders. In some rooms and buildings, the camera swings {{to the side and}} Nier is restricted to moving as in a two-dimensional platforming environment, while during certain battles the camera pulls up to simulate a top-down shoot 'em up or other video game genres.|$|E
5|$|Although {{skeptical of}} New World Order conspiracism, {{political}} scientist David Rothkopf argues, in the 2008 book , {{that the world}} population of 6 billion people is governed by an elite of 6,000 individuals. Until the late 20th century, governments of the great powers provided most of the superclass, accompanied by a few heads of international movements (i.e., the Pope of the Catholic Church) and entrepreneurs (Rothschilds, Rockefellers). According to Rothkopf, in the early 21st century, economic clout—fueled by the explosive expansion of international trade, travel and communication—rules; the nation-state's power has diminished shrinking politicians to minority power broker status; leaders in international business, finance and the defense industry not only dominate the superclass, they <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> into high positions in their nations' governments and back to private life largely beyond the notice of elected legislatures (including the U.S. Congress), which remain abysmally ignorant of affairs beyond their borders. He asserts that the superclass' disproportionate influence over national policy is constructive but always self-interested, and that across the world, few object to corruption and oppressive governments provided they can do business in these countries.|$|E

5000|$|With the Indiana State Police after them, {{the gang}} hid out in Chicago, with Dillinger, Pierpont, Mary Kinder and Billie Frechette sharing a flat at 4310 Clarendon Avenue. [...] The gang <b>moved</b> <b>freely</b> about Chicago.|$|R
5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{the construction of}} a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it was more common for the villages nearby to have grown {{as a result of the}} presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle. The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confined to Europe. When the 13th-century Safad Castle was founded in Galilee in the Holy Land, the 260villages benefitted from the inhabitants' newfound ability to <b>move</b> <b>freely.</b> When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local landscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord. Settlements could also grow naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of proximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importance– perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration– the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement depopulated.|$|E
5|$|King William {{appears to}} have left the {{initiative}} for Stigand's deposition to the papacy, and did nothing to hinder Stigand's authority until the papal legates arrived in England to depose the archbishop and reform the English Church. Besides witnessing charters and consecrating Remigius, Stigand {{appears to have}} been a member of the royal council, and able to <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> about the country. But after the arrival of the legates, William did nothing to protect Stigand from deposition, and the archbishop later accused the king of acting with bad faith. Stigand may even have been surprised that the legates wished him deposed. It was probably the death of Ealdred in 1069 that moved the pope to send the legates, as that left only one archbishop in England; and he was not considered legitimate and unable to consecrate bishops. The historian George Garnett draws the parallel between the treatment of King Harold in Domesday Book, where he is essentially ignored as king, and Stigand's treatment after his deposition, where his time as archbishop is as much as possible treated as not occurring.|$|E
5|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, weighing 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated {{into the top of}} the frame. A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch, after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The revolver is double-action only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can <b>move</b> <b>freely,</b> an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E

His seminar discussions <b>moved</b> <b>freely</b> across {{the breadth of the}} humanities and social sciences, including history, philosophy, law, political theory, social theory, pure economic theory, literature, medicine, and psychiatry.|$|R
50|$|A bail handle, {{or simply}} bail, is a handle that {{consists}} of an open loop that <b>moves</b> <b>freely</b> within two fixed mounts. It {{may be used for}} carrying an item, such as a bucket or kettle, or as a drawer pull.|$|R
5|$|Zito {{wanted to}} put {{together}} some demos to present the technology to Hasbro. Riley wanted {{to create an environment}} the player could <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> about, leading to the idea of surveillance cameras. Fulop and Riley were inspired by the play Tamara (1981) which ran parallel stories running in 13 different rooms. The audience would need to decide for themselves which stories they wanted to follow. Fulop and Riley watched the play three times {{over the course of a}} weekend in 1985. Fulop and Riley liked the design model and thought it would make a good basis for an interactive media experience. A prototype game titled Scene of the Crime was produced to demonstrate the new technology to Hasbro and test the surveillance camera gameplay. It was a short five-minute demo where the player follows suspicious characters around a house to find who stole a stash of money. The player switches between cameras to observe the characters and eavesdrop on their conversations; all the characters have a plot to steal the money. At the end of the game, the player must guess who stole the money. In December 1986, the team flew to Hasbro headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and pitched the technology to Hasbro CEO Stephen Hassenfeld and a board room of 22 executives who liked the system and gave funding to support further development for the technology and games.|$|E

50|$|At {{this time}} in history the {{division}} between haute couture and ready-to-wear was not sharply defined. The two separate modes of production were still far from being competitors and they often co-existed in houses where the seamstresses <b>moved</b> <b>freely</b> between made-to-measure and ready-made.|$|R

50|$|Each player {{starts the}} game with four shrimps. When placed on a coral, the shrimp claims the coral for that player and protects {{adjacent}} tiles (but not necessarily the entire coral) from being overgrown. Shrimp may be <b>moved</b> <b>freely</b> around the boards during a player's turn.|$|R
