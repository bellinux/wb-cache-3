50|$|Plymell {{subsequently}} {{earned a}} bit of immortality in the underground press by publishing only the first printing of Robert Crumb's Zap Comix #1, which Don Donahue took over from Plymell when he purchased his <b>Multilith</b> 1250 printing press soon after.|$|E
50|$|Founded in 1978 by Nick West and E.A. Srere, Sluggo! {{began as}} a tabloid-sized photocopied publication, and evolved into a quintessential DIY publication. The first issue {{appeared}} in December 1978. With the donation of a <b>Multilith</b> 1250 offset press {{and an array of}} colored inks, Sluggo! acquired its distinctive multi-colored, multi-faceted appearance. Sluggo! look was also defined by its unique covers - hand-crafted on some issues, individually silk-screened on black velvet on the finale.|$|E

Dick Company, <b>Multilith,</b> and the Chief and Davidson lines made by A.T.F.-Davidson. Offset duplicators are made for fast and quick printing jobs; printing up to 12,000 impressions per hour.

50|$|Before {{releasing}} the 914, Xerox tested {{the market by}} introducing a developed version of the prototype hand-operated equipment known as the Flat-plate 1385. The 1385 was not actually a viable copier because of its speed of operation. As a consequence, it was sold as a platemaker to the offset lithography market, perhaps most notably as a platemaker for the Addressograph-Multigraph <b>Multilith</b> 1250 and related sheet-fed offset printing presses. It {{was little more than}} a high quality, commercially available plate camera mounted as a horizontal rostrum camera, complete with photo-flood lighting and timer. The glass film/plate had been replaced with a selenium-coated aluminum plate. Clever electrics turned this into a quick developing and reusable substitute for film. A skilled user could produce fast, paper and metal printing plates of a higher quality than almost any other method. Having started as a supplier to the offset lithography duplicating industry, Xerox now set its sights on capturing some of offset's market share.|$|E
