This paper examines {{the retention of}} elemental and isotopic sedimentary signatures in an industrialised estuarine system subject to a strongly upward sea-level trend, over a 20 year period. Two contrasting salt marsh sites (at Hythe and Hamble, part of the wider Southampton Water estuarine system, UK) were examined, which had been previously cored and analysed in the early 1990 s. Much of the geochemical record of recent anthropogenic activity has been eroded and lost at the Hamble site. In contrast, radiometric, isotopic and elemental records of anthropogenic activity have been retained in the Hythe marsh, with 137 Cs and Cu depth profiles showing retention of input maxima related to fallout and local industrial discharges, respectively. Stable Pb isotope data show a broad degree of correspondence in cores analysed in 1994 and 2014 when plotted against sediment (radiometric) age, indicating the usefulness of isotopic data in retaining information on Pb sources and in disentangling <b>Pb</b> <b>input</b> histories.

The {{analytical}} methods to detect free FBs in maize and derived products usually involve extraction with aqueous methanol and/or acetonitrile; for hidden FBs, alkaline hydrolysis (2 MKOH) and following CH 3 CN extraction is used. Recently, we proposed a simple phosphate buffer (PB) extraction to detect free FBs in masa and maize samples. This study aimed at evaluating if this method is suitable to detect also hidden FBs; then, a comparison between the most common solvents, PB, and alkaline hydrolysis was carried out. For maize samples, {{the results showed that}} 0. 4 <b>M</b> <b>PB</b> can extract both free and most hidden FBs; however, this method was not suitable for some categories of maize-based processed food products, in particular cornflakes, chips, and crispbreads.

The use of immunoassays {{for the detection of}} microcystins is vulnerable to matrix components and other interferents. This study is an evaluation of the effects of interfering substances commonly found in drinking and ambient water samples using commercially-available immunoassay kits for microcystin toxins. The microplate and strip test immunoassay formats were tested in the study. For the microplate ELISA, the following were found to inhibit microcystin-LR (MC-LR) detection: 250 μg/mL Ca 2 + or Mg 2 +, 0. 01 % ascorbic acid, 0. 1 % EDTA chelating agent, 0. 05 M glycine-HCl, pH 3. The following exhibited no effect: sodium chloride (NaCl, 1 % to 4 %) and sodium thiosulfate (0. 001 % and 0. 01 %), 0. 01 to 0. 1 <b>M</b> phosphate buffers (<b>PB),</b> pH 7 and 0. 067 <b>M</b> <b>PB</b> at pH 5, 6, 7 and 8. Overall, up to 50 μg/mL of standard and reference natural organic matter (NOM) from various sources did not interfere in the assay system (without MC-LR) but diminished the detection of MC-LR at varying degrees. This is the first study evaluating standard and reference humic and fulvic acids from various sources in immunoassays for microcystins. The strip test also showed variable effects on MC-LR detection in the presence of NOM. This assay format was also sensitive to varying pHs and ionic strengths. MC-LR binding was inhibited at low pH (0. 05 M glycine-HCl, pH 3), whereas, 0. 067 <b>M</b> <b>PB</b> with pH 6, 7 and 8 can yield false positive results. Lower ionic strength of 0. 01 <b>M</b> <b>PB,</b> pH 7 showed no interference in MC-LR binding whereas higher ionic strengths can interfere with MC-LR detection. NaCl at 3 % and 4 % can interfere with the analysis giving false positive results.

While the regional phaseout of leaded petrol commenced in 2000, coral Pb/Ca continued increasing until 2004, possibly due to regional upwelling and the transport of previously emitted Pb from tropical Pacific waters. The [superscript 206]Pb/[superscript 207]Pb ratio in the coral was 1. 191 – 1. 195 before mid- 1950 s, suggesting natural sources. Since then, the ratio decreased, reaching ~ 1. 165 in 2004.

In this thesis study, first, a method was developed {{for the analysis of}} dissolved Pb and other trace elements in seawater using single batch nitrilotriacetate resin extraction and isotope dilution ICP-MS, which was applied in analyzing seawater Pb concentrations {{in the rest of the}} study. A - 550 year history of the Pb and Pb isotopes in the deep North Atlantic Ocean is reconstructed using a deep-sea coral, showing the infiltration of anthropogenic Pb to deep sea. Comparing the results to the surface North Atlantic Ocean Pb record using a Transit Time Distribution model, the mean transit time of Pb is estimated to be - 64 years. This is longer than the transit time estimate assuming simple advection from a source, showing the importance of advective-diffusive mixing in the transport of Pb to the ocean interior. The later part of the thesis investigates Pb in the Indian Ocean, where no useful Pb data have been previously reported. First, using annually-banded surface growing corals, I reconstruct variations of Pb and isotopes in the surface waters of the central and eastern Indian Oceans during the past half-century. Results of the study show the increase of Pb concentrations from the mid- 1970 s, and major sources of the Pb are discussed, including leaded gasoline and coal burning, based on their emission histories and Pb isotope signatures. Second, Pb concentration and isotope profiles are presented from the northern and western Indian Oceans.

A significant export of Pb from the soil contaminant pool is indicated in two of the lakes surrounded by near-shore permafrost soils. Here, levels of Pb contaminants and (206) Pb/(207) Pb ratios of sediments deposited after the 1970 s appear not to have been strongly affected by the >/= 90 % reduction in atmospheric deposition rates and increasing (206) Pb/(207) Pb ratios of atmospheric Pb since the 1990 s. We concluded that soil processes stimulated by the ongoing climate change at high latitudes might work counteractive to efforts to reduce contaminant levels in subarctic lakes...|$|R

Developmentally regulated expression of NMDA receptor sub-units may underlie the changing sensitivity to Pb. In oocytes expressing in vitro transcribed cRNAs for 1 #{ 128 } 1 or 1 #{ 128 } 2 NMDA receptor subunits, Pb inhibited glutamate-activated currents with IC 50 values of 0. 87 ± 0. 25 and 1. 21 ± 0. 22 tiM, respec-tively, and NMDA-activated currents with IC 50 values of 1. 37 ± 0. 47 and 1. 1 1 ± 0. 33. tM, respectively. In oocytes expressing 1 #{ 128 } 1 #{ 128 } 2 subunits, the IC 50 values for Pb blockade of NMDA-or glutamate-activated currents were significantly larger when compared to 1 #{ 128 } 1 or 1 #{ 128 } 2 combinations. Pb concentrations greater than 1 pM inhibited glutamate-activated currents with an IC 50 of 6. 1 ± 1. 22 jiM and NMDA-activated currents with an IC 50 of 6. 64 ± 3. 34 p. <b>M.</b> <b>Pb</b> reduced the maximal curren...|$|R

Further the result is used for a lattice version of the Dido problem. MSC 1991 : 52 C 05, 11 H 06 1. Introduction and Results For a plane lattice-point-free convex region with area A and perimeter P Bender [1] proved the relation A P ! 1 2 : This result has been generalized in different ways. There are complete solutions for the generalization to higher dimensions [4] and to arbitrary lattices for d = 2 [9]. Further there are results for convex bodies containing {{a certain number of}} lattice points ([2],[7],[8]). The work has been partially supported by Consejeria de Cultura y Educacion de la C. A.
