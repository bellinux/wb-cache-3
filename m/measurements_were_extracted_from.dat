40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} literature to evaluate the clinical outcome of cochlear implantation for patients with single-sided deafness (SSD) or asymmetrical hearing loss (AHL). DATA SOURCES: We searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL databases from their inception up to December 10, 2013 for SSD or AHL and cochlear implantation or their synonyms. STUDY SELECTION: In total, 781 articles were retrieved, of which 15 satisfied the eligibility criteria. Our outcomes of interest were speech perception in noise, sound localization, quality of life (QoL), and tinnitus. DATA EXTRACTION: Critical appraisal showed that six studies reported on less than five patients or that they carried a low directness of evidence or a high risk of bias. Therefore, we extracted the data of nine studies (n = 112). Patient numbers, age, duration of deafness, classification of deafness, pure tone audiometry, follow-up duration, and outcome <b>measurements</b> <b>were</b> <b>extracted</b> <b>from</b> all nine articles.

From 205 trials included, 6158 different measurements of 100 different outcome domains were reported, with a median of 22 domains per trial (IQR 13 - 41). Overall, 52 domains (52 %) were surrogate, 38 (38 %) were clinical, and 10 (10 %) were patient-reported. The 5 most commonly reported domains were blood pressure (76 [37 %] trials), relapse/remission (70 [34 %]), kidney function (66 [32 %]), infection (61 [30 %]), and height/pubertal development (51 [25 %]).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of an educational lifestyle modification (LM) intervention on blood pressure (BP) among adults with prehypertension. Prehypertension is a precursor to hypertension (HTN) and is a public epidemic in the United States. Approximately 68 million (31 %) U. S. adult’s aged ≥ 18 years have hypertension. Hypertension can cause significant target organ damage, lead to coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and kidney failure. Early identification and the primary treatment of persons with prehypertension with LM have the potential to minimize the progression and delay the onset of comorbidities associated with hypertension. This quality improvement project retrospectively reviewed changes in blood pressure for a small sample (n= 5) of patients diagnosed with prehypertension who received education about modifying lifestyle behaviors according to nationally accepted clinical practice guidelines.

40|$|In example-based human pose estimation, the {{configuration}} of an evolving object is sought given visual evidence, having to rely uniquely {{on a set of}} sample images. We assume here that, at each time instant of a training session, a number of feature <b>measurements</b> <b>is</b> <b>extracted</b> <b>from</b> the available images, while ground truth is provided {{in the form of the}} true object pose. In this scenario, a sensible approach consists in learning maps from features to poses, using the information provided by the training set. In particular, multi-valued mappings linking feature values to set of training poses can be constructed. To this purpose we propose a Belief Modeling Regression (BMR) approach in which a probability measure on any individual feature space maps to a convex set of probabilities on the set of training poses, in a form of a belief function. Given a test image, its feature measurements translate into a collection of belief functions on the set of training poses which, when combined, yield there an entire family of probability distributions. From the latter either a single central pose estimate or a set of extremal ones can be computed, together with a measure of how reliable the estimate is. Contrarily to other competing models, in BMR the sparsity of the training samples can be taken into account to model the level of uncertainty associated with these estimates. We illustrate BMR’s performance in an application to human pose recovery, showing how it outperforms our implementation of both Relevant Vector Machine and Gaussian Process Regression. Finally, we discuss motivation and advantages of the proposed approach with respect to its most direct competitors...|$|R

Normalized mean curves then were constructed for each of these three types. 	Ten cases appeared to involve multiple, overlapping cells, including two cases of long duration thunderstorm rainfall. These ten events were excluded from the results listed below. 	The average of the 65 single cell cases produced about 5 mm of rain in about 5. 5 min, with an average maximum rainfall rate of about 110 mm/hr.

The impedance peak at 3 *frev indicates incorrect parking of the idle cavities, and explains the observed instability of mode 3. Bunch synchrotron tunes are calculated from lorentzian ts to the data. Bunch-to-bunch tune variation due to the cavity transient isshown to be large enough to result in Landau damping of coupled bunch modes...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{software}} {{available to}} date for analyzing image sequences from time-lapse microscopy works only for certain bacteria and under limited conditions. These programs, mostly MATLAB-based, fail for microbes with irregular shape, indistinct cell division sites, or that grow in closely packed microcolonies. Unfortunately, many organisms of interest have these characteristics, and analyzing their image sequences {{has been limited}} to time consuming manual processing. Results Here we describe BactImAS – a modular, multi- platform, open- source, Java-based software delivered both as a standalone program and as a plugin for Icy. The software <b>is</b> designed for <b>extracting</b> and visualizing quantitative data from bacterial time- lapse movies. BactImAS uses a semi- automated approach where the user defines initial cells, identifies cell division events, and, if necessary, manually corrects cell segmentation {{with the help of}} user-friendly GUI and incorporated ImageJ application. The program segments and tracks cells using a newly-developed algorithm designed for movies with difficult-to- segment cells that exhibit small frame-to-frame differences. <b>Measurements</b> <b>are</b> <b>extracted</b> <b>from</b> images in a configurable, automated fashion and an SQLite database is used to store, retrieve, and exchange all acquired data. Finally, the BactImAS can generate configurable lineage tree visualizations and export data as CSV files. We tested BactImAS on time-lapse movies of Mycobacterium smegmatis and achieved at least 10 - fold reduction of processing time compared to manual analysis. We illustrate the power of the visualization tool by showing heterogeneity of both icl expression and cell growth atop of a lineage tree. Conclusions The presented software simplifies quantitative analysis of time-lapse movies overall and is currently the only available software for the analysis of mycobacteria-like cells. It will be of interest to the community of both end-users and developers of time-lapse microscopy software...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the generic {{value of a}} rigorous analysis of spike shapes observed in nanoimpact experiments. To this end, we investigate the electrochemical doping of insoluble nanoparticles impacting on a biased electrode surface and develop an analytical model of the doping process is developed that accounts for the diffusion of ions inside nanoparticles {{as well as a}} numerical model for the response characteristics of the analogue measurement circuitry. By this means, spike shapes that are experimentally observed in the electrode current are predicted and directly compared with experimental data, while appropriate fitting procedures allow detailed physical insights into the ionic mass transport within the particle. Using the oxidative doping of ferrocene nanoparticles with tetrafluoroborate anions as a paradigm case, we demonstrate that size distributions of particle populations showing excellent agreement with scanning electron microscopy <b>measurements</b> can <b>be</b> <b>extracted</b> <b>from</b> experimental data and ionic diffusion inside the particle can be quantified...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a modeling system that constructs 3 D models of particular object classes, such as cups, airplanes, and fish, from 2 D sketches. The {{core of the}} system is a sketch recognition algorithm that seeks to match the points and curves of a set of given 2 D templates to the sketch. The matching process employs an optimization metric that is based on curve feature vectors. The search space of possible correspondences is restricted by encoding knowledge about relative part locations into the 2 D template. Once a best-fit template is found, a 3 D object is constructed using a series of <b>measurements</b> that <b>are</b> <b>extracted</b> <b>from</b> the labelled 2 D sketch. The sketch-recognition and modeling algorithms are applied to sketches of cups and mugs, airplanes, and fish. The system allows non-experts to use drawings to quickly create 3 D models of specific object classes...|$|R
