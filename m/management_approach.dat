40|$|While most {{theory and}} {{research}} on acquisitions assumes the importance of how acquisitions are managed, little research has specifically addressed the topic of post-acquisition management. This study is intended as an exploratory attempt {{to address this problem}} by identifying the <b>management</b> <b>approaches</b> used by acquiring firms. ^ Data on post-acquisition changes were collected from fifty-one firms, using structured questionnaires. Additional data were collected from senior acquiring firm executives through structured interviews. <b>Management</b> <b>approaches</b> were identified through nonhierarchical cluster analysis. Associations between <b>management</b> <b>approaches</b> and planning, outcome, and performance variables were identified using analysis of variance procedures. ^ Results indicated four <b>management</b> <b>approaches.</b> The first was an autonomous approach, characterized by little change. The second was a decentralized approach, characterized by immediate structural and executive changes, coupled with a delegation of decision making to acquired firm managers. The third approach was characterized by centralization of decision making in acquiring firm managers, coupled with extensive structural and control changes. Finally, the fourth approach was bureaucratic, characterized by increases in rules, regulations, and controls, but few other changes. These four approaches can be seen as generic approaches to the problem of control versus delegation in new subsidiaries. ^ <b>Management</b> <b>approaches</b> were strongly associated with acquisition outcome and performance variables. Specifically, extensive changes in acquired firms were associated with poor performance to objectives. Similarly, changes were positively associated with management conflicts, length of transition, and turnover. ^ <b>Management</b> <b>approaches</b> were not strongly associated with pre-acquisition variables. These included the goals for which an acquisition was made, the formality of acquiring firm planning processes, and the concerns addressed by the acquiring firm in planning for transition. ^ These results are somewhat consistent with views that stress the complexity of post-acquisition management processes, as well as their importance for acquisition performance. They also suggest that the interests of managers and workers in acquisitions both suggest similar <b>management</b> <b>approaches.</b> Improved prescriptions for post-acquisition management are possible, but they need to be less linear and more sensitive to the complexity of transitional processes. ...|$|R

25|$|When {{protecting}} the coastline {{it is important}} to understand the how the sedimentary budget can be affected when implementing appropriate coastal protecting techniques. Often management plans for coastal erosion have seen the use of ‘hard’ engineering structures as a means of {{protecting the}} coastline from recession. In particular groynes which are used to trap the longshore drift of sediment that often deprives a beach. Groynes have the ability to change the coast's sediment budget, accreting up drift beaches but at the same time starving down drift beaches. This <b>management</b> <b>approach</b> is not used so much these days, with modern knowledge of coastal dynamics promoting the use of ‘soft’, natural approaches such as nourishment and preservation of natural systems such as dunes.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} impact of leadership and <b>management</b> <b>approaches</b> on the delivery of excellence in social care. It focuses on four residential care homes with nursing, operated by a national Third Sector provider of services for disabled people. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate how services defined quality and to examine the extent to which leadership and <b>management</b> <b>approaches</b> facilitated staff engagement in quality improvement and contributed to 'Good' or 'Excellent' Care Quality Commission ratings. This multi-method, qualitative study was underpinned by a phenomenological research philosophy. Data collected from semi-structured interviews with managers and care supervisors was triangulated through the analysis of opinion data from rating questionnaires completed by frontline nursing, care staff and non-care staff. Data was analysed using methods adapted from Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The study did not establish a clear association between leadership and <b>management</b> <b>approaches</b> and the achievement of a 'Good' or 'Excellent' CQC rating. The collaborating organisation's comprehensive operational policy framework and ethos of service user empowerment appeared to be higher determinants of service quality than leadership and <b>management</b> <b>approaches.</b> However, findings did indicate that, where leadership and <b>management</b> <b>approaches</b> help followers to feel valued and psychologically safe, managers can engage staff successfully in the quality improvement process. An unexpected outcome of the study was that it identified a possibility that an individual's leadership and <b>management</b> <b>approaches</b> may change when they are highly stressed, causing a negative impact on their followers, the working environment and the service culture. It was beyond the scope of this research to take forward an exploration of these issues. However, it provides the opportunity for further research to examine the ways in which managers respond to high stress levels, how followers are affected when managers are overly stressed and the overall implications for staff welfare and service quality in the social care context...|$|R

25|$|While WSS {{improvements}} were ongoing, {{the traditional}} water <b>management</b> <b>approach</b> did {{not account for}} domestic and industrial wastewater treatment and non-point sources pollution control resulting in the environmental degradation of water bodies. These systems were viewed as separate and the management strategy did not account for treatment facilities, local streams, and overall water quality within them. The philosophy is evolving however, and water resources management practice is becoming more of an integrated approach taking into account a multi-sectoral approach looking at water supply, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), drainage and irrigation as one entity. According to pollution control work presented {{by a team of}} researchers at the British Hydrological Society symposium in 2008, {{there is a need to}} consider the sewer system, the WWTP, and the river as one system.
