5|$|Abundant {{in eastern}} Australia, M. nigrocincta ants prefer {{temperate}} bushlands, {{and are usually}} located in dry to semi-dry forests and sclerophyll woodlands. The species {{is found in the}} eastern states of Australia, <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> the coastal plains where much suitable dry forest habitat can be found. They prefer tropical climates and warm temperatures. They can also be found in other types of habitat at elevations ranging from 80 - 1,220 metres (262ft - 4,000ft).|$|E
5|$|Balzac uses meticulous, {{abundant}} {{detail to}} describe the Maison Vauquer, its inhabitants, and the world around them; this technique gave rise to his title {{as the father of}} the realist novel. The details focus <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> the penury of the residents of the Maison Vauquer. Much less intricate are the descriptions of wealthier homes; Madame de Beauséant's rooms are given scant attention, and the Nucingen family lives in a house sketched in the briefest detail.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{research}} on findings made there, the lake did support a substantial population that relied <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> {{resources from the}} lake, including aquaculture and fishing. Estimated populations range from 20,000 to 100,000 people. When the lake dried up, the inhabitants switched to other economic activities. Agriculture did not {{play a major role}} in food supply.|$|E
5|$|By the team's {{following}} season, Adamle {{was being}} used <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> defense as a left-side linebacker, and Motley was again the primary fullback. Cleveland had a perfect season in 1948, winning all of its games and beating the Buffalo Bills in the championship. Adamle had 88 rushing {{yards and a touchdown}} that year.|$|E
5|$|In nearby Pohnpei state, Chataan {{produced}} 72km/h (45mph) winds in Nukuoro. The winds {{destroyed a}} house and a weather station. Rainfall on the atoll reached 457mm (18.0in). High winds, surf, and rain also affected Sapwuafik. Rough seas killed a person on Pohnpei. Crop damage in the country totaled $3million, and overall property damage was estimated at $100million, <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> Chuuk.|$|E

5|$|Late in the war, the {{provisional}} government existed <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> paper. However, {{in the summer}} of 1864, Colonel R. A. Alston of the Ninth Tennessee Cavalry requested Governor Hawes' assistance in investigating crimes allegedly committed by Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan during his latest raid into Kentucky. Hawes never had to act on the request, however, as Morgan was suspended from command on August 10 and killed by Union troops on September 4, 1864.|$|E
5|$|No. 460 was {{the last}} of the E6s model to be built, {{out of a total of}} 80 locomotives. From their {{construction}} in 1914 until 1920, the E6s ran <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> the corridor between New York City and Washington, D.C. After being replaced by the K4s model, the E6s locomotives were relegated to charter services because of their high speed.|$|E
5|$|Other {{political}} stations {{include the}} likes of Galaxy FM, founded in the early 1980s and gaining a strong audience by the late 80's after becoming consistent reliable station broadcasting <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> Fridays, weekends and Monday mornings. Galaxy FM did attempt to broadcast 24 hours on the FM briefly and did advertise for a short time, before returning to broadcasting <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> Fridays, weekends and Monday mornings after 1992 with no profit making adverts. It was not until June 2012 Galaxy FM attempted to broadcast 24 hours {{a day on the}} FM again and deliberately continued to not use profit making advertisements to maintain the station. However, in late September/early October 2012 due to constant attacks from the authorities the station {{decided to go back to}} its original schedule, this time with an additional day and a half of broadcasting per week; broadcasting on the FM from Thursday afternoons until Monday afternoons. Galaxy FM encourages the black population to liberate themselves through empowerment and self-reliance.|$|E

5|$|Overall, Hurricane Inez killed about 1,000people, <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> Hispaniola, {{and caused}} over $200million in damage. Crop damage {{was less than}} other storms of similar magnitude, due to Inez's small size and its {{occurrence}} late in the season.|$|E
5|$|Seasonal work in {{agriculture}} had depended <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> Bretons and mainland Normans from the 19th century. The growth of tourism attracted staff from the United Kingdom. Following liberation in 1945, agricultural workers were mostly {{recruited from the}} United Kingdom – the demands of reconstruction in mainland Normandy and Brittany employed domestic labour.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies {{resemble}} spiraling pinwheels.

5|$|Styracosaurs were herbivorous dinosaurs; they {{probably}} fed <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> low growth {{because of the}} position of the head. They may, however, have been able to knock down taller plants with their horns, beak, and bulk. The jaws were tipped with a deep, narrow beak, believed to have been better at grasping and plucking than biting.|$|E
5|$|Tadpoles are {{typically}} herbivorous, feeding <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> algae, including diatoms filtered {{from the water}} through the gills. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles, and fish. The Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) {{is one of a}} number of species in which the tadpoles can be cannibalistic. Tadpoles that develop legs early may be eaten by the others, so late developers may have better long-term survival prospects.|$|E
5|$|The Army took {{full control}} over the OSRD's {{research}} and development contracts as they lapsed.

Bush and Conant continued to influence the Manhattan Project through participation in the MPC.|$|E

5|$|The Mary Rose was {{substantially}} rebuilt in 1536. The 1536 rebuilding {{turned a}} ship of 500 tons {{into one of}} 700 tons, and added an entire extra tier of broadside guns to the old carrack-style structure. By consequence, modern research is based <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> interpretations of the concrete physical evidence of {{this version of the}} Mary Rose. The construction of the original design from 1509 is less known.|$|E
