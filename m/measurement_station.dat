They only operated for two seasons, which about thirty patrons per year, losing money both years. The Norwegian Polar Institute established a scientific station in the town in 1966, and they moved an ionosphere <b>measurement</b> <b>station</b> from Isfjord Radio to Ny-Ålesund and stationed two staff there. Kings Bays operations {{during the second half}} of the 1960s was minimal, typically sending two men for guard and maintenance each summer. By 1968 there were 31 people working at the telemetry station. The Polar Institute increased its activity in Ny-Ålesund from 1968, although its winter population was limited to one. Kings Bay carried out work to secure its mining claims in its area, but it needed exemption if it was to succeed at keeping the claims, which would variously be canceled between 1966 and 1970.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the relative and absolute reliability of ultrasound (US) measurements of the thickness and echogenicity of the plantar fascia (PF) at different <b>measurement</b> <b>stations</b> along its length using a standardized protocol. Twelve healthy subjects (24 feet) were enrolled. The PF was imaged in the longitudinal plane. Subjects were assessed twice to evaluate the intra-rater reliability. A quantitative evaluation of the thickness and echogenicity of the plantar fascia was performed using Image J, a digital image analysis and viewer software. A sonography evaluation of the thickness and echogenicity of the PF showed a high relative reliability with an Intra class correlation coefficient of ≥ 0. 88 at all <b>measurement</b> <b>stations.</b> However, the <b>measurement</b> <b>stations</b> for both the PF thickness and echogenicity which showed the highest intraclass correlation coefficient (ICCs) {{did not have the}} highest absolute reliability. Compared to other <b>measurement</b> <b>stations,</b> measuring the PF thickness at 3 cm distal and the echogenicity at a region of interest 1 cm to 2 cm distal from its insertion at the medial calcaneal tubercle showed the highest absolute reliability with the least systematic bias and random error. Also, the reliability was higher using a mean of three measurements compared to one measurement. To reduce discrepancies in the interpretation of the thickness and echogenicity measurements of the PF, the absolute reliability of the different <b>measurement</b> <b>stations</b> should be considered in clinical practice and research rather than the relative reliability with the ICC...|$|R

The inspectors are present from 25 to 50 {{percent of the}} working days in the Melox MOX Fuel Fabrication Plant and the La Hague Reprocessing Plant. The installed independent EURATOM <b>measurement</b> <b>stations</b> assure continuous <b>measurements</b> allowing the inspectors to verify 100 percent of the nuclear material flow across critical points in those facilities. For security reasons, access to these measurement points is usually very restricted. The reliability and high availability of these <b>measurement</b> <b>stations</b> is thus of high significance. Some of them were continuously operating for over 20 years without major maintenance before the upgrade discussed in this paper. Six unattended <b>measurement</b> <b>stations,</b> consisting of neutron coincidence collars and electromechanically cooled high purity Germanium detectors have been modernized recently. The reliability of the automated data acquisition system has been significantly improved. The availability of the data transmission networks was improved at the same time.
