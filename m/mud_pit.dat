5|$|Homer and Bart {{set out for}} help, {{unaware that}} Maggie is tagging along, while Marge and Lisa stay behind. Separated from Homer and Bart, Maggie is soon adopted by a family of bears. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart plummet into a raging river where they lose their clothes, but hide their nakedness with leaves and mud. Marge and Lisa make {{themselves}} comfortable by a campfire, while the boys freeze in the wilderness. The next day, Homer tries to steal honey from a beehive, only to be attacked by the bees, but evades them by jumping into a <b>mud</b> <b>pit.</b> A nature photographer takes a picture of Homer covered in mud, mistaking him for Bigfoot, and soon the forest is inundated with Bigfoot enthusiasts and reward seekers.|$|E
500|$|On June 5, 1799, Asa Danforth Jr. began {{construction}} eastward from Toronto {{on a road}} {{which was}} to extend the Governor's Road through Port Hope and to the Trent River. That road, completed in 1801, would be described by acting surveyor general William Chewett to be [...] "good" [...] {{for use in the}} dead of winter but [...] "impassible" [...] during the wet summers, when the path turned to a bottomless <b>mud</b> <b>pit.</b> It would be extended in 1802 to reach the Bay of Quinte at Stone Mills (now Glenora) and a ferry crossing established to Adolphustown. The Bath extension of the Danforth Road (1802) provided access to a key early colonial road, the Bath Road, which had long joined Bath to Kingston.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the scenes}} shot for [...] "Schizogeny" [...] were filmed on a real orchard named Hazelgrove Farms near {{the small town of}} Fort Langley, British Columbia. Other shots, mostly {{involving}} the sinking mud scenes, were shot on a soundstage at Lion's Gate Studios that was fitted with over 200 hazelnut trees. The <b>mud</b> <b>pit</b> was made out of a large tank filled with peat moss, mud, and water. The mixture was heated so that the actors would not be uncomfortable during the sinking scenes. The shot that called for Karin Matthews' lifeless body to sink into the mud required a stunt woman to be slowly lowered into the pit. The crew found it necessary to supply her oxygen during the shot because of the depth of the pit. Toby Lindala and her art department created all of the props used in the episode, including the moving tree roots and the skeletal remains of Karin Matthews' father.|$|E

5000|$|On a {{drilling}} rig, mud is pumped from the <b>mud</b> <b>pits</b> through the drill string where it sprays out of nozzles on the drill bit, cleaning and cooling the drill {{bit in the}} process. The mud then carries the crushed or cut rock ("cuttings") up the annular space ("annulus") between the drill string and {{the sides of the}} hole being drilled, up through the surface casing, where it emerges back at the surface. Cuttings are then filtered out with either a shale shaker, or the newer shale conveyor technology, and the mud returns to the <b>mud</b> <b>pits.</b> The <b>mud</b> <b>pits</b> let the drilled [...] "fines" [...] settle; the pits are also where the fluid is treated by adding chemicals and other substances.|$|R

500|$|The tour {{included}} a set at Woodstock '94 broadcast on Pay-per-view and seen {{in as many}} as 24million homes. The band being covered in mud was a result of pre-concert backstage play, contrary to the belief that it was an attention-grabbing ploy, thus making it difficult for Reznor to navigate the stage: Reznor pushed Lohner into the <b>mud</b> <b>pit</b> as the concert began and saw mud from his hair entering his eyes while performing. Nine Inch Nails was widely proclaimed to have [...] "stolen the show" [...] from its popular contemporaries, mostly classic rock bands, and its fan base expanded. The band received considerable mainstream success thereafter, performing with significantly higher production values and the addition of various theatrical visual elements. Its performance of [...] "Happiness in Slavery" [...] from the Woodstock concert earned the group a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1995. Entertainment Weekly commented about the band's Woodstock '94 performance: [...] "Reznor unstrings rock to its horrifying, melodramatic core—an experience as draining as it is exhilarating". Despite this acclaim, Reznor attributed his dislike of the concert to its technical difficulties.|$|E
500|$|In the strike-shortened 1982 season, the Jets {{finished}} 6–3 {{and upset}} the Cincinnati Bengals {{in the first}} round of the playoffs, as running back Freeman McNeil became the second player to rush for 200 yards in a postseason game. New York then defeated the top seeded Los Angeles Raiders 17–14, based on the strong performances of McNeil and Wesley Walker in a game that saw numerous turnovers on both sides. The Jets next traveled to face the Miami Dolphins in the AFC Championship Game. The game was preceded by a series of storms that turned the Orange Bowl into a <b>mud</b> <b>pit.</b> The Dolphins stated that they did not own a tarpaulin, and that stadium maintenance was Dade County's responsibility, so the field lay exposed to the elements. The muddy field slowed the Jets' offense. In what was dubbed the [...] "Mud Bowl", neither team managed much offense (both teams gained less than 200 yards). At the end of his best season, Todd threw five interceptions, the last being a screen pass deflected and returned by linebacker A. J. Duhe for a costly 4th-quarter touchdown as New York fell to Miami 14–0. On February 9, 1983, Michaels announced his resignation, and the following day the Jets elevated offensive coordinator Joe Walton to the head coaching position.|$|E
500|$|A live-action trailer titled The Life {{was posted}} on the Internet in September and later used in {{television}} spots {{as part of the}} promotional material released for the game. Filmed at several locations in Budapest, Hungary, The Life follows an ODST named Tarkov from a military funeral where he is inspired to become a soldier, through training and combat and up to the moment he becomes a leader in battle. [...] The short film was created by advertising agency TAG SF with effects by Asylum, and directed by production company MJZ, who also handled the award-winning Halo 3 [...] "Believe" [...] advertisement. Legacy Effects designed and fabricated props, weapons, armor, and a Covenant Brute costume within two weeks. Bungie supplied 3D geometry that allowed the company to quickly create accurate representations of in-game items, and provided input on the UNSC dress uniforms. The initial cemetery scene was filmed inside the cooling tower of an active nuclear power plant in Budapest, and outside the tower the production team created a <b>mud</b> <b>pit</b> and obstacle course to simulate basic training. Members of the Hungarian special forces served as drill instructors in the training sequence, firing blanks. Finally, filming moved to an abandoned Soviet-era aluminum refinery for the short's final memorial scene. An additional scene was shot there, but did not appear in the final product.|$|E

2500|$|Next {{year the}} 1921 Golden Bears also {{finished}} undefeated and were again invited {{to play in}} the Rose Bowl. Smith initially declined this invitation because he thought it was problematic that Cal's opponent, a little known team named the Washington and Jefferson Presidents, had players better than the average college, {{and at the same time}} had scholarship requirements well below California's. Eventually Smith agreed to the match. With California being the overwhelming favorite, the match went nothing like it was expected. Because of the heavy rain the night before, it was played in a virtual <b>mud</b> <b>pit.</b> Both defenses were able to hold off their opponents and the game finished in a 0–0 tie. This Rose Bowl was Smith's last.|$|E

The CAU consists of 14 Corrective Action Sites (CASs) located in Areas 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, and 25 of the Nevada Test Site (NTS). All of the CASs are found within Yucca Flat except CAS 25 - 15 - 01 (Waste Dump). Corrective Action Site 25 - 15 - 01 is found in Area 25 in Jackass Flat. Of the 14 CASs in CAU 357, 11 are <b>mud</b> <b>pits,</b> suspected <b>mud</b> <b>pits,</b> or <b>mud</b> processing-related sites, which are by-products of drilling activities in support of the underground nuclear weapons testing done on the NTS. Of the remaining CASs, one CAS is a waste dump, one CAS contains scattered lead bricks, and one CAS has a building associated with Project 31. 2. All 14 of the CASs are inactive and abandoned. Clean closure with no further action of CAU 357 will be completed if no contaminants are detected above preliminary action levels. A closure report will be prepared and submitted to the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection for review and approval upon completion of the field activities.
