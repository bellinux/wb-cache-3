500|$|In {{articles}} providing updates {{about the}} sculpture's status, The Oregonian called the work [...] "larger-than-life style highway art" [...] and [...] "Twilight Zone Bambi". Angela Webber of the Daily Journal of Commerce expressed {{her love for}} the sculpture and disappointment in the public's reaction. She wrote, [...] "This <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> sad. [...] Apparently, this giant baby-faced deer statue isn't pretty enough for Milwaukie. [...] I imagine the folks of Milwaukie just don't get it." ...|$|E
500|$|Burton {{personalized}} {{the film}} with several cameos. While filming in Alabama, the crew tracked down Billy Redden, {{one of the}} original banjo players from Deliverance (1972). Redden was working as a part-owner of a restaurant in Clayton, Georgia, and he agreed to reprise his role in the Spectre vignette. As Edward Bloom first enters the town, Redden can be seen on a porch plucking a few notes from [...] "Dueling Banjos". Burton was pleased with the result: [...] "If you're watching the film and don't recognise the solitary, enigmatic figure on the porch, that's fine. But if you do – well, it just <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> happy to see him and I think other people will feel the same way." [...] Original Big Fish author Daniel Wallace makes a brief appearance as Sandra's economics teacher in the [...] "Courtship of Sandra Templeton" [...] scene.|$|E
500|$|On January 26, 2017, Disney {{announced}} that Groban had recorded {{a cover of}} [...] "Evermore" [...] – still entitled [...] "For Evermore", at the time – and revealed that his version would be included on the remake's soundtrack {{in addition to being}} played during the film's end credits. Groban released a statement, saying: [...] "I am honored to sing this beautiful new song by two of my absolute favorites, Alan Menken and Tim Rice. Beauty and the Beast has been with me since my childhood and to have a musical connection to this new film <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> happy." [...] The announcement coincided with the studio's release of a new promotional poster for the film, which Disney allowed the singer to premiere using his official Twitter account. A 30-second sample of the track was uploaded to SoundCloud on February 14, 2017, which Groban also shared on Twitter. Groban's version was released as the second single from Beauty and the Beasts soundtrack on March 3, 2017, several days before the album, on which Stevens' original rendition appears, was released. Groban promoted the song with a performance on Good Morning America on March 14, 2017. The occasion marked both the song's first televised performance, as well as the first time an original song from the remake was performed live on television.|$|E
