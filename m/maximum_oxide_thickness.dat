40|$|The {{origin of}} {{sustained}} current oscillations at the Si electrolyte contact {{is not fully}} understood. Oscillatory functions are regarded which describe the oscillating oxide thickness at the silicon electrode. We consider an initially vanishing two dimensional time dependent function which oscillates between a minimum and a <b>maximum</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> at each location of the electrode. The function is continuous except at single points of the electrode at which the oxide thickness drops deeply due {{to the formation of}} nanopores in the oxide. The oscillatory function is represented by a set of infinite infinitesimal oscillators. The mathematical model is {{based on the fact that}} it is sufficient to register the oscillators only one time per i th cycle at their minimum or when the phase of the oscillator equals i 2 amp; 960;. In phase space representation, the passing of the phase trough the i 2 amp; 960; planes leads to oscillator density functions pi t which define the differential number of oscillators passing their minimum at the i th time at the time t. Two consecutive oscillator density functions are connected by an integral equation representing a Markov process. Together with a local model for the oxide microstructure, a fit of the model parameter to the measured current is possible. The result is that the existence of two types of oxides with different nanopore densities can explain sustained current oscillations and, further, it is possible to calculate the mean nanopore distance in both types of oxid...|$|E
40|$|Investigations of sputtering, {{electron}} emission and oxide growth under 40 - 300 keV H+, He+, N+, Ne+, Ar+, Kr+ and Xe+ ion bombardment of SiO 2 {{are presented in}} this thesis. To accurately determine SiO 2 sputtering yields, a new measurement method was developed where the {{electron emission}} was monitored during sputtering through thin SiO 2 films on Si substrates. Sputtering yields were thereby determined both in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and during exposure to O 2, N 2 and CO. The UHV sputtering yield was found not to be proportional to the energy deposited in elastic collisions at an SiO 2 surface and therefore {{it is suggested that}} SiO 2 sputtering is controlled by a mixed collisional-electronic mechanism. The sputtering of SiO 2 films was found to decrease by up to 50 % with increasing O 2 partial pressure but no dependence on N 2 or CO partial pressure was observed. The reduction in sputtering at O 2 exposure is larger the smaller the ion mass and it is argued that {{this may be due to}} mass dependent preferential sputtering of oxygen and/or ion stimulated incorporation of oxygen in the surface layers. The ion induced electron yield of SiO 2 films on Si was measured as a function of oxide thickness, ion mass, ion energy and angle of ion incidence. For oxide films thicker than 200], the electron yield was found to be approximately independent of oxide thickness, but close to the SiO 2 /Si interface unexpected variations in the electron yield with oxide thickness were found. Furthermore, it was found that the electron yield of a thick oxide increased with the energy deposited in electronic excitations approximately to the power of 0. 65 and not to the power of 1 as expected from theory. A satisfactory interpretation of the data could be obtained with a suggested model where the positive holes, left behind in the oxide by the liberated electrons within electron cascades of individual ions, cause the probability of escape of electrons to decrease with increasing electron yield. For the first time, it was observed that a 40 keV N+ ion beam could induce oxidation of Si at room temperature if the bombardment is performed in oxygen at low pressure. It was noted that the attainable oxide thickness increases with increasing availability of oxygen on the target surface. The <b>maximum</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> produced is estimated to be in the range 50 - 100] and, from XPS measurements, it is also concluded that the oxide formed is stoichiometric SiO 2.

This work has concentrated on isolating one of these variables, the <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness,</b> and measuring {{the effect of the}} <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> on uranium hydride nucleation. Uranium samples, all from the same lot, were prepared with different <b>oxide</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> The <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> was measured using Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy.

The time to nucleate a hydride was found to increase whereas the maximum hydriding rate was found to decrease with increasing <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness.</b> The density of hydride pits also decreased with increasing <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness.</b> The observed results support the argument that the nucleation of hydride is controlled somewhat by diffusion of hydrogen through the oxide layer. Vacuum outgassing of samples, thereby removing the oxide impurities and keeping the <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> constant, dramatically decreased the nucleation time and increased the maximum hydriding rate. Again, this is consistent with hydrogen diffusion through the oxide controlling the nucleation of hydride.

40|$|This paper, {{based on}} {{two-dimensional}} simulations, provides a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} electrical characteristics of the Silicon germanium (SiGe) -base bipolar transistors on thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates. The impact of the buried <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> (T(OX)), the emitter width (W(E)), and the lateral distance between {{the edge of the}} intrinsic base and the reach-through region (L(col)) on both the AC and DC device characteristics was analyzed in detail. Regarding the DC characteristics, the simulation results suggest that a thicker T(OX) gives a larger base-collector breakdown voltage (BV(CEO)), whereas reducing the T(OX) leads to an enhanced maximum electric field at the B-C junction. As for the AC characteristics, cut-off frequency (f(T)) increases slightly with increasing buried <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> and finally saturates to a constant value when the buried <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> is about 0. 15 mu m. The collector-substrate capacitance (C(CS)) decreases with increasing buried <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> while the <b>maximum</b> oscillation frequency (f(max)) increases with increasing buried <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness.</b> Furthermore, the impact of self-heating effects in the device was analyzed in various areas.

40|$|There {{are only}} few methods {{available}} for predicting {{the age of}} cracks that are found in high temperature structural components during service; among the promising ones is the <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> measurement technique. <b>Oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> profiles are taken from crack surfaces of components and used for predicting the rates of crack propagation. This technique is particularly suitable for high temperature components fabricated from ferritic steels commonly used in power plants that run on fossil fuels.

In this study, the oxidation characteristics of an American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Grade P 91 ferritic steel used in high temperature piping is characterized.

Initially, the <b>oxide</b> <b>thickness</b> increases in a linear fashion with time and then as steady-state conditions are established, the parabolic relationship takes over. Multiple types of oxides with different rate characteristics can also form. Oxide degradation can occur by spallation due to porosity and formation of cracks.
