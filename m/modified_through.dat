Burlington House was constructed between 1664–5 by John Denham, but was sold two years later to Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington who asked Hugh May to complete it. The house was extensively <b>modified</b> <b>through</b> the 18th century, and {{is the only one of}} this era to survive into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} protons and {{neutrons}} in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies {{because of the}} strong force. Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, {{at the core of}} the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into a single nucleus. Nuclear fission is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be <b>modified</b> <b>through</b> bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.|$|E
5|$|The {{system was}} {{published}} in 1960 {{as a result of}} an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the metre–kilogram–second system of units (MKS) rather than any variant of the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS). SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are <b>modified</b> <b>through</b> international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 24th and 25th General Conferences on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 2011 and 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram, linking it to an invariant of nature rather than to the mass of a material artefact, thereby ensuring long-term stability.|$|E

According to the Constitution of Pakistan, the President has [...] "powers, subject to Supreme Court {{approval}} or veto, to dissolve the National Assembly, triggering new elections, and thereby dismissing the Prime Minister". These powers were repeatedly <b>modified</b> <b>through</b> amendments to the constitution, which were introduced as the results of military coups and changes in government. Since the 18th Amendment to the Constitution was passed in 2010, Pakistan has been shifted back from semi-presidential to a parliamentary democratic republic. Under that system, the president has limited ruling powers, and performs ceremonial duties while the Prime Minister enjoys more powers to execute decisions. The president is chosen by the Electoral College composed of the Senate, the National Assembly and the Provincial Assemblies.|$|E

The lyrics and theme of the song {{are similar to those of}} Part I, with Serena Kim of The Washington Post describing it as [...] "mighty pressure coming from...male voices to persuade one woman to succumb to spontaneous sex", while Beyoncé portrays herself as a [...] "hesitant but willing" [...] voice of reason. Wayne's lyrics, <b>modified</b> <b>through</b> the use of a vocoder to make him sound intoxicated, are wily seductions to have his love interest have intercourse with him in the club's bathroom.

2500|$|Skinner's {{behavioral}} {{theory was}} largely {{set forth in}} his first book, Behavior of Organisms. Here he gave a systematic description of {{the manner in which}} environmental variables control behavior. He distinguished two sorts of behavior—respondent and operant—which are controlled in different ways. [...] Respondent behaviors are elicited by stimuli, and may be <b>modified</b> <b>through</b> respondent conditioning, which is often called [...] "Pavlovian conditioning" [...] or [...] "classical conditioning", in which a neutral stimulus is paired with an eliciting stimulus. Operant behaviors, in contrast, are [...] "emitted", meaning that initially they are not induced by any particular stimulus. They are strengthened through operant conditioning, sometimes called [...] "instrumental conditioning", in which the occurrence of a response yields a reinforcer. Respondent behaviors might be measured by their latency or strength, operant behaviors by their rate. Both of these sorts of behavior had already been studied experimentally, for example, respondents by Pavlov, and operants by Thorndike. Skinner's account differed in some ways from earlier ones, {{and was one of the}} first accounts to bring them under one roof.|$|E

The curve transformation is performed using the interpolation of the quantities involved in this propagation equation.
