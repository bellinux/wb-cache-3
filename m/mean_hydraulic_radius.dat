The ratio of vertical and horizontal permeability is important when reservoir anisotropy (Kv/Kh) and heterogeneity cannot be neglected. Therefore, an accurate knowledge of vertical and lateral permeability distribution is essential for better reservoir characterization. This work uses routine core data for analysis to develop new correlations and characterization of a sandstone reservoir under development. The two main goals {{of this study are}} to use core data to (1) develop correlations capable of predicting vertical permeability from horizontal permeability or <b>mean</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>radius</b> and (2) develop another correlation capable of predicting the permeability anisotropy ratio (Kv/Kh) using effective porosity data. To accomplish the objectives of this project, various petrophysical properties were experimentally measured for 112 core samples extracted from an actual sandstone reservoir.

40|$|International audienceNumerical {{programs}} for simulating flow and reactive transport in porous media are essential tools for predicting reservoir properties changes triggered by CO 2 underground injection. At reservoir scale, meshed models in which equations are solved assuming that constant macroscopic properties {{can be defined}} in each cells, are widely used. However, the parameterization of the dissolution-precipitation problem and of the feedback effects of these processes on the flow field is still challenging. The problem arises from the mismatch between the scales at which averaged parameters are defined in the meshed model and the scale at which chemical reactions occur and modify the pore network geometry. In this paper we investigate the links between the dissolution mechanisms that control the porosity changes and the related changes of the reactive surface area and of the permeability. First, the reactive surface area is computed from X-ray microtomography data obtained before and after a set of dissolution experiments of pure calcite rock samples using distinctly different brine-CO 2 mixtures characterizing homogeneous to heterogeneous dissolution regimes. The results are used to validate the power law empirical model relating the reactive surface area to porosity proposed by Luquot and Gauze (2009). Second, we investigate the spatial distribution of the effective <b>hydraulic</b> <b>radius</b> and of the tortuosity, two structural parameters that control permeability, in order to explain the different porosity-permeability relationships observed for heterogeneous and homogeneous dissolution regimes. It is shown that the increase of permeability {{is due to the}} decrease of the tortuosity for homogeneous dissolution, whereas it is due to the combination of tortuosity decrease and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>radius</b> increase for heterogeneous dissolution.

The decay rate of labeled activity at the injection site was studied with a gamma camera placed either in the anteroposterior (AP) or laterolateral (LL) projection. In breathing animals (respiratory frequency approximately 10 cycles/min), 10 min after the injection the activity decreased by approximately 50 % on AP and approximately 20 % on LL imaging; in apneic animals the corresponding decrease in activity was reduced to approximately 15 and approximately 3 %, respectively. We considered label translocation from AP and LL imaging as a result of bulk flows of liquid along the costomediastinal and gravity-dependent direction, respectively. We related intrapleural flows to the hydraulic pressure gradients existing along these two directions and to the geometry of the pleural space.

Capillary pressure results showed the presence of characterized pore throat size distribution and hence capillary pressure-derived parameters for samples of each formation. PDF showed that samples of Kareem Fm. have better reservoir flow properties (permeability) in contrast to those of Rudeis Fm. which have tight reservoir flow properties. In addition, petrographical study through thin sections and scanning electron microscope displayed the presence of two facies which are feldspathic quartz wacke (sandstone facies) of Kareem Fm. and bioclastic sandy wackestone (calcareous facies) of Rudeis Fm.

Using direct numerical simulations of single-phase, isothermal, laminar fluid flow through realistic three-dimensional stochastically generated pore structures, hereafter referred to as pore spaces, {{the characteristics of the}} resulting steady state velocity fields are related to physical characteristics of the pore spaces. The results suggest that the spatially variable resistance offered by the geometry and topology of the pore space induces a highly heterogeneous fluid velocity field therein. Focus is placed on three different length scales: macroscopic (cm), mesoscopic (mm), and microscopic (microns). At the macroscopic length scale, volume averaging is used to relate porosity, <b>mean</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>radius,</b> and their product to the permeability of the pore space. At the mesoscopic scale, the effect of a medium's porosity on fluid particle trajectory attributes, such as passage time and tortuosity, is studied.

As {{an alternative to}} fabrics, which generally provide higher in-place properties, CFMs are often employed as low cost, 'lofty' (high uncompressed thickness, and therefore good specific flexural stiffness), easy to process reinforcements for Resin Transfer Moulded (RTM) parts. Within this project, investigation of permeability measurement has involved the development of two (radial and linear) liquid flow permeability techniques to provide a reliable and robust data set for a specific CFM (Unifilo U 813 - 300). Then two novel (radial and linear) airflow techniques were developed for the measurement of CFMs, these providing comparative results with the liquid flow measurements. The benefits of airflow versus liquid flow include cleaner, lower pressured flow using a fluid that may be produced by compressor rather than stored, therefore having significant benefits for both laboratory and industrial measurements of permeability. Material characterisation is necessary to analytically investigate reinforcement materials, as permeability has a non-linear relationship with overall porosity. Permeability is therefore considered {{as a function of}} pore distribution, which encompasses the two scales of intra and inter fibre-bundle flow. Two areas have been investigated, these involving permeability measurement and microstructure characterisation. Comparative permeability measurements of a second CFM (Unifilo U 850 - 300), consisting of a different arrangement of fibre bundle sizes, were undertaken using the 1 D airflow method, and inter-laminar flow was investigated using the radial airflow method. These resulted in a permeability ratio of between 0. 54 and 0. 64 (U 813 /U 850) across a 0. 1 to 0. 3 fibre volume fraction range for the two CFMs, and no significant inter-laminar pore space effect. Microstructural characterisation initiated with image analysis of electron micrographs, providing measurement of fibre diameters and intra-bundle porosity. Kozeny-Carman modelling then showed the permeability of intra-bundle areas to be insignificant resulting in a focus on inter-bundle flow. Although limited by assumptions made for various material parameters, semi-empirical models to provide inter-bundle porosity and fibre bundle geometries were developed. Relation with permeability was then achieved through calculating hydraulic radius and <b>mean</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>radius</b> and provision of a range of Kozeny constants (0. 55 to 6. 17) and coefficients to replace the Kozeny constant, which provide upper and lower bounds for the remaining factors of permeability.

Includes bibliographical references: p. 82 - 84 Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Two methodologies have been applied for evaluating formation permeability using log and core data. One methodology is based on a modified Kozeny-Carmen equation and the concept of <b>mean</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>radius.</b> The other methodology involves a permeability correlation as a function of porosity and grain diameter based on systematic packing. These two methodologies have been used to determine a permeability profile in the Misoa Formation, Venezuela. Formation permeability controls the strategies involving well completion, well stimulation and reservoir management. The tools we normally use to estimate values of permeability are logs, cores, well tests and production data. One can also use seismic data to assist in computing the permeability distribution between the wells. The most economic method to evaluate formation permeability will usually be from well logs. In this research, we used logs and special core analyses to determine the permeability correlation in a specific reservoir located in the VLE- 196 area of Block V in Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela. The VLE- 1 96 area has production from the B, C 2, C 3, C 4 and C 5 reservoirs. The data from logs, cores, well tests and production are plentiful, but these data have never been correlated in an effort to compute the permeability distribution. Knowledge of the permeability distribution in the "C" sand reservoirs in the VLE- 196 area would be of significant benefit to the operating company, P. D. V. S. A. In this research, I applied and compared the Amaefule et aL and Berg methodologies with the standard regression method for correlating permeability. I used log and special core data from two wells, VLE 1063 and VLE 677, in the VLE- 1 96 area. The final step was to propose the best permeability correlation in the C- 4 and C- 5 sands in the VLE- 1 96 area.
