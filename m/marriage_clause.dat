50|$|Peter {{consolidated}} Portugal's independence {{with the}} signing of the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668, putting the Portuguese Restoration War, that began in 1640, to an end. He formed an alliance with England and had its decisive support based on <b>marriage</b> <b>clauses</b> that united Charles II of England with his sister Catherine of Braganza in 1661. Portugal ceded Tangier and Bombay, and compromised to transfer to the English the majority of the places recovered from the Dutch, to share in half the commerce of cinnamon, to install English families with the same privileges of the Portuguese families in Goa, Cochin, Diu, Bahia, Pernambuco and Rio de Janeiro. In exchange, England would give Lisbon military support, protecting Portuguese shipments in the Mediterranean and the coasts of Lisbon and Porto.|$|R

"Before {{the death}} of the maid, King Edward had {{proposed}} a marriage between her and his young son, and his ambassadors met the Scottish commissioners at Brigham, near Kelso, and on the 18th of July, 1290, the treaty was concluded. It contained, besides the provisions of the <b>marriage,</b> <b>clauses</b> for the personal freedom of Margaret should she survive her husband; for the reversion of the crown failing her issue; for protection of the rights, laws, and liberties of Scotland; the freedom of the church; the privileges of crown vassals; the independence of the courts; the preservation of all charters and natural muniments; and the holding of parliaments only within Scotland; and specially provided that no vassal should be compelled to go forth of Scotland for the purpose of performing homage or fealty; and that no native of Scotland should for any cause whatever be compelled to answer, for any breach of covenant or from crime committed, out of the kingdom.|$|R

5000|$|The theatre {{was built}} under the {{direction}} of Arthur S. Friend, a New York movie studio attorney, who was a partner in Famous Players-Lasky, a movie distribution company that became Paramount Pictures Corporation. Named after Walter Garde, a Hartford and New London businessman, the Garde Theatre opened on September 22, 1926, with the silent film The <b>Marriage</b> <b>Clause</b> starring matinee idols Francis X. Bushman (1883-1966) and Billie Dove (1903-1997). The Garde was hailed by the press of that time [...] "one of the finest theatres in New England." [...] Typical of the era, the theatre was a stage for Vaudeville as well as film. Variety acts of music, comedy, acrobats and magic, were interspersed between the showing of feature films, comedy shorts, and newsreels.|$|E
50|$|Fazakerley entered {{parliament}} as an adherent of the Tory party; {{he was a}} Jacobite of the cautious type. He was {{listened to}} with attention, and by a section of his party came {{to be regarded as}} a leader. In a debate on the convention with Spain, 9 March 1739, whereby peace was secured on payment by the Spanish government of a compensation to English traders, he declared that if Sir Robert Walpole ‘were determined to carry it by a majority, he would never again appear in the house till he perceived a change of measures’. He also distinguished himself in the debates in May 1751, on Lord Hardwicke's Regency Bill, especially by his resolute opposition to the <b>marriage</b> <b>clause.</b> There is a story that Walpole prevailed on Hardwicke, then Sir Philip Yorke, to quit the chief justiceship for the chancellorship, by the declaration: ‘If by one o'clock you do not accept my offer, Fazakerley by two becomes lord keeper of the great seal, and one of the staunchest whigs in all England!’. Another of his speeches which attracted attention was that delivered against the Jews' Naturalisation Bill, 7 May 1753.|$|E

5000|$|Luxuria also campaigned {{prior to}} the {{elections}} for gays to have cohabitation rights, and had helped campaign by winning the support of Italy's left. Furthermore, Luxuria outlined her long-term support for full gay marriage rights, comparable with Spain's implementation of the law. In September 2006, she stated that the Vatican's ongoing influence in politics, specifically in regards to gay <b>marriage,</b> contravened <b>clauses</b> of the Italian Constitution. Luxuria reacted to Pope Benedict XVI's end-of-year speech in 2008, when he compared protecting the environment with saving humanity from a [...] "blurring of gender" [...] (homosexual or transsexual behaviour), by saying that such comments were [...] "hurtful".|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} present an {{empirical}} {{research on the}} content of cohabitation contracts in the Netherlands, conducted in 2013. The legal professionals who mostly deal with cohabitation contracts - the notaries - have been asked to fill in a digital questionnaire. The format of this research is exploratory, painting a first picture of legal practice on making cohabitation contracts. The content of the average cohabitation contract differs very much compared to the content of the average <b>marriage</b> contract. <b>Clauses</b> that express solidarity between cohabitants (sharing income or property values or maintenance) are rare in cohabitation contracts, whereas they are rather popular in matrimonial property contracts. Further research is necessary to gain more insight into the legal practice of making cohabitation contracts...|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{the death}} in 1718 of his {{maternal}} uncle and second cousin, Charles XII of Sweden, Duke Charles Frederick {{was presented as}} claimant to the throne. However, his aunt Ulrika Eleonora the Younger (1688-1741) managed to wrest the throne for herself, claiming that her elder sister had not [...] "acquired {{the consent of the}} Parliamentary Estates" [...] for her marriage to his father, according to laws of succession laid down in Norrköpings arvförening. The duke's party asserted that the absolute monarchy in Sweden, which his grandfather King Charles XI had created, made that <b>marriage</b> <b>clause</b> irrelevant. Upon the news of the death of his uncle, he was reportedly too grief-stricken to take any action. Ulrika Eleonora's husband Frederick, however, who was also present with him in Tistedalen, rushed to assist her in claiming the throne. When Charles Frederick was confronted with Ulrika Eleonora, he was forced by Arvid Horn to greet her as queen. He asked to be granted the title Royal Highness and to be recognized as her heir, but when her husband instead was given the title, he left Sweden in 1719.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes people marry to take {{advantage}} of a certain situation, sometimes called a marriage of convenience or a sham marriage. For example, according to one publisher of information about green card marriages, [...] "Every year over 450,000 United States citizens marry foreign-born individuals and petition for them to obtain a permanent residency (Green Card) in the United States." [...] While this is likely an overestimate, in 2003 alone 184,741 immigrants were admitted to the U.S. as spouses of U.S. citizens. More were admitted as fiancés of US citizens for the purpose of being married within 90 days. Regardless of the number of people entering the US to marry a US citizen, it does not indicate the number of these marriages that are convenience marriages, which number could include some of those with the motive of obtaining permanent residency, but also include people who are US citizens. One example would be to obtain an inheritance that has a <b>marriage</b> <b>clause.</b> Another example would be to save money on health insurance or to enter a health plan with preexisting conditions offered by the new spouse's employer. Other situations exist, and, in fact, all marriages have a complex combination of conveniences motivating the parties to marry. A marriage of convenience is one that is devoid of normal reasons to marry. In certain countries like Singapore sham marriages like these are punishable criminal offences.|$|E
50|$|Following John's {{death in}} 1494, the new king Manuel I of Portugal {{restored}} {{the freedom of}} the Jews. However, in 1497, under the pressure of the newly born Spanish State through the <b>clause</b> <b>Marriage</b> of Isabella, Princess of Asturias, the Church and also of part of the Christian people, King Manuel I of Portugal decreed that all Jews had to convert to Christianity or leave the country without their children. Hard times followed for the Portuguese Jews, with the massacre of 2000 individuals in Lisbon in 1506, further forced deportations to São Tomé (where there is still a Jewish presence today), and the later and even more relevant establishment of the Portuguese Inquisition in 1536.|$|R
50|$|The defendant, County Clerk Smith, filed {{a notice}} of appeal with the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on January 16 and asked the Court to {{expedite}} the appeals process and hear the case along with a similar Utah case, Kitchen v. Herbert. The same 3-judge panel of the Tenth Circuit that heard oral arguments in Kitchen on April 10 heard oral arguments in Bishop on April 17. On July 18, the court upheld the District Court's ruling in a 2-1 decision, concluding that Oklahoma's same-sex <b>marriage</b> ban violates <b>clauses</b> of the United States Constitution, though it immediately stayed its ruling pending disposition of petition for review by the United States Supreme Court. Stanford Law Professor Jeffrey L. Fisher, an experienced Supreme Court litigator, joined as lead counsel for those challenging Oklahoma's denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples in August. The Supreme Court rejected Oklahoma's appeal on October 6, 2014 and the Tenth Circuit Court's ruling subsequently went into effect, thus legalizing same-sex marriage in Oklahoma. Governor Mary Fallin sharply criticized the Supreme Court's action, but announced that the state would comply and begin licensing and recognizing same-sex marriages.|$|R
