5|$|Metro {{contended that}} though TumbleSeed was marketed as a roguelike, {{apart from its}} procedurally {{generated}} levels, it was closer in genre to traditional arcade games. Though like roguelikes, player <b>mistakes</b> <b>are</b> costly and unforgivingly punished by returning the player {{to the beginning of}} the game. Polygon wrote that while this mechanic is acceptable, the act of losing all equipped upgrades upon losing a single heart was harsh.|$|E
5|$|In the game's primary single-player mode, titled GH Live {{within the}} game, the player completes songs while {{experiencing}} full-motion video {{taken from the}} first-person perspective of a band's lead guitarist. The video includes shots of the audience and the band members. As the player performs the songs, the audience responds positively to good performances when few <b>mistakes</b> <b>are</b> made. If the player makes several mistakes in a row, the audience will become critical and start to jeer at the performer. To win back the crowd, the player can either match more notes correctly, or can use collected Hero Power to rapidly regain their interest. Hero Power, replacing Star Power from previous Guitar Hero games, is collected by correctly playing marked series of notes on the track; Hero Power can be accumulated, marked as on-screen guitar picks next to the track, to be used at later times. The player can release Hero Power for a limited time by either tilting the guitar controller upward or hitting a special button on the controller.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} {{aircraft}} cockpit scene, {{the first officer}} is visibly reading from the script in his lap, and {{a flash of light}} from a flying saucer reveals the shadow of the boom microphone. The microphone and first officer's script are not visible in the film's original theatrical release, as they do not fit in the frame in its intended projection aspect ratio of 1.85:1. These <b>mistakes</b> <b>are</b> noticeable only in the film's open matte transfer on video.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} made by even {{a skilled}} farrier, {{especially if the}} horse does not stand still. This may sometimes result in a nail coming {{too close to the}} sensitive part of the hoof (putting pressure on it), or a nail that is driven slightly into the sensitive hoof, called quicking or nail pricking. This occurs when a nail penetrates the wall and hits the sensitive internal structures of the foot. Quicking results in bleeding and pain and the horse may show signs of lameness or may become lame in following days. Whenever it happens, the farrier must remove the offending nail. Usually a horse that is quicked will react immediately, though some cases where the nail is close to sensitive structures may not cause immediate problems. These <b>mistakes</b> <b>are</b> made occasionally by anyone who shoes horses, and in most cases is not an indication that the farrier is unskilled. It happens most commonly when horses move around while being shod, but also may occur if the hoof wall is particularly thin (common in Thoroughbreds), or if the hoof wall is brittle or damaged. It may also occur with an inexperienced or unskilled horseshoer who misdrives a nail, uses a shoe that is too small, or has not fitted the shoe to the shape of the horse's hoof. Occasionally, manufacturing defects in nails or shoes may also cause a misdriven nail that quicks a horse.|$|E

25|$|For a {{more direct}} comparison, matches in Twenty20 cricket, a form of limited overs cricket in which games last {{about the same time}} as a {{regulation}} baseball game, frequently produce combined run totals of 300 or more, with the all-time record being 469. Each run in a baseball game is roughly 75 times as important as a run in a Test cricket match (or 10–20 times the value of a cricketer scoring 4 or 6 runs off a single ball); therefore moments of poor pitching and individual fielding <b>mistakes</b> <b>are</b> much more costly. A baseball player who is a good batter but who is not a competent fielder will not play regularly, or only in the designated hitter position in leagues that use it.|$|E
25|$|About 1% of {{hospital}} admissions {{result in an}} adverse event due to negligence. However, <b>mistakes</b> <b>are</b> likely much more common, as these studies identify only mistakes that led to measurable adverse events occurring soon after the errors. Independent review of doctors' treatment plans suggests that decision-making could be improved in 14% of admissions; many of the benefits would have delayed manifestations. Even this number may be an underestimate. One study suggests that adults in the United States receive only 55% of recommended care. At the same time, a second study found that 30% of care in the United States may be unnecessary. For example, if a doctor fails to order a mammogram that is past due, this mistake will not {{show up in the}} first type of study. In addition, because no adverse event occurred during the short follow-up of the study, the mistake also would not show up in the second type of study because only the principal treatment plans were critiqued. However, the mistake would be recorded in the third type of study. If a doctor recommends an unnecessary treatment or test, it may not show in any of these types of studies.|$|E

500|$|Practice mode {{is a new}} {{addition}} to the game, allowing a player to practice certain sections of a song ("Verse 2," [...] "Chorus," [...] "Bridge 3," [...] "Gtr Solo 4," [...] etc.) on different difficulties and instruments.

Players can play the bass guitar lines on most songs. On others, a rhythm guitar line is available instead.|$|E
500|$|Misunderstanding of how Null {{works is}} the cause of a great number of errors in SQL code, both in ISO {{standard}} SQL statements and in the specific SQL dialects supported by real-world database management systems.

[...] Null is defined by the SQL standard as different from both an empty string and the numerical value 0, however. While Null indicates the absence of any value, the empty string and numerical zero both represent actual values.|$|E
500|$|Balzac {{experimented with}} this method {{throughout}} the thirty years {{he worked on}} La Comédie humaine.

[...] "When the characters reappear", notes the critic Samuel Rogers, [...] "they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from {{the privacy of their}} own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see." [...] Although the complexity of these characters' lives inevitably led Balzac to make errors of chronology and consistency, the <b>mistakes</b> <b>are</b> considered minor in the overall scope of the project. Readers are more often troubled by the sheer number of people in Balzac's world, and feel deprived of important context for the characters.
