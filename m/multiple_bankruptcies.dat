40|$|Solutions to {{the problem}} of {{international}} bankruptcy are generally framed as either universalist (arguing that international bankruptcies should be administered in a single forum) or territorialist (arguing in favor of <b>multiple</b> local <b>bankruptcies).</b> This article seeks to expand this debate by using traditional conflicts theory to examine the problem of cross-border bankruptcy. It analyzes the current regime under which cross-border bankruptcies are administered in U. S. courts, concluding that this regime operates as a multilateralist (jurisdiction-selecting) regime. Concluding that multilateralism is an appropriate method for resolving choice-of-law issues in international insolvency, the article analyzes some possible refinements to the current system. It argues that a more pointedly multilateralist approach would better serve the goals of the international bankruptcy regime...|$|R
50|$|Victims {{are people}} in {{financial}} trouble who believe they are becoming clients of a professional operation. The fraudster promises to make the foreclosures, evictions, repossessions, high interest rates on loans, and other debt problems go away. The victim pays a large initial fee for the fraudster's services, and the fraudster usually has the victim sign blank documents. Sometimes the victim is also told to make their usual payments directly to the fraudulent advisor instead of the real creditors, or to transfer their real estate to the fraudster. The payments are stolen by the fraudster instead of being used to pay victims' debts, and real estate is often deeded in fractional shares to other victims unknowingly under bankruptcy, complicating ownership to make foreclosures even more difficult by having <b>multiple</b> (fraudulent) <b>bankruptcies</b> involved in the property.|$|R

50|$|One {{criticism}} of the law was that the law made the discharge of liability for medical bills more difficult. A major target of the bill's opponents were provisions they described as beneficial to credit card companies. In particular, critics objected to the extension to eight years from six to the time before which debtors could liquidate their debts through bankruptcy, and requirements that those who file for <b>multiple</b> <b>bankruptcies</b> pay previous credit card debt {{that would have been}} forgiven under the old law. The bill's opponents were especially critical of provisions that expanded exemptions to the discharge of credit card debt, forcing spouses owed alimony to compete more often with credit card companies and other lenders for their unpaid child support. More broadly the bill's critics argued that the legislation did nothing to curtail what they characterize as predatory practices of credit card companies, such as exorbitant interest rates, rising and often hidden fees, and targeting minors and the recently bankrupt for new cards. The bill's critics argue that these practices are themselves significant contributors to the growth of consumer bankruptcies.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{synthesize}} the findings of prior bankruptcy prediction research studies by compiling and classifying the independent variables used as predictor variables in the studies. The objective is to find out the popularity of the different types of the predictor variables by classifying the variables into the categories describing the fincancial function of the variables, and by assessing the popularity of the significant variables in the categories. This work studies elementary theories on firm failure and bankruptcy to discuss and seek justitication for what might be the reasons for using the most popular financial function measures in the bankruptcy prediction. Bankruptcy prediction research literature covers vast amount of studies in which various different predicton models are developed for predicting bankruptcy. Usually these studies use a prediction model with a set of some financial and/or non-financial variables that are presumed to be relevant proxies for financial distress and eventually business failure and bankrupcty. However, there seems to be no consensus or unified theory on how the variables predicting bankrupcty should be selected, thus the numerous bankruptcy prediction research studies include vast number and various different types of variables that are presumed to be applicable in predicting bankruptcy. This study includes a systematic literature review where 51 bankruptcy prediction research studies were collected from well-recognized scientific journals. The studies included into the review were such that included a single or <b>multiple</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> prediction models, the detailed description of the independent variables, and the information about the statistical significances of the independent variables. The variables were then classified according to their financial function and a meta-analysis were conducted on those variables which were significant in bankruptcy prediction, to find out the popularity of the different variable categories. The findings of this study suggest that the most popular predictor variables included into the banktuptcy predicton models are accounting-based financial ratios, particurarly ones measuring liquidity, profitability, and financial leverage, and that there exists also theoretical foundation for using these variables in the bankruptcy prediction...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, Combinatorial Clock Auctions (CCAs) {{have been}} used {{around the world to}} {{allocate}} frequency spectrum for mobile telecom licenses. CCAs are claimed to significantly reduce the scope for gaming or strategic bidding. In this paper, we show, however, that CCAs significantly enhance the possibilities for strategic bidding. Real bidders in telecom markets are not only interested in the spectrum they win themselves and the price they pay for that, but also in the price competitors pay for that spectrum. Moreover, budget constraints play an important role. When these considerations are taken into account, CCAs provide bidders with significant gaming possibilities, resulting in high auction prices and problems associated with <b>multiple</b> equilibria and <b>bankruptcy</b> (given optimal bidding strategies) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{seniority}} of debt, which {{determines the}} order in which a bankrupt institution repays its debts, is an important and sometimes contentious feature of financial crises, yet its impact on system-wide stability is not well understood. We capture seniority of debt in a multiplex network, a graph of nodes connected by multiple types of edges. Here, an edge between banks denotes a debt contract of a certain level of seniority. Next we study cascading default. There exist <b>multiple</b> kinds of <b>bankruptcy,</b> indexed by the highest level of seniority at which a bank cannot repay all its debts. Self-interested banks would prefer that all their loans be made at the most senior level. However, mixing debts of different seniority levels makes the system more stable, in that it shrinks the set of network densities for which bankruptcies spread widely. We compute the optimal ratio of senior to junior debts, which we call the optimal seniority ratio, for two uncorrelated Erdos-Renyi networks. If institutions erode their buffer against insolvency, then this optimal seniority ratio rises; in other words, if default thresholds fall, then more loans should be senior. We generalize the analytical results to arbitrarily many levels of seniority and to heavy-tailed degree distributions. Comment: 16 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|Session 6 : Special {{focus on}} Asian Insolvency Law'In our modern era of globalisation, failing or failed {{companies}} disrupt {{international trade and}} commerce unless cross-border insolvency (CBI) laws enable their orderly restructuring or liquidation across <b>multiple</b> jurisdictions. The <b>bankruptcy</b> of Lehman Brothers in 2008 is the quintessential CBI: the US investment bank’s bankruptcy resulted in 75 separate legal proceedings in nine countries concerning US$ 639 billion in assets, US$ 619 billion in debt and 25, 000 employees worldwide. CBI concerns a failing or failed debtor company whose creditors, assets and/or place of incorporation are located in different jurisdictions. Therefore, restructuring or liquidation of the debtor company occurs in multiple jurisdictions, and judicial decisions made in one jurisdiction may not be recognised or enforced in another. Before China assumed sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, China regarded Hong Kong as a foreign jurisdiction and, as such, judicial recognition between them was sought through international conventions. However, after the handover, international conventions {{could no longer be}} applied because under international law 'an international convention may only be applied among states as independent subjects of the international community, but not directly to any part of a country without transplantation'. (Zhu, 2009) Hong Kong-China CBI thus belonged to neither international nor ‘traditional’ domestic laws. This legal lacuna poses challenges to Hong Kong and Chinese courts in granting judicial recognition to assist in restructuring or liquidation and ensuring justice is done in resolving CBI disputes. The existing legal framework for judicial recognition lies with the Agreement of Mutual Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters between Mainland China and Hong Kong SAR (the 2006 Agreement). However, as suggested by its name, the agreement applies only to civil and commercial matters and does not cover CBI matters. This unsettled CBI issue must be resolved, given Hong Kong’s status as a global financial centre and China’s as the world’s second largest economy, because their courts are asked frequently to adjudicate on CBI disputes even though neither jurisdiction has adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency which establishes international CBI standards. I, the presenter, will examine methods to fill the legal lacuna and resolve the unsettled CBI issue: specifically, whether an extension of the 2006 Agreement could cover Hong Kong-China CBI cases; whether a treaty or bilateral agreement that focuses on mutual judicial recognition of CBI judgments will be signed; or whether Hong Kong and Chinese courts would sign Memorandums of Understanding for CBI judicial recognition. ...|$|R
