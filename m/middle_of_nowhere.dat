When the family drives out into the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> at night {{with no place to}} stay, they come across a man who takes them to a county called The Outlands, which is a dirty, run-down place where there are no rules and regulations.

5|$|However, {{once on the}} bus, Lisa {{realizes she}} is on the wrong bus and is dropped off in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere.</b> During his lunch break at work, Homer has a {{conversation}} with Lenny and Carl. He tells them that he let Lisa ride the bus alone. Lenny and Carl point out the error of his judgment, and Homer leaves work to go look for her. He heads to the museum and ends up in downtown Springfield. He uses a cherrypicker to get up higher. Homer and Lisa spot each other, but the vehicle's wheels creak backwards and it rolls down a hill. It slides off the edge of a pier at the harbor into a river. Lisa tells the drawbridge operator to close the bridge so Homer can grab on. His head is caught between the two closing halves and he survives with nothing more than a few tire marks across his forehead.|$|E

Two singles of The Sounds, Dance with Me and Rock 'n Roll, were promoted on Kimberly's car stereo. Besides these, the music video of Seven Days a Week accompanied the film's DVD. <b>Middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nowhere</b> by The Blank Theory was both heard on Evan's car radio and inserted in the DVD along with its music video. Rocky Mountain High by John Denver was covered twice in the end credits by Pete Snell and Jude Christodal. Christodal also performed My Name is Death during Brian's death and the end credits. Other songs integrated were Highway to Hell by AC/DC (on Kimberly's car AV), Jon F. Hennessy by FT (on Rory's vehicle audio), Vitamin by Incubus (during Evan's house fire) and I Got You by (hed) Planet Earth (during Rory's party).|$|E

5000|$|The musicians {{stayed at}} the Marriott Shoals in Florence and woke early each morning, eating breakfast at a local Cracker Barrel before {{arriving}} at the studio by 10 a.m. Entering the sessions, Carney had a negative mindset due to his divorce. He said, [...] "At {{the time it was}} really, really difficult for me because I had just split with my wife after a nine-year relationship and the last place I wanted to be was the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> fucking <b>nowhere</b> in Alabama, sitting in a dark room." [...] The first song recorded at Muscle Shoals, [...] "Next Girl", helped shape the direction of the sessions. Auerbach's lyrics for the song about moving on resonated with the [...] "bummed-out and spacey" [...] Carney, and Auerbach noticed an improvement in his bandmate's mentality immediately after he heard them. Auerbach said, [...] "When he heard the lyrics, he was just so stoked. The rest of the session it was smooth sailing." [...] "Next Girl" [...] was first cut with Carney playing drums and Auerbach playing bass, without guide vocals or the band's more usual guitar. The group continued to use a rhythm-first approach throughout the sessions, recording a basic arrangement of drums and bass before overdubbing guitar, keyboards, vocals, and percussion later. This imbued several songs, such as [...] "Everlasting Light", [...] "Howlin' for You", and [...] "Sinister Kid", with a bass-driven sound. Neill found the emphasis on bass was also a result of the studio's acoustics: ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{two boys}} {{got into trouble}} with the law for {{breaking}} into a locked van and stealing computers. In January 1998, they were charged with mischief, breaking and entering, trespassing, and theft. They both left good impressions on the juvenile officers, who offered to expunge their criminal records if they agreed to attend a diversionary program to include community service, received psychiatric treatment, and obeyed the law. Harris was required to attend anger management classes where, again, he made a favorable impression. They were so well-behaved that their probation officer discharged them from the program a few months earlier than the due date. Of Harris, it was remarked that he was [...] "a very bright individual who is likely to succeed in life", while Klebold was said to be intelligent, but [...] "needs to understand that hard work is part of fulfilling a dream." [...] On April 30, Harris handed over the first version of a letter of apology he wrote to the owner of the van, which he completed the next month. In the letter, Harris expressed regret about his actions; however, in one of his journal entries dated April 12, he wrote: [...] "Isnt america supposed to be the land of the free? how come, If im free, I cant deprive some fucking dumbshit from his possessions If he leaves them sitting {{in the front seat of}} his fucking van in plain sight in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> fucking <b>nowhere</b> on a fri-fucking-day night?

Two Cercle fans proposed to the Cercle Brugge board that they give the referee {{a ride to the}} Bruges railway station; the board accepted, but the fans instead drove the referee toward Zedelgem, where they threw him from the car in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the tour's {{last show}} {{concluded}} in San Francisco, Shi secretly left his {{hotel in the}} middle of the night and escaped in order to defect from China to the United States. Speaking no English, Shi directed a cab driver with hand signals to an unknown destination, but the frustrated driver dropped him off in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> and called the police. Shi showed the police his passport and some newspaper clippings featuring him, so the police requested the driver take him to a Chinese restaurant in order to find someone who could communicate with him. However, since the staff at the restaurant spoke only Cantonese, and not Shi's Mandarin, the monk wrote down his communications, since both dialects employ the same characters. The restaurant staff helped Shi phone a friend in New York City, who had someone pick up Shi, who hid in a basement for a week, eating only bread and cereal, while the news media were reporting his escape. After a week, he traveled to New York.|$|E
25|$|Since Korellian law forbids Foundation missionaries {{to be on}} {{the planet}} under penalty of death, the crew determines that the Reverend Jord Parma of Anacreon (as he calls himself) had been {{captured}} by the Korellians but managed to escape before being killed. Rev. Parma is injured, apparently mentally confused, and in need of hospitalization. A short time after Parma has been aboard the ship, an angry mob appears, surrounding the Far Star, and demanding that the missionary be turned over to them as an escaped criminal. This rapid response by the Korellians in what is an extremely remote location arouses Mallow's suspicions: Where did Parma actually escape from? Why was there a mob seemingly already gathered in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere?</b> And how were they able to pinpoint the location of the Far Star and surround it so promptly after Parma boarded the ship? Suspecting a set-up, rather than fight the mob, Mallow decides to turn the missionary over to them (and to certain death), despite Twer's frantic attempt to intervene. Soon afterwards, Mallow is invited to meet with Korell's authoritarian ruler, Commdor ("First Citizen Of The State") Asper Argo, indicating that Mallow had apparently passed a test by the Korellians by showing respect for their laws. Argo appears friendly and welcomes Foundation technological gifts; however, he refuses to allow Scientism on Korell, and Mallow agrees not to encourage missionary work in the Republic.|$|E

Ryder won acclaim for her role, and the Los Angeles Times called her performance in Square Dance [...] "a remarkable debut." [...] Both films, however, were only marginally successful commercially. Director Tim Burton decided to cast Ryder in his film Beetlejuice (1988), after being impressed with her performance in Lucas. In the film, she plays goth teenager Lydia Deetz. Lydia's family moves to a haunted house populated by ghosts played by Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin and Michael Keaton. Lydia quickly finds herself the only human with a strong empathy toward the ghosts and their situation. The film was a success at the box office, and Ryder's performance and the overall film received mostly positive reviews from critics.|$|E
