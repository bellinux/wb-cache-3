The equations of motion of such systems {{can be described in}} matrix form, with a <b>mass</b> <b>matrix</b> multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial {{when it comes to the}} internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, Riazuddin {{began his}} {{research}} in the series unsolved problems in physics where he published papers in a large sum. In 2005, at the National Center for Physics (NCP), Riazuddin presented his briefed papers on neutrinos where he provided the mathematical framework of the neutrinos. Neutrinos have heavier masses but the Neutrino oscillations do not completely identify the overall scale of their exact masses because they are exceedingly tiny. To determine the exact masses, Riazuddin introduced the laws of limits, as he realised there was a limit, to the electron energy spectra in tritium β-decay. In 2007, Riazuddin introduced SU(3) symmetry {{in the theory of}} double beta decay. He postulated the light neutrinos formed a [...] Triplet state in a SU(3) symmetry during the process. In 2008, Riazuddin pointed out that the neutrino mass has μ and τ symmetry and Lepton number remains constant, a new type of Seesaw mechanism is formed, the so-called Riazuddin's Seesaw Model, the Dirac <b>mass</b> <b>matrix</b> provided the Yukawa coupling to follow the Majorana fermion to satisfy the Leptogenesis asymmetry. Riazuddin proposed that this such interaction can be avoid when two of the heavy right-hand neutrinos are (nearly) degenerate.|$|E
