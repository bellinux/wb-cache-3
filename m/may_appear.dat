5|$|Pain {{produced}} by cancer within the pelvis {{varies depending on}} the affected tissue. It <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> {{at the site of}} the cancer but it frequently radiates diffusely to the upper thigh, and may refer to the lower back, the external genitalia or perineum.|$|E
5|$|The obstruent slot of an onset or coda may {{consist of}} {{multiple}} obstruents itself. Here, too, only {{one member of}} each subgroup of obstruents <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> in the cluster; a cluster may not contain multiple laryngeals, sibilants or plosives.|$|E
5|$|The {{paraphrase}} technique {{differs from}} the cantus-firmus technique in that the source material, though it still consists of a monophonic original, is embellished, often with ornaments. As in the cantus-firmus technique, the source tune <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> in many voices of the mass.|$|E

5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe the corona (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona. According to the point reached in the solar cycle, the corona <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. It is very hard to predict this in advance.|$|E
5|$|Although the Egyptians {{believed}} their gods {{to be present}} in the world around them, contact between the human and divine realms was mostly limited to specific circumstances. In literature, gods <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> to humans in a physical form, but in real life the Egyptians were limited to more indirect means of communication.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria {{poisoning}} {{has occurred}} in young children and in people who ingested the mushrooms for a hallucinogenic experience. Occasionally it has been ingested in error, because immature button forms resemble puffballs. The white spots sometimes wash away during heavy rain and the mushrooms then <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> to be the edible A.caesarea.|$|E

5|$|I do {{not know}} what I <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and {{diverting}} myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.|$|E
5|$|Other {{deviations}} from the texts <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> in the attributes held by the divine couple. Parvati may hold a mirror, instead of the lotus. Shiva may be shown holding the trishula (trident) and damaru (drum) in his back hands. Regional variations in iconography may also occur. In Bengal, Shiva holds a karttari (knife), the ceremonial weapon that a Hindu groom from Bengal is expected to carry in a wedding.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic and vaginal {{ultrasounds}} {{are helpful}} {{in the diagnosis}} of PID. In {{the early stages of}} infection, the ultrasound <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> normal. As the disease progresses, nonspecific findings can include free pelvic fluid, endometrial thickening, uterine cavity distension by fluid or gas. In some instances the borders of the uterus and ovaries appear indistinct. Enlarged ovaries accompanied by increased numbers of small cysts correlates with PID.|$|E

5|$|Secondary {{progressive}} MS {{occurs in}} around 65% {{of those with}} initial relapsing-remitting MS, who eventually have progressive neurologic decline between acute attacks without any definite periods of remission. Occasional relapses and minor remissions <b>may</b> <b>appear.</b> The most common length of time between disease onset and conversion from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive MS is 19years.|$|E
5|$|Stage 1 (30 {{minutes to}} 12 hours) {{consists}} of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> to be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, drooling, depressed, and have slurred speech, seizuring, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{is quick}} to learn but can be headstrong, though with correct {{training}} can become very obedient. The Welsh Springer was bred for work and endurance, and as with many breeds of hunting dogs requires a regular exercise routine to keep them healthy and content. Without adequate exercise, a Welsh Springer Spaniel <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> hyperactive. Some Welsh Springers can become clingy towards their owners and suffer separation anxiety when alone.|$|E

5|$|The {{speed limit}} is , due to curves, {{wildlife}} and tourists. Bicycles, motor vehicles, and pedestrians share the road. There are also deer, black bears, turkey, and other wildlife, which <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> and cross the road without warning. These all require extra precautions. The speed limit {{within the park}} is strictly enforced by park rangers. Numerous trails can be accessed along the drive, including {{a portion of the}} Appalachian Trail, which follows the road's path.|$|E
5|$|The {{thesis of}} eliminativism {{seems to be}} so {{obviously}} wrong to many critics, under the claim that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. This sort of intuition pumping is illustrated by asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies {{from the history of}} science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: it <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but for all its apparent obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless. Similarly, it <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions. Nevertheless, this could equally turn out to be false.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} {{is distinguished}} from other dark-plumaged birds by its yellow tail and ear markings, and its contact call. Parts of its range overlap with the ranges of two cockatoo species that have red tail banding, the red-tailed cockatoo and the glossy black cockatoo. Crow species <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> similar when seen flying at a distance; however, crows have shorter tails, a quicker wing beat, and different calls.|$|E

5|$|They {{contain a}} wide array of physiognomical representations. Van Gogh's mental and {{physical}} condition is usually apparent; he <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> unkempt, unshaven or with a neglected beard, with deeply sunken eyes, a weak jaw, or having lost teeth. Some show him with full lips, a long face or prominent skull, or sharpened, alert features. His hair may be the usual red, or at times ash coloured.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{abnormalities}} may {{be categorized}} {{according to whether}} they have environmental or developmental causes. While environmental abnormalities <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> to have an obvious cause, there may {{not appear to be}} any known cause for some developmental abnormalities. Environmental forces may affect teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of tooth eruption. Developmental abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.|$|E
5|$|Up to 85% {{of people}} {{infected}} with H. pylori never experience symptoms or complications. Acute infection <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> as an acute gastritis with abdominal pain (stomach ache) or nausea. Where this develops into chronic gastritis, the symptoms, if present, are often those of non-ulcer dyspepsia: stomach pains, nausea, bloating, belching, and sometimes vomiting or black stool.|$|E
