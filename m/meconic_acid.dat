2500|$|In {{the opium}} poppy, the {{alkaloids}} {{are bound to}} <b>meconic</b> <b>acid.</b> The method is to extract from the crushed plant with diluted sulfuric acid, which is a stronger acid than <b>meconic</b> <b>acid,</b> but not so strong to react with alkaloid molecules. The extraction is performed in many steps (one amount of crushed plant is extracted at least six to ten times, so practically every alkaloid goes into the solution). From the solution obtained at the last extraction step, the alkaloids are precipitated by either ammonium hydroxide or sodium carbonate. The last step is purifying and separating morphine from other opium alkaloids. The somewhat similar Gregory process {{was developed in the}} United Kingdom during the Second World War, which begins with stewing the entire plant, in most cases save the roots and leaves, in plain or mildly acidified water, then proceeding through steps of concentration, extraction, and purification of alkaloids. Other methods of processing [...] "poppy straw" [...] (i.e., dried pods and stalks) use steam, one or more of several types of alcohol, or other organic solvents.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meconic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{also known}} as acidum meconicum and poppy acid, is a {{chemical}} substance found in certain plants of the Papaveraceae family (poppy) such as Papaver somniferum (opium poppy) and Papaver bracteatum. <b>Meconic</b> <b>acid</b> constitutes about 5% of opium {{and can be used}} as an analytical marker for the presence of opium. <b>Meconic</b> <b>acid</b> has erroneously been described as a mild narcotic, but it has little or no physiological activity, and is not used medicinally. <b>Meconic</b> <b>acid</b> forms salts with alkaloids and metals. These salts as well as <b>meconic</b> <b>acid</b> esters are called meconates. <b>Meconic</b> <b>acid</b> was first isolated by Friedrich Sertürner in 1805.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meconic</b> <b>acid</b> is a dicarboxylic acid. Its {{structure}} {{contains two}} carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) and one keto group (=O) {{attached to a}} pyran ring. <b>Meconic</b> <b>acid</b> gives a red color with ferric chloride. <b>Meconic</b> <b>acid</b> is colorless and is only slightly soluble in water but readily soluble in alcohol.|$|E
50|$|Others: Other {{characteristic}} substances {{contained within}} these species include: <b>meconic</b> <b>acid</b> and chelidonic acid, {{as well as}} cyanogenic glycoside compounds derived from tyrosine: dhurrin and triglochinin; in the Fumarioideae while the Chelidonieae contain the free amino acid δ-acetylornithine.|$|E

40|$|Two {{series of}} {{complexes}} of <b>meconic</b> <b>acid</b> (H 3 Mec) with rare-earths {{have been prepared}} by varying the preparative procedure. The compounds have the general formulae, [Ln(Mec) (H 2 O) 2]· 3 H 2 O (whereLn=La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Ho and Y) and [Ln(HMec) (H 2 Mec) (H 2 O) 2]· 4 H 2 O (whereLn=La, Pr, Nd and Sm). The infrared spectral data indicate that the carboxylate groups are bound to the rare-earth metal in a bidentate fashion. Thermal studies indicate that two water molecules are coordinated in each case. The complexes are probably polymeric...|$|E
30|$|Opium is an {{air-dried}} latex {{obtained by}} incision from the unripe seed pods/capsules of Papaver somniferum (Papaveraceae). It varies in color from yellow to dark brown {{and has a}} characteristic odor and a bitter taste. It is a non-homogeneous, sticky, tar-like and dark brown material when fresh, and fragile and hard when aged. It contains about 40 alkaloids, which constitute about 25 % of the opium, up to 25 % water, <b>meconic</b> <b>acid,</b> some lactic and sulfuric acids, albumin, mucilage, sugar, and some resinous and waxy-like substances. The principal active alkaloids of opium are morphine (4 to 21 %), codeine (0.7 to 3 %), thebaine (0.2 to 1 %), papaverine (0.5 to 1.3 %), and noscapine (2 to 8 %) (Moffat et al. 2011).|$|E
40|$|Mixed {{crystals}} of aromatic {{carboxylic acid}} crystals containing organic, biomolecular and inorganic chromophores are prepared and described. Each of these chromophores recognizes specific growth sectors within these crystals during growth from solution. The chromophores were, in most cases, oriented as evident by the strong linear dichroism and/or fluorescence anisotropy. Two aromatic carboxylic acid host crystals were emphasized. The first, phthalic acid (1, 2 -benzenedicarboxylic acid), {{is shown to}} encapsulate a variety of azo and triarylmethane dyes, biopolymers and dichromate salts. The second, poppy acid (<b>meconic</b> <b>acid,</b> or 3 -hydroxy- 2, 6 dicarboxy-γ-pyrone) is shown to encapsulate a number of organic dyes of various size and shape. The anisotropy of chromophore absorption or emission within these crystalline matrices is quantified by polarization spectroscopies. Orientations of these chromophores within the host crystals as well as mechanisms for mixed crystal formation and growth sector recognition are discussed. ...|$|E
