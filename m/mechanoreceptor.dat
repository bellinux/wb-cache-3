25|$|Two {{types of}} sensory fibers have cell {{bodies in the}} mesencephalic nucleus: {{proprioceptor}} fibers from the jaw and <b>mechanoreceptor</b> fibers from the teeth. Some of these incoming fibers go to the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (V), bypassing the pathways for conscious perception. The jaw jerk reflex is an example; tapping the jaw elicits a reflex closure of the jaw {{in the same way}} that tapping the knee elicits a reflex kick of the lower leg. Other incoming fibers from the teeth and jaws go to the main nucleus of V. This information is projected bilaterally to the thalamus and available for conscious perception.|$|E
25|$|The trigeminal nucleus extends {{throughout}} the brainstem, from the midbrain to the medulla, continuing into the cervical cord (where it merges with the dorsal horn {{cells of the}} spinal cord). The nucleus {{is divided into three}} parts, visible in microscopic sections of the brainstem. From caudal to rostral (ascending from the medulla to the midbrain), they are the spinal trigeminal, the principal sensory and the mesencephalic nuclei. The parts of the trigeminal nucleus receive different types of sensory information; the spinal trigeminal nucleus receives pain-temperature fibers, the principal sensory nucleus receives touch-position fibers and the mesencephalic nucleus receives proprioceptor and <b>mechanoreceptor</b> fibers from the jaws and teeth.|$|E
50|$|Afferent nerve fibers {{responsible}} for sensory stimulus detection and feedback are especially sensitive to stimulation. This {{results from the}} specialized <b>mechanoreceptor</b> cells that are superimposed upon the afferent nerve fibers. Stretch-activated ion channels are located on these <b>mechanoreceptor</b> cells and serve to lower the action potential threshold, thus making the afferent nerves more sensitive to stimulation. Afferent nerve endings without <b>mechanoreceptor</b> cells are called free nerve endings. They are less sensitive than the encapsulated afferent fibers and generally function {{in the perception of}} pain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mechanoreceptors</b> that {{possess a}} large {{diameter}} and high myelination are called low-threshold <b>mechanoreceptors.</b> Fibers that respond only to skin movement are termed rapidly adapting <b>mechanoreceptors</b> (RA), while those that respond also static indentation are termed slowly adapting <b>mechanoreceptors</b> (SA).|$|R

50|$|Cutaneous <b>mechanoreceptors</b> with small, {{accurate}} receptive {{fields are}} found in areas needing accurate taction (e.g. the fingertips). In the fingertips and lips, innervation density of slowly adapting type I and rapidly adapting type I <b>mechanoreceptors</b> are greatly increased. These two types of <b>mechanoreceptors</b> have small discrete receptive fields and are thought to underlie most low-threshold use of the fingers in assessing texture, surface slip, and flutter. <b>Mechanoreceptors</b> found {{in areas of the}} body with less tactile acuity tend to have larger receptive fields.|$|R

30|$|Three studies {{employing}} {{gold chloride}} staining {{to look for}} <b>mechanoreceptors</b> have been conducted to date [14, 16, 19]. Denti et al. [14] found that <b>mechanoreceptors</b> were detectable up till 3  months after injury, after which they gradually decreased in number. They {{did not find any}} <b>mechanoreceptors</b> in any case with duration of injury of more than 1  year. Adachi et al. [19] performed a similar study and found <b>mechanoreceptors</b> in all examined specimens (with duration of injury ranging from 2  months to 10  years). They concluded that there is no correlation between the number of <b>mechanoreceptors</b> and duration of injury, in contradistinction to the finding of Denti et al. Georgoulis et al. [16] found <b>mechanoreceptors</b> in all cases where a portion of the ACL was attached to the PCL, but none or very few in stumps which were free. The shortcomings of gold chloride staining must be acknowledged. Firstly, {{there is a lack of}} standardization of the staining technique [2, 3, 23]. Secondly, nonspecific staining of blood vessels, collagen, and elastic fibrils may occur, resulting in incorrect labeling as <b>mechanoreceptors</b> [20, 23]. Third, <b>mechanoreceptors</b> picked up by this method may be morphologically normal while their significance as far as proprioception is concerned is equivocal [1, 15].|$|R
50|$|The {{specific}} {{mechanics of}} proprioception in the temporomandibular joint involve four receptors. Ruffini endings function as static <b>mechanoreceptors</b> which position the mandible.

30|$|Lee et al. [2] {{used the}} same {{immunohistochemical}} method as applied here, finding 17 <b>mechanoreceptors</b> in 12 out of 36 specimens compared with 19 <b>mechanoreceptors</b> in a control group of 2 specimens. Five of them had necrotized morphology with weak staining and loose form, which was often found in degenerative joint. They speculated that the receptors probably degenerated after injury.

40|$|Introduction: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the association between frequency of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) <b>mechanoreceptors</b> and age in men. Methods: Nineteen normal right knees harvested from human male cadavers were evaluated. Age ranged from 17 to 64 years with a mean of 35 years old. PCL was separated for sampling in femoral and tibial portions. Topographic distribution and frequency within the ligament texture were determined employing the Pro-Image digital analysis system. <b>Mechanoreceptors</b> were counted and classified according to the criteria proposed by Freeman & Wyke. Results: A total of 1820 <b>mechanoreceptors</b> were found, Type II being the most frequent one. Analysis of the femoral portion of the ligament showed an equivalent predominance of Types II and IV <b>mechanoreceptors.</b> Tibial portion had a predominance of Type II <b>mechanoreceptors,</b> followed by Type IV. At this portion, receptors Types I and III were less commonly identified. Conclusion: in the tibial portion of the PCL, there is predominance of Type II <b>mechanoreceptors</b> followed by Types IV, I and III <b>mechanoreceptors,</b> respectively. No relationship was found between the total number of <b>mechanoreceptors</b> and age in the femoral and tibial portions of the PCL.

50|$|Feelings of deep {{pressure}} (from a poke, for instance) {{are generated}} from lamellar corpuscles (the only {{other type of}} phasic tactile <b>mechanoreceptor),</b> which are located deeper in the dermis, and some free nerve endings.|$|E
50|$|The Slowly Adapting type 1 (SA1) <b>mechanoreceptor,</b> {{with the}} Merkel {{corpuscle}} end-organ, underlies {{the perception of}} form and roughness on the skin. They have small receptive fields and produce sustained responses to static stimulation.|$|E

40|$|The rapidly {{adapting}} (RA) low-threshold <b>mechanoreceptors</b> {{respond to}} {{movement of the}} skin and vibration and are critical for the perception of texture and shape. In this issue of Neuron, two papers (Bourane et al. and Luo et al.) demonstrate that early-born Ret+ sensory neurons are RA <b>mechanoreceptors,</b> whose peripheral nerve terminals are associated with Meissner corpuscles, longitudinal lanceolate endings, and Pacinian corpuscles. The studies further show that Ret signaling {{is essential for the}} development of these <b>mechanoreceptors...</b>|$|R
50|$|The electroreceptors {{are located}} in rostrocaudal rows in {{the skin of the}} bill, while <b>mechanoreceptors</b> (which detect touch) are uniformly {{distributed}} across the bill. The electrosensory area of the cerebral cortex is contained within the tactile somatosensory area, and some cortical cells receive input from both electroreceptors and <b>mechanoreceptors,</b> suggesting a close association between the tactile and electric senses. Both electroreceptors and <b>mechanoreceptors</b> in the bill dominate the somatotopic map of the platypus brain, in the same way human hands dominate the Penfield homunculus map.|$|R

50|$|In rodents, the trigeminal {{ganglion}} is important {{as it is}} {{the first part of the}} pathway from the whiskers to the brain. Cell bodies of the whisker primary afferents are found here. These afferents are <b>mechanoreceptor</b> cells that fire in response to whisker deflection.|$|E
5000|$|Touch messages, in {{comparison}} to other sensory stimuli, have a large distance to travel {{to get to the}} brain. Tactual perception is achieved through the response of mechanoreceptors in the skin that detect physical stimuli. The response from a <b>mechanoreceptor</b> detecting pressure can be experienced as a touch, discomfort, or pain, and the force of pressure is measured by a pressure algometer and a dolorimeter. [...] Mechanoreceptors are situated in highly vascularized skin, and appear in both glabrous and hairy skin. Each <b>mechanoreceptor</b> is tuned to a different sensitivity, and will fire its action potential only when there is enough energy. [...] The axons of these single tactile receptors will converge into a single nerve trunk, and the signal is then sent to the spinal cord where the message makes its way to the somatosensory systems in the brain.|$|E

50|$|In {{order for}} {{mechanical}} signals to be sensed, there {{need to be}} <b>mechanoreceptors</b> {{on the surface of}} chondrocytes. Candidates for chondrocyte <b>mechanoreceptors</b> include stretch-activated ion channels (SAC), the hyaluronan receptor CD44, annexin V (a collagen type II receptor), and integrin receptors (of which there exist several types on chondrocytes).|$|R
50|$|Specialized sensory {{receptor}} cells called <b>mechanoreceptors</b> often encapsulate afferent fibers to help tune the afferent fibers {{to the different}} types of somatic stimulation. <b>Mechanoreceptors</b> also help lower thresholds for action potential generation in afferent fibers and thus make them more likely to fire in the presence of sensory stimulation.|$|R
50|$|A hair plexus or {{root hair}} plexus {{is a special}} group of nerve fiber endings {{and serves as a}} very {{sensitive}} <b>mechanoreceptor</b> for touch sensation.

50|$|Tactile corpuscles (or Meissner's corpuscles) are {{a type of}} <b>mechanoreceptor.</b> They are a type {{of nerve}} ending in the skin that is {{responsible}} for sensitivity to light touch.
