40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} the adsorption of nitrogen and argon on pores in natural <b>mordenites</b> {{before and after}} acid leaching treatment. The exchange with H+ ions during dealumination favors the creation of emergent pores thus causing an increase of the adsorption capacity.

40|$|In {{this work}} Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) {{study has been}} applied to study the adsorption of carbon monoxide on transition metal (Mn+, Co 2 +, Ni 2 +) ion-exchanged zeolites type Y, X and <b>mordenites.</b> The adsorption of CO at room temperature produces overlapping IR absorption bands in the 2120  2200 cm- 1 region. The frequency of the band around 2200 cm- 1 is found to be dependent not only on the charge-balancing transition metal cation, but also on the framework composition. The frequencies of the band near 1600 cm- 1 was found to be dependent on the Si/Al ratio of the investigated zeolites...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} main {{aspects of}} the Dipole-Quadrupole theory of Surface Enhanced Infrared Absorption (SEIRA).

Observation of such lines in the SEIRA spectra of diprotonated and ethylene, adsorbed on and on <b>mordenites</b> is pointed out. The results well agree with our ideas about surface enhanced optical processes, based on the conception of a strong quadrupole light-molecule interaction, which allows us to develop the SERS and SEHRS theories.

5000|$|Sedimentary {{deposits}} of <b>mordenite</b> {{are present in}} several countries, especially in Bulgaria, Hungary, Japan and the United States. Quarried material is generally substantial, e.g., a recent estimate of the yearly production in Japan is 150,000 tons.|$|E
50|$|Situated on the Bay of Fundy coast, it had {{a public}} wharf and fishing weirs {{although}} they have now disappeared. Today Morden hosts a mix of year-round and seasonal residents. The zeolite mineral <b>Mordenite</b> was named for the town of Morden when Henry How discovered it in 1864.|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen {{adsorption}} isotherms {{have been carried}} out on Y zeolites and dealuminated Y zeolites, <b>mordenites</b> and dealuminated <b>mordenites,</b> and ZSM- 5 zeolites. The treatment of these isotherms by the Dubinin-Radushkevich method has led to a first estimation of the microporous volume of these zeolites. The t method has been used to determine their external surface and to obtain estimation of the microporous volumes. It is shown that the Dubinin-Radushkevich method overestimates the microporous volume of solids with important external surface. It is also shown that the choice of the standard t function and the part of the V-t curve considered for the Linear fitting may drastically influence the microporous volume and the external surface obtained by the t method. A new way of treating the N- 2 adsorption isotherm to establish the microporous volume and the external surface of zeolites is proposed. This method assumes that the experimental adsorption isotherm may be decomposed into two parts corresponding, respectively, to the adsorption on the external surface and to the adsorption in the micropores. It is considered that the BET equation governs the adsorption on the external surface, while the adsorption in the micropores can be described by the Dubinin-Radushkevich equation. The correlation coefficient of the BET curve obtained from the experimental isotherm corrected for the adsorption in the micropores is optimized by adjusting the limiting adsorption volume and the adsorption energy of the Dubinin-Radushkevich equation. The C-BET, the microporous volumes, and the energy of adsorption in the micropores obtained in this way are consistent with the data of the literature...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNO TPD, H 2 -TPR and XRD {{have been}} used to characterise copper-exchanged <b>mordenites</b> with {{different}} Si/Al ratios, copper contents and cocations. The results showed that copper is mainly in the form of isolated Cu 2 + ions in CuMOR catalysts with copper exchange ? 20 %, whereas at higher copper exchange CuO species are also present. These results were obtained with H and Na as cocation and were achieved by changing either the catalyst Si/Al ratio or the copper content. The data also indicate that the cocation mainly affects copper location and that copper is more easily reduced in sodium form catalysts than in protonic form. It was found that the isolated Cu 2 + ions are the most effective species for NO adsorption and the most active species for NO SCR...|$|R
40|$|Conversion of {{n-butane}} was studied between 523 K and 623 K over acidic <b>mordenites</b> with SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratios between 10 and 20. The {{main products}} were iso-butane, propane, and pentane. The selectivity to olefins, methane, ethane, C 6 paraffins, and aromatics {{was lower than}} 4 mol% under all reaction conditions. Isomerization and disproportionation were identified to be the dominating reactions. At 523 K, both reactions are suggested to proceed via dimeric intermediates. Their relative contributions to the total conversion depend on temperature, partial pressure, and the concentration of the acid sites of the catalyst. The highest yield in iso-butane was achieved over a catalyst with a low density of acid sites and at low temperature. At higher temperatures, the rate of isomerization decreased in favor of disproportionation and cracking. A mechanistic model for the isomerization is proposed...|$|R

50|$|<b>Mordenite</b> is {{orthorhombic}} (a,b,c unequal & {{all angles}} 90 degree). It crystallizes {{in the form}} of fibrous aggregates, masses, and vertically striated prismatic crystals. It may be colorless, white, or faintly yellow or pink. It has Mohs hardness of 5 and a density of 2.1 g/cm3. When it forms well developed crystals they are hairlike; very long, thin, and delicate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mordenite</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} zeolites in altered volcanic deposits; it is found in volcanic rock such as rhyolite, andesite, and basalt. It is associated with other zeolites such as stilbite and heulandite. Good examples have been found in Iceland, India, Italy, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. It is also found in marine sediments, as in the Ural Mountains and in dikes where water has attacked and altered volcanic glasses, as on the Isle of Arran in Scotland.|$|E
30|$|In general, zeolite, clay, or Prussian blue is {{superior}} to biochar in cesium adsorption. To cite an example, some zeolites and <b>mordenites</b> display nearly 100  % adsorption rates for concentrated solution (Cs+: ca. 500  mg/L) when 0.3  g of the adsorbents is added to 30  mL of the cesium solution [17]. By contrast, for many kinds of charcoal made from woody material, the cesium-adsorption rates range from 35 to 85  % under the same addition amount of charcoal even when a dilute solution (Cs+: 1.0  mg/L) is used and ordinary Japanese oak charcoal shows medium ability to adsorb cesium [7]. However, biochar has a great advantage of reducing its volume markedly by combustion. Moreover, {{it has been reported}} that the cesium-adsorption ability of biochar increases as the production temperature falls [7]. It can, therefore, be expected that Japanese oak charcoal is improved as a practical adsorbent for cesium.|$|R
40|$|Mechanistic and steric {{aspects of}} direct amination of {{methanol}} over Brønsted acidic <b>mordenites</b> were investigated using in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy and kinetic studies. It {{was found that}} the rate of formation of the primary product monomethylamine is linearly correlated to the total concentration of available methyl groups from methylammonium ions rather than the acid site concentration. This indicates scavenging of methyl groups by ammonia and amines {{is likely to be the}} major pathway for amine formation. Differences in selectivity to the different amines, i. e., mono-, di- and trimethylamine, are related to differences in hindrance for the diffusion of the larger molecules. Higher concentration of alkylammonium ions in the pores and higher substitution of sorbed molecules suppress formation of trimethylamine. The selectivity to dimethyl ether seems also to be controlled by such steric factors. Lowering the effective available space for formation and transport retards dimethyl ether formation or leads to more dimethyl ether reacting to amines. A concerted bimolecular mechanism involving weakly sorbed methanol species is proposed to be the main pathway for ether formation...|$|R
40|$|Several {{classes of}} {{molecular}} sieves were investigated as methanol dehydration catalysts for the LPDME{trademark} (liquid-phase dimethyl ether) process. Molecular sieves offer {{a number of}} attractive features as potential catalysts for the conversion of methanol to DME. These include (1) {{a wide range of}} acid strengths, (2) diverse architectures and channel connectivities that provide latitude for steric control, (3) high active site density, (4) well-investigated syntheses and characterization, and (5) commercial availability in some cases. We directed our work in two areas: (1) a general exploration of the catalytic behavior of various classes of molecular sieves in the LPDME{trademark} system and (2) a focused effort to prepare and test zeolites with predominantly Lewis acidity. In our general exploration, we looked at such diverse materials as chabazites, <b>mordenites,</b> pentasils, SAPOs, and ALPOs. Our work with Lewis acidity sought to exploit the structural advantages of zeolites without the interfering effects of deleterious Broensted sites. We used zeolite Ultrastable Y (USY) as our base material because it possesses a high proportion of Lewis acid sites. This work was extended by modifying the USY through ion exchange to try to neutralize residual Broensted acidity...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy is {{currently}} investigating alternative sorbents {{for the removal}} and immobilization of radioiodine from the gas streams in a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. One of these new sorbents, Ag 0 -functionalized silica aerogels, shows great promise as a potential replacement for Ag-bearing <b>mordenites</b> because of its high selectivity and sorption capacity for iodine. Moreover, a feasible consolidation of iodine-loaded Ag 0 -functionalized silica aerogels to a durable SiO 2 -based waste form makes this aerogel an attractive choice for sequestering radioiodine. This report provides a preliminary assessment of the methods {{that can be used}} to consolidate iodine-loaded Ag 0 -functionalized silica aerogels into a final waste form. In particular, it focuses on experimental investigation of densification of as prepared Ag 0 -functionalized silica aerogels powders, with or without organic moiety and with or without sintering additive (colloidal silica), with three commercially available techniques: 1) hot uniaxial pressing (HUP), 2) hot isostatic pressing (HIP), and 3) spark plasma sintering (SPS). The densified products were evaluated with helium gas pycnometer for apparent density, with the Archimedes method for apparent density and open porosity, and with high-resolution scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) for the extent of densification and distribution of individual elements. The preliminary investigation of HUP, HIP, and SPS showed that these sintering methods can effectively consolidate powders of Ag 0 -functionalized silica aerogel into products of near-theoretical density. Also, removal of organic moiety and adding 5. 6 mass% of colloidal silica to Ag 0 -functionalized silica aerogel powders before processing provided denser products. Furthermore, the ram travel data for SPS indicated that rapid consolidation of powders can be performed at temperatures below 950 °C...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{synthesis}} of large <b>mordenite</b> crystals from heterogeneous aluminosilicate reaction mixtures is presented. The method involves heat treatment of porous silica gels in air at elevated temperatures prior to their use in <b>mordenite</b> synthesis. Heat treatment lowers the surface area and pore volume (porosity) of X-ray amorphous porous silica gel particles without substantially changing {{the size of the}} remaining pores. Thus, a decrease in accessibility of the internal surface area of silica to dissolution is realized. The result is nucleation of fewer <b>mordenite</b> crystals which grow larger. The method employed to grow large <b>mordenite</b> crystals also leads to the formation of other crystalline phases (quartz and/or zeolite Pc) coexisting with <b>mordenite,</b> the amounts of which increase with increasing heat treatment temperature of silica. For the investigated composition only large-pore (140 and 150 Å) silica gels resulted in {{the synthesis of}} large <b>mordenite</b> crystals (up to 175 µm) when they were heated to 800 – 900 °C prior to use. The use of heat-treated, medium-pore (60 Å) silica gel in zeolite synthesis resulted in growth of substantially smaller <b>mordenite</b> crystals with size up to 80 µm. Small-pore (22 and 25 Å) silica gels could not be used to grow large <b>mordenite</b> crystals by heating them before use in syntheses. Upon heating at elevated temperatures prior to use, these silica gels resulted in synthesis of predominantly quartz and no significant size increase of <b>mordenite</b> crystals was observed at any heattreatment temperature. It is also shown that the combination of heat and mechanical (grinding) treatments of porous silica allows control of the crystallization and the size of <b>mordenite</b> crystals...|$|E
