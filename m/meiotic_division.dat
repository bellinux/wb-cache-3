25|$|At the meiotic {{metaphase}} I, the cytoskeleton put the bivalents under tension by pulling each homolog in opposite direction (contrary to mitotic division where the forces are exerted on each chromatid). The anchorage of the cytoskeleton to the chromosomes {{takes place at}} the centromere thanks to a protein complex called kinetochore. This tension results in the alignment of the bivalent {{at the center of the}} cell, the chiasmata and the distal cohesion of the sister chromatids being the anchor point sustaining the force exerted on the whole structure. Impressively, human female primary oocytes remains in this tension state for decades (from the establishment of the oocyte in metaphase I during embryonic development, to the ovulation event in adulthood that resume the <b>meiotic</b> <b>division),</b> highlighting the robustness of the chiasma and the cohesion that hold the bivalents together.|$|E
25|$|In {{a process}} called microsporogenesis, four haploid microspores are {{produced}} from each diploid sporogenous cell (microsporocyte, pollen mother cell or meiocyte), after <b>meiotic</b> <b>division.</b> After {{the formation of the}} four microspores, which are contained by callose walls, the development of the pollen grain walls begins. The callose wall is broken down by an enzyme called callase and the freed pollen grains grow in size and develop their characteristic shape and form a resistant outer wall called the exine and an inner wall called the intine. The exine is what is preserved in the fossil record. Two basic types of microsporogenesis are recognised, simultaneous and successive. In simultaneous microsporogenesis meiotic steps I and II are completed prior to cytokinesis, whereas in successive microsporogenesis cytokinesis follows. While there may be a continuum with intermediate forms, the type of microsporogenesis has systematic significance. The predominant form amongst the monocots is successive, but there are important exceptions.|$|E
40|$|Distinct {{classes of}} sporulation-specific genes are {{sequentially}} expressed {{during the process}} of spore formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The transition from expression of early meiotic genes to expression of middle sporulation-specific genes occurs at about the time that cells exit from pachytene and form the meiosis I spindle. To identify genes encoding potential regulators of middle sporulation-specific gene expression, we screened for mutants that expressed early meiotic genes but failed to express middle sporulation-specific genes. We identified mutant alleles of RPD 3, SIN 3, and NDT 80 in this screen. Rpd 3 p, a histone deacetylase, and Sin 3 p are global modulators of gene expression. Ndt 80 p promotes entry into the <b>meiotic</b> <b>divisions.</b> We found that entry into the <b>meiotic</b> <b>divisions</b> was not required for activation of middle sporulation genes; these genes were efficiently expressed in a clb 1 clb 3 clb 4 strain, which fails to enter the <b>meiotic</b> <b>divisions</b> due to reduced Clb-dependent activation of Cdc 28 p kinase. In contrast, middle sporulation genes were not expressed in a dmc 1 strain, which fails to enter the <b>meiotic</b> <b>divisions</b> because a defect in meiotic recombination leads to a RAD 17 -dependent checkpoint arrest. Expression of middle sporulation genes, as well as entry into the <b>meiotic</b> <b>divisions,</b> was restored to a dmc 1 strain by mutation of RAD 17. Our studies also revealed that NDT 80 was a temporally distinct, pre-middle sporulation gene and that its expression was reduced, but not abolished, on mutation of DMC 1, RPD 3, SIN 3, or NDT 80 itself. In summary, our data indicate that Ndt 80 p is required for expression of middle sporulation genes and that the activity of Ndt 80 p is controlled by the meiotic recombination checkpoint. Thus, middle genes are expressed only on completion of meiotic recombination and subsequent generation of an active form of Ndt 80 p...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIn budding yeast, key meiotic {{events such}} as DNA replication, recombination, and the <b>meiotic</b> <b>divisions</b> are {{controlled}} by Clb cyclin-dependent kinases (Clb-CDKs).

40|$|Mature oocytes of Drosophila {{are arrested}} in {{metaphase}} of meiosis I. Upon activation by ovulation or fertilization, oocytes undergo {{a series of}} rapid changes {{that have not been}} directly visualized previously. We report here the use of the Nonclaret disjunctional (Ncd) microtubule motor protein fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) to monitor changes in the meiotic spindle of live oocytes after activation in vitro. Meiotic spindles of metaphase-arrested oocytes are relatively stable, however, meiotic spindles of in vitro–activated oocytes are highly dynamic: the spindles elongate, rotate around their long axis, and undergo an acute pivoting movement to reorient perpendicular to the oocyte surface. Many oocytes spontaneously complete the <b>meiotic</b> <b>divisions,</b> permitting visualization of progression from meiosis I to II. The movements of the spindle after oocyte activation provide new information about the dynamic changes in the spindle that occur upon re-entry into meiosis and completion of the <b>meiotic</b> <b>divisions.</b> Spindles in live oocytes mutant for a lossof-function ncd allele fused to gfp were also imaged. The genesis of spindle defects in the live mutant oocytes provides new insights into the mechanism of Ncd function in the spindle during the <b>meiotic</b> <b>divisions...</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Meiotic</b> <b>division</b> in the VE {{hypothesis}} arose {{because of}} the evolutionary pressures placed on the lysogenic virus {{as a result of}} its inability to enter into the lytic cycle. This selective pressure resulted in the development of processes allowing the viruses to spread horizontally throughout the population. The outcome of this selection was cell-to-cell fusion. (This is distinct from the conjugation methods used by bacterial plasmids under evolutionary pressure, with important consequences.) The possibility of this kind of fusion is supported by the presence of fusion proteins in the envelopes of the pox viruses that allow them to fuse with host membranes. These proteins could have been transferred to the cell membrane during viral reproduction, enabling cell-to-cell fusion between the virus host and an uninfected cell. The theory proposes meiosis originated from the fusion between two cells infected with related but different viruses which recognised each other as uninfected. After the fusion of the two cells, incompatibilities between the two viruses result in a meiotic-like cell division.|$|E
25|$|Triploidy may be {{the result}} of either digyny (the extra haploid set is from the mother) or diandry (the extra haploid set is from the father). Diandry is mostly caused by {{reduplication}} of the paternal haploid set from a single sperm, but may also be the consequence of dispermic (two sperm) fertilization of the egg. Digyny is most commonly caused by either failure of one <b>meiotic</b> <b>division</b> during oogenesis leading to a diploid oocyte or failure to extrude one polar body from the oocyte. Diandry appears to predominate among early miscarriages, while digyny predominates among triploid zygotes that survive into the fetal period. However, among early miscarriages, digyny is also more common in those cases <8.5 weeks gestational age or those in which an embryo is present. There are also two distinct phenotypes in triploid placentas and fetuses that are dependent on the origin of the extra haploid set. In digyny, there is typically an asymmetric poorly grown fetus, with marked adrenal hypoplasia and a very small placenta. In diandry, a partial hydatidiform mole develops. These parent-of-origin effects reflect the effects of genomic imprinting.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe oocyte-to-embryo {{transition}} transforms a differentiated {{germ cell}} into a totipotent zygote capable of somatic development. In C. elegans, several oocyte proteins, including the meiotic katanin subunit MEI- 1 and the oocyte maturation protein OMA- 1, must be degraded during this transition [1]. Degradation of MEI- 1 and OMA- 1 requires the dual-specificity YAK- 1 -related (DYRK) kinase MBK- 2 [2 – 4]. Here, we demonstrate that MBK- 2 directly phosphorylates MEI- 1 and OMA- 1 in vitro {{and that this}} activity is essential for degradation in vivo. Phosphorylation of MEI- 1 by MBK- 2 reaches maximal levels after the <b>meiotic</b> <b>divisions,</b> immediately preceding MEI- 1 degradation. MEI- 1 phosphorylation and degradation still occur in spe- 9 eggs, which undergo meiotic maturation and exit {{in the absence of}} fertilization [5]. In contrast, MEI- 1 phosphorylation and degradation are blocked in cell-cycle mutants that arrest during the <b>meiotic</b> <b>divisions,</b> and are accelerated in wee- 1. 3 (RNAi) oocytes, which prematurely enter meiotic M phase (A. Golden, personal communication). A GFP:MBK- 2 fusion relocalizes from the cortex to the cytoplasm during the <b>meiotic</b> <b>divisions,</b> and this relocalization also depends on cell-cycle progression.

40|$|SummaryDYRKs are kinases that self-activate in vitro by autophosphorylation of a YTY motif in the kinase domain, {{but their}} {{regulation}} in vivo {{is not well}} understood.

The pseudotyrosine phosphatases EGG- 4 and EGG- 5 sequester activated MBK- 2 until the <b>meiotic</b> <b>divisions</b> by binding to the YTY motif and inhibiting MBK- 2 ′s kinase activity directly, using a mixed-inhibition mechanism that does not involve tyrosine dephosphorylation.

Chromatid exchanges occur at a frequency which is very nearly that predicted on the assumption that each chiasma represents an exchange between homologous chromatids. However, the exchanges are randomly distributed among chromosomes in a size group, whereas chiasmata are not. A quantitative analysis of the frequency and pattern of exchanges indicates that most of these result from breakage and reciprocal exchange between homologous chromatids.

40|$|International audienceIn most {{vertebrates}} and invertebrates, {{germ cells}} produce {{female and male}} gametes after one or several rounds of asymmetric cell division. Germline-specific features are used for the asymmetric segregation of fates, chromosomes and size during gametogenesis. In Drosophila females, for example, a germline-specific organelle called the fusome is used repeatedly to polarize the divisions of germline stem cells for their self-renewal, and during the divisions of cyst cells for the specification of the oocyte {{among a group of}} sister cells sharing a common cytoplasm. Later during oogenesis of most species, <b>meiotic</b> <b>divisions</b> produce a striking size asymmetry between a large oocyte and small polar bodies.

40|$|Meiotic cells undergo two {{successive}} divisions {{without an}} intervening S phase. However, {{the mechanism of}} S-phase omission between the two <b>meiotic</b> <b>divisions</b> is largely unknown. Here we show that Wee 1, a universal mitotic inhibitor, is absent in immature (but not mature) Xenopus oocytes, being down-regulated specifically during oogenesis; this down-regulation is most likely due to a translational repression. Even the modest ectopic expression of Wee 1 in immature (meiosis I) oocytes can induce interphase nucleus reformation and DNA replication just after meiosis I. Thus, the presence of Wee 1 during meiosis I converts the meiotic cell cycle into a mitotic-like cell cycle having S phase. In contrast, Myt 1, a Wee 1 -related kinase, is present and directly involved in G 2 arrest of immature oocytes, but its ectopic expression has {{little effect on the}} meiotic cell cycle. These results strongly indicate that the absence of Wee 1 in meiosis I ensures the meiotic cell cycle in Xenopus oocytes.
