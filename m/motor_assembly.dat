5|$|After {{descending}} into Burlington, the QEW crosses former Highway2 {{before it}} encounters the Freeman Interchange, opened in 1958 to allow construction of Highway403 and expanded in 1999 to accommodate Highway407. The freeway curves to the east, becoming concurrent with Highway403 through Burlington and Oakville within Halton Region. The two routes travel east straight though a commercial office area. Service roads reappear through this stretch to serve businesses fronting the highway. The segment includes high-occupancy vehicle lanes, opened in 2011, which required {{the construction of}} a second structure over Sixteen Mile Creek. In the eastern end of Oakville, the route curves northeast, passing the Ford <b>Motor</b> <b>Assembly</b> Plant. Highway403 diverges and travels north as the QEW curves back to the east and enters Mississauga and Peel Region.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1955, {{with the}} {{construction}} of the Ford <b>Motor</b> <b>Assembly</b> Plant, and accelerating in the 1960s and 1970s, extensive residential and retail development took place. Hayfields in Milpitas rapidly disappeared as industries and residential housing developments spread. Soon, the once rural town of Milpitas found itself a San Jose suburb. The population jumped from about 800 in 1950 to 62,698 in 2000. Several local farmers and businessmen who had chipped in from $2 to $50 to file for incorporation, had become millionaires within ten years. Most of them then moved away.|$|E
500|$|A second {{challenge}} {{was how to}} overcome {{the rotation of the}} suspended parts – the sub-chassis, platter, arm and cartridge – relative to the motor. This was done by re-imagining a suspension that had less freedom of lateral movement relative to the drive motor. The Xerxes uses a relatively light medium-density fibreboard (MDF) top board on which the bearing and tonearm assemblies are mounted. Firm rubber [...] "Blobs" [...] mounted on the bottom board (along with the <b>motor</b> <b>assembly)</b> support yet decouple from the top board. Aesthetically, the two boards are encased by a wooden surround fixed to the base board with screws. These design principles can be seen throughout the evolution of the Xerxes, right through to the Xerxes 20plus.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Xerxes {{design is}} deliberately {{a radical departure}} from the traditional suspended sub-chassis design. Instead of having a three-point sprung suspension separating the plinth from the sub-chassis, the Xerxes is made up of two boards separated from each other by stiff rubber [...] "Blobs". The top plinth sees mountings for the main bearing and tonearm. A hole is cut out from the top board for the <b>motor</b> <b>assembly</b> to emerge from its fixture on the board below. On the lower board, to which an outer surround is attached, three compliant rubber feet give additional isolation to the turntable's chosen placement. One notable characteristic of the deck is the large C-shaped groove cut into the top plinth to control how vibrations would be transmitted from platter to the tonearm area. However, the cut-out is prone to a commonly observed [...] "plinth sag", where the part of it would bend out of true {{with the rest of the}} board.|$|E

5000|$|Nissan/Datsun {{responded to}} the government's call for {{industrialisation}} by exporting completely knocked down (CKD) kits from Japan to Malaysia, where they were assembled at the newly constructed Capital <b>Motor</b> <b>Assembly</b> plant in Tampoi, Johor. Several Datsun engineers assisted in the training of the local employees on technical skills at the plant. The first Malaysian-assembled Datsun rolled off the factory floor in June 1968. Prices for the locally assembled Datsuns were reduced and sales improved significantly in the following years. However, in 1971, Capital <b>Motor</b> <b>Assembly</b> was sold to General Motors, and Datsun production was shifted to the Swedish Motor Assemblies (SMA) plant in Shah Alam, Selangor.|$|E

50|$|Construction of the Swedish <b>Motor</b> <b>Assemblies</b> plant {{commenced}} in March 1967 in {{an industrial}} estate in Batu Tiga, near Shah Alam. Construction was hampered by the 1967 Suez crisis and other issues, but was completed on schedule in October 1967. The Volvo 144 became the first model to roll-off the SMA assembly line in November 1967. The Minister of Transport, Sardon Jubir, test drove the first Malaysian-assembled Volvo the following month. The Minister of Commerce and Industry, Lim Swee Aun, officially opened the Swedish <b>Motor</b> <b>Assemblies</b> plant on 17 February 1968.|$|R

50|$|When a Tainter gate is closed, water bears on the convex (upstream) side. When {{the gate}} is rotated, {{the rush of}} water passing under the gate helps to open and close the gate.

Vertical capstans use a vertical shaft, with the motor and gearbox situated below the winch unit (usually below decks).|$|E
