25|$|Multicast bundles {{are sent}} from one CobraNet device {{to all other}} CobraNet devices in the network using Ethernet <b>multicast</b> <b>addressing.</b> Each CobraNet device {{individually}} determines if it will use the bundle or discard it. Therefore, multicast bundles are more bandwidth-intensive than other bundle types. Bundle numbers 1–255 are reserved for multicast bundles.|$|E
25|$|Private bundles may be sent with unicast or <b>multicast</b> <b>addressing.</b> Bundle numbers 65280–65535 are {{reserved}} for private bundles. Private bundle numbers are paired with the MAC address of the device that transmits them. To receive a private bundle, both the bundle number and the MAC address of the transmitter must be specified. Because 256 private bundles available to each transmitter, there is no limit on the total number private bundles on a network.|$|E
25|$|OSPF {{does not}} use a {{transport}} protocol, such as UDP or TCP, but encapsulates its data directly in IP packets with protocol number 89. This {{is in contrast to}} other routing protocols, such as the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). OSPF implements its own transport layer error detection and correction functions. OSPF uses <b>multicast</b> <b>addressing</b> for distributing route information within a broadcast domain. OSPF reserves the multicast addresses 224.0.0.5 (IPv4) and FF02::5 (IPv6) for all SPF/link state routers (AllSPFRouters) and 224.0.0.6 (IPv4) and FF02::6 (IPv6) for all Designated Routers (AllDRouters). For non-broadcast networks, special provisions for configuration facilitate neighbor discovery. OSPF multicast IP packets never traverse IP routers, they never travel more than one hop. The virtual link feature can be used to create an adjacency tunnel across multiple hops. The OSPF protocols gathers information regarding all link states in the domain in its link state database, and is thus not a link layer protocol itself, but is – based on the purpose of the protocol; to exchange and calculate optimal paths through the network for IP destination addresses – most correctly classified as an Internet layer protocol. The OSPF protocol, when running on IPv4, can operate securely between routers, optionally using a variety of authentication methods to allow only trusted routers to participate in routing. OSPFv3, running on IPv6, does not support protocol-internal authentication. Instead, it relies on IPv6 protocol security (IPsec).|$|E
50|$|<b>Multicast</b> <b>addresses</b> in IPv6 use the prefix ff00::/8. IPv6 <b>multicast</b> <b>addresses</b> {{can be made}} {{up using}} the old format (RFC 2373) or the new format (RFC 3306, updated by RFC 7371).The prefix holds the value ff for all <b>multicast</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> is {{also used}} by {{multiple}} hosts, which acquire the <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> destination by participating in the multicast distribution protocol among the network routers. A packet that is sent to a <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> is delivered to all interfaces that have joined the corresponding multicast group.|$|R
50|$|The sc(ope) field {{holds the}} binary value 0010 (link-local).Solicited-node <b>multicast</b> <b>addresses</b> are {{computed}} {{as a function}} of a node's unicast or anycast <b>addresses.</b> A solicited-node <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> is created by copying the last 24 bits of a unicast or anycast address to the last 24 bits of the <b>multicast</b> <b>address.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Unicast bundles {{are sent}} from one CobraNet device {{to any other}} device or devices {{configured}} to receive the bundle number. [...] Unicast bundles are much more efficient because network switches route them only to devices which actually want to receive them. Despite their name, unicast bundles may still be sent to multiple devices, either by transmitting multiple copies of the audio data or using <b>multicast</b> <b>addressing.</b> Bundle numbers 256–65279 are reserved for unicast bundles.|$|E
50|$|IPv6 {{addresses}} {{are classified}} by the primary addressing and routing methodologies common in networking: unicast addressing, anycast addressing, and <b>multicast</b> <b>addressing.</b>|$|E

50|$|A Solicited-Node <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> is an IPv6 <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> valid {{within the}} local-link (e.g. an Ethernet segment or a Frame Relay cloud). Every IPv6 host will {{have at least}} one such address per interface. Solicited-Node <b>multicast</b> <b>{{addresses}}</b> are used in Neighbor Discovery Protocol for obtaining the layer 2 link-layer addresses of other nodes.|$|R
50|$|The 239.0.0.0/8 {{range is}} {{assigned}} by RFC 2365 for private use within an organization. From the RFC, packets destined to administratively scoped IPv4 <b>multicast</b> <b>addresses</b> do not cross administratively defined organizational boundaries, and administratively scoped IPv4 <b>multicast</b> <b>addresses</b> are locally assigned {{and do not}} have to be globally unique. The RFC also discusses structuring the 239.0.0.0/8 range to be loosely similar to the scoped IPv6 <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> range described in RFC 1884.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the state}} of the sending {{interface}} and the source of the advertisements being acknowledged, a Link State Acknowledgment packet is sent either to the <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> AllSPFRouters, to the <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> AllDRouters, or as a unicast.|$|R

50|$|<b>Multicast</b> <b>addressing</b> uses a one-to-many-of-many or many-to-many-of-many association; {{datagrams}} are routed {{simultaneously in}} a single transmission to many recipients. It differs from broadcast in that the destination address designates a subset, not necessarily all, of the accessible nodes.|$|E

Firstly, the client sends the record request to ControlServer via the secure control channel. Then, ControlServer inserts the media information, including session information, <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> of the session, Synchronization SouRCe (SSRC) identifier, and so forth, into AdmireDB. Finally, ControlServer asks RPServer to record media data in the specified <b>multicast</b> <b>address</b> (the client can also require RPS to record data with specified SSRC in a <b>multicast</b> <b>address).</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{successor}} to Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4), IPv6 {{also does not}} implement the broadcast method, so as to prevent disturbing all nodes in a network when only a few {{may be interested in}} a particular service.

However, multicasting limits the pool of receivers to those that join a specific multicast receiver group.|$|E
50|$|IPv6 {{provides}} other technical {{benefits in}} addition to a larger addressing space. In particular, it permits hierarchical address allocation methods that facilitate route aggregation across the Internet, and thus limit the expansion of routing tables.
