5|$|Valence 3 is {{dominant}} in all subsequent elements up to lawrencium (with {{the possible exception}} of nobelium). Curium can be tetravalent in solids (fluoride, dioxide). Berkelium, along with a valence of +3, also shows the valence of +4, <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> that of curium; the valence 4 is observed in solid fluoride and dioxide. The stability of Bk4+ in aqueous solution is close to that of Ce4+. Only valence 3 was observed for californium, einsteinium and fermium. The divalent state is proven for mendelevium and nobelium, and in nobelium it is <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> the trivalent state. Lawrencium shows valence 3 both in solutions and solids.|$|E

5|$|Astatine is an {{extremely}} radioactive element; all its isotopes have short half-lives of 8.1 hours or less, decaying into other astatine isotopes, bismuth, polonium or radon. Most of its isotopes are very unstable with half-lives of one second or less. Of the first 101 elements in the periodic table, only francium is less stable, and all the astatine isotopes <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> francium are in any case synthetic and do not occur in nature.|$|E
5|$|However, not all inhibitors {{are based}} on the {{structures}} of substrates. For example, the structure of another HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir is shown on the left. This molecule is not based on a peptide and has no obvious structural similarity to a protein substrate. These non-peptide inhibitors can be <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> inhibitors containing peptide bonds, because they will not be substrates for peptidases and {{are less likely to be}} degraded.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of fermium {{has only been}} studied in solution using tracer techniques, and no solid compounds have been prepared. Under normal conditions, fermium exists in solution as the Fm3+ ion, which has a hydration number of 16.9 and an acid dissociation constant of 1.6 (pKa= 3.8). Fm3+ forms complexes {{with a wide variety}} of organic ligands with hard donor atoms such as oxygen, and these complexes are usually <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> those of the preceding actinides. It also forms anionic complexes with ligands such as chloride or nitrate and, again, these complexes appear to be <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> those formed by einsteinium or californium. It is believed that the bonding in the complexes of the later actinides is mostly ionic in character: the Fm3+ ion is expected to be smaller than the preceding An3+ ions because of the higher effective nuclear charge of fermium, and hence fermium would be expected to form shorter and stronger metal–ligand bonds.|$|E
5|$|At least 32 {{metastable}} isomers {{have been}} characterized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 197. The most stable {{of these is}} 192m2Ir, which decays by isomeric transition with a half-life of 241years, making it <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> any of iridium's synthetic isotopes in their ground states. The least stable isomer is 190m3Ir with a half-life of only 2µs. The isotope 191Ir {{was the first one}} of any element to be shown to present a Mössbauer effect. This renders it useful for Mössbauer spectroscopy for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.|$|E

5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} nobelium behaves as a heavier homolog to ytterbium in the periodic table. The chemical properties of nobelium are not completely known: they are mostly only known in aqueous solution. Before nobelium's discovery, {{it was predicted that}} it would show a stable +2 oxidation state as well as the +3 state characteristic of the other actinides: these predictions were later confirmed, as the +2 state is much <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> the +3 state in aqueous solution {{and it is difficult to}} keep nobelium in the +3 state.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{fluoride}} is {{the only}} alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide {{is the only}} alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Conversely, lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li+ has a high solvation energy. This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic: this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide {{to be used in}} dehumidifiers and air-conditioners.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{complexes}} tend to {{be similar}} to those of its lighter homologue copper. Silver(III) complexes {{tend to be}} rare and very easily reduced to the more stable lower oxidation states, though they are slightly <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> those of copper(III). For instance, the square planar periodate 5− and tellurate 5− complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver(I) with alkaline peroxodisulfate. The yellow diamagnetic − is much less stable, fuming in moist air and reacting with glass.|$|E

5|$|Strangelets {{are small}} {{fragments}} of strange matter—a hypothetical form of quark matter—that contain roughly {{equal numbers of}} up, down, and strange quarks and that are <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> ordinary nuclei (strangelets would {{range in size from}} a few femtometers to a few meters across). If strangelets can actually exist, and if they were produced at the LHC, they could conceivably initiate a runaway fusion process in which all the nuclei in the planet would be converted to strange matter, similar to a strange star.|$|E
5|$|The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory {{attempted}} to synthesize the isotope 271Mt in 2002–2003 {{for a possible}} chemical investigation of meitnerium because {{it was expected that}} it might be <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> the isotopes around it as it has 162 neutrons, a magic number for deformed nuclei; its half-life was predicted to be a few seconds, long enough for a chemical investigation.

5|$|The oxides and {{hydroxides}} of neptunium {{are closely}} related to its ions. In general, Np hydroxides at various oxidation levels are less stable than the actinides before it on the periodic table such as thorium and uranium and <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> those after it such as plutonium and americium. This phenomenon is because the stability of an ion increases as the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases. Thus actinides higher on the periodic table will more readily undergo hydrolysis.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} reduction {{potential of}} the E°(No3+→No2+) couple was estimated in 1967 to be between +1.4and+1.5V; it was later found in 2009 to be only about +0.75V. The positive value shows that No2+ is <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> No3+ and that No3+ is a good oxidizing agent. While the quoted values for the E°(No2+→No0) and E°(No3+→No0) vary among sources, the accepted standard estimates are −2.61and−1.26V. It has been predicted that the value for the E°(No4+→No3+) couple would be +6.5V. The Gibbs energies of formation for No3+ and No2+ {{are estimated to be}} −342and−480kJ·mol−1, respectively.|$|E
5|$|All {{copernicium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are <b>more</b> <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> the lighter. The most stable isotope, 285Cn, has a half-life of 29seconds; 283Cn has a half-life of 4seconds, and the unconfirmed 286Cn has a half-life of about 8.45seconds. Other isotopes have half-lives shorter than 0.1seconds. 281Cn and 284Cn both have half-lives of 97ms, {{and the other}} two isotopes have half-lives slightly under one millisecond. It is predicted that the heavy isotopes 291Cn and 293Cn may have half-lives longer than a few decades, and may have been produced in the r-process and be detectable in cosmic rays, though they would be about 10−12 times as abundant as lead.|$|E

The remaining two isotopes have half-lives between 0.1 and 100milliseconds: 282Nh has a half-life of 70milliseconds, and 278Nh, the lightest known nihonium isotope, is also the shortest-lived known nihonium isotope, with a half-life of just 1.4milliseconds. It is predicted that even heavier undiscovered nihonium isotopes could be much more stable: for example, 287Nh is predicted to have a half-life of around 20minutes, close to two orders of magnitude more than that of 286Nh.|$|E
50|$|Pheomelanin is <b>more</b> bio-chemically <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> black eumelanin, {{but less}} bio-chemically <b>stable</b> <b>than</b> brown eumelanin, so it breaks down more slowly when oxidized.
