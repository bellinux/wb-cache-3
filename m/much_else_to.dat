25|$|The {{appointment}} of new Queen's Counsel was suspended in 2003, {{and it was}} widely expected that the system would be abolished. However, a vigorous campaign was mounted in defence of the system. Supporters included those who considered it as an independent indication of excellence of value to those (especially foreign commercial litigants) {{who did not have}} <b>much</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> go on, and those who contended that it was a means whereby the most able barristers from ethnic minorities could advance and overcome prejudice, as well as better represent members of an increasingly diverse society.|$|E

500|$|The {{technical}} aspects of the game, such as the graphics and animation, received acclaim. IGN's Douglass C. Perry felt that the graphics and motion capture are [...] "exceptional", and the animation is [...] "beautiful", as well as praising the stable frame rate. Ryan Davis of GameSpot wrote that the characters were designed with [...] "phenomenal detail", though felt that [...] "there's not <b>much</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> look at". GamesRadar's Dan Amrich commended the game's player models and lighting effects, stating that they [...] "put the hardware to impressive yet playful use". Tom Orry of VideoGamer.com felt that the visuals improve the gameplay, particularly applauding smaller details such as the player models and ball physics.|$|E

Young people who are the major movie audience today, refer to that as the plastic world and that is almost a deterrent in the business today." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon Ninja Gaidens North American release, Nintendo of America, whose play-testers {{liked the}} game and gave it high ratings, decided to help with its marketing. It was {{featured}} prominently in Nintendo's house organ Nintendo Power; according to Criona, {{it did not take}} a lot of effort to market the game through the magazine, nor did Tecmo or Nintendo do <b>much</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> promote it. The game's demand eventually exceeded its supply. While Tecmo anticipated that the game would be a hit, they did not realize at the time its impact it would have in the video game industry, according to Kohler, [...] "with its groundbreaking use of cinematics". Yoshizawa would go on to direct the sequel [...] (1990) and remained as an executive producer for [...] (1991), while Masato Kato took over directing the game design.|$|E

50|$|Vidali is {{believed}} to have used the revolver he commonly carried to murder Mella, rather than the M1911 pistol that Modotti kept in her house. The assassination took place in Mexico City on January 10, 1929, one month after Mella was expelled from the Mexican Communist Party for association with Trotskyists. Mella had rejoined the party just two weeks prior to his death, although this circumstance -like <b>much</b> <b>else</b> related <b>to</b> Vidali- is murky.|$|R
500|$|Cosimo, {{not having}} <b>much</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do, instituted more moral laws. Young men {{were not allowed}} to [...] "enter into houses to make love to girls, and let them dally at doors and windows, is a great {{incentive}} to rapes, abortions, and infanticides..." [...] If a man did not comply, he was liable to receive enormous fines. This coincided with a new wave of taxes that stagnated Tuscany's already declining economy. Harold Acton recounts that a bale of wool [...] "sent from Leghorn and Cortona had to pass though ten intermediate customs." [...] The Grand Duke oversaw the establishment of the Office of Public Decency, whose goal was to regulate prostitution, also. Prostitutes were oft thrown into the Stinche, a jail for women of that profession, for years, with scant food, if they could not afford the fines levied on them by the Office of Public Decency. Evening permits and exemptions were available for those willing to pay six crowns per month.|$|E
500|$|Neither Carter nor Duchovny were {{contracted}} {{to work on}} the series beyond the seventh season; however, Fox entered into negotiations near the end of season in order to bring the two on board for an eighth season. After the airing of [...] "Requiem", Duchovny expressed his intentions to leave the series. He explained, [...] "I was kind of a free agent after season seven, and to me, there was not <b>much</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do in terms of the character.

[...] Rumors began spreading—and were eventually confirmed—that, since Duchovny had not expressed an interest to appear as a main character in the eighth season, that another character would take Mulder's place. Many fans on the internet believed that Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, would take the role; Pileggi later called this guess [...] "ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|Because {{there was}} still a chance that the seventh season may have been the show's last, the {{character}} of Billy Miles, played by Zachary Ansley and who originally appeared in the pilot episode, was brought back in and featured in [...] "Requiem" [...] to bring the series full-circle. Ansley would also appear in several eighth season episodes as well. After the conclusion of the episode, David Duchovny expressed his desire to leave the series. He explained, [...] "I was kind of a free agent after season seven, and to me, there was not <b>much</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do in terms of the character.

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode a 7.9 out of 10 rating, {{and said that}} Hooks' role as Jenna's mother [...] "helped the half hour, but this Jenna-centric episode still didn't blow me away." [...] He noted that the main plot had funny moments but [...] "there wasn't <b>much</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> invest in." [...] Overall, Canning reasoned that this episode {{was very much a}} stand-alone one [...] "built for some good jokes, and not exactly focused on storytelling. [...] An episode like 'Verna' can still bring a lot of laughs, but you can't help but feel like it's missing that extra something." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger disliked both stories from [...] "Verna", and wrote that it was a disappointing episode, and that it was [...] "pretty weak overall." [...] Meredith Blake, a contributor from the Los Angeles Times, reported that despite Hooks' hilarious performance, the episode still felt a [...] "little bit like filler", and that there [...] "wasn't too much that was especially funny or memorable about it".|$|E
500|$|The {{theatrical}} poster {{for the film}} was released in early August 2013. Kirsten Acuna of Business Insider criticized the poster for its lack of originality, noting its similarities {{to one of the}} posters of Iron Man 3, both of which included the female lead clinging to the male lead, with both looking in opposite directions, antagonists prominently displayed in the background and supporting characters featured [...] "on the side". Additionally, Marvel released a second trailer for the film as part of YouTube's Geek Week. Forbes said, [...] "this 150-second trailer is basically just an extended version of last April's 106-second teaser" [...] and that [...] "this trailer fails to showcase what's new this time around... making audiences question if they really don't have <b>much</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> offer." [...] The Los Angeles Times said, that the trailer suggests [...] "an ominous, epic scale for the sequel" [...] and that [...] "the collaboration between Thor and Loki promises to be especially interesting." [...] Later in the month, producer Kevin Feige and cast members Tom Hiddleston, Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins presented additional footage at Disney's D23 Expo.|$|E

Although the song has a thundering chorus, the kind that sounds truly {{excellent}} blasting through FM speakers, there is quite literally not <b>much</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> the song: of the song's nearly four-minute length, over half of the song is devoted to repeats of the chorus and an unimaginative instrumental breakdown that leads into a seemingly endless vamp on the chorus to fade." ...|$|E

[...] And he summarizes the medical treatment that Van Gogh received from his various doctors thus: [...] "The overall assessment is rather that they did as well as expected with an unfamiliar disease and a difficult patient." ...|$|R
2500|$|New York Times critic Manohla Dargis, who {{designated}} the film a New York Times critics' pick, {{said that the}} film [...] "shows {{the dark side of}} that war. It shows the unspeakable and lets us decide if the death of Bin Laden was worth the price we paid." [...] Continued Dargis: There is <b>much</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> say about the movie, which ends with the harrowing siege of Bin Laden's hideaway by the Navy SEALs (played by, among others, Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt), much of it shot to approximate the queasy, weirdly unreal green of night-vision goggles. Ms. Bigelow's direction here is unexpectedly stunning, at once bold and intimate: she has a genius for infusing even large-scale action set pieces with the human element. One of the most significant images is of a pool of blood on a floor. It's pitiful, really, and as the movie heads toward its emphatically non-triumphant finish, it is impossible not to realize with anguish that all that came before– the pain, the suffering and the compromised ideals– has led to this.|$|E
2500|$|Vigilante 8 Arcade was {{announced}} on February 14, 2008. The game's developer, Isopod Labs, {{consists of three}} key individuals responsible {{for much of the}} production of the original Vigilante 8. The studio consisted of just six individuals and a small number of art contractors, and the title's development was self-funded. Isopod Labs originally looked to a June 2008 release; however, the game was not originally submitted for Xbox Live certification until August 12, 2008. Testers found issues on Microsoft's end in relation to the QNet code library. The issue was resolved by both parties and the game was sent back to Microsoft for resubmission. [...] "We certainly wish it was a quicker process," [...] said Isopod Labs, [...] "but this is how the cookie crumbles — not <b>much</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do, but wait." [...] In a post-release interview with Joystiq Isopod Labs' Adrian Stephens added [...] "The certification issue is a tricky one and more could be done to smooth the path towards certification." [...] Vigilante 8 Arcade passed Microsoft's Xbox Live certification on September 24, 2008, and was released November 5, 2008.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{case for}} {{occupational}} licensing, whether for physicians or teeth whiteners, is highly problematic. This paper {{makes the case}} for a free market system in certification of quality in medical and dental care, and <b>much</b> <b>else.</b> Purpose: <b>To</b> explore occupational licensure as an infringement of liberty. Design/methodology/approach: a logical and empirical analysis. Findings: teeth whitening regulations serve as an anti-competitive barrier to entry. Originality/value: applying the concept of entry restrictions is not original; applying them to teeth whitening, is. This is of value in that for economic liberty to be promoted, schemes against it such as this one must be analyzed and exposed...|$|R
