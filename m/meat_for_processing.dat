40|$|Two {{types of}} {{processed}} products, chopped hams (0. 15 % and 0. 30 % phosphate on final yield) and viennas (27 and 32 % fat extension) were manufactured from ostrich fan fillets (M. iliofibularis) {{to determine the}} suitability of ostrich <b>meat</b> <b>for</b> <b>processing</b> purposes. Cooking losses differed significantly (P 0. 10) between {{the two types of}} ostrich viennas. Colour evaluation (L*,a*,b*) of the fresh ostrich meat and processed ostrich products (chopped hams and viennas) indicated significant differences between the different types of viennas. Chemical composition (moisture, ash, protein and fat content) of the ostrich meat, processed ostrich products and similar types of commercially available products suggested that processed ostrich products can be formulated to compete successfully with similar types of products derived from other meat species. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Key words: formulation, production process layout, food and biological value People’s {{state of health}} is determined by their nutrition.

40|$|In this work, {{the level}} of {{microbial}} contamination of pork and beef <b>meat</b> <b>for</b> <b>processing</b> of heat-untreated fermented meat products was monitored. In company providing samples for this work, meat was kept frozen for period of 6 days (144 hours), which was not effective due to the financialy expensive frozing storages. The relationship between meat freezing period and number of selected technological as well as hygienical significant microorganisms was monitored, with the aim to optimize frozing period to keep microbial quality of meat and meat products. Microbiological analysis of meat samples was performed before freezing of meat and after 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 hours of freezing. Furthermore, the analysis was carried out after 7 and 21 days of meat products storing period. Total number of microorganisms, total number of psychrotrophic microorganisms, yeast and fungi, co­li­forms, bacteria of the genus Enterococcus and bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae were detected. As from results, sufficient period for meat freezing was 72 hours. After this period total count of microorganisms as well as bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms bacteria and bacteria of the genus Enterococcus reached the level, which at next freezing was not influenced. Number of psychrotrophic microorganisms were growing by next prolonging of freezing period, above 72 hours. Numbers of yeast and moulds became almost unchanged during the whole freezing period...|$|E

40|$|All cattle {{slaughtered}} {{at an age}} {{older than}} 24 months have to be tested mandatorily for BSE in Germany. Samples are taken from the brainstem. Given, that prions can occure in the body before being transfered to the brain, unrecognised infected cattle might represent a risk. To minimise that risk, Specified Risk Materials  which are defined by the regulation (EC) 999 / 2001  have to be removed after slaughtering. However, there is residual nervous tissue that is not governed by this regulation. One of those is the sympathetic trunk with its ganglia {{as a part of}} the autonomous nervous system. To estimate the risk from these ganglia, their way during slaughter and cutting procedures was observed. Thirty seven cutting plants in Northern Germany were visited and data from 160 workers were taken. Cutting plants were characterised with regard to their capacity: small (cutting capacity under 10 tons per week), middle size (cutting capacity between 10 and 99 tons per week) and large plants (cuttig capacity 100 and more tons per week). For reasons of reproducibility, the trunk was separated into five parts during observation (T 1, T 2 -T 6, T 7 -T 13, L 1 -L 6, S 1 -S 5). During cutting, ganglia containing tissues could be sorted into eight different boxes (<b>meat</b> <b>for</b> <b>processing,</b> other meat for consumption, fat for consumption, fat for other use, bones-industry, bones-consumption, bones-SRM, bones-disposal). Every worker was observed three times, the results were recorded in an observation sheet. The tissues were not sorted in the same way. Whereas the rear thoracic ganglia (T 7 -T 13) and sacral ganglia (S 1 -S 5) mostly remained in natural connection with the column bones and were littered as SRM, the ganglion stellatum (T 1), the front thoracic ganglia (T 2 -T 6) and also the lumbal ganglia (L 1 -L 6) went into the food chain in different percentages. There was an obvious difference between cutting plants of different capacities. In addition, there was a difference between workers from the same plant in more than half of all visited plants. Either the workers of one plant sorted differently, or one worker acted differently during the observation period. Such differences were observed more frequently in large cutting plants than in smaller ones. To minimize the differences as much as possible, standardisation is needed. Due to the fact that the majority of beef would be produced in large plants, standard operation prescriptions should be introduced in particular in these large premises. Because of its size and after observation of the cutting procedure, in particular the stellate ganglia (T 1) should be put on the list of SRM. For the other thoracic ganglia (T 2 -T 13) and the sacral ganglia (S 1 -S 5) standard operation prescriptions for the removal of the musculature that is associated with the spine and the removal of the transverse processes of the vertebraes are needed. The lumbal ganglia (L 1 -L 6) are hidden between the connective and fat tissues of the filet chain. They could not be taken away in practise. The risk coming from these ganglia should be tolerated...|$|E

Generally, OE at level of 150 ppm {{was the most}} effective decreasing TBARS, and total carbonyl values {{compared to the other}} treatments. Furthermore, it showed better color values (L* and a*) in term of meat color stability. However, OE and E- 250 also showed the highest significant values among the other treatments.

The breast muscle was more suited to processing that the thigh, particularly with regards to texture.   Genotype was the most significant production factor <b>for</b> <b>processing</b> capabilities: broiler-type birds produced meat which gave higher soaked and cooked yields, was less tough and improved meat bind.   Generally, older animals produced <b>meat</b> less suitable <b>for</b> <b>processing.</b>   Diet {{had little effect on}} the processing capability of the meat. The addition of salt and phosphates to poultry meat had a more significant effect on processing behaviour than any animal production factor.   Phosphate increased the soaked and cooked yield, reduced toughness and increased meat bind.   Salt improved the processing performance more than phosphate.   Salt and phosphates added together improved processing performance more than either alone.   This synergistic result was independent of animal production factors. These findings indicate that muscle location, genotype and bird age are the most significant animal production factors.   Additionally, salt and phosphate affect the processing capability of meat more than any of the animal production factors.   Muscle fibre type has no affect on meat processing capability.   Microscopic observations suggest that protein dispersion, decrease in porosity and void size increased cooked yield and meat binding.   The electrophoresis results showed that actin and myosin are the two proteins most dispersed by the action of salt and phosphate.

A survey instrument was constructed and administered resulting in a total of 39 usable surveys for analysis. Preliminary analysis of the data was followed by an ordinary least squares regression to determine cost increasing or decreasing practices and attributes of the small processors. It was determined that on average small meat processors face a per ton variable cost of $ 914. 71 or $ 0. 46 per pound. Regression analysis indicated that plants can benefit from economies of scale. It was also determined there are no cost savings from being a state inspected as opposed to a federally inspected plant.
