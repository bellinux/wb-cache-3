5|$|UK {{department}} store retailer Debenhams' collaboration with designers, launched in 1993 under their Designers at Debenhams range, was a success. Hoping to recapture {{some of their}} lost market share, Marks and Spencer (M) asked Everest to review their menswear range. As Creative Consultant, he designed the Sartorial suiting line for their menswear collection. In October 2000, he designed the Autograph suiting line. Noting that the <b>M</b> <b>range</b> consisted of Italian-style suiting, he aimed to achieve a more 'British' look from the cut, fit and styling and by using different fabrics and colours. He also has responsibility for their Luxury collection. During M advertising campaigns, his designs for the Autograph range have been modelled by several British celebrities, including David Beckham, Bryan Ferry, Jimmy Carr, Martin Freeman, Bob Mortimer and Take That. In 2007, M were selected by The Football Association as 'Official Tailor to the England football team' and Everest designed the team's official suits for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{examine the}} effect of {{ibutilide}} on novel indexes of repolarization in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: We studied consecutive patients scheduled for elective electrical cardioversion. Intravenous ibutilide (1 + 1 mg) was administered before the electrical cardioversion while close electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring was performed. ECG indexes such as corrected QT interval (QTc), the interval from the peak until the end of T wave (Tpe), and the Tpe/QT ratio were measured before ibutilide infusion and 10 min after the end of infusion. RESULTS: The final study population consisted of 20 patients (mean age: 67. 1 1; 9. 9 years, 10 men). Six patients were cardioverted pharmacologically and did not proceed to electrical cardioversion. Two patients developed short non-sustained episodes of torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia. All but one of the aforementioned ECG indexes increased significantly after ibutilide administration. In specific, the QTc interval increased from 442 1; 29 to 471 1; 37 ms (P = 0. 037), the Tpe interval in precordial leads from 96 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 80 - 108 ms) to 101 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 91 - 119 ms) (P = 0. 021), the Tpe interval in lead II from 79 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 70 - 88 ms) to 100 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 87 - 104 ms) (P < 0. 001), the Tpe/QT ratio in precordial leads from 0. 23 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 0. 18 - 0. 26 ms) to 0. 26 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 0. 23 - 0. 28 ms) (P = 0. 028), and the Tpe interval dispersion from 25 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 23 - 30 ms) to 35 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 27 - 39 ms) (P = 0. 012). However, the Tpe/QT ratio in lead II did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: Ibutilide increases the duration and dispersion of ventricular repolarization. The prognostic value of Tpe and Tpe/QT in the setting of drug-induced proarrhythmia needs further study...|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) distribution in the Western Arctic Ocean was performed during {{the spring and summer}} of 2002 and the summer of 2003. DOC concentrations were compared between the three cruises and with previously reported Arctic work. Concentrations of DOC were highest in the surface water where they also showed the highest degree of variability spatially, seasonally, and annually. Over the Canada Basin, DOC concentrations in the main water masses were: (1) surface layer (71 ± 4 ?<b>M,</b> <b>ranging</b> from 50 to 90 ?M); (2) Bering Sea winter water (66 ± 2 ?<b>M,</b> <b>ranging</b> from 58 to 75 ?M); (3) halocline layer (63 ± 3 ?<b>M,</b> <b>ranging</b> from 59 to 68 ?M), (4) Atlantic layer (53 ± 2 ?<b>M,</b> <b>ranging</b> from 48 to 57 ?M), and (5) deep Arctic layer (47 ± 1 ?<b>M,</b> <b>ranging</b> from 45 to 50 ?M). In the upper 200 m, DOC concentrations were correlated with salinity, with higher DOC concentrations present in less-saline waters. This correlation indicates the strong influence that fluvial input from the Mackenzie and Yukon Rivers had on the DOC system in the upper layer of the Chukchi Sea and Bering Strait. Over the deep basin, there appeared to be a relationship between DOC in the upper 10 m and the degree of sea-ice melt water present. We found that sea-ice melt water dilutes the DOC signal in the surface waters, which is contrary to studies conducted in the central Arctic Ocean...|$|R
40|$|Selective {{modification}} of atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction, that is, induction of {{varying degrees of}} AV nodal delays or block (second or third degree), or both, was achieved with a pervenous laser catheter technique. In six adult mongrel dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital (Nembutal), 5 F leads were placed through femoral and external jugular veins and placed into the right atrium and His bundle region. Through another femoral vein, a 200 µm optical fiber was inserted {{by way of a}} 7 F catheter with a preformed curved tip. Guided by fluoroscopy and His bundle electrograms, the fiber's tip was positioned in the AV nodal region. After autonomic blockade was achieved with intravenous propranolol (5 mg) and atropine (1 mg), AV conduction was analyzed. An argon laser delivered 3 to 4 watts into the fiber in bursts of 10 seconds' duration until the desired degree of AV nodal delay or block (second or third degree) was manifested. Monitoring of His bundle electrograms was continued for 2 hours. Four weekly serial electrocardiograms were recorded, after which electrophysiologic studies were repeated. Acute post-lasing studies showed that: 1) in all six dogs, the mean PR interval was prolonged from 116 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 100 to 135) to 153 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 120 to 185), with the prolongation being caused exclusively by AH lengthening from 68 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 50 to 90) to 105 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 65 to 140); 2) the mean effective refractory period of the AV node increased from less than 185 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> < 150 to < 200) to 215 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 190 to 280); and 3) the mean atrial pacing cycle length, at which second degree AV nodal block was manifested, increased from 210 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 160 to 260) to 261 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 205 to 320). The PA, H and HV intervals and QRS complex remained constant. In two of the six dogs, additional radiation produced second and eventually third degree AH block with an escape junctional rhythm, HV interval and QRS complex identical to those during control normal sinus rhythm. After 2 hours, the junctional rhythm was replaced by a distal rhythm that persisted for the next 4 weeks. In the remaining four dogs, persistence of AV nodal delays was noted when the dogs were restudied at 4 weeks. None of the dogs exhibited any complications during the acute or chronic observations. The potential application of this technique to slow AV nodal conduction for management of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in human beings merits further clinical investigation...|$|R

40|$|Chronic neural {{recordings}} {{were taken}} from the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) of echolocating bats while they were engaged in one of two distinct behavioral tasks: virtual target amplitude discrimination (VTAD) and real oscillating target tracking (ROTT). In the VTAD task, bats used a limited range of sonar call features to discriminate the amplitude category of echoes, whereas in the ROTT task, the bat produced dynamically modulated sonar calls to track a moving target. Newly developed methods for chronic recordings in unrestrained, behaving bats reveal two consistent bouts of SC neural activity preceding the onset of sonar vocalizations in both tasks. A short lead bout occurs tightly coupled to vocal onset (VTAD, � 5. 1 to � 2. 2 <b>ms</b> <b>range,</b> � 3. 6 � 0. 7 ms mean lead time; ROTT, � 3. 0 to � 0. 4 <b>ms</b> <b>range,</b> � 1. 2 � 1. 3 ms mean lead time), and this activity {{may play a role in}} marking the time of each sonar emission. A long lead bout in SC activity occurs earlier and spreads over a longer interval (VTAD, � 40. 6 to � 8. 4 <b>ms</b> <b>range,</b> � 22. 2 � 3. 9 ms mean lead time; ROTT, � 29. 8 to � 7. 1 <b>ms</b> <b>range,</b> � 17. 5 � 9. 1 ms mean lead time) when compared with short lead events. In the goal-directed ROTT task, the timing of long lead event times vary with the bat’s sonar call duration. This finding, along with behavioral studies demonstrating that bats adjust sonar call duration as they track targets at changing distance, suggests the bat SC contributes to range-dependent adjustments of sonar call duration...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with atrial fibrillation (AF), the {{autonomic nervous system}} is supposed to play an role in triggering AF; however, little is known of the effect on atrial conduction characteristics. The {{purpose of this study}} was to study the effect of ganglionic plexus (GP) stimulation during sinus rhythm on atrial and pulmonary vein conduction in patients during thoracoscopic surgery for AF METHODS: In 25 patients, the anterior right ganglionic plexus (ARGP) was stimulated (16 Hz, at 1, 2, and 5 mA). Epicardial electrograms were recorded using a 48 -electrode map from the right pulmonary vein (RPV) or right atrial (RA). Intra-atrial activation time (IAT), local activation time (LAT), and inhomogeneity of conduction (IIC) were determined. ECG parameters (P-P, P-R interval) were measured. P-P interval was 956 ± 157 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 768 - 1368 ms), and P-R interval was 203 ± 37 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 136 - 280 ms). After ARGP stimulation, a short-lasting increase of P-P interval was observed, more prominent at higher output (1 mA = 82 ms, 2 mA = 180 ms, 5 mA = 268 ms, all P <. 01 vs baseline). P-R interval remained unchanged. IAT was 34. 4 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 5. 6 - 50. 3 ms) at the RA and 105. 8 <b>ms</b> (<b>range</b> 79. 7 - 163. 3 ms) at the RPV. After 1 -mA stimulation IAT increased, in patients taking beta-blockers (P =. 001), or it decreased, and this change persisted after subsequent stimulation at higher current (1 mA, P =. 001; 2 mA, P =. 401; 5 mA, P =. 593). Similar changes were observed for LAT and IIC. ARGP stimulation results in a short-lasting, output-dependent decrease in sinus node frequency due to a parasympathetic response. Stimulation of the ARGP induced a prolonged increase or decrease in conduction characteristics in {{patients with}} AF, consistent with a persistent differential parasympathetic and/or sympathetic respons...|$|R
