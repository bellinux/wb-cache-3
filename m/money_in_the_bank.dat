5|$|On July 18, at the <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> pay-per-view, The Miz won a <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> ladder {{match to}} win a {{contract}} for a WWE Championship match that he could utilize at any time {{over the next year}} and became the first performer to win <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> while being a champion and the second, after Rob Van Dam, to hold a <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> contract and a title at the same time. Over the next few weeks, The Miz attempted to cash in his <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> contract on the WWE Champion Sheamus, but was continually interrupted by other wrestlers before the matches could occur, which meant that he retained the contract for future use. Daniel Bryan returned to WWE at SummerSlam, taking The Miz's place on Team WWE, causing The Miz to attack him. This began a rivalry between the two, with The Miz losing the United States Championship to Bryan at the Night of Champions event in September. The following month, Miz defeated John Cena to become the captain of Team Raw, but at the Bragging Rights pay-per-view Team Raw—The Miz (with Alex Riley), R-Truth, John Morrison, Santino Marella, Sheamus, CM Punk, and Ezekiel Jackson—were unsuccessful in defeating Team SmackDown.|$|E

Kennedy announced on the April 30 episode of Raw that he would be cashing in his <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> championship opportunity at WrestleMania 24. On the May 7 episode of Raw, Kennedy, however, lost his <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> opportunity to Edge, losing mere moments after being struck with a monitor before the match began. Because of the injury Kennedy sustained during his match with Edge, it was revealed that his right triceps muscle tore off the bone and he would be out for a minimum of five to seven months. The injury, however, was not as serious, as the triceps tendon did not tear off the bone but was, in fact, a massive hematoma.|$|E

Two days later at the <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> pay-per-view, Ziggler won the <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> ladder match to guarantee him the opportunity to challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship at a time of his choosing within the next year. Later that night, Ziggler attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus after Alberto Del Rio attacked him after their match, but Del Rio stopped Ziggler from cashing in. On the following episode of SmackDown, Ziggler again attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus following a tag team match with Alberto Del Rio, but was laid out by Rey Mysterio and Sheamus before he could do so. During this time, Ziggler began a feud with Chris Jericho after claiming he had lost his touch, which resulted in Jericho attacking him on two occasions, and defeating him in a singles match at SummerSlam. The night after SummerSlam, Ziggler defeated Jericho in a rematch; as a result Ziggler retained his <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> contract and Jericho's WWE contract was terminated. Following this, Ziggler began feuding with Randy Orton on SmackDown four days later, after Orton hit him with an RKO when Ziggler tried to cash his <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> contract on a vulnerable Sheamus. The following week on SmackDown, Ziggler faced Orton in a match that was won by Orton, Ziggler defeated him in a rematch on Raw by pinning him while holding his tights.

Denver was already suffering economically due to several successive years of droughts and harsh winters that had hurt the agricultural industry.

With no federal insurance to support <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks,</b> many people lost their life savings. As Denver banks closed, real estate values dropped, smelters stopped working, and Denver Tramway had trouble getting people to ride and pay their fares.
