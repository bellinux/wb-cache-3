It had three main objectives: to be as basic and comprehensive as possible, to have an ability to model real situations and suiting, and hence to provide a tool for improvements in design. Basic thermo-fluids equations for multi-component and multi-phase flow have been developed within commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software to address the heat and mass (moisture) transfer processes. This is combined with a human <b>metabolic</b> <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> model to simulate working operations. Finally, a particular feature {{is the definition of}} the 3 -D human body/suit microclimate, via the use of an unsuited and suited mannequin.

40|$|Prolonged severe {{exercise}} {{stresses the}} cardiovascular {{system with the}} need to address the competing demands of blood flow to both the exercising muscles and the skin, while maintaining arterial blood pressure for adequate blood flow to the brain. With the imposition of an environmental heat load in addition to a high <b>metabolic</b> <b>heat</b> <b>load,</b> core temperature steadily increases along with a number of associated circulatory adjustments that inevitably signal an increasing strain on homeostatic control. Whether endurance performance under these conditions is limited by the rise in core temperature (critical core temperature hypothesis) or is limited by the inability to meet the competing demands for blood flow is debatable. The “critical core temperature ” hypothesis is centered on an elevated body temperature providing peripheral afferent feedback from temperature-sensitive sites to the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in reduced CNS drive to the exercising muscles. Alternatively, exercise endurance in the heat may be limited by the rise in heart rate (HR) toward maximum HR that accompanies the increase in core temperature. The rise in HR is thought to compensate for a decrease in stroke volume (SV) as central venous pressure declines due to increased skin blood flow. However, recent research suggests that the upward drift in HR is the primary event that causes a decline in SV. Thus, the circulatory strain associated with HR approaching maximum and an inability to maintain cardiac output may signal fatigue in prolonged exercise in the heat...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the need}} for human beings to adapt their heat budget to the thermal {{environment}} in order to optimise comfort, performance and health the adaptation issue is a question of vital importance. Balancing the human heat budget, i. e. equilibration of the organism to variable environmental (atmospheric) and <b>metabolic</b> <b>heat</b> <b>loads</b> is controlled by a very efficient (for healthy people) autonomous thermoregulatory system that is additionally supported by behavioural adaptation which are driven by conscious sensations of thermal discomfort. These capabilities enable the (healthy) human being to live and to work in virtually any climate zone on earth, albeit with varying degrees of discomfort. Based on mortality studies a large number of publications show the evidence of adverse health impacts by thermal stresses, in particular during heat waves. Based on thermo physiology and heat exchange theory an overview is given on different assessment approaches up {{to the development of the}} ⿿Universal Thermal Climate Index⿝ within ISB Commission 6 and the European COST Action 730.

40|$|High ambient {{temperatures}} {{have severe}} {{adverse effects on}} biological functions of high-yielding dairy cows. The metabolic adaption to heat stress was examined in 14 German Holsteins transition cows assigned to two groups, one heat-stressed (HS) and one pair-fed (PF) {{at the level of}} HS. After 6 days of thermoneutrality and ad libitum feeding (P 1), cows were challenged for 6 days (P 2) by heat stress (temperature humidity index (THI) = 76) or thermoneutral pair-feeding in climatic chambers 3 weeks ante partum and again 3 weeks post-partum. On the sixth day of each period P 1 or P 2, oxidative metabolism was analyzed for 24 hours in open circuit respiration chambers. Water and feed intake, vital parameters and milk yield were recorded. Daily blood samples were analyzed for glucose, β-hydroxybutyric acid, non-esterified fatty acids, urea, creatinine, methyl histidine, adrenaline and noradrenaline. In general, heat stress caused marked effects on water homeorhesis with impairments of renal function and a strong adrenergic response accompanied with a prevalence of carbohydrate oxidation over fat catabolism. Heat-stressed cows extensively degraded tissue protein as reflected by the increase of plasma urea, creatinine and methyl histidine concentrations. However, the acute metabolic heat stress response in dry cows differed from early-lactating cows as the prepartal adipose tissue was not refractory to lipolytic, adrenergic stimuli, and the rate of amino acid oxidation was lower than in the postpartal stage. Together with the lower endogenous <b>metabolic</b> <b>heat</b> <b>load,</b> metabolic adaption in dry cows is indicative for a higher heat tolerance and the prioritization of the nutritional requirements of the fast-growing near-term fetus.
