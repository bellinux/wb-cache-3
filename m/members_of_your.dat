These are a chain of convictions against Yulia Tymoshenko following one after another until some of them might “shoot”… I’m applying to my colleagues from the Ukrainian government who are present in here. When you are back home and report before the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> office, tell them {{to put an end to}} these. These are shameful!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Wheelock {{presented}} {{the president with}} the Society's petition asking for appointment of a three-member commission to gain US citizenship for American Indians, and for broadening jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Claims {{so that it could}} hear all Indian nation claims against the United States. He said to Wilson, [...] "We believe that you feel, with the progressive <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> race, that it is anomalous permanently to conserve within the nation groups of people whose civic condition by legislation is different from the normal standard of American life." [...] The outbreak of World War I impeded federal enactment of remedial Indian legislation.|$|E

60|$|SIR HOWARD. I {{have already}} met the only <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> escort {{who might have}} borne a grudge against me, Captain; and he was acquitted.|$|R
2500|$|In July 2013, {{the county}} {{prosecutor}} {{released a report}} that [...] "revealed {{an extraordinary amount of}} sexual conduct that was committed both on-duty and off-duty" [...] with a single woman. As a result of the report, an assistant chief of the department retired while five officers were placed on various forms of modified duty. [...] "Had these <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> department been more focused on the important responsibilities of law enforcement, rather than pursuing sexual encounters with a civilian analyst, LPD might not be in the condition it is today", the report concluded. Sergeants Rusty Longaberger and David Woolverton were fired for conduct unbecoming, failure to report misconduct, and neglect of duty.|$|E
2500|$|As Wright philosophized of {{this period}} some thirty years later, 'Having a witness among the poor and having a {{ministry}} to the poor is one thing, but making the poor folks <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> congregation is something else altogether." [...] Wright further explained, [...] "Failure to have the black poor {{at the table with}} you as equals means you are doing missionary work," [...] while having [...] "poor black folks" [...] who [...] "sit down at the table as equals" [...] means you are [...] "serious about talking or doing [...] black theology." [...] As Speller explains, Trinity's congregants [...] "began to slowly move away from the concept of church as a place to enhance and validate their social position to one that appreciated the church as a place for spiritual formation." [...] In sum, Trinity began to more fully move away from its earlier purpose surrounding [...] "middle-classness" [...] to one where devotion to God and the poor took much greater prominence.|$|E
6000|$|The {{head clerk}} {{took up the}} first letter of the two {{and pointed to the}} opening sentence: [...] "Sir Giles Mountjoy, I have a {{disclosure}} to make in which one of the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family is seriously interested." [...] Dennis emphatically repeated the words: [...] "one of the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family." [...] His employer regarded him with a broad stare of astonishment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{why do you}} not invite your nephew, Captain M'Intyre, who is {{mentioned}} by every one as a fine spirited young fellow, to become a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew it all before, I {{believed}} it all before," [...] {{he said at}} length, [...] "but I would not accept your baptism and become a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> Church." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the website}} www.belgium.be states {{that you may}} as well live in {{cohabitation}} with a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family or any other person with whom you have a relationship without sexual connotation.|$|R

50|$|Courier work {{is among}} those things that consist of hours of boredom punctuated with moments of sheer terror. Keeping a courier, {{who is not a}} <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> service and/or has {{diplomatic}} cover, is challenging.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you are {{perfectly}} sure," [...] said Mr. Delaplaine, [...] "that you can restrain your men from violence, I {{would like to}} be a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> boarding party; it would be a rare experience for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And by {{that you}} {{imply that the}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> congregation, {{those who have been}} brought up and baptized and {{confirmed}} in this church, are not Christians?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It IS easy," [...] {{declared}} the monarch, [...] "if {{one is a}} good guesser. But {{it appears that the}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> party are all poor guessers." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Penniman {{hesitated a}} moment. Then she risked her retort. [...] "Your being a {{distinguished}} physician has not prevented you from already losing TWO <b>MEMBERS</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it, exactly," [...] {{asserted}} Beth. [...] "It's like {{hearing a}} tale of an ancestor, Thursday, or <b>of</b> some <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family who lived before you. You cannot be responsible, in any way, for another man's wickedness." ...|$|R
50|$|Begging in Denmark {{is illegal}} under section 197 of the penal code. Begging or letting a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> {{household}} under 18 beg is illegal after being warned {{by the police}} and is punishable by 6 months in jail.|$|R
60|$|BROADBENT. Surely {{the text}} refers to our {{right and left}} hands. I am {{somewhat}} surprised to hear a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> Church quote so essentially Protestant a document as the Bible; {{but at least you}} might quote it accurately.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{do not ask}} {{after the}} regular <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> household, but after {{those who have been}} within your gates, either as guests, or as {{malignant}} fugitives taking shelter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{ideas of}} {{commercial}} ethics, Marquis," [...] he acknowledged, [...] "are excellent in their way, {{but do you}} imagine {{that they will be}} shared by the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family who have parted with their money?" ...|$|E
60|$|WAITER. Well, if {{you will}} excuse my {{mentioning}} it, ma'am, I think Mr. McComas feels {{that he would get}} fairer play if he could speak to you away from the younger <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family, ma'am.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If so, my dear,' {{observed}} Mr. Micawber, {{with his}} usual suddenness of warmth on that subject, 'as the <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family--whoever he, she, or it, may be--has kept us waiting for a considerable period, perhaps the Member may now wait MY convenience.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are wiser {{not to ask}} that" [...] she said. [...] "It is one {{of those}} cases where {{knowledge}} means death. But I can at least give you a hint. Have you any influence at all with any <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> government?" ...|$|R

60|$|THAT in the {{execution}} of his evil design, the said Quiz, or author of the said work, must have betrayed some trust or confidence reposed in him by some <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> Honourable sex, otherwise he never could have acquired so much information relative to the manners and customs of your Honourable sex in general.|$|E

40|$|This case {{is about}} an animal that is facing extinction. A {{previously}} unknown disease, which {{looks a lot like}} cancer, is decimating the population. This is alarming for many reasons, but understanding its cause also offers hope for conservation. Before you attempt this case study of the plight of an endangered species, you must do some research. You will work in teams of four. There are four research topics below. You should assign one topic to each <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> team. Your goal is to research your assigned topic and answer the questions. You might wish to use the suggested references to guide your research. Each student’s research will be written up and shared among the other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the team. You should therefore bring printed Research Reports for each <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> team next time you meet (next class) ...|$|R
