50|$|New Zealand had 6,735 {{registered}} beekeepers in June 2016, {{who owned}} more than 600,000 hives in over 42,000 apiaries. In 2015/16 total honey production was 19.8 thousand tonnes. The production of manuka honey, valued for its antibacterial properties, is increasingly important. Pollen, beeswax, and propolis are also produced and exported. Beekeepers provide pollination services to horticulturists, {{which used to}} generate more income than the products of <b>bee</b> <b>culture.</b> However, rising honey prices have pushed pollination fees to keep up.Approximately 42 thousand live queen bees, and 38 tonnes of packaged bees (which include approximately one kilogram of worker bees to support the queen) are exported live each year.|$|R
5000|$|Writing part memoir, part <b>bee</b> <b>culture,</b> Miller {{began his}} {{personal}} {{account of the}} honey business in 1886 with A Year Among the Bees, in which he announced he had [...] "made the production of honey his exclusive business" [...] for eight years. This was expanded into Forty Years Among the Bees (1903, 2nd ed. 1906), then into his classic, Fifty Years Among the Bees (1911), culminating with A Thousand Answers to Beekeeping Questions (1917). Miller also edited the American Bee Journal and produced a popular monthly advice column answering reader's questions.

50|$|A bee bole is {{a cavity}} or alcove {{in a wall}} (the Scots word bole means a recess in a wall). A skep {{is placed in the}} bee bole. Before the {{development}} of <b>modern</b> <b>bee</b> hives (such as the design published by Lorenzo Langstroth in 1853), the use of bee boles was a practical way of keeping bees in some parts of Britain, although most beekeepers kept their skeps in the open covered by items suitable for the purpose, such as old pots or sacking. The bee bole helped to keep the wind and rain away from the skep and the bees living inside. Bee keeping was a very common activity in the past before sugar became plentiful and affordable as a sweetener. Demand was also a high for beeswax for candles, especially from the prereformation churches, cathedrals, and abbeys; tithes and rents were often paid in honey and/or beeswax, or even bee swarms.|$|R
5000|$|His {{success in}} {{capitalizing on the}} vast honey {{potential}} of San Diego County, along with his extensive campaign of selling bees to {{the residents of the}} county was the major force in making San Diego County the greatest honey producing county in the State of California by 1874, which in turn made California the leading honey producing state of the Union. John Harbison was a major contributor to the theory of <b>bee</b> <b>culture</b> with his development of new tools and methods that characterized the remarkable advances made in nineteenth century apicultural science. Harbison and his brother William were both important 19th century American authors on bee keeping science. [...] Furthermore, he opened up the great retail markets east of the Mississippi River needed to absorb the tremendous honey crops produced in California. Harbison, known as the [...] "King of the Beekeepers" [...] died on October 12, 1912, in San Diego at the age of eighty-six.|$|R
2500|$|The close {{relatives}} of <b>modern</b> honey <b>bees</b> [...] e.g. bumblebees and stingless bees [...] are also social to some degree, and social behavior seems a plesiomorphic trait that predates {{the origin of}} the genus. Among the extant members of Apis, the more basal species make single, exposed combs, while the more recently evolved species nest in cavities and have multiple combs, which has greatly facilitated their domestication.|$|R
50|$|Abu Shadi {{lived in}} England from 1912 to 1922. He studied {{medicine}} at the University of London and graduated with distinction in 1917. In 1919 he founded the Apis Club, an international organization of individual beekeepers and bee scientists in different countries, based at Port Hill House in Benson, Oxfordshire. Abushady launched and edited the Apis Club periodical Bee World, 'an international monthly journal devoted to the progressive interests of <b>modern</b> <b>bee</b> culture', which was later edited by Annie D. Betts (1929-1949) and by Dr. Eva Crane (1950-1983). The Apis Club organized various international conferences in Europe, and the scientific content of the contributions and publications increased; these and {{the activities of the}} Apis Club were reported in Bee World. The Apis Club was eventually transitioned to the International Bee Research Association (IBRA). Its archives are currently held in the National Library of Wales. In 1919, Abushady filed his first patent in Great Britain for a removable, standardized aluminum honeycomb; he filed four patents in total for improvements made to beekeeping apparatuses.|$|R
5000|$|Altamont {{hands him}} the package. Von Bork finds {{that it is a}} book titled Practical Handbook of <b>Bee</b> <b>Culture,</b> hardly what he {{expected}}. Even less expected is the chloroform-soaked rag that is held in his face by Altamont a moment later. Altamont is actually Sherlock Holmes in disguise, and the chauffeur who brought him is Dr. Watson. Now past their heyday, they have nonetheless caught several spies (Holmes is actually responsible for the imprisoned agents of whom [...] "Altamont" [...] spoke), and fed the Germans some thoroughly untrustworthy intelligence. Holmes has been on this case for two years, and it has taken him to Chicago, Buffalo, and Ireland, where he learnt to play the part of a bitter Irish-American, even gaining the credentials of a member of a secret society. He identified the security leak through which British secrets were reaching the Germans, and then set out to apprehend the receiving agents themselves. The housekeeper was one of Holmes' agents: the light that she switched off was the signal to Holmes and Watson that the coast was clear.|$|R

To facilitate studies of this important biological model, the genomic sequence of the western honey bee, Apis mellifera, was published in 2006, providing a wealth of information for understanding the molecular basis of social behavior and eusocial evo-lution [5]. Honey bees are classified in the order Hymenoptera, which also includes ants, bees, sawflies, and wasps [6]. The genus Apis consists of eight Asian species and one western species [7]. Ancient bees first emerged 120 – 130 million years ago (mya) coincident with the emergence of early angiosperms [8]. The ancestors of <b>modern</b> <b>bees</b> were geographically isolated in the Middle East during the late Pleistocene approximately 1 – 2 mya.

The study was carried out by collecting data from primary and secondary sources. The result of study from sample respondent showed that majority of the hive owned by the bee keepers was traditional next to this transition and lastly <b>modern</b> <b>bee</b> hive. The annual average income earned by sample respondents was 1358 birr. When I compare producers selling price during harvest with the selling price of intermediaries after harvest has shown significant difference. The result indicated that bee keepers were receiving less income where as the intermediaries are benefiting better earning. This shows as there is marketing in efficiency in the study area. In the study area the level of honey channel, the constraints and opportunities of honey market have been identified. The level of honey market was indicated by its low level of honey extraction and processing, storage and transportation materials, means of transportation of honey to the market, flow of market information, honey transaction measurements etc are identified...|$|R
60|$|When the {{earliest}} reasoners, {{in an age}} and in mental conditions of which we know nothing historically, had evolved the hypothesis of this conscious, powerful, separable soul, capable of surviving {{the death of the}} body, it was not difficult for them to develop the rest of Religion, as Mr. Tylor thinks. A powerful ghost of a dead man might thrive till, its original owner being long forgotten, it became a God. Again (souls once given) {{it would not be a}} very difficult logical leap, perhaps, to conceive of souls, or spirits, that had never been human at all. It is, we may say, only le premier pas qui coûte, the step to the belief in a surviving separable soul. Nevertheless, when we remember that Mr. Tylor is theorising about savages in the dim background of human evolution, savages whom we know nothing of by experience, savages far behind Australians and Bushmen (who possess Gods), we must admit that he credits them with great ingenuity, and strong powers of abstract reasoning. He may be right in his opinion. In the same way, just as primitive men were keen reasoners, so early bees, more clever than <b>modern</b> <b>bees,</b> may have evolved the system of hexagonal cells, and only an early fish of genius could first have hit on the plan, now hereditary of killing a fly by blowing water at it.|$|R
40|$|Stark {{contrasts}} in clade {{species diversity}} are reported across {{the tree of}} life and are especially conspicuous when observed in closely related lineages. The explanation for such disparity has often been attributed to the evolution of key innovations that facilitate colonization of new ecological niches. The factors underlying diversification in bees remain poorly explored. Bees are thought to have originated from apoid wasps during the Mid-Cretaceous, a period that coincides with the appearance of angiosperm eudicot pollen grains in the fossil record. The reliance of bees on angiosperm pollen and their fundamental role as angiosperm pollinators have contributed to the idea that both groups may have undergone simultaneous radiations. We demonstrate that one key innovation—the inclusion of foreign material in nest construction—underlies both a massive range expansion and {{a significant increase in the}} rate of diversification within the second largest bee family, Megachilidae. Basal clades within the family are restricted to deserts and exhibit plesiomorphic features rarely observed among <b>modern</b> <b>bees,</b> but prevalent among apoid wasps. Our results suggest that early bees inherited a suite of behavioural traits that acted as powerful evolutionary constraints. While the transition to pollen as a larval food source opened an enormous ecological niche for the early bees, the exploitation of this niche and the subsequent diversification of bees only became possible after bees had evolved adaptations to overcome these constraints...|$|R
