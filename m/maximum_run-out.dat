Once movement of a rock perched {{on the top of}} a slope (bench) has been initiated, the most important factor controlling its fall trajectory is the geometry of the slope (bench). The best possible knowledge of rockfall trajectories and energies is important in order to determine accurate risk zoning and for the design and construction of adequate defence systems near the threatened areas. This study attempts to determine the influence of bench geometries, and the coefficient of restitution of rock, on rockfall behaviour. A study of literature was carried out to review previous studies and other relevant information on rockfalls and their analysis. The literature may be divided into two categories: experimental methods involving physical modelling, and computer models involving rockfall analyses using computers analysis methods. Rockfall computer simulation is considered to be applicable, quick to carry out and reproducible. The accuracy of the results depends on the knowledge of site conditions and slope geometry. The use of the Modified Ritchie criterion for the design of catch benches in open pit mines was also investigated. The assessment of bounce height, <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> distance and kinetic energy achieved during the fall of rocks on the catch bench were the bases of the evaluation of the results obtained in this project. The computer program, Rocfall Version 4, was used for the purposes of the research. The following parameter variables were considered in the analyses: three types of rock; slopes with three stack configurations; four bench heights; and four bench face angles. The results show that, for all stack configurations and rock types, the maximum runout distance and maximum bounce height increase as functions of bench height at a specific bench face angle. A single bench configuration provides a <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> distance of falling rocks larger than the value determined using the Modified Ritchie criterion for all rock types and bench face angles. Multiple bench stack configurations provide <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> distances less than the value determined using the Modified Ritchie criterion only for the 90 o bench face angle in all rock types; those with 60 o, 70 o and 80 o bench face angle provide a larger <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> distance. Therefore, the validity of the Modified Ritchie criterion for the design of catch bench widths in open pit mines with inclined benches must be questioned. According to Ritchieâ€™s study (1963), rocks that fall in trajectory (free fall) seldom give high bounces after impact on a catch bench. This project shows that this finding is valid for rocks with low coefficients of normal restitution. Rocks with lower coefficients of normal restitution provide larger run-out distances with flatter bench face angles compared with rocks with higher coefficients. In contrast, rocks with higher coefficients provide larger run-out distances than those with lower coefficients for steeper angles. The consideration of the influence of geometry (shape) of falling rocks on rockfall behaviour showed that, for a flatter slope, as could logically be expected, the <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> distance is greatest for rounder rocks and smallest for flatter slabby iv rocks. This is due to the fact that on a flatter slope, the mode of falling of rounder rocks is rolling down the slope. This mode provides essentially no resistance to motion, resulting in largest <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> distance. In contrast, for long flat slabs, the mode of movement will be sliding, which results in a smaller <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> distance. The <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> distance as function of rock shape reduces as the normal coefficient of restitution increases. For all rock types, the maximum bounce height reduces as a function of the friction angle for flatter slopes. This is due to the fact that rocks are in contact with the slope during the rockfall. As the coefficient of normal restitution increases, an increase in the maximum bounce height results...|$|E

30|$|One of {{the most}} recent efforts to embark upon a {{delineation}} of debris flows susceptibility maps in two dimensions for a medium scale is the software Flow-R (van Westen et al. 2010) developed by Horton et al. (2013) at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. This software uses a GIS-based approach that couples an automatic detection of the source areas and a simple assessment of the debris flow spreading (Kappes et al. 2011). Flow-R attempts to give an insight of existing or potential new susceptibility zones without any notion of intensity or occurrence probability in a regionally scale with limited data. Horton et al. (2013) applied the model Flow-R using a digital elevation model for the Canton de Vaud territory (Switzerland), a lithological map and a land use map to identify the potential source areas. The spreading and run-out estimates were based on basic probabilistic and energy calculations that allow them to define the maximal run-out distance of a debris flow. Blahut et al. (2010 a) used also Flow-R for a debris flow hazard assessment at medium scale in Valtellina di Tirano, Italy. <b>Maximum</b> probable <b>run-out</b> zones were calibrated using documented past events and aerial photographs. As a result, they proposed two debris flow hazard maps: the first map delimits five hazard zones, while the second one incorporates the information about debris flow direction probabilities, showing areas more likely to be affected by future debris flows. Kappes et al. (2011) applied the Flow-R model to the Barcelonnette Basin in France using the model for source areas identification and the empirical angle of reach concept to define a worst-case scenario in the area. They also generated scenarios for high, medium and low frequency events, based on a varying angle of reach. The results were compared with the footprints of a few mapped events, showing a high dependency {{on the quality of the}} digital elevation model. Ma (2011) applied a method for multi-hazard mass movement susceptibility assessment with run-out, using Flow-R, in a mountainous area with limited information on past events at a regional scale in Mtsekheta-Mtianeti, Georgia. Maps with cells containing significant values of susceptibility for initiation areas were created using SMCE (Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation). These cells were used as initiation points and the run-out assessment was performed with the Flow-R model. Based on the level of susceptibility, three different triggering scenarios were produced heuristically.|$|R
40|$|Volcanoes are dynamic {{evolving}} structures, {{with life}} cycles that are punctuated by episodes of flank instability. Putauaki (Mount Edgecumbe) is a stratovolcano located onshore in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the stability of Putauaki and analyse the risk associated with volcanic collapse. To achieve this objective, a multidisciplinary approach was used, incorporating geomorphological and geological mapping, rock mass classification, laboratory testing to identify geotechnical properties of materials representative of the volcano, stability modelling, and analysis of landslide run-out zones. Putauaki comprises two predominant features including the larger and younger Main Cone (the summit lying 820 m a. s. l., slope angles up to 36), and smaller and older Main Dome (the summit lying 420 m a. s. l., slope angle of 24). Both features show little evidence of erosion or surface water. Rock mass description defined six lithotechnical units including indurated andesite, indurated dacite, scoriaceous andesite, altered andesite (all categorised as hard rocks), and block and ash flow and Matahina Ignimbrite (both categorised as soft rocks). The uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of indurated andesite and indurated dacite was 60 4 MPa and 44. 7 0. 9 MPa respectively, correlating with moderately strong rock. Discontinuities of the indurated units were widely spaced, showed medium persistence and wide aperture, and were slightly weathered. Infill comprised predominantly loosely packed, very strong, coarse gravel. UCS of scoriaceous andesite and altered andesite was 25 5 MPa and 15 1 MPa respectively, allowing categorisation as very weak rock. Discontinuities of scoriaceous andesite were widely spaced, showed high persistence and wide aperture, and were moderately weathered. Discontinuities of the altered andesite were moderately spaced, showed low persistence and wide aperture, and were highly weathered. Infill of scoriaceous and altered andesite was loosely packed, moist, weak to very weak medium gravel. The block and ash flow was a poorly sorted, loosely packed, sandy, gravely and cobble rich matrix supported deposit. The Matahina Ignimbrite was a very weak, discontinuity-poor deposit. Shear box testing indicated cohesion and friction angle of 0 MPa and 42. 1 (block and ash flow) and 1. 4 x 10 - 3 MPa and 41. 7 (Matahina Ignimbrite) respectively. These values are similar to published values. Correlation of each lithotechnical unit to its respective rock mass description site allowed approximate boundaries of each unit to be mapped. Each unit's mass strength was combined with measured bulk densities and incorporated into two dimensional slope profiles using the stability modelling package GalenaTM. Ten slope profiles of Putauaki were constructed. Failure surfaces for each slope profile were defined using the Bishop simplified multiple analysis method. Four slope profiles showed the potential for small scale failure (less than 0. 1 km 2 of material). The remaining six slope profiles showed the potential for large scale failure (greater than 0. 1 km 2 of material). Stability of these six slope profiles was investigated further in relation to earthquake force, watertable elevation, and a disturbance factor of the rock mass (D). Conditions of failure graphs for profile 6 a showed that at low D (less than 0. 4), earthquake forces and watertable elevation must be unrealistically high for the region (greater than 0. 33 g; greater than 15 % watertable elevation) in order produce a factor of safety less than 1. The remaining five slope profiles showed potential to be unstable under realistic earthquake forces and watertable elevations. Two of these profiles were unable to achieve stability at D greater than 0. 8 (profile 4) and D greater than 0. 9 (profile 5). A D value of 0. 6 (intermediate between 0. 4 and 0. 8) is argued to most realistically represent Putauaki. The fact that Putauaki has not undergone large scale failure to date supports the conclusion that the constructed models overestimate the influence of those factors which promote slope instability. Maximum and minimum landslide run-out zones were constructed for the slope profiles exhibiting the potential for large scale failure. Definition of the position and extent of <b>maximum</b> and minimum <b>run-out</b> zones assumed H/L (fall height to run-out length) ratios of 0. 09 and 0. 18 respectively, as well as the 'credible flow path' concept. Identified impacts of landslides sourced from Putauaki include inundation of Kawerau Township, Tarawera River, forestry operations, road networks, and power supplies. Based on these impacts, the risk posed by landslides from each slope profile was categorised as ranging from relatively low to relatively high. Landslides sourced from the south-west flanks pose a relatively low risk due to their prerequisite of unrealistically high watertable elevations and earthquake forces. Landslides sourced from the north-west flanks pose a relatively high risk as minimum run-out will inundate north-east parts of Kawerau Township. Landslides sourced from the eastern flanks pose a moderate risk due to their run-out zones avoiding Kawerau Township...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the debris}} flow events that {{occurred}} in May 1998 {{in the area of}} Sarno, Southern Italy, this paper presents an approach to simulate debris flow <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out.</b> On the basis of the flow source areas and an average thickness of 1 · 2 m of the scarps, we estimated debris flow volumes of the order of 104 and 105 m 3. Flow mobility ratios (ΔH/L) derived from the x, y, z coordinates of the lower-most limit of the source areas (i. e. apex of the alluvial fan) and the distal limit of the flows ranged between 0 · 27 and 0 · 09. We performed regression analyses that showed a good correlation between the estimated flow volumes and mobility ratios. This paper presents a methodology for predicting <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> of future debris flow events, based on the developed empirical relationship. We implemented the equation that resulted from the calibration as a set of GIS macros written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and running within ArcGIS. We carried out sensitivity analyses and observed that hazard mapping with this methodology should attempt to delineate hazard zones with a minimum horizontal resolution of 0 · 4 km. The developed procedure enables the rapid delineation of debris flow maximum extent within reasonable levels of uncertainty, it incorporates sensitivities and it facilitates hazard assessments via graphic user interfaces and with modest computing resource...|$|E
30|$|Landslides hazard {{analyses}} entail a scale-dependent {{approach in}} order to mitigate accordingly the damages and other negative consequences at the respective scales of occurrence. Medium or large scale landslide run-out modelling for many possible landslide initiation areas {{has been a very}} difficult task in the past. This arises from the inability of the run-out models to compute the displacement with a large amount of individual initiation areas as {{it turns out to be}} computationally strenuous. Most of the existing physically based run-out models have difficulties in handling such situations. For this reason, empirical methods have been used as a practical mean to predict landslides mobility at a medium scale (1 : 10, 000 to 1 : 50, 000). They are the most widely used techniques to estimate the <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> distance and affected zones not only locally but also regionally.

40|$|Rockfall {{propagation}} {{areas can}} be determined using a simple geometric rule known as shadow angle or energy line method based on a simple Coulomb frictional model implemented in the CONEFALL computer program. Runout zones are estimated from a digital terrain model (DTM) and a grid file containing the cells representing rockfall potential source areas. The cells of the DTM that are lowest in altitude and located within a cone centered on a rockfall source cell belong to the potential propagation area associated with that grid cell. In addition, the CONEFALL method allows estimation of mean and maximum velocities and energies of blocks in the rockfall propagation areas. Previous studies indicate that the slope angle cone ranges from 27 ° to 37 ° depending on the assumptions made, i. e. slope morphology, probability of reaching a point, <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out,</b> field observations.

In this paper, a case study is conducted in the Özlüce Forest District of İnebolu, Turkey. Potential rockfall source areas are firstly calculated and mapped via RollFree, which uses a digital elevation model as the only input. The rockfall travel distance is then identified using an empirical energy line angle to create propagation maps for different scenarios (using a set of four angles: 28 °, 32 °, 35 °, and 38 °). By marking the lower boundaries of propagation, the <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> zone of a fallen block is determined as having a very low, low, medium, or high probability of occurrence (marking the lower boundaries of propagation). These propagation maps are then overlapped with a forest stand map to define areas where the forest provides a protective function against rockfall.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} depth-integrated {{theory is}} derived for the gravity-driven free surface flow of cohesionless granular avalanches over complex shallow basal topography. This {{is an important}} extension of the one-dimensional Savage–Hutter theory. A simple curvilinear coordinate system is adopted, which is fitted to the ‘mean’ downslope chute topography. This defines a quasi-two-dimensional reference surface on top of which shallow three-dimensional basal topography is superposed. The governing equations are expressed in the curvilinear coordinate system and the massand momentum-balance equations are integrated through the avalanche depth. An ordering argument and a Mohr–Coulomb closure model are used to obtain a simple reduced system of equations. Laboratory experiments have been performed on a partly confined chute to validate the theory. An avalanche is released on a section inclined at 40 ◦ to the horizontal, on {{which there is a}} concave parabolic cross-slope profile, and runs out through a smooth transition zone onto a horizontal plane. A comparison of the experiment with numerical solutions shows that the avalanche tail speed is under-predicted. A modification to the bed-friction angle is proposed, which brings theory and experiment into very good agreement. The partly confined chute channels the flow and results in significantly longer <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> distances than on an unconfined chute.

Our recent research on 2 D granular column collapses by using 2 D granular materials (i. e., aluminum rods) has revealed results that differ markedly from those reported in the literature. We assume a 2 D column with an initial height of h 0 and initial width of d 0, a defined as their ratio (a =h 0 /d 0), a final height of h, and <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> distance of d. The experimental data suggest that for the low a regime (a 0. 65), the ratio of a to (d-d 0) /d 0, h 0 /h, or d/d 0 is expressed by power-law relations. In particular, the following power-function ratios (h 0 /h= 1. 42 a^ 2 / 3 and d/d 0 = 4. 30 a^ 0. 72) are proposed for every a > 0. 65. In contrast, the ratio (d-d 0) /d 0 = 3. 25 a^ 0. 96 only holds for 0. 65 < a 1. 5.

40|$|Spaceborne {{remote sensing}} {{techniques}} and numerical simulations have been combined in a web-GIS framework (LAV@HAZARD) to evaluate lava flow hazard in real time. By using the HOTSAT satellite thermal monitoring system to estimate time-varying TADR (time averaged discharge rate) and the MAGFLOW physicsbased model to simulate lava flow paths, the LAV@HAZARD platform allows timely definition of parameters and maps essential for hazard assessment, including the propagation time of lava flows and the <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> distance. We used LAV@HAZARD during the 2008 – 2009 lava flow-forming eruption at Mt Etna (Sicily, Italy). We measured the temporal variation in thermal emission (up {{to four times}} per hour) during the entire duration of the eruption using SEVIRI and MODIS data. The time-series of radiative power allowed us to identify six diverse thermal phases each related to different dynamic volcanic processes and associated with different TADRs and lava flow emplacement conditions. Satellite-derived estimates of lava discharge rates were computed and integrated for the whole period of the eruption (almost 14 months), showing that a lava volume of between 32 and 61 million cubic meters was erupted of which about 2 / 3 was emplaced during the first 4 months. These time-varying discharge rates were then used to drive MAGFLOW simulations to chart the spread of lava {{as a function of}} time. TADRs were sufficiently low (b 30 m 3 /s) that no lava flows were capable of flowing any great distance so that they did not pose a hazard to vulnerable (agricultural and urban) areas on the flanks of Etna...|$|E
30|$|In the past, several {{efforts to}} model rapid mass {{movements}} and debris flows in mountainous environment at medium scale {{has been carried}} out successfully despite the differences between the approaches used. Miller and Burnett (2008) analyzed the regional susceptibility of debris flow using low resolution digital elevation model and land-cover data (10 -m DEMs and 25 -m satellite imagery) and an empirical model to determine flow paths. They calculated empirical probabilities for debris-flow run-out over DEM-determined flow paths and show how these probabilities can be combined over all sources to estimate the potential for debris-flow delivery to stream reaches throughout entire channel networks. The model was calibrated and model predictions were compared to field-mapped debris-flow travel paths from study sites in the Coast Range of Oregon, USA. Their model predicts debris-flow probability over channel-reach scales that can be aggregated to basin-scale measures of debris-flow potential. Strîmbu (2011) presented a travel distance model for debris flows based on information collected in southeast British Columbia, Canada. The model incorporates a variable that represents terrain morphology by a single number. The terrain morphology was defined by a site-specific character, providing a process-based representation of local conditions. A multiple regression analysis was used to assess the dependency of even travel distance on terrain morphology, slope, stand height, terrain curvature and canopy closure. Following a similar approach, Tang et al. (2011) proposed an empirical regression model for preliminary estimates of the <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> length and lateral width of debris flow on fans for the Wenchuan earthquake-affected region (12 May 2008). From a rainfall triggering event on September 24 th of 2008, 46 debris-flow catchments with well-defined debris-flow deposits on alluvial fans were selected for the analysis. To determine the variables needed for the prediction of debris flow run-out characteristics on alluvial fans, a multiple regression analysis was used to establish a statistical model for the prediction of the characteristics of debris-flow run-out zones. Their model was able to estimate debris-flow run-out zones from easily measurable topographic parameters and the availability of loose sediments in the drainage basin. From the terrain parameters used for the prediction of the characteristics of debris flow run-out zones, the volume of removable sediment was the most important factor for establishing an applicable prediction model. Conway et al. (2010) used iso-maps and associated field observations, to find a relationship between ground slope and patterns in deposition volume in the Westfjords of Iceland. They used their finding as a basis for an empirical model that enables to make an estimate of the total travel distance and final thickness of future debris flows. Toyos et al. (2008), based on the debris flow events that occurred in May 1998 in the area of Sarno, Southern Italy, presented an approach to simulate debris flow <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out.</b> Flow mobility ratios (H/L) were derived from the x, y, z coordinates of the lower-most limit of the source areas (i.e., apex of the alluvial fan) and the distal limit of the flows. They performed a regression analysis that showed a correlation between the estimated flow volumes and mobility ratios. In another important effort, Rickenmann (1999 and 2005) developed a set of empirical relationships to be used to estimate the most important parameters of debris-flow behaviour. Based on these relationships, assessment of a maximum volume can be followed by estimates of the peak discharge and the run-out distance. As mentioned before, for its simplicity, statistical and empirical models are often the preferred and a well-established approach when trying to assess the hazard at a medium scale (e.g., Liu et al. 2002; Castellanos 2008).|$|E
30|$|Past efforts {{working at}} {{regional}} scales has {{taken into account}} the flow behavior, the flow resistance and the possibility to entrain material during its course by analyzing each individual event (and its behavioral characteristics) and then imposing those characteristics for a whole region. This task can become very cumbersome for a very large area or for a single triggering event that has caused many flow events in a same area. To name some examples of this methodology, Revellino et al. (2004) used the one dimensional DAN model (Hungr 1995) to simulate the velocity and duration of debris avalanches {{and the distribution of}} the deposits in the areas of Sarno/Quindici and Cervinara, (Italy). Using a large amount of available data (i.e., material properties and geomorphological settings), 17 cases were selected. Individual back-analysis of each case was carried out using a trial-and-error procedure and a combination of rheological parameters was found, that provided the best correspondence for each individual event in terms of run-out distance, velocity and distribution of deposits. The majority of the cases at the two sites were simulated with only one specific pair of rheological parameters (Voellmy rheology). Based on their successful simulation with closely constrained selection of input parameters, they propose to use the model to produce quite realistic first-order predictions of run-out of potential slides and to outline potential hazard areas. Another example of using physical models at medium scale is depicted by Hürlimann et al. (2006) who carried out a detailed debris flow hazard assessment in five torrent catchments in the Principality of Andorra. Using a magnitude–frequency relationship and a geomorphologic–geologic map, they were able to determine the potential initiation zones and volumes of future debris flows for each catchment. Having this information, they applied a one-dimensional physically based numerical code to analyze the defined scenarios. This was done by evaluating the critical channel sections in the fan area and the <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> on the fan, resulting in intensity maps for each defined scenario and for each modeled event.|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{procedure for}} estimating landslide risk {{to life and}} property is presented and applied in a mountainous area in the Nilgiri hills of southern India. Risk is estimated for elements at risk located in both initiation zones and run-out paths of potential landslides. Loss of life is expressed as individual risk and as societal risk using F-N curves, whereas the direct loss of properties is expressed in monetary terms. An inventory of 1084 landslides was prepared from historical records available for the period between 1987 and 2009. A substantially complete inventory was obtained for landslides on cut slopes (1042 landslides), while for natural slopes information on only 42 landslides was available. Most landslides were shallow translational debris slides and debris flowslides triggered by rainfall. On natural slopes most landslides occurred as first-time failures. For landslide hazard assessment the following information was derived: (1) landslides on natural slopes grouped into three landslide magnitude classes, based on landslide volumes, (2) the number of future landslides on natural slopes, obtained by establishing {{a relationship between the}} number of landslides on natural slopes and cut slopes for different return periods using a Gumbel distribution model, (3) landslide susceptible zones, obtained using a logistic regression model, and (4) distribution of landslides in the susceptible zones, obtained from the model fitting performance (success rate curve). The run-out distance of landslides was assessed empirically using landslide volumes, and the vulnerability of elements at risk was subjectively assessed based on limited historic incidents. Direct specific risk was estimated individually for tea/coffee and horticulture plantations, transport infrastructures, buildings, and people both in initiation and run-out areas. Risks were calculated by considering the minimum, average, and maximum landslide volumes in each magnitude class and the corresponding minimum, average, and <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> distances and vulnerability values, thus obtaining a range of risk values per return period. The results indicate that the total annual minimum, average, and maximum losses are about US$ 44 000, US$ 136 000 and US$ 268 000, respectively. The maximum risk to population varies from 2. 1 &times; 10 &minus; 1 for one or more lives lost to 6. 0 &times; 10 &minus; 2 yr− 1 for 100 or more lives lost. The obtained results will provide a basis for planning risk reduction strategies in the Nilgiri area...|$|E
40|$|Located on {{the western}} Moroccan {{continental}} shelf of the Gulf of Cadiz, the Mercator Mud Volcano (MMV) {{is one of a}} total of eight mud volcanoes which compose the El Arraiche mud volcano field. We collected a high-resolution P-cable 3 D seismic cube during the Charles Darwin cruise 178 in April 2006, covering an area of 25 km 2. The data image the upper 500 - 1000 m of the MMV. El Arraiche mud volcano field is located {{in the top of the}} Tortonian accretionary wedge in the Gulf of Cadiz, between 200 and 700 m water deep. Despite of the general compressive trend of the Gulf of Cadiz due to the westward movement of the Gibraltar arc, the local regimen of the western Moroccan margin is extensional in the study area. The MMV is a 2. 5 km diameter positive conical structure at 350 m water deep that rises from the flank of a salt diapir. The high-resolution 3 D cube shows the main internal structure in the southern flank of an anticline and a secondary structure southwest of it. Parallel and continuous reflections onlapping the anticline structure define the seismic character outside the mud volcano. The body of the main structure shows the typical "Christmas tree" features related to mud flow deposits. The preliminary interpretation of the 3 D seismic cube shows four main mud flows southwestward oriented from the main structure and interfingered into the hemipelagic regional sedimentation. From deeper to shallower, the flows are located approximately at 0. 870 s, 0. 838 s, 0. 774 s, and 0. 685 s travel time, respectively. The extrusions correlate with the main seismic sequences observed in the surrounding hemipelagic deposits. The <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> distance for the mud flows is approximately 1 km southwestward from the main structure, which corresponds to the third youngest mud flow described. The secondary "Christmas tree" structure penetrates the hemipelagic sediments almost to the seabed. Its seismic character is defined by low amplitude and chaotic signal. Several mud flows are interfingered with the surrounding sediments and, in some cases, overlap the mud flows from the main structure but they are less extensive and thinner but more frequent than those from the main structure. The MMV is an active mud volcano and depends on complex fluid and mud dynamics. The existence of a secondary and apparently "abandoned" structure indicates the variation of mud pathways during the evolution of its plumbing system...|$|E
40|$|We {{summarize}} {{the importance of}} great earthquakes (Mw &gtrsim; 8) for hazards, stratigraphy of basin floors, and turbidite lithology along the active tectonic continental margins of the Cascadia subduction zone and the northern San Andreas Transform Fault by utilizing studies of swath bathymetry visual core descriptions, grain size analysis, X-ray radiographs and physical properties. Recurrence times of Holocene turbidites as proxies for earthquakes on the Cascadia and northern California margins are analyzed using two methods: (1) radiometric dating ( 14 C method), and (2) relative dating, using hemipelagic sediment thickness and sedimentation rates (H method). The H method provides (1) the best estimate of minimum recurrence times, which {{are the most important}} for seismic hazards risk analysis, and (2) the most complete dataset of recurrence times, which shows a normal distribution pattern for paleoseismic turbidite frequencies. We observe that, on these tectonically active continental margins, during the sea-level highstand of Holocene time, triggering of turbidity currents is controlled dominantly by earthquakes, and paleoseismic turbidites have an average recurrence time of ~ 550 yr in northern Cascadia Basin and ~ 200 yr along northern California margin. The minimum recurrence times for great earthquakes are approximately 300 yr for the Cascadia subduction zone and 130 yr for the northern San Andreas Fault, which indicates both fault systems are in (Cascadia) or very close (San Andreas) to the early window for another great earthquake. On active tectonic margins with great earthquakes, the volumes of mass transport deposits (MTDs) are limited on basin floors along the margins. The <b>maximum</b> <b>run-out</b> distances of MTD sheets across abyssal-basin floors along active margins are an order of magnitude less (~ 100 km) than on passive margins (~ 1000 km). The great earthquakes along the Cascadia and northern California margins cause seismic strengthening of the sediment, which results in a margin stratigraphy of minor MTDs compared to the turbidite-system deposits. In contrast, the MTDs and turbidites are equally intermixed on basin floors along passive margins with a mud-rich continental slope, such as the northern Gulf of Mexico. Great earthquakes also result in characteristic seismo-turbidite lithology. Along the Cascadia margin, the number and character of multiple coarse pulses for correlative individual turbidites generally remain constant both upstream and downstream in different channel systems for 600 km along the margin. This suggests that the earthquake shaking or aftershock signature is normally preserved, for the stronger (Mw &ge; 9) Cascadia earthquakes. In contrast, the generally weaker (Mw = or Mw &ge; 9) great earthquakes contribute to multi-pulsed and stacked turbidites that are typical for seismo-turbidites generated by a single great earthquake. Earthquake triggering and multi-pulsed or stacked turbidites also become an alternative explanation for amalgamated turbidite beds in active tectonic margins, in addition to other classic explanations. The sedimentologic characteristics of turbidites triggered by great earthquakes along the Cascadia and northern California margins provide criteria to help distinguish seismo-turbidites in other active tectonic margins...|$|E
