40|$|Sedimentary {{rock from}} the Gessoso-solfifera Formation (Messinian) in the Vena del Gesso Basin (northern Italy) {{containing}} immature (Ro = 0. 25 %) S-rich organic matter was artificially matured by hydrous pyrolysis at temperatures from 160 to 330 °C for 72 h to study the diagenetic fate of n-C 37 and n-C 38 di- and tri-unsaturated <b>methyl</b> and <b>ethyl</b> <b>ketones</b> (alkenones) biosynthesised by several prymnesiophyte algae. During early diagenesis, the alkenones are incorporated into the kerogen by both sulphur and oxygen cross-linking as indicated by chemical degradation experiments with the kerogen of the unheated sample. Heating at temperatures between 160 and 260 °C, which still represents early stages of thermal maturation, produces large amounts (up to 1 mg/g TOC) of S-bound, O-bound, and both S- and O-bound n-C 37 and n-C 38 skeletons, saturated n-C 37 and n-C 38 <b>methyl,</b> <b>ethyl,</b> and mid-chain <b>ketones,</b> C 37 and C 38 mid-chain 2, 5 -di-n-alkylthiophenes, C 37 and C 38 1, 2 -di-n-alkylbenzenes, and C 37 and C 38 n-alkanes. With increasing thermal maturation, three forms of the n-C 37 and n-C 38 skeletons are relatively stable (saturated hydrocarbons, 1, 2 -di-n-alkylbenzenes and saturated ketones), whereas the S- and O-bound skeletons are relatively labile. These results suggest that in natural situations saturated ketones with an n-C 37 and n-C 38 skeleton can be expected {{as well as the}} corresponding hydrocarbons...|$|R

25|$|Despite its {{widespread}} {{use as a}} metal degreaser, trichloroethylene itself is unstable {{in the presence of}} metal over prolonged exposure. As early as 1961 this phenomenon was recognized by the manufacturing industry, when stabilizing additives were added to the commercial formulation. Since the reactive instability is accentuated by higher temperatures, the search for stabilizing additives was conducted by heating trichloroethylene to its boiling point in a reflux condenser and observing decomposition. The first widely used stabilizing additive was dioxane; however, its use was patented by Dow Chemical Company and could not be used by other manufacturers. Considerable research took place in the 1960s to develop alternative stabilizers for trichloroethylene.

40|$|Landﬁll bound {{waste from}} the oil palm industry, spent {{bleaching}} clay (SBC) containing significant amounts of adsorbed crude palm oil (CPO) {{has the potential to}} be used for biodiesel production. In this study, SBC was subjected to ultrasound-aided in situ transesteriﬁcation with a co-solvent to convert the oil into methyl esters (biodiesel). Optimized reaction conditions used were 5. 4 wt% KOH, methanol to oil mass ratio of 5. 9 : 1 and 1 : 1 mass ratio of co-solvent (petroleum ether or <b>ethyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone)</b> to SBC. The remaining bleaching clay was calcined at 500 C for 30 min and reutilized for bleaching. Absence of –CH absorption peaks in the FTIR and TGA-FTIR analysis of regenerated clays shows the regeneration efﬁciency of the method. In situ transesteriﬁcation and heat regeneration helped to restore pores without adversely affecting the clay structure.

2500|$|A {{specialized}} industrial route {{entails the}} catalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol. [...] This method is more cost {{effective than the}} esterification but is applied with surplus ethanol in a chemical plant. Typically, dehydrogenation is conducted with copper at an elevated temperature but below 250°C. The copper may have its surface area increased by depositing it on zinc, promoting the growth of snowflake-like fractal structures (dendrites). Surface area can be again increased by deposition onto a zeolite, typically ZSM-5. Traces of rare-earth and alkali metals are beneficial to the process. Byproducts of the dehydrogenation include diethyl ether, which is thought to arise primarily due to aluminum sites in the catalyst, acetaldehyde and its aldol products, higher esters, and ketones. Separations of the byproducts are {{complicated by the fact}} that ethanol forms an azeotrope with water, as does ethyl acetate with ethanol and water, and <b>methyl</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>ketone</b> (MEK, which forms from 2-butanol) with both ethanol and ethyl acetate.

The studies were supported by histopathological examination of liver sections. In vitro activity was assessed by determining the change in hepatocyte viability and other parameters such as GOT, GPT and TPTN. Materials and Methods: The ME of the roots of Baliospermum montanum was prepared and fractionated with chloroform and methanol to get activity guided fraction. The bio-active guided methanol fraction was further fractionated with <b>ethyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> and methanol. Both the fractions were evaluated for hepatoprotective activity against paracetamol-induced toxicity. Statistical Analysis: For determining the significant intergroup difference each parameter was analyzed separately, and {{one-way analysis of variance}} was carried out and the individual comparisons of the group mean values were done using Dunnet′s test. Results: Methanol sub-fraction prevented hepatic damage in vivo, induced by paracetamol, whereas both the sub-fractions showed hepatoprotective effect by restoring altered parameters in the selected in vitro model. The results were comparable with the standard hepatoprotective drug silymarin.

40|$|The alkenones are {{long-chain}} unsaturated <b>methyl</b> and <b>ethyl</b> <b>ketones</b> {{that are}} synthesized by {{a limited number}} of haptophyte microalgae. The proportion of the C 37 di- and tri-unsaturated ketones varies in a systematic way with the growth temperature experienced by these organisms and an index, called U k' 37 and defined as being the ratio [C 37 : 2] /([C 37 : 2]+[C 37 : 3]), was proposed as palaeo-indicator of sea surface temperatures (SST). For alkenones to be reliable measures of SST in the geological record, it is essential that: (1) their sources are correctly attributed (since temperature calibrations can vary from one species to another) and (2) that any diagenetic effects that might alter the original temperature signal established during their initial biosynthesis can be estimated. We have re-examined the double bond positions of the diunsaturated alkenones of several haptophytes (Prahl et al., 2006; Rontani et al., 2006 a). We have demonstrated that the double bond positions in C 37 C 40 homologues occur at a fixed carbon number from the carbonyl group, contrary to early speculations.
