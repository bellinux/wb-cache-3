With a constant <b>margin</b> <b>pressure,</b> predictable flow control and improved efficiency {{can be achieved by}} controlling the orifice area of the flow control valve. Instability due to limit cycles (sustained oscillations) that stem from nonlinearities within the system is a common issue related to hydraulic LS systems. In this work, the stability of the pressure control system was investigated using describing function analysis. Describing function analysis is a method used to approximate a nonlinearity within a nonlinear system and was conducted to predict the existence and stability of limit cycles that occur due to saturation nonlinearities within the mechanical components of the LS system. A combination of linear and nonlinear analysis and modeling was employed to assess the stability of a particular LS pump system. Among many nonlinearities present in the hydro-mechanical LS system, of particular interest was the saturation inherent in the actuator that is used to displace the pump swash plate and the saturation within the 3 -way spool valve that permits flow to reach the actuator. This saturation nonlinearity was believed to be a problematic source for limit cycles that tend to appear in LS systems. A comprehensive nonlinear model was developed as the foundation for this research as it was used for validation in direct comparison to experimentally acquired data. The nonlinear model proved to be precise and accurate in matching to the experimental test bed response based on the data that was gathered.

Conceptually, it consists of two highly interrelated parts. The first one is the evolutionary thesis called Dynamic Finance. This thesis explains the origins and drivers of the profound changes in the global financial landscape. Tilman proposes that the basic key to understanding the behavior of modern financial institutions and capital markets lies in the recognition {{of the fact that the}} process of economic value creation in finance has undergone a fundamental transformation. More specifically, due to significant <b>margin</b> <b>pressures</b> on basic financial businesses, active risk taking has begun to play an increasingly dominant role how financial institutions create (and destroy) shareholder value. In order to demonstrate this, the book introduces the concept of risk-based economic performance that helps depart from the outdated accounting-earnings-inspired mental paradigm. Throughout, the dynamism of risk-taking and business decisions is emphasized as a distinguishing characteristic of the dynamic new world vis-à-vis the old financial regime.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} and theoretical investigation {{has been conducted}} to evaluate the effects seen in axial-flow compressors when the centerline of the rotor is displaced from the centerline of the static structure of the engine. This creates circumferentially nonuniform rotor-tip clearances, unsteady flow, and potentially increased clearances if the rotating and stationary parts come in contact. The result not only adversely affects compressor stall <b>margin,</b> <b>pressure</b> rise capability, and efficiency, but also generates an unsteady, destabilizing, aerodynamic force, called the Thomas/Alford force, which contributes significantly to rotor whirl instabilities in turbomachinery. Determining both the direction and magnitude of this force in compressors, relative to those in turbines, {{is especially important for}} the design of mechanically stable turbomachinery components. Part I of this two-part paper addresses these issues experimentally and Part II presents analyses from relevant computational models. Our results clearly show that the Thomas/Alford force can promote significant backward rotor whirl over much of the operating range of modern compressors, although some regions of zero and forward whirl were found near the design point.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis is to {{determine}} the fair value of a share in the Spanish multinational apparel retailer Inditex, compared to the closing market price 15 th of March 2017. The equity value will be calculated using a discounted cash flow model (DCF), and complemented by a Monte Carlo simulation and a relative valuation. Financial figures for the DCF model are forecasted based on strategic and financial analyses. The strategic analysis uncovers Inditex’s unique position in the apparel industry, being the first apparel company to successfully compete on time-to-market. By owning the whole value chain and using a large distribution center in Spain, they can produce new design in rapid speeds and have new apparel delivered to stores in as little as two weeks. Although this model has resulted in immense growth, the market is catching up and starting to copy their fast fashion model, leading to a fragmented market. In addition, fashion consumers are demanding more personalized apparel and larger focus on sustainability. These facts could negatively influence Inditex’s growth and margins. The financial analysis uncovered a solid company, that has been able to leverage its growth by leasing stores, giving the illusion that it’s an asset light company. This has resulted in a 10 -year average ROIC of 28 %. In addition, all cost margins have been impressively stable in the analyzed period, where sales have grown from € 9 bn in 2007 to € 23 bn in 2016. These facts complement why we expect Inditex to keep on growing. However, margins have been slightly decreasing the latest two years, an effect also seen in peer companies which is in line with the fragmentation of the market witnessed in the strategic analysis. Based on these two analyses, the free cash flows for the next 10 years were forecasted. WACC was estimated to 8, 39 %. The DCF model uncovered a fair share value of € 28, 69. On 15 th of March 2017, the last Inditex shares changed hands on Bolsa de Madrid at € 31, 41, implying that the market is overestimating its equity value by 8, 7 % compared to the DCF model. The same effect was found from the Monte Carlo simulation and multiple analysis, supporting the DCF model.

Complex drilling {{problems such as}} narrow mud-weight windows (narrow <b>pressure</b> <b>margins),</b> severe losses and deep water effects can be significantly reduced. The objectives of the MPD technology are to mitigate certain drilling challenges. Although this drilling technique has been proven to be efficient for several fields, proper candidate selection is essential. It {{is important to understand}} what MPD can accomplish as the technique do have associated risks that needs to be fully understood. Improper use of the technology leads to higher operational costs and possibly worsening of drilling issues. Total E&P Norway is planning to drill an ultra HPHT well (Solaris) in 2015 located in the Central Graben area, an area with several drilling challenges such as narrow <b>pressure</b> <b>margins,</b> uncertainties, high temperature and high pressure. The Solaris well is a challenging well with many similarities to the Mandarin well drilled by BG. The objective is to securely drill through a narrow mud-weight window to the target depth. The goal of this Master Thesis is to define MPD risks and benefits and summarize all findings for the Solaris exploration well. A literature survey on MPD experience with focus on HPHT wells with narrow mud-weight window similar to the Solaris well will be performed, an MPD system is proposed for the Solaris well and risks and benefits of using an MPD system has been closely examined. Based on current available information, literature review and simulation performed (comparing conventional drilling to MPD) it is likely that MPD is the better solution for the Solaris well. The well faces challenges such as a narrow mud-weight window and wellbore breathing issues, challenges that can be mitigated with MPD technology. As MPD do provide better control of the BHP pressure fluctuations are reduced. Target depth {{is more likely to be}} reached as the narrow <b>pressure</b> <b>margins</b> are drilled in a more controlled manner. Conventional drilling is possible for the Solaris well, however as uncertainty is present MPD do provide far better remedies and thereby increases the chance of reaching the target depth.

Materials and Methods: 30 root canal treated, single rooted maxillary anterior teeth of 25 patients in the age range of 18 - 60 years where a post retained crown was indicated were selected for the study between January 2007 and August 2007; and prepared in a standard clinical manner. It was divided into 3 groups of 10 teeth in each group. After post space preparation, the Carbon fiber and Glass fiber reinforced posts were cemented with Scotch bond multipurpose plus bonding agent and RelyX adhesive resin cement in the first and second groups respectively. The Cast post and cores were cemented with Zinc Phosphate cement in the third group. Following post- cementation, the preparation was further refined and a rubber base impression was taken for metal-ceramic crowns which was cemented with Zinc Phosphate cement. A baseline periapical radiograph was taken once each crown was cemented. All patients were evaluated after one week (baseline), 3 months, 6 months and one year for following characteristics mobility of crown <b>margin</b> under finger <b>pressure,</b> recurrent caries detected at the crown margin, fracture of the restoration, fracture of the root and periapical and periodontal pathology. Results: Results after 12 months showed that none of the restorations among groups of cast post and core, carbon fiber reinforced post and glass fiber reinforced post with composite core restorations failed in terms of recurrent caries detected at the crown margin, fracture of the restoration, fracture of the root and periapical and periodontal pathology.

40|$|To {{maintain}} optimum {{mechanical properties}} in glutaraldehyde-treated heart-valve tissue the full collagen crimp geometry originally {{present in the}} relaxed fresh tissue should be retained. By varying the pressure at which glutaraldehyde fixation is carried out, considerable alterations to this crimp geometry can be achieved. The mechanical stiffness of the preserved tissue is consequently affected, and this in turn has a striking influence on both the opening behaviour of the valve {{and the degree of}} strain localisation in the leaflet tissue. A pressure of 100 mmHg eliminated the collagen crimp geometry entirely, and this resulted in the formation of sites of local strain or kinks in the valve leaflets during opening. It is expected that this strain localisation phenomenon will influence the long-term fatigue durability of the treated tissue. Pressures even as low as 4 mmHg result in significant reductions of crimp geometry. Fresh valves should therefore be fixed under a positive head of pressure sufficient only to ensure that the leaflets seal along their coapting free <b>margins.</b> A <b>pressure</b> of less than 1 mmHg was sufficient to achieve this.

40|$|This thesis studies an {{innovative}} working hydraulic system design for mobile applications. The {{purpose is to}} improve the energy efficiency and the dynamic characteristics compared to load sensing systems without increasing the complexity or adding additional components. The system analysed in this thesis is referred to as flow control. The fundamental difference compared to load sensing systems is that the pump is controlled based on the operator’s command signals rather than feedback signals from the loads. This control approach enables higher energy efficiency since the pressure difference between pump and load is given by the system resistance rather than a prescribed pump <b>pressure</b> <b>margin.</b> High power savings are possible especially at medium flow rates. Furthermore, load sensing systems suffer from poor dynamic characteristics since the pump is operated in a closed loop control mode. This might result in an oscillatory behaviour. Flow control systems have no stability issues attached to the load pressure feedback since there is none. Pressure compensators are key components in flow control systems. This thesis addresses the flow matching problem which occurs when using conventional compensators in combination with a flow controlled pump. Flow sharing pressure compensators solve this problem since the pump flow will be distributed between all active functions. A novel control approach where the directional valve is controlled without affecting the cylinder velocity with the objective of optimizing the damping is proposed. In this research, both theoretical studies and practical implementations demonstrate the capability of flow control systems. Experiments show a reduced pump <b>pressure</b> <b>margin</b> and energy saving possibilities in a short loading cycle for a wheel loader application...|$|R

Abstract: Continuous monitoring for 22 months of piezometer and tensiometer nests and displacement and meteorological sensors in the active part of the Slumgullion landslide, southwest Colorado, identified complex relationships between pore pressure and movement. Piezometers were located 3. 4 m from a landslide margin while tensiometers were located 21. 3 m from the margin. Landslide displacement was continuous and generally steady, although velocity spiked following spring snowmelt. Pore-water <b>pressures</b> along the <b>margin</b> dropped 2 m. Pore-water pressures measured away from the margin increased abruptly following rainfall and snowmelt events but mean values were steady. Landslide velocity correlated positively with pore-water pressures measured away from the <b>margin.</b> Pore-water <b>pressures</b> along the <b>margin</b> increased gradually following snowmelt. Cyclic pressure change along the margin occurred with abrupt decrease during landslide acceleration and increase during deceleration, probably due to changes in dilation of shearing landslide debris. Repeated cycles of this type occurred and probably involved dilatant strengthening of shearing landslide debris during acceleration resulting in deceleration and subsequent consolidation of landslide debris and pore-water pressure increase that aided generation of a subsequent acceleration-deceleration cycle...|$|R
40|$|Cement is {{a crucial}} part of well construction. If a good cement bond between the casing and well bore wall cannot be {{achieved}} in the primary cementing, expensive remedial cementing jobs or possible loss of the well bore can occur. When cementing casings and liners in deep waters or pressure depleted reservoirs there is often a small <b>pressure</b> <b>margin</b> between pore <b>pressure</b> and fracture pressure, this makes cement operations more complex. New cementing techniques and cements are being developed to solve the problems in these areas. Light weight cements have for a long time been used as a means to avoid fracturing the cemented formations. The first light weight cements used water and water absorbing solids to lower the cement slurry density. More modern techniques involve using nitrogen gas, hollow glass spheres or a combination of both to make the cement slurry light enough. These methods have proven useful and clearly have their advantages in certain areas. However, the light weight methods also have their limitations so a new method for getting heavy conventional cement down in narrow <b>pressure</b> <b>margin</b> areas has been evaluated. The method is based on reducing the hydrostatic head of fluid above the cement column by displacing the mud in the riser by a lighter fluid. A choke valve placed in bypass over a closed BOP will make it possible to control the pressure so that a constant bottom hole pressure is achieved. The Macondo well in Gulf of Mexico {{has been used as a}} case to evaluate the new method. Hydraulic simulations have been done for cementing a full casing string and for cementing a liner as a production casing in this well. Results from the simulations together with a standard liner cementing procedure have been used to make complete cementing procedures for the new method. Results from the simulations show that the new method could be used with success on the Macondo well. Further analyses of the results show large differences in case of what well geometry the method is used in, and limitations on where the method can be used in terms of water depth. The new method is not applicable in shallow waters as the riser volume in these conditions will be too small. As the riser volume is a limiting factor for the method, completing a well with a full casing string will also reduce the chances it can be used. Even though this thesis shows promising results for the new method for cementing in narrow pressure windows, there is still much work to be done in examining the different aspects of the method further, before an eventual field test. </p...|$|R
40|$|Extraordinary {{developments}} {{are taking place}} at Ghiacciaio del Belvedere near Macugnaga, Valle Anzasca, in the Italian Alps. A surge-type flow acceleration started in the lower parts of the Monte-Rosa east face, leading to strong crevassing and deformation of Ghiacciaio del Belvedere, with extreme bulging of its orographic right <b>margin.</b> High water <b>pressure</b> and accelerated movement lasted into winter 2001 / 2002 : in places, the ice is now starting to override moraines from the Little Ice Age. In addition, but fairly independently, a most active detachment zone for rock falls and debris flows has been developing {{for several years now}} in the east face of Monte Rosa. Besides the scientific interest in these separate phenomena, both events affect the growing hazard potential to the local infrastructure and must be considered seriously...|$|R
40|$|The ASME Codes and {{referenced}} standards provide {{industry and}} the public the necessary rules and guidance for the design, fabrication, inspection and pressure testing of pressure equipment. Codes and standards evolve as the underlying technologies, analytical capabilities, materials and joining methods or experiences of designers improve; sometimes competitive pressures may be a consideration. As an illustration, the design <b>margin</b> for unfired <b>pressure</b> vessels has decreased from 5 : 1 in the earliest ASME Code edition of the early 20 th century {{to the present day}} margin of 3. 5 : 1 in Section VIII Division 1. Design by analysis methods allow designers to use a 2. 4 : 1 margin for Section VIII Division 2 pressure vessels. Code prohibitions are meant to prevent unsafe use of materials, design methods or fabrication details. Codes als...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} to {{the first volume of}} Queering Paradigms suggested that to queer a paradigm is to of fer a challenge to “the hetero/homonormative and gender binarist assumptions of any given academic discourse. ” As queer subjects defy the “seduction of identity by exclusion,” and celebrate “the whole potential of sexuality and gender fluidity and diversity,” any attempt to understand them through the lenses offered by standard discourse is destined to fail (Scherer 2010 : 2). “Queer” is not simply a synonym for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex and Questioning/Queer (LGBTIQ) subjects, as common use might suggest. Rather, it ought to be read as a reference to all who defy being pigeon-holed, pushed to the <b>margins,</b> or being <b>pressured</b> to adopt common social narratives regarding gender and sexuality...|$|R
5000|$|However, they {{recommended}} that structures {{should be designed}} to withstand a wind loading of 56 psf, with a safety factor of 4 (2 where only gravity was relied upon). They noted that higher wind pressures had been recorded at Bidston Observatory but these would still give loadings well within the recommended safety <b>margins.</b> The wind <b>pressures</b> reported at Bidston were probably anomalously high because of peculiarities of the site (one of the highest points on the Wirral.): a wind pressure of 30-40 psf would overturn railway carriages and such events were a rarity. (To give a subsequent, well documented example, in 1903 a stationary train was overturned on the Levens viaduct but this was by a 'terrific gale' measured at Barrow in Furness to have an average velocity of 100 mph, estimated to be gusting up to 120 mph.) ...|$|R
