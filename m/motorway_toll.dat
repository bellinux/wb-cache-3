5|$|Since June 2011, the E751 {{comprises}} the Croatian A8 and A9 tolled motorways of the Istrian Y. The tolls there {{are based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed-toll system. Tolls charged along the A9 <b>motorway</b> <b>toll</b> plazas vary depending on the length of route traveled and range from 3.00 kuna (€0.40) to 26.00 kuna (€3.51) for passenger cars and 15.00 kuna (€2.02) to 185.00 kuna (€25.00) for semi-trailer trucks. Although A8 also employs a ticket system, usage of the road is free except for vehicles traversing the Učka Tunnel and the KanfanarRogovići section. A user of {{the entire length of the}} A8 is charged 36.00 kuna (€4.86) for passenger cars or up to 205.00 kuna (€27.70) for semi-trailers, depending on vehicle classification in Croatia. Ticket systems employed by the A9 and the A8 are unified; tolls are not charged when switching between the two roads. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards, debit cards and a number of prepaid toll collection systems. The latter includes various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC, an electronic toll collection (ETC) system which is used by most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas.|$|E

We introduce a stylised network model capturing these aspects of the Internet to study the impact of differentiation introduced by wireless access on prices and profits. We then study the incentives for, and welfare impact of, a merger between the wireless provider and a local bottleneck fixed access one. These effects crucially depend {{on the degree of}} differentiation between the wireless and fixed Internet access modalities.

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{feasibility}} and possible benefits of amending the German Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) <b>motorway</b> <b>toll</b> system by adopting different pricing and revenue use rules. Economic efficiency and equity effects are assessed using the MOLINO partial equilibrium {{model and the}} ASTRA system dynamics model. Acceptability issues are also addressed using {{the results of a}} survey of actors in the German haulage business. According to first-best welfare theory user charges should be set equal to social marginal costs and the revenues should accrue entirely to the state. However, acceptability and long-term development considerations militate strongly in favour of earmarking revenues to the transport sector. ...|$|E
30|$|Sensors {{are used}} in many {{different}} ways. These range from the real-time monitoring of water quality in oceans through sensors connected to buoys that send information over general packet radio services (GPRS) networks, to monitoring goods being shipped around the world, and smart power grids that create conditions for more rational planning and consumption in production processes, and can all be achieved by means of microchips implanted in objects that communicate with each other. Retailers can tag individual objects using radio frequency identifiers (RFID) to solve {{a number of problems}} all at once. Examples of the areas of application include accurate inventories, control of losses and unattended walk-through point-of-sale terminals. Warehouses can become fully automatic, with items being checked in and out and orders automatically passed to suppliers. Items in transit make intelligent decisions about their routing based on information received from readers and positioning systems. Weather forecasting infrastructure can work with in-ground sensors and irrigation-control software. Irrigation systems can be activated on the basis of intelligent decisions involving the level of moisture in the soil and the likelihood of precipitations. Roadside sensors can detect the flow of cars with RFID-based automatic <b>motorway</b> <b>toll</b> payment tags and provide traffic reports. All sorts of things can give their location to their owners, including keys, wallets, glasses, jewellery and tools. Some IoT-type applications are not new. Among these are toll payment tags, security access key cards, devices to track stolen cars and various types of identity tags for retail goods and livestock.|$|E
