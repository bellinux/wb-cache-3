50|$|CoAP is {{a service}} layer {{protocol}} that {{is intended for}} use in resource-constrained internet devices, such as wireless sensor network nodes. CoAP is designed to easily translate to HTTP for simplified integration with the web, while also meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity. Multicast, low overhead, and simplicity are extremely important for Internet of Things (IoT) and <b>Machine-to-Machine</b> (<b>M2M)</b> devices, {{which tend to be}} deeply embedded and have much less memory and power supply than traditional internet devices have. Therefore, efficiency is very important. CoAP can run on most devices that support UDP or a UDP analogue.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, {{the mobile}} {{industry}} {{became interested in}} using the benefits of virtualization technology for cell phones and other devices like tablets, netbooks and <b>machine-to-machine</b> (<b>M2M)</b> modules. With mobile virtualization, mobile devices can be manufactured more cheaply through the re-use of software and hardware, which shortens development time. One such example is using mobile virtualization to create low-cost Android smartphones without a separate baseband processor by running the applications and the baseband processor code in separate virtual machines on a single processor. Semiconductor vendors such as ST-Ericsson have adopted mobile virtualization {{as part of their}} low-cost Android platform strategy.|$|E
50|$|In June 2006, {{smart card}} {{providers}} Gemplus and Axalto merged to become Gemalto (Portmanteau {{of the original}} company names.) Axalto was a Schlumberger IPO spin-off in 2004. Between the merger and 2015, Gemalto completed a series of acquisitions: the Leigh Mardon’s personalization center (Taiwan), Multos International, NamITech in South Africa, NXP mobile services business, the mobile software solution provider O3SIS, Trusted Logic (the secure software platform provider), Serverside (personalization of bank cards with digital images generated by end users), XIRING’s banking activity, Netsize (a mobile communications service and commerce enabler), Valimo Wireless, a provider in mobile authentication, the internet banking security specialist Todos AB in Sweden, Cinterion the German specialist of <b>machine-to-machine</b> (<b>M2M),</b> SensorLogic (an M2M service delivery platform provider), Plastkart in Turkey, Ericsson’s mobile payment platform IPX and Buzzinbees, the automatic SIM activation expert.|$|E
5000|$|The LoRa Alliance is an open, {{non-profit}} {{association of}} telecom and other providers that are accelerating {{the adoption of}} IoT by delivering related products and services now. The Alliance's mission is to standardize Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) being deployed {{around the world to}} enable Internet of Things (IoT), <b>machine-to-machine</b> (<b>M2M),</b> and smart city and industrial applications. Developing standards will allow service providers to offer interoperable products and services in an open network, and to share both knowledge and best practices. [...] "By leveraging the Internet of Things, municipalities can transform their water systems into open communications systems enabling them to improve the service they offer their customers and increase the connectivity of all city services," [...] said Hassan Ali, {{vice president and general manager}} of Mueller Systems.|$|E
50|$|Random phase {{multiple}} access (RPMA) is the trade name {{given to a}} low-power wide-area channel access method product being sold by Ingenu, formerly On-Ramp Wireless. It {{is meant to be}} used for <b>machine-to-machine</b> (<b>M2M)</b> communication on the Internet of Things (IoT).RPMA is a communication system employing direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) with {{multiple access}}. RPMA reportedly employs transmit power control and receiver sensitivity of (-142dBm) with a total 172 dB link budget. RPMA self modulates to find clear signal both on the network and device level. It is also optimized for coverage and battery efficiency, as opposed to cellular which is designed for high throughput but requires a lot of power. To save battery life, it has a connection protocol in which access points ping the device, check the device status, receive any data, then close the connection. Ingenu estimates that the majority of M2M and IoT connections need this kind of low data throughput and high battery life connectivity.|$|E
50|$|USA Technologies Inc. is an American company {{known for}} its work with ePort cashless {{acceptance}} technology running on their patented ePort Connect service a PCI compliant, comprehensive suite of services designed specifically for the self serve, unattended market. ePort Connect wirelessly facilitates electronic payment options to consumers (so that payment {{can be made with}} credit, debit, or NFC enabled electronic wallets like Apple Pay and Android Pay) while providing operators with both telemetry and <b>machine-to-machine</b> (<b>M2M)</b> services. ePort technology is primarily found in vending machines, kiosks and point-of-sale (POS) terminals, but the ePort Online and ePort Mobile products have extended the network to accept recurring payments from a PC or retail outlets and the taxi industry through smartphone devices. The company also produced other technology to address needs within the unattended industry such as the More Prepaid and Loyalty consumer engage program, ePort beacon, facilitating Bluetooth payment options, and the EnergyMiser, a device that reduces the energy consumption of vending machines.|$|E
5000|$|Kevin Lonergan at Information Age, a business-technology magazine, has {{referred}} to the terms surrounding IoT as a “terminology zoo”. The lack of clear terminology is not “useful from a practical point of view” and a “source of confusion for the end user”. A company operating in the IoT space could be working in anything related to sensor technology, networking, embedded systems, or analytics. According to Lonergan, the term IoT was coined before smart phones, tablets, and devices {{as we know them}} today existed, and there is a long list of terms with varying degrees of overlap and technological convergence: Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Everything (IoE), Industrial Internet, Pervasive Computing, Pervasive Sensing, Ubiquitous Computing, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Smart Objects, Cooperating Objects, <b>Machine-to-Machine</b> (<b>M2M),</b> Ambient Intelligence (AmI), Operational Technology (OT), and Information Technology (IT). Regarding IIoT, an industrial sub-field of IoT, the Industrial Internet Consortium's Vocabulary Task Group has created a [...] "common and reusable vocabulary of terms" [...] to ensure [...] "consistent terminology" [...] across publications issued by the Industrial Internet Consortium. IoT One has created an IoT Terms Database including a New Term Alert to be notified when a new term is published. As of March 2017, this database aggregates 711 IoT-related terms, however, without any attempts to reduce terminological ambiguity and complexity.|$|E
