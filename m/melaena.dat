5|$|The short-finned {{pilot whale}} was described, from {{skeletal}} materials only, by John Edward Gray in 1846. He presumed from the skeleton that the whale had a large beak. The long-finned pilot whale was first classified by Thomas Stewart Traill in 1809 as Delphinus melas. Its scientific name was eventually changed to Globicephala <b>melaena.</b> Since 1986, the specific name of the long-finned pilot whale was changed to its original form melas. Other species classifications have been proposed but only two have been accepted. There exist geographic forms of {{short-finned pilot whale}}s off {{the east coast of}} Japan, which comprise genetically isolated stocks.|$|E
25|$|Grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) {{are common}} around the shorelines. Several species of cetacea {{live in the}} waters around the Faroe Islands. Best known are the long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala <b>melaena),</b> which are still hunted by the islanders in {{accordance}} with longstanding local tradition. Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are regular visitors around the islands.|$|E
25|$|Recently, M. laryngeus worms {{were found}} in the {{duodenum}} of a Thai patient, which was the first gastrointestinal case of ammomonogamiasis. The patient complained of chest pain, haematemesia, <b>melaena,</b> and abdominal bloating, but no respiratory symptoms. Although nothing conclusive was determined, t the adult worms perhaps were dislodged from the larynx, reswallowed, and later found in the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|There are {{records of}} drive hunts in the Faroe Islands dating from 1584. Whaling in the Faroe Islands is {{regulated}} by Faroese authorities {{but not by}} the International Whaling Commission as there are disagreements about the Commission's legal authority to regulate cetacean hunts. Hundreds of long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala <b>melaena)</b> could be killed in a year, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called grindadráp in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level; anyone can participate. When a whale pod by chance is spotted near land the participating hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats and then slowly and quietly begin to drive the whales towards the chosen authorised bay. When a pod of whales has been stranded the killing is begun. Faroese animal welfare legislation, which also applies to whaling, requires that animals are killed as quickly and with as little suffering as possible. A regulation spinal lance is used to sever the spinal cord, which also severs the major blood supply to the brain, ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds. The spinal lance has been introduced as preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales and {{has been shown to}} reduce killing time to 1–2 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{cetacean}} species {{to move through}} the waters of the greater Hans Lollik area include bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). [...] Some pilot whales (Globicephala <b>melaena)</b> may also occur in the area. [...] The presence of humpback whales is seasonal, with peak migrations occurring during January through March. [...] In addition to reef fish, schooling fish have been evaluated in the area around GHL and Litte Hans Lollik.

50|$|She {{was said}} to have been loved by Apollo and bore him Delphos, the eponymous founder of town Delphi, beside the oracular shrine. She was also closely {{associated}} with the prophetic Castalian Spring, from which she was sometimes said to have been born (Pausanias follows a tradition that made her daughter of the autochthon Castalius). Thyia was also related to Castalia, the nymph of the spring; <b>Melaena,</b> an alternative mother for Delphos; and the Corycian nymphs, Naiades of the springs of the holy Corycian Cave.|$|E

50|$|This is {{a common}} and confiding bird of primary and second growth forest, usually found in small groups. The female lays two purple-marked white eggs, which are {{incubated}} by both sexes for 16 days to hatching, in a small plant fibre and dead leaf cup nest low in a tree or shrub. The white-flanked antwren feeds on small insects and other arthropods taken from twigs and foliage in the lower branches of trees. It has a queep whistle followed by a trilled trrrrrr. M. a. <b>melaena</b> has a two note call, naa-who and a whistled descending pee pee pee-pee-pee-pee-pee-puu-puu call. Given the differences in plumage and vocalisations, the two forms may possibly be different species.|$|E

50|$|The Faroe Islands also depend {{almost entirely}} on fisheries, salmon farming, tourism and related exports. Without Danish Government bailouts in 1992 and 1993, the Faroese economy would have gone bankrupt. Since 1995, the Faroese economy has seen a {{noticeable}} upturn, but remains vulnerable. Recent off-shore oil finds close to the Faroese area give hope for Faroese deposits, too, which may {{form the basis for}} an economic rebound over the longer term. Like Greenland, the Faroe Islands are also known for its whale hunting, around 950 long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala <b>melaena)</b> are caught each year, mainly during the summer. This should be seen {{in the context of an}} estimated local pilot whale population of more than 100,000. Other species are not hunted, though occasionally Atlantic white-sided dolphin can be found among the pilot whales. The Faroese whale slaughter has recently been under attack by the media because of the way it is generally perceived. The whale hunting is not a commercial industry, of no significance to the economy other than the fact that the Faroes need to import less meat from other animals because people get meat for free from the pilot whales, and the whales are for local consumption only.|$|E
