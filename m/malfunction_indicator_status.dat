When this happens, engine {{performance}} will often decrease significantly, engine emissions will be greatly increased, and usually the <b>Malfunction</b> <b>Indicator</b> Lamp (MIL) will illuminate.

Some engines do not idle with an air flow meter failure.|$|R

40|$|DISCUSSION: The {{on-board}} diagnostics II (OBD II) regulation requires all vehicle manufacturers to monitor virtually every emission-control component and {{system that can}} cause increases in emissions. When an emission-related malfunction is detected, the OBD II system alerts the vehicle owner by illuminating the <b>malfunction</b> <b>indicator</b> light (MIL) on the vehicle instrument panel. By alerting the owner of malfunctions as they occur, repairs can be sought promptly, which results in fewer emissions from the vehicle. Manufacturers began phase-in of the OBD II requirements in 1994, with full implementation required on all 1996 and newer model year vehicles. The Air Resources Board (ARB) last adopted modifications to the curren...|$|R

5000|$|The {{oxygen sensor}} {{is the basis}} of the {{closed-loop}} control system on a spark-ignited rich-burn engine; however, it is also used for diagnostics. In vehicles with OBD II, a second oxygen sensor is fitted after the catalytic converter to monitor the O2 levels. The O2 levels are monitored to see the efficiency of the burn process. The on-board computer makes comparisons between the readings of the two sensors. The readings are taken by voltage measurements. If both sensors show the same output or the rear O2 is [...] "switching", the computer recognizes that the catalytic converter either is not functioning or has been removed, and will operate a <b>malfunction</b> <b>indicator</b> lamp and affect engine performance. Simple [...] "oxygen sensor simulators" [...] have been developed to circumvent this problem by simulating the change across the catalytic converter with plans and pre-assembled devices available on the Internet. Although these are not legal for on-road use, they have been used with mixed results. Similar devices apply an offset to the sensor signals, allowing the engine to run a more fuel-economical lean burn that may, however, damage the engine or the catalytic converter.|$|R
