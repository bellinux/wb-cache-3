5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle <b>makes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} definite {{reference to}} cricket is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 (i.e., a Julian date which is 1598 by modern reckoning under the Gregorian calendar). It is a deposition in {{the records of}} a legal case at Guildford, Surrey, re {{the use of a}} parcel of land c.1550 and John Derrick, a coroner, testified that he had at that time played cricket on the land when he was a boy. Derrick's testimony <b>makes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the sport was being played c.1550, but its true origin is a mystery. All that can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that its beginning was earlier than 1550, somewhere in south-east England within the counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. Unlike other games with batsmen, bowlers and fielders, such as stoolball and rounders, cricket can only be played on relatively short grass, especially as the ball was delivered along the ground until the 1760s. Therefore, forest clearings and land where sheep had grazed would have been suitable places to play.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, the {{variance}} of the mean {{of a large number}} of standardized variables is approximately equal to their average correlation.

25|$|Her work <b>makes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> for medieval readers the act {{of reading}} itself had an oral phase in which the text was read aloud or sub-vocalized (silent reading was a less common variant, and {{appears to have been}} the {{exception}} rather than the rule), then meditated upon and 'digested' hence making it one's own. She asserts that both 'textual' activities (picturing and reading) have as their goal the internalization of knowledge and experience in memory.|$|E
25|$|A full {{statement}} {{of the theory of}} lesya occurs in chapter 34 of the Uttaradhyayana, one of the fundamental sutras of the scriptural canon. Inspection of the metrical structure there, which consists of a cluster of old sloka verses amplified by twice as many verses in the arya metre, <b>makes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> a great deal of ancient editorial care was taken to ensure that an original rudimentary description of this dimension of karma became fully cogent.|$|E
25|$|When the king's enemies struck, the {{defection}} of Shropshire was {{a critical}} juncture in the rapid collapse that followed. Burley quickly rallied to Thomas FitzAlan, the dispossessed claimant to the earldom, when he returned with Henry Bolingbroke in 1399. Adam of Usk's account of the rebels' march through Shropshire <b>makes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> they met with a welcome in the county and hints at how this shaped the future power structure of the county, with Thomas Arundel, now Archbishop of Canterbury giving ecclesiastical sanction to the new arrangements.|$|E

25|$|Wulfhere donated land at Lichfield for Chad {{to build}} a monastery. It was because of this that {{the centre of the}} Diocese of Mercia {{ultimately}} became settled at Lichfield. The Lichfield monastery was probably similar to that at Lastingham, and Bede <b>makes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> it was partly staffed by monks from Lastingham, including Chad's faithful retainer, Owin. Lichfield was very close to the old Roman road of Watling Street, the main route across Mercia, and a short distance from Mercia's main royal centre at Tamworth.|$|E
25|$|The {{vessel that}} Esperance {{was built in}} America and {{launched}} in 1781, probably under the name Clementina. She first appears in Lloyd's Register in 1783 A database of slave trading voyages by vessels from Liverpool <b>makes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Clementina was a slave trader. The next year Captain J. Elworthy sailed her to West Central Africa and St Helena. He transported his slaves to South Carolina. then in 1785 Elworthy gathered slaves in the Bight of Biafra and the Gulf of Guinea Islands that he delivered to Jamaica.|$|E

25|$|Orazio died {{suddenly}} in 1639. Artemisia {{had her own}} commissions to fulfill after her father's death, {{although there are no}} known works assignable with certainty to this period. It is known that Artemisia had already left England by 1642, when the civil war was just starting. Nothing much is known about her subsequent movements. Historians know that in 1649 she was in Naples again, corresponding with Don Antonio Ruffo of Sicily, who became her mentor during this second Neapolitan period. The last known letter to her mentor is dated 1650 and <b>makes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> she still was fully active.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and early 1940s, Edsel—who was {{president}} of the company—thought Ford had to come to some sort of collective bargaining agreement with the unions because the violence, work disruptions, and bitter stalemates could not go on forever. But Ford, who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir <b>makes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Ford's purpose in putting Bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet {{performance}} was also beset by errors. Soviet intelligence on German {{forces in the}} pocket was faulty in overestimating their strength. At the same time, the Soviets underestimated German capability for a counter-attack and had to hurriedly move more forces forward to bolster {{the strength of their}} encircling rings. The Soviet air force was unable to significantly hinder the German aerial resupply effort. Ultimately, the encircling forces were unable to prevent a German breakout, allowing {{a significant portion of the}} trapped Germans to escape. Given the initial circumstances of the battle, the degree of Soviet losses <b>makes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> while the Soviets won at Korsun, it was a victory that came at a high price.|$|E
