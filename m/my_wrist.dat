500|$|E.W. Swanton {{wrote that}} this [...] "could {{well have been}} so for {{he was a man}} of quixotic mood and temperament". However the England bowler, Alec Bedser wrote [...] "It was when I was bowling to Sid at Sydney that I first {{discovered}} that I could move the ball to leg by use of <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> and fingers...I held the ball in the same manner as a leg-break bowler with the fingers across the seam...and on pitching I was surprised to see the ball go away like a leg-break. It also surprised Sid Barnes". This would make Barnes the first batsman to be dismissed by Bedser's [...] "Special Ball" [...] which would claim Bradman for a duck in the Fourth Test at Adelaide.|$|E
2500|$|... "I had {{went through}} {{a lot of things in}} my life that had driven me to a darker path than most choose to take. I split the flesh on <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> with a box opener, {{painting}} the floor of my bedroom with blood I shouldn't have spilt. After sitting there for what seemed like hours (which apparently was only minutes), I had the revelation that this was not the path. It was my dicision (sic) to seek medical treatment, as on the other hand I could have chose to sit there until enough blood drained from my downward lascerations on my wrists to die." ...|$|E
2500|$|Every {{morning before}} {{beginning}} work, I visited the animals. One of the elephants, Candy, loved to be scratched on the belly behind her foreleg. I'd scratch {{her and she}} would lean farther and farther toward me until there was some danger of her toppling over on me. One time I started {{to walk away from}} her, and she reached out and took <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> with her trunk and pulled me back to her side. It was a command: [...] "Don't stop!" [...] I used it in the picture. Noah scratches the elephant's belly and walks away, and the elephant pulls him back to her time after time.|$|E

2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Faith 7 flight {{there were}} mission-threatening {{technical}} problems. During the 19th orbit, the capsule had a power failure. Carbon dioxide levels began rising, and the cabin temperature jumped to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38°C). Cooper turned to his understanding of star patterns, took manual control of the tiny capsule and successfully estimated the correct pitch for re-entry into the atmosphere. Some precision was needed in the calculation, since if the capsule came in too steep, g-forces would be too large, and if its trajectory were too shallow, it would shoot out of the atmosphere again, back into space. Cooper drew lines on the capsule window to help him check his orientation before firing the re-entry rockets. [...] "So I used <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> watch for time," [...] he later recalled, [...] "my eyeballs out the window for attitude. Then I fired my retrorockets at the right time and landed right by the carrier." [...] Cooper's cool-headed performance and piloting skills led to a basic rethinking of design philosophy for later space missions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} {{was not yet}} lost, England had at least played on the spinning wicket first and it could only get worse for Australia. Doug Wright was the terror of the County Championship for running through side on just such wickets and Hammond also had Peter Smith and the part-time spin of Ikin, Compton and Hutton. Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris only batted for 9 minutes when the rain came down and the teams left the field. On their return Bill Edrich (3/71) made the ball kick up with his fast bowling, and Morris was bowled while taking evasive action. Ian Johnson [...] came in as a nightwatchman and he and Barnes angered the crowd by launching {{into a series of}} bad light appeals - up to 12 were counted - before the umpires gave way and play was ended with an hour to spare. This gamesmanship ensured that Australia would not have to play on a sticky wicket like England at Brisbane and allowed Bradman to rest his leg until play resumed on the Monday. Clif Cary opined in his radio commentary that the light was bright enough to play by and the umpires had been pressured into a decision by the Australian batsmen, as did the English pressmen. They were labelled [...] "biased, unsportsmanlike squealers" [...] and that Barnes and his captain Bradman would never used such underhand tactics, {{but at the end of}} the series Barnes admitted on radio that he had bluffed the umpires into the decision. Sunday was a rest day and the sun dried out the wicket beautifully, it rolled to perfection and produced the flat wicket anticipated on the first day. Barnes had been reprimanded for hooking the ball in the First Test and as a result denied himself strokeplay and slowly ground his way through the day. Johnson was out for 7, and Barnes added 59 with Lindsay Hassett (34) and 63 with Keith Miller (40). Alec Bedser (1/153) [...] bowled well and stopped the runs from getting away, but with defensive fields many catches went begging, but Peter Smith (2/172) failed to find his form (he was hospitalised with appendicitis on the tour). Don Bradman had lowered himself down the order and [...] "limped as if in extreme pain, and several times lay on the ground as if ill" [...] Wright (1/169) “bowled beautifully with the most wretched luck”, in one over [...] "On four occasions Hammond, usually most undemonstrative, threw his hands in the air as the ball beat Bradman and shaved the stumps, and in between these near dismissals there was a confident appeal for leg before wicket. When Bradman was on 22 when he appeared to snick another catch to Jack Ikin at short leg, but [...] "this time there may have been some cause for doubt; it was an appeal that could have gone either way". Bradman was given not out and by the end of the day Barnes was 109, Bradman 52 and Australia 252/4. On the Tuesday Bradman gave [...] "an amazing exhibition in amassing 234 runs - that is, amazing for one who was supposed to be a cripple. He played all the shots, pulled leg muscle and all, and often ran between the wickets with the speed of an Olympic sprinter". Forced to play off the back foot due to his pulled leg muscle Bradman still looked like he had three strokes for every one of Barnes and by the end of the day had caught him up in runs. During this long partnership Len Hutton joked with the crowd on the boundary and ate 14 bananas given to him from the Hill. In desperation Hammond called on his vice-captain Norman Yardley to bowl his medium pacers, which he did not even do for Yorkshire, and to everyone's surprise he caught Bradman lbw for 234. It was only the second time Bradman had been lbw in a Test against England, the first being to Maurice Tate on his debut in 1928. He had added 405 for the fifth wicket with Barnes, and in 1946 this was the highest partnership for that wicket in Test or first-class cricket and the second highest Test partnership after the 451 Bradman-Ponsford partnership at the Oval in 1934. In the next over Barnes hit Bedser to Ikin also for 234, his maiden Test century and the highest score of his career. He said later that he had got himself out so as to have the same score as Bradman [...] "which could well have been so for he was a man of quixotic mood and temperament". However, Alec Bedser wrote [...] "It was when I was bowling to Sid at Sydney that I first discovered that I could move the ball to leg by use of <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> and fingers...I held the ball in the same manner as a leg-break bowler with the fingers across the seam...and on pitching I was surprised to see the ball go away like a leg-break. It also surprised Sid Barnes". Australia ended the fourth day on 571/6. The next morning the lower order struck out, with Fred Freer hitting 3 fours and a six in his 28 not out and George Tribe 5 fours in his 25 not out until [...] Bradman declared on 659/8.|$|E
60|$|I leaned towards Louis, but he {{anticipated}} my question. His {{hand had}} caught <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> and was pinning {{it down to}} the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are safe," [...] she began, glancing {{first at}} the palm ropes that lay upon the rock and then at <b>my</b> <b>wrists,</b> {{one of which was}} cut.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} it," [...] I said. [...] "You {{were dressed}} up as Father Christmas. It was I who put out the fire; <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> were burnt in doing so." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{pulled out}} my knife, and {{severing}} the line at <b>my</b> <b>wrist,</b> walked away, looking for some one to introduce me to Smarty Mellor." ...|$|E
60|$|I stole {{a look at}} his gnarled hands. Any finger {{would have}} made three of mine. His wrist would have made three of <b>my</b> <b>wrist.</b>|$|E
60|$|At {{this she}} let go <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> and covered {{her face with her}} hands passionately. When she dropped them she had the look of one morally crushed.|$|E
60|$|Knowing that {{it would}} be folly to resist, I allowed them to do as Moran had advised. <b>My</b> <b>wrists</b> were knotted {{together}} behind my back, and then the cord was drawn tightly about my waist.|$|R
60|$|When I awoke it {{was with}} a start to find a couple of huge Sagoths astride me. They pinioned my arms and legs, and later chained <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> behind <b>my</b> back. Then they let me up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I Master of the earth?" [...] he said. [...] "Or is your Society? Now. Take {{your hands}} off those levers, and hold <b>my</b> <b>wrists.</b> Yes--so. And now, how do we turn her nose down to the glide?" ...|$|R

60|$|And {{with great}} gravity he drew {{from his pocket}} a pair of ancient handcuffs, one of which he {{attached}} to <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> {{and the other to}} his own.|$|E
6000|$|I {{go in the}} rain, and, {{more than}} needs, [...] A rope cuts both <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> behind; And I think, by the feel, my {{forehead}} bleeds, [...] For they fling, whoever has a mind, Stones at me for my year's misdeeds.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have so quarrelled with myself, Yorke. I have so kicked {{against the}} pricks, and {{struggled}} in a strait waistcoat, and dislocated <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> with wrenching them in handcuffs, and battered my hard head by driving it against a harder wall." ...|$|R
60|$|Work! More {{than once}} I sank {{down on the}} coal where {{no one could see}} me, and cried with rage, and mortification, and exhaustion, and despair. That second day was my hardest, and all that enabled me to survive it and get in the last of the night coal at the end of {{thirteen}} hours was the day fireman, who bound both <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> with broad leather straps. So tightly were they buckled that they were like slightly flexible plaster casts. They took the stresses and pressures which hitherto had been borne by <b>my</b> <b>wrists,</b> and they were so tight that {{there was no room for}} the inflammation to rise in the sprains.|$|R

6000|$|... "I got <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> {{like this}} last night, wrestling with him. He swore he'd go and leave me, but I held him, I did. And don't {{you ever think}} that I'll let him go to that young girl--not if he kills me first!" ...|$|R
60|$|They led {{me aside}} into that place of torments, {{and one of}} them drew down the ropes from the pulley overhead, until the ends fell on a level with <b>my</b> <b>wrists.</b> And this was torture of the second degree--to see its imminence.|$|R
6000|$|... "The fall, Señor," [...] {{answered}} d'Aguilar; [...] "I {{think that}} it has broken <b>my</b> <b>wrist.</b> But I have still my left hand. Suffer me to arise, and we will finish this fray." ...|$|E

60|$|Here {{they threw}} me upon the ground, binding my ankles {{together}} and trussing {{them up to}} <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> behind. There they left me, lying upon my stomach--a most uncomfortable and strained position, to which was added the pain where the cords cut into my flesh.|$|R
60|$|The executioners laid hold of me, {{and in the}} {{twinkling}} of an eye I stood naked to the waist. I {{caught my}} lips in my teeth as the ropes were being adjusted to <b>my</b> <b>wrists,</b> and as thus I suffered torture of the third degree.|$|R
