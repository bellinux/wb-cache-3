25|$|The first {{permanent}} air supported membrane domes {{were the}} radar domes {{designed and built}} by Walter Bird after World War II. Their low cost {{eventually led to the}} development of permanent versions using teflon-coated fiberglass and by 1985 the majority of the domed stadiums around the world used this system. Tensegrity domes, patented by Buckminster Fuller in 1962, are membrane structures consisting of radial trusses made from steel cables under tension with vertical steel pipes spreading the cables into the truss form. They have been made circular, elliptical, and other shapes to cover stadiums from Korea to Florida. Tension membrane design has depended upon computers, and the increasing availability of powerful computers resulted in many developments being <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> three decades of the 20th century. The higher expense of rigid large span domes made them relatively rare, although rigidly moving panels is the most popular system for sports stadiums with retractable roofing.|$|E
25|$|Minor {{improvements}} to Woodland Cemetery were <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> {{decade of the}} 19th century. In 1888, a small wooden, enclosed pavilion was erected {{on the ground to}} provide employees with a place to eat and store tools. A fence was erected around the cemetery's stoneyard to screen it from view, a stone path was built from the Woodland Avenue gatehouse to the chapel, and all walks were cindered. The central water main was replaced, and a public drinking fountain added near the chapel. The chapel's receiving vault was updated to accommodate a trend toward larger caskets, box gutters were installed throughout the cemetery to replace ditch gutters, and the two gatekeeper's houses and the foreman's house were both repaired and refurbished. In 1889, the chapel was connected to the water main for the first time. Due to limited burial space, two grassy areas around the chapel were converted into burial plots.|$|E
25|$|Clark {{realized}} {{that as long}} as the centre-right vote was divided, there was no chance of dislodging the Liberals. However, he wanted a merger on his terms. He got his chance in 2001, when several dissident Alliance MPs, the most prominent one being Alliance deputy leader and party matriarch Deborah Grey, left the Alliance caucus. The dissidents felt that Alliance leader Stockwell Day hadn't learned from mistakes <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> election. While some of them rejoined the Alliance later, seven of them, led by Chuck Strahl of British Columbia and including Grey, refused and formed the Democratic Representative Caucus. The DRC quickly entered a coalition with the Progressive Conservatives, which lasted until 2002 when Stephen Harper ousted Day as Alliance leader. Harper wanted a closer union with the PCs, but Clark turned the offer down, and all but two of the DRC members rejoined the Alliance. One of the two, Inky Mark, eventually joined the PCs. Two by-election victories later in 2002 increased the PC caucus to 15 members and fourth place in the Commons. However, Clark was unable to gain any ground in Ontario and resigned on August 6, 2002.|$|E

500|$|A {{review in}} Brassey's Guide to War Films by Alun Evans was critical, calling the film [...] "Arguably the worst war picture <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> {{quarter of the}} 20th century". Robert Niemi commented in his book History in the Media: Film and Television, [...] "Plagued with a terrible script, horrendous {{production}} problems, and shoddy performances all around, the resulting film, Inchon ... was bad beyond belief." [...] Niemi wrote that Olivier's performance [...] "was a low point in an otherwise distinguished film career". In his biography of the actor, Olivier, author Terry Coleman called the film [...] "probably the worst he ever made {{and one of the}} best paid". Author Lawrence H. Suid wrote in Guts and Glory: The Making of the American Military Image in Film that [...] "what combat the film portrayed lacked any believability or authenticity... As a result, the movie met with almost unanimous critical disdain."

Reviewers especially took issue {{with the lack of}} creativity in level design, which Destructoid's Jim Sterling called [...] "tedious corridors full of identical, monotonous, brainless combat encounters". Hardcore Gamers Nikola Suprak commented that several of the levels he played through were visually indistinct from one another, before saying that [...] "level after level of redundant action and repetitive encounters ultimately drag the game down". Critics also noted that the game had a number of technical issues. Sterling ran into two situations where glitches would not allow him to progress without restarting the level, while Sam Turner of The Digital Fix experienced dramatic drops in frame rate during gameplay, and crashed to desktop several times.|$|E

[...] Barry Nicolson of NME commented, [...] "Once the source of pop inspiration, now it seems they're content to follow", concluding that the album is [...] "basically an upbeat electro-pop record with one foot in the '80s, much like roughly 85 per cent of music <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two years."
