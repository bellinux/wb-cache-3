40|$|Nowadays, {{a lot of}} {{development}} of Web applications use prototyping approach such as throw-away prototyping and evolutionary prototyping. In order to fulfill the users' requirements, developers need {{to communicate with the}} users, therefore prototyping is widely used in software development to assist these developers. As we develop Web application and release them as a number of versions or releases of prototype, it constantly requires changes to evolve and meet users' specific requirements. Thus, prototyping approach may cause more maintenance cost to be incurred due to scope creep during software development. In addition, it provides the challenges to a maintenance team who is mostly not the actual development team, to manage and track maintenance process of such Web applications. This paper proposes a user-centered technique for managing and tracking <b>modification</b> <b>requests</b> in a Web application. We anticipate that the proposed technique can assist maintainers to manage and track modification of a Web application in more effective and efficient manner by capturing, classifying and validating the enhancement requests, problem report and <b>modification</b> <b>requests</b> directly from the users during the prototyping process itself. This in turn will avoid unexpected <b>modification</b> <b>requests</b> once we release the Web application and to allow the tracing of both enhancement and problem report during prototyping and <b>modification</b> <b>requests</b> and problem report during maintenance...|$|R

40|$|Software {{evolution}} {{refers to}} the process of adapting software systems to <b>modification</b> <b>request</b> caused by requirements and technology changes that occur after the initial system delivery. Prior to implementing a requirements change, decision-makers must determine if a <b>modification</b> <b>request</b> is feasible and the cost associated with it. Traditional modification analysis approaches have focused mainly on the analysis of source code to determine the potential impact of a change. In this research, we present a novel approach to support modification analysis early in the software evolution lifecycle thus allowing management, who are not necessarily familiar with the detailed system implementation, to determine the impact associated with a <b>modification</b> <b>request.</b> In our research we develop several analysis techniques to support the system evolution at the requirements level, namely impact analysis at the requirements level, prediction of regression testing effort, feature interaction analysis including detecting potential bad smells of the requirements, in order to provide support for improving the comprehensibility and maintainability of requirements. In our approach, we combine Use Case Maps, as a notation to model requirements, with Formal Concept Analysis in order to explore the applicability of Formal Concept Analysis during modification analysis at the requirements level. We implemented a proof of concept tool and several case studies are presented to demonstrate the applicability of our methodology...|$|E

Estimating how people should communicate to accommodate <b>modification</b> <b>requests</b> have been recognized as a prominent problem in software maintenance. In this paper, we contribute a pluggable framework to anticipate coordination requirements based on change scope prediction, supporting interchangeable change scope prediction algorithms either solely based on architecture or co-change patterns. Using <b>modifications</b> <b>requests</b> from eleven releases of the open source Hadoop project, we evaluate our approach by comparing predicted coordination requirements with actual bug tracker communications. In our evaluation, we obtain an average precision of 68 % and recall of 48 % in accurately predicting coordination requirements, showing that this approach has the potential to assist managers in anticipating problematic coordination when performing software modifications.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} use and type of source code {{employed}} during program summaries which describe software maintenance tasks. The data consists of eighty-eight program summaries extracted from online developer mailing lists.

A subset of three categories from a content analysis schema have been isolated for this investigation, the three source code categories cover descriptions of single lines of code, code excerpts and blocks of code. The use of these three categories were examined between the theme groupings as well as within the themes, that is, differences between the task types. The results were not as frequent as expected.

DOE and Sandia are requesting that the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) designate solid waste management unit (SWMU) 76 as approved for Corrective Action Complete status. NMED made a preliminary determination in October 2014 that corrective action is complete at this SWMU. SWMU 76, known as the Mixed Waste Landfill (MWL), is a 2. 6 -acre site at Sandia National Laboratories, located on Kirtland Air Force Base immediately southeast of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Radioactive wastes and mixed wastes (radioactive wastes that are also hazardous wastes) were disposed of in the MWL from March 1959 through December 1988. The meximum depth of burial is approximately 25 feet below the ground surface. Groundwater occurs approximately 500 feet below the ground surface at the MWL. DOE and Sandia have implemented corrective measures at SWMU 76 in accordance with the requirements of the Permit; an April 2004 Compliance Order on Consent between NMED, DOE, and Sandia; and the plans approved by NMED. On January 8, 2014, NMED approved a long-term monitoring and maintenance plan (LTMMP) for SWMU 76.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} versioning {{file system}} creates and retains a new file version for every WRITE or other <b>modification</b> <b>request.</b> The resulting history of file modifications provides a detailed view to tools and administrators seeking {{to investigate a}} suspect system state. Conventional versioning systems do not efficiently record the many prior versions that result. In particular, the versioned metadata they keep consumes almost as much space as the versioned data. This paper examines two space-efficient metadata structures for versioning file systems and describes their integration into the Comprehensive Versioning File System (CVFS). Journal-based metadata encodes each metadata version into a single journal entry; CVFS uses this structure for inodes and indirect blocks, reducing the associated space requirements by 80 %. Multiversion b-trees extend the per-entry key with a timestamp and keep current and historical entries in a single tree; CVFS uses this structure for directories, reducing the associated space requirements by 99 %. Experiments with CVFS verify that its current-version performance {{is similar to that}} of non-versioning file systems. Although access to historical versions is slower than conventional versioning systems, checkpointing is shown to mitigate this effect.
