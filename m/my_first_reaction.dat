Rodgers initially did {{not want}} Madonna to record [...] "Like a Virgin", as {{he felt that the}} lyric 'like a virgin' was not a terrific hook; according to him it was not an all-time catch phrase. Rogers dismissed the song after hearing the demo, which he thought sounded [...] "really stupid and retarded". Later, Rodgers had second thoughts: [...] "It's weird because I couldn't get it out of my head after I played it, even though I didn't really like it. It sounded really bubble-gummy to me, but it grew on me. I really started to like it. [...] But, <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>reaction</b> to it was, 'This is really queer.'" [...] Rodgers credits Madonna with recognizing the song's potential. He later said: [...] "I handed my apology to Madonna and said, 'you know... if it's so catchy that it stayed in my head for four days, it must be something. So let's do it.'" [...] Hence the song was finally recorded. Steinberg reflected on the recording process and commented that: ...|$|E

[...] "On one hand, it surprises me because Ron has been a far more conventional soap writer than I was, [...] "Malone stated. [...] "He’s also a great lover of the form, and {{has worked in the}} form for a long time. Ron loves the conventions and traditions of the form. So, <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>reaction</b> is, I’m surprised." [...] Malone said that the character (Marty) having amnesia [...] "literally erases the real moral consequences and the real spiritual journey Marty has embarked on. It’s like telling Othello he’s White and Desdemona doesn’t really die. Presumably, Marty will gain her memory, and what will happen? She will be horrified". Malone agreed that Todd had now [...] "raped Marty in the worst possible way" [...] but that this type of story [...] coming out of nowhere". [...] "In this genre, General Hospitals Luke and Laura have a long history. This kind of story is profoundly founded on hope, forgiveness and redemption," [...] he said. [...] "That’s why it goes to its most radical narrative position. That someone can forgive this ultimate crime is redemptive both for the person forgiven, and the forgiver." [...] Malone said he had faith in Carlivati's storytelling but that the story would have been different and possibly not romantic if he himself had been writing it. [...] "Anyone can tell a story, {{and one of the reasons}} people mock soaps is because you can only read plot," [...] he said. [...] "Writing a story is about the depths of the character and the relationships of the character, and the beauty in which the story is told." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{his success}} with Lonely Are the Brave and , Goldsmith {{went on to}} achieve even more {{critical}} recognition with the theme music to The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (1964), and scores to such films as the 1964 western Rio Conchos, the 1964 political thriller Seven Days in May, the 1965 romantic drama A Patch of Blue, the 1965 epic war film In Harm's Way (in which Goldsmith also made a brief cameo appearance), the 1966 World War I air combat film The Blue Max, the 1966 period naval war epic The Sand Pebbles, the 1967 thriller Warning Shot, the 1967 western Hour of the Gun, and the 1968 controversial mystery The Detective. [...] His score for The Blue Max is regarded by many Goldsmith aficionados {{as one of the}} very best scores he wrote during his long and distinguished career. Interestingly, he almost didn't accept the assignment when he watched the final cut with the producers who had temp-tracked it with Richard Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra. He said, [...] "I admit it worked fairly well but <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>reaction</b> was to get up and walk away from the job, but I couldn't. Once you've heard music like that with the picture, it makes your own scoring more difficult to arrive at, it clouds your thinking." [...] Nonetheless, what resulted was breathtaking and the main theme captures the fear and joy of flight many times throughout the film. It is curious that films with significant sequences that involve flight inspired Goldsmith to write some of his most exhilarating music, such as in Supergirl, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, A Gathering of Eagles, Night Crossing, Air Force One and Tora! Tora! Tora!. Goldsmith's scores to A Patch of Blue and The Sand Pebbles garnered him his second and third Academy Award nominations, respectively, and were both one of the 250 nominees for the American Film Institute's top twenty-five American film scores. [...] His scores for Seven Days in May and [...] The Sand Pebbles also garnered Goldsmith his first two respective Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Score in 1965 and 1967. [...] During this time, he also composed for many lighter, comedic films such as the family comedy The Trouble with Angels (1966), the James Bond parodies Our Man Flint (1966) and its sequel In Like Flint (1967), and the comedy The Flim-Flam Man (1967).|$|E

40|$|The {{paper by}} Kobayashi et al. {{triggered}} fond memories and curious questions, {{as one might}} expect when meeting a couple of old, almost forgotten friends. As a post doc in Larry Zipursky's laboratory, I worked in a team trying to understand how Boss/Sevenless signaling directs the presence of one and only one R 7 cell in each ommatidium of the fly eye. Almost 20 years later, an odd sense of ownership contributed to <b>my</b> <b>first</b> knee-jerk <b>reaction</b> to the title of the paper claiming a role for Boss and Sevenless in early male gonads: Those mutants are fertile! How, then, could either Boss or Sevenless be important for the niche in which male germline stem cells reside? But, thinking back, neither boss nor sevenless mutants are blind, and yet they told us a lot about cell fate decisions in the fly visual system. Actually reading the paper, I was drawn into a fascinating story of how, early in the male embryonic gonads, Boss/Sevenless signaling helps in determining the number of somatic niche cells. This decision, much less flexible than one might expect, carries forward into the adult male, where niche size appears to determine the number of germline stem cells. This PaperPick refers to “Boss/Sev Signaling from Germline to Soma Restricts Germline-Stem-Cell-Niche Formation in the Anterior Region of Drosophila Male Gonads,” by Y. Kitadate, S. Shigenobu, K. Arita, and S. Kobayashi, published in July 2007. Video AbstractDrs. Yu Kitadate and Satoru Kobayashi describe their work, building on the original Developmental Cell paper, showing that primordial germ cells use receptor tyrosine kinase ligands to activate a negative feedback mechanism in the embryonic niche. This feedback positions the niche and restricts its size to ensure the appropriate organization and numbers of germline stem cells in the adult fly...|$|R

My second reaction was to ask myself when my essay in Can Governments Learn? was really written and what questions it dealt with; and perhaps even more, what was {{the answer to the question}} which constitutes the title of the book. The need to ask the latter questions had of course something to do with the answer to the first question, namely that the essay was written about 10 years ago. It was therefore obvious that the discussion in this book in a more technical sense had to be updated, but also had to take into account both some new empirical material and the discussion within a couple of intellectual fields. The title of this current paper implies several questions: to what degree politicians and administrators learn from evaluations, and also to what degree learning takes place among the evaluators themselves. These questions create a sort of strategic problem. Am I going to give the answer at the beginning of my paper or perhaps later? But perhaps I will compromise: I will start with a short version of the answer now, but elaborate on the answer later [...] . ...|$|R
