5|$|Chrysler Corporation {{approved}} {{the development of}} the model on the assumption that Chrysler Europe would sell 60,000 C9 models per year, which translated into a projected 5percent share of the executive car <b>market.</b> <b>This</b> estimate seemed achievable because Chrysler had a 7percent market share in Europe overall.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1970s, the new sloggi brand was introduced, {{under which}} {{underwear}} and other products with high cotton content were marketed. The company moved its headquarters from Germany to Switzerland in 1977, and its holding has since been headquartered in Bad Zurzach. By 1986, sales increased to 996 million Swiss francs and the number of employees fell slightly to 19,000 employees. At the same time, sales began in the People's Republic of China and beginning in 1988, individual Triumph products were manufactured under license in East Germany for the local <b>market.</b> <b>This</b> included swimwear in addition to underwear.|$|E

5|$|In the 2002 Nunavut Tourism {{publication}} The Time is Right: A Vision and Strategy for Tourism Development in Nunavut, {{a number}} of issues facing Nunavut tourism operators were highlighted. One major issue for the Nunavut tourism industry is the territory's remote nature. This imposes high travel costs on visitors to Nunavut, and drives tourism numbers down. In addition, Nunavut's position north of the Arctic Circle reduces the opportunity for spring activities, and results in a highly seasonally based tourism <b>market.</b> <b>This</b> limits opportunities for year-round employment in the territory. Many tourism organisations and operators faced difficulty attracting high-quality staff members to their ranks, and experienced high levels of turnover. There are limited links between tourism operators, inhibiting opportunities for inter-sector growth.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Alfonsín {{refused to}} foster {{diplomatic}} relations with the Brazilian military government, and only did so when the dictatorship ended and José Sarney became president. One of their initial concerns was to increase Argentine–Brazilian trade. Both presidents met in Foz do Iguaçu and issued a joint declaration about the peaceful use of nuclear power. A second meeting in Buenos Aires strengthened the trade agreements. Argentina and Brazil signed the Program of Integration and Economic Cooperation (PICE), and in 1988 both countries and Uruguay agreed to create a common <b>market.</b> <b>This</b> led to the 1991 Treaty of Asunción, that created the Mercosur.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Snow Hill tunnel re-opened and {{the former}} LCDR City Branch {{formed the basis of}} the new Thameslink route. Network Rail began a major upgrade of the route in 2009. A key {{objective}} of the Thameslink Programme was allowing more trains to travel between central London and Brighton, which was prevented by a bottleneck between London Bridge and Blackfriars on a viaduct through the historic Borough Market. Network Rail initially suggested widening the viaduct and demolishing part of the market, but the public backlash against this plan prompted Network Rail to consider permanently routing all Thameslink trains to/from Brighton via Herne Hill, avoiding London Bridge and the <b>market.</b> <b>This</b> would have required the grade separation of the two lines through Herne Hill, which would have been achieved by constructing a new viaduct immediately to the east of the existing viaduct and using a fly-over to connect {{the southern end of the}} new viaduct to the line between Tulse Hill and North Dulwich (taking the tracks over the Chatham Main Line and towards Tulse Hill). This proposal was rejected in 2004 because of its environmental impact on Herne Hill and the larger number of interchanges offered on the London Bridge route; the Borough Market viaduct was widened instead. From December 2008 to May 2012, Thameslink trains serving Herne Hill did not run most weekends or after 22:30 every week-night because of construction work on the Thameslink route through central London as part of the Thameslink Programme.|$|E
5|$|In the {{smelting}} {{process of}} using huge bellows driven by waterwheels, {{massive amounts of}} charcoal {{were used in the}} production process, leading {{to a wide range of}} deforestation in northern China. However, by the end of the 11th century the Chinese discovered that using bituminous coke could replace the role of charcoal, hence many acres of forested land in northern China were spared from the steel and iron industry with this switch of resources. Iron and steel of this period were used to mass-produce ploughs, hammers, needles, pins, nails for ships, musical cymbals, chains for suspension bridges, Buddhist statues, and other routine items for an indigenous mass market. Iron was also a necessary manufacturing component for the production processes of salt and copper. Many newly constructed canals linked the major iron and steel production centers to the capital city's main <b>market.</b> <b>This</b> was also extended to trade with the outside world, which greatly expanded with the high level of Chinese maritime activity abroad during the Southern Song period.|$|E
