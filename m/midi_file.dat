5|$|The {{music in}} Final Fantasy Tactics Advance was {{primarily}} composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, with additional music contributed by Kaori Ohkoshi and Ayako Saso; Nobuo Uematsu provided the main theme. The Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Original Soundtrack album {{was released by}} DigiCube on February 19, 2003. It spans 74 tracks and has a duration of 2:05:27. The first disk includes every song from the game, as it sounds through the Game Boy Advance hardware. The second disk contains fully orchestrated versions of 32 of the same 42 tracks. A new age arrangement album entitled White: Melodies of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, a selection of musical tracks from the game arranged by Yo Yamazaki, Akira Sasaki, and Satoshi Henmi, was released by SME Visual Works on February 26, 2003. White spans 11 tracks and has a duration of 46:10. Within the game, the classical-themed soundtrack is compressed into <b>MIDI</b> <b>file</b> format. Simple sound effects are used during battles, {{and there are no}} voices or speech within the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{instruments}} {{can then}} be played using a pre-recorded <b>MIDI</b> <b>file</b> or via a MIDI controller such as a keyboard. MainStage's other features include the ability to play back pre-recorded backing tracks and {{to function as a}} guitar and vocal multi-effects processor.|$|E

500|$|Communications {{interface}} were {{enhanced with}} Bluetooth device management. Which allowed for Bluetooth file beaming support, Bluetooth headset support {{and support for}} Bluetooth add-on keyboards. A pictures application with viewing, cropping, e-mail, and beaming support was added. Multimedia improvements included <b>MIDI</b> <b>file</b> support as ringtones in Phone Edition and [...] Windows Media Player 9.0 with streaming optimization. A puzzle game titled Jawbreaker is among the preinstalled programs. GAPI was included with this release to facilitate the development of games for the platform.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero World Tour Mobile {{has also}} {{received}} similar praise to its predecessors. Both CNet and IGN {{commented on the}} improvement in sound quality for both low- and high-end phones, with songs being [...] "instantly recognizable" [...] on low-phones, but noted that this quality came with the tradeoff of a larger memory footprint and slow downloads of songs through the cellular networks. However, Pocket Gamer UK noted that on the Java ME version, the songs are only slightly improved over that of a <b>MIDI</b> <b>file.</b> The addition of drums, which is said to effectively double amount of gameplay, and multiplayer to the mobile game was also well received.|$|E
500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Dig My Grave" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} by Parry Gettelman of the Orlando Sentinel as [...] "an angry, fuzzed-out rocker". The vocals for the track were recorded through a guitar fuzz-box in order to distort them. [...] "I Palindrome I", is the final single that was released to promote Apollo 18. [...] The circular nature of the song's lyrical themes is reinforced by its title and use of palindromes. In fact, the song is notable for featuring a word-by-word palindrome in one of the verses: [...] "'Son, I am able', she said, 'though you scare me.' 'Watch', said I. 'Beloved", I said, 'watch me scare you, though.' Said she, 'Able am I, son.'" [...] "She's Actual Size" [...] was written by Flansburgh after he contemplated the imagery of someone viewing a departing person in a mirror; he felt that the symbolism was a [...] "really succinct way of talking about leaving somebody behind". The band later expressed disappointment with the [...] "definitive" [...] version featured on this album, largely because the song continued to develop as the band played it live. Flansburgh called the album version [...] "timid" [...] and noted that [...] "later performance versions of [...] have so much more spirit than the recorded version." [...] Although Linnell and Flansburgh usually write songs individually, [...] "My Evil Twin" [...] was an example of the two collaborating. Linnell wrote the musical structure of the song, rendering it as a <b>MIDI</b> <b>file,</b> and Flansburgh then wrote the melody and the lyrics. [...] "Mammal" [...] discusses various members of the titular vertebrate class, and, according to Linnell, poetically explores the fact that all mammals have hair {{at some point in their}} lifespan. According to Linnell, most of the scientific information in the song was gathered from an encyclopedia.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, several {{companies}} started offering a karaoke service on mobile phones, using a Java MIDlet that runs with a text file containing {{the words and}} a <b>MIDI</b> <b>file</b> with the music. More usual is to contain the lyrics within the same <b>MIDI</b> <b>file.</b> Often the file extension is then changed from [...]mid to [...]kar, both are compatible with the standard for MIDI files.|$|E
2500|$|The General MIDI (GM) {{software}} {{standard was}} devised in 1991 {{to serve as}} a consistent way of describing a set of over 200 sounds (including percussion) available to a PC for playback of musical scores. [...] For the first time, a given MIDI preset consistently produced a specific instrumental sound on any GM-compatible device. The Standard <b>MIDI</b> <b>File</b> (SMF) format (extension [...]mid) combined MIDI events with delta times – a form of time-stamping – and became a popular standard for exchanging music scores between computers. [...] In the case of SMF playback using integrated synthesizers (as in computers and cell phones), the hardware component of the MIDI interface design is often unneeded.|$|E
2500|$|Singing Tesla coil or musical Tesla coil - This is a Tesla coil {{which can}} be played like a musical instrument, with its high voltage {{discharges}} reproducing simple musical tones. The drive current pulses applied to the primary are modulated at an audio rate by a solid state [...] "interrupter" [...] circuit, causing the arc discharge from the high voltage terminal to emit sounds. Only tones and simple chords have been produced so far; the coil cannot function as a loudspeaker, reproducing complex music or voice sounds. The sound output is controlled by a keyboard or <b>MIDI</b> <b>file</b> applied to the circuit through a MIDI interface. Two modulation techniques have been used: AM (amplitude modulation of the exciting voltage) and PFM (pulse-frequency modulation). These are mainly built as novelties for entertainment.|$|E

5000|$|In {{line with}} their policy of using [...]RIFF for all Windows 3.1 [...] "multimedia" [...] files, Microsoft {{introduced}} a new variant on the existing <b>MIDI</b> <b>file</b> format used for storing song information to be played on electronic musical instruments.
