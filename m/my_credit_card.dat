Yet the existing literature has done little to assess the unique contracting problems that those transactions present.

30|$|More {{than half}} of the study {{participants}} also questioned the transfer fees during a disaster. Migrants explained that during disasters information about transaction fees was scattered. Two interviewees cited the Pacific Money website. Others relied on MTOs and banks to be informed about fee cost. Two interviewees mentioned that banks do not always give the fee cost up-front unless asked; instead, this information was found on the receipt. Mobile phone and hand-carried remittances were the least utilized channels. Mobile phones are easy, convenient, and the money is quickly transferred to the receiver. But the channel proved unreliable before a disaster due to connection issues, often becoming completely inoperable during a disaster for the same reason or because of telecommunication breakdown. During disasters, several migrants chose to hand-carry remittances and reported having to take leave of absence from work, forgoing personal and family commitments, sometimes taking out loans {{to cover the cost of}} travel expenses. For example, one interviewee explained: “If we can’t get money to them then my family sends me, I’ll go myself and take the cash. If I have to take a loan out I will.” Another interviewee went on to say, “When a disaster happens and they [family members] need money, I go there with cash and I take <b>my</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> […] I might spend 1000 NZ$, when I go there for a few days it’s even 2000 NZ$ or more.” This information was confirmed during the FGD.|$|E

By Gordon Botting, DrPH, CHES, CFC We sometimes make excuses for our shortcomings and human frailties and this failing can be more prominent in money management than {{in other areas of}} our lifestyle. Two of the most widespread excuses are: I just don’t have the time and I just can’t afford it. Both seem to add validity to our string of lame excuses. Listed below are common examples of excuses: Excuse: I just pay the minimum on <b>my</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> because I can’t pay it in full. Credit card companies just love you when you make this excuse. In fact, this is exactly what they are hoping for as this is the golden goose that they make money on. Making minimum payments barely covers the interest so it puts you farther behind each month and makes you pay forever with interest! According to CNN, the average American household with at least one credit card has approximately $ 16, 000 in debt. If that is true, then the average household is spending $ 2, 000 a year just on interest! Paying an extra $ 100 per month would save you $ 132 in interest annually 1 but what would be much better is to live on plain beans and rice until the credit card is paid in full. Saving that $ 2000 a year for a wonderful vacation or placing it in a mutual fund for a sunny retirement is a far better idea. In plain cold Stewardship is a total lifestyle.

The students, young men and women, are marching at the center, their facial expressions ranging from outrage to stern determination. They wear either the scholar’s long gown or Western-style suits; both kinds of attire identify them as belonging to the social group of “modern” students. And the fact that they indeed embody the forces of modernity, of progress against an essentialized tradition, is made very evident by the painter.

40|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>cards</b> {{have become}} a {{noticeable}} feature on most American households’ financial landscape. Data from the Bank for International Settlements indicate {{that the number of}} <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> in circulation increased 34 percent between 1988 and 1994, and the number of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transactions increased 55 percent. The data also show that the value of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transactions increased 98 percent during the same period. The higher number of cards and their use increased the size of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt, so that total consumer revolving credit outstanding grew from $ 175 billion to $ 339 billion. Unfortunately, aggregate data like those above fail to provide information about the composition of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt growth. So it is impossible to tell whether the increased debt arose from a general {{increase in the number of}} households or from a larger proportion of households with <b>credit</b> <b>cards.</b> Aggregate data also do not reveal who holds <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> balances—upper- or lower-income households—nor do they indicate which factor contributed more to the growth of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt—an increase in the number of households with <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> or an increase in average <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> indebtedness. Such detailed information about the components of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt growth is important because each component has different implications for the viability of the growth of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt.
