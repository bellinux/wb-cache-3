5|$|Müller {{was named}} in Germany's {{provisional}} 27-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup along with seven other Bayern Munich players. Despite suffering a scare {{when he fell}} off his bicycle at the team's training camp in South Tyrol, Müller only received superficial injuries and made the final cut for the tournament when the squad was reduced to 23 players. He was allocated the number 13, normally worn by injured captain Michael Ballack, and previously worn by Müller's eponym Gerd. He earned his second international cap in the final warm-up match before the World Cup when he came on as a half-time substitute for Piotr Trochowski in a 3–1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina. He started {{the first game of}} Germany's World Cup campaign and scored the third goal – his first internationally – in a 4–0 win over Australia, winning Germany's goal of the month award in the process. He played in all Germany's group games, as they finished top of Group D; he scored twice and assisted once in the 4–1 victory over England in the round of 16. In the third minute of Germany's 4–0 quarter final win against Argentina, he opened the scoring with his fourth tournament goal. However, he picked up his second booking of the tournament in the first half, for a handball and was suspended for the semi-final defeat against Spain. Müller said that he felt far <b>more</b> <b>nervous</b> during the Spain game than any he was able to play. He returned to the team for the third-place playoff against Uruguay and scored the first goal, his fifth of the tournament, as Germany won 3–2 to take the bronze medals. The team's success was a culmination of a series of changes made after the national team's failure at Euro 2000. The Germans emphasized a more open, attack-minded style not previously associated with Germany, and included prominent young players, including Müller, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil.|$|E
40|$|The role {{of social}} {{comparison}} of distress {{in the mental}} health help-seeking process remains largely unexplored. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the association of socially compared distress with mental health help-seeking and perceived need for mental health care in a population sample. In 36, 679 adult participants of the 2003 US National Survey on Drug Use and Health, data on 12 -month help-seeking and perceived unmet need for care were compared between participants who described themselves as <b>more</b> worried, <b>nervous</b> or anxious than others vs. participants who described themselves as no <b>more</b> worried, <b>nervous</b> or anxious than others. Compared to participants who described themselves as no <b>more</b> worried, <b>nervous</b> or anxious, than others, those who described themselves as <b>more</b> worried, <b>nervous</b> or anxious were significantly more likely to seek professional help (adjusted odds ratioÂ =Â  1. 84) or to perceive an unmet need for such help (adjusted odds ratioÂ =Â  1. 44). It is concluded that social comparison of distress is a significant correlate of mental health help-seeking and perceived unmet need for such help. Individual variations in social comparison of distress may partly explain the discrepancy between need [...] as measured by non-compared distress [...] and help-seeking in the general population.

25|$|Marianne Vos {{signaled}} {{her presence}} {{right after the}} start, as she attacked during the first kilometer but was caught soon after. The pace was high from the beginning, and the first climb saw some riders struggling already. In front of the peloton, the Polish and Lithuanian riders were setting the pace, as well as Rebecca Much from the United States who was present in front during the whole race. The first lap was completed after {{a bit more than}} 26 minutes, with the peloton still together. Climbing the Torricelle for the second time, the race got a little <b>more</b> <b>nervous</b> with some attacks, but the leading riders from Italy, Germany and East-European countries controlled the pace. Another rider in front was Amanda Spratt from Australia, who closed the gap to a Polish rider's attack. The field slowly diminished in number, as some struggled to keep up and the first riders abandoned. After passing the finish line for the second time, {{at the foot of the}} Torricelle climb, Spratt crashed inside the bunch, but got up quickly again, made it back to the front and even attacked soon after that. The Italian riders were paying attention and pulled her back. Instead, Francesca Andina and Savrina Bernardi escaped, but were caught by the leading bunch under control of the Ukrainian riders. Spratt was relentless in her efforts, but could not create a gap on her own. With two laps to go the Italian Savrina Bernardi set the pace in the climb and the only riders able to follow were Spratt and Ekaterina Tretiakova from Russia, until a chase group of about 15 joined them on the descent. For the final lap, another group of 15 joined them making a field of about 30 riders, half of the peloton, that rode the decisive phase of the race. The Italian and Dutch teams attacked each other on the last climb, but no break attempt was as powerful as the one by Vos. She took off and nobody could follow. Increasing her lead rapidly, it was about 20 seconds on top of the Torricelle climb, and the chase group down the descent had three other Dutch riders in it, not helping it much. Rebecca Much from the United States was leading the group on her own, and during the last kilometres it became apparent that Vos would take her solo to the finish. The other Dutch riders therefore did not hold back any more and managed to place a second rider on the podium, Ellen van Dijk, who crossed the line right after Marta Bastianelli from Italy.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} genetic selection for temperament on the way that stressors affect the behaviour and the adrenal and reproductive axes of sheep. We tested three hypotheses: (i) isolation would increase cortisol secretion and decrease luteinising hormone (LH) secretion <b>more</b> in <b>nervous</b> sheep than in calm sheep; (ii) isolation combined with simulated human presence would increase cortisol secretion and decrease LH secretion <b>more</b> in <b>nervous</b> sheep than in calm sheep and (iii) isolation combined with stressors that were not specific to the selection process (i. e. non-selection stressors) would increase cortisol secretion and decrease LH secretion equally in calm and nervous sheep.

Compared to calm sheep, <b>nervous</b> sheep were <b>more</b> agitated during the first 2 h of isolation but not during the second 2 h of isolation.
