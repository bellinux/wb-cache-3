By the 20th century, New Thought concepts had saturated American popular culture, being common features of both self-help literature and popular psychology.|$|E

Medical records made available in 1991 confirm that Hemingway had been diagnosed with hemochromatosis in early 1961. His sister Ursula and his brother Leicester also killed themselves. In addition to being affected by his physical ailments, Hemingway's health was compromised by his having been a heavy drinker for most of his life.|$|E
5|$|Panpsychism is {{the view}} that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of {{experience}} or point of view. Superficially, {{it seems to be}} a form of property dualism, since it regards everything as having both <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> properties. However, some panpsychists say mechanical behaviour is derived from primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of complex structure in a compound object. So long as the reduction of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not a (strong) form of property dualism; otherwise it is.|$|E
5|$|Phenomenalism is {{the theory}} that {{representations}} (or sense data) of external objects are all that exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by Bertrand Russell {{and many of the}} logical positivists during the early 20th century. A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental. The <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> would then both be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza and was popularized by Ernst Mach in the 19th century. This neutral monism, as it is called, resembles property dualism.|$|E

50|$|In the {{philosophy}} of mind, double-aspect theory is {{the view that the}} <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> the <b>physical</b> are two aspects of, or perspectives on, the same substance. It is also called dual-aspect monism. The theory's relationship to neutral monism is ill-defined, but one proffered distinction says that whereas neutral monism allows the context of a given group of neutral elements to determine whether the group is mental, physical, both, or neither, double-aspect theory requires the <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> the <b>physical</b> to be inseparable and mutually irreducible (though distinct).|$|R

500|$|Dual aspect {{theory or}} dual-aspect monism {{is the view}} that the <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> the <b>physical</b> are two aspects of, or {{perspectives}} on, the same substance. [...] (Thus it is a mixed position, which is monistic in some respects). In modern philosophical writings, the theory's relationship to neutral monism has become somewhat ill-defined, but one proffered distinction says that whereas neutral monism allows the context of a given group of neutral elements and the relationships into which they enter to determine whether the group {{can be thought of as}} mental, physical, both, or neither, dual-aspect theory suggests that the <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> the <b>physical</b> are manifestations (or aspects) of some underlying substance, entity or process that is itself neither mental nor physical as normally understood.

25|$|Davidson {{argued that}} {{anomalous}} monism follows from three plausible theses. Firstly, he assumes {{the denial of}} epiphenomenalism, the denial of the view that mental events do not cause physical events. Secondly, he assumes a nomological view of causation, according to which one event causes another if (and only if) there is a strict, exceptionless law governing {{the relation between the}} events. Thirdly, he assumes the principle of the anomalism of the mental, according to which there are no strict laws that govern the relationship between <b>mental</b> event types <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> event types. By these the theses, Davidson argued, it follows that the causal relations between the <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> the <b>physical</b> hold only between mental event tokens, but mental events as types are anomalous. That ultimately secures token physicalism and a supervenience relation between the <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> the <b>physical,</b> while respecting the autonomy of the mental (Malpas, 2005, §2).|$|R
