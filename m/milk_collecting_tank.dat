40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} whether the binomial temperature/time of 21 ºC for 25 hours, already validated for enumeration of psychrotrophics in milk, presents viability for enumeration of thermoduric psychrotrophic, comparing counts of psychrotrophic and psychrotrophic thermoduric obtained from each binomial of time and temperature of incubation. Twenty-eight refrigerated raw <b>milk</b> samples <b>collected</b> in <b>tank</b> trucks in the reception platform of dairy industries in the northern of Paraná were evaluated. Psychrotrophic and thermoduric psychrotrophic were enumerated at 7 °C for 10 days and at 21 °C for 25 hours. For psychrotrophic, it was observed that there was no significant difference of the counts comparing the two methods of incubation (p = 0. 46), the correlation coefficient between methods was  0. 90 and the linear regression considered satisfactory. For thermoduric psychrotrophic it was not observed significant difference (p = 0. 17) in the counts, however, the correlation coefficient between the two methods was 0. 69 and the linear regression unsatisfactory. It was also observed greater homogeneity in the distribution of the psychrotrophic counts results towards thermoduric  psychrotrophic. The results demonstrate that the numeration of thermoduric psychrotrophic microorganisms by the faster methodology can change the result of the counts, since the coefficient of correlation and linear regression methods are low. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the capacity of Northern Bandung Dairy Farmer Cooperative (KPSBU) to support farmers in producing good quality milk within the milk value chain in West Bandung Regency, West Java. The study used qualitative research strategies including desk study, case study, and focus group discussions. The study compared the involvement of three <b>milk</b> <b>collecting</b> actors that were classified into large cooperative (KPSBU), small cooperative (KUD Puspa Mekar), and private company (Bina Kitri Bersama). A total of 18 dairy farmers, 3 <b>milk</b> <b>collecting</b> actors, 2 <b>milk</b> processors, and one livestock officer were interviewed. Three focus group discussions were conducted. The large cooperative performed better in services, milk collection, and milk quality assessment compared to other <b>milk</b> <b>collecting</b> actors.

The chemical composition as well as physical–chemical and technological parameters of the milk samples have been analyzed experimentally. In addition, the researchers estimated physical, chemical and organoleptic parameters {{as well as the}} yield of the cheese produced from the bulk <b>milk</b> <b>collected</b> from Jersey and Simmental cows. The results of the research proved that the <b>milk</b> samples <b>collected</b> from Jersey and Simmental cows possess the necessary physical–chemical and technological properties and can be used as high-quality raw material for manufacturing brine-ripened (pickled) cheese. The highest content of dry matter, observed in the <b>milk</b> <b>collected</b> from Jersey cows, stemmed from the high contents of fat, protein and minerals. The content of lactose (milk sugar) and physical characteristics (density, freezing temperature) did not vary significantly across the samples. The rennet clots formed in the <b>milk</b> <b>collected</b> from Jersey cows were characterized by higher structural–mechanical parameters and syneresis. Jersey milk possesses the qualitative characteristics that best contribute to high cheese yield, which allows for the most efficient cheese production. Cheese manufactured from Jersey milk is distinguished by less water content, higher fat and protein contents and higher organoleptic indicators, which all together improve the quality of cheese turning it into a highly competitive product...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of albendazole (ABZ) {{and its main}} metabolites albendazole sulphoxide (ABZSO), albendazole sulphone (ABZSO(2)) and albendazole 2 -aminosulphone (NH(2) ABZSO(2)) were investigated in bulk milk and milk products after administration of a single oral dose of the drug (12. 5 mg/kg) to 80 Laticauda sheep. An analytical method was developed for this investigation from an existing procedure used for the determination of these compounds in plasma and digesta samples. No traces of the parent compound or NH(2) ABZSO(2) were found in milk or milk products, {{with the exception of}} the <b>milk</b> <b>collected</b> 36 h after treatment in which 89 mu g NH(2) ABZSO(2) /kg was detected. Results indicated that ABZ was rapidly oxidized to ABZSO and then to ABZSO(2). These metabolites were found at high levels (1 - 4 mg/kg) in <b>milk</b> <b>collected</b> within 24 h after treatment. Products derived from such milk also contained high concentrations of the two oxidized metabolites, including up to 5 mg ABZSO/kg in Pecorino cheese. Only small quantities of these two metabolites were found in <b>milk</b> <b>collected</b> during the second day after treatment (range 50 - 500 mu g/kg). They were no longer detectable in <b>milk</b> <b>collected</b> during the third day after dosing; nor were they found in products made from such milli. These findings confirm that the two polar metabolites ABZSO and ABZSO(2) were efficiently excreted from the body. Considering that the established maximum residue limit for ovine milk is 100 mu g/kg for ABZ plus its metabolites, our results confirmed the appropriateness of the currently prescribed withdrawal time (3 d) after the use of ABZ in lactating sheep. However, considerable levels of ABZSO were detected in <b>milk</b> <b>collected</b> within 24 h after treatment as well as in products and by-products derived from such milk.

40|$|Background: Marsupials {{such as the}} tammar wallaby (M. Eugenii) have a short {{gestation}} (29. 3 days) and {{at birth}} the altricial young resembles a fetus, and the major development occurs postnatally while the young remains in the mother 2 ̆ 7 s pouch. The essential functional factors for the maturation of the neonate are provided by the milk which changes in composition progressively throughout lactation (300 days). Morphologically the lungs of tammar pouch young are immature at birth {{and the majority of}} their development occurs during the first 100 days of lactation. Results: In this study mouse embryonic lungs (E- 12) were cultured in media with tammar skim <b>milk</b> <b>collected</b> at key time points of lactation to identify factors involved in regulating postnatal lung maturation. Remarkably the embryonic lungs showed increased branching morphogenesis and this effect was restricted to <b>milk</b> <b>collected</b> at specific time points between approximately day 40 to 100 lactation. Further analysis to assess lung development showed {{a significant increase in the}} expression of marker genes Sp-C, Sp-B, Wnt- 7 b, BMP 4 and Id 2 in lung cultures incubated with <b>milk</b> <b>collected</b> at day 60. Similarly, day 60 milk specifically stimulated proliferation and elongation of lung mesenchymal cells that invaded matrigel. In addition, this milk stimulated proliferation of lung epithelium cells on matrigel, and the cells formed 3 -dimensional acini with an extended lumen. Conclusions: This study has clearly demonstrated that tammar wallaby <b>milk</b> <b>collected</b> at specific times in early lactation contains bioactives that may have a significant role in lung maturation of pouch young...|$|R

Ninety-six raw milk samples (84 composite samples and 12 bulk samples) were <b>collected</b> from Garmsar <b>milk</b> <b>collecting</b> center. Raw <b>milk</b> samples were transferred to laboratory in safe conditions. After serial dilution, the appropriate concentrations (10 - 2 to 10 - 6) were cultured on Baired- Parker agar medium. The plates were incubated at 37 oC for 2 days (48 h). After 48 hours' incubation, the colonies with black centers and light areas were used for staphylococcal assay. The coagulase test was done with rabbit plasma and coagulate- positive colonies were then counted. The results showed that mean counts of coagulate-positive Staphylococcus aureus in composite and bulk milk were 5. 4 × 10 5 cfu/ml and 3. 2 × 105 cfu/ml, respectively. The counts ranged from 8. 6 × 10 4 to 2. 1 × 10 6 cfu/ml and 1. 4 × 10 5 to 5. 5 × 10 5 cfu/ ml. The standard deviations were 3. 5 × 10 5 cfu/ml and 1. 4 × 10 5 cfu/ml respectively.
