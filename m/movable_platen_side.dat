This paper presents a new design of a tiebarless clamping system for micro-{{injection molding}} machine. The tiebarless clamping system can provide lots of convenience, such as more mold space for automation etc., for a micro-injection molding machine. Good parallel precision between stationary <b>platen</b> and <b>movable</b> <b>platen</b> of a clamping system is an important feature for high precision injection molding. With special mechanism of this tiebarless clamping system, the <b>movable</b> <b>platen</b> will deform with the stationary platen synchronously under high clamping force to maintain the parallelism. Via tests and verifications, the parallel precision is controlled at good condition under 6 tons of clamping force...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model-free robust/adaptive control scheme for tracking control of electro-hydraulic servo systems using output feedback only. The Taylor expansion theory {{is used to}} enable the proposed controller to identify and feedback linearize the dynamics of a system on-line, and to compensate parameter variation and various disturbances in real time. As a result, the closed-loop system of the complicated electrohydraulic system behaves as a simple linear dominated system plus a small uncertainty residual. By properly designing the adaptive law of the robust gain, asymptotic stability and satisfactory performance of the closed-loop system can be achieved. The details of controller design and stability analysis are presented in the paper. The controller has been implemented on a plastic injection molding machine to control {{the position of the}} mold-supporting <b>movable</b> <b>platen.</b> The results from experiments indicate that the proposed controller performs much better than the conventional PID feedback controller...|$|R
500|$|Two dies {{are used}} in die casting; one is called the [...] "cover die half" [...] and the other the [...] "ejector die half". Where they meet is called the parting line. The cover die {{contains}} the sprue (for hot-chamber machines) or shot hole (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner, which is the path from the sprue or shot hole to the mold cavity. The cover die is secured to the stationary, or front, platen of the casting machine, while the ejector die {{is attached to the}} <b>movable</b> <b>platen.</b> The mold cavity is cut into two cavity inserts, which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves.|$|R
40|$|Plastic are {{certainly}} most versatile of all known materials today and have therefore, established themselves in enviable position from where {{are not even}} possible to replaced. Injection molding machine {{is one of the}} most widely used method of conversion of plastic into various end products application to wide range of plastic materials from plastic commodity to specialty engineering plastic. In injection molding machine stationary platen play a very important role. During the process generally compressive stress generates at particular regions. As load varies with fast rate there is chance to failure of tie bar rod. Due to heavy mould shape, size of platen also change, that’s increase its weight as well as stress level at certain region and this is not good in practice. This leads to failure of platen or failure of tie rod due to stretching by nut and platen. This create loss of money (Production stop), man (injured due to accident), and material (increase inventory cost). The aim of this project is study about those areas where stress can affect the failure of tie bar due to heavy weight of stationary platen the deflection or misalignment with <b>movable</b> <b>platen.</b> Finally redistribution of stress sothat uniforme stress achive (optimization of platen). This project is including Finite Element Analysis and Design Optimization of a Typical Structural Component of a Plastic Injection Molding Machine. The aim of project is to optimize a typical structural component (stationary platen) by using finite element analysis after checking induced stresses with allowable design stress. Hence design modification of platen is carried out to achieve good strength and cost effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|This paper deals with, the {{solution}} of problem occurred for reciprocating screw of Injection molding machine. It identifies and solves the problem by using the modeling and simulation techniques. The problem occurred in the reciprocating screw of machine which was wearing of threads due to affect of temperature of mold materials (flow materials) i. e. Nylon, low density polypropylene, polystyrene, PVC etc., The main work was to model the components of machine with dimensions, assemble those components and then simulate the whole assembly for rotation of the screw. The modeling software used is PRO-E wildfire 4. 0 for modeling the machine components like body, <b>movable</b> <b>platen,</b> fixed platen, barrel, screw, nozzle, etc. The analysis software ANSYS is {{used to analyze the}} reciprocating screws. The objectives involved are:-• To model all the components using modeling software Pro-E 4. 0 • To assemble all the components of the machine in the software. • To make the assembly run in Pro-E software. • Analysis of screw of machine using Ansys 11. 0 software. • To identify the wearing of threads and to provide the possible solutions. This problem is major for all industrial injection molding machines which the industries are facing and they need the permanent solution, so if the better solution is achieved then the industries will think for implementing it. The industries are having temporary solution but it will affect the life of the screw, because the stresses will be more in machined screw on lathe machine as compared to normal screw. Also if the screw will fail after some years of operation, the new screw available in the market will have the same problem. Also the cost associated with new screw and its mounting is much more as it is the main component of machine...|$|R
40|$|Rectangular thick {{sections}} (1 cm thickness) of lab-grown monocrystalline ice {{have been}} confined between two thick Plexiglas plates and crushed at - 10 C from one edge face {{at a rate}} of 1 cm/s using a transparent Plexiglas platen (1 cm thickness) inserted between the plates. The transparent plates and <b>platen</b> permitted <b>side</b> viewing of the ice behavior during crushing using high-speed video and also a top view of the ice/platen contact zone through the crushing platen using regular video. Zones of intact ice at the ice/platen interface were evident in the visual records and these were shaped by cracks and spalls. The production and flow of liquid in a thin layer at the intact ice/platen interface was also evident. A novel method was used to obtain pressure measurements at the ice/platen interface. Pressure values for the intact ice contact zones were high (at least 20 MPa) and for the crushed ice the pressure varied from low (1 MPa) to high values (20 MPa) depending on its thickness over intact ice. Also, wetting from liquid produced at the intact ice/ platen interface probably softened and reduced the pressure in pulverized ice. Features of the load and pressure data are discussed {{in the context of the}} visual observations. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Small scale {{laboratory}} experiments, {{in which}} the specimen is considered to represent an element of soil in the soil mass, {{are essential to the}} evolution of fundamental theories of mechanical behaviour. In this thesis, plane strain and axisymmetric compression tests, performed on a fine sand, are reported and the results are compared with various theoretical predictions. A new apparatus is described in which cuboidal samples can be tested in either axisymmetric compression or plane strain. The plane strain condition is simulated either by rigid <b>side</b> <b>platens,</b> in the conventional manner, or by flexible <b>side</b> <b>platens</b> which also measure the intermediate principal stress. Close control of the initial porosity of the specimens is achieved by a vibratory method of sample preparation. The strength of sand is higher in plane strain than in axisymmetric compression, and the strains required to mobilize peak strength are much smaller. The difference between plane strain and axisymmetric compression behaviour is attributed to the restrictions on particle movement enforced by the plane strain condition; this results in an increase in the frictional component of shear strength. The stress conditions at failure in plane strain, including the intermediate principal stress, are accurately predicted by a theory based on the stress- dilatancy interpretation of Mohr's circles. Detailed observations of rupture modes are presented and measured rupture plane inclinations are predicted by the stress-dilatancy theory. Although good correlation with the stress-dilatancy theory is obtained during virgin loading, in both axisymmetric compression and plane strain, the stress-dilatancy rule is only obeyed during reloading if the specimen has been unloaded to approximate ambient stress conditions. The shape of the stress-strain curves during pre-peak deformation, in both plane strain and axisymmetric compression, is accurately described bv a combined parabolic-hyperbolic specification...|$|R
40|$|In {{an event}} of a {{rollover}} of any vehicle, there are fatal injuries to the driver and passenger. Regulation & standards for FMVSS 216 and ECE R 29 takes into the tests the cabin for roof strength. The roof strength is done is two ways either by quasi static or dynamic. This dissertation focuses on the rollover phenomenon by the quasi static approach. There is very little difference in results between quasi static and dynamic rollover. An un laden truck is used to simulate the rollover. A <b>side</b> <b>platen</b> is impacted to simulate the phase- 1 of the rollover. Energy depending on {{the mass of the}} vehicle is imparted in phase- 1. Phase I will end once this energy is completely absorbed by the cab. The phase- 1, the cab mounts play an important role as the complete load is transferred to the frame. the cab mounts has a tendency to fail in this phase. In phase II the truck axle weight is given the load to the cab. Per FMVSS 216 and ECE R 29 the load is ramped to 105 % of the actual load. A 50 th percentile dummy is used to check the intrusion of the cab into the survival space. Force versus displacement is plotted to analyze the strength of the cab. Energy plots will the component which has absorbed the maximum energy. The strain plots of the roof, back panel, floor, cab mounts are plotted and analyzed. After this whole exercise the cab is predicted to pass FMVSS 216 or ECE R 29 to have enough strength to withstand a rollover...|$|R
