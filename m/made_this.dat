5|$|Meanwhile, Ptolemy III of Egypt, who {{had been}} an ally of the Achaean League in their wars against Macedon, shifted his {{financial}} support to Sparta.

5|$|The {{development}} of effective time-delay shells {{at the end}} of World War I <b>made</b> <b>this</b> scheme much less effective, as the intact shell would penetrate layers of weak armour and explode deep inside the ship.

5|$|A Confession of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record {{of the actions of}} the Assembly during the writing of the Confession, it is clear that there were {{significant}} debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively <b>made</b> <b>this</b> legislation a nullity.|$|E
5|$|According to John of Wallingford, King Edgar <b>made</b> <b>this</b> {{division}} {{during a}} council at York, {{in order to}} prevent the whole area becoming the inheritance of one man.

5|$|After France surrendered, Marcinkus {{managed to}} make his way to the French colonies in Africa (Morocco and Algeria). He decided to go to Great Britain and {{continue}} fighting, but the French army's terms of armistice at Compiègne and tensions between Britain and France <b>made</b> <b>this</b> difficult. On 12 August 1940 he was finally demobilized from the French army. Marcinkus and some of his associates concocted a daring plan to commandeer several aircraft without authorization and fly to England. The plan was not executed due to increased security at airfields and other circumstances. He finally received the necessary documents enabling him to go to Britain in autumn of 1940.|$|E
5|$|After the Wujing Zongyao of 1510 was printed, other Ming copies were <b>made.</b> <b>This</b> {{included}} the Jiajing edition (1522–1566 AD), the Wanli edition (1573–1619 AD) of Quanzhou, and the Wanli edition (1573–1619) of Jinling by Tang Xinyün (preserved by Cunjingge). During the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911 AD) {{it was also}} reprinted in two different editions during the 18th century, and again in 1934 with the Shanghai edition.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Godsal {{intended}} to swing Vindictive broadside {{on into the}} channel mouth, but as he ordered the turn, the right screw broke down completely, preventing the cruiser from fully turning. Before this was realised on the cruiser's bridge, a shell fired from a gun battery on shore struck Commander Godsal directly, killing him instantly and shattering the bridge structure. Most of the bridge crew were killed or wounded by the blast, including First Lieutenant Victor Crutchley, who staggered to the wheel and attempted to force the ship to make the full turn into the channel. The damaged propeller <b>made</b> <b>this</b> maneuver impossible and the drifting cruiser floated out of the channel and became stuck on a sandbank outside, only partially obscuring the entranceway.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the term}} lipid is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym for fats, fats are a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides. Lipids also encompass molecules such as fatty acids and their derivatives (including tri-, di-, monoglycerides, and phospholipids), {{as well as other}} sterol-containing metabolites such as cholesterol. Although humans and other mammals use various biosynthetic pathways both to break down and to synthesize lipids, some essential lipids cannot be <b>made</b> <b>this</b> way and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} three-mile {{section of}} Illinois 22 from Illinois 83 to Milwaukee Avenue, primarily located in Buffalo Grove, was another closely related project {{that was once}} again met with similar delays and concerns. Long Grove got on board in May 2005 and approved any widening between its eastern city limits and Illinois 83. Roadwork began in the fall on the two-year project, and in September 2007 it was finished; complete with four concrete lanes and a center grassy median. Again, intersection improvements were also <b>made,</b> <b>this</b> time adding dual left turn lanes to both east–west approaches at Illinois 83 and Buffalo Grove Road.|$|E
5|$|Animals bolstered morale at the front, {{due to the}} soldiers' {{affection for}} them. Some {{recruitment}} posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses {{could also be a}} health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because of the difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt. Horse manure was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Manure was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often <b>made</b> <b>this</b> impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.|$|E
