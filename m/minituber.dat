40|$|The {{effects of}} a post-harvest {{application}} of gibberellic acid (GA 3) at various concentrations (0, 10, 25, 50, or 100 mg l- 1) and for different periods of incubation (1, 2, or 3 h) on the breaking of dormancy and on sprouting in potato (Solanum tuberosum L., cv. Marfona) <b>minitubers</b> of two ages (freshly-harvested or 1 week after harvest) were investigated. Compared with untreated, control <b>minitubers,</b> GA 3 -treated <b>minitubers</b> showed a significantly shorter period of dormancy (46 d), especially when the <b>minitubers</b> were treated at all concentrations immediately after harvest (41 d). GA 3 treatment had a greater effect on dormancy in freshly-harvested <b>minitubers</b> than in 1 week-old <b>minitubers,</b> probably because of the reduced uptake of GA 3 solution after skin-set. At lower concentrations of GA 3, the period of dormancy tended to decrease the longer the <b>minitubers</b> were immersed in the GA 3 solution. In contrast, at higher concentrations of GA 3, the duration of immersion only had an effect up to 2 h and any longer immersion was ineffective. The average number of sprouts was not affected by GA 3 concentration, or {{by the time of}} incubation, but was significantly higher for freshly-harvested <b>minitubers</b> (1. 4) than for 1 week-old <b>minitubers</b> (1. 2). The lengths of the sprouts increased with an increase in GA 3 concentration, especially in freshly-harvested <b>minitubers.</b> Consequently, immersing freshly-harvested potato <b>minitubers</b> in a low concentration of GA 3 (up to 25 mg l- 1) for up to 3 h effectively shortened the period of dormancy and {{led to the formation of}} sprouts of optimum lengt...|$|R
40|$|A two-year {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} (1) jasmonic acid (JA) pre-treatment, (2) JA supplement in culture media, (3) cultivar (Amisk, Atlantic, Russet Burbank, Shepody, and Umatilla Russet), (4) fight (0 h, 8 h), and (5) dormancy breaking treatment (Rindite, gibberellic acid) on greenhouse production of <b>minitubers</b> from microtubers and in vitro plantlets. The microtubers were produced under short day (8 h) fight conditions and in darkness, from stock plantlets pre-treated with JA and untreated, and on tuberization media with or without JA. In vitro plantlets (the industry choice in nuclear seed potato production) of all five cultivars performed well, meeting the standard criteria for greenhouse production of <b>minitubers.</b> Production of <b>minitubers</b> from microtuber-derived plants of cvs Amisk, Russet Burbank, and Umatilla Russet was similar to that of plantlet-derived plants with regard to number of <b>minitubers.</b> Yields (weight), however, were lower than those from plantlets. Microtuber responses to JA varied with cultivar. Amisk produced the highest number of <b>minitubers</b> per plot from microtubers derived from JA pre-treated plantlets. Jasmonic acid-pretreated microtubers also gave significantly more <b>minitubers</b> in Russet Burbank and Umatilla Russet than the microtubers from other treatments. Shepody did not benefit from JA treatments and JA pre-treated Atlantic microtubers performed poorly, producing significantly lower yields of <b>minitubers</b> than other cultivars. Independently of cultivar, microtubers produced under 8 -h photoperiod gave significantly higher yields of <b>minitubers</b> than microtubers produced in the dark. Dormancy release was the key factor influencing microtuber performance. Rindite proved to be a much more effective dormancy breaking treatment than gibberellin. JA conditioning of stock plants prior to tuberization is being proposed as a treatment in production of microtubers for greenhouse production of <b>minitubers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{nutrient}} solution concentration on potato plant growth and <b>minituber</b> yield were determined in a sand closed hydroponic system. Minitubers and micropropagated plantlets of the cv. 'Macaca' were used. Treatments were five nutrient solution concentrations at electrical conductivities (EC) of 1. 0 (T 1), 2. 2 (T 2), 3. 4 (T 3), 4. 7 (T 4) and 5. 8 dS m- 1 (T 5). The split plot randomised experimental design was used with three replications. Plants from minitubers produced higher fresh and mean weight of minitubers, shoot dry mass and leaf area index than the micropropagated ones. However, higher dry mass of minitubers was found with micropropagated plantlets compared to minitubers. The concentration of the nutrient solution did not affect <b>minituber</b> number. Increasing the nutrient solution concentration decreased total and <b>minituber</b> dry mass production of micropropagated plantlets and plant growth and <b>minituber</b> production of minituber-originated plants.

40|$|The obtaining of {{original}} seed of national potato varieties (Solanum tuberosum L.) {{is of great}} importance. The objective of the present work was to obtain <b>minitubers</b> from four national potato varieties in a greenhouse with zeolite as substrate.

On the other hand, {{the potential of}} zeolite {{in the culture of}} different plant species has been demonstrated. Taking in account these aspects, the objective of this research was to produce <b>minitubers</b> of potato cv. 'Desirée' in greenhouse with zeolite as substrate. Plants in rooting stage were transferred directly to the greenhouse. Then a field experiment to compare the results was carried out simultaneously. Plants came from acclimatization stage after 15 days of culture. Survival, fresh mass and number of <b>minitubers</b> per plant were determined. Besides, losses were quantified since the transfer until harvest. The effect of plant height and distance of planting on crop yield were determined. <b>Minitubers</b> produced in both conditions were kept in cold storage for eight months and then the results were compared. Besides, the <b>minitubers</b> were planted in field to determine their yield. The results showed {{that it is possible to}} produce <b>minitubers</b> in greenhouse with 100 % zeolite substrate.

The main purpose of this study was to investigate the production of virus free plantlets from meristem culture in two cultivars of potato. The specific objectives was to study genotype (2 commercial cultivars of S. tuberosum, Marophona and Agria), substrate combination including 3 planting bed soil/sand/perlite (1 : 1 : 1), turb/perlite (1 : 1) and turb/rice hull/perlite (1 : 1 : 1), pot size with 19 cm (large) and 13 cm (small) diameters and their interactions on number and total weight of minitubers. A single excised meristem tip was carefully placed on the filter paper bridge of the culture tubes containing MS liquid and then semisolid medium. The virus-free plantlets were transferred to pots with above mentioned substrates and pots. Statistical analysis revealed that there are significant differences between potato cultivars, substrates, pots size and substrate × pot size interaction effects (p< 0. 01). However, there was no significant difference between other interaction effects on number and total weight of <b>minituber.</b> The Marophona cv. with 9 minituber/pot and 65 gr/plant averages was better than from Agria cv. with 7 minituber/pot and 57 gr/plant averages for number and total weight of minituber,respectively.

40|$|Effects of {{treatments}} with gibberellic acid (GA(3), 50 mg L- 1 for 2 h) or carbon disulphide (CS 2, 25 ml m(- 3) for four days) on breaking of dormancy and sprouting of potato (Solanum tuberosum L., cvs Agria and Marfona) minitubers of different weight classes (0. 3, 0. 7 and 1. 5 g) were investigated. The dormancy period tended to decrease {{with an increase}} in the weight of minitubers, whereas the number of sprouts per <b>minituber,</b> their length and fresh weight and the sprout mass per unit of sprout length of the longest sprout tended to increase {{with an increase in}} <b>minituber</b> weight. In both cultivars, applying GA(3) or CS 2 advanced breaking of dormancy, but GA(3) was less effective in Marfona than in Agria. Advancing breaking of dormancy was associated with removal of apical dominance and therefore applying GA(3) or CS 2 also increased the number of sprouts per <b>minituber,</b> especially in Agria. In Agria, the dry matter content of sprouts from the CS 2 treatment was higher than in the GA(3) or control treatments, whereas in Marfona dry matter content of sprouts was highest in the GA(3) treatment. The length of sprouts, fresh weight of sprouts and the sprout mass per unit of sprout length of the longest sprout were significantly enhanced by treating minitubers with GA(3) or CS 2 compared with the untreated control minitubers, but there were strong interactions with cultivar and <b>minituber</b> weight.

This study investigated by which mechanisms planting density (25. 0, 62. 5 and 145. 8 plants/m 2) of in vitro derived plantlets affected <b>minituber</b> yield and <b>minituber</b> number per plantlet. Lowering planting density {{resulted in a}} slower increase in soil cover by the leaves and reduced the accumulated intercepted radiation (AIR). It initially also reduced light use efficiency (LUE) and harvest index, and thus tuber weights per m 2. At the commercial harvest 10 weeks after planting (WAP), LUE tended to be higher at lower densities. This compensated for the lower AIR and led to only slightly lower tuber yields. Lowering planting density increased tuber numbers per (planted) plantlet in all grades. It improved plantlet survival and increased stem numbers per plant. However, fewer stolons were produced per stem, whereas stolon numbers per plant were not affected. At lower densities, more tubers were initiated per stolon and the balance between initiation and later resorption of tubers was more favourable. Early interplant competition was thought {{to reduce the number}} of tubers initiated at higher densities, whereas later-occurring interplant competition resulted in a large fraction of the initiated tubers being resorbed at intermediate planting densities. At low planting densities, the high number of tubers initiated was also retained.

The type of planting material did not influence the number of tubers per plant at 36 weeks of field crop but in its fresh weight. Minitubers with higher fresh weight than 26. 0 g produced the highest percentage of sprout and fresh weight of minitubers per plant. It was demonstrated that <b>minituber</b> can be used for direct field planting and the agronomic response of plants is higher than the in vitro plants.

40|$|Scarcity of {{good quality}} seed is major {{obstacle}} to expanded potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production in sub-saharan Africa (SSA). Constraints in availability and supply of seed potato are partly attributable to challenges in production of pre-basic which is an intermediary step necessary in production of seed tubers in the seed potato value chain. Aeroponic minutuber production is a relatively recent technology {{that has the potential}} to break the seed potato bottleneck in many SSA countries due to several advantages that it holds especially those related to high multiplication rates; typically (1 : 50 - 100) that arise from sequential harvesting. There are, however, a number of potential challenges which, if not addressed, can contribute to non attainment of the projected increases in seed availability and not only mess up the 3 generation (3 G) revolution strategy of boosting seed tuber production in SSA but also jeopardize the adoption of the technology. Besides problems associated with failure of electricity supply and management of nutrition, the Achilles‘ heel of aeroponic <b>minituber</b> production is probably the large variation in physiological age of resulting tubers due to sequential harvesting that takes place over several months during the production cycle. In the absence of cold storage facilities which are few and beyond the reach of many pre-basic seed potato growers in many SSA countries, harvested minitubers can either be at dormant, apical dominance, multiple sprouting or senile stage when they are required for planting with significant impacts on subsequent yields. This paper discusses the problems associated with physiological age in seed tuber systems based on aeroponic minitubers and proposes some approaches that may overcome these challenges to ensure that the promise of aeroponic <b>minituber</b> production is realized. The proposed approaches include the strategic application of dormancy inhibiting and dormancy promoting substances at various stages of aeroponic <b>minituber</b> production combined with the use of low cost storage systems such as the diffused light storage technology depending on the dormancy period of the variety (ies) being grown.

40|$|The {{plantation}} {{of potato}} in vitro plants in greenhouse present some problems. Mainly the low uniformity of growing populations, the low and irregular yield {{and the low}} quality of the <b>minitubers.</b> The Chitosan is an elicitor used in the farm for increasing the yield of the potatoes plantations. The application to different concentrations of this elicitor in the in vitro rooting stage and its effect {{in the production of}} the <b>minitubers</b> in greenhouse were evaluated in the present work. Chitosan was added in culture semisolid medium in concentrations of 0. 01, 0. 1, 1, 10, 100 g. l- 1 and the influence in the production of <b>minitubers</b> in greenhouse was evaluated. The elicitor produced fitotoxicity on plants in concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 g. l- 1; the length and fresh weight of plants decreased.

40|$|Considering {{the limited}} {{availability}} of planting material in yam cv. `White Guinea' (Dioscorea rotundata Point), mainly {{due to the}} tubers that are consumed are used as seed, have been developed methods for its micropropagation. However, field survival of the plants is very low, so the search of alternatives, among then, the production of <b>minitubers,</b> are necessaries. This work aimed {{to determine the effect}} of planting distance of the in vitro plants in green house on <b>minitubers</b> production. Four planting distances of in vitro plants (0. 05 x 0. 05 m, 0. 10 x 0. 10 m, 0. 15 x 0. 15 m, 0. 20 x 0. 20 m) were studied. In each treatment was determined: number of <b>minitubers,</b> fresh mass of tubers per plant and its category as planting material. The highest values of number of tubers per plant (3. 83 and 3. 12) were obtained with the distance x 0. 10 0. 10 x 0. 15 m and 0. 15 m, respectively. With the planting distance of 0. 10 x 0. 10 m, the higher numbers of <b>minitubers</b> per square meter were achieved: 100, 110 and 90 in the categories with a fresh mass between 16. 0 to 25. 9 g, 26. 0 to 35. 9 g, 36. 0 to 50. 0 g (26. 10 %, 28. 72 % and 23. 49 %, respectively).

In comparison with the control minitubers, CS 2 treated minitubers showed significantly shorter dormancy and better sprouting. More rotting and weaker responses were observed in freshly harvested treated minitubers compared with minitubers treated one week after harvest. The number of sprouts per <b>minituber</b> and their length were significantly enhanced by treating minitubers with CS 2 compared with the untreated control minitubers, but there were strong interactions with <b>minituber</b> weight. Results showed that duration of CS 2 treatment {{was more important than}} concentration and longer duration of CS 2 treatment exhibited a stronger action on breaking dormancy and sprouting of potato minitubers than shorter treatments.

The results showed that fresh weight of shoot and roots, and potato plant height was significantly higher in aeroponics compared to classic hydroponics. The highest shoot and root fresh weight in aeroponics was observed in Moren cultivar, nourished with commercial nutrient solution of Isfahan. Plant height was the highest in Moren cultivar, APCoAB nutrient solution and aeroponic system. The lowest shoot and root fresh weight and plant height were observed in Marfona cultivar. Yield and number of minitubers per plant in aeroponics increased 58. 08 and 277. 2 percent compared to hydroponics, respectively. The highest yield and number of minitubers was obtained in aeroponics system, APCoAB nutrient solution and Marfona cultivar.

40|$|Microtubers can {{be easily}} induced in vitro, however so far their small size and low yield have {{restricted}} their use as propagules. Temporary immersion systems were used to produce potato microtubers {{and the effect of}} culture parameters as inoculum density and time of immersion on microtuberization were studied. When the inoculum density was increased from 60 to 90 explants per TIS no differences were observed regarding the number of microtubers per plant. However, fresh weight of the microtubers was superior with 60 explants (164. 70 g) compared with 47 g obtained with 90 explants per TIS and the diameter of microtubers was affected adversely too. Immersion times of 2 minutes increased the number of microtubers per plant, as well as their size and quality, compared to immersion times of 30 minutes. In field studies plants derived from microtubers produced minitubers with higher diameter and fresh weight than plantlets from in vitro culture, with <b>minituber</b> numbers per plant similar in both treatments.

Hydroponic systems increase the production of virus-free potato <b>minitubers.</b> This research was carried out to study the effect of different growth media on number of <b>minitubers</b> and concentration of elements in potato shoot and root and also to compare the hydroponic culture and soil containing media in a randomized complete blocks design with 8 treatments and 4 replications. The treatments consisted of: 1) perlite, 2) perlite + vermiculite (1 : 1 v/v), 3) perlite + peat moss (1 : 1 v/v), 4) perlite + soil (1 : 1 v/v), 5) perlite + soil + compost (40 : 30 : 30), 6) perlite + soil + vermicompost (40 : 30 : 30), 7) soil, and 8) perlite + peat moss (control). At the end of growth period, the number of tuber per plant and concentration of elements (N, P, K, Na, and Ca) in roots and shoots were measured. Results of analysis of variance showed that bulk density, particle density, porosity, EC and pH of different growth media were significantly different (P< 0. 01). The soil medium had the highest bulk density (1. 23 g/cm 3), the highest particle density (2. 44 g/cm 3), the highest EC and pH and the lowest porosity (50 %). Therefore, this treatment produced the lowest number of tubers per pot. The maximum concentration of N, P and K in potato shoot and root were in perlite + soil + vermicompost and soil + compost + perlite media. The maximum concentration of Ca in potato shoot was in perlite + soil medium (1. 68 mg/g dw). The maximum concentration of Na in potato shoot was in soil + compost + perlite medium (0. 35 mg/g dw).
