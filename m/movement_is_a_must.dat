This {{collection}} of essays casts new light on this history showing in more detail how the boundaries between marxism and anarchism have been more porous and more productive than is conventionally recognized. Bringing together original and ground-breaking pieces {{on some of the}} best and least known actors in twentieth-century socialism, this book promises to break new ground by providing a fresh outlook on left wing synthesis in the twenty-first Century. The political and social thought of Gramsci, Sorel, and the Trinidadian, C. L. R. James, amongst others, are discussed alongside key movements in 20 th century socialism including the Situationist International, Socialisme ou Barbarie and lesser known council communists, carnival anarchists and anarchic currents in the American civil rights <b>movement.</b> This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>must</b> read for students and scholars interested in the development of socialist ideologies...|$|R
