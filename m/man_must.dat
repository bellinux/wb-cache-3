5|$|A platform-action game, Mega Man 3 {{follows the}} same format {{set forth by}} its two predecessors. The player, as Mega <b>Man,</b> <b>must</b> {{complete}} a series of stages in any order. Defeating a stage's boss will earn the player its special weapon, which can be selected and used at will {{throughout the rest of}} the game. Mega Man 3 introduces new gameplay elements such as Mega Man's canine sidekick Rush and the ability to slide along the ground. Unlike with the first two installments of the series, artist and designer Keiji Inafune has considered the creation of Mega Man 3 to be very stressful due to time constraints and his own increased responsibilities during its development.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{philosophy}} {{divides the}} 613 mitzvot into three groups—laws {{that have a}} rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies (mishpatim), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (edot), and laws {{that do not have}} a rational explanation (chukim). Some Jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as laws {{for which there is no}} particular explanation, since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority, and <b>man</b> <b>must</b> obey without asking why. However, Maimonides believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.|$|E

5|$|The film {{focuses on}} Jack Goodwin, a young {{chemistry}} {{student who has}} discovered a novel compound that allows a person {{to be put in}} a state of sleep for any length of time. The compound causes an effect similar to suspended animation, with no ill-effects or bodily changes. Jack tests the compound on himself for a period of a week and desires to test it for a century. In preparation for this, he obtains a safety deposit vault and provides instructions to be presented before the mayor in a hundred years. Jack's experiment works and he awakes in the year 2010 to a very different future. Transportation has been radically changed to pneumatic tubes allowing him to be transported to the mayor. The woman mayor takes an interest in him and invites her over to her home. In the intervening years, the world has become ruled by women and Jack is now out of place, but the two fall in love. Her father is an advocate for men's rights and Jack joins their society. The group soon appears before the mayor and she sends all of them to jail through the pneumatic tube, except for Jack. She proposes to him, but Jack only consents if the rights of men would be granted. The mayor is true to her word and signs a decree to give the men their liberty. During the ceremony, she attempts to lead Jack to the altar, but Jack shows her that the <b>man</b> <b>must</b> lead. When the bridal veil is placed on Jack, he places it on his new wife.|$|E
