40|$|The report {{describes}} {{the application of}} tools for modelling mechanical components of complex mechatronic systems. Basis is a new, innovative system for describing physical models of multibody systems. The system consists of a description language and a grahpic user interface which supports modelling by 3 D-graphics. The description system permits the implementation of any hierarchical model structure {{as well as the}} definition and utilization of application specific modelling elements. Basing on the model description a new kernel for generating mathematical models has been developed which can be used either as numerical library or as code generation program. Furthermore, it can be directly connected to the grafical user interface which provides enhanced possibilities for the testing of models. For high performance computations (e. g. in real-time <b>mode)</b> <b>a</b> <b>code</b> optimization program generates fast executable code for special parameter sets. The code of the mathematical model can be implemented on any simulation platform (e. g. massively parallel computer) where the connection to other submodels is set up on the level of the mathematical model.

40|$|Application of forward error {{correction}} to recover lost packets in higher layers of communication networks is receiving increasing attention.

By letting l be a multiple of the size of the words of the underlying computer, almost all of the decoding operations are XORs of the computer words.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, <b>a</b> new fast <b>mode</b> {{decision}} (FMD) {{algorithm is}} proposed for the state-of-the-art video coding standard H. 264 /AVC. Firstly, based on Rate-Distortion (RD) cost characteristics, all inter modes are classified into two groups, one is Skip mode (including both Skip and Direct modes) {{and all the other}} inter modes are called non-Skip modes. In order to select the best <b>mode</b> for <b>coding</b> <b>a</b> Macroblock (MB), minimum RD costs of these two mode groups are predicted respectively. Then for Skip <b>mode,</b> <b>an</b> early Skip <b>mode</b> detection scheme is proposed; for non-Skip <b>modes,</b> <b>a</b> three-stage scheme is developed to speed up the mode decision process. Experimental results demonstrate that the pro-posed algorithm has good robustness in coding efficiency with different Quantization parameters (Qps) and various video sequences and is able to achieve about 54 % time saving on average while with negligible degra-dation in Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) and acceptable increase in bit rate...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that drift waves are responsible for {{a large amount of}} transport in fusion experiments and it is of importance to investigate their linear stability and nonlinear evolution. These instabilities have therefore been intensively investigated in tokamaks for the last few decades. The situation is different in stellarators, where they have only received limited attention due to the complicated 3 -dimensional structure and the related high resolution requirements for a numerical treatment. In this thesis <b>a</b> computer <b>code</b> has been developed that calculates necessary magnetic field quantities of any magnetic confinement fusion devices using equilibria obtained from the VMEC code. The code solves the eigenvalue problem using the linear stability of simple i -&# 948; drift model, dissipative two fluid model, and reactive ion-temperature gradient (ITG) instability in the electrostatic limit using the ballooning mode formalism. For all these <b>modes,</b> <b>a</b> shooting <b>code</b> technique is used and WKB type boundary conditions are applied. The equilibria are calculated for, the three-field-period toroidal heliac H 1 -NF, the five-field-period helias Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X), for different aspect ratios of circular tokamak configurations and for the Joint European Torus tokamak (JET). The dependence of the spectrum of stable and unstable modes, on various equilibrium parameters like density gradients, temperature gradients, temperature ratios, wave vectors, normal and geodesic curvature and local magnetic shear are investigated.

40|$|The Author(s) 2016. Human {{touch is}} an {{inherently}} active sense: to estimate an object's shape humans often move their hand across its surface. This way {{the object is}} sampled both in a serial (sampling {{different parts of the}} object across time) and parallel fashion (sampling using different parts of the hand simultaneously). Both the serial (moving a single finger) and parallel (static contact with the entire hand) exploration modes provide reliable and similar global shape information, suggesting the possibility that this information is shared early in the sensory cortex. In contrast, we here show the opposite. Using an adaptation-and-transfer paradigm, a change in haptic perception was induced by slant-adaptation using either the serial or parallel exploration <b>mode.</b> <b>A</b> unified shape-based <b>coding</b> would predict that this would equally affect perception using other exploration modes. However, we found that adaptation-induced perceptual changes did not transfer between exploration modes.
