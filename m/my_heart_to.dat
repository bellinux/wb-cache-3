500|$|Adele [...] is an English {{singer and}} songwriter. After signing a {{contract}} with record label XL Recordings in September 2006, Adele began to work on her debut studio album, 19, which was ultimately released in 2008. At this time, the singer contributed guest vocals on the song [...] "My Yvonne" [...] for Jack Peñate's debut studio album Matinée (2007).

500|$|Cardus's {{interest}} in music {{began with the}} popular tunes sung by his mother and her sisters in the family home. He remembered hearing {{for the first time}} the melody of the [...] "Vilja" [...] song from Franz Lehár's operetta The Merry Widow, which [...] "curled its way into <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> stay there for a lifetime". In April 1907 he was [...] "swept... into the seven seas of music" [...] by a performance of Edward German's operetta Tom Jones. [...] "I am unable to explain", Cardus wrote many years later, [...] "why it should have been left to Edward German—of all composers—to release the flood". He began going to the Hallé Orchestra's concerts at the Free Trade Hall where, on 3 December 1908, he was present at the premiere of Elgar's first symphony, under Hans Richter. He regularly attended the fortnightly concerts at the Royal Manchester College of Music, where students' performances were assessed by the principal, Adolph Brodsky. As part of his scheme of study, Cardus briefly took singing lessons, his only formal instruction in music. In 1912 Cardus published his first musical article, [...] "Bantock and Style in Music", in Musical Opinion.|$|E

Collins, Cash, and Norman {{were unable to}} discern if {{the power of the}} song came from the music or the lyrics. Norman, who once notably sang it {{at the end of a}} large outdoor rock concert for Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday, stated, [...] "I don't know whether it's the text I don't know whether we're talking about the lyrics when we say that it touches so many people or whether it's that tune that everybody knows." [...] A prisoner interviewed by Moyers explained his literal interpretation of the second verse: [...] "'Twas grace that taught <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> fear, and grace my fears relieved" [...] by saying that the fear became immediately real to him when he realized he may never get his life in order, compounded by the loneliness and restriction in prison. Gospel singer Marion Williams summed up its effect: [...] "That's a song that gets to everybody".|$|E
