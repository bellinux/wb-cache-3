5|$|Sylvia Lim was an NCMP from 2006 till Parliament was {{dissolved}} in 2011 {{for the general}} election held that year, at which she was elected {{as one of the}} MPs for Aljunied GRC. While she was an NCMP, Parliament debated the Human Organ Transplant (Amendment) Bill 2009 which would permit an organ donor to receive a reasonable amount of payment as a reimbursement for medical checks, insurance and other medical expenses, and loss of income. Lim spoke of her worry that the bill <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> backdoor organ trading and profiteering.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the Norwegian National Rail Administration {{warned that}} lack of funding <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> closure of all long-distance {{passenger}} trains in Norway, including the Bergen Line. Torild Skogsholm, Minister of Transport and Communications assured {{that it was not}} the government's policy to close railway lines. In 2004 the Progress Party suggested closing down the railway line and replacing it with a motorway between Bergen and Oslo, arguing that the railway was unprofitable, and that bus transport was cheaper while easier truck transport would aid business. Other political parties rejected the proposal pointing out the better environmental performance of the railway and that the railway transports large volumes of freight.|$|E
5|$|Nosanchuk then {{considered}} {{whether or}} not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.|$|E

5|$|Social {{hierarchy}} and tapu (sacred matters) in the Cook Islands {{was controlled by}} ariki (high chiefs), with typically between three and six per island. Each ariki was a ruler of an ivi or ngati (tribe). Lesser noble ranks in the social hierarchy were the mataiapo and rangatira (minor chiefs). The chief's control, which could neither be gained or lost, was established by his mana (power), which derived from his birth, achievements and status. However, an ariki with declining popularity could be perceived to be lacking in mana, which <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> loss of social control.|$|E
5|$|The Crisis {{caused the}} newly {{independent}} African states to reconsider their allegiances and internal ties. In particular, {{it led to the}} division of African states into factions. Moderate-leaning states joined the Brazzaville Group, which called for a degree of unity between Francophone African states and the maintenance of ties with France. Radical states joined the Casablanca Group which called for a Pan-African federation. The chaotic violence of the crisis and the fate of the country's whites, many of whom entered Northern and Southern Rhodesia as refugees, contributed to the widespread belief among whites there that black nationalist politicians were not ready to govern, and prompted fears that immediate majority rule in Rhodesia <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> similar situation. After negotiations with Britain repeatedly broke down, Southern Rhodesia's predominantly white government declared independence unilaterally in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The new viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, {{advanced}} the {{date for the}} transfer of power, believing the continuous contention between the Congress and the Muslim League <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> collapse of the interim government. He chose {{the second anniversary of}} Japan's surrender in World War II, 15 August, as the date of power transfer. The British government announced on 3 June 1947 that it had accepted the idea of partitioning British India into two states; the successor governments would be given dominion status and would have an implicit right to secede from the British Commonwealth. The Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo 6 c. 30) of the Parliament of the United Kingdom partitioned British India into the two new independent dominions of India and Pakistan (including what is now Bangladesh) with effect from 15 August 1947, and granted complete legislative authority upon the respective constituent assemblies of the new countries. The Act received royal assent on 18 July 1947.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{concluded}} that the reform has contributed to improve {{the conditions of the}} price transmission mechanism, by removing some important constraints and freeing variation of domestic sugar prices, eventually starting <b>a</b> process which <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> improved price transmission in the EU sugar sector, if combined with other non-policy developments.|$|R

25|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (the first Chief Rabbi of Palestine) {{and his son}} Zevi Judah, {{began to}} develop the concept of Religious Zionism. Kook was {{concerned}} that growing secularism of Zionist supporters and increasing antagonism towards the movement from the largely non-Zionist Orthodox community <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> schism between them and sought to create a brand of Zionism that {{would serve as a}} bridge between Jewish Orthodoxy and secular Jewish Zionists.|$|E
25|$|After the French Revolution of 1789, Catherine {{rejected}} many {{principles of}} the Enlightenment she had once viewed favourably. Afraid the May Constitution of Poland (1791) <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> resurgence {{in the power of}} the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the growing democratic movements inside the Commonwealth might become a threat to the European monarchies, Catherine decided to intervene in Poland. She provided support to a Polish antireform group known as the Targowica Confederation. After defeating Polish loyalist forces in the Polish–Russian War of 1792 and in the Kościuszko Uprising (1794), Russia completed the partitioning of Poland, dividing all of the remaining Commonwealth territory with Prussia and Austria (1795).|$|E
25|$|After {{the change}} to the {{objective}} pattern of questioning, even the students who initially considered themselves not fit for subjective pattern of IIT-JEE {{decided to take the}} examination. Though the restructuring was meant to reduce the dependence of students on coaching classes, it led to an increase in students registering for coaching classes. Some people (mostly IITians) have criticised the changed pattern of the IIT-JEE. Their reasoning is that while IIT-JEE traditionally used to test students understanding of fundamentals and ability to apply them to solve tough unseen problems, the current pattern does not stress much on the application part and <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> reduced quality of students.|$|E

25|$|While Manstein was formulating new {{plans in}} Koblenz, Generalleutnant Heinz Guderian, {{commander}} of the XIX Army Corps, was lodged in a nearby hotel. Manstein was initially considering a move north from Sedan, directly {{in the rear of}} the main Allied mobile forces in Belgium. When Guderian was invited to contribute to the plan during informal discussions, he proposed a radical and novel idea. Most of the Panzerwaffe should be concentrated at Sedan. This concentration of armour should advance to the west to the English Channel, without waiting for the main body of infantry divisions. This <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> strategic collapse of the enemy, avoiding the relatively high number of casualties normally caused by a Kesselschlacht (cauldron battle).|$|E
25|$|That the {{government}} still displays such heightened sensitivities around the Cultural Revolution is an indicator {{that it still}} considers itself, at least in part, an inheritor of its legacy. The government is apprehensive that academic probing and popular discussions will lead to ideological conflict and increase social instability. It may threaten the foundations of Communist rule. The focus of the Chinese government on maintaining political and social stability has been a top priority since the Tiananmen crackdown on reformers on June 4, 1989, and the current government {{has no interest in}} re-evaluating any issue that <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> split in the Chinese leadership, or which might polarize the Party on ideological grounds.|$|E
25|$|Seven men made up {{the first}} class of students, with a college preparatory {{division}} adding 18 students to the enrollment two months later. In addition to American financing, colleges and individuals from the United States donated books and even the bricks and lumber used to construct the school’s building. At opening, the library had an estimated 4,000 volumes. Once classes opened, the curriculum was the standard courses typical at American colleges with courses such as rhetoric and Latin. Part of the impetus to start the school was a concern that some Liberians were already leaving the nation to study in Great Britain, which American backers thought <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{move away from the}} republican form of government.|$|E

25|$|BBC {{journalist}} Joe Matthews {{published the}} story, on October 13, 2012, behind the 100 tactical nuclear warheads mentioned by Graham Allison in the excerpt above. Khrushchev feared that Castro's hurt pride and widespread Cuban indignation over the concessions {{he had made}} to Kennedy <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> breakdown of the agreement between the Soviet Union and the US. To prevent that, Khrushchev decided to offer to give Cuba more than 100 tactical nuclear weapons that had been shipped to Cuba along with the long-range missiles but, crucially, had escaped the notice of U.S. intelligence. Khrushchev determined that because the Americans had not listed the missiles on their list of demands, keeping them in Cuba {{would be in the}} Soviet Union's interests.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 – International Year of Reconciliation – the day {{was marked}} by a massive number of white doves being {{distributed}} after a formal presentation at the United Nations, bearing in mind the Charter of the United Nations, including the purposes and principles contained therein, and in particular those of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, bringing about by peaceful means, and in conformity {{with the principles of}} justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which <b>might</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> breach of the peace, and practising tolerance and living together in peace with one another as good neighbours, thus developing friendly relations among nations and promoting international cooperation to resolve international economic, social, cultural and humanitarian issues.

According to Shinshu Shimane Kenshi, what Okazaki did might mean his resistance to the Japanese leaders of the war, and their responsibility for the war. In October 1945, Shimane Prefecture issued a warning in order to calm down intraracial strife. Osami Maeda wrote that we should reevaluate the history of terrorism, and he concluded that the Matsue Incident {{was the end of the}} Showa war age, and the last of the Showa age uprisings.
