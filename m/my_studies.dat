40|$|The {{intention}} of <b>my</b> <b>study</b> is {{to investigate the}} preschool educators choice of literature and tocompare this with each other, and if there´s something that is affecting this when PIRLS reportsshows that Swedish students lack reading-, writing- and language skills. In <b>my</b> <b>study,</b> {{one of the questions}} takes the children into consideration according to the preschoolscurriculum, and how the impact from the children plays an important part. I have put together a literature research that I think is relevant for <b>my</b> <b>study,</b> even though Ithink it has been difficult because of the limited research in the topic. <b>My</b> <b>study</b> is based oninterviews with six educators about their experience and thoughts in the same municipality. The perspective is based on the sociocultural theory where the language and the interactionbetween humans is the central starting point. The result describes the different criteria that the educators choose books from. For exampledevelopment of speech and how important it is for the educators that the children have animpact in the preschool activities. In the discussion I examine critically my choice of methodand also what I think could have given me a deeper result. In the end of <b>my</b> <b>study</b> I continuewith the current research where I show what <b>my</b> <b>study</b> can contribute with, to make theeducators more professional. The conclusion of <b>my</b> <b>study</b> is that it doesn´t really matter where the teachers work but it´s theinterest of the teachers that controls the work with the literature and these choices andawareness can be improved, by planning the activities and further cooperation with librariesand mobile library...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>my</b> <b>study</b> was to {{investigate}} about the support that Foundation Phase learners with Mathematical problems receive from different role players and to determine difficulties faced by these learners and educators concerning Mathematical barriers.

This study was of qualitative approach and it was conducted in three different primary schools. In <b>my</b> <b>study,</b> open-ended questions were used in a form of interviews. The interviews took place at the three different schools. Participants were told that their interview was voluntary and they were free to withdraw at any time if they felt uncomfortable. The data was collected by writing response from participants and using tape recorder. It was then transcribed, organised, marked by hand, and coded to produce labels that allowed the key points of the information to be highlighted.

He instanced his own early career: [...] "I studied both at the Royal Academy, Dublin, and the Royal Academy, London, and then in Italy, and when I came back to London, all I could get was an engagement in comic opera where I sang for eighteen months before I could become a principal.

Although many scholars today consider the Treatise to be Hume's most important work {{and one of the most}} important books in Western philosophy, the critics in Great Britain at the time did not agree, describing it as [...] "abstract and unintelligible". As Hume had spent most of his savings during those four years, he resolved [...] "to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every object as contemptible except the improvements of my talents in literature". Despite the disappointment, Hume later wrote, [...] "Being naturally of a cheerful and sanguine temper, I soon recovered from the blow and prosecuted with great ardour <b>my</b> <b>studies</b> in the country." [...] There, in an attempt to make his larger work better known and more intelligible, he published the An Abstract of a Book lately Published as a summary of the main doctrines of the Treatise, without revealing its authorship.
