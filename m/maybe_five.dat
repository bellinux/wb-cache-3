500|$|Instead of {{selecting}} from the numerous, basic backing tracks Sadler had collected before the sessions, Chuck D wanted {{for the production}} team to improvise beats in the studio. This led to much of Fear of a Black Planets music being composed on the spot. Chuck D said he spent numerous hours listening to various tapes, music records, and other audio sources in search of samples for the album. Of their search for samples, Hank Shocklee said, [...] "When you’re talking {{about the kind of}} sampling that Public Enemy did, we had to comb through thousands of records to come up with <b>maybe</b> <b>five</b> good pieces.

Rock was perhaps the last person {{in the music industry}} with whom Barrett kept in contact. In 1971, Rock conducted the final interview of Barrett before his retirement from the music industry a few years later, and Barrett subsequently turned up on Rock's London doorstep [...] "four, <b>maybe</b> <b>five</b> times" [...] for a cup of tea and conversation through 1978, before Barrett moved back to Cambridge. They had not spoken in more than twenty years when Rock approached Barrett to autograph his photography book, and Barrett uncharacteristically agreed.

500|$|Instead {{of using}} {{multitrack}} recording (which was quickly gaining popularity), the Allman Brothers Band opted to cut most of Idlewild South live, {{with all of}} the musicians performing together. On rare occasions, they would go back to overdub sections that weren't up to standard. [...] "The idea is that part of the thing of the Allman Brothers is the spontaneity — the elasticity. The parts and tempos vary in a way that only they are sensitive to", said Dowd. Duane often left a song alone for more work and testing out on the road. [...] "They would record <b>maybe</b> <b>five</b> songs. Then they might say, 'I don't think that song was good enough,' or, 'I don't think that song was ready to record,", remembered Dowd. Joel Dorn, predominantly a jazz producer for Atlantic, stepped in to produce one song on the album, [...] "Please Call Home", which was recorded at Regency Sound Studios on July 14, 1970. The band were in New York at the time and Dowd was unavailable.|$|E

Dano only had four days to prepare for the much larger role of Eli Sunday, but he researched the time period that the film is set in as well as evangelical preachers. The previous two weeks of scenes with Sunday and Plainview had to be re-shot with Dano instead of O'Neill. The interior mansion scenes were filmed at the Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills, the former real-life home of Edward Doheny Jr., a gift from his father, Edward Doheny. Scenes filmed at Greystone involved the careful renovation of the basement's two-lane bowling alley.

2500|$|Although Watson is {{well known}} for his alleged 1943 statement, [...] "I think there is a world market for <b>maybe</b> <b>five</b> computers," [...] there is scant {{evidence}} he said it. Author Kevin Maney tried to find the origin of the quote, but has been unable to locate any speeches or documents of Watson's that contain this, nor are the words present in any contemporary articles about IBM. One of the very first attributions may be found in The Experts Speak, a book written by Christopher Cerf and Victor S. Navasky in 1984, however Cerf and Navasky just quote from a book written by Morgan and Langford, Facts and Fallacies. Another early article source (May 15, 1985) is a column by Neil Morgan, a San Diego Evening Tribune writer who wrote: [...] "Forrest Shumway, chairman of The Signal Cos., doesn't make predictions. His role model is Tom Watson, then IBM chairman, who said in 1958: 'I think there is a world market for about five computers. The earliest known citation on the Internet is from 1986 on Usenet in the signature of a poster from Convex Computer Corporation as I think there is a world market for about five computers' —Remark attributed to Thomas J. Watson (Chairman of the Board of International Business Machines), 1943". All these early quotes are questioned by Eric Weiss, an editor of the Annals of the History of Computing in ACS letters in 1985.|$|E

[...] On July 24, 2007, Gonzales testified that he and Card were also concerned about Ashcroft's competency. [...] "Obviously there was concern about General Ashcroft's condition. [...] And we would not have sought nor did we intend to get any approval from General Ashcroft if in fact he wasn't fully competent to make the decision." [...] In response to a question from Senator Hatch, Gonzales continued, [...] "Obviously we were concerned about the condition of General Ashcroft. [...] We obviously knew he had been ill and had surgery. [...] And we never had any intent to ask anything of him if we did not feel that he was competent. [...] When we got there, I will just say that Mr. Ashcroft did most of the talking. [...] We were there <b>maybe</b> <b>five</b> minutes – five to six minutes.

[...] According to the CIA factbook, Russia has severely disabled the Chechen separatist movement, although sporadic violence still occurs throughout the North Caucasus. The overall security situation in Chechnya remains exceedingly difficult to accurately report due to the near monopoly the Russian government has on media covering the issue. In May 2007, Amnesty International refuted claims by the government that the conflict has ended, stating [...] "while large-scale military operations have been reduced, the conflict continues." [...] The strength of the separatists has for many years been unknown. Although Russia has killed a lot of separatists throughout the war, many young fighters have joined the separatists.|$|R
