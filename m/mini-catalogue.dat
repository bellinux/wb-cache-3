At Athabasca University (AU) researchers have initiated {{a process for}} the implementation of the AU Press catalogue of books and journals. They decided to create an AU Press <b>mini-catalogue</b> accessible on the iPhone and iPod using the Lexcycle Stanza app. Because of problems, and on the advice of Lexcycle, researchers implemented the AU press as a trial or beta custom catalog. Problems encountered included the necessity of converting AU Press pdf files to the Epub format; properly converting the cover image and thumbnail; systemic errors when converting binary-encoded pdfs; adding the Atom publishing RSS step to the workflow; quality control of the non-native Epub files; and serious formatting and spacing errors. Additional technical work in order to facilitate a smoother transition is required, including the creation of web-based forms, writing documentation and personnel training. The article will be useful for others beginning the development of educational applications for iphones and other smart portable device...|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} main {{catalogue}} launches per year, with seasonal <b>mini-catalogues</b> issued more frequently to highlight certain items. The entire line changed {{twice a year}} with few exceptions. New items were introduced only with a new catalogue. A few specialty lines, such as batteries, film and some jewellery lines on counter racks, and were {{not found in the}} catalogue. Photo processing was another service available in many stores.|$|R
