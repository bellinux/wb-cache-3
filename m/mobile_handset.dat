2500|$|Hutchison {{formerly}} operated an Australian CDMA network {{under the}} Orange brand name, as Orange One. It allowed customers {{to use their}} 3 Branded CDMA mobile phone as a Home phone when at home. Calls made from their mobile were charged at rates {{similar to those of}} a Landline. Customers also received a [...] "Local Zone [...] " [...] number allowing them to be called on a Landline number whilst at home. Should the phone be out of the Local zone, Calls made to the landline number either diverted to the Mobile number at a small fee, or was directed to Voicemail on the <b>mobile</b> <b>handset.</b> These plans started at a very competitive price of $10.00 per month, and local calls from the local Zone to a local landline was charged at 20c per local call, making their service cheaper than those of Telstra or Optus. The Orange One network was not as vast as others, and so Orange made arrangements with Telstra to allow the services of Orange one devices to roam to the Telstra network On 1 February 2006, it was rebranded as 3 CDMA, and this network was closed as of 9 August 2006. 3 CDMA customers were offered special tariffs and incentives to continue as customers on the 3G network, all customers either moved over to 3's 3G network or to other network providers.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} methodologies that allow a <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> to be {{integrated}} into a VoIP network. One implementation turns the mobile device into a standard SIP client, which then uses a data network to send and receive SIP messaging, and to send and receive RTP for the voice path. This methodology of turning a <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> into a standard SIP client requires that the <b>mobile</b> <b>handset</b> support, at minimum, high speed IP communications. In this application, standard VoIP protocols (typically SIP) are used over any broadband IP-capable wireless network connection such as EVDO rev A (which is symmetrical high speed — both high speed up and down), HSPA, Wi-Fi or WiMAX.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the mechanisms of mobile network service evolution through a closer examination of the context of <b>mobile</b> <b>handsets.</b> It aims first to establish quantitatively that <b>mobile</b> <b>handsets</b> are a determinant of mobile network service evolution patterns, and second, to develop a consistent perspective capable of explaining the evolution of various mobile network services. Despite the fact that <b>mobile</b> <b>handsets</b> are indispensable to users of mobile network services, surprisingly little is known about the role of these <b>handsets</b> in <b>mobile</b> network service evolution. This paper provides quantitative evidence of a positive relationship between intra-network-carrier penetration rates for mobile network service subscribers and <b>mobile</b> <b>handsets</b> designed for these services. The relationship is such that if one network service is diffused more than another, the <b>mobile</b> <b>handsets</b> related to the more diffused service are similarly more widely diffused in the market, and vice versa. The evidence is derived from an analysis of two mobile network services in Japan, mobile Internet and third generation mobile, initiated by NTT DoCoMo and KDDI. There are no existing studies that consistently explain the mechanisms of different mobile network service evolution patterns. Since the positive relationship that emerges from the analysis is consistent for both cases, by examining the mechanisms underlying this relationship, the paper develops an adequate and consistent perspective based on a constituent model reflecting the technological and competition structure of mobile network services. From this perspective, this positive relationship can be explained as the similarity or dissimilarity in essential technology ownership distribution across constituents. This perspective describes mobile network evolution in terms of changes in the distribution of essential technology ownership and, therefore, could be generalised more widely.
