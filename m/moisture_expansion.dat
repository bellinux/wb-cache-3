Fiber reinforced polymer composite materials can satisfy these requirements with an appropriate stacking sequence using optimization methods and hence dimensionally stable composites are obtained. In this thesis, two different materials carbon/epoxy and E-glass/epoxy composites are considered. Both materials {{have been used for}} optimization, stress and failure analysis. However, only for E-glass/epoxy, experimental studies have been performed including determination of stiffness, strength characteristics, Poisson's ratio, fiber volume fraction, glass transition temperature (Tg) and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). The objective of optimization part is to design the stacking sequence of the carbon/epoxy and E-glass/epoxy laminated composites having low CTE and high elastic moduli. In design process, multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization of the carbon/epoxy composite plates are verified by single-objective optimization approach by using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Generalized Pattern Search (GPS) and Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithms. MATLAB Optimization Toolbox is used to obtain Pareto-optimal designs and global optimum points for different model problems. Stress and strain distributions are presented through the thickness of the laminates subjected to mechanical, thermal, and hygral loadings.

Therefore, {{it is important to know}} moisture effects on mechanical properties of plastic packaging materials, especially CME. <b>Moisture</b> induced <b>expansion</b> can be calculated using epsiv = beta middot c, here epsiv is the strain, beta is the CME and C is the moisture concentration. Traditionally using the combined TGA (thermal gravimetric analyzer) /TMA (thermal mechanical analyzer) technique, the CME of plastic packaging materials is characterized. TGA is used to measure the weight change and TMA is used to measure the length change. By combining both the TMA and TGA measurements, the CME can be determined. This method is often used in industry and it is observed that the CME value is often over estimated. In order to get precise CME values a high precision DMA (dynamic mechanical analyzer) is used to measure the length change of a sample while a humidity generator is used to regulate the relative humidity. Therefore, temperature and relative humidity are controlled in the DMA chamber and can be used to measure the length change under different relative humidity conditions. CME values measured by the DMA plus humidity method are much lower than that of the TGA/TMA method. In order to find out which method is more reliable, a third experiment was done. A bi-material sample is created to verify our measured CME value. TDM equipment (oven + camera system to detect vertical displacement of the sample) is used to measure the warpage of the bi-material sample.

30|$|The poor {{state of}} {{preservation}} of the glaze may be linked with harsh weather conditions—big changes in relative humidity and ambient temperature—that led to formation of cracks in the surface layer of the tiles. The climate in Malbork is classified by Koppen as humid continental, which means the tiles are exposed to high humidity. As Malbork is situated in the coastal area (ca 40  km from the Baltic sea), NaCl could penetrate the glaze through the microcracks. Water, when freezing in the microcracks expands in volume and causes fractures. Porous materials, such as ceramics, absorb water during the rain and expand. <b>Moisture</b> <b>expansion</b> of the ceramic body is a known phenomenon [38, 39].

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of long-term <b>moisture</b> <b>expansion</b> in fired clay ceramics requires finding {{a relationship between}} the reactivity of a ceramic material with moisture and time. Recently a (time) 1 / 4 law has been proposed which provides a precise relationship between <b>moisture</b> <b>expansion</b> and mass gain in fired clay ceramics and time. However, mass gain studies rather than expansive strain studies provide a more accurate and fundamental measure of the reactivity of fired clay ceramics with moisture. The possibility of using the (time) 1 / 4 law to describe rate of mass gain and consequently to predict <b>moisture</b> <b>expansion</b> in fired clay ceramics with time requires study of the effect of chemical composition and firing temperature on the linear dependence of mass gain on (time) 1 / 4. Pure kaolinite as well as kaolinite mixed with controlled additions of alkali and alkaline-earth metals were employed in this study. These materials were fired at temperatures between 800 °C and 1200 °C. Mass gain due to the chemical combination of the fired materials with moisture was measured using a recording microbalance under tightly controlled environmental conditions of temperature and relative humidity. The mass gain results show that the (time) 1 / 4 law can be used to obtain an accurate linear relationship between long-term mass gain and time at almost all firing temperatures and at all different compositions. The presence of alkali metals was found to strongly affect the chemical combination of fired clay ceramics with moisture and hence affect the rate of mass gain. On the other hand, alkaline earth metals were found to produce similar reaction kinetics to kaolinite alone.
