Instead, the computer is a chameleon-like or even promiscuous assistant, whose services {{can be applied to}} any number of tasks and whose capabilities can be defined endlessly from application to application. Binkley refers to the computer as a non-specific technology and an incorporeal <b>metamedium.</b> Yet the computer contains phenomena not found in other media: namely, a conceptual space where symbolic content can be modified using mathematical abstractions. The notion of an “original” and its consequent value are considered irrelevant, obsolete, or inapplicable to computer art.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{illustrate}} how designers attempt to engage audiences through different media in TV idents; and to explore how the human mark (such as drawing and model making) in a hybrid with digital media can not only revitalise traditions in design, but also the reception of illusion in this context. Design/methodology/approach – The study focuses on the work of RedBee Media, a company that has a global market and reputation. The phenomenology of how BBC Three and BBC 2 Christmas were rebranded was examined through interviews with the designers and animators involved. Taking a media industry studies lens to examine an art/technology divide the author will expand the visual culture theory of Manovich’s (2007) <b>metamedium.</b> Findings – The influence of technology on television graphic design is contested and continual. Designers might begin to question rather than rely on technology through the process of design. They can confront generic software solutions and apply more critical skills to explore fusions of heritage and digital processes in a <b>metamedium.</b> Research limitations/implications – This research was focused on a UK broadcaster and a single UK creative agency with a global influence. Future research should examine leading creative practice in other international markets. Practical implications – The significance of this research is in understanding the materiality and creativity in the artform of TV idents and how designers attempt to engage audiences through different media. Originality/value – Academics in media and design history are acknowledging the cultural significance of television branding. Design practitioners need to understand why and how in the work of others...|$|E
40|$|A {{large body}} of opinion {{describes}} interactivity as means to overcome the unidirection-ality of the message from editorial systems to audiences. Many have envisaged in this potential {{the beginning of an}} era in which audiences can influence editorial policy with their opinions and comments, can provide news, can have a better relationship with 'their ' newspapers and can form a new relationship with other readers, building a more active public opinion. This analysis looks {{to the development of a}} more democratic media in which people, using the Internet, can significantly condition the process of news production and the development of political actions. Unfortunately, this debate has often been concentrated in an abstract examination of the ideal possibilities of the Internet as a new <b>metamedium,</b> rather than exploration of what really has happened. Emails and forums are commonly seen as major elements of interactivity. Within the COST A 20 Action exploring the Impact of Internet on Mass Media, a sub-group of researchers was formed willing to investigate what is going on in online newspapers with regard to interactivity. The sub-group limited itself to observing the forums pres-ent in the front pages of newspaper web editions. This unit of analysis has been cho-sen because forums present objective data, easily accessible by audiences and so also by researchers. The sample of newspaper sites comprises some of the major online dail...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1992. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 144 - 174) Microfiche. xvi, 202 leaves, bound ill. (some col.) 29 cmThis study {{presents a}} broad-based conceptual analysis of human-computer interactions {{from the perspective}} of play and transformation. Examples of computer play and transformation are provided from art, science, simulation, virtual reality, and education. The spirit of play is an especially fitting and heuristic conceptualization to adopt in reflecting upon the use of computers. The computer can then be seen as an instrument that allows for free movement within mental playing fields that have no fixed boundaries: here, multiple, hybrid, even "inconceivable" games may be played and alternate realities may be explored. The computer is a device like no other-s-one that acts as a new kind of psychological mirror, a metaphoric, electronic Rorschach inkblot for the user. The computer can simulate any medium-real or otherwise-that we can imagine, and like all media, it not only shapes the world but also shapes the user in a process of continual interaction. Paradoxically, the computer's lack of character is its essential characteristic; its characterlessness, the source of its transformative power. As a <b>metamedium,</b> the computer's representational and functional abilities are without precedent, influencing not only our perception of the computer, but also our perception of ourselves. If we consciously enter into our interactions with computers, the transformative effects made possible through the mutual play of mind and computer will dramatically affect the future of our society...|$|E
40|$|Various {{issues and}} {{practices}} related to computerized simulation are outlined, partic-ularly {{in relation to}} the other papers in this special issue of SSCORE. These cover such aspects as learning as both pedagogy and research, the "philosophy " of simulation, the relations between and the relative prominence of simulation techniques and computer technology, and various problems related to modelling, design, evaluation, and as-sumptions. Keywords computerized simulation, computers, learning, modelling, pedagogy, research, simulation, simulation design, simware. Two developments have recently caught the imagination of both edu-cators and researchers: computers and simulations. When these two are combined, we have a potentially very powerful methodology; indeed some of the most interesting educational software includes simulation, and many of the more powerful simulations contain some computer element. Many types of simulation are ideally suited to the computer, and the computer is often an ideal medium for simulation. The promise of computerized simulations is intimated in Kaye’s (1984) description of the computer itself: The protean nature of the computer is such that it can act like a ma-chine or like a language to be shaped and exploited. It is a medium that can dynamically simulate the details of any other medium, including media that cannot exist physically. It is the first <b>metamedium,</b> and as such it has degrees of freedom for representation and expression never before encountered and as yet barely investigated. Even more impor-tant, it is fun, and therefore intrinsically worth doing. The term computerized simulation (CS) refers to a simulation which, in some form or another, includes the use of a computer. It may mean a simulation which has (literally) &dquo;been computerized,&dquo; that is, an origi-nally manual simulation which has had part or all of its parameters an...|$|E
