5|$|Not {{long after}} the alert was issued, deep {{convection}} disappeared from the low while located 400mi (645km). Convection was anticipated to redeveloped later that night or early the next morning. The low was <b>moving</b> <b>slowly</b> towards the northwest due to a deep trough located over the Gulf of Mexico and a ridge of high pressure located over western Mexico. By the morning of July 3, convection had redeveloped near the low and its forward motion quickly increased to 11mph (18km/h). The low remained disorganized {{for the next two}} days as it steadily moved towards the northwest.|$|E
5|$|On September 21, a {{tropical}} wave – a trough of relatively low atmospheric pressure – began <b>moving</b> <b>slowly</b> westward {{from the west}} coast of Africa, passing near the Cape Verde islands on September 23. Though the wave was disorganized, a low-level circulation developed on September 24 a few hundred miles to the southwest of Cape Verde. Steady organization ensued, including the development of convection into curved bands around the system. Though it lacked a well-defined center, the system organized enough to be classified Tropical Depression Sixteen on September 25 while located about 920mi (1,480km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{began to}} slowly weaken and lose tropical characteristics on early September 12 {{as it moved}} over colder waters and encountered increasing wind shear. However, the storm was moving quickly enough to make landfall over Cape Breton, Nova Scotia as a Category1 hurricane on September 12. Later that morning, Gustav made a second landfall in Newfoundland and became extratropical shortly after.

5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance moved northward, crossing Guatemala {{from the eastern}} Pacific ocean into the northwest Caribbean Sea between September 20 and September 21. It became a tropical cyclone soon after emerging into the Caribbean, and moved across the Yucatán Peninsula as a tropical depression before becoming a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on September 22 and a hurricane on September 23. It turned sharply east-northeast across the Mouth of the Mississippi river on September 24 as a minor hurricane. The storm continued east-northeast and made landfall in Florida east of Pensacola. The system evolved into an extratropical cyclone soon after passing out of the Sunshine State and continued moving east to northeast hugging the Atlantic Seaboard to near the Virginia Capes before <b>moving</b> <b>slowly</b> through the shipping lanes between Canada and Bermuda, blocked by a high pressure system in southeast Canada.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa on September10. Tracking westward, the wave split into two portions, with the slower-moving northern portion ultimately developing into Atlantic Tropical Depression Nine on September16. The southern portion crossed Venezuela and Colombia and emerged into the Pacific, where a large area of deep convection began to form. A well-defined low pressure area developed on September26, and organized into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC (1p.m.CDT) the same day while situated about 335mi (540km) southwest of Acapulco, Guerrero. Six hours later, after banding features became more defined and intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique showed a slight increase in intensity, the depression was classified as a tropical storm and was accordingly named Marty by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). At the time, the storm was <b>moving</b> <b>slowly</b> northward due to the influence of a large mid- to upper-level trough.|$|E
5|$|On October14, a {{tropical}} depression was first observed over the western Caribbean Sea, {{just off the}} eastern Honduras coast. It was a large and weak tropical cyclone, <b>moving</b> <b>slowly</b> northwestward and gradually intensifying. On October15, it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status, and its strengthening became more steady. The next day, the storm reached hurricane status about 130mi (215km) southeast of Cozumel, Quintana Roo. Around that time, it began to execute a small counterclockwise loop off {{the east coast of}} the Yucatán Peninsula. By October18 the hurricane completed the loop, during which its winds increased to 115mph (185km/h); this is the equivalence of a major hurricane, or a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The estimation of its strength at this point was based on subsequent analysis of peripheral recordings of atmospheric pressure and maximum sustained winds by ships and land stations.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen formed {{over the}} {{northern}} Bahamas on September 6. Early on September 7, it organized into Tropical Storm Ophelia, becoming a hurricane the next day. It churned nearly stationary {{for two days}} {{off the coast of}} Florida where significant coastal erosion resulted from the churning waves. On September 12, the storm began <b>moving</b> <b>slowly</b> toward North Carolina, at times nearly stalling and alternating between tropical storm and hurricane intensity. The hurricane did not make landfall, although the western eyewall reached the coastal areas of North Carolina, causing extensive damage in the Outer Banks and around Cape Fear. Ophelia moved north and became extratropical late on September 17 near Nova Scotia, but it continued northeastward, producing strong winds and heavy rain over Atlantic Canada.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Ophelia was a {{long-lived}} {{and powerful}} tropical cyclone that had devastating {{impacts on the}} small atoll of Ulithi in the Caroline Islands. Forming as a tropical depression on November21, 1960 near Enewetak Atoll, the incipient cyclone struggled to develop. Moving haphazardly along an s-shaped track over the western Pacific Ocean, it degenerated into a disturbance two days later. By November27, the system reorganized and was classified a tropical depression {{for a second time}} well to the southeast of Guam. <b>Moving</b> <b>slowly</b> west-southwest, it steadily intensified into a tropical storm later that day and further into a typhoon on November29 as it gained a steady westward track. The following day, the eye of Ophelia passed directly over Ulithi atoll with winds estimated at 230km/h (145mph).|$|E
5|$|A dissipating {{cold front}} stalled across the {{northeast}}ern Atlantic Ocean on September7, {{northeast of the}} Azores. That day, a closed circulation developed and quickly became independent of the front. Based on a uniform thermal structure, as well as ship reports {{in the region of}} gale-force winds near the center, it is estimated that the system became a tropical storm early on September8. That day, the system moved west-southwestward, atypical for cyclones in that region during September. On September9, the storm turned to the southeast, reaching estimated peak winds of 50mph (85km/h), based on ship observations. <b>Moving</b> <b>slowly</b> through the northern Azores, the storm produced winds of 35mph (55km/h) along Terceira Island. It slowly weakened, and by late on September10 the system degraded into a tropical depression. By the next day, the system was interacting with an approaching cold front, indicating that the depression had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Around 20:00UTC, the storm moved ashore the southwestern tip of Portugal with gale-force winds. The storm turned to the northwest through the Iberian Peninsula, dissipating on September14 over southwestern France.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} peak winds, Tropical Storm Chantal became disorganized {{while the}} center became ill-defined and situated to the west-southwest {{of the main}} area of convection; {{this was due to}} unfavorable upper-level winds, although computer models continued to forecast a more favorable upper-level environment. By early on August20, Hurricane Hunters reported several low-level circulations embedded within a large low pressure area. Later that day, wind shear decreased when the storm moved into the Gulf of Honduras. Chantal became much better organized, again reaching peak winds of 70miles per hour (110km/h) before making landfall early on August21 near the border of Mexico and Belize. Initially, the storm was forecast to cross the Yucatán Peninsula and Bay of Campeche and make a second landfall in the state of Veracruz. Chantal slowly weakened over land while <b>moving</b> <b>slowly</b> across northern Belize. Convection decreased markedly late on August21, and early the next day Chantal weakened to tropical depression status. The upper- and middle-level circulations turned to the northeast while the low-level circulation turned to the west-southwest further inland. Weakening continued, and late on August22 Chantal dissipated over the Mexican state of Tabasco.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} {{passed over the}} Azores, several weather stations reported low barometric pressures, with the lowest being a measurement of 984 mbar (hPa; 29.06 inHg) on Terceira Island at 0600 UTC on September 25. As {{a result of the}} impending storm, several Pan Am Clipper flights to the archipelago were suspended for three consecutive days. The maximum reported gust in the Azores was an observation of 65mph (100km/h) on September25. As a result of <b>moving</b> <b>slowly</b> over the islands, torrential rainfall was also reported. At Angra do Heroísmo, 13.11in (333mm) of precipitation was reported in a four-day, accounting for a third of the station's yearly average rainfall. Strong storm surge was reported at the same location. The waves swept boats away from the coasts of islands. Further inland, there was extensive damage to homes and crops, though no people died. Despite evidence that the system had distinct tropical characteristics, it was not operationally added to HURDAT.|$|E
5|$|Based upon {{scientific}} {{research conducted by}} the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Hurricane Research Division in 2003, the cyclone is estimated to have first begun as a 60mph (100km/h) tropical storm south of Mayaguana in the Bahamas early on September9. However, due to scarce observations, its genesis likely occurred earlier than this time but was undetected operationally. <b>Moving</b> <b>slowly</b> northwest, the cyclone quickly strengthened into a hurricane with winds of 75mph (120km/h), equivalent to Category1 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, early the next day. By 00:00UTC on September11, it reached sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) while centered about 15miles (25km) west of New Providence Island. Turning to the west-northwest, the cyclone maintained its intensity while passing {{just north of the}} Bimini Islands. Around 23:00UTC on September12, the cyclone struck South Florida near Fort Lauderdale with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Thereafter, the hurricane weakened upon crossing the Everglades, weakening to a tropical storm at 06:00UTC on September12.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Iris was {{the ninth}} named storm and fifth {{hurricane}} of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Iris {{was the first}} of three tropical cyclones to affect the Lesser Antilles in a three-week period, preceding the more destructive hurricanes Luis and Marilyn. It developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles on August22 and attained hurricane status within 30hours. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm before crossing the islands of the eastern Caribbean from August26 through August28. During that time, Iris became one of four active tropical storms in the Atlantic basin. Earlier it had interacted with Hurricane Humberto, and beginning on August30, Iris interacted with Tropical Storm Karen. Iris re-intensified into a hurricane and attained peak sustained winds of 110mph (175km/h) while <b>moving</b> <b>slowly</b> across the central Atlantic. The hurricane accelerated to the north and absorbed a dissipating Tropical Depression Karen on September3. Iris weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical on September4, though its remnants reattained hurricane-force winds before affecting western Europe on September7.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Mitch {{formed on}} October22 {{in the southwestern}} Caribbean Sea, and it {{eventually}} intensified into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale by October26. By that time, the hurricane was {{just north of the}} coast of Honduras, and was expected by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models to turn to the north. When the track was more westward than expected, the NHC recommended early on October26 for a hurricane warning to be issued for the northeastern Honduran coast, although difficulties in communications prevented their immediate implementation. Within a few hours, a hurricane warning was in place between Limón to the Honduras and Nicaragua border, including the offshore Swan Island. When Mitch still failed to turn to the north, the government of Honduras issued a hurricane warning for the remainder of their coastline. The hurricane weakened while turning to the south, and made landfall in Honduras 134km (83mi) east of La Ceiba, with estimated winds of 130km/h (80mph). Mitch continued to weaken while <b>moving</b> <b>slowly</b> westward across the country.|$|E
5|$|Many adult insects use six {{legs for}} walking and {{have adopted a}} tripedal gait. The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied {{extensively}} in cockroaches and ants. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step, the middle right leg and {{the front and rear}} left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on. The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds. However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits. For example, when <b>moving</b> <b>slowly,</b> turning, avoiding obstacles, climbing or slippery surfaces, four (tetrapod) or more feet (wave-gait) may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.|$|E
