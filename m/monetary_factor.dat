50|$|Orffs {{relationship}} with German fascism and the Nazi Party {{has been a}} matter of considerable debate and analysis. His Carmina Burana was hugely popular in Nazi Germany after its premiere in Frankfurt in 1937. Given Orffs previous lack of commercial success, the <b>monetary</b> <b>factor</b> of Carmina Buranas acclaim was significant to him. But the composition, with its unfamiliar rhythms, was also denounced with racist taunts. He {{was one of the few}} German composers under the Nazi regime who responded to the official call to write new incidental music for A Midsummer Nights Dream after the music of Felix Mendelssohn had been banned. Defenders of Orff note that he had already composed music for this play as early as 1917 and 1927, long before this was a favor for the Nazi regime.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, I use sectoral data to {{identify}} aggregate common factors and then quantify {{the contribution of}} these factors to economic fluctuations. Using a combination of long-run and sign restrictions {{to identify}} aggregate monetary and productivity factors, I find that the <b>monetary</b> <b>factor</b> is responsible for long swings in nominal variables but has little effect on fluctuations in output, real wage, or labor input growth. The productivity factor in addition to increasing output growth and real wage growth in the short and long runs, also results in increases in labor input and decreases in prices, but the quantitative effect of the productivity factor on labor input is relatively small. These results are robust {{to the number of}} factors included in the model and to alternative priors about the short-run effects of the <b>monetary</b> <b>factor,</b> and to the inclusion of oil prices. Finally, the oil price factor has only a modest effect on economic fluctuations and, in fact, oil prices are largely driven by the other aggregate factors...|$|E

We discuss economic background of inflation policy in Japan and analyze the impacts of the policy. Japanese economy is in a liquidity trap now. Two types of reasons were pointed out to be in liquidity traps. They are a real factor and a <b>monetary</b> <b>factor.</b> The former factor is the case analyzed by Krugman, where IS curve shifts due to structural reason such as aging of population. Under this condition a negative real interest rate is requested {{to escape from the}} liquidity trap. However, liquidity trap can also arise from monetary reason and the scenario of escape from the trap is different. We illustrate the case where deflationary expectation leads the economy to a liquidity trap. If it is necessary to utilize monetary policy for generating inflation expectation, we then need some explicit monetary policy rules, which is strong enough to escape from liquidity traps {{but at the same time}} which is effective to suppress unnecessary political pressure and to keep the independence of the central bank. Inflation targeting is a candidate for such a rule. ...|$|E

40|$|C. R. Whittlesey {{points out}} that there are three kinds of ideas as to the role of money in {{economic}} growth. The first is the idea that money is an active factor {{in the sense that it}} initiates and determines, in and of itself, the processes of economic growth. The second recognizes money to be a factor conditioning the growth potentials which are determined by other real factors. The third holds that money is a passive factor, accommodating to rather than initiating or conditioning-changes in business activity. Being classified from this point of view, the monetary notions underlying most of the contemporary theories of economic growth seem to fall into the third category. But the writer thinks of money as not a passive, but a permissive factor at minimum. So, in this article, he intends to investigate the effect of monetary conditions on the process of economic growth, and obtain the consistent monetary condition with steady growth. We can observe that a very small number of writers have dealt with the problem of the relation of the monetary condition to economic growth. J. R. Hicks is one of them. He, however, gives <b>monetary</b> <b>factor</b> only a secondary importance at most and, in addition, he fails to find out any point at which <b>monetary</b> <b>factor</b> should be tied up with real factor. Neverthless, he gives us a hint for solving the problem. It is that the value of investment coefficient may vary with different monetary conditions. The most important monetary problem concerning economic growth occurs in the form of how to finance ever increasing investment. We can not ignor this financial problem. If the supply of investible fund for each individual firm is not infinitely elastic, an increase in firms' demand for fund will cause a rise in the cost of raising it, which is the result of rises both in interest payment and in subjective risk accompaning the increase of borrowed capital relative to the firms' equity capital. Any rise in the cost of raising fund, according to the hint given by Hicks, will reduce firms' investment. In multiplier-accelerator model this implies that accelerator coefficient is not a constant, but a variable depending on both interest rate and the ratio of borrowed capital to equity capital in firms' consolidated balance sheet. Hence, steady growth in multiplier-accelerator model requires appropriate monetary condition, which must be a condition allowing firms to finance adequately increasing investment for making money income grow at steady rate without a rise in the rate of interest and deterioration in firms' consolidated balance sheet. Such a condition is that money supply is increasing at the same rate as the smaller root of the system. This is the writer's conclusion attained in this article, which is different from what K. K. Kurihara or J. S. Duesenberry considers desirable for economic growth...|$|E
40|$|Individual {{preferences}} concerning {{retirement age}} are strongly differentiated {{both within and}} between countries. According to the Share survey, the proportion of workers aged from 50 to 65 who wished to retire {{as soon as possible}} in 2004 ranged from 31 % in the Netherlands to 67 % in Spain. Such a preference for early retirement can depend on both financial and non financial factors. Non financial factors include working conditions, health status and mortality expectations. Economic or "monetary" factors essentially correspond to the magnitude of pension entitlements and how they depend upon retirement age. Entitlements that depend positively on retirement age should reduce the motivation to retire as soon as possible. This paper compares the role of these different factors by combining individual data from the Share survey with macroeconomic indicators of pension entitlements recently produced by the OECD. Health and work conditions come out as strong determinants of the preference for early retirement. Being generally satisfied with one's work leads to a drop of approximately 16 percentage points in the probability of wishing to retire as soon as possible. Declaring oneself in bad or very bad health has a positive effect on this probability of a comparable order of magnitude. However, these non financial factors do not significantly contribute to the explanation of cross-country differentials. Conversely, financial factors seem to have a lower impact at micro-level, but a higher one for the explanation of cross-country differentials.

40|$|Monetary {{aggregates}} {{continue to}} play an important role in the ECB''s policy strategy. This paper revisits the case for money, surveying the ongoing theoretical and empirical debate. The key conclusion is that an exclusive focus on non-monetary factors alone may leave the ECB with an incomplete picture of the economy. However, treating monetary factors as a separate matter is a second-best solution. Instead, a general-equilibrium inspired analytical framework that merges the economic and monetary "pillars" of the ECB''s policy strategy appears the most promising way forward. The role played by monetary aggregates in such unified framework may be rather limited. However, an integrated framework would facilitate the presentation of policy decisions by providing a clearer narrative of the relative role of money in the interaction with other economic and financial sector variables, including asset prices, and their impact on consumer prices.

However, much of the literature in the area of macroeconomics of agriculture mainly focused on the linkage between exchange rates and agricultural commodity trade; relatively little attention has been given to other macrointerconnections such as interest rates, inflation, and income linkages;This study examines the interrelationships between the macrosector and agriculture by incorporating exchange rates, interest rates, inflation, and income linkages in a general equilibrium macroeconometric model. Using this model, the effects of changes in U. S. monetary policies on the U.

40|$|After the {{implementation}} of Statutory Minimum Wage, the manpower shortage problem in the property management field becomes more intensive, especially among frontline posts. The fight for frontline staff does not only comes within the industry, but also from other industries as well. In view of the situation, this paper tries {{to find out what}} can be done by property management companies to reduce the manpower shortage among frontline posts. The two directions – retention of existing staff and recruitment of potential new staff are investigated and discussed. This study mainly investigates the situation in large-scale property management companies as they have more resources on formulating retention and recruitment strategy. In order to know the full picture of the issue, primary data investigating the views from frontline staff and from management representatives are collected to know about the actual situation secondary data of research on past study are collected to know about the empirical background and formulate conceptual framework in the analysis. Questionnaires are distributed to 150 existing staff and 150 new recruits respectively with 103 received from existing staff and 101 received from new recruits. Besides, in order to know the opinion of management, interviews are conducted with 3 property managers from different companies on their views of the impact of statutory minimum wage, the factors which are believed to be affecting their intention and the strategies being used by their company. The survey results show that existing staff intention to stay is affected more by non-monetary factors like relationship and stress while new recruits are more attracted by <b>monetary</b> <b>factors</b> like salary and benefits. In the interview with property managers, all of them agree with that <b>monetary</b> <b>factors</b> play a more important role in the attraction of new recruits.

However, it is also important to understand customer dissatisfaction in order to maintain a sustainable business, given that the negative effects of customer dissatisfaction in service businesses may be even greater than the positive effects of satisfaction. This study investigates customer dissatisfaction in the hotel context. In particular, firstly, this study is to identify dissatisfiers and satisfiers, and compare dissatisfiers to satisfiers based on Herzberg's two-factor theory by analyzing online hotel reviews generated by customers. Secondly, this approach is applied to compare between upscale and budget hotels, which can show different levels of customer expectation. Thirdly, it examines its consequences by focusing on the effect of customer dissatisfaction on attitude toward a hotel. It identifies a role for attitude in the relationship between customer dissatisfaction and negative behavioral intention (switching service provider, spreading negative word-of-mouth, and complaining). Fourthly, it is to compare the dissatisfaction relationship paths for two datasets drawn from customers of different hotel classes of upscale and budget hotels. Results of Study I showed the two distinct sets of satisfiers and dissatisfiers in upscale hotels with the exception of two overlapped service-related factors, the results in budget hotels revealed the two sets of satisfiers and dissatisfiers with five common factors which are one service-related, one <b>monetary</b> <b>factor,</b> and three room facilities-related factors. As a result, the most critical factor was "staff and their attitude. " In addition, results of Study II showed a full mediating role of attitude toward a hotel in the relationship between customer dissatisfaction and negative behavioral intention (switching service provider,spreading negative word-of-mouth,and complaining). The relationship paths between upscale and budget hotel datasets showed a same pattern for upscale and budget hotel customers.

Sustainable practices require a controlled setting within an urban system where their practicality and efficacy could be assessed. The aim of the thesis is to establish an environmental assessment tool based on urban metabolism approach to assist decision-making during environmental and economic assessment. The outcome provides understanding on the means of integrating carbon footprint and <b>monetary</b> <b>factor</b> to oversee the expenditure of a nation in general, or a household or an individual in particular, in relation to global warming potential. This study applied a retrospective cross sectional study to provide a form of environmental assessment in developing economic-environmental input-output model for greenhouse gases emission monitoring and climate change adaptation. Methodologically, the potential impact from economic sectors’ contribution on greenhouse gas emissions which eventually leads to global warming and climate change was quantitatively assessed. Firstly, the contribution of greenhouse gas emission from each economic activity was examined. Secondly, the association of greenhouse gas emissions with gross output value from each economic activity was assessed to ascertain the greenhouse gas intensity. Finally, a preliminary environmental-economic input-output tool were developed for potential global warming forecasting assessment and improving the surveillance system of each target economic sector concerning climate change. The input-output analysis method development found that Barcelona with 14 economic sectors has carbon dioxide emission to be 24. 44 kg CO 2 - eq. /cap/day. The method adaptation to Malaysia resulted with greenhouse gas emission of all 120 economic activities with 4. 87 kg CO 2 - eq. /cap/day. Greenhouse gases from waste management was not captured in the input-output matrices. The waste management section was managed but the introduction to Material Flow Analysis approach which resulted with 4. 5 kg/capita/ day of solid waste for Klang Valley. The economic input-output model of a nation or region is an analytical tool that describes the structure of one nation or region’s economy. A derived matrix from the economic input-output table is expanded to express global warming potential which describes its total global warming impact relative to carbon dioxide emission over a set period of time. The estimation of carbon footprint from monetary fluxes is vital in the environmental health impact assessment as sustainable urban planning and sustainable economy are complimentary of one another. This study contributes to quantitatively analyse the physical input-output relationships among the socioeconomic components with the findings on the distribution of environmental impacts, thereby providing scientific model support to guide restructuring of metabolic system especially urban metabolic system. The use of publicly available data to assemble the matrix representation enables comprehensive assessment of the environmental impacts of a product or service with effective cost, in a relatively fast and high-technology manner...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{pleasure}} {{to comment on the}} paper by César Calderón and Klaus Schmidt-Hebbel. Typically, when economists ask the question ‘what drives inflation?’, explanations turn to <b>monetary</b> <b>factors.</b> The problem of inflation control is naturally encapsulated in the new Keynesian models such as that described in Woodford (2003) and Galí (2008). An important contribution of César and Klaus’s paper is that it highlights that just focusing on <b>monetary</b> <b>factors</b> to understand inflation is insufficient. The objective of César and Klaus’s paper is to evaluate the importance of nonmonetary factors for inflation. They classify their candidate factors into five groups – high inflation and persistence, monetary and exchange rate regimes, openness, structural variables and institutions, and business-cycle-related variables. In their study, César and Klaus use an impressive large panel dataset that consists of 97 countries over thirty years and a range of econometric approaches. They find that a disciplined monetary regime, sensible fiscal policy, and financial openness are crucial to low-inflation outcomes. They also show that globalisation – as proxie...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} main drivers of the {{agricultural}} commodity price volatility using the GARCH-MIDAS model of Engel et al. (2013), {{a new class of}} component models that allows for isolating the low-frequency component of volatility and taking into consideration macroeconomic factors via mixed data sampling. We show that modelling the agricultural price volatility as the product of high and low frequency components is more efficient than filtering it through a standard GARCH(1, 1) model. After combing wheat, corn and soybean daily prices with monthly market specific and common macroeconomic drivers over the period 1986 - 2012, it appears that supply-demand indicators and conventional speculation proxies are crucial in explaining the low-frequency component of volatility while <b>monetary</b> <b>factors</b> and energy markets play significant but less important role. Nevertheless, when we consider only the period following the recent price spikes (2006 - 2012), the <b>monetary</b> <b>factors</b> – especially interest rate – become essential to describe agricultural price fluctuations, suggesting also that the heterogeneity in the effects of the drivers on different crops is decreasing.

Working Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to further debate. This paper examines the relative importance of <b>monetary</b> <b>factors</b> and structuralist supply-side factors for inflation in Pakistan. A stylized inflation model is specified that includes standard monetary variables (money supply, credit to the private sector), the exchange rate, as well as the wheat support price as a supply-side factor that has received considerable attention in Pakistan. The model is estimated for the period January 1998 to June 2005 on a monthly basis. The results indicate that <b>monetary</b> <b>factors</b> have played a dominant role in recent inflation, affecting inflation with a lag of about one year. Changes in the wheat support price influence inflation in the short run, but not in the long run. Furthermore, the wheat suppor...|$|R
