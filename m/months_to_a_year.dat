5|$|Marriage was {{considered}} the normal state for all adult residents of the colony. Most men first married in their mid-twenties and women around age 20. Second marriages were not uncommon, and widows and widowers faced social and economic pressures to remarry. On average, most widows and widowers remarried within six <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Most adults who reached marriageable age lived into their sixties, so effectively two-thirds of a person's life was spent married.|$|E
5|$|Sixense {{developed}} {{a version of}} Portal 2 to support the Razer Hydra motion controller for PC that allows enhanced control of some game elements. Ten extra single-player levels are available as downloadable content for this version. Writer Chet Faliszek said Sixense developers spent nine <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> in-house at Valve preparing the native version. A limited edition of the Razer Hydra comes bundled {{with a copy of}} Portal 2 for PC.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his reign, Neferhotep I {{shared the}} throne with his brother Sihathor, a coregency that lasted a few <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Sihathor died shortly before Neferhotep, who {{probably}} then appointed another brother, Sobekhotep IV, as coregent. In any case, Sobekhotep IV succeeded Neferhotep I soon afterwards, and reigned over Egypt for almost a decade. The reigns of the two brothers mark the apex of the 13th Dynasty.|$|E

50|$|Unsafe {{drinking}} {{water is a}} major cause of diarrhoea, which is a major killer of young children in Indonesia. According to UNICEF diarrhoea caused by untreated {{drinking water}} contributed to the death of 31% of children between the age of 1 <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> and 25% of children between <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> 4 years old.|$|R
5|$|In contrast, Creswell, while {{referring}} to the Aphrodito Papyri, claims that Abd al-Malik's son, al-Walid I, reconstructed the Aqsa Mosque {{over a period of}} six <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> using workers from Damascus. Most scholars agree that the mosque's reconstruction was started by Abd al-Malik, but that al-Walid oversaw its completion. In 713–14, a series of earthquakes ravaged Jerusalem, destroying the eastern section of the mosque, which was subsequently rebuilt during al-Walid's rule. In order to finance its reconstruction, al-Walid had gold from the dome of the Rock minted to use as money to purchase the material. The Umayyad-built al-Aqsa Mosque most likely measured 112 x 39 meters.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2013, about 90 {{students}} held a walkout {{and protest}} in objection {{to a recent}} trend of declining enforcement of educational standards. The policy, requiring applicants to have professional kitchen experience, has varied from three <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> and is currently six months; a 2011 revision allowed front-of-house service to count for the requirement. The protesting students signed letters to teachers and the school administration, gave speeches, and donned name tags with their student loan debt written on them.|$|E
5|$|During a {{match with}} Mr. Kennedy on the October 1, 2007 episode of Raw, Cena {{suffered}} a legitimate torn pectoral muscle while executing a hip toss. Though finishing the match and {{taking part in}} the scripted attack by Orton after the match, surgery the following day found that his pectoralis major muscle was torn completely from the bone, estimating at the time to require seven <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> of rehabilitation. As a result, Cena was stripped of the title by Mr. McMahon on the next night's episode of ECW, ending what was the longest WWE Championship reign in over 19 years. Cena's surgery was performed by orthopedic surgeon James Andrews at St. Vincent's Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. Two weeks later in a video update on WWE.com, Dr. Andrews and Cena's physical trainer both said that he was several weeks ahead of where he was expected to be in his rehabilitation at that time. Despite his injury, Cena attended the annual WWE's Tribute to the Troops show filmed at Camp Speicher in Tikrit, Iraq on December 7, and aired on December 24.|$|E

5|$|Like Castile soap, {{the chief}} {{ingredients}} of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive oil, water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The compound {{is made by}} mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant (qilw) which grows {{along the banks of}} the River Jordan with locally supplied lime (sheed). The sodium compound is then heated with water and the olive oil in large copper vats over fermentation pits. The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles repeated over eight days. During that time, an oar-shaped wooden tool known as a dukshab is used to stir the liquid soap continuously. The liquid soap is then spread in wooden frames to set. After setting, it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company's trademark seal. The soap cubes then undergo a drying process which can last from three <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> and involves stacking them in ceiling-high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the cubes.|$|E
25|$|Cutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} is {{the most}} common form, which causes an open sore at the bite sites, which heals in a few <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> and half, leaving an unpleasant-looking scar.

However, since Van der Westhuizen suffered three concussions {{since the start of}} 2014, a specialist advised that he should not play any rugby for six <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> He did not pass the medical at the Eastern Province Kings and the contract was subsequently cancelled.|$|R
5000|$|There are a vast about {{of reasons}} why {{miniature}} horses may be considered <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> preferable choice of a service animal. Miniature horses may be chosen by people whose religion considers dogs to be unclean or who have serious allergies to dogs, as well as phobias. Miniature horses have average lifespans of 30- 40 years (longer than both service dog's and monkeys) and take 6 <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> of training, only done by professional trainers.|$|R

25|$|PC {{lighting}} is also high-power fluorescent lighting, but the tubes are thinner {{and are often}} folded over one another to reduce size. Most spiral-shaped energy-efficient light bulbs commercially available for house lighting are power compact fluorescent bulbs. PC bulbs are recommended to be replaced every six <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> to keep the desired light spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Withdrawal {{symptoms}} {{can emerge}} despite slow reduction {{but can be}} reduced by a slower rate of withdrawal. As a result, withdrawal rates have been recommended to be customized to each individual patient. The time needed to withdrawal can vary {{from a couple of}} <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> or more and often depends on length of use, dosage taken, lifestyle, health, and social and environmental stress factors.|$|E
25|$|Hornby created these {{buildings}} {{thanks to the}} success of their 00 gauge buildings, which they call Skaledale. Many of the buildings are the same as their Skaledale equivalent, except in different scales, to save the cost of designing a new model. They are generally released about 6 <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> behind their OO counterparts. When Hornby announced their 2010 range, Lyddle End was not mentioned, presumably ended.|$|E
30|$|The {{period of}} the {{experiment}} may vary from <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> during which the samples are constantly monitored to evaluate the carbonation rate. To achieve the best result, the carbonation tests under these circumstances are carried out under the static condition where the amount of brine/fresh water initially added to the vessel is maintained (Kutchko et al. 2008). It {{should be noted that}} employing fresh water rather than brine would accelerate the degradation of the cement due to the faster rate of CO 2 getting dissolved in fresh water.|$|R

25|$|The scars {{resulting}} from abdominoplasty are long, brutal in appearance, and permanent. The {{size of the}} scar depends {{on the amount of}} skin that has been cut off, the techniques used for the surgery, the surgeon's skills, and the body's ability to recover. Although this scar will never become invisible, it is usually placed under the swimsuit line so it is covered by clothes. It normally takes nine <b>months</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> before scars flatten out and lighten in color.|$|E
