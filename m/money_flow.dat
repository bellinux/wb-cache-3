[...] Though some speculated that Thompson would {{drop out of the}} race during the call, he instead announced his intentions to participate in the Ames Straw Poll. [...] The move reaffirmed his strategy of relying on the straw poll to propel him from the lower tier, despite moves by the campaigns of Rudy Giuliani and John McCain to withdraw from the event.

A country can balance its trade either on a trading partner basis in which total <b>money</b> <b>flows</b> between two {{countries}} are equalized or it can balance the overall trade and <b>money</b> <b>flows</b> so that a trade deficit with one country is balanced by a trade surplus with another country." ...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{studies the}} <b>money</b> <b>flows</b> {{into and out}} of {{socially}} responsible investment (SRI) funds around the world. In their investment decisions, investors in SRI funds may be more concerned with ethical or social issues than with fund performance. Therefore, SRI <b>money</b> <b>flows</b> are less related to past fund returns. Ethical money is less sensitive to past negative returns than are conventional fund flows, especially when SRI funds primarily use negative or sin/ethical screens. Social attributes of SRI funds weaken the relationship between money inflows and past positive returns. However, <b>money</b> <b>flows</b> into funds with environmental screens are more sensitive to past positive returns than are conventional fund flows. Stock picking based on in-house SRI research increases the <b>money</b> <b>flows.</b> These results give evidence on the role of nonfinancial attributes, which induce heterogeneity of investor clienteles within SRI funds. No evidence of a smart money effect is found, as the funds that receive more inflows neither outperform nor underperform their benchmarks or conventional funds. ...|$|R

"Well, in {{a family}} of the {{scientific}} temperament, it seems to me, one brother may happen to go in for butterflies--may he not?--and another for geology, or for submarine telegraphs. Now, the man who happens to take up butterflies does not make a fortune out of his hobby--there is no money in butterflies; so we say, accordingly, he is an unpractical person, who cares nothing for business, and who is only happy when he is out in the fields with a net, chasing emperors and tortoise-shells. But the man who happens to fancy submarine telegraphy most likely invents a lot of new improvements, takes out dozens of patents, finds <b>money</b> <b>flow</b> in upon him as he sits in his study, and becomes at last a peer and a millionaire; so then we say, What a splendid business head he has got, to be sure, and how immensely he differs from his poor wool-gathering brother, the entomologist, who can only invent new ways of hatching out wire-worms! Yet all may really depend on the first chance direction which led one brother as a boy to buy a butterfly net, and sent the other into the school laboratory to dabble with an electric wheel and a cheap battery." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now Tiidu saw {{quite clearly}} {{that he could}} only hope to become rich by means of his pipes, and set about {{thinking}} if {{there was nothing he}} could do to make the <b>money</b> <b>flow</b> in faster. At length he remembered having heard some stories of a kingdom in the Kungla country, where musicians of all sorts were welcomed and highly paid; but where it was, or how it was reached, he could not recollect, however hard he thought. In despair, he wandered along the coast, hoping to see some ship or sailing boat that would take him where he wished to go, and at length he reached the town of Narva, where several merchantmen were lying at anchor. To his great joy, he found that one of them was sailing for Kungla in a few days, and he hastily went on board, and asked for the captain. But the cost of the passage was more than the prudent Tiidu cared to pay, and though he played his best on his pipes, the captain refused to lower his price, and Tiidu was just thinking of returning on shore when his usual luck flew to his aid. A young sailor, who had heard him play, came secretly to him, and offered to hide him on board, in the absence of the captain. So the next night, as soon as it was dark, Tiidu stepped softly on deck, and was hidden by his friend down in the hold in a corner between two casks. Unseen by the rest of the crew the sailor managed to bring him food and drink, and when they were well out of sight of land he proceeded to carry out a plan he had invented to deliver Tiidu from his cramped quarters. At midnight, while he was keeping watch and everyone else was sleeping, the man bade his friend Tiidu follow him on deck, where he tied a rope round Tiidu's body, fastening the other end carefully to one of the ship's ropes. 'Now,' he said, 'I will throw you into the sea, and you must shout for help; and when you see the sailors coming untie the rope from your waist, and tell them that you have swum after the ship all the way from shore.' ...|$|E
