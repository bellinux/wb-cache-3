40|$|Abstract — In {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs), a good sensor deployment {{method is}} vital to the quality of service (QoS) provided by WSNs. This QoS depends on the coverage of the monitoring area. In WSNs with locomotion facilities, sensors can move around and selfdeploy to ensure coverage and load balance, where each unit of monitoring area is covered by the same number of sensors. The movement-assisted sensor deployment deals with moving sensors to meet coverage and load balance requirements. In SMART [1], various optimization problems are defined to minimize different parameters, including <b>total</b> <b>moving</b> distance, <b>total</b> number of moves, communication/computation cost, and convergence rate. In this paper, we focus on minimizing <b>total</b> <b>moving</b> distance and propose an optimal, but centralized solution, based on the Hungarian method. This solution is illustrated in an application where the monitoring area is a 2 -D grid-based mesh. We then propose several efficient, albeit non-optimal, distributed solutions based on the scan-based solution in [1]. Extensive simulations have been done to verify the effectiveness of the proposed distributed solutions.

50|$|The double motion {{technique}} halves the tripping {{speed of}} the moving part. In principle, the kinetic energy could be quartered if the <b>total</b> <b>moving</b> mass were not increased. However, as the <b>total</b> <b>moving</b> mass is increased, the practical reduction in kinetic energy is closer to 60%. The total tripping energy also includes the compression energy, which is almost the same for both techniques. Thus, {{the reduction of the}} total tripping energy is lower, about 30%, although the exact value depends on the application and the operating mechanism. Depending on the specific case, either the double motion or the single motion technique can be cheaper. Other considerations, such as rationalization of the circuit breaker range, can also influence the cost.|$|R
