40|$|Impact ejected {{rocks are}} targets for life {{detection}} missions to Mars. The Martian subsurface is more favourable to organic preservation than the surface owing to an attenuation of radiation and physical separation from oxidising materials with increasing depth. Impact events bring materials {{to the surface}} where they may be accessed without complicated drilling procedures. On Earth, different assemblages of organic matter types are derived from varying depositional environments. Here we assess whether these different types of organic materials can survive impact events without corruption. We subjected four terrestrial organic matter types to elevated pressures and temperatures in piston-cylinder experiments followed by chemical characterisation using whole-rock pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Our data reveal that long chain hydrocarbon-dominated organic matter (types I and II; mainly microbial or algal) are unresistant to pressure whereas aromatic hydrocarbondominated organic matter types (types III and IV; mainly land plant, metamorphosed or degraded, displaying some superficial chemical similarities to abiotic <b>meteoritic</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter)</b> are relatively resistant.

Here, we report the discovery of a hitherto unknown chemical class, dihydroxymagnesium carboxylates [(OH) (2) MgO 2 CR](-), in <b>meteoritic</b> soluble <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> High collision energies, which are required for fragmentation, suggest substantial thermal stability of these Mg-metalorganics (CHOMg compounds).

The appearance of this CHOMg chemical class extends the previously investigated, diverse set of CHNOS molecules. A connection between the evolution of organic compounds and minerals is made, as Mg released from minerals gets trapped into organic compounds.

40|$|International audienceThe {{presence}} of solid carbonaceous matter in cometary dust {{was established by}} the detection of elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in particles from comet 1 P/Halley 1, 2. Such matter is generally thought to have originated in the interstellar medium 3, but it might have formed in the solar nebula—the cloud {{of gas and dust}} that was left over after the Sun formed 4. This solid carbonaceous material cannot be observed from Earth, so it has eluded unambiguous characterization 5. Many gaseous organic molecules, however, have been observed 6, 7, 8, 9; they come mostly from the sublimation of ices at the surface or in the subsurface of cometary nuclei 8. These ices could have been formed from material inherited from the interstellar medium that suffered little processing in the solar nebula 10. Here we report the in situ detection of solid <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in the dust particles emitted by comet 67 P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko; the carbon in this organic material is bound in very large macromolecular compounds, analogous to the insoluble <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> found in the carbonaceous chondrite meteorites 11, 12.

40|$|A {{combination}} of NanoSIMS and High resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} (HRTEM) imaging along with Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the carbonaceous phases in HF/HCl residue of the Abee enstatite chondrite. This acid residue hosts a very D-depleted component (δD = − 480 ‰). This residue {{is a mixture of}} graphite and highly disordered insoluble <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> The latter exhibits a significant mesoporosity (i. e., 200 – 500 nm scale), and also shows concentric and elongated stacks of polyaromatic layers. Insoluble <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> is shown to be the most D-depleted component in Abee. We also determined, by using NanoSIMS, carbon isotopic composition of graphite and insoluble <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in the acid residue (δ^(13) C = − 11. 3 ± 2. 9 ‰ and − 28. 4 ± 2. 2 ‰, respectively). We identified graphite in metal-rich clasts and in the matrix of Abee, associated with enstatite, sulfide and metal, but we could not localize highly disordered <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in our section. Regardless, given the vulnerability of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> to thermal degradation, we suggest that it was added to Abee parent body during the latest stage of its formation, after any thermal metamorphism or partial melting of Abee parent body. A genetic link between <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and graphite in Abee is excluded based on our HRTEM and carbon isotopic data. The differences in carbon isotopic compositions between these phases are consistent with previous data obtained by stepwise heating experiments and indicate that graphite is not derived from a pure thermal solid-state graphitization of the <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> Rather, we suggest that graphite precipitated from a melt rich in C during the partial melting of the Abee parent body. Insoluble <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in Abee has the lowest D/H ratio among the extraterrestrial organics. Organics in most carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites are believed to have been subjected to irradiations in low temperature environments, resulting in a dramatic isotopic fractionation through exchange and reaction with gaseous molecular hydrogen during their synthesis. In contrast, Abee <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> was likely synthesized in a neutral (i. e., not ionized) environment where thermodynamic processes at equilibrium most likely controlled its isotopic composition.

40|$|The {{carbonaceous}} chondrite meteorites contain {{a record of}} the formation of the solar system, part of which is present within organic matter. This organic matter is predominantly aromatic, and its sources remain controversial. The δ 13 C values for individual free and macromolecular aromatic moieties from Cold Bokkeveld and Murchison suggest that these units originate from radiation-induced ``circle'' reactions involving simultaneous bond synthesis and cracking. Large carbon isotope fractionations and a deuterium enrichment for these entities suggest that these reactions occurred in a dense interstellar cloud. The juxtaposition of the synthesis and cracking products implies that the reactions occurred in a restricting medium, the most likely candidate for which is the icy organic mantles of interstellar grains. In contrast, the δ 13 C record in aromatic moieties from Orgueil is mostly obscured, possibly due to the increased levels of parent body aqueous alteration experienced by this meteorite.

40|$|The {{origins of}} the {{building}} blocks of the Solar System can be studied using the isotopic composition of early planetary and meteoritic material. Oxygen isotopes in planetary materials show variations at the per cent level that are not related to the mass of the isotopes rather, they result from the mixture of components having different nucleosynthetic or chemical origins. Isotopic variations reaching orders of magnitude in minute meteoritic grains are usually attributed to stellar nucleosynthesis before the birth of the Solar System, whereby different grains were contributed by different stars.

These compositions can be accounted for by one of two processes: a single exotic evolved star seeding the young Solar System, or irradiation of the circumsolar gas by high energy particles accelerated during an active phase of the young Sun.

The highest isotope anomalies occur in m-scale inclusions in the most primitive materials, such as cometary dust and the least altered carbonaceous chondrites.

A significant fraction of the insoluble polymer has a delta-D which suggests that it was made in an interstellar medium.

40|$|Abstract—The major organic {{component}} of carbonaceous chondrites is a solvent-insoluble, {{high molecular weight}} macromolecular material that constitutes at least 70 % of the total organic content in these meteorites. Analytical pyrolysis {{is often used to}} thermally decompose macromolecular <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in an inert atmosphere into lower molecular weight fragments that are more amenable to conventional organic analytical techniques. Hydropyrolysis refers to pyrolysis assisted by high hydrogen gas pressures and a dispersed catalytically-active molybdenum sulfide phase. Hydropyrolysis of meteorites has not been attempted previously although it is ideally suited to such studies due to its relatively high yields. Hydropyrolysis of the Murchison macromolecular material successfully releases significant amounts of high molecular weight PAH including phenanthrene, carbazole, fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene, perylene, benzoperylene and coronene units with varying degrees of alklyation. Analysis of both the products and residue from hydropyrolysis reveals that the <b>meteoritic</b> <b>organic</b> network contains both labile (pyrolysable) and refractory (nonpyrolysable) fractions. Comparisons of hydropyrolysis yields of Murchison macromolecular materials with those from terrestrial coals indicate that the refractory component probably consists of a network dominated by at least five- or six-ring PAH units cross-linked together.

Both types of experiments showed decreasing initial Fe-reduction rates and decreasing degrees of reduction with increasing amounts of mineral-bound <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> At similar <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> loadings, coprecipitated ferrihydrites were more reactive than ferrihydrites with adsorbed <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> The difference {{can be explained by}} the smaller crystal size and poor crystallinity of such coprecipitates. At small <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> loadings the poor crystallinity of coprecipitates led to even faster Fe-reduction rates than found for pure ferrihydrite. The amount of mineral-bound <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> also affected the formation of secondary minerals: goethite was only found after reduction of organic matter-free ferrihydrite and siderite was only detected when ferrihydrites with relatively low amounts of mineral-bound <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> were reduced. We conclude that direct contact of G. bremensis to the Fe oxide mineral surface was inhibited by attached <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> Consequently, mineral-bound <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> shall be taken into account as a factor in slowing down reductive dissolution...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{content and}} {{composition}} of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (OM) in four areas(contrast area, aquaculture area, aquatic area and sewage area) of Baiyangdian lake are studied by using physical chemistry methods. The main objective {{of the study is}} to provide theoretical data for the management of Baiyangdian lake eutrophication. Compared with contrast area, aquaculture area and aquatic area sediment shows significantly higher concentrations of total <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in sewage area. These results suggest that more serious organic pollution in the sewage area sediment. Irrespective of the higher content of total <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> the light fraction <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (LFOM) is very low in four sample stations. Heavy fraction <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (HFOM) is the dominant class among <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> composition in contrast area aquaculture area aquatic area and sewage area sediments contributing 85. 80 %, 87. 7 %, 78. 71 % and 85. 00 % respectively. These results indicate that HFOM account for most of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> while LFOM was completely decomposed. Correlation analysis of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> shows that labile <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (LOM), dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (DOM), LFOM and HFOM have remarkable positive correlation between them respectively...|$|R

Nintey composite soil samples were analysed for <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> contents. Soil texture varied from sandy loam (Light) 20 %, loam (Medium) 78 % and Clay loam (Heavy) 2 %. <b>Organic</b> <b>matter</b> was deficient in 100 % soil samples. The maximum <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> of 0. 85 % were recorded at Loona Kahuta site and minimum <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> of 0. 20 % were observed at Kahuta and Dodheli site. The average maximum <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> of 0. 70 % were observed at Loona Kahuta site.

50|$|<b>Organic</b> <b>matter</b> {{tends to}} make the soil color darker. Humus, {{the final stage of}} <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> {{breakdown}} is black. Throughout the stages of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> breakdown the colour imparted to the soil varies from browns to black. Sodium content influences the depth of colour of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and therefore the soil. Sodium causes the <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (humus) to disperse more readily and spread over the soil particles, making the soil look darker (blacker).|$|R
