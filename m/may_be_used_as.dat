5|$|At market, sand whiting is medium priced fish, sold {{fresh or}} frozen; whole and in fillet form. In abundance, sand whiting is {{moderately}} priced, with fillets being slightly more expensive. The recovery rate of fillets from whole fish is about 40%. Sand whiting <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> sashimi.|$|E
5|$|In French cuisine, Crécy soup is {{typically}} prepared with rice, {{which can also}} be served as a side dish. Rice <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> an ingredient to thicken the dish, and barley has also been used.|$|E

5|$|When a tooth is lost, dentures, bridges, or {{implants}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> replacements. Dentures {{are usually}} the least costly whereas implants {{are usually the}} most expensive. Dentures may replace complete arches of the mouth or only a partial number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants {{may be used to}} replace a single tooth or a series of teeth. Though implants are the most expensive treatment option, they are often the most desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of dentures, implants <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> support.|$|E
5|$|An ephemeral natural pool {{system is}} located in the {{vicinity}} of Scotch Run. In the past, a reservoir was created on the stream by damming it. In the 21st century, a small residential area and a number of roads are present near it. The forests and vernal pools on Scotch Run are fragmented by dirt roads. The habitat quality of the area may also be impaired by All Terrain Vehicles. Additionally, the vernal pools <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> breeding grounds for mosquitos.|$|E
5|$|Argon <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> {{the carrier}} gas in gas {{chromatography}} and in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; {{it is the}} gas of choice for the plasma used in ICP spectroscopy. Argon is preferred for the sputter coating of specimens for scanning electron microscopy. Argon gas is also commonly used for sputter deposition of thin films as in microelectronics and for wafer cleaning in microfabrication.|$|E

5|$|Avocado cake is a cake {{prepared}} using avocado as {{a primary}} ingredient, together with other typical cake ingredients. The avocados can be mashed, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> an ingredient in cake batter, in cake toppings and alone atop a cake. Cake variations include raw avocado cake, avocado brownies and avocado cheesecake. Raw, uncooked versions of avocado cake can be high in vitamin E and essential fatty acids, which are derived from avocado. Avocado-based cake toppings include avocado fool and avocado crazy.|$|E
5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection is dependent on the polarization of the incoming light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a visual signal between moths. This has not yet been studied, however.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{encryption}} key <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> part of circumvention technology forbidden by the DMCA, its possession and distribution {{has been viewed}} as illegal by the AACS, {{as well as by}} some legal professionals. Since it is a 128-bit numerical value, it was dubbed an illegal number. Opponents to the expansion of the scope of copyright criticize the idea of making a particular number illegal.|$|E

5|$|Characteristics of lava dome eruptions include shallow, long-period and hybrid seismic activity, {{which is}} {{attributed}} to excess fluid pressures in the contributing vent chamber. Other characteristics of lava domes include their spherical dome shape, cycles of dome growth over long periods, and sudden onsets of violent explosive activity. The average rate of dome growth <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a rough indicator of magma supply, but it shows no systematic relationship to the timing or characteristic of lava dome explosions.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{precipitation}} {{of sodium}} salts from aqueous solutions is rare because sodium salts typically {{have a high}} affinity for water; an exception is sodium bismuthate (NaBiO3). Because of this, sodium salts are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an organic solvent, such as ethanol; for example, only 0.35g/L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol. Crown ethers, like 15-crown-5, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a phase-transfer catalyst.|$|E
5|$|Given that FH {{is present}} from birth and {{atherosclerotic}} changes may begin early in life, {{it is sometimes}} necessary to treat adolescents or even teenagers with agents that were originally developed for adults. Due to safety concerns, many physicians prefer to use bile acid sequestrants and fenofibrate as these are licensed in children. Nevertheless, statins seem safe and effective, and in older children <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> in adults.|$|E

5|$|The Sonoran Arthropod Institute hosts {{an annual}} Invertebrates in Education and Conservation Conference {{to discuss the}} use of {{invertebrates}} in education. There also are efforts in many countries to find alternatives to using animals in education. The NORINA database, maintained by Norecopa, lists products that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> alternatives or supplements to animal use in education, and in the training of personnel who work with animals. These include alternatives to dissection in schools. InterNICHE has a similar database and a loans system.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin mostly pounces on prey on the ground, {{although}} it can swoop and catch creatures while airborne. Less often, it gleans (takes prey while perched) in low-lying vegetation, almost always less than 3m (10ft) above the ground. The prey is most commonly on the ground when caught, although airborne insects are sometimes taken. A low branch <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a vantage point in hunting.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, lard {{is used to}} fry the chicken, but corn oil, peanut oil, canola oil, or {{vegetable}} oil are also frequently used (although clarified butter <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> well like in colonial times). The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too strong {{to be used for}} traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use. There are three main techniques for frying chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> taxonomic characters. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide {{is applied to the}} cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If a drop of commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes a pale blue.|$|E
5|$|Chlordiazepoxide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but diazepam <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed {{for a short period of}} time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. Oxazepam and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.|$|E
5|$|Equines {{produce a}} number of vocalizations and noises. Loud {{snorting}} is associated with alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors will also squeal while play fighting. The contact calls of equines vary from the whinnying and nickering of the horse, the barking of plains zebras, and the braying of asses and Grévy's zebras. Equines also communicate with visual displays and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also incorporate {{the positions of the}} head, ears and tail. An equine may signal an intention to kick by laying back its ears and sometimes lashing the tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth and abrupt movement of the heads <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> threatening gestures, particularly among stallions.|$|E

50|$|Bog-wood <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in joinery to make {{furniture}} or wood carving. Bog-wood sometimes has aesthetically interesting shapes (similar to driftwood) and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> ornaments. As bog-wood dries out, it may crack or split, {{but this}} does not necessarily detract from its aesthetic qualities. Due to its natural color, it is a traditionally favored wood for the carving of dirks (bìodagan) and sgian-dubh in the Scottish Highlands.|$|R
