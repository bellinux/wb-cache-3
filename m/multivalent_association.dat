40|$|Lantana camara L. is a {{polyploid}} {{species with}} a basic chromosome number of 11 (x = l l). Chromosome association in 39 cultivars indicated the occurrence of univalents to heptavalents with bivalents predominating. <b>Multivalent</b> <b>association</b> analysis revealed the presence in South Africa of at least four different groups of L. camara at the diploid level. The potential for sexual reproduction must exist, {{at least at the}} diploid level, to account for differences in chromosomal behaviour that can only be attributed to hybridization. The possibility exists that the basic chromosome number may be lower than 11, or else postspeciation genomic evolution must have occurred. No cytogenetical correlation exists between the South African and Indian cultivars. The number of chiasmata per genome increases with an increase in the polyploid level. Most multivalents are of the chain type. Univalents during diakinesis are the result of asynapsis. Triploid and pentaploid plants display a markedly abnormal meiosis.   L. camara is a segmental allopolyploid species. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nearly {{every aspect}} of biology is {{controlled}} by non-covalent association events, but the diversity of these events is astounding. Association constants can vary over {{at least a dozen}} orders of magnitude, and timescales for these interactions range from microseconds to years. Molecular recognition events control the affinity and specificity of virtually all of these biological interactions. Remarkably, the relationships between structure and thermodynamics, and thus the basis of selectivity and affinity in these events remains poorly understood. An overarching goal of the Toone laboratory is to better understand the molecular facets of non-covalent association events in aqueous solution. In this dissertation, three model systems are explored to elucidate aspects of non-covalent binding events. Camelid-derived single domain antibodies demonstrate significant stability and unique binding properties versus conventional antibodies, and the work described herein helps rationalize the observation that these antibody domains function effectively as antigen binding agents. Early attempts to develop a model system with either lysozyme or biotin as the antigen of interest were not successful, but a model system using methotrexate as the antigen was successfully developed. High affinity binding interactions were observed at neutral pH, and interestingly these antibodies demonstrated some binding affinity for methotrexate even at more extreme pH levels. The observed changes in heat capacity and the effect of salt concentration were in accord with established literature precedents. In addition, no evidence of pH-induced destabilization of secondary single domain antibody structure was observed, even when accompanied by variation in temperature. The Toone laboratory is also working to elucidate the nature and origins of additivity in multivalent protein - ligand binding events in a number of intermolecular and intramolecular systems. The cluster glycoside effect (enhancements in binding affinity beyond what would be expected with increases in valency) has been demonstrated in a large number of protein - carbohydrate binding systems, but the molecular basis for the apparent enhancements in affinity remains unclear. The monomeric carbohydrate - binding protein Galectin- 3 (G 3) was studied as a model system for conditional multivalency to explore the origins of this effect. We completed a thorough investigation of the thermodynamics of binding between multivalent dendrimeric ligands and both the full-length and truncated proteins (carbohydrate recognition domain, CRD). Enhanced affinities were observed for multivalent interactions with full-length G 3 but not for interactions with the CRD. In addition, aggregation and precipitation was observed only in multivalent binding events with full-length G 3. Although multivalent binding can occur through an intramolecular (chelate-type) binding mode, these results are consistent with the notion that the cluster glycoside effect is driven through intermolecular bindng motifs, characterized by aggregation and precipitation. Traditionally, intramolecular (chelate-type) binding pathways are thought to be driven entropically; however, work from the Toone laboratory has demonstrated that <b>multivalent</b> <b>association</b> in several intramolecular multivalent binding systems is enthalpically favored and entropically opposed. General conclusions regarding the origins of intramolecular additivity in ligand binding are lacking, and the Src SH 2 domain was developed as a model system for exploring these concepts. The Src SH 2 domain was successfully expressed and purified, and a peptidic series of ligands was synthesized and advanced to crystallographic trials. Extensive apo-crystallization attempts were unsuccessful in producing an atomic-resolution structure, and despite optimization trials, co-crystallization of the peptidic ligands with the Src SH 2 domain also did not achieve the necessary resolution to provide structural data.

The karyotype analysis indicates that the chromosomes were generally very small. There were also slight variations in centromeric positions and arm lengths.

Chiasmata frequencies per nucleus/bivalent were analyzed at diplotene and diakinesis revealing a marked reduction of chiasmata at diakinesis as compared to diplotene. The very low terminalization value of 0. 43 showed that most of the chiasmata were terminalized at diakinesis and metaphase I. <b>Multivalent</b> <b>associations</b> were frequent suggesting the presence of a translocation heterozygote. Univalents were also of a frequent occurrence. Chromatid bridges, fragments, laggards and eliminated chromosomes were also frequent at both MI and MII. Secondary association of chromosomes occurred with a preponderance of four and eight over other groups. The occurrence of secondary associations and other aberrations were suggestive that Eichhornia crassipes is of hybrid origin. Cytological studies of Eichhornia crassipes revealed that chromosome behaviour which includes high frequency of chromatid bridges formed (42. 52 %), high percentage of univalents (15. 24 %) and the presence of phragmoplast during microsporogenesis does not influence the prolific behaviour of the plant...|$|R
40|$|Paspalum quadrifarium Lam. is a bunchgrass {{native to}} Uruguay, Argentina, and {{southern}} Brazil. Diploid, triploid, tetraploid and hexaploid cytotypes {{have been reported}} for this species of the Quadrifaria group of Paspalum. In this group, {{a high degree of}} cytogenetic homology between the genomes of several diploid species has been reported, based on meiotic pairing in interspecific hybrids; <b>multivalent</b> <b>associations</b> would thus be expected in polyploid hybrids. Karyotype analysis could provide useful information about the genomic architecture of polyploid plants; however, the fully condensed mitotic chromosomes of Paspalum do not provide enough morphological features for such an analysis. In this paper, we used mitotic prometaphase chromosomes treated with 70 % acetic acid at 40 °C after cover slip removal. This process removes cytoplasm that remains from chromosome squashes and makes prometaphases available for karyological analysis. The karyotypes of a triploid (2 n = 3 x = 30) and a tetraploid (2 n = 4 x = 40) accession of Paspalum quadrifarium were studied using this technique, and evidence of segmental allopolyploidy was found in both cases.

40|$|In this paper, {{detailed}} {{meiotic analysis}} {{was investigated in}} seven species of Curcuma (Linnaeus, 1753) which can contribute significantly to our understanding about species inter-relationship, speciation and evolution. The species {{were divided into two}} groups viz., Group I having 2 n = 42 (C. comosa Roxburgh, 1810, C. haritha Mangaly &amp; M. Sabu, 1993, C. mangga Valeton &amp; Zijp, 1917, and C. motana Roxburgh, 1800) and Group II with 2 n = 63 (C. caesia Roxburgh, 1810, C. longa Linnaeus, 1753 and C. sylvatica Valeton, 1918). Both groups display varying degree of chromosome associations. Group I species showed the prevalence of bivalents, however occasional quadrivalents besides univalents were also encountered. About 48 % of the PMCs analyzed in C. mangga showed 21 bivalents (II) meiotic configurations, 32 % in C. comosa and 16 % in C. haritha. Group II species as expected showed the presence of trivalents besides bivalents, univalents and quadrivalents. About 32 % of the PMCs analyzed at MI in C. sylvatica showed 21 trivalents (III) meiotic configurations, 24 % in C. longa and 8 % in C. caesia. Overall, low frequency of <b>multivalent</b> <b>associations</b> as compared to bivalents indicates that Curcuma is an allopolyploid complex. Moreover, x = 21 is too high a basic number, therefore, we suggest that the genus Curcuma has evolved by hybridization of species with different chromosome numbers of 2 n = 24 and 18, resulting in a dibasic amphidiploid species...|$|R
40|$|Shaker-type {{potassium}} channels play {{important roles}} in determining the electrical excitability of cells. The native channel complex {{is thought to be}} formed by four pore-forming α subunits that provide four interaction sites for auxiliary modulatory Kvβ subunits. Because Kvβ subunits possess diverse modulatory activities including either up-regulation or down-regulation of potassium currents, differential assembly of the α–β complex could give rise to diverse current properties. However, the detailed physical and functional stoichiometry of the α–β complex remains unknown. Kvβ 1 subunits reduce potassium currents through inactivation, whereas Kvβ 2 subunits enhance potassium currents by inhibiting the Kvβ 1 -mediated inactivation {{and at the same time}} by promoting the surface expression of certain potassium channels. In this report we show that Kvβ 1 and Kvβ 2 of the Shaker-type potassium channels display distinct functional stoichiometry to interact with the Kv 1 α subunits, a subfamily of Shaker-type potassium channels. The interaction of Kvβ 1 subunits with α subunits is consistent with the α 4 βn model, where n equals 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, depending upon the relative concentration of α and β subunits. The α 4 βn stoichiometry allows for gradual changes of the Kvβ 1 -mediated inactivation. In contrast, Kvβ 2 subunits self-associate to form oligomers and interact with the α subunits via α 4 β 4 stoichiometry, which permits effective <b>multivalent</b> <b>associations</b> with α subunits. Such distinct functional stoichiometry of Kvβ 1 and Kvβ 2 provides a molecular mechanism that is well suited to their contrasting activities of up-regulation or down-regulation of potassium currents...|$|R

Ultrastructural analysis of microspread nuclei revealed SCs with a well-preserved structure until late substages of prophase I, but did not detect kinetochore plates and recombination nodules. Pachytene cells of R. agamemnon, R. rochai and T. bahiensis exhibited single and unsynapsed axes continuous with totally synapsed SCs, indicating the occurrence of heterozygous chromosomal rearrangements. Although chromosome chains were not observed in T. fasciolatus, the presence of gaps and interlocks points out that this species also carries heterozygous rearrangements, involving a small chromosome segment. Especially in R. rochai, the cellular microspreading analysis was useful to clarify the origin of inter-and intraindividual variation {{in the number of}} bivalent-like elements and in the number of chromosomes involved in <b>multivalent</b> <b>associations.</b> It was found that more chromosomes were involved in rearrangements than previously established through investigations using light microscopy alone.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Brachiaria humidicola (Poaceae), {{originally}} from Africa, is an economically important pasture plant in tropical South America. An accession of B. humidicola (H 038) {{collected from the}} wild African savanna (Mbeya, Tanzania) showed irregular microsporogenesis. This meiotic behavior was consistent with an allopolyploid origin. <b>Multivalent</b> chromosome <b>association</b> at diakinesis gave tri- to octavalents, associated with two nucleoli in some cells. Six non-congregated univalents in meta-phase I and anaphase I, along with previous lines of evidence for x = 6 in B. humidicola, confirm H 038 as a nonaploid accession, 2 n = 9 x = 54. Asynchrony in the genome during microsporogenesis also corroborated this assumption. Its putative origin could be a cross between two related species with different rhythms in meiosis. The meiotic behavior of this accession reinforces the hypothesis {{of the existence of}} a new basic chro-mosome number (x = 6) for Brachiaria.

There is great interest {{in the development of}} apomictic hybrid cultivars that combine desirable genes such as resistance to spittlebugs, high nutritive value, and tolerance to acid soils. Microsporogenesis of six apomictic progenies resulting from a tetraploid (2 n = 4 x = 36) cross between B. ruziziensis × B. brizantha was evaluated under light microscopy. Genetic recombination, ensured by <b>multivalent</b> chromosome <b>association</b> and crossing-over at prophase occurred in low frequency among progenies, and in one, recombination was almost nonexistent. The percentage of meiocytes with meiotic abnormalities among progenies ranged from 16. 6 % to 85. 6 %. Besides an observed irregular chromosome segregation typical of polyploid hybrids in these five progenies, putative meiotic mutations characterized as desynapsis and divergent spindle organization occurred in three progenies. These anomalies caused frequent fractionation of the genome into several microspores of different sizes. In Brachiaria, new cultivars must be apomictic to fix the genotype. However, Brachiaria is a pseudogamous apomict, and viable gametes are necessary to produce viable seeds.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of germplasm {{of the wild}} species in sweet-potato breeding has been conducted {{for the last three}} decades. Such attempts brought some remarkable achievments in improving root yield, starch content and resistance to the nematodes of sweet potato. Some wild plants in polyploid series may have many genes potentially important for further improvement of the agronomic traits. However, the genomic relationship between the wild relatives and hexaploid sweet potato (2 n= 6 x= 90) has been unrevealed. Meiotic studies were carried out on the hexaploids synthesized with diploids and tetraploids and on the F_ 1 hybrids, when possible, with sweet potato. Chromosomes in pollen mother cells (PMC's) and root tip cells were fixed in New-comer's solution and stained according to Feulgen reaction with Schiff's reagent. The present report was concerned wlth two kinds of the synthetic hexaploids. The first was the hexaploids derived from chromosome doubling of triploid hybrids between Ipomoea lacunosa (K 61, 2 n= 30) and I. tiliacea (K 134, 2 n= 60). the synthetic hexaploid exhibited mostly regular meiosis with bivalents at the metaphase I stage (MI), and it was considered an allo- or segmental allo-hexaploid. The synthetic hexaploids were fertile, but failure in obtaining hybrids by crosses with sweet potato suggested a critical reproductive barrier between them. The second synthetic hexaploids with 2 x I, trifida (K 221, 2 n= 30) and 4 x I,trifida (K 233, 2 n= 60) showed the chromosome configurations characterized by the occurrence of tetravalents and hexavalents. Such <b>multivalent</b> <b>associations,</b> high in frequency and number per cell, suggested the presence of the genomes at least in quadruplicate. Similar pattern of the chromosome configura-tions was observed in a cultivar of sweet potato and the F_ 1 hybrid between the synthetic hexaploid and sweet potato. Consequently, the genomic formula for sweet potato was proposed as B 1 B 1 B 2 B 2 B 2 B 2, in which B 1 B 1 was given to 2 x I. trifida and B 2 B 2 B 2 B 2 to 4 x I. trifida. However, it is necessary to clarify the degree of homology between B 1 and B 2 genomes for more conclusive genomic constitution of sweet potato.

40|$|Comparisons {{were made}} between {{two kinds of}} tetraploids derived from the hybrid Lolium temulentum x L. perenne. One hybrid behaves like an {{autotetraploid}} with multivalents at first metaphase of meiosis in pollen mother cells. The other behaves like an allotetraploid, in which pairing at first metaphase is restricted to bivalents comprised of strictly homologous chromosomes. The ?diploidisation? of the latter form is controlled by determinants located on both the normal, A chromosomes and on supernumary B chromosomes. Reconstruction of synaptonemal complexes and their elements, from serial sections through pollen mother cell nuclei examined under the electron microscope, reveals that at zygotene pairing in both forms results in multivalent formation involving non-homologous as well as homologous chromosomes. The mechanism responsible for the diploidisation is, therefore, not based on a restriction of pairing at early meiosis to homologous chromosomes but on a ?correction? or transformation of the <b>multivalent</b> chromosome <b>associations</b> to bivalents subsequent to zygotene. The transformation is not completed until late pachytene. In the multivalent-forming tetraploid a maximum of four chromosomes are associated at first metaphase. Yet configurations of a higher valency are found at zygotene. There is, therefore, a partial transformation of multivalents even in this autotetraploid form which restricts configurations at metaphase I to homologous and homoeologous chromosomes only. In both hybrids some homologous bivalents are not the product of resolution of multivalents but result from two-by-two pairing {{from the beginning of}} zygotene. Peer reviewe...|$|R

This species is endemic to Brazilian fauna and belongs to the family Buthidae, which is considered phylogenetically basal within the order Scorpiones. In the sample examined, four sympatric and distinct diploid numbers were observed: 2 n = 5, 2 n = 6, 2 n = 9, and 2 = 10. The origin of this remarkable chromosome variability was attributed to chromosome fissions and/or fusions, considering that the decrease in chromosome number was concomitant with the increase in chromosome size and vice versa. The LM and TEM analyses showed the presence of chromosomes without localised centromere, the lack of chiasmata and recombination nodules in male meiosis, and two nucleolar organiser regions carrier chromosomes. Furthermore, male prophase I cells revealed <b>multivalent</b> chromosome <b>associations</b> and/or unsynapsed or distinctly associated chromosome regions (gaps, less-condensed chromatin, or loop-like structure) that were continuous with synapsed chromosome segments. All these data permitted us to suggest that the chromosomal rearrangements of T. bahiensis occurred in a heterozygous state. A combination of various factors, such as correct disjunction and balanced segregation of the chromosomes involved in complex meiotic pairing, system of achiasmate meiosis, holocentric nature of the chromosomes, population structure, and species dispersion patterns, could have contributed to the high level of chromosome rearrangements present in T. bahiensis.

40|$|Meiosis is {{a process}} which occurs in sexually {{reproducing}} organisms to halve the genetic complement prior to fertilisation. During meiosis a single round of DNA replication is followed by two successive rounds of chromosome segregation and cell division. The meiotic pathway in plants is complex from multiple perspectives. From a mechanical view; prior to the first meiotic division the chromosomes must replicate during meiotic interphase, then while retaining sister chromatid cohesion the homologous chromosomes must align, physically synapse and also concomitantly recombine (with the majority of sites being non-randomly positioned). Further complexities arise in allopolyploids such as bread wheat, which contains three very similar genomes from slightly diverged progenitors. Despite having homoeologous chromosomes present in the same nucleus, bread wheat displays diploid-like behaviour during meiosis I. Such an involved physical process as meiosis also has complexity reflected in the transcriptome and proteome, whether the organism be a simple eukaryote such as yeast, or a more complex eukaryote such as bread wheat. Initially, this study utilised whole genome approaches to identify novel genes that could be involved in early meiosis, focusing on bread wheat in particular. Analysis of the wheat meiotic transcriptome over seven stages of anther development identified at least 1, 350 transcripts which displayed meiotic regulation. The expression profiles of a subset of selected transcripts were analysed with Q-PCR and found to correlate strongly to those obtained in the microarray. Available meiotic transcriptome data from rice was compared to the wheat data, which enabled the identification of similar sequences, many previously unidentified, which also displayed meiotic regulation. Selected candidate genes from the microarray study were also mapped in bread wheat. This data was combined with available literature and approximately 70 % of candidate meiotic loci were located on chromosome group 3 or 5, which historically {{has been shown to}} contain multiple loci involved in chromosome pairing control. One of the candidates located on chromosome group 3, a plant-specific mismatch repair gene, Triticum aestivum MSH 7 (TaMSH 7), has previously been speculated to suppress homoeologous chromosome associations. Independent transgenic wheat plants produced using RNA interference (RNAi) were functionally characterised to ascertain a greater understanding of the role TaMSH 7 has during early meiosis in bread wheat. Localisation of a synaptonemal complex-associated protein (TaASY 1) displayed subtle abnormalities in these mutants when compared to wild-type. Feulgen staining of meiotic chromosomes at metaphase I in these mutants revealed some interlocking and <b>multivalent</b> <b>associations.</b> These results suggest that TaMSH 7 may be linked to the mechanism underlying the phenotype that is observed in the ph 2 a/ph 2 b mutant, however further research still needs to be conducted to conclusively demonstrate that this is the case. A component of the research presented in this study was performed in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana due to the limitations of bread wheat. Extensive mutant banks and a sequenced genome have aided a decade of meiotic research in Arabidopsis and the identification of close to 50 meiotic genes. One of these, AtMER 3, has been shown to control the non-random location of well above half of the recombination events that occur in many species. AtMER 3 was localised in meiotic nuclei in wild-type Arabidopsis and found to form foci on freshly synapsed regions of chromosomes in quantities far in excess of the average number of crossovers, indicating that AtMER 3 does not localise exclusively to sites of crossovers. AtMER 3 localisation was also analysed in several mutant backgrounds and found to act in an AtSPO 11 -dependent manner. However, AtMER 3 loading onto meiotic chromosomes was not affected in Atrad 51, Atdmc 1 or Atmsh 5 mutant backgrounds. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Spermatogonial and/or oogonial metaphase cells of these buthids showed diploid numbers range from 2 n = 6 to 2 n = 28. in most species, <b>multivalent</b> chromosome <b>associations</b> were observed in pachytene and postpachytene nuclei. Moreover, intraspecific variability associated with {{the presence or absence of}} chromosome chains and the number of chromosomes in the complex meiotic configurations was observed in some species of these three genera. Silver-impregnated cells revealed that the number and location of nucleolar organiser regions (NORs) remained unchanged despite extensive chromosome variation; notably, two NORs located on the terminal or subterminal chromosome regions were commonly observed for all species. C-banded and fluorochrome-stained cells showed that species with conspicuous blocks of heterochromatin exhibited the lowest rate of chromosomal rearrangement. Based on the investigation of mitotic and meiotic cells, we determined that the intraspecific variability occurred as a consequence of fission/fusion-type chromosomal rearrangements in Ananteris and Tityus species and reciprocal translocation in Rhopalurus species. Furthermore, we verified that individuals presenting the same diploid number differ in structural chromosome organisation, giving rise to intraspecific differences of chromosome association in meiotic cells (bivalent-like elements or chromosome chains).
