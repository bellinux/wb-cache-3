40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} new method of motor fault detection. ML Estimation is {{proposed}} {{as a key}} technique for signal processing. The stator current is used data for motor fault analysis. ML Estimation is generally applied to estimate signals for nonlinear model. The expectation is that the method can provide information for fault analysis. The method is tested on 3 different motor conditions: healthy, stator fault, and rotor fault <b>motor</b> at <b>full</b> <b>load</b> condition. Based on experiments, the method can differentiate conditions clearly and be also able to measure fault severity levels...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Motor Power Controller, {{also known as the}} Power Factor Controller, is to improve power factor and reduce power {{dissipation}} in induction <b>motors</b> operating below <b>full</b> <b>load.</b> These purposes were studied and tested in detail. The Motor Power Controller is capable of raising power factors from 0. 2 to 0. 8 and results in energy savings. It was found that many motors, in their present operating applications, are classified as unstable. The electronic nature of the controller vs. the electrical nature of the motor, compound this problem due to the differences in response time of the two devices. Many tests were successfully completed, the most indicating greater savings than anticipated. Also, there was an effect on efficiency which {{was not included in the}} calculations...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 7 - 16 The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} how computer simulation was used to size the main starter motors for single shaft gas turbine driven compressor strings used in a large LNG plant. The paper describes how the components of the system were modelled and discusses assumptions used in the calculations. The paper presents the actual computer output plots showing the predicted torque loading on the motor and the contributions of each of the components in the string to this predicted loading. The simulation program was also used to predict the loading of the <b>motor</b> during a <b>full</b> <b>load</b> test at the compressor vendor's facility. A torquemeter was used to measure the output of the motor during the string acceleration. The paper presents the results of the simulation prediction for the test runs and correlates the actual test measurements to the prediction...|$|R
40|$|Electric motor {{manufacturers}} are under increasing pressure through public demand {{to produce more}} efficient machine designs. The growing cost of fossil fuels and an increased {{awareness of the need}} to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have forced many manufacturers to develop new and innovative motors which offer high reliability and vastly greater operating efficiencies. This thesis investigates the design of a prototype permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) suitable for use in submersible pumping applications. A PMSM offers excellent potential to increase motor efficiency as, unlike conventional induction and synchronous motors, the rotor is (theoretically) not subjected to any copper losses. The Infolytica Corporation's 'Magnet' finite element analysis software was used to design, simulate and evaluate a line start six inch PMSM and a six inch conventional induction motor. Prior to designing the new motors, the software's accuracy and suitability was assessed by simulating a pre-existing induction motor. It was found that Magnet accurately modelled a real world motor with only minor, quantifiable, errors. Most notably, the software's lack of ability to fully model three dimensional objects and account for machine iron and other stray losses led to an almost constant overestimation of machine efficiency. A prototype six inch 1 kW standard induction motor and a 1 kW PMSM were designed and simulated. Magnet simulation results indicated that the PMSM was 14 % more efficient than the induction <b>motor</b> at <b>full</b> <b>load</b> and was capable of line starting from all initial rotor positions. Plans for both motors were compiled and construction of both is expected to begin in the near future. Physical testing of both machines and further development of the PMSM motor for commercial applications is discussed...|$|R
