This paper examines the <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> of disputes in the {{construction industry}} and it further identifies the effects disputes have on projects and investigate the forms of minimizing the disputes and how to resolve them. This study was conducted through the use of secondary data from the use of journals, books and internet to achieve the objective for the study. The review of literature looked into details the different views from different scholars about the causes of disputes then deduce from those views the <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> the <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> of dispute in the South Africa construction sector. The findings from the literature review showed that the <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> of disputes revolve around people, process and project characteristics. It was also mostly mentioned that project uncertainty, contractual problems and opportunistic behaviour cause construction disputes. The purpose of this academic paper was to justify the need to know the <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> of disputes in the South African construction industry and to further establish the effects disputes have on construction and to suggest ways to minimize and resolve disputes in projects. It is said that the people, process and projects characteristics are <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> of disputes and so is the project uncertainty, contractual problems and opportunistic behaviours. As a way to resolve disputes, alternative dispute resolutions are put in place and so are adjudication, arbitration and litigation...|$|R

5|$|A second <b>major</b> <b>cause</b> of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E

A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria are a <b>major</b> <b>cause</b> of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease {{may only be}} discovered many years after, {{as was the case}} with Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} and isolate the <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> of delays in underground lateral development at AngloGold Ashanti (AGA), Obuasi Mine, Ghana. It uses fishbone analysis to identify and present 20 possible causes of delays in lateral development at the mine. By employing Pareto analysis, 7 <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> of delays have been isolated. They are: scoop problems, low compressed air, labour shortages, bad ground, flood, power outages and waste pass getting full. The study concludes that, should management concentrate in minimising the 7 <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> of delays, it will be solving about 80 % of the problems associated with delays in underground lateral development at AGA, Obuasi mine. The study further gives specific recommendations to reduce delays in lateral development at the mine...|$|R

As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.|$|E

In addition, changes to public policy and safety laws can be made; these include speed limits, seat belt and helmet laws, and road engineering practices.|$|E

5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether to prescribe an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by bacterial infection. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the <b>major</b> <b>cause</b> of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the evolution of the burden of disease in Cuba for 20 <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> at five year intervals from 1990 to 2005, in terms of mortality and years of life lost due to premature death (YLL), using national mortality registries. Six summary measures were computed for each of the 20 <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> of death which characterized the evolution of the disease burden over the period studied. The 20 causes were then grouped according to their behaviour in these summary measures; hierarchical cluster analysis was used to support this grouping process. We compute YLL results with and without age-weighting and time discounting (3 %). The 20 <b>major</b> <b>causes</b> were grouped into 12 subgroups, each with a particular pattern. The burden of disease in Cuba during the period 1990 - 2005 has a peculiar pattern that does not reproduce the one characteristic of other low- and middle-income countries. The approach used in this study supports a better description of mortality and YLL trends for <b>major</b> <b>causes,</b> for identifying possible explanations, and for supporting public health policy making. It seems convenient to reproduce this analysis using shorter time intervals, e. g. annually...|$|R
