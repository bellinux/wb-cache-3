5|$|His {{increasing}} interest in <b>mineralogy</b> {{at this time}} is also apparent from the titles of two books he authored between 1803 and 1809. The first was a two volume work that appeared in 1804 entitled A Practical Essay on the Analysis of Minerals, which was reissued in 1808 as A Manual of Analytical <b>Mineralogy.</b> In 1809 he published Analysis of a Course of Lectures on <b>Mineralogy.</b> Beginning in 1808, while at the Surrey Institution, Accum also published, {{a series of articles}} on the chemical properties and composition of mineral water in Alexander Tilloch's Philosophical Journal.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{emission}} spectroscopy {{is useful for}} identifying <b>mineralogies</b> including carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates. Each of these groups of minerals has a distinct emissivity profile that allows for general identification (e. g., carbonate). Laboratory data are being collected that suggest the potential for determining specific composition of these minerals (e. g., calcite, magnesite). Previous studies of Mars suggest that the above groups of minerals should be present. On Mars fine-grained <b>mineralogies</b> {{are likely to be}} intimately mixed due to aeolian activity. Mixtures of calcite with palagonite will be studied to determine the volume percent requirement for salt identification and to understand the complexities of fine-grained mixtures observed by thermal emission.

Endress has quantified the <b>mineralogy</b> of clasts and sand-sized particles from samples in the sediment, and has determined that the <b>mineralogy</b> of several of the trachytic clasts is very similar to that in the overlying lava flow, including the minerals clinopyroxene, magnetite, alkali feldspar, and aenigmatite. Endress has also found small lenses of pristine basaltic glass, which could have derived from the Pillow Ridge subglacial mound near Mount Edziza.|$|E

40|$|Analytical {{electron}} microscopy observations establish that olivine is abundant and the predominant silicate phase in three interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) from the 'olivine' infrared spectra category. Two of the particles have microstructures resembling those of most nonhydrous chondritic IDPs, consisting of micron to submicron grains {{together with a}} matrix composed of amorphous carbonaceous material and sub- 500 A grains. In addition to olivine these particles respectively contain enstatite and magnetite, and pentlandite plus Ca-rich clinopyroxene. The third IDP consists mostly of olivine and pyrrhotite {{with little or no}} matrix material. Olivine grains in this particle contain prominent solar-flare ion tracks with densities corresponding to a space-exposure age between 1000 to 100, 000 years. Although the three particles have olivine-rich <b>mineralogies</b> in common, other aspects of their <b>mineralogies</b> and microstructures suggest that they experienced different formation histories. The differences between the particles indicate that the olivine infrared spectral category is a diverse collection of IDPs that probably incorporates several genetic groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetization}} {{of fresh}} natrocarbonatite lavas from Oldoinyo Lengai in Tanzania {{is dominated by}} small amounts of single- or pseudo-single-domain grains of a spinel in the solid solution series jacobsite (MnFe 2 O 4) -magnetite (Fe 3 O 4). Although this phase may acquire TRM before carbonatite lava crust has ceased being mobile, the Oldoinyo Lengai samples are good palaeomagnetic recorders of the field they cooled in. In comparison, samples from older carbonatites in Tanzania have very different magnetic <b>mineralogies</b> and unstable behaviour of remanent magnetization. There are two possible explanations for the contrast in magnetic properties. Recrystallization of fresh carbonatites during weathering may destroy the original remanence and lead {{to the production of}} various authigenic magnetic minerals. Alternatively, the different magnetic <b>mineralogies</b> may derive from distinct types of carbonatite magmas. Some older calcitic carbonatites may have associated magnetic anomalies that could be useful in prospecting for economically valuable minerals often associated with carbonatites...|$|R
