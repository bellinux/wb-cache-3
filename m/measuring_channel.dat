DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The micro-fluidic {{arrangement for}} detecting chemical, biochemical molecules and/or particles contained in liquid samples, comprises <b>measuring</b> <b>channel</b> (1) for {{the flow of the}} liquid, barrier elements (2) arranged on the <b>measuring</b> <b>channel,</b> and a heat exchanger. The barrier elements change the direction of flow of a part of the liquid sample, so that a part of the liquid sample does not flow parallelly to the longitudinal axis of the <b>measuring</b> <b>channel.</b> On bottom of the <b>measuring</b> <b>channel</b> a catcher molecules and/or catcher substances are immobilized in stripes shaped manner. The barrier elements are arranged in an interval in an angle of 1 - 90 degrees in reference to the longitudinal axis of the <b>measuring</b> <b>channel</b> and are not led across the entire width of the <b>measuring</b> <b>channel.</b> Between the barrier elements and the bottom of the <b>measuring</b> <b>channel,</b> a free gap, by which a part of the liquid sample flows, is trained. A heated liquid is led through the heat exchanger. The heat exchanger is formed with a Peltier element or controllable heating element. The <b>measuring</b> <b>channel</b> is sealed by a vacuum seal. The detection takes place optically and mass sensitively. Surface plasmones are stimulated during the detection. The arrangement keeps a constant internal pressure. The barrier elements alternately coming from the side edge of the <b>measuring</b> <b>channel,</b> are built and a front side end of barrier elements is arranged at the opposite side edge in a distance, so that a part of the liquid sample flows through the <b>measuring</b> <b>channel</b> with constantly changing direction of flow or flows through a meander shaped manner. USE - For detecting chemical, biochemical molecules and/or particles contained in liquid samples (claimed) such a rinsing liquid or buffer solution. ADVANTAGE - The arrangement achieves a high binding rate of analytes according to preimmobilized specific captures, thus avoiding measurement error and increasing sensitivity and safety of the analysis. This arrangement requires small volume of liquid samples, thus leading reduction of costs...|$|E
