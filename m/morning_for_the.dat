5|$|The mass {{deportation}} of Jews {{from the}} Warsaw Ghetto began on 22 July 1942 {{with the first}} shipment of 6,000 people. The gas chambers started operation the following <b>morning.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> next two months, deportations from Warsaw continued {{on a daily basis}} via two shuttle trains (the second one, from 6 August 1942), each carrying about 4,000 to 7,000 people crying for water. No other trains were allowed to stop at the Treblinka station. The first daily trains came in the early morning, often after an overnight wait, and the second, in mid-afternoon. All new arrivals were sent immediately to the undressing area by the Sonderkommando squad that managed the arrival platform, and from there to the gas chambers. According to German records, including the official report by SS Brigadeführer Jürgen Stroop, 265,000 Jews were transported in freight trains from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka during the period from 22 July to 12 September 1942.|$|E
5|$|By {{early summer}} 1871, Morris began {{to search for}} a house outside London where his {{children}} could spend time away from the city's pollution. He settled on Kelmscott Manor in the village of Kelmscott, Oxfordshire, obtaining a joint tenancy on the building with Rossetti in June. Morris adored the building, which was constructed circa 1570, and would spend much time in the local countryside. Conversely, Rossetti would be unhappy at Kelmscott, and eventually suffered a mental breakdown. Morris divided his time between London and Kelmscott, however when Rossetti was there he would not spend more than three days at a time at the latter. He was also fed up with his family home in Queen Square, deciding to obtain a new house in London. Although retaining a personal bedroom and study at Queen Square, he relocated his family to Horrington House in Turnham Green Road, West London, in January 1873. This allowed him to be far closer to the home of Burne-Jones, with the duo meeting on almost every Sunday <b>morning</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of Morris' life.|$|E

5|$|The French ships took shelter at {{the heavily}} {{fortified}} Iles Saint-Marcouf, sailing the following <b>morning</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> anchorage at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue. For two days the British frigates kept watch, until two ships {{of the line}} from the blockade of Cherbourg, HMS Donegal and HMS Revenge, arrived. On 15 November, the British squadron attacked the anchored French ships, which were defended by shore batteries at La Hougue and Tatihou. After four attempts to close with the French the British squadron, under heavy fire, withdrew. During the night, the British commander, Captain Pulteney Malcolm, sent his ship's boats close inshore to attack the French ships with Congreve rockets, a newly issued weapon. None are recorded as landing on target, but by morning both frigates {{had been forced to}} change position, becoming grounded on the shore. The French ships were later refloated, and Malcolm's squadron maintained the blockade until 27 November when Amazone successfully escaped back to Le Havre. The damaged Elisa remained at anchor until 6 December, when an attack by a British bomb vessel forced the frigate to move further inshore, becoming grounded once more. Elisa remained in this position until 23 December, when the boats of Diana entered the anchorage at night and set the beached ship on fire, destroying her.|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{commercial and}} critical reception. It reached a peak position of number three on Billboard Classical Albums chart and remains the Oregon Symphony's best-selling album as of 2013. In his review for Deseret News, music critic William S. Goodfellow wrote that each work contained [...] "sophistication and substance". Goodfellow said of Schwanter's composition: [...] "The more exotic scoring... {{as well as}} Schwantner's minimalistic treatment of the music's more militant episodes, gives it a drive and dramatic punch of its own." [...] The album features Raymond Bazemore as narrator; Goodfellow described Bazemore's [...] "occasionally sing-song narration" [...] in New <b>Morning</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> World as [...] "Lincolnesque". He wrote that Flagello's work contained [...] "writing of remarkable clarity and Italianate warmth", but thought Bazemore's voice sounded hoarse towards the end and preferred the solo sections in New <b>Morning</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> World. The Seattle Times Melinda Bargreen called the album [...] "strong and emotionally convincing", and praised [...] "excellent performances with strong soloists". She wrote that both works were composed in [...] "styles that are distinctively modern, but tonal and accessible". Bargreen described Bazemore's voice as [...] "deeply affecting" [...] and complimented DePreist for conducting [...] "with an obvious passion for the music, drawing remarkably detailed and virtuosic performances from his orchestra." [...] Tim Smith of the Sun-Sentinel said both works were [...] "well worth hearing" [...] and encouraged orchestras to explore the pieces, along with works by other African-American composers, to provide the public with broader programming. Smith described New <b>Morning</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> World as [...] "remarkably lyrical" [...] and [...] "quite dramatic"; he found Bazemore's sing-song narration to be [...] "too affected" [...] but found the conclusion [...] "touching" [...] and complimented the orchestra for its overall [...] "sturdy, communicative" [...] performance. Smith called Flagello's score [...] "unabashedly romantic" [...] and described as effective the work of Bazemore, DePreist and the orchestra.|$|E
500|$|New <b>Morning</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> World, {{composed}} in 1982 on commission from AT, premiered on January 15, 1983 (King's birthday) at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts; David Effron conducted the Eastman Philharmonia, and Willie Stargell, then first baseman and team {{captain of the}} Pittsburgh Pirates, served as narrator. Schwantner selected words from public speeches by King that spanned {{more than a decade}} of his life. In the album's liner notes, program annotator and classical music radio host Jim Svejda described the work as having [...] "equal parts" [...] for the orchestra and the speaker, with King's words [...] "supported and illuminated by an orchestra fabric of unusual variety and flexibility". Music critics compared Schwantner's composition to Aaron Copland's Lincoln Portrait because of its prominent narrative passages and its [...] "broad and lyrical scoring that sounds unmistakably American". In describing the work, Melinda Bargreen of The Seattle Times wrote that percussion and [...] "soaring" [...] strings helped to emphasize King's orations. New <b>Morning</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> World contains text from the following speeches and writings by King: [...] "Stride Toward Freedom" [...] (1958), [...] "Behind the Selma March" [...] (1965), and [...] "Letter from Birmingham Jail" [...] (1963); the composition ends with King's [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech.|$|E

Several audience members failed to realise that he was being tongue in cheek.|$|E

Between March and November every year, when episodes of The Simpsons were being recorded, Roswell had to fly back to Los Angeles twice a week to attend the table reads and the recording sessions.

500|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race [...] two on Friday, {{and one on}} Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90minutes; the third session, on Saturday morning, lasted for an hour. The first session was held on a dry track under cloudy skies; Massa was fastest {{with a time of}} 1:47.284, just quicker than his Ferrari teammate Räikkönen. The McLarens of Hamilton and Kovalainen, Alonso, Webber, Bourdais and Vettel completed the top eight. Light rain during the second session grew momentarily heavier halfway through, forcing the teams to switch to their wet set-ups. Hamilton led for most of the running, before Alonso, Massa and Kovalainen set faster times late in the session on a drying track. Räikkönen, Piquet, Coulthard, Bourdais and Webber all had off-track excursions with little damage done; a Fisichella spin at Stavelot forced the session to be halted for ten minutes while the debris was removed and water was cleared from the track. Conditions had not improved by the following <b>morning</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> start of the final period of practice, but a drying track late in the session allowed Heidfeld to record the best time, a 1:47.876, ahead of Kovalainen, Alonso, Hamilton, Massa, Vettel and Räikkönen.|$|E

Minaj, while interviewed on ABC's Nightline show, apologized for the incident and denied that she intentionally sought to expose herself on live television as a publicity stunt. The incident soaked protest from the Parents Television Council. President of the PTC president Tim Winter stated, [...] "the Parents Television Council has something to say about Nicki Minaj's wardrobe malfunction this <b>morning.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> umpteenth time in recent memory a morning news show has included inappropriate content for children and families."
