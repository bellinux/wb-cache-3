McNamara stayed with the survivor while Inkpen went to summon help. After several hours, ambulance crews arrived and administered first-aid and morphia. Rescue workers constructed a stretcher using saplings, bandages and overcoats. They covered the survivor with an overcoat and carried him for two hours to cover about two <b>miles</b> <b>through</b> thickly wooded country to McNamara's utility truck, which then carried him and his rescuers to a waiting ambulance.|$|E

5|$|Mahanoy Creek enters Northumberland County in East Cameron Township. It flows westward for {{a number}} of <b>miles</b> <b>through</b> a valley with Line Mountain to the south and Mahanoy Mountain to the north. The creek passes under Pennsylvania Route 125 in this valley. The creek passes into West Cameron Township, flowing west and goes through the {{township}} for several miles. It then flows into Little Mahanoy Township. After a short distance, it leaves behind the Line Mountain/Mahanoy Mountain valley and picks up Zerbe Run. Mahanoy Creek then turns southwest and passes by Dornsife before cutting through a gap between Little Mountain and Line Mountain and exiting Little Mahanoy Township. At this point, the creek enters Jackson Township and picks up Schwaben Creek, its last tributary, after some distance. Mahanoy Creek then meanders west to its mouth on the Susquehanna River north of Herndon and ten miles south of Sunbury.|$|E
5|$|Popular myth {{has it that}} a US Army {{airplane}} {{had flown}} over Villalba {{on the day of}} the invasion and dropped a yellow silk foulard marked with a black L (indicating Luciano). Two days later, three American tanks rolled into Villalba after driving thirty <b>miles</b> <b>through</b> enemy territory. Don Calogero climbed aboard and spent the next six days traveling through western Sicily organizing support for the advancing American troops. As General Patton's Third Division moved onward the signs of its dependence on Mafia support were obvious to the local population. The Mafia protected the roads from snipers, arranged enthusiastic welcomes for the advancing troops, and provided guides through the confusing mountain terrain.|$|E

25|$|The rains had {{flooded the}} Lugton Water, which {{ran around the}} Lists on three sides. No {{carriages}} could cross it, so the entire audience, apart from Eglinton's personal guests, was stranded without transportation.

25|$|The next day, funeral rites for King {{were held}} in his {{hometown}} of Atlanta, Georgia. The service at Ebenezer Baptist Church was nationally televised, as were these other events.

A second service was held there before the burial.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{lifeboats}} was regained and Captain Lean, {{joined by}} Seaman Donnelly and Engineer Kale rowed four passengers two <b>miles</b> <b>through</b> the storm-tossed water and deposited them safely at the shore. The three men made this trip twice more, rescuing {{all of the}} remaining passengers, but the final death toll, seven crew members and two passengers, made it the worst sternwheeler disaster on Kootenay Lake. The City of Ainsworth sank in 360 feet of water and its wreckage would not be discovered until 1990, nearly a century later. Once discovered the wreck was designated an underwater heritage site.|$|E

Sheridan Road begins in Chicago, continues mostly along the shoreline of Lake Michigan for about 96km (60 <b>miles)</b> <b>through</b> the North Shore suburbs, and leads to the Town of Fort Sheridan and ultimately Racine, Wisconsin. The landmark former U.S. Army base named for the general is now a reserve post and upscale residential community.|$|E
25|$|In his 50s, Vesey was a {{well-established}} carpenter {{with his own}} business. He reportedly planned the insurrection to take place on Bastille Day, July 14, 1822. This date was notable {{in association with the}} French Revolution, which had first abolished slavery in Saint-Domingue. News of the plan was said to be spread among thousands of blacks throughout Charleston and for tens of <b>miles</b> <b>through</b> plantations along the Carolina coast. (Both the city and county populations were majority black; Charleston in 1820 had a population of 14,127 blacks and 10,653 whites.) Within the black population was a growing upper class of free people of color or mulattos, some of whom were slaveholders. Vesey generally aligned with slaves.|$|E

Through Altay, NY226 is a two-lane residential street before leaving just after Bigelow Hill Road.|$|E
25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in â€“ thereâ€™s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldnâ€™t have sought out a band like that. I wasnâ€™t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians â€“ you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like itâ€™s just gonna completely break apart going 700 <b>miles</b> <b>through</b> the sky and then all of a sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E
