50|$|There {{are some}} 780 vessels {{including}} 70 midget submarines (including the Yono-class submarine and Sang-O-class submarine), 20 Romeo-class submarines, and about 140 <b>air</b> <b>cushioned</b> landing <b>craft.</b>|$|R
25|$|On 12 July 2005, ROKS Dokdo (LPH 6111), {{the lead}} ship of her class, was {{launched}} at the shipyard of Hanjin Heavy Industries in Busan. She {{was delivered to}} the South Korean navy in July, 2007. The first <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> landing <b>craft</b> (ROKS LSF 631) of LSF-II project was delivered for ROKS Dokdo in April, 2007.|$|R
50|$|The Type 724 Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC) is {{the first}} {{indigenous}} <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> landing <b>craft</b> in operational use with People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), and it origin dates {{all the way back}} in the early 1960s, when 7th Academy was assigned to lead the developmental work on <b>air</b> <b>cushioned</b> vehicles for a 10-year plan lasting from 1963 to 1972. Two projects developed from this research work, and Type 724 LCAC is the direct descendant of these two research projects.|$|R
50|$|The ships first {{assignment}} was to deliver three <b>Air</b> <b>Cushioned</b> Landing <b>Craft</b> (LCAC) to Camp Pendleton, California from Panama City, Florida. Along the way, Rushmore conducted a port visit in Jamaica, traversed the Panama Canal, and visited Rodman, Panama. Camp Pendleton {{was the last}} stop before arriving at her homeport of NS San Diego. During her first six-month deployment, Rushmore spearheaded the beach landing on Somalia during Operation Restore Hope. The largest military humanitarian operation in history, Restore Hope was designed to provide food and medical relief to the starving people of Somalia.|$|R
50|$|USS Belleau Wood ESG (March 2004). USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3) was {{the third}} ship of the Tarawa-class Amphibious Assault and Command ships. Her design {{incorporated}} the best features and capabilities of several amphibious assault ships currently in service. The ship had a well deck for deploying conventional and <b>air</b> <b>cushioned</b> landing <b>craft</b> and a flight deck for launching a variety of helicopters and Harrier jet aircraft. Belleau Wood was decommissioned on 28 October 2005 and was sunk {{as part of the}} Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 06 exercises on 13 July 2006.|$|R
5000|$|The Craftmaster {{insignia}} is a {{decoration of}} the United States Navy which is awarded to those personnel who have qualified as underway boat captains of U.S. Navy small vessels and support craft. Such boat commands which would qualify a service member for the Craftmaster badge include tugboats, Landing Craft Utility (LCU), Landing <b>Craft</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion</b> (LCAC), Lighterage <b>craft,</b> dredges, scows, and 44 foot yawls (Navy 44s).|$|R
5000|$|The assault {{support system}} on the ship co-ordinates {{vertical}} and horizontal movement of troops, cargo and vehicles. A Monorail system, moving at speeds up to 600 ft/min (3 m/s), transports cargo and supplies from storage and staging areas throughout the ship to a 13600 ft2 m2 well deck, which opens to the sea through huge gates in the ship's stern. There, the cargo, troops and vehicles are loaded onto landing craft for transit to the beach. The <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> landing <b>craft</b> can [...] "fly" [...] out of the dry well deck, or the well deck can be flooded so that conventional landing craft can float out {{on their way to}} the beach.|$|R
50|$|With Arthur W. J. G. Ord-Hume {{he formed}} Phoenix Aircraft in 1958, {{working on the}} {{evolution}} of crop dusting equipment and methods, building a wind tunnel in which to test them, and a subsequent agricultural aircraft. At this time, the design of the hovercraft was at an early stage, and when Ord-Hume suggested a flexible skirt system to retain the <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> beneath the <b>craft,</b> Latimer-Needham engineered a patentable design. Latimer-Needham then became a hovercraft consultant to the Saunders-Roe company.|$|R
40|$|Amphibious {{forces are}} the {{enabling}} force of choice to globally project rapid and sustainable combat {{power in the}} littoral. Whether delivering supplies and equipment for military operations or for humanitarian or disaster relief, the <b>Air</b> <b>Cushioned</b> Landing <b>Craft</b> (LCAC) is the primary surface ship-to- shore movement craft. The time needed to transfer the forces ashore may be critical to operational success and is an important planning consideration. Many factors complicate accurate prediction of this time. Even so, various commanders must use the best available information, given mission priorities and resource and capability limitations, to make numerous tradeoff decisions in planning and executing the movement of forces. In this paper, a simulation toolbox, the Simulated Mobility Modelling and Analysis Toolbox (SMMAT) is introduced, and a robust LCAC ship-to-shore simulation model is developed as an extension to SMMAT. This model provides the commander a prediction and tradeoff analysis tool for planning and executing the projection of power ashore. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R
50|$|Marines {{transport}} their <b>Marine</b> <b>Air</b> Ground Task Force (MAGTF)-attached Abrams tanks by combat ship. A Wasp-class Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) typically {{carries a}} platoon of 4 to 5 tanks attached to the deployed Marine Expeditionary Unit, which are then amphibiously transported to shore by Landing <b>Craft</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion</b> (LCAC) at 1 combat-ready tank per landing craft.|$|R
50|$|The LHDs {{can support}} amphibious {{landings}} in two forms: by landing craft, or by helicopter. In the 81 by 15.2 m well deck, the LHDs can carry three Landing <b>Craft</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion,</b> twelve Landing <b>Craft</b> Mechanised, or 40 Amphibious Assault Vehicles (AAVs), with another 21 AAVs on the vehicle deck. The flight deck has nine helicopter landing spots, and can operate helicopters and tiltrotors {{as large as}} the Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion and MV-22B Osprey. The size of the air combat element varies depending on the operation: a standard air combat element consists of six Harriers or six F-35B Lightning IIs and four AH-1W/Z Super Cobra/Viper attack helicopters for attack and support, twelve Ospreys and four Super Stallions for transport, and three or four Bell UH-1Y Venom utility helicopters. For a full assault, the air group can be maxed out at 22 Ospreys, while a Wasp operating in the sea control or 'Harrier carrier' or 'Lightning carrier' configuration carries 20 Harriers or F-35Bs (though some ships of the class have operated as many as 24 Harriers), supported by six Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopters for anti-submarine warfare. Two aircraft elevators move aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar; in order to transit the Panama Canal, these elevators need to be folded in.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{applications}} of <b>air</b> <b>cushions</b> are briefly reviewed in airships and tethered aerostats. The stress distributions of <b>air</b> <b>cushions</b> are simulated by {{finite element analysis}} software according to its load-carrying characteristics. Three kinds of interlayer forms are proposed and simulated thereafter. A best form of interlayer has been obtained via comparing the different analyzing results. In addition, an empirical formula is proposed for the differential pressures and load {{at the top of}} the <b>air</b> <b>cushions,</b> with experiments in which two kinds of <b>air</b> <b>cushions</b> are designed and their load carrying abilities are evaluated.

5000|$|A Surface Effect Ship (SES) or Sidewall Hovercraft is a {{watercraft}} {{that has}} both an <b>air</b> <b>cushion,</b> like a hovercraft, and twin hulls, like a catamaran. When the <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> is in use, {{a small portion}} of the twin hulls remain in the water.

In addition, forecast the divisibility of amphibious <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> motion in wave. The forecast result can effectively affect the basic motion characteristic of the hovercraft. The simulation result can use for the deeper research of motor function for the hovercraft operation, the debugging and optimization of the control system...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a current}} {{need for the}} {{development}} of new computational tools to model the seakeeping performance of <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> vehicles in support of the US Navy’s Landing <b>Craft</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion</b> (LCAC) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and possibly {{the development of a new}} connector as part of the Joint Maritime Assault Connector (JMAC) program. Much of the existing simulation capability for <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> vehicles was developed in the 1960 ’s, 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s to support the design of the LCAC and are coefficient-based models derived from small-scale experiments. The general utility of these simulations is limited in the design of new <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> vehicles, especially for innovative concepts or new components for increased performance capability. Advances in computing power and algorithms for free surface flows have made possible the development of new simulation tools to quantitatively assess design modifications and complement model tests of <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> vehicles. In this paper we describe the formulation, implementation and verification of a new computational model, called ACVSIM, to simulate the dynamics of <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> vehicles operating in waves. The primary components of ACVSIM include a high-order Rankine panel method for the hydrodynamic solution, an immersed boundary model for the solution of the <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> dynamics, and a structural dynamics model of the bag-and-finger skirt system. Several semi-empirical models for other force components, such as the aerodynamic drag, are planned for a future release of the code...|$|R
