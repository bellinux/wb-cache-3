Lab-on-a-chip systems are direct creation of the advancement in the miniaturization of these processes. They offer a host of exciting applications in several areas including clinical diagnostics, food and environmental analysis, and drug discovery and delivery studies. This paper reviews lab-on-a-chip systems from their components perspective. It provides a categorization of the standard functional components found in lab-on-a-chip devices together with {{an overview of the}} latest trends and developments related to lab-on-a-chip technologies and their application in nanobiotechnology. The functional components include: injector, transporter, preparator, <b>mixer,</b> reactor, <b>separator,</b> detector, controller, and power supply. The components are represented by appropriate symbols allowing designers to present their lab-on-a-chip products in a standard manner. Definition and role of each functional component are included and complemented with examples of existing work. Through the approach presented in this paper, it is hoped that modularity and technology transfer in lab-on-a-chip systems can be further facilitated and their application in nanobiotechnology be expanded. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{microfluidic}} {{research has}} enabled lab-on-a-chip (LoC) technology to achieve miniaturization {{and integration of}} biological and chemical analyses to a single chip comprising channels, valves, <b>mixers,</b> heaters, <b>separators,</b> and sensors. These miniature instruments appear to offer the rare combination of faster, cheaper, and higher-precision analyses in comparison to conventional bench-scale methods. LoCs have been applied to diverse domains such as proteomics, genomics, biochemistry, virology, cell biology, and chemical synthesis. However, to date LoCs have been designed as application-specific chips which incurs significant design effort, turn-around time, and cost, and degrades designer and user productivity. To address these limitations, we envision a programmable LoC (PLoC) and propose a comprehensive fluidic instruction set, called AquaCore Instruction Set (AIS), and a fluidic microarchitecture, called AquaCore, to implement AIS. We present four key design aspects in which the AIS and AquaCore differ from their computer counterparts, and our design decisions {{made on the basis}} of the implications of these differences. We demonstrate the use of the PLoC in a range of domains by hand-compiling real-world microfluidic assays in AIS, and show a detailed breakdown of the execution times for the assays and an estimate of the chip area...|$|R
40|$|Microfluidics {{has enabled}} {{lab-on-a-chip}} technology to miniaturize and integrate {{biological and chemical}} analyses to a single chip comprising channels, valves, <b>mixers,</b> heaters, <b>separators,</b> and sensors. Recent papers have proposed programmable labs-on-achip {{as an alternative to}} traditional application-specific chips to reduce design effort, time, and cost. While these previous papers provide the basic support for programmability, this paper identifies and addresses a practical issue, namely, fluid volume management. Volume management addresses the problem that the use of a fluid depletes it and unless the given volume of a fluid is distributed carefully among all its uses, execution may run out of the fluid before all its uses are complete. Additionally, fluid volumes should not overflow (i. e., exceed hardware capacity) or underflow (i. e., fall below hardware resolution). We show that the problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem (LP). Because LP’s complexity and slow execution times in practice may be a concern, we propose another approach, called DAGSolve, which over-constrains the problem to achieve linear complexity while maintaining good solution quality. We also propose two optimizations, called cascading and static replication, to handle cases involving extreme mix ratios and numerous fluid uses which may defeat both LP and DAGSolve. Using some real-world assays, we show that our techniques produce good solutions while being faster than LP...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade {{a large amount of}} {{analysis}} techniques have been scaled down to the microfluidic level. However, in many cases the necessary sample preparation, such as separation, mixing and concentration, remains to be performed off-chip. This represents a major hurdle for the introduction of miniaturized sample-in/answer-out systems, preventing the exploitation of microfluidic’s potential for small, rapid and accurate diagnostic products. New flow engineering methods are required to address this hitherto insufficiently studied aspect. One microfluidic tool {{that can be used to}} miniaturize and integrate sample preparation procedures are microvortices. They have been successfully applied as microcentrifuges, <b>mixers,</b> particle <b>separators,</b> to name but a few. In this work, we utilize a novel corner structure at a sudden channel expansion of a microfluidic chip to enhance the formation of a microvortex. For a maximum area of the microvortex, both chip geometry and corner structure were optimized with a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model. Fluorescent particle trace measurements with the optimized design prove that the corner structure increases the size of the vortex. Furthermore, vortices are induced by the corner structure at low flow rates while no recirculation is observed without a corner structure. Finally, successful separation of plasma from human blood was accomplished, demonstrating a potential application for clinical sample preparation. The extracted plasma was characterized by a flow cytometer and compared to plasma obtained from a standard benchtop centrifuge and from chips without a corner structure...|$|R

They include a comprehensive fluidic instruction set, called AquaCore Instruction Set (AIS), a fluidic microarchitecture, called AquaCore, and a high-level language and compiler. ^ In this work I present five key contributions. First, I present my design decisions for AIS and AquaCore {{made on the basis}} of key design aspects in which AIS and AquaCore differ from their computer counterparts. Second, I identify and address a practical issue, namely, fluid volume management. Volume management addresses the problem that the use of a fluid depletes it and unless the given volume of a fluid is distributed carefully among all its uses, execution may run out of the fluid before all its uses are complete. Third, I identify and address another practical issue, that of fluid contamination. Contamination arises because fluid flow is not perfect and leaves residue in the PLoC 2 ̆ 7 s components (e. g., channels and reservoirs) despite efforts to reduce such residue. This residue may contaminate the next fluid that uses the same components. Fourth, I establish a benchmark suite of real-world assays that cover a wide range of domains, and use them to evaluate the PLoC concept and proposed solutions to the fluid volume management and contamination issues. Finally, I develop a working PLoC prototype, compiler suite, runtime system and control platform and use it to run two real-world diverse assays as a proof-of-concept to the PLoC approach. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{separation}} {{network synthesis}} (SNS) {{is a major}} research field of process synthesis. A separation network comprises <b>separators,</b> <b>mixers,</b> and dividers, collectively called operating units, through which multi-component streams flow while being processed. Various combinations of the operating units, usually {{give rise to a}} multitude of complex networks. The aim of SNS is to combine operating units so that the resultant network generates the desired products with the lowest possible cost. A procedure for generating rigorous super-structures is proposed herein. The objective of the current work is to solve SNS problems in which the candidate separators are affected by different mechanisms. Such mechanisms are always based on different physical or chemical properties of the components to be separated, e. g., volatility, solubility, permeability, adsorptability, and density. The majority of SNS methods, however, takes into account only a single property, mainly the volatility. The current work introduces a novel algorithmic method for generating the super-structure and the related mathematical-programming model for a class of SNS problems, which involves any number of components, feeds and products and the available separators can be based on different mechanisms. For simplicity, the separators are regarded to be of the simple and sharp type, and the cost of a separator is linear. The efficacy of the algorithm is illustrated by an on-line demonstration. 1...|$|R
40|$|The process {{miniaturization}} {{constitutes a}} challenge for the Chemical Engineering domain. The particular benefit in term of the increase of the ratio between the transfer surface area and the fluid volume inside microfluidic system is really promising for the conception of efficient apparatus such as microreactors, micromixers and microseparators allowing a better chemical reaction control and heat and mass transfer intensification in order to realize sustainable industrial equipments. On other hand, a proper design of a microstructured platform where miniaturized reactors, <b>mixers</b> and <b>separators</b> are implemented with integrated sensors is crucial for the fabrication of new materials, chemical or bio-chemical products and testing new catalyst and reagent (Gunther & Jensen, 2006). Flow and mass transfer characterization inside these new tools of development and production is fundamental for their optimal design. Yet, these new pieces of equipment are made in stainless steel integrating about hundreds of microchannels either about several tens of microexchangers. These microstructured exchangers can operate at high pressure and present three-dimensional geometries. Hessel et al. (2005) report the order of magnitude of the flow rate in various microstructured reactors. The flow rates range between 10 and 10000 l. h- 1 and the flow regime is usually transitional or turbulent. In spite of new experimental methods (Sato et al., 2003; Natrajan & Christensen, 2007), it remains difficult to measure simultaneously a scalar quantity (concentration, temperature, velocity) at different locations of the microstructured reactors. Thus, a lot of difficulties occur in the prediction of wall transfer phenomena (heat, mass, momentum) in the microstructured reactors in view of their integration in chemical manufacture. A characterization of the flow behaviour and of heat and mass transfer performance is {{needed in order to}} develop and improve these microsystems for their application in process engineering. A large number of studies dealing with flow through microsystems of different shapes and flow configurations is available in the literature since a few years. Among them, T-microchannel (Bothe et al., 2006) or hydrodynamics focusing (Wu & Nguyen, 2005) are some promising classes of flow configurations for microfluidics apparatus applications. Various complex geometries are usually studied by using numerical approaches or global measurements to characterize transfer phenomena in heat exchangers (Brandner et al., 2006) or microreactors (Commenge et al., 2004). The flow inside these microreactors or microexhangers are usually in the transitional or turbulent regime and the experimental description of all the hydrodynamics scales become more difficult than in classical macrodevices...|$|R
40|$|Microfluidics is {{the science}} of {{designing}} and manufacturing devices and processes for manipulation of extremely small volumes of fluid, typically micro to nanoliters. The most mature application of microfluidics technology is ink-jet printing, which uses orifices less than 100 μm in diameter to generate drops of ink. The complex devices now being developed for biological applications involving the analysis of DNA (in genetics and genomics) and proteins (in proteomics) and bio-defense typically involve aqueous solutions and channels 30 to 300 μm in diameter. Unlike microelectronics, in which the current emphasis is on reducing the size of transistors, microfluidics is focusing on making more complex systems of channels with more sophisticated fluid-handling capabilities, rather than reducing {{the size of the}} channels. Although micro- and macro-fluidic systems require similar components including pumps, valves, <b>mixers,</b> filters, and <b>separators,</b> the small size of microchannels causes their flow to behave differently. At micron scales, fluid motions are primarily dominated by surface tension and viscous forces. In the problem under consideration, the issue is one of wicking or leaking of the sample from the reaction reservoir to the waste region at elevated temperatures. A mechanism responsible for this phenomenon was thought to be the "wedge effect," which refers to the tendency of liquids to move along a sharp corner by capillary effects if the conditions are right. The analysis performed during the workshop also mainly focused on this effect. While a definitive solution to this challenging problem posed in the workshop was not identified, it was felt that using a manufacturing process that can affect the corner angles in the channels may hold the most promise, allowing the wicking mechanism to be controlled without surface treatments that insert hydrophobic stops in the channel. For instance by "rounding" the side walls to increase the corner angles from 90 toward 180 degrees, the leaking of the sample away from the reaction chamber might be delayed...|$|R
40|$|Photochemistry is a {{research}} field with high potential, promising important future industrial and environmental applications such as pollutant removal, CO 2 reduction back to fuel, alternative solar energy storages and novel materials. On the other hand, making these promises feasible and therefore applied, falls within the purpose of photoreactor design branch of chemical engineering science. However, photoreactor design could not yet {{live up to its}} whole potential as many promising photochemical reactions have not yet been integrated to industrial usage. The issue with photoreactor design is that it adds a new type of transport phenomenon to the pre-existing mass and heat transfer, which is the photon transfer. The intuitive solution to this new problem has been to apply microflow reactors which had already achieved drastic increases in apparent reaction rates for reactions without light. When light was added to the intensified mass and heat transfer medium of microflow reactors, up to five orders of magnitude increase in apparent photochemical reaction rate was observed when compared to stirred tank photoreactors. This enabled the photo-microflow chemistry branch to blossom. Photo-microflow strategy aims to improve the practical usage of photochemistry by increasing the reaction rate. However, it also inherits the biggest drawback from the microflow reactors, which is the lack of throughput. Increase of the reaction rate may mean higher production rate per volume, but if it comes at the expense of reactor volume itself, at a certain point, further decrease in the volume may be counter-productive and may decrease the product output. This suggests an optimization case. This work is a compilation of case studies on two applications namely photocatalytic waste degradation in wastewater and photochemical waste purification from lamp phosphor waste. After a brief state-of-the-art on various photoreactor designs, the thesis focuses on the development and validation of a computational model for immobilized catalyst reactors for micropollutant removal from wastewater. The model does not only predict the apparent reaction rate, but is also able to calculate the concentration gradient within the catalyst coating and the free-flowing medium. In the following chapter, the thesis focuses on the waste purification application and proposes a new <b>mixer</b> - phase <b>separator</b> for solvent extraction of Eu. The phase separation does not rely on gravity, but is based on differences in wettability. This chapter, focusing on a non-photochemical system, shows that as the reactor channel dimension increases, the space-time yield decreases, but throughput increases, which requires less need for numbering up to meet the industrial throughput. This work has also shown that the 30 min long mixing-settling process can be intensified such that it is completed in 10 s in industrial concentrations. The next chapter focuses on the scale up of intensified systems and iterates on the optimization problem stated above. It proposes a new benchmark, namely the photochemical space-time yield (PSTY), and proves that it can compare waste degradation reactors of very different scales and sizes. Furthermore, PSTY is proven to predict the industrial applicability of a reactor as the pilot-scale reactors scored higher than the laboratory scale ones. In the following chapter, using PSTY, the said optimization case was proven and a method was proposed to calculate the optimum reactor characteristic length for a case study of photochemical Eu precipitation. The results prove that PSTY is not only a benchmark, but also a design parameter. The irradiance in the reactor was also modelled with a newly developed model, which uses P 1 approximation of radiative transfer equation in participating media and a simple empirical equation for the air medium. In summary, this thesis studies photoreactor design and iterates on the strategies of scale-up of these promising platforms. status: publishe...|$|R
