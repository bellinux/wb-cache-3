25|$|The {{best way}} {{to speed up the}} baby-step giant-step {{algorithm}} is to use an efficient table lookup scheme. The best in this case is a hash table. The hashing is done on the second component, and to perform the check in step 1 of the <b>main</b> <b>loop,</b> γ is hashed and the resulting memory address checked. Since hash tables can retrieve and add elements in O(1) time (constant time), this does not slow down the overall baby-step giant-step algorithm.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} {{the most commonly}} used (μ/μw, λ)-CMA-ES is outlined, where in each iteration step a weighted combination of the μ best out of λ new candidate solutions is used to update the distribution parameters. The <b>main</b> <b>loop</b> consists of three main parts: 1) sampling of new solutions, 2) re-ordering of the sampled solutions based on their fitness, 3) update of the internal state variables based on the re-ordered samples. A pseudocode of the algorithm looks as follows.|$|E

The {{battlefield}} is located within the Black Hawk Unit of the state managed and owned Lower Wisconsin State Riverway, along Highway 78, about a mile south of County Road Y, south of Sauk City. There are trails, a historic marker and a parking area at the site. Though the area around the battle site does not include modern amenities, such as plumbing and toilets, the trails within the Black Hawk Unit of the Lower Wisconsin State Riverway stretch three miles (5km) over rugged terrain.

25|$|Information {{provided}} to the IAEA indicated that storage pool temperatures at both Units 5 and 6 remained steady around 60–68°C between 19:00 JST 14 March and 21:00 JST 18 March, though rising slowly. On 18 March reactor water levels remained around 2 m above the top of fuel rods. It was confirmed that panels {{had been removed from}} the roofs of Units 5 and 6 to allow any hydrogen gas to escape. At 04:22 on 19 March, the second unit of emergency generator A for Unit 6 was restarted which allowed operation of pump C of the residual heat removal system (RHR) in Unit 5 to cool the spent fuel storage pool and reactor core alternately. Later in the day, Pump B in Unit 6 was also restarted to allow cooling of the spent fuel pool and reactor core there. Crews had installed temporary submersible seawater pumps and hoses to supply cooling water to the residual heat removal system heat exchangers as the main seawater pumps were heavily damaged by the tsunami. Additionally, as there was heavy damage to electrical equipment in the basements from flooding, temporary power connections had to be made to the residual heat removal system <b>main</b> <b>loop</b> pumps. Temperature at Unit 5 pool decreased to 48°C on 19 March 18:00 JST, and 37°C on 20 March when Unit 6 pool temperature had fallen to 41°C. On 20 March, NISA announced that both reactors had been returned to a condition of cold shutdown.|$|E
2500|$|The Bellman–Ford {{algorithm}} may {{be improved}} in practice (although {{not in the}} worst case) by the observation that, if an iteration of the <b>main</b> <b>loop</b> of the algorithm terminates without making any changes, the algorithm can be immediately terminated, as subsequent iterations will not make any more changes.

40|$|A {{previously}} described parameter estimation program {{was applied to}} a number of control tasks, each involving a human operator model consisting of more than one describing function. One of these experiments is treated in more detail. It consisted of a two dimensional tracking task with identical controlled elements. The tracking errors were presented on one display as two vertically moving horizontal lines. Each loop had its own manipulator. The two forcing functions were mutually independent and consisted each of 9 sine waves. A human operator model was chosen consisting of 4 describing functions, thus taking into account possible linear cross couplings. From the Fourier coefficients of the relevant signals the model parameters were estimated after alignment, averaging over a number of runs and decoupling. The results show that for the elements in the <b>main</b> <b>loops</b> the crossover model applies. A weak linear cross coupling existed with the same dynamics as the elements in the <b>main</b> <b>loops</b> but with a negative sign...|$|R

2500|$|Yen's second {{improvement}} first assigns some arbitrary {{linear order}} on all vertices and then partitions {{the set of}} all edges into two subsets.

Each vertex is visited in the order v1, v2, ..., v|V|, relaxing each outgoing edge from that vertex in Ef. Each vertex is then visited in the order v|V|, v|V|−1, ..., v1, relaxing each outgoing edge from that vertex in Eb.
