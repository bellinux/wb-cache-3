40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of the design and implementation of the interprocess communications facility developed for the AN/BSY- 2 distributed computer system, the computer system for the Seawolf submarine. The interprocess communications facility was identified as a critical design challenge for the AN/BSY- 2 system, as the system incorporated new component and network technology along with new run time system services as well as application programs. The requirements specified for the interprocess communications included aggressive performance, as well as functional capabilities that had not been previously fielded. The AN/BSY- 2 computer system is comprised of over 100 processors interconnected in multiple fault tolerant fiber optic rings. First, a description of the AN/BSY- 2 distributed architecture is presented. The message-passing semantics are then presented. A key feature of the IPC facility is it’s support for both synchronous and asynchronous communications based on logical addressing. Logical addressing within the AN/BSY- 2 system supports point to point as well as group communications, and also supports the fault tolerant requirements of the system. The hardware developed to support fast real time messaging, and support fault tolerance is discussed. Finally, the low level semantics of a <b>message</b> <b>transfer</b> through the <b>system</b> is outlined. 1...|$|R

It is further indicated that earlier accelerators had manual control systems to which computers were added, but that it is essential for the new, large accelerators to include computers in the control systems right from the beginning. Details of the computer control designed for the Super Proton Synchrotron are presented. The method of choosing the computers is described, as well as the reasons for CERN having to design the <b>message</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>system.</b> The items discussed include: CAMAC interface systems, a new multiplex system, operator-to-computer interaction (such as touch screen, computer-controlled knob, and non- linear track-ball), and high-level control languages.

40|$|Abstract: Huge {{and complex}} {{business}} systems are usually supported by previously developed or inherited information systems, {{which have been}} developed {{on the basis of}} business functions standard model. Such information systems cover a particular business fields, but, since they have been developed in an independent and uncoordinated way, there're modest possibilities of interacted automated data exchange because of heterogeneous data, first of all. Because of increasing data exchange needs, resulting from interconnectedness of business processes and permanent changes in internal and external circumstances, development and upgrading of programme procedures is an imperative. In this connection it is necessary to find ways and means to integrate all existing information systems in given circumstances and render possible exchange and usage of all needed data in a reliable and consistent way. The problem can be solved organizationally and technically in different ways and this paper, within information system planning phase, investigates the possibility to use <b>message</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>system.</b> This implies initiation of automated data exchange between existing information business systems providing for full scale control and management of mutually exchangeable data. Chapter 1 and 2 deal with the necessity to integrate information systems of a business system; the concept of solution model is given as well. Chapter 3 explains technical aspects of examined integration solution at logical level. Possibilities to enlarge the elaborated approach on future integration processes in relation to a business system external circumstances are examined in Chapter 4. Conclusive Chapter 5 reveals benefits which can be achieved by application of proposed concept of the information systems integration. The approach itself is open for enlargement, dynamic adjustements and extensions needed to fulfill business system needs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{light-weight}} asynchronous message progression mechanism for large <b>message</b> <b>transfers</b> in <b>Message</b> Passing Interface (MPI) Rendezvous protocol that is scenario-conscious and consequently overhead-free {{in cases where}} independent message progression naturally happens. Without requiring a dedicated thread, we take advantage of small bursts of CPU to poll for <b>message</b> <b>transfer</b> conditions. The existing application thread is parasitized {{for the purpose of}} getting those small bursts of CPU. Our proposed approach is only triggered when the <b>message</b> <b>transfer</b> would otherwise be deferred to the MPI wait call; and it allows for full message progression, achieving 100 % overlap. It does not add to the memory footprint of the applications, and is effective in improving the communication performance of most of the applications studied in this paper. I...|$|R
40|$|Three {{problems}} {{in relation to}} Luciano Floridi’s work on the Philosophy of Information (PI) {{and the relationship of}} PI to Library and Information Science (LIS) are considered: the claim that LIS is a materials-based discipline, Floridi’s claim about Information as a <b>message</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>system,</b> and his downgrading of Social Epistemology to be a subset of PI. The recent history of LIS and the practice of professional library work are examined for evidence of the basis for making claims about LIS. A view of information based on individual interpretations is preferred to Floridi’s account, which is found to be too innocent of LIS practice to be accepted without revision, as is his view of LIS as an applied PI. Luciano Floridi has provided us with a sweeping review of work on Information. He has, in particular, advanced claims for a Philosophy of Information (PI), and has identified Library and Information Science (LIS) as applied PI. He has labeled us thus contra the claims of Shera and others that LIS is based on a social epistemology. If we accept Floridi’s claims, we will see ourselves {{as part of a larger}} PI movement whose problems and program have been identified by Floridi in his forthcoming Open Problems in the Philosophy of Information (OPPI) (Floridi, in press-b). Many of these problems and several parts of the program will be familiar to LIS readers, especially those concerned with work in information retrieval. Much of Floridi’s work is commendable on several counts. In particular, he has proposed a philosophical grounding to support much of what we in the LIS community do. His work reveals a deep structure of support in straight philosophy and in logic fo...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We study <b>message</b> <b>transfer</b> in a 2 -d {{communication}} network of regular nodes and randomly distributed hubs. We study both single <b>message</b> <b>transfer</b> and multiple <b>message</b> <b>transfer</b> on the lattice. The average travel time for single messages travelling between source and target pairs of fixed separations shows q-exponential behaviour {{as a function}} of hub density with a characteristic power-law tail, indicating a rapid drop in the average travel time {{as a function of}} hub density. This power-law tail arises {{as a consequence of the}} log-normal distribution of travel times seen at high hub densities. When many messages travel on the lattice, a congestion–decongestion transition can be seen. The waiting times of messages in the congested phase show a Gaussian distribution, whereas the decongested phase shows a log-normal distribution. Thus the waiting time distributions carry the signature of congested or decongested behaviour...|$|R
40|$|AbstractManaging a {{connection}} between two hosts in a network is an important service to provide {{in order to make}} the network useful for many applications. The two main subproblems are the management of serial incarnations of {{a connection}} and the <b>transfer</b> of <b>messages</b> within an incarnation, This paper investigates whether it is necessary for connection management protocols to retain state information across node crashes and between incarnations. The following results were obtained: •When information is not retained across node crashes, incarnation management is not possible at all. •When information is not retained between incarnations, incarnation management is possible if the network is FIFO and not possible if the network is non-FIFO. •When information is not retained across node crashes, <b>message</b> <b>transfer</b> can be accomplished in networks that lose packets if the network is FIFO the protocol is allowed a variable length grace period after a crash during which it need not deliver <b>messages.</b> However, <b>message</b> <b>transfer</b> cannot be accomplished if the network is non-FIFO or the grace period allowed is fixed. •When information is not retained across node crashes, <b>message</b> <b>transfer</b> can he accomplished in networks that do not lose packets if the network is FIFO the protocol need not be FIFO, <b>Message</b> <b>transfer</b> is not possible when the network is non-FIFO and the protocol must be FIFO. •If the network has bounded capacity, then <b>message</b> <b>transfer</b> is possible without using stable storage.
