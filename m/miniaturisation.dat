The technology enabled people to see, hear and participate in all the familiar forms stories, theatre, music, dance wherever they live. The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in data storage devices such as cassette tapes or compact discs, along with increasing <b>miniaturisation.</b> Computerisation and the development of barcodes also made ticketing easier, faster and global.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the 1960s {{setting of}} The Secret Service, Derek Meddings and the {{technicians}} {{of the special}} effects department received few commissions for scale models of vehicles that appeared futuristic. This left Unwin's vintage Ford Model T, Gabriel, as their main project, in addition to rendering vehicles and settings common to the decade in miniature and producing the optical enlargement and <b>miniaturisation</b> effects for the character of Harding. Wag Evans manufactured a full-size and two miniature versions (the last of differing scales) of Gabriel, fitting the larger car with belt-driven electric motors, a folding roof, upholstered interior, and a remote control mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length of passive components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common {{rule of thumb is}} to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing <b>miniaturisation</b> of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of these}} advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{new designs}} were {{discussed}} but {{concerns over the}} technical aspects (a photograph or a painting inspired by a photograph) delayed a full competition for artists until 1965. Postmaster General Tony Benn and artist David Gentleman failed {{in their attempts to}} have the royal head replaced by the name of the country ("Great Britain" [...] or [...] "U.K."), but were permitted to explore temporary solutions to the commemorative head problems. This would of course have removed the uniqueness of the United Kingdom in being the only producer of postage stamps not to have its country name on its stamps in honour of its origination of the adhesive postage stamp in 1840. In 1966 Gentleman created a small single-coloured profile from a coin by Mary Gillick. The project waited until the <b>miniaturisation</b> of the new definitive effigy that the Stamp Advisory Committee (SAC) had advised the Postmaster General on 13 January 1965 be chosen, from profiles and engraved images based on a photograph.|$|E

50|$|Discheramocephalus minutissimus is {{a species}} of feather-winged beetle, the {{smallest}} beetles on earth, first found in Indonesia. This species' adults have a body length of approximately 400 to 426µm. According to Grebennikov, the main factor limiting <b>miniaturisation</b> of female insects is an egg size significant enough in size to produce viable larvae. This size threshold is sometimes overcome, reaching limits of 180 and 130 µm in females and males, respectively, according to the author. Brain size is possibly {{the second most important}} factor limiting <b>miniaturisation</b> in this class.|$|E

50|$|At first, {{components}} made in planar formats {{were made}} as discrete parts connected together, usually with coaxial lines and connectors. However, it was quickly realised {{that the size}} of circuits could be hugely reduced by directly connecting components together with planar lines within the same housing. This led to the concept of hybrid MICs. Hybrid because lumped components were included in the designs connected together with planar lines. From the 1970s, there has been a great proliferation in new variations of the basic planar formats to aid <b>miniaturisation</b> and mass production. Further <b>miniaturisation</b> became possible with the introduction of MMICs. In this technology, the planar transmission lines are directly incorporated in the semiconductor slab in which the integrated circuit components have been manufactured. The first MMIC, an X band amplifier, is due to Pengelly and Turner of Plessey in 1976.|$|E
50|$|Suspended {{microstrip}} has {{the same}} aim as suspended stripline; to put the field into air rather than the dielectric to reduce losses and dispersion. The reduced permittivity results in larger printed components, which detracts from <b>miniaturisation,</b> but is easier to manufacture. Suspending the substrate increases the maximum frequency at which the format can be used.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-2000s, phone makers such as Nokia and Motorola enjoyed {{record sales}} of featurephones. In {{developed}} economies, sales {{were based on}} fashion and brand, as markets had matured, and people were into their second and third phones. In the U.S., technological innovation with regard to expanded functionality was a secondary consideration, as phone designs there centered on <b>miniaturisation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Miniaturization (Br.Eng.: <b>Miniaturisation)</b> is {{the trend}} to {{manufacture}} ever smaller mechanical, optical and electronic products and devices. Examples include miniaturization of mobile phones, computers and vehicle engine downsizing. In electronics, Moore's Law {{predicted that the}} number of transistors on an integrated circuit for minimum component cost doubles every 18 months. This enables processors to be built in smaller sizes.|$|E

50|$|In 1925, the LeCoultre Calibre 7BF Duoplan {{was created}} {{in an effort to}} bring {{together}} <b>miniaturisation</b> and precision. The fashion of the period was for small wristwatches, however small calibres often suffered from a loss of reliability. Created by Henri Rodanet, the technical director of Etablissements Ed. Jaeger, the Duoplan was built on two levels - hence its name - enabling it to maintain a large-size balance.|$|E

50|$|Created in 1992, Eurotech is {{a global}} company that {{operates}} in multiple countries. It follows the technological paradigm of Pervasive Computing. The concept of pervasive or ubiquitous computing, involves <b>miniaturisation</b> and the distribution in the environment of intelligent devices and their possibility of communicating. In this respect, NanoPCs and HPCs are the two major classes of devices that, by connecting to and co-operating, form a computing infrastructure labeled the pervasive GRID or pervasive computing grid.|$|E
50|$|William Jones (1763-1831) was an English {{maker of}} optical and other {{scientific}} instruments, who had Thomas Jefferson among his customers in London.

In 1797,Jones introduced the box sextant or 'pocket sextant' for nautical navigation, an early marvel of mechanical <b>miniaturisation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sinclair, {{unable to}} find capital, joined United Trade Press (UTP) as {{technical}} editor of Instrument Practice. Sinclair appeared in the publication as an assistant editor in March 1962. Sinclair described making silicon planar transistors, their properties and applications and hoped they might be available {{by the end of}} 1962. Sinclair's obsession with <b>miniaturisation</b> became more obvious as his career progressed. Sinclair undertook a survey for Instrument Practice of semiconductor devices, which appeared in four sections between September 1962 and January 1963.|$|E
50|$|With new {{developments}} in <b>miniaturisation,</b> communications and sensors a new radiosonde the model RS41 (2014 - in production) was announced.

It is also available in a model (RS41-SG) without a pressure sensor, the pressure reading {{is derived from the}} GPS altitude, temperature and humidity readings.|$|E
