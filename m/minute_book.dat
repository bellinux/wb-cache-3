5|$|The rugby union side Sale F.C. {{has been}} based in Sale since 1861 and at its present Heywood Road ground since 1905. One of the oldest rugby clubs in the world, its 1865 <b>Minute</b> <b>Book</b> is the oldest {{existing}} book containing {{the rules of the}} game. The professional Sale Sharks team was originally part of Sale F.C. but split from it in 2003. Sale Sharks now play their matches at Salford City Stadium, although they retain the use of the Heywood Road ground for training and for the staging of home games involving their reserve team, Sale Jets. The town is also home to the Ashton upon Mersey and Trafford Metrovick rugby union clubs.|$|E
25|$|The Tramways Committee met {{nearly every}} two weeks and the minutes record a {{constant}} stream of accidents and claims on the committee for damages too numerous to list here. There are complaints by shopkeepers against tramcar drivers who let their horses and cars stand outside the shop. There are records of payments to tramcar drivers who acted bravely in restraining horses which were startled and bolted. Despite the imminent introduction of electric cars, the horse tram rails still required maintenance, and the <b>minute</b> <b>book</b> records that the track outside the Mechanics Institute was replaced at the end of 1897.|$|E
25|$|The {{first meeting}} of the College Historical Society took place on Wednesday, 21 March 1770,. The society took into its care the <b>minute</b> <b>book</b> of Burke's Club, founded 1747, from which the Hist has since drawn inspiration. Its other {{precursor}} was the Historical Club, founded 1753, of which Henry Grattan was a member. James Reid became the first Auditor of the Hist later in 1770. It {{was a time of}} great change in Ireland and the Western world, {{at the height of the}} Enlightenment and before the American War of Independence and the French Revolution. From its inception it showed itself to be at the forefront of intellectual thought in Ireland, and many of its members later went into politics. In 1782, Lawrence Parsons was elected as an MP for the University of Dublin at 24, having served as Auditor of the Hist just the previous year.|$|E

25|$|The Old Charges of the masons' lodges were {{documents}} {{describing the}} duties of the members, part of which (the charges) every mason had to swear on admission. For this reason, every lodge had a copy of its charges, occasionally written into the beginning of the <b>minute</b> <b>book,</b> but usually as a separate manuscript roll of parchment. With the coming of Grand Lodges, these were largely superseded by printed constitutions, but the Grand Lodge of All England at York, and the few lodges that remained independent in Scotland and Ireland, retained the hand-written charges as their authority to meet as a lodge. Woodford, Hughan, Speth and Gould, all founders of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, and Dr Begemann, a German Freemason, produced much published work {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century, collating, cataloguing, and classifying the available material. Since then, aside from the occasional rediscovery of another old document, little has been done to update the field.|$|E
25|$|The {{records of}} the Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No.1 extend back to 1598, making them an {{important}} historical source as the longest continuous masonic record. David Murray Lyon's history of the lodge, published in 1873, mined the records of Edinburgh's oldest lodge, and produced a history of Scottish Freemasonry. The first entry, on 28 December 1598, is {{a copy of the}} first Schaw statutes. The next year, {{on the last day of}} July, the first proper minute records disciplinary proceedings against a member who employed a cowan, or unqualified mason. The first entries are terse and not always helpful, expanding as successive secretaries became more conscientious. The records trace the development of the lodge from an operative to a speculative society. Only one older <b>minute</b> <b>book</b> has been discovered, that of Aitchison's Haven, a location just outside Musselburgh, in East Lothian. The first entry records Robert Widderspone being made Fellow of Craft on 9 January 1598.|$|E
25|$|Haughfoot was a hamlet, {{consisting}} {{mainly of}} a staging post for horses and carriages, in the Scottish Borders {{near the village}} of Stow. It was in this unlikely location that a Lodge was founded in 1702 by men who were mainly local landowners. The significance of this Lodge {{lies in the fact that}} none of its members were stonemasons, confirming that modern Freemasonry was fully evolved in Scotland before the appearance of centralised authority in the form of Grand Lodges. The <b>Minute</b> <b>Book</b> of the Lodge, which is extant, commences in 1702 and inside the front covers is the part which is identical to the last portion of the Edinburgh Register House and Airlie MSS. Although not complete (the missing part was almost certainly removed for reasons of secrecy) the Haughfoot fragment is sufficient to confirm that it was very likely to have been identical to the two previously mentioned MSS. The 'fragment' was probably retained because the Minute of the first meeting of the Lodge commences immediately after this portion of ritual on the same page.|$|E

500|$|On Friday 30 November 1888, Druitt was {{dismissed}} {{from his post}} at the Blackheath boys' school. The reason for his dismissal is unclear. One newspaper, quoting his brother William's inquest testimony, reported that he {{was dismissed}} because he [...] "had got into serious trouble", but did not specify any further. In early December 1888, he disappeared, and on 21 December 1888 the Blackheath Cricket Club's <b>minute</b> <b>book</b> records that he was removed as treasurer and secretary {{in the belief that}} he had [...] "gone abroad".|$|E
500|$|In May 1866, the MCC's <b>minute</b> <b>book</b> {{featured}} {{an unusual}} request: Roland Newbury, the club's pavilion keeper, wanted [...] "use {{of the ground}} for two days... for purpose of a match with the native black eleven". It was the first intimation of a cricket match between the MCC and an Aboriginal team from Victoria's Western District. The motive behind the match, scheduled for late December, was a financial one, and in August, Wills agreed to coach the Aborigines. Wills' reasons for accepting the role remain a mystery, but his need for money was likely a factor. This was to {{mark the beginning of}} his transition from amateur to professional sportsman.|$|E

500|$|The club colours are a claret {{shirt with}} sky blue sleeves, white shorts with claret and blue trim, and sky blue socks with claret and white trim.

For {{a few years after}} that (1877–79) the team wore several different kits from all white, blue and black, red and blue to plain green. By 1880, black jerseys with a red lion embroidered on the chest were introduced by William McGregor. This remained the first choice strip for six years.

500|$|Back in 1919, the Palace <b>minute</b> <b>book</b> {{contained}} an entry instructing the Secretary {{to investigate the}} possibility of obtaining a lease on the 'ground at Selhurst'. Calling it a 'ground' was a little misleading since {{at the time it}} was a piece of wasteland valuable only to the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company. At one time it had been a brickfield, and two chimney stacks still remained. On 3 January 1922 the club purchased the ground at a cost of £2,750, and renowned football ground architect Archibald Leitch was commissioned to design Selhurst Park. Leitch had designed stands at Craven Cottage, Stamford Bridge, White Hart Lane and Leeds Road, but the design for Palace was unusual in that it had no roof gable. The other three sides of the ground remained open banking with just the lower parts being terraced. Construction work was delayed by industrial disputes, and when the ground was opened by the Lord Mayor of London on the first day of the 1924–25 season, 30 August, the stand was not finished. It did however boast many luxuries, including [...] "offices, tea rooms, training quarters, plunge, slipper shower and needle baths". The opening fixture was against The Wednesday, and in front of a crowd of 25,000, Palace lost 0–1, with the first goal at Selhurst Park being scored by Billy Marsden. That defeat set the tone for the season, and the club finished in twenty-first place – relegated along with Coventry City. A win in the last game at home to Oldham Athletic would have secured survival, but Palace went down 0–1 and it would be almost 40 years before Palace would again grace the second level of English football. One small consolation was the decision by the FA to stage the England versus Wales international at Selhurst Park on 1 March 1925. It remains the only full international staged at the ground, and Wales won the game 3–1.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1914, The Herald {{reported}} that City {{had agreed to}} [...] "£20 for {{each member of the}} party with first class return fare and all hotel and travelling expenses for account of the AFA" [...] to go on tour, the same terms offered to Tottenham Hotspur. According to the AFA's <b>minute</b> <b>book</b> for the meeting of 26 February 1914, the item heading 'Team Exeter City' replaced that which had read 'Team de Inglaterra'. Club chairman Michael McGahey, directors Fred Parkhouse and George Middleweek (who paid for his own trip) and their wives, and fifteen players set sail in May 1914. Manager Arthur Chadwick was too ill to join the party, hence why McGahey travelled. The boat trip to Argentina lasted three weeks, stopping off at Vigo, Madeira, Rio de Janeiro, Santos and Montevideo along the way. Yellow fever prevented passengers from landing in Recife and Salvador da Bahia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} <b>minute</b> <b>book</b> of any Masonic lodge on the North American continent is {{that for}} Tun Tavern Lodge No. 3 ( [...] of the Moderns) in Philadelphia. [...] The Tun Tavern was the first [...] "brew house" [...] in the city, being built in 1685, and was located on the waterfront {{at the corner of}} Water Street and Tun Alley. The extant records of the Lodge begin on 24 June 1731, but the lodge may have been older than that. It was reported by Benjamin Franklin, in his Gazette for 8 December 1730, that there were [...] "several Lodges of Free Masons erected in this Province...." [...] The Tun Tavern, being a popular meeting place in Philadelphia, was undoubtedly the first location of a lodge in Philadelphia. Other organizations were formed there, including the St. George's Society in 1720, and the St. Andrew's Society in 1747. Even the United States Marine Corps was founded there on 10 November 1775 by Samuel Nicholas, grandson of a member of the Tun Tavern Lodge. According to Henry Coil, a Freemason from Massachusetts, the Tun Tavern Lodge was never warranted nor issued a charter, being an [...] "immemorial rights lodge." [...] However, the Librarian of the Masonic Library in Philadelphia believes that, simply because there is no existing evidence, {{there is no reason to}} assume that the Tun Tavern Lodge was never warranted since all of the other Lodges at the time had been, and that it must have been warranted prior to 1749 since the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania has in its archives the minute books for the Tun Tavern Lodge from 1749-1755.|$|E

His mouth, which embraced a large cigar, he kept continually screwing round and round and from side to side, as he looked sagaciously and coldly at the strangers.
