Bob Lang tried his best to take Kathy to bed with him, but the teenaged Kathy wisely continued to feel {{that might not be}} for the best, but Kathy's defenses were weakening where Bob was concerned. Then Kathy suffered an illness for a few days and was taken to Cedars Hospital and that's where she met the eligible bachelor and first cousin to Peggy Ashley Regan, Dr. Richard [...] "Dick" [...] Grant, Jr. who had just moved from San Francisco. (Peggy was the niece of Dick's mother, Laura Ashley Grant, who was married to Dick's father, Richard Grant, Sr.) Dick was everything Kathy dreamed about when it came to a man, unfortunately although Meta and Joe approved of Dick, and Richard approved Kathy, the rich snobby Laura DID NOT! Dick even proposed marriage to Kathy, but seeing how Laura disapproved her, she turned him down! Meta and Joe were still not be forthcoming about their marriage, until Kathy overheard them talking one day and found out about the whole marriage! Kathy was livid that her father would betray her and Joey and their feelings regarding Peggy and wound up moving out of Joe's house and getting an apartment with a model that worked for Bill's advertising agency, Alice Graham. Then Kathy decided to accept Bob Lang's marriage proposal only telling Alice and Dick that she was marrying the man! Dick was not thrilled about this union, and when Kathy ended up getting pregnant with Bob's child, neither was she! For Bob, in marriage, became abusive and Kathy was unfortunately his #1 target for the abuse. Finally having enough of the abuse, in the spring of 1952, Kathy moved out of the house she shared with Bob, and moved back in with Alice, who wasn't too thrilled to have a mother-to-be, as her roommate. Dick tried to get Kathy to divorce Bob, but she refused. But unknown to Kathy, Joe found out about his daughter being pregnant and then got her and Bob's marriage annulled. But in the summer of 1952, Bob was very unhappy about the marriage being ended and tried to force Kathy back into their sham of a marriage, but Kathy refused. So Bob tried to woo her, by becoming as romantic as he could, but Kathy still didn't budge, but agreed to see Bob, even while she was dating Dick.

40|$|The Danish classic Karen Blixen (1885 – 1962) wrote both in English and Danish and she {{is better}} known for the English-reading {{audience}} by her pseudonym Isak Dinesen. The article takes its departure from two extremes in her reception. The first extreme is the paramount interest in her person and life, {{and the other one}} is the new-critical and post-structural rejection of her biography. The present article pursues the <b>middle</b> way. First <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> <b>this</b> is done by tracing the presence of the fictional construct of the author and the storyteller (however, in many ways related to Karen Blixen’s person) in her texts, such as “Babette’s Feast”, “The Young Man with the Carnation” and “Deluge at Norderney”. Second, the article demonstrates how Blixen’s texts sanction the audience’s freedom and imply that reception is part of the artistic act. Finally, it suggests that Blixen’s readers can return the generosity, which Blixen’s oeuvre demonstrates in their respect. This can be done by applying biographical material intertextually, when interpreting these stories or staging them in one’s mind – without any obligation to treat the writer’s person and life as the ultimate and stable source for the meaning of these stories...|$|R

The vengeful Vivian plots to have Maggie entombed in a crypt in the Kiriakis mausoleum, but as fate has it, ends up there herself. When Vivian is freed, {{she manages to}} entrap Maggie, and for days, her relatives are worried about her absence. Eventually, Victor finds her and she is rushed to the hospital. Maggie is stunned when she discovers that Victor knew Vivian was entrapped and did nothing about it. After Victor demands a divorce from Vivian, he begins to court Maggie. She struggles to accept Victor and his criminal past, but is able to build a relationship with him. Maggie and Victor begin to date and Victor proposes to Maggie in September 2011. During their engagement, Hope comes across a letter from Alice to Maggie, written the day before Alice died. Alice reminds Maggie about an experimental program she and Mickey entered into over thirty years prior, Maggie had attempted to harvest some of her eggs. Eventually she and Mickey abandoned the project, though the eggs were preserved. It was revealed that Daniel Jonas was her biological son, a product of these missing eggs. This also makes Melanie Layton her granddaughter. On November 8, 2011, Victor and Maggie get married. That Christmas Julie tells Maggie that she {{will always be a}} member of the Horton family, and extends an ornament to Victor, Daniel, and Melanie, despite their not being biological Hortons. In 2012, Maggie and Victor experience brief marital trouble when it is revealed that Victor knew about Maggie's missing eggs all those years. Maggie was eventually able to forgive him although she continues to keep him in line when his ruthless ways get the better of him. Maggie also said goodbye to Melanie, who left town. Additionally, Maggie opened her home to her nephew, Nick Fallon, Marie's grandson, who was recently paroled. Though Maggie has a new husband, son, granddaughter, and home, she is considered to be the matriarch of the Horton Family and still maintains a relationship with the members of the Horton family.In February 2016 her son Daniel Jonas was injured in a car accident that also injured Eric Brady, Brady Black and Jennifer Horton. He eventually dies from his injuries and Maggie makes the decision to take Daniel off Life Support and donate his heart to her Step-Grandson Brady.

Victor learned that Deimos had poisoned her and had an antidote which he would give Maggie on the condition that Victor turn all his assets over to him. Determined to save Maggie from instant death, Victor agreed.

6000|$|When the Spanish {{governor}} heard this, {{he calls}} to Will Atkins, [...] "How, Seignior Atkins, would you murder us all? What have {{you to say}} to that?"

Must we kill you, or you kill us? Why will you put us to the necessity of this, Seignior Atkins?" [...] says the Spaniard very calmly, and smiling. Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's making a jest of it, that, had he not been held by three men, and withal had no weapon near him, it was thought he would have attempted to kill the Spaniard in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the company. <b>This</b> hare-brained carriage obliged them to consider seriously what was to be done. The two Englishmen and the Spaniard who saved the poor savage were of the opinion that they should hang one of the three for an example to the rest, and that particularly it should be he that had twice attempted to commit murder with his hatchet; indeed, there was some reason to believe he had done it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable condition with the wound he had received that it was thought he could not live. But the governor Spaniard still said No; it was an Englishman that had saved all their lives, and he would never consent to put an Englishman to death, though he had murdered half of them; nay, he said if he had been killed himself by an Englishman, and had time left to speak, it should be that they should pardon him.|$|R
6000|$|After {{dinner the}} ball began, {{and it was}} the strangest ball that ever was seen. The trumpeter Gadfly and a number of his relations, besides several Grasshoppers and Bees, were the chief musicians. They wanted a bass very much at first, but the Bull-frog offered his services, {{although}} he confessed that he was accustomed to sing alone. Then the gentlemen drew on their gloves, flattened their wings, pulled up their collars, and coiled away their tails; while the ladies tightened their garters, ruffled their feathers, and put out their feelers. Oh how they did dance! reels were nothing to it. The greatest difficulty was to keep the Grasshoppers in order. They became so excited that they sprang quite out of sight every moment, and so lost their partners, and ran against everybody in searching for them. Then the Bull-frog, who sang bass, got a little too much of the dew, and sang so loudly, that he quite drowned all the other players. So Mrs Butterfly put her claws in her ears, and running up to him, said, [...] "Oh! dear Mr Bull-frog, pray do not sing quite so loudly." [...] The poor Bull-frog was almost weeping with joy at the merry scene before him, but he blushed very green on hearing this, and said he had forgotten what he was doing, but would try to be more careful. However, in five minutes more he was worse than ever, so they sent a few hundred bees to sing treble beside him, and try to keep him in order. In the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> there was a sudden stop, and a Snail, stepping forward, offered to dance a minuet. This was received with such a roar of laughter that the poor snail, half frightened, half angry, drew in his horns and went to bed on the spot, and the dance was begun anew. By this time the Gnats and Midges, {{and some of the other}} flies, had left the ground and retired to enjoy a cool dance in the air. Two or three Spiders mounted up into the oak, and fastened threads to some of the branches, by which they dropped suddenly down among the dancers, and, seizing their partners round the waist, carried them screaming in among the leaves. So the fun and the noise became louder and louder. On the ground, under the bushes, among the branches of the trees, and in the air, the dancers bounded, skipped, laughed, sang, shouted, and flew in a way that had never been seen or heard of before. The merry old Bull-frog became quite absurd. He sang and roared like a lion; took up all the young insects in his arms and hugged them; tumbled over the other musicians, and, in short, did so many wild things that they were at length obliged to tie him to a paddock-stool, where they left him to enjoy himself.|$|E
6000|$|In the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> {{bustle of}} reform planned, achieved, frustrated, and replanned, and the never-ending {{underground}} warfare that surges in a Native State, move the English officers--the irreducible minimum of exiles. As a caste, the working Englishmen in Native States are curiously interesting; and the traveller whose tact {{by this time}} has been blunted by tramping, sits in judgment upon them as he has seen them. In the first place, they are, they must be, the fittest who have survived; for though, here and there, you shall find one chafing bitterly against the burden {{of his life in}} the wilderness, one to be pitied more than any chained beast, the bulk of the caste are honestly and unaffectedly fond of their work, fond of the country around them, and fond of the people they deal with. In each State their answer to a question is the same. The men with whom they are in contact are [...] "all right" [...] when you know them, but you've got to [...] "know them first," [...] as the music-hall song says. Their hands are full of work; so full that, when the incult wanderer said: [...] "What do you find to do?" [...] they look upon him with contempt and amazement, exactly as the wanderer himself had once looked upon a Globe-trotter, who had put to him the same impertinent query. And--but here the Englishman may be wrong--it seemed to him that in one respect their lives were a good deal more restful and concentrated than those of their brethren under the British Government. There was no talk of shiftings and transfers and promotions, stretching across a Province and a half, and no man said anything about Simla. To one who has hitherto believed that Simla is the hub of the Empire, it is disconcerting to hear: [...] "Oh, Simla! That's where you Bengalis go. We haven't anything to do with Simla down here." [...] And no more they have. Their talk and their interests run in the boundaries of the States they serve, and, most striking of all, the gossipy element seems to be cut altogether. It is a backwater of the river of Anglo-Indian life--or is it the main current, the broad stream that supplies the motive power, and is the other life only the noisy ripple on the surface? You who have lived, not merely looked at, both lives, decide. Much can be learnt from the talk of the caste, many curious, many amusing, and some startling things. One hears stories of men who take a poor, impoverished State as a man takes a wife, [...] "for better or worse," [...] and, moved by some incomprehensible ideal of virtue, consecrate--that is not too big a word--consecrate their lives to that State in all single-heartedness and purity. Such men are few, but they exist to-day, and their names are great in lands where no Englishman travels. Again the listener hears tales of grizzled diplomats of Rajputana--Machiavellis who have hoisted a powerful intriguer with his own intrigue, and bested priestly cunning, and the guile of the Oswal, simply that the way might be clear for some scheme which should put money into a tottering Treasury, or lighten the taxation of a few hundred thousand men--or both; for this can be done. One tithe of that force spent on their own personal advancement would have carried such men very far.|$|E
