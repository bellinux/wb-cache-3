25|$|Lil Wayne has {{announced}} several possible upcoming projects, including a collaborative album entitled I Can't Feel <b>My</b> <b>Face</b> <b>with</b> Harlem-based rapper Juelz Santana, {{that has been}} in production for several years. On June 19, 2008, Lil Wayne and T-Pain formed a duo called T-Wayne with plans to release an album, titled He Raps, He Sings; however, those plans have died down due to much of the material recorded for the album being leaked. According to an interview with Drake, in the December 2011 issue of XXL, plans for an upcoming album with Lil Wayne had been scrapped for the time being because of the Jay-Z and Kanye West collaboration Watch the Throne (2011).|$|E
500|$|In 1921 {{the couple}} went to Europe where Tunis freelanced {{as a sports}} writer for American {{publications}} and played in some tennis tournaments on the Riviera, including a match against King Gustaf V of Sweden, who was 70 at the time. Tunis also played a doubles match against the French women's champion Suzanne Lenglen. Returning to the U.S. {{at the end of}} the summer, he dropped in on former Harvard classmate Lawrence Winship, the Sunday editor of The Boston Globe. When Winship learned that Tunis actually knew the flamboyant Lenglen, he insisted he write an article about her for the Globe before leaving the building. The pressure of that deadline caused him such anxiety that after half an hour of struggle he went to the building's fire escape, [...] "leaned over the railing, and threw up. I'll never forget it. I wiped <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> copy paper. But I did the story." [...] Between 1920 and 1940 Tunis freelanced for a number of major magazines, including Reader's Digest, Harper's, Atlantic Monthly, Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire, writing primarily on two topics: sports and education. He also covered sports for the New York Evening Post from 1925 to 1932 and had a weekly column in The New Yorker. According to Norman Cousins in Writing for Love or Money, Tunis was known for producing [...] "fact-packed articles based upon research". Working six days a week and taking the seventh to play tennis, Tunis published over 2,000 articles and short stories, becoming one ofAmerica's premier sportswriters.|$|E
60|$|She rose slowly. Her eyes {{rested on}} <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a dull, bewildered look.|$|E
60|$|She hesitated, searching <b>my</b> <b>face</b> earnestly <b>with</b> {{her large}} grave eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} <b>my</b> excited <b>face</b> <b>with</b> those red-brown eyes of his. Silently I defied {{him to speak}} his mind.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>face</b> flushed <b>with</b> {{answer as}} I {{looked in the}} {{direction}} indicated, and there saw in earnest converse with the Britishers, Elias Macomber, the traitor.|$|R
60|$|He {{looks up}} in <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> the patient {{expression}} {{of a man who}} listens to nonsense.|$|E
60|$|I {{gazed at}} him fixedly, taking my hands from <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>with</b> the tears still wet on my burning cheek.|$|E
60|$|She studied <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>with</b> {{a mental}} effort to {{remember}} me, which gathered her pretty eyebrows together quaintly in a frown.|$|E
60|$|My father moved {{nearer to}} me {{a step or}} two, and looked in <b>my</b> <b>face</b> intently, <b>with</b> the firm, {{penetrating}} expression which peculiarly characterized him.|$|R
6000|$|... "My father {{tells me}} that you wish to speak with me, so I have come," [...] {{she said in her}} low clear voice, searching <b>my</b> <b>face</b> curiously <b>with</b> her large eyes.|$|R
6000|$|Writing {{and talk}} do not prove me, [...] I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> [...] <b>With</b> the hush of my lips I wholly {{confound}} the skeptic.|$|R
60|$|She fired {{when she}} asked the last question, and she slapped <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> such force as she had, when I {{answered}} it.|$|E
60|$|My {{heart was}} sick with dread. Yet what could I do? I said nothing; only I covered <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> {{my hands and}} wept.|$|E
6000|$|... "Think of it, Thirza--that child! Why, it's {{only a year}} or two {{since she}} used to sit on my knee and tickle <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> her hair." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{pulled himself}} {{together}} {{and struggled to}} his feet. Then he looked round the room and finally into <b>my</b> anxious <b>face,</b> <b>with</b> an odd little laugh, strained and unnatural.|$|R
60|$|The old man {{frowned and}} shook his head; while she, after one swift, shy glance at <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and <b>with</b> {{something}} like a smile flitting over her delicate lips, turned and re-entered the house.|$|R
60|$|But {{he held up}} a thumb {{within a}} few inches of <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and <b>with</b> it a ring I had often noticed, a huge opal which he customarily wore on the inside of his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, nothing!" [...] {{answered}} Elinor, hastily. [...] "You paint <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> {{your own}} fantasies. Well, {{come for me}} tomorrow, and we will visit this wonderful artist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Russ, you swore you'd do {{something}} terrible if I tempted you anymore," [...] she faltered. The way she searched <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> doubtful, fearful eyes hurt me.|$|E
6000|$|Harry held up {{the candle}} and looked in <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> great deliberation. [...] "Jim, my boy," [...] he said quietly, [...] "you've been having too much whisky." ...|$|E
60|$|She did unbend a little. She {{put forward}} a hand--such a gracious, stooping {{attitude}} it was--and she pressed back my head. Then she looked into <b>my</b> upturned <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a very wistful smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am overwhelmed; I cannot speak. <b>My</b> <b>face</b> burns <b>with</b> shame; I have miscalculated my {{strength}} of mind, perhaps my physical strength; what, what must {{you think of}} me?" [...] She spoke in a low and smothered voice.|$|R
6000|$|I lied to him <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and <b>with</b> <b>my</b> eyes, {{and with}} my lips. [...] "It is no dream," [...] I said softly. [...] "I have come to you, Adrian, because I want you. No one else would do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A narrow shave, friend,' quoth Reuben, {{with his}} hand to his cheek. 'He hath tattooed <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> powder until I shall be taken for Solomon Sprent's younger brother.' ...|$|E
60|$|Her eyes {{rested on}} <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a strange look of inquiry in them. She {{did not appear}} to be {{surprised}} or confused at my venturing to address her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hi! who's washing <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> snow?" [...] cried Tom, as {{he opened}} his eyes and sat up. [...] "That's a mean trick, Dick, on a fellow who is dead tired out." ...|$|E
60|$|He held up {{his hands}} for a moment, as though to shut out the sight of <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> ablaze <b>with</b> scorn and hatred. There was a short silence. Then he spoke in a low tone, {{vibrating}} with intensity of feeling.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we will mask no more," [...] said Edward. [...] "Thou hast {{looked in}} <b>my</b> <b>face</b> long enough <b>with</b> those great black eyes. Dost know me, child?" ...|$|R
60|$|Philippina sober {{was awakened}} {{the next morning}} by the fingers of Mrs Monnerie herself. She must have {{withdrawn}} the kindly sheet from <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and, <b>with</b> nightmare still babbling on my lips, I {{looked up into the}} familiar features, a little grey and anxious, but creased up into every appearance of goodwill.|$|R
60|$|I heard Lucy's {{involuntary}} sob, as if {{she gasped}} for breath; and, turning, I saw her sweet eyes bent on <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> an expression of thankfulness {{that could not be}} mistaken.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Etherington met me at {{the door}} of his appartement, and led me to an inner room without speaking. Here he stood gazing, for some time, in <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>with</b> {{paternal}} concern.|$|E
6000|$|... "From Willie Liston?" [...] exclaimed the lady, {{starting}} up, and seizing my arm, {{while she}} gazed into <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>with</b> {{a look of}} wild surprise. [...] "Is he--but it cannot be--impossible--he must be--" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{approached}} to take it: a welcome gift it was. He examined <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> I thought, <b>with</b> austerity, as I came near: {{the traces of}} tears were doubtless very visible upon it.|$|R
60|$|AFTER {{taking off}} my riding-habit, and cooling <b>my</b> hot <b>face</b> <b>with</b> eau-de-cologne and water, I {{went down to}} the room which we called the morning-room. The piano there was my {{favorite}} instrument and I had the idea of trying what music would do toward helping me to compose myself.|$|R
6000|$|Bessie (Pain and shame). Oh!.... What are {{you waiting}} for? If I had more money I would give it all, all. I would give {{everything}} I have to make you go--to make you forget you had ever heard my voice and seen <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> (Covers <b>face</b> <b>with</b> hands.) ...|$|R
