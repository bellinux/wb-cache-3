50|$|The {{cerebral}} palsy sport classification {{system is designed}} for people with several types of paralysis and movement including quadriplegia, triplegia, diplegia, hemiplegia, <b>monoplegia,</b> spasticity, athetosis, and ataxia. Quadriplegia impacts the whole body, including the head, torso and all the limbs. Triplegia impacts {{three of the four}} limbs. Diplegia is when there is greater functional use of the lower limbs than the upper limbs. Hemiplegia, is a type of paralysis that effects one side of the body. <b>Monoplegia</b> is a condition that impacts only one limb. Spasticity limits muscle movement as a result of tightness in muscle.|$|E

50|$|<b>Monoplegia</b> {{is often}} a result to damage to the brain or spinal cord that manage motor {{functions}} of the affected limb.

50|$|In medicine, <b>monoplegia</b> is a {{paralysis}} of {{a single}} limb, usually an arm. It is frequently associated with cerebral palsy. This is the mildest form of cerebral palsy, and individuals with it generally have a good prognosis for later life. It {{can also be used}} if just one muscle group or muscle is affected. It is often thought as hemiplegia with much less involvement of the other limb.|$|E
50|$|When the cyst {{occurs in}} the brain, as it often does, the {{infected}} individual may experience headaches, seizures, vomiting, paralysis affecting {{one side of the}} body (hemiplegia), paralysis involving one limb (<b>monoplegia),</b> and loss of ability to coordinate muscles and muscle movements. Many of these symptoms are due to the buildup of inter-cranial pressure from the growing cyst or from the cyst pressing on other parts of brain.|$|E
50|$|Spastic quadriplegia, while {{affecting}} {{all four}} limbs {{more or less}} equally, can still present {{parts of the body}} as stiffer than others, such as one arm being tighter than another arm, and so forth. Spastic triplegia, meanwhile, involves three limbs (such as one arm and two legs, or one leg and two arms, etc.); spastic diplegia affects two limbs (commonly just the legs), spastic hemiplegia affects one or another entire side of the body (left or right); and spastic <b>monoplegia</b> involves a single limb.|$|E
5000|$|Paraplegia is an {{impairment}} in motor or sensory {{function of the}} lower extremities. The word comes from Ionic Greek παραπληγίη [...] "half-striking". It is usually caused by spinal cord injury or a congenital condition that affects the neural (brain) elements of the spinal canal. The area of the spinal canal that is affected in paraplegia is either the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral regions. Common victims of this impairment are veterans or members of the armed forces. If four limbs are affected by paralysis, tetraplegia or quadriplegia is the correct term. If only one limb is affected, the correct term is <b>monoplegia.</b>|$|E

After 1998, smaller EV71 epidemics occurred almost annually in Taiwan, primarily associated with EV71 viruses of genotypes C2 and B4. In Malaysia, EV71 outbreaks occurred in 1997 and 2000, mainly associated with genotypes B3 and B4. Since 1997, EV71 epidemics (genotypes B and C) have been reported annually in Singapore, with genotype B4 forming the predominant causative agent of a large outbreak in 2000 (5).

50|$|Spastic {{hemiplegia}} (one side being affected). Generally, {{injury to}} muscle-nerves {{controlled by the}} brain's left side will cause a right body deficit, and vice versa. Typically, people that have spastic hemiplegia are the most ambulatory, although they generally have dynamic equinus on the affected side and are primarily prescribed ankle-foot orthoses to prevent said equinus.11Spastic diplegia (the lower extremities are affected with little to no upper-body spasticity). The {{most common form of}} the spastic forms. Most people with spastic diplegia are fully ambulatory and have a scissors gait. Flexed knees and hips to varying degrees are common. Hip problems, dislocations, and in three-quarters of spastic diplegics, also strabismus (crossed eyes), can be present as well. In addition, these individuals are often nearsighted. The intelligence of a person with spastic diplegia is unaffected by the condition.Spastic tetraplegia (all four limbs affected equally). People with spastic quadriplegia are the least {{likely to be able to}} walk, or if they can, to want to walk, because their muscles are too tight and it is too much effort to do so. Some children with quadriplegia also have hemiparetic tremors, an uncontrollable shaking that affects the limbs on one side of the body and impairs normal movement.Occasionally, terms such as <b>monoplegia,</b> paraplegia, triplegia, and pentaplegia may also be used to refer to specific manifestations of the spasticity.|$|E

Despite many advances in research and treatment modalities, the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury remains unclear, and morbidity and mortality among these patients remain high.

All animal care and procedures {{were in accordance with}} the CPCSEA and National Institute of Health guidelines. Thirty Wistar rats with <b>monoplegia</b> following surgical hemitransection of the spinal cord were used for the study.

Spinal cord injury model of Wistar rats in the test group were treated by infusing a combination of neurotransmitters and bone marrow at the site of injury using a special polythene tube and reservoir for 21 days. In the control group of rats with <b>monoplegia,</b> normal saline was infused at the site of injury for 21 days. The observations are recorded along with results.
