5|$|Bourekas are savory {{pastries}} {{brought to}} Israel by Jews from Turkey, the Balkans and Salonika. They {{are made of}} a flaky dough {{in a variety of}} shapes, frequently topped with sesame seeds, and are filled with meat, chickpeas, cheese, spinach, potatoes or mushrooms. Bourekas are sold at kiosks, supermarkets and cafes, and are served at functions and celebrations, as well as being prepared by home cooks. They are often served as a light <b>meal</b> <b>with</b> hardboiled eggs and chopped vegetable salad.|$|E
5|$|Fish, {{traditionally}} carp, but now other firm {{white fish}} too, are minced and shaped into loaves or balls and cooked in fish broth, {{such as the}} gefilte fish of the Ashkenazi Jews, who also brought pickled herring from Eastern Europe. Herring is often served at the kiddush that follows synagogue services on Shabbat, especially in Ashkenazi communities. In the Russian immigrant community it may be served as a light <b>meal</b> <b>with</b> boiled potatoes, sour cream, dark breads and schnapps or vodka.|$|E

5|$|Sandwiches usually using markook or khubz, such as Shawarma and Falafel {{are also}} common bread meals. Shawarma {{can be served}} as a {{sandwich}} or <b>meal</b> <b>with</b> shaved meat and bread. Shawarma can be chicken or beef, and is adorned {{with a variety of}} garnishes. These can include pickles, hummus, or a garlic yogurt mix. Falafel, fried chickpeas, parsley and onion are fried into small patties and are adorned with similar toppings as shawarma.|$|E
5|$|Around AD 30, Jesus and his {{followers}} traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover. Jesus caused a disturbance in the Second Temple, which {{was the center of}} Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. Jesus had a last <b>meal</b> <b>with</b> his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. Jesus' words are recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. The differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and {{it is impossible to know}} what Jesus intended, but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming Kingdom. Jesus probably expected to be killed, and he may have hoped that God would intervene.|$|E
5|$|When he was 24, {{his work}} with the United States Navy {{involved}} going to Australia and he deserted again, this time in Melbourne. There, he met Charlie Peters, who invited him to his home to have a <b>meal</b> <b>with</b> his family including Jessie, Peters' 23-year-old daughter. Jessie and Jenner married a year later, on 6 July 1929, at HMAS Cerberus. They continued to live in Melbourne after their wedding and Jenner joined the Royal Australian Navy. He soon {{became one of the}} sailors assigned to travel to England to retrieve HMAS Canberra. He was serving on HMAS Australia in 1937 when he was legally discharged from the navy, buying his way out but not receiving a pension.|$|E

5|$|In mid-February 1944, Lukačević, Baćović {{and another}} officer {{accompanied}} Bailey {{to the coast}} south of Dubrovnik and were evacuated from Cavtat by a Royal Navy gunboat. Their passage through German-occupied territory was probably facilitated by Lukačević's accommodation with the Germans. At one point, Lukačević was invited to have a <b>meal</b> <b>with</b> the German garrison commander of a nearby town, but declined the offer. Lukačević and the others then travelled via Cairo to London, where Lukačević represented Mihailović at King Peter's wedding on 20 March 1944. After the British government decided to withdraw support from Mihailović, Lukačević and his Chetnik companions {{were not allowed to}} return to Yugoslavia until the British mission to Mihailović headed by Armstrong had been safely evacuated from occupied territory. Lukačević and the others were detained by the British in Bari and thoroughly searched by local authorities, who suspected them of a robbery that had occurred in the Yugoslav consulate in Cairo a short time before. Most of the money, jewelry and uncensored letters that they were carrying were impounded. The men were flown out of Bari on 30 May, and landed on an improvised airfield at Pranjani northwest of Čačak shortly after. Because their landing at Pranjani coincided with Armstrong's departure, Lukačević and Baćović demanded that Armstrong be held as a hostage until their impounded belongings could be returned from Bari. The Chetniks at the airfield refused to keep Armstrong any further, and he was allowed to depart without incident.|$|E
