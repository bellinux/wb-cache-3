40|$|The UK Economic Impact Study (UKEIS), {{commissioned}} by the Meeting Professionals International (MPI) Foundation and undertaken by Leeds Metropolitan University, represents a landmark study for the UK <b>meeting</b> <b>industry.</b> It is, to date, the most comprehensive assessment of {{the economic impact of}} the industry on the British economy. Although there has been growing recognition that the <b>meeting</b> <b>industry</b> makes a substantial economic contribution, the evidence base to support such a claim has, until now, been fragmented. Several valuable studies have been undertaken in recent years that have incorporated elements of the <b>meeting</b> <b>industry,</b> but their approach to economic modelling and data gathering have varied significantly. The lack of consistency and alignment with international standards has also prevented comparison between the value of the industry in one country and another. More importantly, it has made it difficult for the representatives of the <b>meeting</b> <b>industry</b> to provide evidence of its significance effectively. In order to provide a comprehensive profile of the UK <b>meeting</b> <b>industry</b> and to measure its economic impact robustly, the UKEIS adopted a framework designed by the UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) for measuring the sector’s economic importance. 3 This framework has been used for similar studies of the <b>meeting</b> <b>industry</b> in the USA, Canada, Mexico, Australia and Denmark. One of its particular strengths is that it connects with official national accounting systems, specifically Tourism Satellite Accounts...|$|E

40|$|Meetings {{of varying}} forms have been omnipresent in society; however {{in recent years}} the <b>meetings</b> <b>industry</b> has been universally {{acknowledged}} by academics as expanding rapidly and as a result is developing into one of the fastest growing, most competitive and lucrative sectors of the global tourism industry. A destination’s desire to attract the <b>meetings</b> <b>industry</b> is primarily due to its significant economic contributions; undeniably it is recognised as the high-quality, high-yield end of the tourism spectrum. Previous research has focused primarily on the motivations of delegates and the site selection decision making process of meeting planners, both of which destination image was a factor. Therefore this research project was created with the overarching aim of interviewing Edinburgh and Glasgow industry professionals (at government, convention bureau and meeting facility level) to obtain their views on the connections between, and use of, a destination’s image and the <b>meetings</b> <b>industry.</b> While the specific type of meeting was not stipulated by the researcher site selection is foremost concerned with associations meetings due to their relative flexibility. The researcher deemed semi structured interviews as the most appropriate research method; an interview is naturally heuristic and therefore allows ideas to be developed and discussed which links to the exploratory nature of the research project. The results demonstrated the industry professional’s beliefs that there are multiple attributes of a destination which attracts the <b>meetings</b> <b>industry</b> which supports the concept discovered in the literature that site selection is a complex process with multiple variables; however many attributes were used to describe both cities therefore presenting possible issues with homogenisation despite the necessity for destination’s to differentiate themselves from their competition. Collaboration was identified as a prerequisite within the industry demonstrating a need for the numerous stakeholders to work together to ensure successful selling of the destination and production of the meeting. This research project has provided an exploratory industry professional’s view on the connections between the <b>meetings</b> <b>industry</b> and destination image; the semi structured interviews allowed a vast amount and range of results which, as any research project should, has both contributed to existing knowledge and created recommendations for future research within the <b>meetings</b> <b>industry...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to examine how {{important}} marketing and networking is for the <b>meeting</b> <b>industry</b> in Stockholm. The <b>meeting</b> <b>industry</b> {{is one of the}} most profitable areas of the tourism industry today and a major contributor to economic growth in Sweden. The <b>meeting</b> <b>industry</b> has grown rapidly in Sweden and Stockholm has during the last five years been one of the ten most popular congress cities in the world. This has resulted in that the city has become a strong competitor to other European cities. Stockholm International fairs are for example the largest trade fair organizer in Scandinavia and Stockholm Waterfront Congress Centre is the new arena of opportunity. However the marketing and a broad network is necessary for meeting facilities if their aim is to be successful. Marketing contributes to the meeting facilities establishment and makes it well known for the potential market, while the collaborations and relationships is important for facilitating their work. Today there is a discussion whether there has been a paradigm shift from traditional transaction marketing to relationship marketing; it means that it is more important today with relationships in all aspects and not just exchanges with unknown parties. Relationships and networks are therefore a strong key feature in the <b>meeting</b> <b>industry</b> and relationship marketing are becoming increasingly important for meeting facilities and conference industry. ...|$|E

It can be assumed that the technology could replace some of the personal meetings, but humans have always had a need to meet in physical locations in work related purposes, therefore {{there is no evidence that}} personal meetings will disappear. Technological development should be seen as complementary rather than a substitute to the existing professional meetings. Public and private sectors within countries has drawn attention to meeting industry's potential, as favored destinations in terms of economic administration, image creation, expansion and acquisition of further market share in the global market. <b>Meeting</b> <b>industry</b> is complex precisely because there are so many different actors and stakeholders that integrate. For a destination to differentiate them and excel in the increasingly global world needed an elaborate marketing plan and effective cooperation between the various actors at the destination. Usually the largest professional meetings takes place in cities where there is capacity to receive large numbers of visitors. Essential elements for sustainable <b>meeting</b> <b>industry</b> are mutually dependent network relationships with strong organizational skills, and are of primary importance to a functioning whole. Among the various meeting actors, Convention Bureau occupy key role as the representative, the primary aim is to market the destination, display options, and finally bring together stakeholders with meeting participants.
