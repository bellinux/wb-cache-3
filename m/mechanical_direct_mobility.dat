The analyses show that, in Germany’s rigid labour market, <b>direct</b> voluntary job <b>mobility</b> brings permanent income rewards. Indirect job mobility, on the other hand, has a long-lasting scar effect for voluntary job movers. In contrast, in the UK not only voluntary <b>direct</b> job <b>mobility</b> but also voluntary indirect job mobility is rewarded by income gains. ...|$|R

An effort for analyzing derived <b>mobility</b> metrics with <b>direct</b> <b>mobility</b> metrics are considered across Manhattan and Freeway mobility model in this article. This article extends an intuitive study to analyze impact of mobility models on two prominent reactive {{routing protocols}} i. e. ad-hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) and dynamic source routing (DSR) with fixed network size, varying node speed and identical traffic load...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new kind of ambient {{calculus}} in which the open capability is replaced by <b>direct</b> <b>mobility</b> of generic processes. The calculus comes equipped with a labelled transition system in which types play a major role: this system allows us to show interesting algebraic laws. As usual, types express the communication, access and mobility properties of the modelled system, and inferred types express the minimal constraints required for the system to be well behave...|$|R

25|$|Electrical {{typewriter}} designs {{removed the}} <b>direct</b> <b>mechanical</b> {{connection between the}} keys and the element that struck the paper. Not {{to be confused with}} later electronic typewriters, electric typewriters contained only a single electrical component: the motor. Where the keystroke had previously moved a typebar directly, now it engaged <b>mechanical</b> linkages that <b>directed</b> <b>mechanical</b> power from the motor into the typebar.|$|R
40|$|In <b>direct</b> <b>mobility</b> {{experiments}} in single crystals, dislocation velocity is studied {{as a function}} of stress by the application of short-duration stress pulses. The stress pulse consists of a loading wave, followed microseconds later, by an unloading wave. At high velocities, dislocation inertia effects become important if the dislocation damping force is a decreasing function of dislocation velocity. In general, the magnitude of this force can be determined only if the relative velocity between the applied stress wave and the dislocation is considered...|$|R
40|$|A {{new kind}} of ambient calculi is presented, where the open {{capability}} is replaced by <b>direct</b> <b>mobility</b> of naked processes, while the associated type systems are algorithmic {{in the sense that}} they directly provide type inference procedures. The calculus comes equipped with a labelled transition system in which types play a major role: this system allows us to show interesting algebraic laws. Types express, as usual, the communication, access and mobility properties of the modelled system; inferred types express the minimal constraints required for the system to well behave...|$|R
5000|$|The 300 Sc (W188) {{appeared}} in 1955, featuring upgrades to both its engine and suspension. Following the high-performance 300SL Gullwing's lead a year earlier, the Sc's inline-six received {{a version of}} its <b>mechanical</b> <b>direct</b> fuel-injection, which delivered a slightly detuned [...] at 5400 rpm. Mercedes-Benz's [...] "low-pivot" [...] independent suspension was fitted in the rear.

5000|$|Sharing the {{pioneering}} 300SL sports car's Bosch <b>mechanical</b> <b>direct</b> injection with 300Sc, the 300d's M189 engine produced [...] at 5500 rpm. Automatic transmission was standard.A total of 3,077 300d models (priced at DM 27,000) was produced through March 1962, along with 65 special-order 300d-based Cabriolet Ds (DM 35,500). After some overlap with the smaller, more contemporary styled W112 chassied 300SE that shared its engine, the 300d limousine was ultimately replaced as company flagship in 1963 by the 600 pullman [...] "Grand Mercedes".|$|R

40|$|Optomechanical {{devices have}} been cooled to {{ground-state}} and genuine quantum features, {{as well as}} long-predicted nonlinear phenomena, have been observed. When packing close enough more than one optomechanical unit in the same substrate the question arises as to whether collective or independent dissipation channels are the correct description of the system. Here we explore the effects arising when introducing dissipative couplings between mechanical degrees of freedom. We investigate synchronization, entanglement and cooling, finding that collective dissipation can drive synchronization {{even in the absence}} of <b>mechanical</b> <b>direct</b> coupling, and allow to attain larger entanglement and optomechanical cooling. The mechanisms responsible for these enhancements are explored and provide a full and consistent picture...|$|R
5000|$|The {{resulting}} Jumo 211 {{was first}} prototyped at Jumo's Dessau plant in 1935 and started testing in April 1936. Like the 210H, it featured a <b>mechanical</b> <b>direct</b> {{fuel injection system}} using small pistons driven off the crankshaft, three valves per cylinder, and an inverted V layout. It also had an open-cycle cooling system, not pressurized, {{as was the case}} on the later 213. Limited production of the [...] Jumo 211A started in April 1937 at Dessau, with just over 1,000 completed before full production was started at Magdeburg in July [...] Three models were provided with varied settings for its two-speed supercharger, tuned for different low- versus high-altitude performance.|$|R
40|$|A mobile ad hoc {{network is}} {{collection}} of self configuring and adaption of wireless link between communicating devices (mobile devices) {{to form an}} arbitrary topology and multihop wireless connectivity {{without the use of}} existing infrastructure. It requires efficient dynamic routing protocol to determine the routes subsequent to a set of rules that enables two or more devices to communicate with each others. This paper basically classifies and evaluates the mobility metrics into two categories- <b>direct</b> <b>mobility</b> metrics and derived mobility metrics. These two mobility metrics has been used to measure different mobility models, this paper considers some of mobility models i. e Random Waypoint Model, Reference Point Group Mobility Model, Random Direction Mobility Model, Random Walk Mobility Model, Probabilistic Random Walk, Gauss Markov, Column Mobility Model, Nomadic Community Mobility Model and Manhattan Grid Model...|$|R

50|$|From 1984 {{until late}} 1995, the DT engines used a Bosch pump-line-nozzle (PLN) <b>mechanical</b> <b>direct</b> fuel {{injection}} system. 1984 through 1992 DTs used a Bosch MW style pump, while the 1993-1995s used a Bosch P style pump, and starting {{what was called}} New Generation Diesel engine design, which {{is still the same}} basic block design. Mechanical injection was still utilized in trucks up into the 1997 year, but this is rare. In 1994, due to tightening emissions regulations, the engines were redesigned to use electronically controlled unit direct fuel injection. From 1994 to 2004, the engines used HEUI (Hydraulically actuated Electronically controlled Unit Injection) injectors, co-developed by Navistar and Caterpillar. http://www.internationaldelivers.com/assets/pdf/dyk267.pdf From 2004 to 2009, the engines use International's Electro-Hydraulic Generation Two (G2) unit injectors.|$|R
50|$|The 4 VD 14,5/12-1 SRW is a {{water-cooled}} four-stroke {{diesel engine}} with four inline cylinders. The Fuel is injected with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>direct</b> injection system. The bore is 120 mm, the stroke is 145 mm, the displacement is 6560 cm³. The firing order is 1-3-4-2. The standard {{version of the}} engine produces 92 kW and has a torque of 422 Nm. The combustion chamber system was licensed by MAN. The engine was produced in the versions 4 VD 14,5/12-1 SRW and 4 VD 14,5/12-2 SRW, the later revision was built primary for the NVA.

40|$|In this article, {{we address}} {{the current debate}} of {{increasing}} work life flexibility in (West-) Germany. In order to {{shed some light on}} the contradiction between a widely accepted decrease in work life stability and empirical findings that do not confirm such a decline, we contrast "objective" evidence from occupational trajectories with "subjective" evidence on various dimensions of perceived continuity and discontinuity of job histories. We use the West German part of the German Life History Study for a survival analysis of occupational mobility for cohorts born between 1929 and 1971. Here, using a new concept, we distinguish between <b>direct</b> <b>mobility</b> and indirect mobility which is defined as an occupational change that happens after an employment interruption. In addition, we analyze a new German cross-sectional data set from 2005 on retrospective career perceptions. We employ multinomial regression models to understand whether younger individuals report more unwanted occupational mobility and employment interruptions than older individuals. Our findings indicate that <b>direct</b> occupational <b>mobility</b> has neither increased across cohorts nor has it surged upward for the most recent cohorts, but that there has been an increase in indirect occupational mobility. Furthermore, while there is no higher incidence of unwanted occupational mobility in younger age groups, we find mixed evidence regarding the increased occurrence of unwanted career interruptions in younger age groups. Finally, the desire to experience occupational and firm changes has grown for younger age groups...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of the sulfur atom of the methionine side chain exerts significant effects at different levels on biochemical behavior of chemotactic N-formylpeptides. In order to acquire {{more information on this}} point, the synthesis, the conformation in the crystal, and the activity of For-Hse(Me) -Leu-Phe-OMe (2) [...] an oxygen analogue of For-Met-Leu-Phe-OMe (fMLP-OMe) containing the O-methyl-L-homoserine in place of the native methionine at position 1 [...] is reported. The new analogue 2 adopts a conformation that is extended at the first two residues and folded at the C-terminal phenylalanine. This conformation is {{different from that of the}} parent fMLP-OMe and strikingly similar to that adopted by fMLP-OBu(t). The side-chain spatial orientation of 2 corresponds to that adopted by fMLP-OH when cocrystallized with an immunoglobulin possessing binding properties similar to those of neutrophil receptors. When tested on human neutrophils the formylpeptide 2 is more active than the parent in the stimulation of <b>directed</b> <b>mobility</b> and maintains both the granule enzyme release activity and the superoxide anion production...|$|R
5000|$|The W196's 2,496.87 cc (76.0 x 68.8 mm) straight-8 {{was bored}} and stroked to 2,981.70 cc (78.0 x 78.0 mm), {{boosting}} output from [...] at 8,500 rpm to about [...] at 7,400 rpm, depending on intake manifold. Maximum torque was 318 Nm at 5,950 rpm ( [...] BMEP). Like the W196, {{the engine was}} canted to the right at 33-degrees to lower the car's profile, resulting in slicker aerodynamics and a distinctive bulge {{on the passenger side}} of the hood shared with the streamlined Type Monza Formula one car. To reduce crank flexing, power takeoff was {{from the center of the}} engine via a gear rather than at the end of the crankshaft. Other notable features were desmodromic valves, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>direct</b> fuel injection derived from the DB 601 high-performance V12 used on the Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighter during World War II.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPrevious study {{demonstrated}} that WASP localizes on vesicles during Dictyostelium chemotaxis and these vesicles {{appear to be}} preferentially distributed at the leading and trailing edge of migrating cells. In this study, we have examined the role of PCH family proteins, Nwk/Bzz 1 p-like protein (NLP) and Syndapin-like protein (SLP), in the regulation of the formation and trafficking of WASP-vesicles during chemotaxis. NLP and SLP appear to be functionally redundant and deletion of both nlp and slp genes causes the loss of polarized F-actin organization and significant defects in chemotaxis. WASP and NLP are colocalized on vesicles and interactions between two molecules via the SH 3 domain of NLP/SLP and the proline-rich repeats of WASP are required for vesicle formation from Golgi. Microtubules are required for polarized trafficking of these vesicles as vesicles showing high <b>directed</b> <b>mobility</b> are absent in cells treated with nocodazole. Our results suggest that interaction of WASP with NLP/SLP {{is required for the}} formation and trafficking of vesicles from Golgi to the membrane, which might {{play a central role in}} the establishment of cell polarity during chemotaxis...|$|R
