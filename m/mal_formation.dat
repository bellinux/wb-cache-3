40|$|CwlD has {{sequence}} {{similarities to}} N-acetyl muramoyl-L-alanine amidases, {{a class of}} enzymes known to cleave the bond between the peptide side chain and the N-acetyl muramic acid residue in cortex peptidoglycan formation during sporulation. A major difference between vegetative peptidoglycan and spore peptidoglycan {{is the presence of}} muramic-lactam (MAL) in spore peptidoglycan. It was previously determined that a null mutant does not contain muramic [...] lactam in the spore cortex peptidoglycan and the mutant spores were unable to complete germination. Therefore, it is believed that CwlD plays a role in <b>MAL</b> <b>formation</b> during sporulation. However, the specific role of the protein had not been demonstrated. It was also previously found that is in a two-gene operon with. Orf 1 is produced within the forespore with CwlD. The hypothesized role of Orf 1 is to inhibit CwlD activity from within the forespore. Muramoyl-L-alanine amidase activity was demonstrated by CwlD. Therefore, CwlD is carrying out the first step of MAL synthesis, cleaving the peptide side chain while other enzymes are needed to complete <b>MAL</b> <b>formation.</b> Two different forms of CwlD were over-expressed, with and without the protein’s signal peptide sequence.

Congenital ocular <b>mal</b> <b>formations</b> (OMs) {{are probably the most}} frequent geneti« cause of blind ness in childhood, but data on their incidence are not available as most studies regard selected pediatric samples with no distinction between eye malformations and disease.

40|$|Lymphangiomas are benign {{tumors of the}} lymphatic vessels with {{expansive}} and infiltrating growth. They are innate and {{belong to}} the congenital vascular malformation (CVM). In Contrary to other vascular <b>mal</b> <b>formations</b> a constant and inexorable size increase exists. Spontaneous involution is only rarely seen. Due to infiltration of the adjacent soft parts and organs complications result, this {{may lead to a}} loss of function of these structures. lymphangiomas are therefore independently of their size in need of treatment. The treatment of children with lymphangiomas is subject of the discussion {{for more than two decades}} now. Still guidelines are missing. Radical tumor excision as the standard is unchanged. Alternative methods to replace or supplement operation could not convince and aren´t generally accepted. Thus the sclerosing technique failed in particular on microcystic lymphangiomas. Laser treatment of lymphangiomas does not only represent a substantial easement with increase of the efficiency and reduction of costs, but is connected also with a substantially smaller load, morbidity rate, a lethality rate and therapy-needy defects. The number of complications is small, likewise the number of recurrents. An advantage of laser therapy is the possibility of treating and completely to exterminate also of microcystic lesions, so that treatment is able without major defects. Laser treatment of lymphangiomas therefore can be an effectual addition to operation and sclerosing technique, but may be a valuable alternative to the operation and the traditional therapy forms...|$|R

40|$|The {{recognition}} of bacterial lipoproteins by toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 is pivotal for inflammation initiation and control in many bacterial infections. TLR 2 -dependent signalling is currently believed to essentially require both adaptor proteins MyD 88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88) and Mal/TIRAP (MyD 88 -adapter-like/TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein). TLR 2 -dependent, but MyD 88 -independent responses {{have not been}} described yet. We report here on a novel-signalling pathway downstream of TLR 2, which does not adhere to the established model. On stimulation of the TLR 2 / 6 heterodimer with diacylated bacterial lipoproteins, Mal directly interacts with the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), p 85 alpha, in an inducible fashion. The Mal-p 85 alpha interaction drives PI 3 K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt, phosphatidylinositol(3, 4, 5) P 3 (PIP(3)) generation and macrophage polarization. MyD 88 is not essential for PI 3 K activation and Akt phosphorylation; however, cooperates with <b>Mal</b> for PIP(3) <b>formation</b> and accumulation at the leading edge. In contrast to TLR 2 / 6, TLR 2 / 1 does not require Mal or MyD 88 for Akt phosphorylation. Hence, Mal specifically connects TLR 2 / 6 to PI 3 K activation, PIP(3) generation and macrophage polarization...|$|R
40|$|T cell {{membrane}} receptors and signaling molecules assemble at the immunological synapse (IS) in a supramolecular activation cluster (SMAC), organized into two differentiated subdomains: the central SMAC (cSMAC), with the TCR, Lck, and linker for activation of T cells (LAT), and the peripheral SMAC (pSMAC), with adhesion molecules. The mechanism of protein sorting to the SMAC subdomains is still unknown. MAL forms {{part of the}} machinery for protein targeting to the plasma membrane by specialized mechanisms involving condensed membranes or rafts. In this article, we report our investigation {{of the dynamics of}} <b>MAL</b> during the <b>formation</b> of the IS and its role in SMAC assembly in the Jurkat T cell line and human primary T cells. We observed that under normal conditions, a pool of MAL rapidly accumulates at the cSMAC, where it colocalized with condensed membranes, as visualized with the membrane fluorescent probe Laurdan. Mislocalization of MAL to the pSMAC greatly reduced membrane condensation at the cSMAC and redistributed machinery involved in docking microtubules or transport vesicles from the cSMAC to the pSMAC. As a consequence of these alterations, the raft-associated molecules Lck and LAT, but not the TCR, were missorted to the pSMAC. MAL, therefore, regulates membrane order and the distribution of microtubule and transport vesicle docking machinery at the IS and, by doing so, ensures correct protein sorting of Lck and LAT to the cSMAC.
