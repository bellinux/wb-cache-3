40|$|The {{mineralogy}} and petrology of two kimberlites, {{a peripheral}} <b>monticellite</b> kimberlite, and its core of phlogopite kimberlite, from the West Auxiliary Pipe at Dutoitspan Mine are described. The mineralogy {{of the two}} kimberlites differs mainly {{in the presence of}} phlogopite macrocrysts, greater abundance of angular crustal inclusions, more heavy minerals and higher diamond grade in the phlogopite type. Microprobe analyses of olivine, phlogopite, <b>monticellite,</b> oxide minerals and garnet are presented. Silicate compositions are comparable in both kimberlites and zoning of olivine grains is typically towards a rim of Fo₈₉₋₉₀ʻ irrespective of whether cores are more Fe-rich or more Mg-rich. This is caused by re-equilibration after fluidised emplacement in the earth's crust of macrocryst-bearing kimberlite magma. Olivine aggregates were derived from sheared mantle lherzolite and single-crystal macrocrysts were formed at higher mantle levels from a kimberlitic crystal-mush magma. This was emplaced in the crust by rapid gas streaming. The post-fluidisation phenocrysts of olivine and phlogopite which formed then are in general more Fe-rich than macrocrysts. Re-equilibration of ilmenite results in the formation of complex perovskite and titanomagnetite mantles. Phlogopite macrocrysts are preserved in the <b>monticellite</b> contact rock where rapid quenching prevented their resorption and allowed separation of an immiscible carbonate melt, giving the abundant groundmass calcite. Atoll-textured spinels are found in the contact rock. Major and minor trace-element analyses of whole rock samples are presented and discussed, bringing into account the problem of contamination by crustal inclusions. Whole rock chemistry supports derivation of the kimberlites as partial melts of mantle material {{in the presence of a}} lithophile-element-enriched fluid. The <b>monticellite</b> contact rock is highly enriched in REE, Nb, and Sr due to rapid freezing of this perovskite-enriched phase. The <b>monticellite</b> type is more enriched in lithophile elements than the phlogopite type, which supports derivation of the <b>monticellite</b> type by a small degree of partial melting, further melting reducing the relative concentrations of lithophile elements to give the phlogopite kimberlite chemistry...|$|E
40|$|Almost monomineralic Mg-rich gehlenite (~Gh 50 Ak 46 Na-mel 4) skarns {{occur in}} a very {{restricted}} area along the contact of a diorite intrusion at Oravita, Banat, in Romania, elsewhere characterized by more typical vesuvianite–garnet skarns. In the apparently vein-like body of unaltered gehlenite, the textural relations of the associated minerals (interstitial granditic garnet and, locally, <b>monticellite,</b> rare cases of exsolution of magnetite in the core zone of melilite grains) suggest that the original composition of the gehlenite may have been different, richer in Si, Mg, Fe (and perhaps Na), {{in accordance with the}} fact that skarns are the only terrestrial type of occurrence of gehlenite-dominant melilite. The same minerals, <b>monticellite</b> and a granditic garnet, appear in the retrograde evolution of the Mg-rich gehlenite toward compositions richer in Al, the successive stages of which are clearly displayed, along with the final transformation to vesuvianite. These changes include (1) the local development of small rounded patches with Al-rich compositions (Gh 60 to Gh 85), accompanied by <b>monticellite,</b> spurrite (or tilleyite, afwillite, kilchoanite) and, at a later stage, a granditic garnet, and (2) the complete transformation of gehlenite to vesuvianite, associated with minor clintonite (+ <b>monticellite</b> and probably ellestadite), usually along a sharp front typically rimmed by a 0. 5 -mm-wide zone of Al-rich gehlenite (Gh 85). The gehlenite rim, as well as the gehlenite in the local modifications, show a remarkable correlation between the åkermanite and Na-melilite contents, probably of crystal-chemical origin. The local modifications (1) are interpreted as nearly closed-system (except for Na and Fe) retrograde reactions at moderate temperature (500 – 600 °C), controlled by the localized presence of small amounts of fluid at low pressure, mainly involving the transformation of the åkermanite component to <b>monticellite.</b> The silica released by this transformation resulted in the formation of spurrite (among others) and of the Na-melilite component at first, and garnet later. The subsequent transformation (2) of gehlenite to vesuvianite and clintonite, which involved silica metasomatism, may result from the more pervasive infiltration of the same fluid, at higher pressure, probably related {{to the development of the}} garnet–vesuvianite skarns elsewhere along the intrusive contacts...|$|E

The Gibeon kimberlite province contains at least 46 pipes and 16 major dykes of mainly basaltic kimberlite. The inclusions in kimberlite are divided into : (i) cognate nonomineralic nodules consisting of kelyphitized titanium-bearing pyrope, coated diopside, serpentinized olivine, coated ilmenite, and composite ilmenite-encased olivines; and (ii) accidental polymineralic nodules consisting of garnet peridotite, garnet pyroxenite, retrograde eclogite and granulite. The large phreatic volcano - Gross Brukkaros- is formedby a dome of Nama sediments. The centre of the dome contains depression, 1 1 / 2 miles in diameter, underlain by fine grained clastic rocks (microbreccias) derived from brecciat –tion of the Nama sediments.

The olivine-rich parts of P 2 -West are relatively fresh and consist of euhedral-to-subhedral micro-phenocrystal olivine set in a groundmass of fine-grained anhedral <b>monticellite,</b> amoeboid apatite, and subhedral-to-euhedral perovskite within a partially chloritized-to-fresh phlogopite-rich mesostasis.

40|$|A unique hybrid natrocarbonatite, {{collected}} from the new ash cone of the volcano Oldoinyo Lengai, Tanzania in July 2008, consists of phenocrysts of nyerereite and gregoryite together with xenocrysts of clinopyroxene, nepheline and Ti-andradite set in a groundmass of cuspidine, sodalite, ferroan manganoan <b>monticellite,</b> K-Fe sulphide and manganoan titanian magnetite and gregoryite. The xenocrysts were not in equilibrium with the melt which formed their current host, as clinopyroxenes and Ti-andradite are mantled by cuspidine, and nepheline by sodalite and phlogopitepotassian kinoshitalite solid solutions. A microxenolith of ijolite exhibits similar reaction phenomena. The minerals of the xenocryst suite have similar compositions to plutonic ijolites found at Oldoinyo Lengai, and are thus considered to be derived by the fragmentation of such material in a previously contaminated natrocarbonatite melt. The latter, which has cuspidine, sodalite and <b>monticellite</b> as primary liquidus phases, is considered to have been formed by the complete assimilation of ijolitic material in a natrocarbonatite magma at depth in the volcano conduit.

In the pseudo-quaternary tetrahedron calcite-magnesite-brucite-diopside, two of the significant reactions found are: (1) a eutectic at 650 °C, calcite + dolomite + periclase + forsterite + vapor = liquid, and (2) a peritectic at 1038 °C which is either calcite + åkermanite + forsterite + vapor = <b>monticellite</b> + liquid calcite + <b>monticellite</b> + forsterite + vapor = åkermanite + liquid. The eutectic liquid has high MgO/CaO and CO_ 2 /H_ 2 O and only 2 – 3 % SiO_ 2 (estimated 15 – 20 % MgCO_ 3, 35 – 40 % CaCO_ 3, 40 – 45 % Mg(OH) _ 2, and 5 – 6 % Mg_ 2 SiO_ 4). The composition joins intersect a thermal maximum for åkermanite + forsterite + vapor = liquid, which separates high-temperature liquids precipitating silicates together with a little calcite, from low-temperature liquids precipitating carbonates with a few percent of forsterite; {{there is no direct}} path between the silicate and synthetic carbonatite liquids on these joins, but it is possible that fractionating liquid paths diverging from the joins may connect them. More complex relationships involving the precipitation of <b>monticellite</b> and åkermanite are also outlined. Magnetite-magnesioferrite may replace periclase in natural magmatic systems. The results indicate that the assemblage calcite-dolomite-magnetite-forsterite represents the closing stages of crystallization of carbonatites, whereas assemblages such as calcite-magnetite-forsterite and dolomite-magnetite-forsterite span the whole range of carbonatite evolution in terms of temperature and composition, and provide the link between liquids precipitating silicates and those precipitating carbonates...|$|E

Spinel ({Delta}{sup 17 }O = - 25 {per_thousand} to - 20 {per_thousand}), massive and lacy Al,Ti-diopside ({Delta}{sup 17 }O = - 20 {per_thousand} to - 5 {per_thousand}) and fine-grained anorthite ({Delta}{sup 17 }O = - 15 {per_thousand} to - 2 {per_thousand}) in 100, 160 and 6 - 1 - 72 are {sup 16 }O-enriched relative spinel and coarse-grained Al,Ti-diopside and anorthite in ABC, 93 and TS 26 ({Delta}{sup 17 }O ranges from - 20 {per_thousand} to - 15 {per_thousand}, from - 15 {per_thousand} to - 5 {per_thousand}, and from - 5 {per_thousand} to 0 {per_thousand}, respectively). In 6 - 1 - 72, massive and lacy Al,Ti-diopside grains are {sup 16 }O-depleted ({Delta}{sup 17 }O {approx} - 13 {per_thousand}) relative to spinel ({Delta}{sup 17 }O = - 23 {per_thousand}). Melilite is the most {sup 16 }O-depleted mineral in all Allende Type C CAIs. In CAI 100, melilite and secondary grossular, <b>monticellite</b> and forsterite (minerals replacing melilite) are similarly {sup 16 }O-depleted, whereas grossular in CAI 160 is {sup 16 }O-enriched ({Delta}{sup 17 }O = - 10 {per_thousand} to - 6 {per_thousand}) relative to melilite ({Delta}{sup 17 }O = - 5 {per_thousand} to - 3 {per_thousand}). We infer that CAIs 100, 160 and CG 5 experienced melting in an {sup 16 }O-rich ({Delta}{sup 17 }O < - 20 {per_thousand}) nebular gas in the CAI-forming region. The Type C and Type-B-like portions of CAI 6 - 1 - 72 experienced melting in an {sup 16 }O-depleted ({Delta}{sup 17 }O {ge} - 13 {per_thousand}) nebular gas. CAIs ABC, TS 26 and 93 experienced isotopic exchange during re-melting {{in the presence of}} an {sup 16 }O-poor ({Delta}{sup 17 }O {ge} - 10 {per_thousand}) nebular gas in the chondrule-forming region(s). Subsequently, Allende Type C CAIs experienced post-crystallization isotopic exchange with an {sup 16 }O-poor reservoir that affected largely melilite and anorthite. Because pseudomorphic replacement of lacy melilite by grossular, <b>monticellite</b> and forsterite occurred during thermal metamorphism, some oxygen isotopic exchange of melilite and anorthite must have continued after formation of these secondary minerals. We suggest that some or all oxygen isotopic exchange in melilite and anorthite occurred during fluid-assisted thermal metamorphism on the CV parent asteroid. Similar processes may have also affected melilite and anorthite of CAIs in metamorphosed CO chondrites...|$|E
40|$|Mg and Fe K-edge x-ray {{absorption}} near-edge spectroscopy {{spectra of}} the Pbnm olivine series end mem- bers forsterite, fayalite, <b>monticellite,</b> and kirschsteinite, {{as well as}} of a synthetic Fe-Mg olivine of intermediate composition Fo 50, have been recorded and compared with multiple-scattering simulations. A comparison of experimental and theoretical spectra shows that all transition features, energy positions, and relative intensities can be reproduced in the energy range up to 60 eV above threshold when using clusters containing at least 80 atoms and extending over a sphere at least 0. 6 nm in radius away from the absorber. Mg and Fe are entirely in the expected structural sites in the four investigated end members. None of the models of Mg and Fe ordering in the octahedral site for the Fe 50 olivine compound proposed so far is verified; thus Fe-Mg ordering still remains an open problem for olivines of intermediate compositions...|$|E
40|$|In the {{recommendations}} of the Subcommission on the Systematics of Igneous Rocks of the International Union of Geological Sciences, in the volume edited by R. W. Le Maitre (2002), an evident contradiction in the definition of the dioritic and syenitic plutonic rocks is reported. According to Le Maitre (2002) the parameters used for the modal classification of the plutonic rocks are: Q, A, P, F and M, where Q = quartz, tridymite, cristobalite; A = alkali feldspar, including orthoclase, microcline, perthite, anorthoclase, sanidine and albitic plagioclase (An 0 to An 5); P = plagioclase (An 5 to An 100) and scapolite; F = feldspathoids including nepheline, leucite, kalsilite, analcime, sodalite, nosean, haûyne, cancrinite and pseudoleucite; M = mafic and related minerals, e. g. mica, amphibole, pyroxene olivine, opaque minerals, accessory minerals (e. g. zircon, apatite, titanite), epidote, allanite, garnet, melilite, <b>monticellite,</b> primary carbonate.
