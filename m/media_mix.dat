2500|$|Mekas {{presented}} another multimedia event by USCO {{the following}} month, {{for a week}} in January 1966. Titled Hubbub, the event was promoted in the Village Voice in an ad that described it as [...] "Expanded Cinema! Psychedelic Cinema! <b>Media</b> <b>Mix!</b> Marshall McLuhan! Timothy Leary! Film, oscilloscopes, stroboscopes, computerized, kinetic and live images. A visual feast." [...] Mekas, in his Village Voice column of spring 1966, interviewed Steve Durkee about USCO's use of strobe lights. Mekas asked, [...] "What is the strobe light all about?," [...] and Durkee replied, [...] "Strobe is the digital trip." [...] USCO's strobe environments, which relied on electronic modulation of fluorescent tubes, invoked the more complex emerging technology of the digital computer. Mekas also wrote about USCO in a 1966 review of their Riverside Museum show, comparing their work to the Exploding Plastic Inevitable and stating USCO went after the mystical experience in a more conscious way.|$|E

Sand, zeolite, sandy loam, and quartz-sand were separately mixed with lignin to form four bioretention <b>media</b> <b>mixes</b> for experimental study using synthetic stormwater runoff. The average removal efficiencies of four heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) {{by the four}} <b>media</b> <b>mixes</b> were all better than 97 % at the optimum pH of 6. 05 (ranging from 6 to 8) and the seven-day rainfall-event interval. The influence of the influent concentration and the rainfall-event interval on the removal efficiency of heavy metals by the four <b>media</b> <b>mixes</b> was not significant, but the variation of the removal efficiencies at the four-day rainfall-event interval was large. Under acidic conditions, {{there was a certain}} heavy metal dissolution in the four reactors, but the effect on the removal efficiency was minor. Heavy metals were present in the media mainly {{in the form of the}} residual fraction (> 50 %). The accumulation of Cu, Zn, and Cd in the surface planting-soil layer (same humus and sandy-loam mixture for all reactors) was significantly larger than the accumulation at deeper depths but not for Pb. Overall, the heavy metal removal efficiencies by the four <b>media</b> <b>mixes</b> were not significantly different, and the choice of the planting-soil layer can become the control factor of heavy metal removal...|$|R

The cell is portable, economic, lightweight and compact, consumes less fuel, {{and can be}} easily regenerated. Whatman filter papers served as porous supports for fluids.

40|$|Previous research, such as Sachse et al’s, adopted {{traditional}} sketching in the CAD modelling {{process and}} this method improved the design quality. However, {{there has been}} little investigated from a cognitive perspective of using <b>mixed</b> <b>media.</b> <b>Mixed</b> <b>media</b> design environments consist of conventional and digital tools, which are often superior to an individual tool during the conceptual design phase. When designers switch media from sketching to CAD modelling, the action of shifting is believed to improve design creativity. In studies of <b>mixed</b> <b>media,</b> designers were asked to use sketching first followed by CAD modelling. This method of using <b>mixed</b> <b>media</b> involving one shift in media is called sequential <b>mixed</b> <b>media</b> (SMM). However, there is an alternative method of using <b>mixed</b> <b>media,</b> known as alternate <b>mixed</b> <b>media</b> (AMM), in which designers alternate freely between sketching and CAD modelling. There has been limited studies in exploring designers’ behaviours in AMM, their shifting actions between tools and the triggering factors initiating the shifting actions. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis {{of a wide variety of}} design tools supporting conceptual design in the early design process. The paper also presents a methodology for a future study to investigate design cognition in <b>mixed</b> <b>media</b> design environments. The outcomes of the proposed research will lead to a more critical understanding of the way of using both design tools so that they can be utilised more effectively. The proposed research will particularly answer why and when designers shift from one tool to another tool during the conceptual design phase...|$|R
