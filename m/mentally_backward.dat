50|$|The Purple BEMs (紫のベムたち): A school boy {{constantly}} {{spends his}} time protecting his <b>mentally</b> <b>backward</b> younger brother from being bullied by neighborhood children. The only way he's found {{to keep his}} little brother amused is to tell him various children's stories. One night, the younger brother is late in returning home, and the hero discovers the boy out in the hills, having been abducted by bug-eyed monsters from space. The BEMs use a brain enhancing helmet to make the boy smarter and turning him into their spy, but all the boy can do is retell his older brother's stories. The hero returns home and starts crafting his tales so that they'll scare the BEMs off the planet.|$|E
40|$|Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) {{deficiency}} {{was first}} demonstrated in 1964 in an eight-year-old mentally retarded girl with bilaterally dislocated optic lenses who excreted abnormally elevated amounts of homocystine in her urine. Patients with similar metabolic abnormalities and clinical findings had first been discovered 2 years earlier by Carson {{and her colleagues}} during a survey of <b>mentally</b> <b>backward</b> children in Northern Ireland. CBS deficiency {{has proven to be}} the most frequently encountered of the human genetic diseases causing homocystinuria and severe hyperhomocyst(e) inemia. Worldwide, it is detected with a frequency of about 1 : 344, 000 by screening programs of the newborn, but this is undoubtedly an underestimate because some individuals are being missed. This chapter will briefly focus on the major clinical manifestations and metabolic aspects of CBS deficiency...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{three possible}} reasons why humans might accord a privileged status to emotional information when <b>mentally</b> traveling <b>backward</b> or forward in time. First, mental simulation of emotional situations helps {{one to make}} adaptive decisions. Second, it can serve an emotion regulation function. Third, it helps people to construct and maintain a positive view of the sel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It {{has been}} {{proposed}} by some that only humans {{have the ability to}} mentally travel back in time (i. e., have episodic memory) and forward in time (i. e., have the ability to simulate the future). However, there is evidence from a variety of nonhuman animals (e. g., primates, dolphins, scrub jays, rats, and pigeons) that they have some ability to recover personal memories of what-where-when an event occurred (an earlier requirement of the ability to recover an episodic memory) and answer unexpected questions (another requirement to distinguish between semantic and episodic memory). Also, perhaps more critically, according to Tulving’s more recent definition of mental time-travel, several animals (primates and scrub jays) {{have been shown to be}} able to pass the spoon test. That is, they are able to plan for the future. Thus, although humans show an advanced ability to <b>mentally</b> travel <b>backward</b> and forward in time, there is growing evidence that nonhuman animals have some of this capacity as well...|$|R
5000|$|The {{appearance}} of the first volume provoked a lively polemical correspondence {{in the pages of}} The Australian, with its [...] "agenda-setting capacity". It was positively reviewed by Geoffrey Blainey, who called it [...] "one of the most important and devastating (books) written on Australian history in recent decades", although Blainey notes that not every side-argument in the book convinced him and that his [...] "view is that the original Tasmanians were not as <b>backward,</b> <b>mentally</b> and culturally, as Windschuttle sometimes depicts them". On Windschuttle's analysis of the [...] "fabrications", Blainey wrote: [...] "While reading the long recital of these failings, I felt an initial sympathy towards the Australian and overseas historians who were under such intense scrutiny. But many of their errors, made on crucial matters, beggared belief. Moreover their exaggeration, gullibility, and what this book calls [...] "fabrication" [...] went on and on. Admittedly, if sometimes the historians' errors had chanced to favor the Aborigines, and sometimes they had happened to favor British settlers, a reader might sympathetically conclude that there was no bias amongst the historians but simply an infectious dose of inaccuracy. Most of the inaccuracies, however, are used to bolster the case for the deliberate destruction of the Aborigines." [...] Claudio Veliz greeted it as [...] "one of the most important books of our time". Peter Coleman, while speaking of its [...] "painstaking and devastating scholarship", regretted the absence from Windschuttle's work of any [...] "sense of tragedy".|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Beginning from an {{analysis}} of the green building evaluation and labeling projects reviewed, this paper has a comprehensive analysis on the low content of green design and obvious “absence ” of architects in the majority of evaluation and labeling projects by use of the theories of green architecture and economics. The author holds that such “absence ” is originated from the external economy and technical complexity of green buildings and attributes the causes to two aspects: First, there is no sound and effective incentive mechanism in the environment in which the architects are, especially the lack of professional identity and motivation of green design in architectural design appraisal, award and review criteria; Second, architects are less self-motivated, <b>mentally</b> <b>backward</b> and poor in comprehensive quality. Targeted measures are expected to advance the concept changes in the architectural education community, promote architects to transform thinking and enhance capacity and boost the “green ” development of green buildings...|$|E
40|$|Special Education is {{presently}} famous as inclusive Education. This Education system helps {{to develop the}} talents of differently abled children who have special needs. In this regard, it is usual that all children have shortcomings. It is the bounden duty of parents {{as well as those}} who are in educational factors to provide the Education wiping off the shortcomings. It cannot sideline the children with shortcomings, but it can be providing special education to them. The children who are unable to learn through normal class actives or who have hindrances in this are considered to have special needs. These children are found to be vastly different in physical, mental and emotional characteristics from normal children. They have special classes or Special schools in western countries. But in our country they are put in normal classes. Since they have different behavioral attitudes, they cannot be engaged in teaching activities like normal children, because they are <b>mentally</b> and physically <b>backward.</b> It is noteworthy that, important global attention is being paid to their special education. The differently abled children are being provided education while teachers are trained to teach them while environmental and health facilities with development and health facilities with development projects for them are provided Likewise, even in Sri Lanka importance is given, while government organizations and NHOs are rendering financial assistance to this effect. This research is done in order to find and express what type of teaching and maintaining methods do the Special Educational Institutions in the Manmunai North Divisional Secretariat Division, follow for the Special Needs student...|$|R
