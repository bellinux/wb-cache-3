40|$|Abstract Introduction Sustained {{cooperative}} {{action is}} required to improve the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> of populations, particularly in low and middle-income countries where meagre <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> investment and insufficient human and other resources result in poorly performing <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems.</b> The Observatory The International Observatory on <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Systems</b> is a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> research, education and development network that {{will contribute to the}} development of high quality <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> in low and middle-income countries. The work of the Observatory will be done by <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> research, education and development groups that are located in and managed by collaborating organisations. These groups will be supported by the IOMHS Secretariat, the International IOMHS Steering Group and a Technical Reference Group. Summary The International Observatory on <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Systems</b> is: 1) the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> research, education and development groups; 2) the IOMHS Steering Group; 3) the IOMHS Technical Reference Group; and 4) the IOMHS Secretariat. The work of the Observatory will depend on free and open collaboration, sharing of knowledge and skills, and governance arrangements that are inclusive and that put the needs and interests of people with mental illness and their families at the centre of decision-making. We welcome contact from individuals and institutions that wish to contribute to achieving the goals of the Observatory. Now is the time to make it happen where it matters, by turning scientific knowledge into effective action for people's health. (J. W.

40|$|Abstract There {{is a large}} {{treatment}} gap for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care in low- {{and middle-income}} countries (LMICs), {{with the majority of}} people with mental, neurological, and substance use (MNS) disorders receiving no or inadequate care. <b>Health</b> <b>system</b> factors are known to {{play a crucial role in}} determining the coverage and effectiveness of health service interventions, but the study of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> in LMICs has been neglected. The ‘Emerging <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> in LMICs’ (Emerald) programme aims to improve outcomes of people with MNS disorders in six LMICs (Ethiopia, India, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, and Uganda) by generating evidence and capacity to enhance <b>health</b> <b>system</b> performance in delivering <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care. A mixed-methods approach is being applied to generate evidence on: adequate, fair, and sustainable resourcing for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> (<b>health</b> <b>system</b> inputs); integrated provision of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services (<b>health</b> <b>system</b> processes); and improved coverage and goal attainment in <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> (<b>health</b> <b>system</b> outputs). Emerald has a strong focus on capacity-building of researchers, policymakers, and planners, and on increasing service user and caregiver involvement to support <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> strengthening. Emerald also addresses stigma and discrimination as one of the key barriers for access to and successful delivery of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services...|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the shootings, Virginian governor Tim Kaine convened a panel consisting of various officials and experts to investigate and examine the response and handling of issues related to the shootings. The panel released its final report in August 2007, devoting more than 30 pages to detailing Cho's troubled history. In the report, the panel criticized the failure of the educators and mental health professionals who came into contact with Cho during his college years to notice his deteriorating condition and help him. The panel also criticized misinterpretations of privacy laws and gaps in Virginia's <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>system</b> and gun laws. In addition, the panel faulted Virginia Tech administrators in particular for failing to take immediate action after the first shootings. Nevertheless, the report did acknowledge that Cho was still primarily responsible for not seeking assistance and for his murderous rampage.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric {{conditions}} comprise 14 % of {{the global}} burden of disease and 30 % of all noncommunicable disease. Despite the existence of cost-effective interventions, including administration of psychotropic medicines, the number of persons who remain untreated {{is as high as}} 85 % in low- and middle-income countries (LAMICs). While access to psychotropic medicines varies substantially across countries, no studies to date have empirically investigated potential <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> factors underlying this issue. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study uses a cross-sectional sample of 63 LAMICs and country regions to identify key <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> components associated with access to psychotropic medicines. Data from countries that completed the World Health Organization Assessment Instrument for <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Systems</b> (WHO-AIMS) were included in multiple regression analyses to investigate the role of five major <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> domains in shaping medicine availability and affordability. These domains are: <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> legislation, human rights implementations, <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care financing, human resources, and the role of advocacy groups. Availability of psychotropic medicines was associated with features of all five <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> domains. Most notably, within the domain of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> legislation, a comprehensive national <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> plan was associated with 15 % greater availability; and in terms of advocacy groups, the participation of family-based organizations in the development of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> legislation was associated with 17 % greater availability. Only three measures were related with affordability of medicines to consumers: level of human resources, percentage of countries' health budget dedicated to <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> and availability of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care in prisons. Controlling for country development, as measured by the Human Development Index, <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> features were associated with medicine availability but not affordability. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that strengthening particular facets of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> might improve availability of psychotropic medicines and that overall country development is associated with affordability...|$|R

500|$|At {{his press}} conference in 2008, Semyon Gluzman said that the surplus in Ukraine of {{hospitals}} for inpatient treatment {{of the mentally ill}} was a relic of the totalitarian communist regime and that Ukraine did not have epidemic of schizophrenia but somehow Ukraine had about 90 large psychiatric hospitals including the Pavlov Hospital where beds in its children's unit alone were more than in the whole of Great Britain. In Ukraine, public opinion did not contribute to the protection of citizens against possible recurrence of political abuse of psychiatry. There were no demonstrations and rallies in support of the mental health law. But there was a public campaign against developing the civilized law and against liberalizing the provision of psychiatric care in the country. The campaign was initiated and conducted by relatives of psychiatric patients. They wrote to newspapers, yelled in busy places and around them, behaved in the unbridled way in ministerial offices and corridors. Once Gluzman saw through a trolleybus window a group of 20-30 people standing by a window of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine with red flags, portraits of Lenin and Stalin and the slogan coarsely written on the white cardboard: [...] "Get the Gluzman psychiatry off Ukraine!" [...] Activists of the dissident movement far from the nostalgia for the past also participated in the actions against changes in the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>system.</b> But in general, it should be remembered that all these protest actions have been activated by nomenklatura psychiatrists. The whole Ukrainian psychiatric system actually consists of the two units: hospital for treatment of acute psychiatric conditions and internat-hospice for helpless [...] "chronic patients" [...] unable to live on their own. And between hospital and internat-hospice is desert. That is why about 40 percent of patients in any Ukrainian psychiatric hospital are so-called social patients whose stay in the psychiatric hospital is not due to medical indications. A similar pattern is in internats. A significant part of their lifelong customers could have lived long enough in society despite their mental illnesses. They could have lived quite comfortably and safely for themselves and others in special dorms, nursing homes, [...] "halfway houses". Ukraine does not have anything like that.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> {{appear to}} be among the first {{casualties}} of an economic downturn. Growing global political and economic uncertainty in Europe and elsewhere may mean that the next major economic crisis is not far off. Objectives: This paper considers what <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> might do in future to more rapidly respond to the impacts of economic shocks, and reduce the risk and/or mitigate the impacts of poor <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> and deliberate self-harm. It concentrates on two areas of risk to <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> in times of economic shock, namely increasing job insecurity and changing employment conditions, as well as the impacts of unmanageable debt. Results: Addressing the psychological impacts of less job-security and of surviving a downsizing in the workplace may be just as important to <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> as unemployment in an economic crisis. There is also evidence that unmanageable debt is associated with poor <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> and risk of suicide and self-harm. Conclusions: <b>Mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> need to develop plans for a rapid response to economic shocks, with a strong focus on a public <b>health</b> approach to <b>mental</b> <b>health.</b> Engaging and collaborating {{with a wide range of}} stakeholders, as well as secure budgets, will be imperative to effectiv...|$|R

A term adopted by many users of psychiatric services is [...] "consumer." [...] This term was chosen to eliminate the [...] "patient" [...] label and restore the person to an active role as a user or consumer of services. Some individuals are relieved to find that they have a recognized condition that they can apply a name to and this has led to many people self-diagnosing.

2500|$|Dewey {{played a}} leading role in {{securing}} support and funding for the New York State Thruway, which was eventually named in his honor. Dewey also streamlined and consolidated many state agencies to make them more efficient. During the Second World War construction in New York was limited, which allowed Dewey to create a $623 million budget surplus, which he placed into his [...] "Postwar Reconstruction Fund." [...] The fund would eventually create 14,000 new beds in the state's <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>system,</b> provide public housing for 30,000 families, allow for the reforestation of 34 million trees, create a water pollution program, provide slum clearance, and pay for a [...] "model veterans' program." [...] His governorship was also [...] "friendlier by far than his [...] predecessors to the private sector", as Dewey created a state Department of Commerce to [...] "lure new businesses and tourists to the Empire State, ease the shift from wartime boom, and steer small businessmen, in particular, through the maze of federal regulation and restriction."

2500|$|In the United States, {{there are}} broad {{patterns}} of reform within {{the history of}} psychiatric care for persons with mental illness. These patterns are currently categorized into three major cycles of reform. The first recognized cycle was the emergence of moral treatment and asylums, the second consists of the mental hygiene movement and the psychopathic (state) hospital, and most recent cycle includes deinstitutionalization and community mental health. [...] In an article addressing the historical developments and reforms of treatment for the mentally ill, Joseph Morrissey and Howard Goldman acknowledge the current regression of public social welfare for mentally ill populations. They specifically state that the [...] "historical forces {{that led to the}} transinstitutionalization of the mentally ill from almshouses to the state mental hospitals in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have now been reversed in the aftermath of recent deinstitutionalization policies". Ultimately, Morrissey and Goldman argue that while each transition expanded the American <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>system</b> into today's [...] "pluralistic patchwork of public and private" [...] structural efforts, each failed to make lasting effects on the societally debilitating nature of chronic mental illness, including the linked effects of poverty and homelessness.|$|E
