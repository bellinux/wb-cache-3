25|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the receipt of}} the first order in November 1949, Hawker set about establishing a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>line</b> for the Sea Hawk at their Kingston facility. Shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War, an urgent operational demand for Britain's aircraft carriers, and thus their accompanying aircraft, had become apparent. The rate of production was substantially increased, and further orders for the Sea Hawk were soon placed. The issuing of a 'Super-Priority' status for the Sea Hawk by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1951, served to speed up production considerably as well as aid the supply of vital materials for its manufacture.|$|E
25|$|During early 1943, a {{production}} {{line for the}} Tempest V was established in Hawker's Langley facility, alongside the existing <b>manufacturing</b> <b>line</b> for the Hawker Hurricane. Production was initially slow, claimed {{to be due to}} issues encountered with the rear spar. On 21 June 1943, the first production Tempest V, JN729, rolled off the production line and its maiden flight was conducted by test pilot Bill Humble. Several early production aircraft were used for experimental purposes; a number of these underwent extensive service trials at Boscombe Down including clearances to be fitted with external stores, including 500lb (227kg) and 1,000lb (454kg) bombs and 3in (76.2mm) RP-3 rockets, although few Tempest Vs deployed such ordnance operationally during the War. On 8 April 1944, the Tempest V attained general clearance.|$|E
25|$|BP Solar begun {{constructing}} a new solar photovoltaic cell manufacturing plant at its European headquarters in Tres Cantos, Madrid. For phase {{one of the}} Madrid expansion, BP Solar aimed to expand its annual cell capacity from 55 MW to around 300 MW. Construction of this facility was underway, with the first <b>manufacturing</b> <b>line</b> expected to be fully operational in 2009. The new cell lines would use innovative screen-printing technology. By fully automating wafer handling, the manufacturing lines {{would be able to}} handle the very thinnest of wafers available and ensure the highest quality. Thin wafers are of particular importance since there has been a silicon shortage in recent years. However, after the new national law limiting installed power by year, in April 2009 BP Solar closed its factories.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examines two <b>manufacturing</b> <b>lines</b> producing semiconductors {{using different}} technology concepts, namely Conventional-Line(CL) and Lean-Production-Line (LPL). The two production <b>lines</b> that are <b>manufacturing</b> the same products {{located in the}} Free Zone Trade Malacca, Malaysia were compared using various factors, including working conditions (WC), tasks risks and dangers (RD) of the job, and physical body stress (BS). Numerous studies on ergonomics in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>lines</b> have been conducted. However, ergonomics investigation in high-technology semiconductor <b>manufacturing</b> <b>lines</b> comparing two different technologies is not evident. Moreover, no study has investigated the ergonomics-productivity influences in semiconductor <b>manufacturing</b> <b>lines.</b> With this in mind, {{the aim of the}} present study is "To investigate working environments in two different semiconductor <b>manufacturing</b> <b>lines</b> in order to enhance the workers' satisfaction". The study focused on working conditions (i. e temperature, lighting, noise, tidiness, layout, spaciousness and ventilation), job risk and dangers (i. e. perform risky job, health and personal protective equipment) and physical body stress (i. e. eyestrain, headaches, tension on back and neck, sensory irritation, strain in wrist and comfortable uniform wears) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of automation systems, including control system for tools machines {{can be done}} in three ways: - logical wired - logic programming - and mixed, both of them, wired and logical programming Nowadays, we still use in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>lines</b> log ical wired, automation made by using relays and contactors. In this way the reliability is very low and leads to a high rate of defects and therefore breaks the functionality of the entire manufacturing process, sometimes with significant losses in product ions.

2500|$|Athlon XP-Ms {{were popular}} with desktop overclockers, {{as well as}} underclockers.

Also, {{the fact that they were}} not locked to a single multiplier was a significant simplification in the overclocking process. Some Barton core Athlon XP-Ms have been successfully overclocked as high as 3.1GHz.|$|E
