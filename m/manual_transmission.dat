5|$|Ford {{released}} the Mk II (BA II) Falcon in October 2004 to maintain sales interest until the 2005 {{introduction of the}} BF update. Modifications included some cosmetic changes and a new six-speed Tremec T56 <b>manual</b> <b>transmission</b> replacing the five-speed on XR6 Turbo and XR8 models.|$|E
5|$|Building on the {{features}} of the XT, Ford Australia at one point considered not releasing the sports-oriented Falcon XR6 because of the new XR6 Turbo model. However, Ford overturned this decision before production. A specifically designed body kit distinguished the XR6 from other variants, except for the XR6 Turbo and XR8 which shared the sports bodywork. The naturally aspirated engine was identical to the engine used on the XT and Futura, and the five-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transmission</b> came as standard.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical {{specifications}} carried over, {{except for}} a new five-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transmission,</b> optional on the 1.9-litre four-cylinder and 2.85-litre six-cylinder versions. In an attempt to improve sales figures of the inline-four engine, Holden spent considerable time improving its performance and efficiency. Modifications were also made to the 2.85-litre six to lift economy, and the powerplants managed {{to reduce fuel consumption}} by as much as 12.5 and 14percent, correspondingly. Holden released the sports-oriented Commodore SS sedan in September 1982—reintroducing a nameplate used briefly ten years prior with the HQ series. Provisioned with a choice of 4.2- or optional 5.0-litre V8 engines, both versions of the VH SS were teamed with a four-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transmission.</b> Racing driver Peter Brock's Holden Dealer Team (HDT) high performance outfit produced three upgraded versions, known as Group One, Group Two and Group Three, the latter version available in either 4.2-litre or more commonly 5.0-litre V8 configuration.|$|E
50|$|The {{portfolio}} {{ranges from}} classical <b>manual</b> <b>transmissions,</b> automated <b>manual</b> <b>transmissions</b> and automatic transmissions based on dual clutch transmission (DCT) technology to various hybridization solutions, range extender systems and purely electric drivetrains.|$|R

5|$|The {{base engine}} was {{a version of}} the older Simca Type 180 2.0-litre with {{increased}} displacement, as also featured in the Matra Murena. It was unrelated to either the American Chrysler K or PSA Douvrin 2.2-litre engines. Available trim levels were designated GL and GLS. The GL was the only model to feature the four-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transmission,</b> and have power steering as an option as opposed to standard. It was first to be dropped, for the 1983 model year.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} underpinnings {{are based}} on the mainstream VE Commodore models of the same years. The car is powered by GM's 6.2-litre LS3 V8 engine, with a maximum power output of 442 PS (325kW). Buyers have the option of a six-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transmission</b> or six-speed automatic transmission; the manual is capable of reaching 0–100km/h (0–62mph) in 5.5 seconds and the automatic is capable of 0–100km/h (0–62mph) in 5.6 seconds.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, it was {{announced}} that exports of the Commodore would resume to North America {{in the form of the}} VF Commodore as the Chevrolet SS sedan for the 2014 model year. The Chevrolet SS Sedan was imported to the United States (but again, not to Canada) again for 2015 with only minor changes, notably the addition of Magnetic Ride Control suspension and a Tremec TR-6060 <b>manual</b> <b>transmission.</b> For the 2016 model year, the SS sedan received a facelift based on the VF Series II Commodore unveiled in September 2015.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the 1970s, manufacturers' <b>manual</b> <b>transmissions</b> {{generally}} {{had three}} or four gears. To meet requirements to maximize fuel economy, manufacturers began offering 5- and, in the 1990s, 6- speed <b>manual</b> <b>transmissions.</b> Likewise, 3-speed automatic transmissions were the norm until fairly recently, but now 6-, 7-, and 8-speed automatic transmissions are being offered.|$|R
5|$|Marketed largely {{towards the}} fleet industry, the {{entry-level}} Falcon XT {{sold in the}} most numbers. Featuring the base Barra 182 six-cylinder engine, air conditioning, front power windows, and five-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transmission,</b> with {{the choice of a}} four-speed automatic, the XT was sold in sedan and station wagon body types. The Barra 220 V8 engine was available as an option. Judges of the Australia's Best Cars awards crowned the XT Best Family Car in 2002, and again in 2004, with the Futura receiving the award in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{played a}} {{substantial}} {{role in the}} development of the VX model. Bosch 5.3 anti-lock brakes were made standard on all variants, a first for an Australian manufactured car; and traction control was made available on vehicles equipped with <b>manual</b> <b>transmission.</b> Extensive research was undertaken to reduce the effects from a side-impact collision through modification of the B-pillars. The risk presented by a side-impact collision in a VX fitted without side airbags is reduced by 50percent when compared to a similarly specified VT model.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} the original PlayStation era graphics of Rally 2.0 would not hold up to modern standards on a high pixel density mobile display. To improve the graphical quality they introduced modern shader-based rendering and overhauled the textures. The engine specifications for the vehicles were retained from the classic Rally games. Although the models for the vehicles were also preserved, developers increased their resolution and added more detail and graphical layers to the car bodies. Other features that were carried over include the chassis deformation effects and realistic buildup of dirt on the vehicles. PhysX-based collision detection was implemented to enable more objects and debris to scatter. Changes were also made to lighting, audio, controls, and user interface. The team decided to omit a number of Rally 2.0 features, such as multiplayer, <b>manual</b> <b>transmission,</b> variable gear ratios, weather reports, and the cockpit camera view. Game producer Pete Harrison cited creating a polished, core rallying experience for mobile as {{the focal point of}} the project and felt that some features would not be suitable for the short play sessions that they expected from a portable racing game.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system remains}} unchanged from Ridge Racer, the checkpoint and time limit system remain the same; {{running out of}} time ends the race and passing through checkpoints grants additional time, although the car drifting is more like Ridge Racer 2. The player drives using automatic transmission or <b>manual</b> <b>transmission.</b> Ridge Racer Revolution supports Namco's NeGcon controller, and adds a rear-view mirror when using the in-car view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened, and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. Ridge Racer Revolution adds a mode: Free Run, in which there are no other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which speed grade is used, selectable in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available {{at the start of the}} game. Ridge Racer Revolution features a two-player link-up mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racers courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'. There are two modes in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car.|$|E
25|$|All models (including 2015 Nismo) include 7-speed {{automatic}} with paddle shifters or 6-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transmission.</b> SynchroRev Match {{system for}} 6-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transmission</b> is {{included with the}} Sport Package.|$|E
25|$|The {{naturally}} aspirated came as standard {{issue with the}} W58 <b>manual</b> <b>transmission.</b> The turbo versions included the more robust R154 <b>manual</b> <b>transmission.</b> Both were available with the optional 4-speed A340E automatic transmission.|$|E

25|$|The base L only {{offers a}} {{six-speed}} <b>manual</b> <b>transmission,</b> while the Premier, {{on the other}} end of the spectrum, offers only a six-speed automatic transmission. The LS and LT trim levels offer either a six-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transmission,</b> or a six-speed automatic transmission.|$|E
25|$|The same {{assortment}} of 401-cubic-inch V8s was carried over from 1962 but the three-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transmission</b> returned as standard equipment with the two-speed Turbine Drive automatic reverted to the option list. A new and rarely ordered option {{this year was}} a floor-mounted four-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E
25|$|Motor car {{licences}} {{issued in}} the United Kingdom distinguish between automatic and <b>manual</b> <b>transmission</b> vehicles, {{depending on whether}} or not a driving test was passed in a vehicle with <b>manual</b> <b>transmission</b> (unless a vehicle test was taken in the UK before such distinction was made). While a <b>manual</b> <b>transmission</b> vehicle licence permits the holder to drive a vehicle of either kind, an automatic transmission vehicle licence is solely for vehicles with automatic transmission. The licence also shows whether a driver requires glasses or contact lenses to meet the legal driving requirements, if known.|$|E

At first, five speed Eaton Fuller transmissions were equipped in all 96A3 and 102A3 coaches. Beginning with the 1989 model year 102C3SS coaches, Greyhound Canada specified seven speed <b>manual</b> <b>transmissions.</b>|$|R

25|$|For 1998 the R was {{available}} in 6 colours: Black Stone, Nautic Blue, Silver Metallic, Coral Red, Regency Red, Saffron. All apart from the first one were metallic paints with Saffron only being available for the V70 R. Versions offered included FWD & AWD, both with either a 4-speed automatic or 5-speed <b>manual</b> <b>transmission.</b> Cars with the automatic transmission were rated at 240PS, while <b>manual</b> <b>transmission</b> cars featured a bigger turbo bumping up power by 10PS to 250PS and torque to 350NM. FWD <b>manual</b> <b>transmission</b> equipped R featured a viscous based limited-slip differential. In the US neither FWD nor manual transmissions were offered.|$|E
