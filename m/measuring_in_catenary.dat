40|$|A partial {{damage caused}} by an {{abnormal}} load could trigger progressive collapse of high rise buildings which may lead to terrible casualties. However, {{in the process of}} column failure, "catenary action" {{plays an important role in}} redistributing the internal load and preventing progressive collapses of the structure. Rigid composite joints, thanks to their high strength and good ductility, exert great influence <b>in</b> <b>catenary</b> action. Therefore, an experiment related to a 1 / 3 scale progressive collapse resistance with the use of rigid composite joints was conducted, and the results of the experiment were analyzed. Based on the experiment results, a FE model was developed and analyzed. This paper describes the experiment, the results analyzed, and the FE model in detail. The experiment showed that the progressive collapse mechanism of composite frame consisted of 6 stages: elastic stage, elastic-plastic stage, arch stage, plastic stage, transient stage and <b>catenary</b> stage. <b>In</b> <b>catenary</b> stage, catenary action evidently enhanced the resistance to the progressive collapse of the frames. The steel-concrete composite frame with rigid connections designed in accordance to current design standards showed a good resistance to progressive collapse.

This is undesirable once {{it is possible that the}} loop turns into a kink, creating damage. This work presents a numerical methodology to analyze the conditions of loop formation <b>in</b> <b>catenary</b> risers. Stability criteria were applied to finite element models, including geometric nonlinearities and contact constraint due to riser-seabed interaction. The classical Greenhill's formula was used to predict the phenomenon and parametric analysis shows a “universal plot” able to predict instability <b>in</b> <b>catenaries</b> using a simple equation that can be applied for typical risers installation conditions and, generically, for catenary lines under torsion.

40|$|A {{full scale}} test {{embankment}} was constructed {{to evaluate the}} performance {{of different types of}} load transfer platforms (LTP) supported on geopiers. LTP is defined as a region from the base in the embankment that behaves like a platform where partial or full embankment load is transferred to the columns. Three types of LTP were constructed, they include reinforced concrete LTP, geosynthetic-reinforced LTP with two layers of geogrid (catenary LTP), and geosynthetic-reinforced LTP with three or more layers of geogrid (beam LTP). Because very few studies on LTPs supported on less stiff columns such as geopiers are available, this full-scale embankment experiment aspires to shed more light on the suitability of using such columns together with geosynthetic-reinforced LTP to support embankments on soft soils. The results indicate that the differential settlement between the geopier and the matrix soil is smaller in the reinforced concrete and beam LTP than <b>in</b> <b>catenary</b> LTP. Although the differential settlement in the beam LTP is small, tension in the geogrid can be as high as 27 % of the allowable design strain (5 %). <b>In</b> the <b>catenary</b> LTP, the strain in the geogrid was approximately 10 % of the allowable design strain (6 %).

40|$|Traditionally {{materials}} used for catenary support structures are steel, concrete or even wood, {{in combination with}} the use of insulators. The development of new materials such as Fibre Reinforced Plastics (FRP) makes a new revolutionary design possible. The use of FRP is expanding rapidly at the moment, being applied already in bridges, lock-doors and the design of High-Voltage towers [1]. A benefit of FRP from a mechanical point of view is that, due to the reduced Young modulus, the design is mainly determined by the stiffness of the construction, therefore the resulting strength of the structure is very high. The insulating properties of the material make it possible to omit the use of insulators. This leads to the following benefits <b>in</b> <b>catenary</b> design: - Environmental friendly as no zinc or paint is required for conservation; - FRP is easy to be recycled; - Cost reduction as no insulators are required; - Reduced height of civil structures as no space is required for insulators; - Reduced maintenance costs, since FRP does not corrode; - Reduced weight of catenary support structure simplifying foundation design; - For d. c. systems no voltage limiting devices are needed, therefore reducing stray currents and reducing impact of the railway on other structures such as pipelines (provided that the construction meets the requirements for reinforced insulation in accordance with [5]; - Number of construction parts is reduced, leading to easier and faster construction. As the mechanical properties of FRP are well known at present, the main interest concerns the electrical properties, especially in relation to ageing and pollution. Therefore, conductivity measurements have been performed on a FRP beam which has been in use in the railway environment for 20 years. Also measurements have been conducted on a reference sample in a High- Voltage laboratory. Three situations have been studied: - Original state; - Cleaned; - After salt-spray test. Based on the measurements it can be concluded that the conductivity, even after being in use for 20 years, is sufficient for the intended use. Conductivity can be attributed mainly {{to the surface of the}} material, and is probably due to the deposition of carbon and metal particles from pantograph, catenary and moisture. It can be concluded that the use of FRP <b>in</b> <b>catenary</b> support structures, without insulators is a promising new technology, with benefits for both costs as well as the environment...|$|R
