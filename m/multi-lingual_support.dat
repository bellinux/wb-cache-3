The size of transcribed data is about 1 million words, and the corpus would deserve to be called the simultaneous in-terpretation corpus of the largest-in-the-world class. The dis-course tag and the utterance time tag were given to the corpus, and some software tools for corpus analysis in order to support the practical use of the corpus have been developed. Therefore, the corpus is expected to be useful not only for the development of simultaneous interpreting systems but also for the construc-tion of an interpreting theory. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{linguistic}} approach {{to the analysis of}} proper names. The basic assumption of our approach is that proper names are linguistic units of text that should be treated using the same methods that are applied to text in its totality. We illustrate the inflectional and derivational properties of simple and multi-word proper names on the example of Serbian, and describe how these properties have been formalized in order to develop e-dictionaries of the DELA type. In order to <b>support</b> <b>multi-lingual</b> applications we have developed a model of a multilingual relational dictionary of proper names based on an ontology, as well as an actual database. Finally, we outline how the developed dictionaries and database can be used in real monolingual and multi-lingual applications, such as information extraction...|$|R

This supports the component oriented development of interactive systems, {{in such a}} way, that interactive components can be represented either as players that make moves {{according to the rules}} of a game or as umpires that enforce the rules on players, and thereby controlling their interactions. The architecture has already been successfully applied to develop knowledge-based front-ends to software packages, including <b>multi-lingual</b> <b>support</b> for such applications. The potential of the architecture is that centralized organizations controlled by umpires or decentralized organizations in terms of autonomous players can be combined to form interactive systems of a very complex nature...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} the high value to researchers in many disciplines of having web-based graphical editors for scientific workflows and {{draws attention to}} two technological transitions: good quality editors can now run in a browser and workflow enactment systems are emerging that manage multiple workflow languages and <b>support</b> <b>multi-lingual</b> workflows. We contend that this provides {{a unique opportunity to}} introduce multi-lingual graphical workflow editors which in turn would yield substantial benefits: workflow users would find it easier to share and combine methods encoded in multiple workflow languages, the common framework would stimulate conceptual convergence and increased workflow component sharing, and the many workflow communities could share a substantial part of the effort of delivering good quality graphical workflow editors in browsers. The paper examines whether such a common framework is feasible and presents an initial design for a web-based editor, tested with a preliminary prototype. It is not a fait accompli but rather an urgent rallying cry to explore collaboratively a generic web-based framework before investing in many divergent individual implementations...|$|R
40|$|Despite the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) 2005 recommendation, few care {{organizations}} have instituted standard survivorship care plans (SCPs). Low health literacy and low English proficiency are important factors {{to consider in}} SCP development. Our study aimed to identify information needs and survivorship care plan preferences of low literacy, <b>multi-lingual</b> patients to <b>support</b> the transition from oncology to primary care and ongoing learning in survivorship. We conducted focus groups in five languages with African American, Latina, Russian, Filipina, White, and Chinese medically underserved breast cancer patients. Topics explored included the transition to primary care, access to information, knowledge of treatment history, and perspectives on SCPs. Analysis of focus group data identified three themes: 1) the need for information and education on the transition between "active treatment" and "survivorship"; 2) information needed (and often not obtained) from providers; and 3) perspectives on SCP content and delivery. Our data point {{to the need to}} develop a process as well as written information for medically underserved breast cancer patients. An SCP document will not replace direct communication with providers about treatment, symptom management and transition, a communication that is missing in participating safety-net patients' experiences of cancer care. Women turned to peer support and community-based organizations in the absence of information from providers. "Clear and effective" communication of survivorship care for safety-net patients requires dedicated staff trained to address wide-ranging information needs and uncertainties...|$|R
40|$|The Masters of STEM project {{seeks to}} excite young {{people about the}} {{positive}} impact of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) research and innovation, both throughout history and in the current day, and to introduce and reinforce positive role models from the STEM community. The purpose is to promote broader knowledge of STEM and the impact it has had on society, and to encourage more young people to undertake higher education and follow careers in STEM. The project already has partners in Europe, USA and Brazil, and continues to grow the partnership and funding base. At {{the core of the}} project is the development and deployment of an online game platform, supporting users playing short game scenarios developed by the project, and allowing them to develop their own scenarios utilising characters developed by the project to represent the role models we identify, the Masters of STEM. The game platform will <b>support</b> <b>multi-lingual</b> versioning, and role models will be identified and characterised for the scenarios at both global and local level. Rules and constraints will be applied at character level to ensure the scenarios developed by users are within acceptable limits of behaviour and activity. A number of types of scenarios will be developed, offering interest and engagement for users of all ages, from infant to adult, and this will permit the development of a user community generating their own content for the platform. The project will disseminate these outcomes widely throughout the world, particularly through the schools networks. To achieve this, websites will be developed by the project partners providing localised information on STEM activities, careers and opportunities in different regions. This will permit the development of region-specific linguistic and cultural representation of information, and identification of role models, both real and media-generated. Information on these role models will feed through to the game platform, which will be linked to these websites to provide both general and region-specific scenarios. The project partners will also use online surveys to capture information on young peoples attitudes towards STEM, positive views on characters from the STEM community, and interest in games. Initial work on the games platform has already begun, based on the Unity games engine and existing work on the scenario-authoring tool from the Pandora+ platform. Contact has been established with a number of media groups to ascertain the potential to use media characters as STEM role models, e. g. Big Bang Theory & CSI characters, and, where possible, real individuals will be approached to give their permission for their images and stories {{to be used in the}} system. Historical characters should not require such permissions, but the project will ensure that all characters are treated with respect, and the system will not permit inappropriate scenarios to be generated. User evaluation of the system will be sought continuously through feedback surveys, frequency of use measures, and user ratings. Impact measures will be established by agreement with the wider community...|$|R

In this paper, we assess various methods for supporting an additional target language in lexicon-based {{sentiment analysis}}. As a baseline, we automatically translate text into a reference language for which a sentiment lexicon is available, and subsequently analyze the translated text. Second, we consider mapping sentiment scores from a semantically enabled sentiment lexicon in the reference language to a new target sentiment lexicon, by traversing relations between language-specific semantic lexicons. Last, we consider creating a target sentiment lexicon by propagating sentiment of seed words in a semantic lexicon for the target language. When extending sentiment analysis from English to Dutch, mapping sentiment across languages by exploiting relations between semantic lexicons yields a significant performance improvement over the baseline of about 29...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn India {{there are}} 744 Universities which offer Graduate Degrees, Post Graduate Degrees and other {{relevant}} courses. 50 % of the Universities are awarding PhDs {{based on the}} research conducted by scholars/academicians {{under the supervision of}} PhD guides who are generally Professors, Scientists etc. There was no attempt at national level in India to digitise or keep archives of PhD theses in one platform before this ETD initiative as two universities initiated the digitisation process of Theses at their respective universities. "Shodhganga" is the first initiative in India to provide a platform for research scholars to deposit their PhD theses and make it available to the entire scholarly community in open access mode. As such, Shodhganga set-up by the INFLIBNET Centre, an IUC of UGC, Min. of HRD, Govt. of India is standardised as a repository in the nation by hosting more than 83000 full text theses from more than 250 Universities. The word "Shodh" originates from Sanskrit and stands for research and discovery Ganga is a popular river with its root in Indian culture and civilization. Universities are encouraged to sign an MoU with INFLIBNET Centre for joining Shodhganga, subsequently, 270 +, universities came forward to sign the MoU and contribute to the repository. CFTIs (Centrally Funded Technical Institutes) like IITs, IIMs, NITs, etc. are also directed by Min of HRD to deposit their research output in order to make Shodhganga as a National portal of theses and Shodhgangotri with synopses. Signatory Universities which sign MoU on Shodhganga with INFLIBNET Centre usually get financial assistance from the UGC for digitization of back lists of theses, funds for setting-up of ETD Laboratory and getting access to plagiarism detection software. Shodhganga portal has unique features and functionalities such as (i) Open access repository of Indian theses for world wide access, (ii) Customized ingestion interface for ease of submission of theses using DSpace,(iii) Integration with Theses Database of IndCat (with 2. 66 Lacs bibliographic data), (iv) Visually linked browser;(v) <b>Multi-lingual</b> <b>support</b> for theses hosted in the repository. Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil, Sanskrit, Malayalam, Urdu, Marathi already enabled and many other features for easy navigation through the theses. There are different discovery tools to get relevant information and knowledge snippets from the research output in Shodhganga. These tools are categorised into two types viz-a-viz Search and Browse. Seaching enable the user to do simple search witha word or sentence, advance search with boolean operators, subject wise search basedon WoS subjects and LoC subjects, and Google API to find information from the theses' content.
