50|$|Lyman {{continuum}} photons (abbrev. LyC), shortened to Ly continuum photons or Lyc photon, are the photons {{emitted from}} stars at photon energies above the Lyman limit. Hydrogen is ionized by absorbing LyC. Working off of Victor Schumann's discovery of ultraviolet light, from 1906 to 1914, Theodore Lyman observed that atomic hydrogen absorbs light only at specific frequencies (or wavelengths) and the Lyman series is thus named after him. All the wavelengths in the Lyman series {{are in the}} ultraviolet band. This quantized absorption behavior occurs only up to an energy limit, known as the ionization energy. In the case of neutral atomic hydrogen, the <b>minimum</b> <b>ionization</b> energy {{is equal to the}} Lyman limit, where the photon has enough energy to completely ionize the atom, resulting in a free proton and a free electron. Above this energy (below this wavelength), all wavelengths of light may be absorbed. This forms a continuum in the energy spectrum; the spectrum is continuous rather than composed of many discrete lines, which are seen at lower energies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fully quantum {{treatment}} explicitly {{presents the}} high harmonic generation as a three-stage process: above threshold ionization (ATI) {{is followed by}} the continuum electron propagation in a laser field and subsequent stimulated recombination back into the initial state. The contributions of all ATI channels add up coherently. All three stages of the process are described by simple, mostly analytical expressions. A very good quantitative agreement with the previous calculations on the harmonic generation by H − ion is demonstrated, thus supplementing the conceptual significance of the theory with its practical efficiency. Under the influence of an intensive electromagnetic field an atom can emit electrons and photons. The number of photons absorbed from the field in the first process generally exceeds the <b>minimum</b> necessary for <b>ionization,</b> i. e. the photoelectrons are characterized by their distribution over above threshold ionization (ATI) channels.

So far, {{most of the}} heavy ion synchrotrons have been operated with high charge state heavy ions. In order to reach intensities of more than 10 11 /U-ions per cycle [1, 2], SIS 18 and SIS 100 must be operated with intermediate charge state ions [3, 4]. Such a high intensity operation with intermediate charge state heavy ions has never been demonstrated elsewhere. A major upgrade program is being conducted since ten years to prepare the desired booster operation of SIS 18. The specific problems coming along with the intermediate charge state operation are strong charge exchange processes by collisions with residual gas atoms, pressure bumps by ion induced desorption and corresponding self amplifying beam loss.

Except for He"*(2 " 1 S) +Xe, all systems show a pronounced <b>minimum</b> of <b>ionization</b> at thermal energies. In the hyperthermal range, however, the two spin systems behave totally different: the triplet systems exhibit a broad saturating maximum of ionization, whereas the singlet systems reveal a shallow shaped second minimum which can be rationalized within the one-electron model potential calculations of Siska (1979). For all systems, complex - only distance dependent - potentials of an effective single-channel Schroedinger equation can be found which model the measured features properly. The picture found deepens when differential elastic cross sections from experiments of other groups are included: the dynamics turn out to be spin dependent. In the triplet case, differential and chemiionization data can be adequately described with one complex potential, i. e. the local approximation holds. This is not valid for the singlet systems. The hyperthermal minima instead provide the necessary conclusion that the optical singlet potentials are nonlocal. According to a theoretical study of Morgner (1990), it immediately follows that the singlet entrance channel He"*(2 " 1 S) +Y is subject to a dynamic coupling to at least one other channel He"*"*+Y embedded in the ionization continuum. Such a coupling - most likely of Demkov-Nikitin type - was suggested long ago for He"*"*=He"*(2 " 1 P). The higher complexity in collisions with He"*(2 " 1 S) arises from (i) the smaller 2 P- 2 S splitting, (ii) the lack of the Fermi hole in the electron correlation, and (iii) the well known difficulty with the Brillouin theorem in SCF calculations.

Because cosmic-ray modulation in the interplanetary medium creates an inverse relationship between cosmic-ray intensity and solar activity, the ionization rate in the lower atmosphere will vary with the 11 -year solar cycle {{in such a way}} that maximum ionization will occur at sunspot minimum and <b>minimum</b> <b>ionization</b> at sunspot maximum. This variable ionization may, by the process of ion-induced nucleation, regulate the formation and optical properties of an upper tropospheric haze in the atmosphere of Neptune and could thus provide a mechanism for modulating the planet's visual brightness over a solar cycle. We estimate the rates of cosmic-ray ionization at solar maximum and minimum for a range of proposed Neptune dipole magnetic field strengths; discuss the physics of formation of ion clusters and eventual aerosol particles; and, using a simple radiative transfer model, discuss the ways in which this variable aerosol formation can modulate the geometric albedo of Neptune over a solar cycle.

Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions {{was used}} to irradiate a nuclear track emulsion by a beam of radioactive 8 He nuclei of energy of 60 MeV and enrichment of about 80 %. Measurements of 278 decays of 8 He nuclei stopped in the emulsion allow one to evaluate possibilities of α-spectrometry and to observe a thermal drift of 8 He. At the energy of nuclei of a few MeV per nucleon, {{there is a possibility}} of implantation of radioactive nuclei into a detector material. In this approach the daughter nuclei arising in their decays can be investigated. In particular, population of 2 α- and 3 α-particle states is possible in decays of light radioactive nuclei. In this respect, the known, although somewhat forgotten, possibilities of nuclear track emulsion (NTE) for the detection of slow radioactive nuclei are worthy to be mentioned. The advantages of this method are the best spatial resolution (about 0. 5 μm), the possibility of observing the tracks in a full solid angle and a record sensitivity starting with relativistic singly charged particles with a <b>minimum</b> <b>ionization.</b> In NTE, the directions and ranges of the beam nuclei, as well as slow products of their decays can be measured, which provides a basis for α-spectrometry.

The good resolution expected for their momentum measurement shall also make them powerful tools in event reconstruction. Muon identification will thus be a crucial issue in the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Their charged tracks can be reconstructed in the external spectrometer only, but the combination of such "stand-alone" tracks with tracks from the inner detector shall increase the precision and reliablilty of the reconstructed muon. This is particularly true in {{the lower part of the}} pT spectrum, where the inner detector is more performant. We will present here the various strategies for combined muon identification in the ATLAS experiment. The main algorithms, called Staco and Muid, perform the combination of existing tracks in the inner detector and in the muon spectrometer, allowing the best identification of muon tracks.

40|$|The {{experiments}} herein described {{support and}} extend the relationship found by Forbush, namely, {{that there is an}} inverse relationship between solar activity and cosmic-ray intensity. During the summer of 1954 the sun was at a <b>minimum</b> of activity. <b>Ionization</b> chambers set up in the Arctic as well as at intermediate latitudes showed a considerable increase in intensity, during the period, compared with 1951. Atmospheric absorption combined with magnetic rigidity requirements indicate that protons with energies down to at least 150 Mev were coming to the earth in the summer of 1954. We conclude that there was no cutoff of primary particles, i. e., no "knee," at least for protons down to this energy. Using the increased areas under the ionization-depth curves, combined with geomagnetic calculations, an estimate may be made of the numbers of primary particles coming in near the poles in 1937 (solar maximum), 1951 and 1954 (solar minimum). These values are 0. 10, 0. 14, and 0. 24 cm- 2 sec- 1 sterad- 1, respectively. The fluctuations in 1954 were also small compared with those measured in 1937, 1938, and 1951.

Here I examine the Balbus-Hawley (magnetorotational) instability of a weak, vertical magnetic field within a weakly-ionized disc. Vertical stratification is neglected, and a linear analysis is undertaken {{for the case}} that the wave vector of the perturbation is parallel to the magnetic field. The growth rate depends on whether the initial magnetic field is parallel or antiparallel to the angular momentum of the disc. The parallel case is less (more) unstable than the antiparallel case if the Hall current is dominated by negative (positive) species. The less-unstable orientation is stable for chi less than about 0. 5, where chi is the ratio of a generalised neutral-ion collision frequency to the Keplerian frequency. The other orientation has a formal growth rate of order the Keplerian angular frequency even in the limit that chi tends to zero!

40|$|Dusty plasmas in a gas {{discharge}} often feature a stable void, i. e., a dust-free region inside the dust cloud. This occurs under conditions relevant to both plasma processing discharges and plasma crystal experiments. The void {{results from a}} balance of the electrostatic and ion drag forces on a dust particle. The ion drag force is driven by a flow of ions outward from an ionization source and toward the surrounding dust cloud, which has a negative space charge. In equilibrium the force balance for dust particles requires that the boundary with the dust cloud be sharp, provided that the particles are cold and monodispersive. Numerical solutions of the one-dimensional nonlinear fluid equations are carried out including dust charging and dust-neutral collisions, but not ion-neutral collisions. The regions of parameter space that allow stable void equilibria are identified. There is a <b>minimum</b> <b>ionization</b> rate that can sustain a void. Spatial profiles of plasma parameters in the void are reported. In the absence of ion-neutral collisions, the ion flow enters the dust cloud's edge at Mach number M = 1.

Large voids contract and small voids expand until they attain this stationary void size. On the other hand, if the ionization rate is not constant, the void size can oscillate.

One of the primary science objectives of the CAL is to measure the energy spectra of nuclei from protons through iron up to 1, 000 TeV, and a secondary objective will be to measure the rare ultra-heavy (UH) cosmic ray (CR) abundances that provide important clues for the CR source and acceleration mechanism. The CAL will supplement the UH statistics it can measure with events passing within the full instrument geometry by utilizing the Earth’s geomagnetic field at the 51 : 6 inclination orbit of the ISS to select events that do not need energy determination in the Total Absorption Calorimeter (TASC). Ion-beam test data show that the Charge Detector (CHD) scintillator response is relatively insensitive to energy above <b>minimum</b> <b>ionization,</b> and the angle dependent rigidity {{as a function of}} geomagnetic latitude can be exploited to discriminate individual elements above this energy threshold. Such events require corrections for trajectory in the instrument that can be made with only the top 4 layers of the Imaging Calorimeter (IMC), which allows for considerably greater geometric acceptance than for events that require passage through the TASC for energy determination.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} two different subfields of atomic physics, {{thus it is}} divided into two different parts. ^ The first part (Chapters 2 and 3) investigates the potential barrier effects in multiphoton ionization of rare gas atoms, which are resonance-like enhancements of generalized multiphoton cross sections for XUV ionization of Ar, Kr, and Xe. The resonant-like behavior is demonstrated and analyzed within a single-active-electron, central-potential model. It is found that the resonance originates from the potential barriers experienced by intermediate- and final-state photoelectron wave packets corresponding to absorption of one, two, or three photons. The resonance-like profiles in the generalized three-photon ionization cross sections are shown to be similar to those found in the generalized two-photon ionization cross sections. Owing to the similarities found in both two- and three-photon generalized cross sections, we expect such potential barrier effects to be general features of multiphoton ionization processes in most atoms with occupied p and d subshells. The complexity of Cooper <b>minima</b> in multiphoton <b>ionization</b> processes is also discussed. ^ The second part (Chapter 4) presents intense laser acceleration of electrons in hydrogenlike highly charged ions, which can be ionized and subsequently accelerated up to GeV energies by a tightly-focused laser pulse with intensity approaching 1022 W/cm 2. Both quantum mechanical and classical relativistic approaches are briefly reviewed. Up to fifth order corrections to the paraxial approximation of the laser field are taken into account in classical relativistic simulations. It is shown that both the angle and energy of the laser accelerated electron depend on its initial position in the laser focus. ^ The results presented in Chapters 2 and 3 have been published, while those in Chapter 4 are currently under preparation for submission. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{binding energy}} spectra and {{electron}} momentum spectra of eight stable guanine tautomers are calculated in the complete valence space. The present {{results show that}} the canonical keto (C=O) guanine N(9) H tautomer (GU 1) possesses the largest dipole moment, molecular electronic spatial extent, molecular hardness value, and the <b>minimum</b> first vertical <b>ionization</b> potential (VIP). Valence orbital profile investigations find that several orbitals remain almost unchanged during tautomerization, such as frontier highest occupied molecular orbital 39 a and 18 a. Several orbitals with interchanged order and inverse direction in charge spatial orientations are also detected. Outer valence orbitals (with smaller VIPs) show more complex orbital shapes in the momentum space than those of inner ones (larger VIPs) due mainly to the relatively strong inter-orbital interaction and delocalized electronic distributions. Proton rotation along C&# 8211;O(H) and C&# 8211;N(H) axes within hexagonal ring causes smaller influence to orbital profiles than those of proton migration within pentagonal and/or hexagonal rings. Orbital variation trends between enol (GU 3 &# 8211;GU 5) and keto (GU 1, GU 2, GU 6 &# 8211;GU 8) tautomers are observed, including the signature orbitals of enol form, the variation tendency of total orbital intensity, and the variation order of the maximum orbital intensity. In the outer valence momentum space (outside 26 a), orbital composed by pz electrons show single peak with a gradual increasing peak site from 0. 5 a. u. of inner valence orbital to 1. 0 a. u. of outer valence orbital, whereas orbitals composed by px,y electrons form double peaks with respective sites at about 0. 5 and 1. 5 a. u., only three px,y-orbitals present single peaks (33 a, 34 a, 36 a). The general variation trends in the complete valence space for all the valence orbitals on their intensities, peak sites, and orbital components are concluded...|$|R
40|$|The cations {{of sulfur}} {{clusters}} exhibit intensities of significance on the mass spectra of sulfur clusters generated in direct laser vaporization. To our knowledge, theoretical investigations on cationic sulfur clusters are rare. Forty-nine isomers of sulfur clusters were acquired {{by means of}} the molecular model design, molecular mechanics and semi-empirical PM 3 and the recently proposed and widely used B 3 LYP hybrid, non-local, DFT method with basis set 6 - 31 G *. To look for stable configurations, full geometry optimizations at the 6 - 31 G * level for all sulfur atoms were performed using Gaussian 98 program packages. The initial models were constructed by means of breaking bond(s), making bond(s), adding atom(s), deleting atom(s), rotating fragment(s), translating fragment s) and merging fragment(s). The one-fold, two-fold and three-fold modes for modeling were considered, according to the bonding characteristics of the sulfur atom. Finally a total of eleven structures for S- 3 (+), S- 4 (+) and S- 5 (+) : ten isomers of S- 6 (+) and S- 7 (+); fifteen isomers of S- 8 (+) and S- 9 (+) and thirteen isomers of S- 10 (+), S- 11 (+), S- 12 (+) and S- 13 (+) are acquired, respectively. A large number of structural possibilities of non-minimum structures were not covered. According to total energies, the most stable S-n(+) (n = 3 similar to 13) isomers are predicted. The geometry, relative stability and structural rules of these cationic sulfur clusters were described. Some structures of neutral sulfur clusters with true <b>minima</b> transform upon <b>ionization</b> into non-minimum cationic structures and vice versa. The results of a large amount of calculations show that the two-fold coordination is generally favored in sulfur cationic clusters, though some sulfur atoms coordinated with the others in one-fold or three-fold mode are higher in total energy. The most stable isomer of some cationic clusters shows a structure completely {{different from that of the}} corresponding neutral cluster. In chain structures, the atoms at the two ends adopt the one-fold mode and the others are in two-fold mode. Theoretical studies on sulfur cationic structures with a three-fold atom are rare. It is unlikely to have a sulfur cationic cluster in cage structure, for the bondings of a three-fold atom are not strong enough. The calculation results can serve as guiding factors for future theoretical studies on large sulfur clusters...|$|R
40|$|The work of {{this thesis}} focuses on the {{interaction}} of high Rydberg states of hydrogen molecules and atoms with various doped Si semiconductor surfaces with the results compared with those obtained with an atomically flat gold surface. The {{major part of the}} thesis was carried out using para-H₂ molecular Rydberg states with principal quantum number n = 17 - 21 and core rotational quantum number N⁺ = 2. Subsequently, this study was continued using H atomic Rydberg states with principal quantum number n = 29 - 34. The high Rydberg states have been produced using two-step laser excitation. For close Rydberg surface separation (< 6 n² a. u.), the Rydberg states may be ionized due to an attractive surface potential experienced by the Rydberg electron, and the remaining ion core may be detected by applying an external electric field. An efficient ion detectability method is introduced to compare the many surface ionization profiles quantitatively. The p-type doped Si surfaces enhance the detected ion-signal more than the n-type doped Si surfaces due to the presence of widely distributed positive dopant charge fields in the p-type doped Si surfaces. As the dopant density increases, the area sampled by the resultant ions becomes effectively more neutral, and the decay rate of the potential from the surface dopant charge with distance from the surface becomes more rapid. Therefore, the <b>minimum</b> <b>ionization</b> distance is also reduced with increasing dopant density. It is found that the detected ion-signal decreases with increasing dopant density of both p- and n- type doped Si surfaces. The higher-n Rydberg states have shown higher ion detectability than that of lower-n Rydberg states and this variation also becomes smaller when increasing the dopant density. Experiments involving H 2 Rydberg molecules incident on various doped Si surfaces {{in the presence of a}} Stark field at the point of excitation are also presented here. The surface ionization profiles produced via both electron and ion detection schemes are measured by changing the Stark polarization. Positive surface dopant charges oppose production of backscattered electrons and negative surface dopant charges enhance the electron-signal. For the electron detection scheme, lightly doped n-type Si surfaces show higher detectability but in the case of p-type Si surfaces the more heavily doped Si surfaces give a higher detected signal. This different behaviour of the detected ion or electron signal implies a different production mechanism. Theoretical trajectory simulations were also carried out based on a new 2 D surface potential model. The results qualitatively agree with the experimental results and explain the changes of the surface ionization profiles between the various dopant types and dopant densities of the Si surfaces.

40|$|Early {{detection}} {{of breast cancer}} {{is the first step}} in prevention that can be done by women, therefore when one is diagnosed with breast cancer, the appropriate treatment can be performed quickly and accurately. Early diagnosis of breast cancer can be a way of mitigation in preventing breast cancer through the use of mammography. Bureau of Radiology as said by The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JHCA) stated that one of the responsibilities of the radiology unit is to control the quality of service which aims to minimize the radiographic image repetition factor; as well as maximizes the quality of radiographic image. Quality control tests are an effort that is needed on the mammography X-ray diagnostics tools. This is done to maintain the quality of expected output. The parameters that are included within the radiation output are the magnitude of current and the voltage of tube that are produced; therefore they remained constant and correspond to the recommended standard. Bureau of Radiological Health, as said by JHCA mentioned that to control the quality of image which will minimize the radiographic image repetition and maximizes the quality of radiographic image. Therefore the radiation output will not be dangerous later. The early stage of the quality control test on the machine was conducted by setting all the filtrations which were placed to capture the x-ray on the x-ray plane tube with <b>minimum</b> value. Then, <b>ionization</b> chamber is placed on the test subject points; right after that the distance between it to the radiation source is noted. The x-ray film is place on a film on the compression table of the patient and the distance between film and the focus point is noted. This is then exposed using a target filter Mo/Mo by setting the current as well as variation the voltage and time. The standard voltage measurements are 20 - 33 kVp. This data is from the observations of time exposure; the output value is then noted. The above procedure is conducted from the minimum voltage to the maximum voltage. The output ray is measured for each voltage. The same procedure is conducted to the target filter Mo/RH. The results obtained are that the greater the input voltage and current will subsequently produce greater doses, therefore the exposure has exceeded the standard limit 0. 1 mHy with longer exposure time. The HVL density thickness on the mammography X-ray machine determined the quality of the beam and the doses of x-ray exposure on the mammography machine. The output stability of x-ray beam exposure in the mammography machine mode Mo/Mo still fulfill the standard which is the value of 69...|$|R
40|$|Femtosecond time-resolved extreme-ultraviolet core-level {{absorption}} spectroscopy has {{developed into a}} powerful tool for investigating chemical dynamics due to its sensitivity for detecting changes in electronic structure. By probing the core-levels of atoms and molecules, dynamics may be monitored with elemental specificity, as well as localized sensitivity to the oxidation state around the atomic absorber. Previous experiments with this technique demonstrated the capability to quantitatively resolve strong-field ionization dynamics including the complete |j,m> quantum state distribution of Xe + and the dissociative ionization of CH 2 Br 2, both monitored in real-time with femtosecond resolution. In this thesis, the complete reconditioning of the experimental apparatus is described and its application to the study of vibrational wave packets created by strong-field ionization of Br 2 is discussed. Initially, the experimental apparatus was meant as a proof of principle demonstration for table-top extreme ultraviolet transient {{absorption spectroscopy}} based on a high-order harmonic generation source. To achieve the experiments discussed here, substantial changes were required to its construction concerning the high harmonic source and overall stability of the apparatus, which are discussed in terms of increasing the operation of the experiment to several days as opposed to a few hours, yielding an unprecedented spectral resolution after Fourier Transform of the signal versus pump-probe time delay for a table-top core-level spectrometer, better than 1. 5 cm - 1. The improvements to the apparatus are exploited in terms of examining the vibrational wave packet dynamics in Br 2 induced by optical strong-field ionization. First, extreme-ultraviolet transient absorption is established as a bond-length specific probe capable of resolving vibrational motion in Br 2 and due to a change in the transition amplitude and energy versus bond length of the 3 d 5 / 2, 3 / 2 core-level transitions to unoccupied molecular orbitals. Furthermore, the degree of coherence and beat composition of the 1 &Sigma + g ground state vibrational wave packet is established. Second, the preparation of vibrational wave packets by strong-field ionization of Br 2 is analyzed as a function of field intensity. At a field intensity near the threshold of ionization, selective depletion of the vibrational amplitude is observed near the inner turning point, corresponding to the <b>minimum</b> in the <b>ionization</b> energy for the unperturbed molecular potential energy curves. The observed superposition is determined to be primarily composed of the &nu 0 &nu 1 vibrational beat. As the field intensity is increased, perturbation of the potential curves results in preparation of the wave packet at longer internuclear separations, and the distortion of the potentials is directly observed by a shift in the core-level transition energy within the intense laser pulse. Moreover, the composition of the wave packet is found to involve higher vibrational levels, indicating the involvement of a Raman pumping mechanism in the preparation of the superposition. Third, several ongoing experiments utilize the unique instrumental capabilities including the elemental specificity and polarization dependence of the absorption. The elemental specificity and nuclear motion dependence of the core-level probe is utilized to investigate the correlated detection of vibrational wave packet dynamics in IBr on the iodine 4 d and bromine 3 d core-level absorptions simultaneously. Also, polarization dependent absorption of Xe 2 + looks to extend the quantitative measurements conducted for Xe + to determine the complete |j,m> state populations after sequential ionization. Lastly, polarization dependent measurements of the strong-field ionization of Br 2 suggest alignment between the molecular axis and the electric field of the ionizing pump at field intensities near the threshold for ionization, which is lost at higher field strengths. These studies expand the repertoire of capabilities for high-order harmonic generation beyond the proof of principle experiments and establish the technique as a practical tool for monitoring complex, ultrafast molecular dynamics by core-level probing. The capabilities of femtosecond transient absorption have since been expanded here to include the investigation of strong-field generated vibrational wave packets in molecular bromine. To this end, a theoretical model for determining the sensitivity of XUV absorption to valence vibrational motion generated by strong-field ionization was developed utilizing Restricted Excitation Window Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory coupled with internuclear separation, vibrational state sensitive Ammosov-Delone-Krainov tunnel ionization rates. This theoretical model, including details of traditional Ammosov-Delone-Krainov tunnel ionization rates, is presented in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 describes the experimental changes incorporated into the apparatus for successful multi-day experiments for the determination of vibrational dynamics with ~ 1 cm- 1 spectral resolution. Demonstration of the sensitivity of XUV transient absorption to non-stationary ground state vibrational dynamics is then presented in Chapter 4, investigating the vibrational superposition generated in Br 2 after irradiation with a 1. 6 x 10 14 W/cm 2 driving pump pulse. Chapter 5 expounds upon the dependence on field intensity to the observed vibrational dynamics in Br 2 as well as Br 2 +. Chapter 6 discusses the currently ongoing experiments being conducted for ground state vibrational wave packet preparation in iodine monobromide, the determination of the complete |j,m> quantum state population of Xe 2 +, and the alignment of the molecular axis of Br 2 with the electric field of the ionizing 800 nm field following strong-field ionization. Chapter 6 also presents the conclusions of the experimental work presented here as well as the future outlook of XUV transient absorption spectroscopy in the broader perspective of investigating chemical reaction and dynamics...|$|R
