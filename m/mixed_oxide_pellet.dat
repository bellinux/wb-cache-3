One of the spinel oxides reported was ZnTSb 2012 (Zn 2. 33 Sb 0. 6704), formed by reacting 7 moles of ZnO and 1 mole of 8 b 205 at high temperatures. This work was reproduced prior to this study by re-FORMATION OF ZnO-NbfO ~ SP INEL 209 acting a <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>pellet</b> of 7 ZnO-Sb 205 at 2200 ~ for 2 hr in air. X-ray diffraction analysis showed the spinel structure had formed with an Ao = 8. 603. An oxide pellet composed of ZnO, Sb 205, and Nb 205 in a 7 : 0. 5 : 0. 5 mole ratio was reacted under similar condi-tions to a spinel structure ZnT(Sb,Nb) 2012.

The reactivity of the ZnO-Sb 20 ~ mixed oxide pellets is much greater than that of ZnO-Nb 205 pellets due to the instabil ity of Sb 205 at the temperature of reaction.

40|$|In recent years, TiAl-based {{intermetallic}} alloys {{are being}} increasingly considered for application {{in areas such}} as (i) automobile/transport sector (passenger cars, trucks and ships) (ii) aerospace industry (jet engines and High Speed Civil Transport propulsion system) and (iii) industrial gas turbines. These materials offer excellent (i) high temperature properties (at higher than 6000 C) (ii) mechanical strength and (iii) resistance to corrosion and as a result have raised renewed interest. The combination of these properties make them possible replacement materials for traditional nickel-based super-alloys, which are nearly as twice as dense (than TiAl based alloys). Since the microstructures of these intermetallic alloys affect, to a significant extent, their ultimate performance, further improvements (by way of alteration/modification of these microstructures), have been the subject matter of intense research investigations. It has now been established that the presence of alloy additives, such as niobium, tantalum, manganese, boron, chromium, silicon, nickel and yttrium etc, in specific quantities, impart marked improvement to the properties, viz. fatigue strength, fracture toughness, oxidation resistance and room temperature ductility, of these alloys. From a number of possible alloy compositions, {gamma}-TiAl and Ti-Al-Nb-Cr have, of late, emerged as two promising engineering alloys/materials.. The conventional fabrication process of these alloys include steps such as melting, forging and heat treatment/annealing of the alloy compositions. However, an electrochemical process offers an attractive proposition to prepare these alloys, directly from the mixture of the respective oxides, in just one step. The experimental approach, in this new process, was, therefore, to try to electrochemically reduce the (<b>mixed)</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>pellet</b> to an alloy phase. The removal of oxygen, from the (<b>mixed)</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>pellet,</b> was effected by polarizing the oxide pellet against a graphite electrode in a pool of molten calcium chloride at a temperature of 9000 C. The dominant mechanism of the oxygen removal was the ionization of oxygen followed by its subsequent discharge, as CO 2 /CO, at the anode surface. The removal of oxygen from the oxide mixture helped form the alloy in situ.

Sol−gel chemistry conducted within the agarose gel produced "coral-like" interconnected networks of oxide nanoparticles with controllable quantities of zirconium and titanium.

The oxides were then tested for the adsorption of vanadyl and vanadate to determine which Zr mole fraction exhibited the highest capacity and fastest kinetics. The material containing 25 mol % Zr exhibited the highest surface area (322 ± 8 m 2 /g) of the compositions investigated and also displayed a superior adsorption rate and capacity. Vanadate adsorption occurred with faster kinetics than did vanadyl adsorption. A comparative study demonstrated that the macro/meso pore structure had improved transport properties over a monomodal mesopore structure of similar Zr/Ti composition.

The {{objective was to}} implement a simple procedure for verifying the declared Pu inventory {{which can be used}} either by analysts in the lab or by safeguards inspectors in field. A set of 6 MOX pellets taken from a MOX fuel fabrication facility and transported to the laboratory was used for the calibration. Another set of 5 pellets from the same facility was used to validate the calibration and to check the performance of the method. After recording gamma spectra and doing neutron measurements, both sets of pellets were characterized by destructive methods. The bias between Pu concentrations obtained from neutron measurements and from isotope-dilution mass-spectrometry was calculated. It was found to be between 0. 5 and 3 % depending on the calibration curve and on the source of isotopic data used for calculation. This accuracy may be sufficient for a quick preliminary assessment of the Pu inventory in MOX pellets by in-field instruments to immediately spot possible Pu diversion. However, to evaluate the material balance sending some pellets to the laboratory will remain required due to the smaller uncertainties achievable by destructive methods.

This result is expected as the steric effect of HPC. A <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> layer of zirconium and iron was observed in SIMS depth profiles. The <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> layer thickness showed a dependence on the acac molar ratio. Increases of acac shorted the overall film thickness, while the <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> layer was thicker. ZrO 2 -HPC coatings displayed however, a thicker <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> layer and additional increases of the zirconium intensity direct onto substrate surface. So a higher interdiffusion of zirconium into deeper layers and of iron towards coating surface was reached. XRD revealed that the <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> layer is localized between the substrate and coating surface and possess crystalline structure. At a HPC concentration = 0. 004 g/l no ZrO 2 reflexes could be detected. ZrO 2 crystals of 70 nm size were identified by TEM in ZrO 2 -acac coatings. However, ZrO 2 -HPC films showed an amorphous structure constituted of ZrO 2 and iron oxide containing nanocrystalline zirconium oxide particles immersed in the <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> layer. The crystals (monoclinic 112) size was between 5 and 10 nm. This result explains why there were not zirconium oxide reflexes visible in the XRD analysis. Obviously the ZrO 2 crystalline particles are too small (less than 10 nm) to be detected by XRD so they appear as amorphous material [83]. The particles are immersed in a compact and amorphous <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> matrix. The correlation between growth of the <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> phase and decrease of dissolution current density {{suggests that it is}} the <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> phase with zirconium nanoparticles that is responsible for the reduction of film porosity and the good corrosion protection properties of the films...|$|R
30|$|The pore {{structure}} configurates {{the presence of}} narrow pores for Co–Al mixed samples, probably indicating the formation of smaller particles size. Thus, Mn–Al <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> exhibits wide bimodal mesoporous nature which favors reactant and product diffusion; one might expect that this dual porosity makes a <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> superior candidate for catalytic reactions [25].|$|R
