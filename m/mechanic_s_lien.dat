40|$|Since September 20, 1957, the Nebraska {{oil and gas}} lien statute {{has been}} in effect. Prior to its passage, Nebraska had only a general {{mechanic}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statute. With a growing oil and gas drilling industry, it soon became apparent that due to the complexities and uniqueness of {{the oil and gas}} drilling business, the general mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statute had many shortcomings when it was stretched to include this industry. In some of these states the oil and gas drilling industry was brought within the terms of the more general mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statutes either by judicial construction or by slight amendment of their already existing mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statutes. In other jurisdictions, particularly those with a significant oil and gas drilling industry, special oil and gas lien statutes were enacted. Even though Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> general <b>mechanic</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statute can and often does cover many wide and varied contingencies, the complexities of the oil and gas drilling industry convinced many that a special statute, addressed specifically to this growing industry, was needed. As the oil and gas drilling industry in Nebraska grows in significance, Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s oil and gas lien statute will likewise grow in significance. It should become a necessary and familiar tool to those attorneys who do oil and gas work in Nebraska. While Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s statute is similar to other oil and gas lien statutes, many questions concerning this statute are at present unanswered...|$|R

A creditor asserting a security interest in his debtor 2 ̆ 7 s property is likely to find himself in competition with a wide assortment of other claimants.
