5000|$|IKON Office Solutions was {{a company}} based in Malvern, Pennsylvania. It was the world's largest {{independent}} provider of document management systems and services until it was purchased by manufacturer Ricoh in 2008. IKON uses copiers, printers and <b>multifunction</b> <b>printer</b> technologies from leading manufacturers and document management software and systems from companies like Captaris, Kofax, and EFI.|$|E
5000|$|Low-end copiers {{also use}} digital technology, but tend {{to consist of}} a {{standard}} PC scanner coupled to an inkjet or low-end laser printer, {{both of which are}} far slower than their counterparts in high-end copiers. However, low-end scanner-inkjets can provide color copying at a lower purchase price but with a much higher cost per copy. The cost of electronics is such that combined scanner-printers sometimes have built-in fax machines. (See <b>Multifunction</b> <b>printer.)</b> ...|$|E
30|$|Each color {{laser printer}} or <b>multifunction</b> <b>printer</b> had its unique {{distribution}} of the tracking dots inside the coded dots matrix (a repeated basic unit).|$|E
5000|$|Avision (...) is a Taiwan based company {{founded in}} 1991 that designs and {{produces}} image scanners and <b>multifunction</b> <b>printers.</b> The company {{was established in}} Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park in 1991.|$|R
50|$|In larger environments, print jobs may {{go through}} a {{centralized}} print server, before reaching the printing destination. Some (<b>multifunction)</b> <b>printers</b> have local storage (like a hard disk drive) to process and queue the jobs before printing.|$|R
50|$|Brother Industries, {{which is}} known for office {{electronics}} such as <b>multifunction</b> <b>printers</b> is based in Nagoya, as is Hoshizaki Electric, {{which is known}} for commercial ice machines and refrigeration equipment.

50|$|Duplex {{scanning}} {{is usually}} implemented on <b>multifunction</b> <b>printers</b> using a Reversing Automatic Document Feeder (RADF), which removes, reverses, and re-feeds the document after scanning one side. Duplex scanning is achieved on scanners by either RADF or by single pass duplex scanning using two cameras, {{one for each}} side of the document; two-camera scanners scan twice as fast as a similar two-pass scanner.|$|R
50|$|Document imaging is an {{information}} technology category for systems capable of replicating documents commonly used in business. Document imaging systems can take many forms including microfilm, on demand printers, facsimile machines, copiers, <b>multifunction</b> <b>printers,</b> document scanners, computer output microfilm (COM) and archive writers. Document Imaging means the conversion of paper files (of any size or description) or microfilm / fiche to digital images.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{input and output}} devices such as <b>multifunction</b> <b>printers</b> and {{computer-based}} navigation systems that are used for specialized or unique applications. In computing, input/output refers to the communication between an information processing system (such as a computer), and the outside world. Inputs are the signals or data received by the system, and outputs are the signals or data sent from it.|$|R
50|$|Consumer and low-to-medium volume office {{printers}} use a duplexing {{unit that}} reverses {{a piece of}} paper after the first side has been printed. Duplex <b>multifunction</b> <b>printers</b> that also support duplex scanning have a reversing automatic document feeder (RADF) for scanning both sides. Higher volume printers may effectively have two print engines in a single device, and are able to print both sides of the paper in a single pass.|$|R

50|$|Canon is {{organised}} into three principal business segments: the Office Business Unit (the products of which include copying machines, digital production printers, large format inkjet printers, laser printers and multi-function devices); the Consumer Business Unit (the products of which include broadcasting equipment, calculators, compact digital cameras, digital SLR cameras, digital video camcorders, image scanners, interchangeable lenses, inkjet <b>multifunction</b> <b>printers</b> and single function inkjet printers); and the Industry and Others Business Unit (the products of which include computers, handy terminals, LCD lithography equipment, magnetic heads, medical imaging equipment, micromotors, ophthalmic equipment and semiconductor lithography equipment).|$|R
5000|$|... {{almost all}} <b>printer</b> {{manufacturers}} offer <b>multifunction</b> <b>printers.</b> They {{are designed for}} home, small business, enterprise and commercial use. Naturally, the cost, usability, robustness, throughput, output quality, etc. all vary with the various use cases. However, they all generally do the same functions; Print, Scan, Fax, and Photocopy. In the commercial/enterprise area, most MFP have used laser-printer technology, while the personal, SOHO environments, utilize inkjet methods. Typically, inkjet printers have struggled with delivering the performance and color-saturation demanded by enterprise/large business use. [...] However, HP has recently launched a business-grade MFP using inkjet technology.|$|R
5000|$|HP Open Extensibility Platform (HP OXP), {{developed}} by Hewlett-Packard Co., is an enterprise software development platform {{that consists of}} three unique layers. 1) HP OXPd, the device layer, enables document workflow applications, 2) HP OXPm, the management layer, exposes functionality for management software like HP Web Jetadmin, and 3) HP OXPw, the workflow layer, embeds web services technology into software like the HP Universal Printer Driver (HP UPD). The device layer, or HP OXPd, provides a software development kit (SDK) for creating document workflow applications based on standard web service protocols. Document workflow applications are value-added software applications designed specifically to increase user productivity while interacting with <b>multifunction</b> <b>printers</b> ("MFPs").|$|R
40|$|The system {{described}} in this paper attempts to tackle the problem of finding online content based on paper documents through an intuitive touchscreen interface designed for modern scanners and <b>multifunction</b> <b>printers.</b> Touch Scan-n-Search allows the user to select elements of a scanned document (e. g. a newspaper article) and to seamlessly connect to common web search services in order to retrieve the online version of the document along with related content. This is achieved by automatically extracting keyphrases from text elements in the document (obtained by OCR) and creating “tappable ” GUI widgets to allow the user to control and fine-tune the search requests. The retrieved content can then be printed, sent, or used to compose new documents...|$|R
5000|$|Compatible ink is {{manufactured}} {{for several}} types of machines including fax machines, laser <b>printers,</b> inkjet <b>printers,</b> <b>multifunction</b> <b>printers,</b> and copiers. Aside from compatible products, three other sources of consumables are also available to supply these machines, including OEM brand ink and toner, remanufactured toner and ink cartridges, and refilled ink and toner cartridges. Compatible ink manufacturers differentiate their product by using all new parts, whereas other ink replacements recycle used OEM parts.. Compatible ink and toner products tend to offer greater value than original, genuine OEM ink and toner cartridges. Reducing cost for the end user, ink and toner manufactured by third party manufacturers is classified as compatible when consisting of new parts for a third party printer.|$|R
30|$|A new preset of Adobe® Photoshop® CC 2018 {{has applied}} as an {{indirect}} and nondestructive technique on ninety-one color laser printout samples from twenty-two color laser machines (<b>printers</b> & <b>multifunction</b> <b>printers)</b> {{with the same}} and different models of Xerox® brand. We could successfully extract and measure all distance spaces around and inside the coded dots matrix corresponding to each color laser printout of Xerox® samples. Furthermore, we have figured out that all color laser printout samples studied from the same and different Xerox® brand models had the tracking dots with a defined configuration spread onto the color laser printouts in a regular grid of dots (pattern) – as row and column arrangements. The defined configuration of the basic unit of the tracking dots matrix (pattern) corresponding to the color laser of Xerox® brand named with “the coded dots matrix” pattern. All studied coded dots matrices composed of fifteen columns and eight rows in a regular grid pattern with a unique distribution of yellow tracking dots inside their patterns. The coded dots matrix (CDM) patterns studied exhibited mainly information about the machine serial number and model. Furthermore, according to the variation in the model sizes of the color laser printers of Xerox® brand, we found not all the coded dots matrix patterns exhibited the time and date for the printing process, but all <b>multifunction</b> <b>printers</b> only exhibited this feature. Therefore, we have introduced a new method {{could be applied to}} distinguish between two or more color laser Xerox® printouts of the same model with different serial numbers, and different models in digital forensic labs – with an accuracy ratio reached to 100 %. This study is being a part of series studies that currently have been carrying out on different color laser brands.|$|R
40|$|Scanned {{halftone}} {{images are}} degraded {{for the presence}} of screen patterns. It’s a challenge to automatically detect the halftone images and remove the noises on the fly. This paper proposes a novel adaptive real-time descreening method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and modified Smoothing over Univalue Segment Assimilating Nucleus (SUSAN) filter for imaging devices, including scanners and <b>multifunction</b> <b>printers.</b> The proposed algorithm contains two major steps: image classification and adaptive descreening. The image classification uses SVM methods to accurately classify the scanned images into three categories: continuous tone, amplitude modulation (AM) halftone or frequency modulation (FM) halftone. The halftone images are needed to descreen. The proposed descreening method is based on modified SUSAN filter. It considers screen cell size to choose the optimal filter parameters which can preserve more high frequency image detail. The experiment results show that the algorithm is effective and fully automatism, and maintains higher image quality...|$|R
50|$|Oki Data Americas, Inc., a {{subsidiary}} of Oki Data Corporation of Japan, produces PC peripheral equipment under the OKI brand, including digital color and monochrome printers, serial impact dot matrix <b>printers,</b> <b>multifunction</b> products and facsimiles.|$|R
50|$|Another key {{aspect of}} the {{paperless}} office philosophy is the conversion of paper documents, photos, engineering plans, microfiche {{and all the other}} paper based systems to digital documents. Technologies that may be used for this include scanners, digital mail solutions, book copiers, wide format scanners (for engineering drawings), microfiche scanners, fax to PDF conversion, online post offices, <b>multifunction</b> <b>printers</b> and document management systems. Each of these technologies uses software that converts the raster formats (bitmaps) into other forms depending on need. Generally, they involve some form of image compression technology that produces smaller raster images or use optical character recognition (OCR) to convert a document into text. A combination of OCR and raster is used to enable search ability while maintaining the original form of the document. An important step is the labeling related to paper-to-digital conversion and the cataloging of scanned documents. Some technologies have been developed to do this, but they generally involve either human cataloging or automated indexing on the OCR document. However, scanners and software continue to improve with the development of small, portable scanners that are able to scan doubled-sided A4 documents at around 30-35ppm to a raster format (typically TIFF fax 4 or PDF).|$|R
