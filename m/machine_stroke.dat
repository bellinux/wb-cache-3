40|$|In this paper, {{debonding}} phenomena between {{carbon fiber}} reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips and masonry support were investigated {{on the basis}} of single-lap shear tests, considering different dimensions of the bond length. To capture the post-peak response of the CFRP–masonry joint, the slip between the support and the reinforcement strip was controlled using a clip gauge positioned {{at the end of the}} reinforcement. The tests were simulated by means of a finite element model able to capture the post-peak snap-back behavior due to the failure process. The numerical model is based on zero-thickness interface elements and on a proper non-linear cohesive law. The comparison between experimental and numerical results was performed in terms of overall response, measured by both the <b>machine</b> <b>stroke</b> and the clip gauge positioned at the free end of the reinforcement.

40|$|In {{the present}} studies, the Leuven Tennis Performance Test (LTPT), a newly {{developed}} test procedure to measure stroke performance in match-like conditions in elite tennis players, was evaluated {{as to its}} value for research purposes. The LTPT is enacted on a regular tennis court. It consists of first and second services, and of returning balls projected by a machine to target zones indicated by a lighted sign. Neutral, defensive, and offensive tactical situations are elicited by appropriately programming the <b>machine.</b> <b>Stroke</b> quality is determined from simultaneous measurements of error rate, ball velocity, and precision of ball placement. A velocity/precision (VP) an a velocity/precision/error (VPE) index are also calculated. The validity and sensitivity of the LTPT were determined by verifying whether LTPT scores reflect minor differences in tennis ranking {{on the one hand}} and the effects of fatigue on the other hand. Compared with lower ranked players, higher ones made fewer errors (P < 0. 05). In addition, stroke velocity was higher (P < 0. 05), and lateral stroke precision, VP, and VPE scores were better (P < 0. 05) in the latter. Furthermore, fatigue induced by a prolonged tennis load increased (P < 0. 05) error rate and decreased (P < 0. 05) stroke velocity and the VP and VPE indices. It is concluded that the LTPT is an accurate, reliable, and valid instrument for the evaluation of stroke quality in high-level tennis players. status: publishe...|$|E

30|$|The {{applicable}} standard, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 6892 - 1 (ISO 6982 - 1 2016), {{refers to}} a method for measuring the ductility of bulk metal using its elongation and reduction of area. In general, the elongation is measured from the extension of a wire. The extension is measured by an extensometer, not by the stroke increment of a cross-head (henceforth simply {{referred to as the}} stroke increment) which is measured by the rotation angle of a ball screw in a universal testing <b>machine.</b> The <b>stroke</b> increment should be smaller than the genuine extension. This is because cross-heads bend during tensile testing due the application of a large tensile load to the wire. Therefore, the ISO standard recommends an extensometer be placed upon the tested wire. The reduction of area is calculated from the diameter of a wire prior to tensile testing, and the diameter at the most constricted point after tensile testing is complete. These diameters are measured by joining fractured pieces.|$|R

40|$|The main {{research}} {{topic of}} this dissertation thesis {{deals with the}} influence of the working accuracy related to large CNC machines on the required workpiece properties. The state-of-the art has constantly been developed and the customer’s requirements directed to manufacturers of the machine tools are increasingly demanding. There is required a high accuracy, reliability, shortening delivery times etc. The manufacturer is expected to fulfill all the customer’s requirements. The machining accuracy is dependent, among others, on the positioning accuracy of a machine tool that represents the position of the cutting tool relative to a workpiece. The accuracy of a particular machine tool is therefore a limiting factor concerned with reaching the highest accuracy and quality of a workpiece. Acceptance test procedures are initially realized within a manufacturing shop floor and then within a customer environment. The main subject of the testing procedures is to verify. basic properties of a machine tool such as basic dimensions of a <b>machine,</b> <b>strokes</b> in all respective coordinates, machine travels and spindle speeds. A machining of a workpiece with a desired precision specified by the customer is also performed. In this thesis, a new methodology to calculate and determine errors concerned with machining on vertical lathes is proposed with the aim of predicting the machining accuracy of CNC machine tools. The objective of this work was to determine the influence of machining accuracy of a CNC machine in connection with a subsequent geometrical accuracy of a workpiece. Considered position of a tool relative to a workpiece will be affected by errors concerned with a kinematical inaccuracy, geometrical errors and errors related to machining forces. A vertical lathe SKIQ 30 produced by TOSHULIN, a. s. {{has been used as a}} testing machine on which the proposed methodology has been verified. During processing various calculations in this thesis there has been found out that the machining inaccuracy of the machine – main topic of interest – is influenced by the machining conditions such as cutting conditions, material to be machined and even the setting of working positions of the machine. For instance, a position of the cross slide is determined by a workpiece height and a position of the lathe carriage that is determined by a workpiece diameter and a travel of the slide that is also determined by a workpiece height. It can be stated then that to predict the machining accuracy of work pieces, it is important to know the behavior of the machine in its all range of working envelope. Based on the information acquired about the behavior of the machine, it can be determined an appropriate position for a workpiece setting that allows utilizing the maximum reachable accuracy with respect to the stiffness and geometrical accuracy of the machine tool. An appropriate setting of initial working position may influence the subsequent geometrical accuracy of a workpiece...|$|R

40|$|The {{interactions}} between stiffness and workspace performances are studied. The stiffness in x, y and z directions {{as well as}} the workspace of a 3 -UPU mechanism are studied and optimized. The stiffness of the robotic system in every single moveable direction is measured and analyzed, and it is observed that in the case where one tries to make the x and y translational stiffness larger, the z directional stiffness will be reduced, i. e. the x and y translational stiffness contradicts with the one in z direction. Subsequently, the objective functions for the summation of the x and y translational stiffness and z directional stiffness are established and they are being optimized simultaneously. However, we later found that these two objectives are not in the same scale; a normalization of the objectives is thus taken into consideration. Meanwhile, the robotic system’s workspace is studied and optimized. Through comparing the stiffness landscape and the workspace volume landscape, it is also observed that the z translational stiffness shows the same changing tendency with the workspace volume’s changing tendency while the x and y translational stiffness shows the opposite changing tendency compared to the workspace volume’s. Via employing the Pareto front theory and differential evolution, the summation of the x and y translational stiffness and the volume of the workspace are being simultaneously optimized.

40|$|Abstract. Stroke is {{a leading}} cause of {{disability}} in particular affecting older people. Although the causes of stroke are well known and it is possible to reduce these risks, {{there is a need to}} improve rehabilitation techniques. Early studies in the literature suggest that early intensive therapies can enhance patient‟s recovery. According to physiotherapy literature, attention and motivation are key factors for motor relearning following <b>stroke.</b> <b>Machine</b> mediated therapy offers a great potential to improve the outcome of patients engaged on rehabilitation for upper limb motor impairment. Haptic Interfaces are a particular group of Robots that are attractive due to their ability to safely interact with humans. They can enhance traditional therapy tools, provide therapy “on demand ” and can present accurate objective measurements of patient‟s progression. Our recent studies suggest the use of tele-presence and VR-based systems can potentially motivate patients to exercise for longer periods of time. The creation of human-like trajectories is essential for retraining upper limb movements of patients that have lost manipulation functions following stroke. By coupling models for human arm movement with haptic interfaces and VR technology it is possible to create a new class of robot mediated neuro rehabilitation tools. This paper provides an overview on different approaches to robot mediated therapy and describes a system based on haptics and virtual reality visualisation techniques, where particular emphasis is given to different control strategies for interaction derived from minimum jerk theory and the aid of virtual and mixed reality based exercises...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} margin preparation design and resin-composite type on microleakage with or without re-application of surface-penetrating sealant. METHODS: Class-I resin-composite restorations were completed for 128 extracted human molars. Half of the margins were beveled, the other half, butt-joint. Half of each group was restored with Filtek-Supreme (FS), the other half with Esthet-X (EX) using their respective adhesive systems. Margins were etched and sealed with a surface-penetrating sealant, Fortify. The samples were stored in water 24 h, and thermocycled (5, 000 cycles, 5 °C- 55 °C). Then, samples were abraded using a toothbrush <b>machine</b> (6, 000 <b>strokes).</b> Half of the restorations from each sealant group (n= 16) were resealed, {{and the other half}} had no further treatment. Thermocycling and tooth brushing were repeated. The samples were sealed with nail polish, immersed in methylene-blue for 8 h, sectioned, and magnified digital photographs were taken. Three examiners assessed dye penetration. A 2 × 2 × 2 multi-layered Chi-Square analysis, using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was conducted for statistical analysis. RESULTS: No difference was observed between sealed and resealed FS and EX restorations with butt-joint margins. In beveled margins, resealing caused significantly less microleakage (P 3 ̆c. 01). No differences were found between restorations either sealed or resealed with bevel margins. In butt-joint margins, at the leakage level deeper than 2 / 3 of the preparation depth, resealed FS showed less microleakage than EX resealed restorations (P 3 ̆c. 01). CONCLUSION: Resealing reduced microleakage in bevel margins, however, in butt-joint margins resealing did not affect the leakage.

The testing was conducted using a servo hydraulic testing <b>machine</b> at nominal <b>stroke</b> rates ranging between 0. 00083 in/sec to 500 in/sec. A maximum average shear strain rate of 654 rad/sec was achieved up to shear strain levels of 0. 08 radians, during the tests. The stress-strain behavior of all material systems exhibited contrasting behavior with increasing stroke rates. The stress-strain curves for all materials exhibited an asymptotic behavior for stroke rates approaching 10 in/sec and were material dependent for stroke rates exceeding 250 in/sec.

40|$|Rapid {{compression}} machines (RCM) are laboratory devices used {{to measure}} gas-phase fuel reactivity at conditions relevant to combustion engines. Test mixtures are generally prepared by rapidly compressing a gas phase fuel+oxidizer+diluent mixture to {{high pressure and temperature}} (e. g., 10 - 50 bar, 650 - 1000 K). It is extremely challenging to utilize diesel-relevant liquid fuels in these devices due to their involatility. One proposed method involves the delivery of an aerosol of suspended fuel droplets (∼ 0. 1 mLfuel/Lgas at stoichiometric fuel loading) to the <b>machine.</b> The compression <b>stroke</b> of the RCM subsequently heats the gas phase of the aerosol thereby achieving vaporization of the fuel. The properties of the aerosol delivered to the RCM such as the droplet size distribution (DSD) are critical to ensuring successful execution of the experiments. For instance, the fuel droplets must be smaller than a critical threshold (e. g., d 0 ∼ 6 - 10 μm to ensure timely fuel evaporation and gas-phase mixing; in addition, the droplets must resist gravitational forces that could cause them to fall out of suspension. Low aerosol velocities are required in order to minimize fluid motion and thus heat loss from the compressed reacting gases during the RCM experiment. An aerosol model has been developed in this thesis project {{in order to understand the}} aerosol dynamics during the generation and machine delivery processes. Issues such as droplet impingement, coagulation, evaporation and settling can be investigated with the model, and thus the configuration (i. e., intake valve geometry, mixing chamber design, etc.) and operational characteristics (i. e., gas flow rates, fuel loading, etc.) of the aerosol RCM can be understood/improved/optimized.
