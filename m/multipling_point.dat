40|$|A {{high-speed}} {{measuring system}} of <b>multiple</b> <b>points</b> {{is becoming an}} important issue in many industrial applications. Therefore, {{the development of a}} high-speed position sensor is an important issue. However, conventional sensors such as CCD(charge-coupled device) and PSD(position-sensitive detector) are insufficient to apply to the high-speed measurement of <b>multiple</b> <b>points.</b> We propose a new position sensor for high-speed measurement of <b>multiple</b> <b>points.</b> The proposed sensor features a single scanning detecting method of <b>multiple</b> <b>points</b> by parallel processing technique and design of the sensor by analog circuitry, which makes high-speed measurement of <b>multiple</b> <b>points</b> possible. The designed sensor system realizes both high-speed performance and high accuracy </p...|$|R

40|$|Using <b>multiple</b> <b>point</b> spaces {{some new}} {{examples}} of perverse sheaves on images of maps are described. Furthermore, suppose f : X ! Y is a finite and proper map of complex analytic manifolds of dimension n and n + 1 such that every <b>multiple</b> <b>point</b> space is non-singular {{and has the}} dimension expected of a generic map. Then we can describe the composition series for the constant sheaf on the image {{in the category of}} perverse sheaves. 1 Introduction Suppose f : X ! Y is a finite and proper complex analytic map, (here finite means that each fibre is a finite set). The closure of the set of points in the images with k or more preimages is denoted M k and is called the k th <b>multiple</b> <b>point</b> set in the image (also called an image <b>multiple</b> <b>point</b> set). In [7] it was shown that in certain cases the constant sheaf of rational numbers on M k was perverse, even though the spaces were not (obviously) complete intersections.

A generic qualitative research process is traced starting from {{the ways in which}} researchers obtain permission to gather data in organizations. <b>Multiple</b> <b>points</b> of view in the research process, all of which may introduce bias into research results, are considered next. These include researcher/s, research institution, funding body, client organization, and individual participants. Finally bias effects from these <b>multiple</b> <b>points</b> of view are considered at analysis, interpretation and reporting of research results for organizational information systems. The position taken in this paper is that there is inevitable bias in qualitative research that may have many effects. The appropriateness of a `scientific' approach to bias in qualitative research in organizational information systems is also considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of a novel multipoint Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) is described. This instrument enables the non-contact measurement of vibration at <b>multiple</b> <b>points</b> on a target surface simultaneously. This system offers benefits over existing LDV scanning products in that <b>multiple</b> <b>points,</b> in this case 16, are simultaneously investigated. A novel Doppler signal processing technique achieves the preservation of phase information between measurement points, while vibration displacement and velocity time histories are both continuously provided as output data. Efficient data compression allows easy visualization {{of the dynamics of}} the surface under test. As a result, transient phenomena on <b>multiple</b> <b>points</b> can be investigated; vibration of damped materials can be accurately measured and power flow through composite structures analysed. Two examples of its application on a guitar, to acquire data not readily obtainable by other means, are presented in this paper...|$|R
