The other view is an egalitarian or humanitarian one, which is associated with <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> outgroups.|$|E

The relationship between CEO age and organisational age culture for younger employees was negative for CEOs with a less <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> younger employees and positive for those with a <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> younger employees.

50|$|Reading {{interventions}}.Reading interventions typically {{take place}} in schools and last an average of 5 weeks. They attempt to influence prejudiced beliefs {{through the use of}} engaging stories. Often these stories highlight positive interactions between children who are similar to those receiving the intervention and children who differ from them based on their membership in a stigmatized group. Furthermore, when an emphasis is placed on individual characteristics as opposed to group membership, an experience of vicarious intergroup friendship occurs, and this leads to <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> children from stigmatized groups. There is little knowledge, however, of how such interventions influence children’s behavior in actual intergroup interactions.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} of psychosocial stress and <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> illness to psychological adjustment among youth with chronic arthritis. Methods Seventy-five youths with chronic arthritis aged 8 – 18 years were administered a semi-structured interview assessing illness-related and nonillness-related stressors in important life domains. Children also completed measures of <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> illness, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. Parents com-pleted a measure of child psychosocial adjustment. Results Higher levels of illness-related and nonillness-related stress were associated {{with higher levels of}} anxiety and depressive symp-toms and parent-reported adjustment problems, while a <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> illness was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. <b>Attitude</b> <b>toward</b> illness moderated the relationship between stress and depressive symptoms.

40|$|To deepen our {{understanding}} of young adults’ sibling relationships in the Italian context, this study examines {{the psychometric properties of}} the Italian adaptation and validation of the Lifespan Sibling Relationship Scale (LSRS) in a sample of 350 Italian university students (68. 6 % females, 31. 4 % males; ages 19 - 30 yr., M = 23. 6, SD = 3. 2). Confirmatory factor analysis showed the expected six-factor structure and a close correlation between factors and scales. Internal consistency was adequate and correlation analysis with the Adult Sibling Relationship Questionnaire (ASRQ) confirmed the theoretical relations among the constructs. The findings confirm the transcultural validity of the LSRS. Moreover, results are consistent with research findings, indicating that: women show a <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> sibling relationships, especially when reporting their relationship with sisters; older siblings show a <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> sibling relationships; perception of current maternal and paternal partiality is related to negative <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> sibling relationships...|$|R
50|$|In {{psychological}} studies, {{the term}} {{is often used to}} describe degree of (general) sexual aversion versus (general) interest in sex. In this sense erotophobia is descriptive of one's place in a range on a continuum (theory) of sexual feeling or aversion to feeling. Erotophobes score high {{on one end of the}} scale that is characterized by expressions of guilt and fear about sex. Psychologists sometimes attempt to describe sexuality on a personality scale. Erotophobes are less likely to talk about sex, have more negative reactions to sexually explicit material, and have sex less frequently and with fewer partners over time. In contrast, erotophiles score high on the opposite end of the scale, erotophilia, which is characterized by expressing less guilt about sex, talking about sex more openly, and holding <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> sexually explicit material.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Interactive {{marketing}} communication and relationship personalization present {{some of the}} most recent developments in the field of {{marketing communication}}s. This paper analyzes consumers' attitudes towards the two concepts. Methodology: This study used an online survey on a convenience sample of Internet users in Croatia and a telephone survey (CATI method) on a representative sample of Croatian citizens. Findings: Two main hypotheses researched in this paper are: consumers have a <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> interactive marketing communication than toward one-way communication (H 1); consumers have a <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> relationship personalization than toward classical transactional relationship (H 2). It was found that consumers do want interactive communication, but they are more rigorous about personalization. H 1 was accepted, while H 2 was accepted only for certain industries. Implications: These findings have implications for the direction of relationship development with consumers. They provide an insight into how consumers want to communicate with companies and organizations and what level of personalization they expect or require. In addition, the findings indicate what companies or organizations should do in order to draw consumers into interactive personalized relationships...|$|R
