5|$|Meetings usually {{began at}} dawn, {{although}} occasionally certain events (such as festivals) might delay {{the beginning of}} a meeting. A <b>magistrate</b> who wished to summon the Senate had to issue a compulsory order (a cogere), and senators could be punished if they failed to appear without reasonable cause. In 44 BC for example, consul Mark Antony threatened to demolish the house of the former consul Cicero for this very reason. The Senate meetings were technically public because the doors were usually left open, which allowed people to look in, but only senators could speak. The Senate was directed by a presiding <b>magistrate,</b> who was usually either a consul (the highest-ranking <b>magistrate)</b> or, if the consul was unavailable, a Praetor (the second-highest ranking <b>magistrate).</b> By the late Republic, another type of <b>magistrate,</b> a plebeian tribune, would sometimes preside.|$|E
5|$|Only Roman {{citizens}} (both plebeians and patricians) had {{the right}} to confer magisterial powers (potestas) on any individual <b>magistrate.</b> The most important power was imperium, which was held by consuls (the chief magistrates) and by praetors (the second highest-ranking ordinary <b>magistrate).</b> Defined narrowly, imperium simply gave a <b>magistrate</b> the authority to command a military force. Defined more broadly, however, imperium gave a <b>magistrate</b> the constitutional authority to issue commands (military, diplomatic, civil, or otherwise). A magistrate's imperium was at its apex while the <b>magistrate</b> was abroad. While the <b>magistrate</b> was in the city of Rome itself, however, he had to completely surrender his imperium, so that liberty (libertas) was maximized. Magistrates with imperium sat in a curule chair, and were attended by lictors (bodyguards) who carried axes called fasces which symbolized {{the power of the state}} to punish and to execute. Only a <b>magistrate</b> with imperium could wear a bordered toga, or be awarded a triumph.|$|E
5|$|A {{complex set}} of checks and {{balances}} developed between these three branches. For example, the assemblies theoretically held all power, but were called and governed by the magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. Similarly, to check the power of the magistrates, each <b>magistrate</b> could veto one of their colleagues and the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto the actions of a <b>magistrate.</b>|$|E

5|$|Each republican <b>magistrate</b> held certain {{constitutional}} powers. Only the People of Rome (both plebeians and patricians) had {{the right}} to confer these powers on any individual <b>magistrate.</b> The most powerful constitutional power was imperium. Imperium was held by both consuls and praetors. Imperium gave a <b>magistrate</b> the authority to command a military force. All magistrates also had the power of coercion. This was used by magistrates to maintain public order. While in Rome, all citizens could seek judgment against coercion. This protection was called provocatio (see below). Magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens. This power would often be used to obstruct political opponents.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the presiding <b>magistrate,</b> several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants. There were also religious officials known as augurs either in attendance or on-call, who {{would be available to}} help interpret any signs from the gods (omens). On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used the claim of unfavorable omens as an excuse to suspend a session that was not going the way they wanted. Any decision made by a presiding <b>magistrate</b> could be vetoed by a <b>magistrate</b> known as a Plebeian Tribune. In addition, decisions made by presiding magistrates could also be vetoed by higher-ranking magistrates.|$|E

There are two necessary components to any assembly: (1) the convening <b>magistrate</b> and (2) the citizens in the assembly itself. Assemblies did not participate or discuss matters laid before them, they heard the speakers put forth by the presiding officer.
