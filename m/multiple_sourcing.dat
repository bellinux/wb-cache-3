40|$|ABSTRACT. Purchasers {{frequently}} {{face the}} choice of buying goods or services from one or from more suppliers. In this paper we review the reasons why {{one or the other}} alternative is preferred. Then we analyze these reasons {{in the context of the}} shifting goals of public procurement as given by Erridge and McIlroy (2002). It is argued that the more recent and further reaching goals of public procurement will lead to more cases of <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> in public procurement. Finally we explore the use of multiple lots in public procurement against the background of the discussion on multiple goals and <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing.</b> We conclude that multiple lots and <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> should be combined to achieve the goals of public procurement...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} primary {{cross-industry}} survey data collected in an emerging market, namely Turkey, {{in order to}} examine and interpret the perceptions of professionals on procurement risk hedging and management. In this process, we employ ordered logit models in order to decipher the likelihood of an operational hedging strategy, i. e., <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing,</b> and a financial hedging strategy, i. e., using financial derivatives, and their main drivers. We show that the likelihood of hedging via <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> and financial derivatives are associated with drivers such as supplier and commodity market characteristics, managerial perceptions regarding the historical operational risk events and supply contract parameters. We also show that the impact of these drivers is intimately different on <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> and financial derivatives...|$|E

40|$|Relationships between {{buying and}} selling {{organizations}} in business markets are varied and complex. One important relationship is procurement, or the type of alliance that buyers form with sellers to fulfill their purchasing needs. <b>Multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> is often proposed to prevent a variety of procurement problems. We develop a bidding model to investigate the effect of <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> on competitive behavior prior to supplier selection. The model treats the number of bidders (and the decision to bid) endogenously. This distinctive feature allows us {{to show that the}} distribution of the number of bids is not independent of the competition type. Most previous models have not considered this question at all. Although <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> does increase participation in a bidding competition, we show that it can lead to strategic pre-award price increases that can mitigate the effects of the advantages stressed by most previous analyses of post-award supplier management. business marketing, equilibrium, decision analysis, procurement...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} sourcing {{issues in}} the manufacturing industry. With the guidance of a truck manufacturer, the researcher looks into how manufacturers make their sourcing decisions, with the ultimate goal to find out differences, similarities, advantages and disadvantages with single and <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing.</b> In few words, this research tries to understand better in which situations single sourcing is more appropriate than multiple, and vice versa, {{in the context of}} a manufacturing company. A qualitative method of analysis was chosen for this case study, under which published related literature, as secondary data, and interviews with professional buyers, as primary data, were used to shed light on the single versus <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> dilemma. Specifically, to collect the primary data, the researcher interviewed buyers from both the truck manufacturer that initiated this research and from other manufacturing companies. It was found out that sourcing is a lengthy procedure, and that sourcing strategies must consider product and market characteristics, geography, and the particular circumstances under which a sourcing decision is taken. The final suggestion for the truck manufacturer is to incorporate <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> to a greater degree into their purchasing routines. The significance of this research lies primarily in the fact that it presents the main characteristics of the two approaches, and as such, it provides information, which can give clarifications to the truck manufacturer that initiated it. Other than that, it has potential use to any company investigating whether single or <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> is more appropriate for them...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{stochastic}} inventory models {{that focus on}} the following two aspects in particular: (i) the coordination of multiple supply sources and (ii) the optimization of the inventory allocation and sizing in multi-echelon systems. Initially, single-echelon inventory models with <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> and multi-echelon inventory models with single sourcing are analyzed separately. In the former case, the goal is the identification of effective inventory control policies. In the latter case, the focus lies on {{the development of a new}} multi-echelon approach, which combines the two major frameworks currently available in the literature. Subsequently, both aspects are integrated into a multi-echelon inventory model with <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing...</b>|$|E

We present a hierarchical extension of the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), the most widespread method for supplier rating in the literature, for application in a <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> strategy context. The proposed hierarchical technique is based on three levels. First, a modified DEA approach is {{used to evaluate the}} efficiency of each supplier according to some criteria proposed by the buyer. Second, the well known Technique for Order Preference by Similarities to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied to rank the maximally efficient suppliers given by the previous step. Third and finally, a linear programming problem is stated and solved to find the quantities to order from each maximally efficient supplier in the <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> context. The presented approach is able to straightforwardly discern between efficient and inefficient partners, avoid the confusion between efficient and effective suppliers, and split the supply in a <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> context. The hierarchical model is applied to the supply of a C class component to show its robustness and effectiveness, while comparing it with the DEA and TOPSIS approaches...|$|E

A systematic and good purchasing olan figes positive impact in many ways. In RMK 8 (eighth Malaysia Plan), government has give more attention to manufacturing industry in contributing sountry income. There are basically two purchasing strategies-single sourcing and <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> strategies. The study focuses on how the strategies are adopted and reasons for adopting one over the other. Besides, this study also looks at hte purchasing corporate planning strategy. There are two distinguishing strategies that can be discerned from the literature. One is the traditional approach whereby buyers use multiple sources for their material supply and the other on partnership approach shere buyers establish a cooperative relationship with a single source of supply. The study uses mail questionnaire survey to obtain te desired data concentrated among 42 manufacturing firms in Senai and Tebrau industrial areas. The results form the analysis indicated that the respondents select their suppliers based on competitive bidding and the majority of them apply both single and <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing.</b> Whether the manufacturing firms chose single sourcing or <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> strategies, the most important things between that manufacturing firm and their suppiers are good relationship, cooperation and understanding each other...|$|E
40|$|The {{advantage}} of <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> {{to protect against}} supplier failures arising from undependable products due to latent defects is examined using a model with non-linear external failure costs. Prior research has focused only on supplier failures arising from unreliable supply, such as late/insufficient/no delivery. I derive a closed-form characterization of the optimal production quota allocation for the LUX (Latent defect-Undependable product-eXternal failure) setting. The allocation determines the optimal supply base, with intuitive properties that hold under a mild condition. The condition includes the special case of equal procurement costs charged by suppliers but also allows unequal costs without any particular order. Necessary and sufficient conditions are also derived to determine (i) the exact size of the optimal supply base, provided the mild condition holds, and (ii) whether single or <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> is optimal, without requiring any precondition. ...|$|E
