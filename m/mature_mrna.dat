This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' {{central role in}} protein translation. Mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.|$|E
5|$|The {{transcribed}} pre-mRNA contains untranslated regions at {{both ends}} which contain a ribosome binding site, terminator and start and stop codons. In addition, most eukaryotic open reading frames contain untranslated introns which are removed before the exons are translated.

5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries {{information}} about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is coded so that every three nucleotides (a codon) corresponds to one amino acid. In eukaryotic cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to <b>mature</b> <b>mRNA.</b> This removes its introns—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form {{with the help of}} tRNA. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After {{a certain amount of time}} the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of ribonucleases.|$|E

In this study, we analyzed by Northern blotting with a panel of probes the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions derived from several rodent cell lines. For most of the genes under study, <b>mature</b> <b>mRNAs</b> could easily be detected in the nuclear fraction and accumulated to higher levels than the corresponding precursors. In addition, significant differences in the nucleo-cytoplasmic partition of <b>mature</b> <b>mRNAs</b> were observed between genes as well as between cell types (NIH 3 T 3, CTLL- 2, D 3 -ES, PC- 12), indicating that this nuclear accumulation of mRNA is regulated.

5|$|Transcription is {{the process}} by which the {{information}} contained in a section of DNA is replicated {{in the form of a}} newly assembled piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). Enzymes facilitating the process include RNA polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryotic cells the primary transcript is pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA must be processed for translation to proceed. Processing includes the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail to the pre-mRNA chain, followed by splicing. Alternative splicing occurs when appropriate, increasing the diversity of the proteins that any single mRNA can produce. The product of the entire transcription process (that began with the production of the pre-mRNA chain) is a <b>mature</b> <b>mRNA</b> chain.|$|E
5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} organisms, pre-mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus, introns are spliced out, {{then the}} <b>mature</b> <b>mRNA</b> is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The small subunit of the ribosome usually starts by binding to {{one end of}} the mRNA and is joined there by various other eukaryotic initiation factors, forming the initiation complex. The initiation complex scans along the mRNA strand until it reaches a start codon, and then the large subunit of the ribosome attaches to the small subunit and translation of a protein begins. This entire process is referred to as gene expression; it is the process by which the information in a gene, encoded as a sequence of bases in DNA, is converted into the structure of a protein. A Morpholino can modify splicing or block translation, depending on the Morpholino's base sequence.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a strand of pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the <b>mature</b> <b>mRNA.</b> Targeting some splice targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. Splice modification can be conveniently assayed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and {{is seen as a}} band shift after gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products.|$|E

5|$|Translation is {{the process}} by which a <b>mature</b> <b>mRNA</b> {{molecule}} is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein. Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds. The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus. During and after synthesis, most new proteins must fold to their active three-dimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{assembled}} from {{amino acids}} using information encoded in genes. Each protein {{has its own}} unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code {{is a set of}} three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (also known as a primary transcript) using various forms of Post-transcriptional modification to form the <b>mature</b> <b>mRNA,</b> which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.|$|E
25|$|While {{transcription}} of prokaryotic protein-coding genes creates messenger RNA (mRNA) that {{is ready}} for translation into protein, transcription of eukaryotic genes leaves a primary transcript of RNA (pre-mRNA), which first has to undergo a series of modifications to become a <b>mature</b> <b>mRNA.</b>|$|E
40|$|Intron-containing pre-mRNAs are {{normally}} {{retained in the}} nucleus until they are spliced to produce <b>mature</b> <b>mRNAs</b> that are exported to the cytoplasm. Although the detailed mechanism is not well understood, the formation of splicing-related complexes on pre-mRNAs {{is thought to be}} responsible for the nuclear retention. Therefore, pre-mRNAs containing suboptimal splice sites should tend to leak out to the cytoplasm. Such pre-mRNAs often contain purine-rich exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) that stimulate splicing of the adjacent intron. Here, we show that ESEs per se possess an activity to retain RNAs in the nucleus through a saturable nuclear retention factor. Cross-competition experiments revealed that intron-containing pre-mRNAs (without ESEs) used the same saturable nuclear retention factor as ESEs. Interestingly, although intronless mRNAs containing ESEs were also poorly exported, spliced mRNAs produced from ESE-containing pre-mRNAs were efficiently exported to the cytoplasm. Thus, the splicing reaction can reset the nuclear retention state caused by ESEs, allowing nuclear export of <b>mature</b> <b>mRNAs.</b> Our results reveal a novel aspect of ESE activity that should contribute to gene expression and RNA quality control...|$|R

Along the maturation process, the mRNA transcript is scrutinized by quality control machinery at numerous steps. The extensive RNA surveillance ensures that only correctly processed <b>mature</b> <b>mRNAs</b> are translated and precludes production of aberrant transcripts that could encode mutant or possible deleterious proteins.

50|$|Another {{difference}} between eukaryotes and prokaryotes is mRNA transport. Because eukaryotic transcription and translation is compartmentally separated, eukaryotic mRNAs must be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm—a process {{that may be}} regulated by different signaling pathways. <b>Mature</b> <b>mRNAs</b> are recognized by their processed modifications and then exported through the nuclear pore by binding to the cap-binding proteins CBP20 and CBP80, {{as well as the}} transcription/export complex (TREX).

25|$|A very {{important}} modification of eukaryotic pre-mRNA is RNA splicing. The majority of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs consist of alternating segments called exons and introns. During {{the process of}} splicing, an RNA-protein catalytical complex known as spliceosome catalyzes two transesterification reactions, which remove an intron and release it in form of lariat structure, and then splice neighbouring exons together. In certain cases, some introns or exons can be either removed or retained in <b>mature</b> <b>mRNA.</b> This so-called alternative splicing creates series of different transcripts originating from a single gene. Because these transcripts can be potentially translated into different proteins, splicing extends the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression.|$|E
40|$|In higher eukaryotes, the {{regulation}} of pre-mRNA processing is still poorly known. The accumulation of various <b>mature</b> <b>mRNAs,</b> which {{can be observed in}} the nuclei of mammalian cells, is suggestive of a regulatory role of transport. However, the significance of these nuclear mRNA is presently unknown. We have used a tetracycline-regulated promoter to investigate the dynamics of these pools of mRNAs upon arrest of transcription. We observed, for beta-globin and LT-alpha genes, a slow disappearance of these mRNA from the nucleus, with an apparent half-life that is similar to their cytoplasmic half-life. In view of these dynamics, these mRNA cannot simply be <b>mature</b> <b>mRNAs</b> in transit to the cytoplasm. They could be mRNAs retained in the nucleus, provided that {{the regulation}} of mRNA stability is comparable in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. But, because of their limited stability, these nuclear mRNAs cannot constitute a significant stock for gene expression.
