500|$|In May 1948, Rodgers {{received}} {{a telephone call}} from Edwin Lester of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera. [...] Lester had signed former Metropolitan Opera star Ezio Pinza for $25,000 to star in a new show, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ambassador.</b> [...] The show had not been written, and it never would be. [...] Lester hoped that Rodgers would take over Pinza's contract. [...] Pinza had become bored as the Met's leading lyric bass, and having played the great opera houses, sought other worlds to conquer. [...] Rodgers immediately saw Pinza as perfect for the role of Emile. [...] Lester carefully broached the subject to Pinza and his wife/business manager and provided them with a copy of Tales of the South Pacific. [...] When Pinza read the book, he told Lester, [...] "Sell me right away!" [...] Pinza's contract for South Pacific included a clause limiting his singing to 15 minutes per performance. [...] With Pinza's signing, Rodgers and Hammerstein decided to make his the lead male role, subordinating the story of the pair of young lovers. [...] It was unusual on Broadway for the romantic lead to be an older male.|$|E
