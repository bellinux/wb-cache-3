5|$|The {{relative}} {{reactivity of}} zinc {{and its ability}} to attract oxidation to itself <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.|$|E

Phthalazine derivatives have applications as therapeutic agents, chemiluminescent materials, ligands in transition metal catalysis, and as optical materials. Some time ago, our research group developed a methodology for the preparation of phthalazine derivatives in three steps, affording halo-thienyl-phthalazine derivatives that {{play an important role}} in diazine chemistry since they offer great potential for further functionalization by nucleophilic displacement of the halogen, making numerous otherwise inaccessible diazines become available. In continuation of the work developed before by our research group, we report in this communication the synthesis and the evaluation of the optical properties of two novel thienyl-phthalazine derivatives, having in mind further functionalization to prepare push-pull heterocyclic systems for several optical and photovoltaic applications. These studies showed that the optical properties could be readily tuned by varying the π-conjugation path length through the introduction of a second thiophene unit.

5|$|Despite the {{experimental}} {{support for this}} hypothesis, it remains controversial. A common critique is that devoutness is easy to fake, such as simply by attending a religious service. However, the hypothesis predicts that {{people are more likely}} to join and contribute to a religious group when its rituals are costly. Another critique specifically asks: why religion? There is no evolutionary advantage to evolving religion over other signals of commitment such as nationality, as Irons admits. However, the reinforcement of religious rites as well as the intrinsic reward and punishment system found in religion <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> ideal candidate for increasing intragroup cooperation. Finally, there is insufficient evidence for increase in fitness as a result of religious cooperation. However, Sosis argues for benefits from religion itself, such as increased longevity, improved health, assistance during crises, and greater psychological well being though both the supposed benefits from religion and the costly-signaling mechanism have been contested.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} a {{shielding}} gas depends on several factors, most importantly the type of material being welded and the process variation being used. Pure inert gases such as argon and helium are only used for nonferrous welding; with steel they do not provide adequate weld penetration (argon) or cause an erratic arc and encourage spatter (with helium). Pure carbon dioxide, on the other hand, allows for deep penetration welds but encourages oxide formation, which adversely affect the mechanical properties of the weld. lts low cost <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> attractive choice, {{but because of the}} reactivity of the arc plasma, spatter is unavoidable and welding thin materials is difficult. As a result, argon and carbon dioxide are frequently mixed in a 75%/25% to 90%/10% mixture. Generally, in short circuit GMAW, higher carbon dioxide content increases the weld heat and energy when all other weld parameters (volts, current, electrode type and diameter) are held the same. As the carbon dioxide content increases over 20%, spray transfer GMAW becomes increasingly problematic, especially with smaller electrode diameters.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men torch fish. Torch fishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch fishing season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the fishing season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> honest costly signal.|$|E
