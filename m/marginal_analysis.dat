25|$|In economics, {{marginal}} cost {{is the change}} in the opportunity cost that arises when the quantity produced is incremented by one unit, that is, it is the cost of producing one more unit of a good. Intuitively, {{marginal cost}} at each level of production includes the cost of any additional inputs required to produce the next unit. At each level of production and time period being considered, marginal costs include all costs that vary with the level of production, whereas other costs that do not vary with production are considered fixed. For example, the marginal cost of producing an automobile will generally include the costs of labor and parts needed for the additional automobile and not the fixed costs of the factory that have already been incurred. In practice, <b>marginal</b> <b>analysis</b> is segregated into short and long-run cases, so that, over the long run, all costs (including fixed costs) become marginal.|$|E

500|$|One {{criticism}} to the UCS {{study is}} that the analysis was made using average emissions rates across regions instead of marginal generation {{at different times of}} the day. The former approach {{does not take into account}} the generation mix within interconnected electricity markets and shifting load profiles throughout the day. An analysis by three economist affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), published in November 2014, developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the United States. The <b>marginal</b> <b>analysis,</b> applied to plug-in electric vehicles, found that the emissions of charging PEVs vary by region and hours of the day. In some regions, such as the Western U.S. and Texas, [...] emissions per mile from driving PEVs are less than those from driving a hybrid car. However, in other regions, such as the Upper Midwest, charging during the recommended hours of midnight to 4 a.m. implies that PEVs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road. The results show a fundamental tension between electricity load management and environmental goals as the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions. This occurs because coal-fired units, which have higher emission rates, are most commonly used to meet base-level and off-peak electricity demand; while natural gas units, which have relatively low emissions rates, are often brought online to meet peak demand.|$|E

60|$|Among {{the works}} {{read in the}} course of this year, which contributed {{materially}} to my development, I owe it to mention a book (written on the foundation of some of Bentham's manuscripts and published under the pseudonyme of Philip Beauchamp) entitled Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the Temporal Happiness of Mankind. This was an examination not of the truth, but of the usefulness of religious belief, in the most general sense, apart from the peculiarities of any special revelation; which, of all the parts of the discussion concerning religion, is the most important in this age, in which real belief in any religious doctrine is feeble and precarious, but the opinion of its necessity for moral and social purposes almost universal; and when those who reject revelation, very generally take refuge in an optimistic Deism, a worship of the order of Nature, and the supposed course of Providence, at least as full of contradictions, and perverting to the moral sentiments, as any of the forms of Christianity, if only it is as completely realized. Yet very little, with any claim to a philosophical character, has been written by sceptics against the usefulness of this form of belief. The volume bearing the name of Philip Beauchamp had this for its special object. Having been shown to my father in manuscript, it was put into my hands by him, and I made a <b>marginal</b> <b>analysis</b> of it as I had done of the Elements of Political Economy. Next to the Traité de Législation, it was one of the books which by the searching character of its analysis produced the greatest effect upon me. On reading it lately after an interval of many years, I find it to have some of the defects as well as the merits of the Benthamic modes of thought, and to contain, as I now think, many weak arguments, but with a great overbalance of sound ones, and much good material for a more completely philosophic and conclusive treatment of the subject.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Dimensionality {{reduction}} algorithms, which aim {{to select}} a small set of efficient and discriminant features, have attracted great attention for human gait recognition and content-based image retrieval (CBIR). In this paper, we present extensions of our recently proposed <b>marginal</b> Fisher <b>analysis</b> (MFA) to address these problems. For human gait recognition, we first present a direct application of MFA, then inspired by recent advances in matrix and tensor-based dimensionality reduction algorithms, we present matrix-based MFA for directly handling 2 -D input {{in the form of}} gray-level averaged images. For CBIR, we deal with the relevance feedback problem by extending MFA to <b>marginal</b> biased <b>analysis,</b> in which within-class compactness is characterized only by the distances between each positive sample and its neighboring positive samples. In addition, we present a new technique to acquire a direct optimal solution for MFA without resorting to objective function modification as done in many previous algorithms. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the USF HumanID gait database and the Corel image retrieval database. Experimental results demonstrate that MFA and its extensions outperform related algorithms in both applications.
