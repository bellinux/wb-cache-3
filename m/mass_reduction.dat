25|$|To give {{an idea of}} {{the scale}} of the problem, {{assuming}} a solar panel mass of 20kg per kilowatt (without considering the mass of the supporting structure, antenna, or any significant <b>mass</b> <b>reduction</b> of any focusing mirrors) a 4 GW power station would weigh about 80,000 metric tons, all of which would, in current circumstances, be launched from the Earth. Very lightweight designs could likely achieve 1kg/kW, meaning 4,000 metric tons for the solar panels for the same 4 GW capacity station. This would be the equivalent of between 40 and 150 heavy-lift launch vehicle (HLLV) launches to send the material to low earth orbit, where it would likely be converted into subassembly solar arrays, which then could use high-efficiency ion-engine style rockets to (slowly) reach GEO (Geostationary orbit). With an estimated serial launch cost for shuttle-based HLLVs of $500 million to $800 million, and launch costs for alternative HLLVs at $78 million, total launch costs would range between $11 billion (low cost HLLV, low weight panels) and $320 billion ('expensive' HLLV, heavier panels). To these costs must be added the environmental impact of heavy space launch emissions, if such costs are to be used in comparison to earth-based energy production. For comparison, the direct cost of a new coal or nuclear power plant ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion per GW (not including the full cost to the environment from CO2 emissions or storage of spent nuclear fuel, respectively); another example is the Apollo missions to the Moon cost a grand total of $24 billion (1970s' dollars), taking inflation into account, would cost $140 billion today, more expensive than the construction of the International Space Station.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the {{phosphorus}} (P) removal mechanisms associated with constructed wetlands, the sustainability of P treatment is usually of high interest. As a result, a 4 -year dataset from a typical multi-celled integrated constructed wetland (ICW) located at Glaslough in Co. Monaghan, Ireland was evaluated to determine the effects of long-term P loadings and hydrological inputs on P treatment. The ICW was intensively monitored year-round from February 2008 through March 2012 for total P and molybdate reactive phosphate (MRP). Domestic wastewater was loaded at 16. 4 [*]±[*] 0. 96 g m(2) year(- 1) for total P and 11. 2 [*]±[*] 0. 74 g m(2) year(- 1) for MRP. Average <b>mass</b> <b>reductions</b> over the monitoring period were 91. 4 and 90. 1 %, respectively. The area-based kinetic coefficients (K(20)) of 11. 8 for total P and 15. 6 m year(- 1) for MRP indicated a high area-specific retention rate. The ICW appeared to have a sustained capacity for P adsorption and retention, but the treatment was influenced mainly by external hydrological inputs and fluctuations in wastewater loadings. Linear regression analyses showed a <b>reduction</b> in <b>mass</b> retention of both total P and MRP with increased effluent flow volumes.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve energy capture and {{reduce the cost of}} wind energy, {{in the past few decades}} wind {{turbines}} have grown significantly larger. As their blades get longer, the design of the inboard region (near the blade root) becomes a trade-off between competing structural and aerodynamic requirements. State-of-the-art blades require thick airfoils near the root to efficiently support large loads inboard, but those thick airfoils have inherently poor aerodynamic performance. New designs are required to circumvent this design compromise. One such design is the "biplane blade", in which the thick airfoils in the inboard region are replaced with thinner airfoils in a biplane configuration. This design was shown previously to have significantly increased structural performance over conventional blades. In addition, the biplane airfoils can provide increased lift and aerodynamic efficiency compared to thick monoplane inboard airfoils, indicating a potential for increased power extraction. This work investigates the fundamental aerodynamic aspects, aerodynamic design and performance, and optimal structural design of the biplane blade. First, the two-dimensional aerodynamics of biplanes with relatively thick airfoils are investigated, showing unique phenomena which arise as a result of airfoil thickness. Next, the aerodynamic design of the full biplane blade is considered. Two biplane blades are designed for optimal aerodynamic loading, and their aerodynamic performance quantified. Considering blades with practical chord distributions and including the drag of the mid-blade joint, it is shown that biplane blades have comparable power output to conventional monoplane designs. The results of this analysis also show that the biplane blades can be designed with significantly less chord than conventional designs, a characteristic which enables larger blade designs. The aerodynamic loads on the biplane blades are shown to be increased in gust conditions and decreased under extreme conditions. Finally, considering these aerodynamic loads, the blade <b>mass</b> <b>reductions</b> achievable by biplane blades are quantified. The internal structure of the biplane blades are designed using a multi-disciplinary optimization which seeks to minimize mass, subject to constraints which represent realistic design requirements. Using this approach, it is shown that biplane blades can be built more than 45 % lighter than a similarly-optimized conventional blade; the reasons for these <b>mass</b> <b>reductions</b> are examined in detail. As blade length is increased, these <b>mass</b> <b>reductions</b> are shown to be even more significant. These large <b>mass</b> <b>reductions</b> are indicative of significant cost of electricity reductions from rotors fitted with biplane blades. Taken together, these results show that biplane blades are a concept which can enable the next generation of larger wind turbine rotors...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report in a study {{examining}} the impact of launch vehicles for various boost propulsion design options. These options included: differing boost phase engines using different combinations of fuels and coolants to include RP- 1, methane, propane (subcooled and normal boiling point), and hydrogen; variable and high mixture ratio hydrogen engines; translating nozzles on boost phase engines; and cross feeding propellants from the booster to second stage. Vehicles examined included a fully reusable two stage cargo vehicle and a single stage to orbit vehicle. The use of subcooled propane as a fuel generated vehicles with the lowest total vehicle dry mass. Engines with hydrogen cooling generated only slight <b>mass</b> <b>reductions</b> from the reference, all-hydrogen vehicle. Cross feeding propellants generated the most significant <b>mass</b> <b>reductions</b> from the reference two stage vehicle. The use of high mixture ratio or variable mixture ratio hydrogen engines in the boost phase of flight resulted in vehicles with total dry mass 20 percent greater than the reference hydrogen vehicle. Translating nozzles for boost phase engines generated a heavier vehicle. Also examined were the design impacts on the vehicle and ground support subsystems when subcooled propane {{is used as a}} fuel. The most significant cost difference between facilities to handle normal boiling point versus subcooled propane is 5 million dollars. Vehicle cost differences were negligible.
