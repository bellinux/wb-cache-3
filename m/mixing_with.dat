5|$|Based on its composition, it {{is assumed}} that the magma at Licancabur formed from the partial melting of the oceanic crust subducted at the Peru-Chile Trench after metamorphosis. This magma melted part of the mantle wedge above the subducting plate, <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> the melt products. Further {{contamination}} by crustal Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite-like rocks from the Archean, crystal fractionation and magma mixing further up in the crust then yielded the Licancabur magmas. The younger lavas may have formed from the mixing of dacite with the magmas forming the older lavas. Some inclusions in Licancabur rocks seem to be from wall rocks of the magma chamber.|$|E

Neil stated they brought to artists and DJ's working prototypes {{of the game}} and hardware to show them what the sampled music and final mixes sounded like, garnering interest from these groups.

5|$|Birds roam {{from the}} forest floor to the canopy, but {{particularly}} favour the middle story. They mostly operate alone, in pairs or groups of three, and {{can also be found}} <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> long-billed bernierias. Larger flocks do not occur. The nelicourvi weaver is an agile, active species that generally makes a lot of noise. It searches for insects on leaves, and branches, while hanging from vines and twigs. It looks for animals in rolled leaves such as wild ginger Aframomum and along leaf litter, probing crevices, and opening dead stems. It also dismembers flowers to reach the nectar. Mostly, arthropods (beetles, bugs, butterflies, caterpillars, dragonflies, flies, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, stick insects, millipedes and spiders) are consumed, sometimes small vertebrates (lizards and chameleons), next to some nectar, fruit and probably seeds.|$|E
5|$|Chavundaraya II, a Shaiva Brahmin (Brahmin {{devotee of}} the god Shiva) by faith and a protege of King Jayasimha II, wrote Lokopakara (c.1025) in the champu metre.

The work is on various topics such as daily life, astronomy, astrology and forecasting of events based on the Indian calendar (panchanga phala), sculpture, construction of buildings (vastu vichara) and reservoirs (udakargala), omens, divination of water, preparation of medicine from herbs and plants (vrikshayurveda), general medicine (vaidya), perfumery, cookery and toxicology (vishavaidya).

5|$|The {{bombing was}} planned and {{performed}} by two Vietcong agents who escaped uninjured and were never captured. Nguyen Thanh Xuan recollected his involvement to historian Stanley Karnow {{after the war}} had ended. In late-November, Xuan and his comrade received orders from a Vietcong intermediary to bomb the Brinks Hotel. The building housed United States Army officers, including lieutenant colonels and majors, and attracted off-duty personnel with its highly regarded food and drink, rooftop seating areas and movie screenings. It was a six-story building and had 193bedrooms. The Vietcong duo observed their target over the next month, <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> the crowds in the busy street outside. Noting that South Vietnamese officers mingled freely with Americans, they obtained ARVN uniforms from Saigon's black market, enabling them to get closer. Xuan disguised himself as a military chauffeur, while his partner dressed as a South Vietnamese major. They mingled with the real officers {{so that they could}} copy their mannerisms, speaking style and even their way of smoking. The Vietcong pair then procured the two cars and explosives needed for the operation.|$|E

5|$|The {{water pipit}} {{is closely related}} to the Eurasian rock pipit and the meadow pipit, and is rather similar to both in appearance. Compared to the meadow pipit, the water pipit is longer-winged and longer-tailed than its relative, and has much paler underparts. It has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian rock pipit, but has a strong supercilium, greyer upperparts, and white, not grey, outer tail feathers; it is also {{typically}} much warier. The habitats used by Eurasian rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting. There is also little <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> breeding meadow pipits, although since 1960 some overlapping territories have been found where the species coexist.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the dozens}} of extant wasp families, only the family Vespidae {{contains}} social species, primarily in the subfamilies Vespinae and Polistinae. With their powerful stings and conspicuous warning coloration, often in black and yellow, social wasps are frequent models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects, and are themselves involved in mutually beneficial Müllerian mimicry of other distasteful insects including bees and other wasps. All species of social wasps construct their nests using some form of plant fiber (mostly wood pulp) as the primary material, though this can be supplemented with mud, plant secretions (e.g., resin), and secretions from the wasps themselves; multiple fibrous brood cells are constructed, arranged in a honeycombed pattern, and often surrounded by a larger protective envelope. Wood fibers are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> saliva. The placement of nests varies from group to group; yellow jackets such as D. media and D. sylvestris prefer to nest in trees and shrubs; P. exigua attaches its nests {{on the underside of}} leaves and branches; Polistes erythrocephalus chooses sites close to a water source. Other wasps, like A. multipicta and V. germanica, like to nest in cavities that include holes in the ground, spaces under homes, wall cavities or in lofts. While most species of wasps have nests with multiple combs, some species, such as Apoica flavissima, only have one comb. The length of the reproductive cycle depends on latitude; Polistes erythrocephalus, for example, has a much longer (up to 3 months longer) cycle in temperate regions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{deals with}} the effect of {{salinity}} of groundwater on some properties of clayey soil. Properties obtained from tests carried out on samples <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> water containing different salt contents are compared with those obtained from tests carried out on samples <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> pure water (tap water). The tested samples {{were taken from the}} site of the Faculty of Engineering in Qena, South Valley University. Two sets of samples of the clay soil were tested. One was <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> pure water (pure water clay soil) and the other was <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> salty water added to it in ratios ranging from 20 % to 80 % (clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> salt). The test results showed the effect of groundwater salinity on the tested samples. The plasticity index decreased from 26 for pure water clay soil to 24. 96 for clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> 80 % salt. The coefficient of consolidation increased from 0. 00196 for pure water clay soil to 0. 002744 for clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> 80 % salt. The California bearing ratio increased from 9. 75 % for pure water clay soil to 10. 15 % for clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> 80 % salt. The optimum moisture content increased from 14. 25 % for pure water clay soil to 16. 5 % for clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> 100 % salt. Decrease in the maximum dry density is observed for clay soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> salty when compared with pure water clay soil. A marked decrease was noticed for the value of the unconfined compressive strength.

40|$|The {{strength}} of the cement-stabilized soil can be improved {{by the use of}} seawater. Compressive strength test results show that the {{strength of}} cement-stabilized soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> seawater is 50 % greater than that <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> freshwater at the 90 th day. However, the application is limited because the expansion of the cement-stabilized soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> seawater increases significantly. A kind of ultrafine silica fume was added into the cement-stabilized soil to inhibit swelling of the cement-stabilized soil with seawater. The expansion of cement-stabilized soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> seawater by adding ultrafine silica fume is close to that of cement-stabilized soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> freshwater. With the addition of ultrafine silica fume, the unconfined compressive strength increases by close to 6. 5 % compared with seawater alone at the 90 th day. The mechanisms of adding ultrafine silica fume into the cement-stabilized soil <b>mixed</b> <b>with</b> seawater are revealed by several physical and chemical characterization parameters, such as specific gravity, unbound water content, surface morphology seen with SEM, and crystal products by X-ray diffraction tests.
