50|$|Nitrogen {{nutrition}} {{is another}} factor that affects the yield of Cicer arietinum, although the application itself differs from other perennial crops {{with regards to the}} levels administered on the plant. High doses of nitrogen inhibit the yield of the chickpea plant. Drought stress is a likely factor that also inhibits the uptake of nitrogen and subsequent fixation in the roots of Cicer arietinum. The growth of the perennial chickpea is dependent on the balance between nitrogen fixation and assimilation that is also characteristic of many other agricultural plant types. The influence of drought stress, sowing date, and <b>mineral</b> <b>nitrogen</b> supply all {{have an effect on the}} yield and size of the plant, with trials showing that Cicer arietinum differed from other plant species in its capacity to assimilate <b>mineral</b> <b>nitrogen</b> supply from soil during drought stress. Additional minerals and micronutrients make the absorption process of nitrogen and phosphorus more available. Inorganic phosphate ions are generally attracted towards charged minerals such as iron and aluminium oxides.|$|E

50|$|Whether {{nitrogen}} is mineralized or immobilized {{depends on}} the Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) ratio of the plant residues. In general plant residues entering the soil have too little nitrogen to support the biosynthetic needs of the soil microbial population (decomposers).

50|$|Sheep's fescue is a drought-resistant grass, {{commonly}} found on poor, well-drained mineral soil. It is sometimes {{used as a}} drought-tolerant lawn grass. The great ability to adapt to poor soils is due to mycorrhizal fungi, which increase the absorption of water and nutrients and also are potential determinants of plant community structure. The symbiosis with fungi increases <b>mineral,</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and phosphate absorption, thanks to fungal hyphae that expand deeply in the soil and cover plant roots, increasing the exchange surface.

50|$|However, {{insecticide}} is not {{its only}} use. Tephrosia vogelii can also increase various nutrients {{in the soil}} and is often used in intercropping. Studies have shown a 30% increase in soil nutrients, and as a result, a 23-26% greater crop yield. Tephrosia treatments increased organic carbon and <b>mineral</b> <b>nitrogen</b> in the soil. The experiment that discovered this used pots with various concentration of Tephrosia vogelii to be grown along with corn. The pots that contained Tephrosia showed a large increase in nitrogen and carbon. To determine this, researchers used weeds and insects to measure nitrogen and potassium content of the soil, respectively. Therefore, a well designed intercropping system could dramatically increase crop production in arid land. Normally, if crops are grown together, there is less yield then if they were grown alone. This shows that Tephrosia vogelii has a synergistic effect with multiple crops including coffee and corn. Increased nutrients are yet another way Tephrosia vogelii can improve the yield of other crops. Tephrosia might not grow well alone, {{but if it is}} grown along with another crop, it can grow up to 6 times more than it would alone. Its poor growth is often due to the high acidity of the soil, as well as low calcium, low sodium, and low potassium.|$|E
