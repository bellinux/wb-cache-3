25|$|The PT92 can be {{distinguished}} from its modern Beretta counterpart primarily by having the safety <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> as opposed to on the slide like the Beretta. Though mechanically similar to the original, the PT92s differ from the early 92s by having a trigger guard similar to the modern 92s (the originals were rounded) and a magazine release {{in the same place}} as the modern 92s (the originals were {{at the bottom of the}} grip).|$|E
25|$|Catarafts are {{constructed}} {{from the same}} materials as rafts. They can either be paddled or rowed with oars. Typical catarafts {{are constructed}} from two inflatable pontoons {{on either side of}} the craft that are bridged by a frame. Oar-propelled catarafts have the occupants sitting on seats <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> Virtually all oar-powered catarafts are operated by a boatsman with passengers having no direct responsibilities. Catarafts can be of all sizes; many are smaller and more maneuverable than a typical raft.|$|E
2500|$|That {{measurement}} is then {{amplified by}} electronic amplifiers attached {{to parts of}} an electronic negative feedback loop. [...] One of the amplified currents from the negative feedback loop drives a coil very like a loudspeaker, except that the coil {{is attached to the}} mass, and the magnet is <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> The result is that the mass stays nearly motionless.|$|E
50|$|A {{bellcrank}} whose center pivot was <b>the</b> upper, forward <b>mount</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame,</b> {{and whose}} ends {{were attached to}} the top of the main link and the radius rod (the connection to the combination arm and thence to the valve).|$|R
50|$|During the {{following}} winter, Perkins created numerous small marine and landscape paintings which Staley framed. A few large paintings were also produced. Perkins also painted wooden cut outs of ducks and sea gulls {{which were then}} <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> of shore and marine paintings. The shop also included items created by Thomaston, Maine State Prison inmates. Staley's aunt, Dorothy Prescott provided embroidered and quilt items to supplement the store.|$|R
50|$|The OrCam MyEye {{consists}} of two main components: the head unit and the base unit. The head unit {{consists of}} a camera and a microphone, and is <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> {{of a pair of}} eyeglasses. The box-like base unit contains the algorithms and processing components that give the device its functionality, and can be clipped to a belt or left to rest in a pocket. The head unit and base unit are adjoined by a connecting cable.|$|R
2500|$|During the mid-1980s, Ruger {{began to}} have reports of {{failures}} in the Redhawk revolvers. [...] Some Redhawks were reported to be separating at the junction between barrel and frame. [...] It was not known at the time why this was happening; the Redhawk {{had been on the}} market for years with no reported problems, but Ruger decided to address the issue by extending the frame 2.5inches past the cylinder face, {{all the way to the}} end of the ejector rod, to provide a massive surface into which to thread the barrel. [...] The extended frame also provided enough length to allow scope bases to be <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame,</b> rather than on the barrel as was done on the scoped versions of the Redhawk. [...] It was determined that the barrel separations on the Redhawks were due to a change in the lubricant used when attaching the barrels to the frames, but by that time the new Super Redhawk design was already well underway and the extended frame was kept.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>frame</b> is {{a single}} tube {{following}} the circumference of the front wheel, then diverting to a trailing wheel. A mounting peg is above the rear wheel. The front wheel is in a rigid fork with little if any trail. A spoon brake is usually fitted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fork crown, operated by a lever {{from one of the}} handlebars. The bars are usually mustache shaped, dropping from the level of the headset. <b>The</b> saddle <b>mounts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> less than 50cm (18in) behind the headset.|$|R
50|$|A 0-4-0T {{built by}} Sir Arthur Heywood in 1896 for the Duke of Westminster's Eaton Hall Railway. It came to Ravenglass in 1916 {{and left in}} 1919. Few {{photographs}} survive of it working in Cumbria, however {{the remains of the}} locomotive returned to the railway in 1982 after spells at Llewellyn's Miniature Railway, Southport and the Fairbourne Railway, Wales. In 1992, the R&ER Heritage Group formed, with an aim to restore the locomotive to original condition, a project which is now well underway, with <b>the</b> boiler <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{relatively}} simple, compact artificial hand, {{is described}} which includes hooks pivotally <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> first frame to move together and apart. <b>The</b> first <b>frame</b> is rotatably <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a second frame to enable "turning at the wrist" movement without limitation. <b>The</b> second <b>frame</b> is pivotally <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a third frame to permit 'flexing at the wrist' movement. A hook-driving motor is fixed to <b>the</b> second <b>frame</b> {{but has a}} shaft that drives a speed reducer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>frame</b> which, in turn, drives the hooks. A second motor <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second <b>frame,</b> turns a gear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>frame</b> to rotate <b>the</b> first <b>frame</b> and <b>the</b> hooks thereon. A third motor <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third <b>frame,</b> turns a gear on a second frame to pivot it...|$|R

5000|$|The Maicoletta had a fan-cooled single-cylinder {{piston port}} {{two-stroke}} engine, originally of either 174 cc or 247 cc. A 277 cc engine became available in 1957.

The engine and transmission were <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> and drove the rear wheel through an enclosed drive chain.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnetic}} lock {{is suitable for}} both in-swinging and out-swinging doors. Brackets (L bracket, LZ bracket, U bracket) are used to orient the armature for use with both applications. Filler plates are also used to provide a large, flat <b>mounting</b> area <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door <b>frame</b> when <b>the</b> electromagnet is larger than <b>the</b> available <b>mounting</b> space <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door <b>frame</b> due to <b>the</b> <b>frame's</b> geometry.|$|R

5000|$|The sandboxes, {{which were}} <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bogie <b>frames,</b> were {{ineffective}} and required much too complicated gearing {{due to the}} fact that the engine units pivoted.

50|$|Hadley's first {{reflecting}} quadrant was {{a simple}} device with a frame spanning a 45° arc. In the image at the right, from Hadley's article in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, {{you can see the}} nature of his design. A small sighting telescope was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> along one side. One large index mirror was mounted at the point of rotation of the index arm. A second, smaller horizon mirror was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> in the line of sight of the telescope. The horizon mirror allows the observer to see the image of the index mirror in one half of the view and to see a distant object in the other half. A shade was mounted at the vertex of the instrument to allow one to observe a bright object. The shade pivots to allow it {{to move out of the}} way for stellar observations.|$|E
50|$|Also {{called an}} O-lock, ring-lock or frame lock. This {{is a low}} {{security}} mechanism <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> that immobilizes the rear wheel by moving a steel bolt through the spokes to prevent motion. It uses a straight or circular bolt which extends from the housing. This type of lock is common in Scandinavia, the Netherlands, China, India and Japan.|$|E
50|$|That {{measurement}} is then {{amplified by}} electronic amplifiers attached {{to parts of}} an electronic negative feedback loop.

50|$|In an ICF BMBC Bogie, {{the brake}} {{cylinder}} is <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bogie <b>frame</b> itself. Traditionally, <b>the</b> ICF Bogies were conventional type i.e. the brake cylinder was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{body of the}} coach. However, in the later modification, the new bogies are being manufactured with the BMBC designs only. Even the old type bogies are being converted into BMBC Bogies. The BMBC bogie has many advantages over the conventional ICF bogie. The foremost being that, since the brake cylinder is <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bogie <b>frame</b> itself and is nearer to the brake beam, the brake application time is reduced. Moreover, a small brake cylinder is adequate for braking purpose. This also reduces the overall weight of the ICF bogie apart from the advantage of quick brake application.|$|R
50|$|Another type of {{crank sensor}} {{is used on}} {{bicycles}} to monitor {{the position of the}} crankset, usually for the cadence readout of a cyclocomputer. These are usually reed switches <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bicycle <b>frame</b> with a corresponding magnet attached to one of the pedal crankset arms.|$|R
5000|$|The Zigolo's [...] single-cylinder {{two-stroke}} engine is <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fuselage <b>frame</b> in pusher configuration below the wing trailing edge. Its propeller is driven through belt gearing, {{the top of}} the propeller disc in the gap between the ailerons. An optional electric engine is also available.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{since the}} coal bunker was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> {{instead of on}} the engine unit, the rear pivot {{bearings}} were subject to quite rapid wear since they carried a considerable additional vertical load compared to those on a purebred Garratt. As {{was the case with the}} Modified Fairlies, this resulted in increased frequency of maintenance and as a consequence, increased operating cost.|$|E
50|$|In {{the drawing}} to the right, the horizon element (B) {{could be a}} mirror or a prism. On the index arm, the index mirror (A) rotated with the arm. A {{sighting}} telescope was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> (C). The index did not use a vernier or other device at the scale (D). Smith called the instrument's index arm a label, {{in the manner of}} Elton for his mariner's quadrant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> {{under the}} right portion of the side cover housing is the mainspring, a heavy V-spring. Its greater arm (lower) engages a notch in the right fork of the hammer to drive it forward when {{released}} by the sear. Its lesser arm (upper) continuously presses a cam upward that engages a slot in the under surface of the breechblock slide when the action is closed.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{capability}} {{that the}} interchangeable top end groups provide is the different slide/barrel lengths. The shorter [...] "Compact" [...] top end can be <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Standard <b>frame,</b> and vice versa. Thus, <b>the</b> most versatile <b>frame</b> is <b>the</b> Compact, {{which can be}} used with all lengths of slide as well as both Compact and Standard magazines.|$|R
50|$|The whole lower {{surface of}} the lifting-body was {{protected}} from the heat of re-entry by Toughened Unipiece Fibrous Insulation (TUFI) tiles, a tougher, more impact-resistant version of the Shuttle's HRSI tiles; the upgraded TUFI tiles came into use in 1996. These tiles, matt black like those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Shuttle, were bonded directly to a multi-piece titanium heat-resistant skin <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aluminium <b>frames.</b>|$|R

50|$|Originally the {{fairings}} were cowlings put {{around the}} front of the bike, increasing its frontal area. Gradually they became {{an integral part of the}} design. Modern fairings increase the frontal area at most by 5% compared to a naked machine. Fairings may carry headlights, instruments, and other items. If the fairing is <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame,</b> placing other equipment on the fairing reduces the weight and rotational inertia of the steering assembly, improving the handling.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to this rather serious defect, the pivot bearings were also subject to quite rapid wear since they carried a considerable additional load compared to those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Garratt {{as a result of}} the water and coal bunkers which were <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main <b>frame</b> instead of <b>on</b> <b>the</b> engine units. This resulted in increased frequency of maintenance and as a consequence, increased operating cost.|$|R
5000|$|The B′B′ or B-B {{arrangement}} is similar, but usually applies to diesel-hydraulic locomotives rather than diesel-electrics. <b>The</b> axles <b>on</b> each bogie are coupled together mechanically, {{rather than being}} driven by individual traction motors. Diesel-hydraulics have their engine <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main <b>frame</b> of <b>the</b> locomotive, together with a hydraulic transmission. Power is then transmitted to the bogies by cardan shafts and a short driveshaft between axles.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{front engine}} <b>mounts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> K75 <b>frame</b> are placed further back than in <b>the</b> K100 <b>frame</b> and <b>the</b> downtubes {{are at a}} {{different}} angle; otherwise <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> are identical. <b>The</b> K75 had the same wheelbase, seat height, and steering geometry as the K100. According to BMW, 80 percent of the K75's parts are interchangeable with the K100's. The K75's radiator and fuel tank were smaller than those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> K100.|$|R
