5|$|After the Act of Parliament {{had been}} granted, {{membership}} {{of the board of}} the LNWR changed, and they abandoned their support for the extension. By this time, the MR had bought <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> between Rickmansworth and Chesham required for that section of the route.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> in the {{watershed}} {{is owned by}} the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Bureau of Forestry, and Sproul State Forest. There are some agricultural lands in {{the watershed}}, most of which are in the vicinity of Huling Branch.|$|E
5|$|The {{estate was}} divided up {{and much of}} it sold in 1815, and {{remained}} in the hands of multiple private owners until <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> was purchased by the Coventry Corporation after the First World War and used for housing developments.|$|E
25|$|Tehuantepec gained {{municipal}} {{status in}} 1857 and town status in 1857. The Reform Laws secularized <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dominican {{order in the}} area.|$|R
50|$|Gurkhas {{lost control}} over Sikkim, <b>the</b> territories <b>of</b> Kumaon and Garhwal, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Terai; the British East India Company promised to pay 200,000 rupees {{annually}} {{to compensate for}} <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> income from <b>the</b> Terai region.|$|R
50|$|During this time, <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> Commission allotted <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> to <b>the</b> tenants. Major Aldridge {{bought the}} house and {{remaining}} lands in 1930. In 1931, <b>the</b> <b>land</b> in Attyshane was divided among the local people {{but there was still}} about 215 acre, including woodlands in the estate.|$|R
5|$|William Thomas Lyttleton, William Bryan and Sir Richard Dry {{were all}} {{important}} {{figures in the}} early days of the town. These three owned <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> of what is now the town and district of Hagley during the 1820s.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> in the Twomile Run {{watershed}} is {{used for}} recreation. Deer hunting and bear hunting are often done in the area. There is also a series all-terrain vehicle trails known collectively as the Whiskey Springs ATV trail complex.

5|$|The 'supposed' {{last night}} of the gardens was on 5 September 1839 when it {{attracted}} 1089 people. Vauxhall was sold at auction on 9 September 1841 for £20,000, following bankruptcy of the owners, after which it re-opened, but it was permanently closed in 1859, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> sold for building purposes.|$|E
50|$|Araladinni lies in <b>the</b> {{southern}} part <b>of</b> Vijapur district. its on <b>the</b> bank <b>of</b> Krishna River and has one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best fertile <b>land.</b> <b>The</b> <b>land</b> has {{black and red}} soil and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> are well irrigated. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farmers mainly grow sugar cane, maze, sunflower, wheet, jawar maze and many oil seeds.|$|R
50|$|As the Europeans {{continued}} to move west, they took <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{people who lived}} in the Rockies, forcing the Ute, Navajo, Hopi, Apache, Yaqui and other tribes to assimilate or move onto reservations. Some adapted to farming or sheep herding, but they are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> impoverished <b>of</b> all ethnic groups in the USA.|$|R
25|$|Eulogio lost <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hacienda when <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> Mexico rose {{up against}} the Porfirio Díaz regime and the Hacienda feudal system during the Mexican Revolution (1910-1921). These lands were divided among local peasant farmers in 1914. A number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hacienda's {{buildings}} were destroyed during the war, as well as furniture and administrative archives.|$|R
5|$|The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority {{was created}} {{after the storm}} to manage the area's {{floodplains}} and rivers, such as building dams. The heavily flooded areas were expropriated and barred from rebuilding homes, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> was later converted into an extensive park system along Toronto's rivers. A footbridge dedicated to the victims crosses the Humber river in Raymore Park, which was the former Raymore Drive.|$|E
5|$|The island's {{population}} was recorded as 192 at the 2011 census, {{an increase of}} over 30% since 2001. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. The majority of the resident working population are engaged in farming or fishing, and sheep raised on the island {{have a reputation for}} quality. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> is owned by the Duke of Argyll, with the farmers being tenants.|$|E
5|$|Chatteris is {{situated}} between Huntingdon, St Ives, Peterborough, March and Ely, {{in the middle}} of The Fens—the lowest-lying area in the United Kingdom—with <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> surrounding the town being below sea level, although the highest point in the Fens (36 feet above sea level) is within Chatteris's parish boundaries. The peaty land surrounding the town is largely used for agriculture, drained by numerous ditches and dykes, and there are two large drainage rivers near the town – the Forty Foot Drain, also known as Vermuyden's Drain, and the Sixteen Foot Drain.|$|E
5|$|The 1791 {{document}} {{remained in}} force {{for less than}} 19 months; after a brief war with Russia, it was annulled by the Grodno Sejm on 23 November 1793. By 1795, the Commonwealth was partitioned between Russian Empire, Kingdom of Prussia and Habsburg Austria, with <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand Duchy under the Russian rule.|$|R
25|$|The Three Leagues was <b>the</b> {{alliance}} <b>of</b> 1471 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> League <b>of</b> God's House, <b>the</b> League <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ten Jurisdictions and the Grey League, leading {{eventually to}} <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Swiss canton <b>of</b> Graubünden. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> <b>of</b> Graubünden were part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman province Raetia in 15 BC. The area later was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bishopric <b>of</b> Chur.|$|R
50|$|Following <b>the</b> {{partitions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Grand Duchy {{were directly}} annexed by the Russian Empire, the rest by Prussia. In 1812, just prior <b>the</b> French invasion <b>of</b> Russia, <b>the</b> former Grand Duchy revolted against the Russians. Soon {{after his arrival}} in Vilnius, Napoleon proclaimed <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> a Commissary Provisional Government <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand Duchy <b>of</b> Lithuania which, in turn, renewed the Polish-Lithuanian Union. The union was never formalized, however, as only half a year later Napoleon's Grande Armée was pushed out of Russia and forced to retreat further westwards. In December 1812, Vilnius was recaptured by Russian forces, bringing all plans <b>of</b> recreation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand Duchy to an end. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Grand Duchy were re-annexed by Russia. The Augustów Voivodeship (later Augustów Governorate), including <b>the</b> counties <b>of</b> Marijampolė and Kalvarija, was attached to <b>the</b> Kingdom <b>of</b> Poland, a rump state in personal union with Russia.|$|R
5|$|During {{the medieval}} period, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> {{was used for}} growing crops and raising {{livestock}} such as cattle. The produce from arable farming would have been sufficient to support the local population, but the cattle would have been sold to the ruling classes. Agriculture provided {{the main source of}} employment for Sale's residents until the mid-19th century. Industry was slow to develop in the area, as in most of what would become Trafford. This was partly because of the reluctance of the two main land owners in the area, the Stamfords and the de Traffords, to invest. Although weaving was common in Sale during the late 17th and early 18th century, by 1851 only 4% of the population was employed in that industry.|$|E
5|$|However, the Russian Army's {{transformation}} into a professional army was not deemed as successful. In September 2008, General Vladimir Boldyrev acknowledged {{that many of}} the professional soldiers did not have better training than the conscripts. Russian Airborne Troops and special forces conducted <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> fighting. Due to the Russian Air Force's inability to penetrate Georgian air defence, airborne troops could not be airlifted behind Georgian lines. An ambush of a ground-troop commander, in which only five of thirty vehicles in his convoy survived, indicated intelligence and surveillance negligence. Many Russian land units reportedly had an insufficient ammunition supply.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Crease {{presided over}} the trial of John Hall, who owned <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> on Burrard Inlet that now makes up the {{community}} of Belcarra, British Columbia, and {{who was accused of}} murdering his mother in law. Hall and Crease had known each other for years, and Crease had once employed him as his agent in a dispute with trespassers who illegally logged on land he and his friend Robert Burnaby owned near Hall's ranch. Hall was found guilty of manslaughter, and his land signed over to his attorney to pay for his defence.|$|E
25|$|Post-war {{development}} {{picked up}} considerably, and by 1960 <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> available <b>land</b> was already used.|$|R
2500|$|The river Saane/Sarine {{flows from}} the south to <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canton. Together with its tributaries it drains <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> in <b>the</b> canton, then joins the river Aare. The river Broye drains <b>the</b> west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canton and flows {{northeast}} into Lake Morat (Murtensee). <b>The</b> southwest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canton is drained by the river Veveyse, which flows south into Lake Geneva (...)

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Mainland, most of the islands are in two groups, the North and South Isles, {{all of which have}} an underlying geological base of Old Red Sandstone. The climate is mild and the soils are extremely fertile, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> being farmed. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy. The significant wind and marine energy resources are of growing importance, and the island generates more than its total yearly electricity demand using renewables. The local people are known as Orcadians and have a distinctive dialect of Scots and a rich inheritance of folklore. There is an abundance of marine and avian wildlife.|$|E
5|$|In postwar Poland, the {{government}} bought <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> where the camp had stood, {{and built a}} large stone memorial there between 1959 and 1962. In 1964 Treblinka was declared a national monument of Jewish martyrology in a ceremony {{at the site of}} the former gas chambers. In the same year the first German trials were held regarding war crimes committed at Treblinka by former SS members. After the end of communism in Poland in 1989, the number of visitors coming to Treblinka from abroad increased. An exhibition centre at the camp opened in 2006. It was later expanded and made into a branch of the Siedlce Regional Museum.|$|E
5|$|The valley narrows into {{a canyon}} {{as the road}} begins to climb again, closely hugging the north wall. Four miles (6.4km) east of the city, just past Targert Lake Road, it passes the gates where the road is closed in wintertime. Past this point {{development}} along the road abates as <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> alongside the road is part of White River National Forest. On {{the north side of}} the road are some of Aspen's more popular climbing cliffs; on the south side are many small parking areas for trailheads, campgrounds and popular swimming holes along the Roaring Fork like Devil's Punchbowl.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> Restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monarchy in 1660, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequestrated <b>land</b> was {{returned}} to the pre-war owners.|$|R
25|$|On February 18, 1861, six chiefs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern Cheyenne {{and four}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arapaho signed <b>the</b> Treaty <b>of</b> Fort Wise with the United States, {{in which they}} ceded <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> {{designated}} {{to them by the}} Fort Laramie treaty. The Cheyenne chiefs included Black Kettle, White Antelope (Vó'kaa'e Ohvó'komaestse), Lean Bear, Little Wolf, and Tall Bear; the Arapaho chiefs included Little Raven, Storm, Shave-Head, Big Mouth, and Niwot, or Left Hand.|$|R
25|$|The story sets in {{the distant}} future, when the Earth's oceans have risen and flooded <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea-lying <b>land</b> on Earth.|$|R
5|$|Yellowstone National Park spans {{an area of}} , {{comprising}} lakes, canyons, {{rivers and}} mountain ranges. Yellowstone Lake {{is one of the}} largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest supervolcano on the continent. The caldera is considered an active volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Half of the world's geothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone.|$|E
5|$|British rule in Nyasaland radically {{altered the}} local {{indigenous}} power structures. The early colonial period saw some immigration and settlement by white colonists, who bought large swathes of territory from local chiefs, often for token payments in beads or guns. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> acquired, {{particularly in the}} Shire Highlands, was converted into white-owned plantations where tea, coffee, cotton and tobacco were grown. The enforcement of colonial institutions, such as the Hut Tax, compelled many indigenous people to find paid work {{and the demand for}} labour created by the plantations, led to their becoming a major employer. Once employed on the plantations, black workers found that they were frequently beaten and subject to racial discrimination. Increasingly, the plantations were also forced to rely on a system of forced labour or corvée, known locally at the thangata.|$|E
5|$|By {{the year}} 737, Emperor Xuanzong {{discarded}} {{the policy of}} conscripting soldiers that were replaced every three years, replacing them with long-service soldiers who were more battle-hardened and efficient. It was more economically feasible as well, since training new recruits and sending {{them out to the}} frontier every three years drained the treasury. By the late 7th century, the fubing troops began abandoning military service and the homes provided to them in the equal-field system. The supposed standard of 100 mu of land allotted to each family was in fact decreasing in size in places where population expanded and the wealthy bought up <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land.</b> Hard-pressed peasants and vagrants were then induced into military service with benefits of exemption from both taxation and corvée labor service, as well as provisions for farmland and dwellings for dependents who accompanied soldiers on the frontier. By the year 742 the total number of enlisted troops in the Tang armies had risen to about 500,000 men.|$|E
25|$|Egerton became Governor of Lagos Colony, {{covering}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yoruba <b>lands</b> in <b>the</b> southwest <b>of</b> {{what is now}} Nigeria, in 1903.|$|R
50|$|British and Scottish media {{sometimes}} accorded their zamindar statuses as 'Princes'. After <b>the</b> War <b>of</b> 1971, {{they held}} considerable alliances with ruling presidents, military dictators and prime ministers, {{all the while}} refraining from elected public offices. The family still owns <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> as private estates, and taxes the inhabitants on produce from <b>the</b> <b>lands,</b> which in turn pays for upkeep <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> holdings, buildings etc. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residences used by the family lies mostly uninhabited, yet under <b>the</b> ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family.|$|R
