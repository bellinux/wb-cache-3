40|$|Adaptive digital {{beamforming}} (DBF) algorithms {{are designed}} to mitigate the effects of interference and noise in an radio frequency (RF) environment encountered by modern electronic support (ES) receivers. Traditionally, an ES receiver employs a single adaptive DBF algorithm {{that is part of}} the design of the receiver system. If the ES receiver is designed to form <b>multiple</b> <b>independent</b> <b>beams,</b> the same adaptive DBF algorithm is applied in each beam. Traditional receiver design is effective and works when system processing power is limited. Modern computer technology al-lows improvements over traditional receiver design, where a receiver is able to change the implemented algorithm based upon system usage. This dissertation provides a new ES receiver framework that attempts to make better use of the available com-puting resources by adaptively selecting the most efficient DBF algorithm for each beam that is able to meet system requirements. The framework contains a resource manager (RM) that facilitates adaptive algorithm selection through the use of a look-up-table (LUT).

40|$|Antennas with {{intelligent}} beamforming and {{beam steering}} enhance the overall system performance of future satellite systems for navigation and communication. The generation of <b>multiple</b> <b>independent</b> <b>beams</b> facilitates {{the use of}} SDMA and the simultaneous tracking of different satellites to guarantee reliable communication channels free from interference for any satellite constellation and terminal position. For jammer suppression and reduction of multipath propagation effects, definite nulling and side lobe attenuation can be used. Two different terminal antennas with digital beamforming (DBF) and planar radiators are developed. One antenna is used for demonstration purposes and operates in L-band to receive communication signals. The other one, designed for future navigation systems in C-band, has already been fabricated as a breadboard model and was successfully tested [1]. The integration of antenna elements, active RF-devices and digital signal processing requires a multilayer structure. Ground planes in the interfaces ensure proper shielding and well-defined signal propagation along microstrips or striplines. Of special importance therefore are the feeds of the patches for circular polarisation operating in a triplate configuration and the routing of the signal path between different layers...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} multibeam antenna {{constructed}} using Butler Matrix as a beamforming network (BFN) has received much attention {{due to its}} simplicity and low cost of implementation. It becomes more popular nowadays, as it is capable to reduce co-channel interference and then increase the channel capacity of a system. Co-channel interference could be reduced using multibeam antenna by focusing directional beams to the desired user direction, and be null to undesired user directions. In fact, there are few popular methods of constructing a multibeam antenna such as using digital beamformer, Blass Matrix and lens based beamformer, but the simplest one is by integrating linear antenna array with Butler Matrix. Butler Matrix is a well known BFN where it has a capability of producing <b>multiple</b> <b>independent</b> <b>beams</b> that directed at different directions. The number of generated beams, the beams angle directions, HPBW of each beams and total coverage angle of multibeam antenna could be varied dependent on the antenna array design configuration itself.

40|$|The Space Fed Lens Array (SFLA) is an {{alternative}} to a phased array antenna that replaces large numbers of expensive solid-state phase shifters with a single spatial feed network. SFLA {{can be used for}} multi-beam application where <b>multiple</b> <b>independent</b> <b>beams</b> can be generated simultaneously with a single antenna aperture. Unlike phased array antennas where feed loss increases with array size, feed loss in a lens array with more than 50 elements is nearly independent of the number of elements, a desirable feature for large apertures. In addition, SFLA has lower cost as compared to a phased array at the expense of total volume and complete beam continuity. For ground station applications, both of these tradeoff parameters are not important and can thus be exploited in order to lower the cost of the ground station. In this paper, we report the development and demonstration of a 952 -element beam-steerable SFLA intended for use as a low cost ground station for communicating and tracking of a low Earth orbiting satellite. The dynamic beam steering is achieved through switching to different feed-positions of the SFLA via a beam controller...|$|E

40|$|Phased-arrays {{are widely}} used in the {{military}} and space domain. They are pervading the civil domain in base stations and the like and distribution of systems over a single or multiple platforms is on the way. With increased connectivity and communication between partial systems, it is less problematic to have only partial systems onboard of an individual platform, as the sensor or communication systems will be formed by the co-operating system parts. In this environment, the importance of phased-arrays will increase further, due to the following reasons. Arrays offer great advantages in terms of performance. Antenna beams can be repositioned at a speed that is unthinkable for mechanically positioned systems. For the majority of the applications, the speed of this repositioning can almost be ignored and considered real-time. Beam widths can be altered by changing hardware settings only, and again at a lightning-fast speed. <b>Multiple</b> <b>independent</b> <b>beams</b> can be implemented simultaneously, and the system can perform multiple functionalities due to this versatility. Arrays offer great advantages in mode of degradation. Whereas conventional systems are relying on individual amplifiers, receivers, mechanical systems etc., phased arrays have multiple receive chains, multiple amplifiers, multiple beamforming hardware etc. Hence, the failure mechanisms are entirely different for arrays. Due to the increased amount of components, one may argue that {{it is more likely that}} an individual component may fail. However, and to the contrary, the mode of degradation is very graceful for the majority of the failures, and the system continues to operate at slightly reduced performance. Arrays offer great advantages in flexibility. More degrees of freedom are introduced as the power budget can be adapted to individual beams. The array may be divided in sub-arrays dynamically, for selecting different array-sizes depending on the functionality that is instantly required. For each of these subarrays, different pulse-repetition frequencies and individually adapted dutycycles can be implemented for each of the functionalities that are required at that point in time...|$|E
40|$|Phased arrays are {{electromagnetic}} {{antenna systems}} comprised of many radiating elements and processing electronics. Radiating elements are typically positioned {{in an orderly}} grid within the antenna aperture. In the receive mode of operation, radiating elements capture some of the signal energy from incoming radiation and guide these signals to processing electronics. Signals are filtered and amplified to maintain the desired sensitivity and complexly weighted using circuits with reconfigurable amplification gain and phase delay. Finally, all signals are combined. The summation of these complexly weighted spatial samples forms a spatial filter {{in the same way}} complexly weighted temporal samples establish a temporal filter in a finite impulse response discrete-time filter. Therefore, a phased array behaves like a spatial filter that strongly favors signals arriving from a specific direction. This favored direction represents the look angle of its beam, and the shape of the beam directly relates to the complex weights applied to the signals in the array. Analogous to the flexibility offered by digital filters, phased arrays enable agile beam steering, sidelobe control, and <b>multiple</b> <b>independent</b> <b>beams.</b> These capabilities have revolutionized radar, radioastronomy, and communication systems. Phased arrays have increasingly employed printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication techniques and processes to maximize array channel density, achieve lower profile, and minimize component integration cost. A few applications which leverage these qualities include low-cost radar, mobile satellite communication (SATCOM), and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). Further, PCB-based arrays readily accommodate advancements in highly integrated beamforming radio frequency integrated circuits (RFICs), multi-chip modules, and RF micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) device technologies. On a prior effort, an integrated unit cell design was developed for a PCB-based SATCOM array application. However, the design failed to meet the requirements. The primary objective of this work is to demonstrate an improved design using systematic microwave design techniques and modern analysis tools to meet the requirements for the same application. The proposed design must improve gain, bandwidth, size, and manufacturability over the prior design. Additionally, the design must be generally extensible to phased array implementations across the SHF band (3 - 30 GHz). This work discusses the advantages of phased arrays over continuous apertures (e. g. reflectors), reviews phased array theory, and proposes an improved unit cell design. The proposed design is 35 % smaller than a dime and consists of an orthogonally-fed, slot-coupled stacked patch antenna and dual-stage branchline coupler implemented in a multilayer PCB. Within the operating band from 10. 7 to 14. 5 GHz, the design achieves an average return loss of 15 dB, a uniform radiation pattern with peak realized gain of 4. 8 to 7. 0 dBic, cross-polarization level below - 17 dB, and stable performance in a closely-spaced array. When configured in an array, the design supports X/Ku-band SATCOM in full-duplex operation, electronically rotatable polarization, and a 47. 5 Ë grating lobe free conical scan range. Further, a Monte Carlo analysis proves the design accommodates tolerances of material properties and manufacturing processes, overcoming a major challenge in PCB-based high frequency antenna design...|$|E
