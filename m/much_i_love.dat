500|$|Contrary to speculation, Henderson's {{refusal to}} officially retire {{had not been}} delaying his {{eligibility}} for Hall of Fame induction. Since the 1970s, the five-year waiting period {{has been based on}} major league service only. Henderson was elected as part of the 2009 Hall of Fame vote, in his first appearance on the ballot. At a press conference two days after his election, the 50-year-old Henderson told reporters, [...] "I believe today, and people say I’m crazy, but if you gave me as many at-bats that you would give the runners out there today, I would outsteal every last one of them... they can always ring my phone and I'll come on down and help their ballclub, that's how <b>much</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> the game." ...|$|E

Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years. And I called my father, cause I realized I hadn’t spoken to him in 3 weeks and I told him how <b>much</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> him and how much I appreciated what a good father he's been." ...|$|E

500|$|Some things {{explored}} in the album were Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, {{the corruption of}} Las Vegas, and his incarceration in prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related {{to the death of}} Michael Cook. Radke stated that he chose not to write any songs about love because, [...] "...I'm not going to lie ... and try to write songs on how <b>much</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> somebody. I do have love, but {{there will be a lot}} of songs about just what I’ve been through." [...] Several songs focused on his departure from Escape the Fate after they kicked him out and replaced him with former Blessthefall singer Craig Mabbitt, with songs on the album that directly attacked both Mabbitt and Escape the Fate bassist Max Green. Prior to the album's release, Radke discussed what he intended to say about Escape the Fate on certain tracks, stating in an interview that he believed that the band's first album without Radke, This War Is Ours, was named after the conflict over Mabbitt taking over Radke's position in Escape the Fate. The band has since claimed it was not written about Radke, but he did not believe them.|$|E
500|$|When {{talking about}} [...] "On the Floor", during an {{interview}} with MTV, Lopez said that she wanted a song that would evolve her sound, [...] "it feels like me today, which I like.

I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how <b>much</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started. Since I was a little girl, I just totally connected with the idea of getting out there." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1946, Arnold scored {{his first}} major success with [...] "That's How <b>Much</b> <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> You". In 1948, he had five {{successful}} songs on the charts simultaneously. That year, he had nine songs in the top 10; five of these were number one and scored there for 40 of the year's 52 weeks. With Parker's management, Arnold continued to dominate, with 13 of the 20 best-scoring country music songs of 19471948. He became the host of Mutual Radio's Purina-sponsored segment of the Opry and of Mutual's Checkerboard Jamboree, a midday program shared with Ernest Tubb that was broadcast from a Nashville theater. Recorded radio programs increased Arnold's popularity, as did the CBS Radio series Hometown Reunion with the Duke of Paducah. Arnold quit the Opry during 1948, and his Hometown Reunion briefly broadcast in competition with the Opry on Saturday nights. In 1949 and 1950, he performed in the Columbia movies Feudin’ Rhythm and Hoedown.|$|E
2500|$|Contemporaries {{and historians}} have {{explored}} Sumner's personality at length. Sumner's friend Senator Carl Schurz praised Sumner's integrity, his [...] "moral courage," [...] the [...] "sincerity of his convictions,” and the [...] "disinterestedness of his motives.” [...] However, Sumner's Pulitzer-prize-winning biographer, David Donald, presents Sumner {{in his first}} volume, Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War (1960), as an insufferably arrogant moralist; an egoist bloated with pride; pontifical and Olympian, and unable to distinguish between large issues and small ones. [...] What's more, concludes Donald, Sumner was a coward who avoided confrontations with his many enemies, whom he routinely insulted in prepared speeches. But none of his friends at the time doubted his courage, and abolitionist Wendell Phillips, who knew Sumner well, remembered that southerners in the 1850s in Washington wondered, every time Sumner left his house in the morning, whether {{he would return to}} it alive. Just before he died, Sumner turned to his friend Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar. [...] "Judge," [...] he said, [...] "tell Emerson how <b>much</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> and revere him." [...] "He said of you once," [...] Hoar replied, [...] "that he never knew so white a soul." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} episode of Season 19, Hammond, Clarkson and May {{took a trip}} across the US with Clarkson {{selecting}} the Lexus LFA as the car of his choice, May selecting Aston Martin Vanquish for his choice and SRT Viper for Hammond.

The episode concluded with a race across America to the Mexican border with the loser being given the task to review the first ever Mexican sports car in the following episode. Hammond in this race with the Viper had lost so he was given the task to do the review. Clarkson while summing up the Lexus LFA said [...] "it is the best car I have ever driven" [...] and claimed [...] "if someone gave me a choice of selecting one car, I would have a blue Lexus LFA. That is how <b>much</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> this car". While describing the traits of Lexus LFA, Clarkson described [...] "The word immediate was invented for the throttle response of the Lexus LFA and for the steering, and the gearbox and just about everything else".|$|E
