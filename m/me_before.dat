25|$|After my father's {{appointment}} by {{his homeland}} as state {{official in the}} customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed {{in the study of}} calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to <b>me</b> <b>before</b> all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0... any number may be written.|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} for Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden wrote that, amid Material Worlds [...] "miraculous... radiance", the song {{represented}} [...] "passionate testament" [...] and [...] "a beautiful ballad whose ascendant long-line melody {{is the most}} distinguished of the album". In Melody Maker, Michael Watts described Living in the Material World as [...] "far, {{far removed from the}} Beatles" [...] and [...] "more interesting" [...] lyrically than All Things Must Pass. Watts noted the [...] "large autobiographical insights" [...] provided in Harrison's songwriting, of which [...] "Who Can See It" [...] showed [...] "he's found the way at last". Writing of Harrison's standing on an album he considered [...] "as personal, in its own way, as anything that Lennon has done": Watts said: [...] "Harrison has always struck <b>me</b> <b>before</b> as simply a writer of very classy pop songs; now he stands as something more than an entertainer.

500|$|Overall, One Hot Minute lyrically {{confronted the}} dark, melancholy and remorseful {{feelings}} Kiedis kept to himself. Many {{of the songs}} were written {{at a time when}} he was hiding his resumed addiction. [...] "Warped" [...] directly faced Kiedis's distraught moods as a hysterical cry for help: [...] "My tendency for dependency is offending me/It's upending me/I'm pretending to be strong and free from my dependency/It's warping me." [...] He also felt disappointed that [...] "no one had suspected that I'd slipped from my more than five years of sobriety." [...] The track itself was composed of heavy guitar riffs and echoing vocals which attempted to convey a distressed state. [...] "Aeroplane", the album's third single, was more upbeat than many of the album's songs; but it still contained various references to Kiedis's personal issues: [...] "Looking into my own eyes/I can't find the love I want/Someone better slap <b>me</b> <b>before</b> I start to rust/before I start to decompose." [...] The song also featured Flea's daughter Clara and her kindergarten class singing backing vocals on the last verse.|$|E
