40|$|Ton <b>de</b> <b>Leeuw</b> (1926 - 1996) {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the most important post-war Dutch composers. Taught among others by Olivier Messiaen and Jaap Kunst, and strongly influenced by non-Western music, <b>De</b> <b>Leeuw</b> was a teacher at the University of Amsterdam and professor of composition and electronic music at the Amsterdam Conservatory from 1959 to 1986, a position in which he educated many Dutch composers active today. His book Music of the Twentieth Century, first published in 1964, is still regarded as an authoritative work. Despite <b>De</b> <b>Leeuw's</b> formidable reputation as composer and teacher, and the regular performance of his works, hardly any scholarly research into his oeuvre has yet been undertaken. The current study is an attempt to change this, exploring five of <b>De</b> <b>Leeuw's</b> later choral compositions as representative of the style he described in terms of 'extended modality'. This study is aimed at understanding the nature and specificity of <b>De</b> <b>Leeuw's</b> later choral works, and thereby clarifying the place of the composer's later works - the choral works in particular - within the context of their time...|$|R
