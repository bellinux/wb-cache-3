40|$|The MCO is {{designed}} to facilitate the removal, processing and storage of the spent nuclear fuel currently stored in the East and West K-Basins. The MCO is a stainless steel canister approximately 24 inches in diameter and 166 inches long with cover cap installed. The shell and the collar which is welded to the shell are fabricated from 304 / 304 L dual certified stainless steel for the shell and F 304 /F 304 L dual certified for the collar. The shell has a nominal thickness of 1 / 2 inch. The top closure consists of a shield plug with four processing ports and a locking ring with jacking bolts to pre-load a metal seal under the shield plug. The fuel is placed in one of four types of baskets, excluding the SPR fuel baskets, in the fuel retention basin. Each basket is then loaded into the MCO which is inside the transfer cask. Once all of the baskets are loaded into the MCO, the shield plug with a process tube is placed into the open end of the MCO. This shield plug provides shielding for workers when the transfer cask, containing the MCO, is lifted from the pool. After being removed from the pool, the locking ring is installed and the jacking bolts are tightened to pre-load the <b>metal</b> <b>main</b> closure seal. The cask is then sealed and the MCO taken to the Cold Vacuum Drying (CVD) facility for bulk water removal and vacuum drying through the process ports. Covers for the process ports may be installed or removed as needed per operating procedures. The MCO is then transferred to the Canister Storage Building (CSB), in the closed transfer cask. At the CSB, the MCO is then removed from the cask and becomes one of two MCOs stacked in a storage tube. MCOs will have a cover cap welded over the shield plug providing a complete welded closure. A number of MCOs may be stored with just the mechanical seal to allow monitoring of the MCO pressure, temperature, and gas composition...|$|E
40|$|Investigation of the {{catalytic}} formation, reactivity {{and synthetic}} scope of sp³-gem-organodimetallic palladio(II) /main group <b>metal</b> (<b>main</b> group metal = tributylstannyl, dialkylalumino) alkane species {{has been carried}} out. Insight was expanded regarding the inter- and intramolecular reactivity of vinylmetallic reagents in presence of transition metal catalysts. New Pd-catalysed methodologies for carbon-carbon bond formation were developed, such as cyclopropanation of strained olefins, as well as tandem vinylalane arylation/ 1, 2 -methyl transfer and 1, 2 -diarylation. On the one hand, geminal π-allylpalladio(II) /tributylstannylalkane intermediates are produced by oxidative addition of Pd(0) catalysts to α-tributylstannylpropenyl acetate derivatives. They adopt ambiphilic behaviour depending on the transition metal pre-catalyst, {{presence or absence of}} phosphine ligands, and reaction temperature. In presence of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(0) with additional bidentate ligand, the carbenoid reactivity of these gem-organobismetallic species is exposed by reaction with dimethyl malonate. Deuterium-labeling studies demonstrated sequential functionalisation of the C-Sn and C-Pd bonds. Conversely, phosphine-free catalyst bis(dibenzylideneacetone) palladium(0) uncovers metal-carbene reactivity, and dimerisation and strained alkene cyclopropanation reactions are observed. The nature of the palladium catalyst controls the reactivity of the carbenoid species. Finally, bis(cyclooctadienerhodium(I) chloride) catalytically activates the alkenylstannane moiety, leaving the allylic acetate leaving group available for further transformations. On the other hand, gem-disubstituted trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy- and iodopalladio(II) / dialkylaluminoneopentane species are generated by intramolecular migratory insertion of 2, 2 -disubstituted- 1 -butenyldialkylalanes with σ-arylpalladium(II) triflate and iodide intermediates. Using excess Lewis-basic 1, 4 -diazabicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane, electron-rich tris(para-methoxyphenyl) phosphine ligand and acetonitrile as solvent, tandem arylation/ 1, 2 -alkyl migration from aluminum to carbon affords 7 -substituted- 1 -ethyl- 1 -methylindanes containing an all-carbon quaternary stereogenic centre in good yields. This reaction is tolerant of 6 -aryl methyl ethers, thioethers and trimethylsilanes. Deuterium labeling established that protiodealumination of the key neopentyl(methyl) aluminum triflate intermediate is caused by the acetonitrile solvent. The organodimetallic species in that study were shown to be configurationally stable, hence the stereospecificity of the process that proceeds via carbopalladation, transmetalation and reductive elimination of an alkylpalladium(II) intermediate. When applied to 1 -naphthyl triflate-tethered vinylalanes, the same reaction conditions mediate stereospecific 1, 2 -diarylation, leading to 2, 3, 3 a, 4 -tetrahydro- 1 H-cyclopenta[def]phenanthrenes in excellent yields. The influence of DABCO, tether length and solvent polarity was studied. Selective tandem arylation/ 1, 2 -methyl migration could also be achieved in non-polar solvent in absence of Lewis base. While steric properties took precedence over electronic considerations when inducing product selection, preagostic C-H···Pd interactions were postulated to facilitate 1, 3 -metal migration in the production of 1 H-cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene derivatives...|$|E
