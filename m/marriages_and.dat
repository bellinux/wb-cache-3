5|$|A catastrophic injury such as SCI puts {{strain on}} <b>marriages</b> <b>and</b> other romantic relationships, {{which in turn}} has {{important}} implications for quality of life. Partners of injured people often feel out of control, overwhelmed, angry, and guilty while having added work related to the injury, less help with responsibilities like parenting, and loss of wages. Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; supportive relationships are protective.|$|E
5|$|Henry is {{best known}} for his six <b>marriages</b> <b>and,</b> in particular, his efforts to have his first marriage, to Catherine of Aragon, annulled. His {{disagreement}} with the Pope on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the English Reformation, separating the Church of England from papal authority and appointing himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Despite his resulting excommunication, Henry remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was born}} in France at Le Mans on 5 March 1133, the eldest child of the Empress Matilda and her second husband, Geoffrey the Fair, Count of Anjou. The French county of Anjou was formed in the 10th century and the Angevin rulers {{attempted}} for several centuries to extend their influence and power across France through careful <b>marriages</b> <b>and</b> political alliances. In theory, the county answered to the French king, but royal power over Anjou weakened during the 11th century and the county became largely autonomous.|$|E
40|$|A {{rapid rise}} in women's {{education}} levels, {{an increase in}} the age at <b>marriage</b> <b>and</b> {{an increase in the}} age at which they have their Þrst child are key features of demographic transition in any country. Education is considered to be an essential component in this process because increases in educational attainment are likely to significantly affect both age at <b>marriage</b> <b>and</b> the duration between <b>marriage</b> <b>and</b> first birth - in particular increasing both the age at <b>marriage</b> <b>and</b> the time to Þrst child. This paper uses individual level unit record data from Pakistan to examine the effect of education on the age at <b>marriage</b> <b>and</b> on the duration between <b>marriage</b> <b>and</b> Þrst birth. We jointly estimate educational attainment, age at <b>marriage</b> <b>and</b> duration between <b>marriage</b> <b>and</b> first birth allowing for household level unobserved heterogeneity. Our estimation results show that ignoring correlation between the heterogeneity terms in the three main variables of interest results in inconsistent estimates. We find that educated women marry signiÞcantly later but education does not have any impact on the duration between <b>marriage</b> <b>and</b> first birth.

5|$|Most middle {{aged and}} young women in urban Maharashtra dress in western outfits such as skirts and {{trousers}} or shalwar kameez with the traditionally nauvari or nine-yard sari, disappearing from the markets {{due to a lack}} of demand.

In urban areas, the five-yard sari is worn by younger women for special occasions such as <b>marriages</b> <b>and</b> religious ceremonies. Maharashtrian brides prefer the very Maharashtrian saree – the Paithani – for their wedding day.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Marriage</b> <b>and</b> Family Therapist (MFT). An MFT license {{requires}} a Doctorate or master's degree.

In addition, most states require an oral exam. MFTs, as the title implies, work mostly with families and couples, addressing {{a wide range of}} common psychological problems.

5|$|Despite {{his success}} in winning the war, William had far less success in {{restoring}} royal power following the peace. In part, this was because William was unable to offer significant patronage, despite the expectations from the loyalist barons {{that they would be}} rewarded. William attempted to enforce the traditional rights of the Crown to approve <b>marriages</b> <b>and</b> wardships, but with little success. Nonetheless, William was able to reconstitute the royal bench of judges and reopen the royal exchequer. The government issued the Charter of the Forest, which attempted to reform the royal governance of the forests. The regency and Llywelyn came to agreement on the Treaty of Worcester in 1218, but its generous terms – Llywelyn became effectively Henry's justiciar across Wales – underlined the weakness of the English Crown.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{stresses}} that SCI places on people and relationships, {{studies have shown}} that people with SCI are able to have happy and fulfilling romantic relationships and <b>marriages,</b> <b>and</b> to raise well-adjusted children. People with SCI who wish to be parents may question their ability to raise children and opt not to have them, but studies have shown no difference in parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups. Children of women with SCI do not have worse self-esteem, adjustment, or attitudes toward their parents. Women who have children post-SCI have a higher quality of life, even though parenting adds demands and challenges to their lives.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, King Christian VIII of Denmark {{died and}} his only son, Frederick ascended the throne. Frederick was childless, {{had been through}} two {{unsuccessful}} <b>marriages,</b> <b>and</b> {{was assumed to be}} infertile. A succession crisis arose as Frederick ruled in both Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein, and the succession rules of each territory differed. In Holstein, the Salic law prevented inheritance through the female line, whereas no such restrictions applied in Denmark. Holstein, being predominantly German, proclaimed independence and called in the aid of Prussia. In 1852, the great powers called a conference in London to discuss the Danish succession. An uneasy peace was agreed, which included the provision that Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg would be Frederick's heir in all his dominions and the prior claims of others (who included Christian's own mother-in-law, brother-in-law and wife) were surrendered.|$|E
