5|$|Most phonemes of the Sinhalese {{language}} {{can be represented}} by a śuddha letter or by a miśra letter, but normally {{only one of them}} is considered correct. This one-to-many mapping of phonemes onto graphemes is a frequent source of <b>misspellings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Almost all the {{necessary}} corrections of <b>misspellings</b> have been made. Sometimes a stroke of the pen indicates an error, perhaps to be corrected later. Some corrections seem to be written by prima manu (e.g. Matthew 4:10; 5:19) others plainly secondary manu (Matthew 6; Luke 3; 10:35). The apostrophe is used even when not required, especially in εξ', and ουκ'.|$|E
5|$|Several critics {{noted that}} Florida sounded {{too eager to}} coin terms {{and that some of}} the pop {{cultural}} references and anecdotes were awkward. Environmental psychologist Michael Dudley pointed out copy-editing errors such as <b>misspellings,</b> and complained that Florida ignored existing literature on the topic of the connections between personalities and places. Likewise, Tom Hutton in the journal Economic Geography noted the absence of influential academics Allen Scott and Peter Hall in the text.|$|E
5|$|In this work, the {{inscriptions}} are in Roman capitals or Gothic miniature, and in {{some places}} seem to contain <b>misspellings,</b> making interpretation difficult. Its gold-lined frame and Latin inscriptions, with their subtle references to various passages in the two panels, indicate that the donor was wealthy and educated. The sides of each frame are lined with inscriptions from the Book of Isaiah (53:6–9, 12), Revelations (20:13, 21:3–4) or the Book of Deuteronomy (32:23–24). In the right hand panel, {{the wings of the}} figure of death contain Latin inscriptions on either side; on the left are the words CHAOS MAGNVM ("great chaos"), with UMBRA MORTIS ("shadow of death") inscribed to the right. A warning from Matthew 25:41 is written on both sides of death's head and wings, and extends from earth down into the hell section. It reads, Ite vos maledicti in ignem eternam ("Go, ye cursed, into everlasting fire"). In this way, van Eyck dramatically aligns the biblical extract in diagonal dual beams of light seemingly hurled from the heavens. Also in the section are letters reading ME OBVLIVI.|$|E
5|$|The {{academic}} {{debate about}} Anne's birth date focuses on two key dates: 1501 and 1507. Eric Ives, a British historian and legal expert, advocates the 1501 date, while Retha Warnicke, an American scholar {{who has also}} written a biography of Anne, prefers 1507. The key piece of surviving written evidence is a letter Anne wrote sometime in 1514. She wrote it in French to her father, who was still living in England while Anne was completing her education at Mechelen, in the Burgundian Netherlands, now Belgium. Ives argues that {{the style of the}} letter and its mature handwriting prove that Anne must have been about thirteen {{at the time of its}} composition, while Warnicke argues that the numerous <b>misspellings</b> and grammar errors show that the letter was written by a child. In Ives' view, this would also be around the minimum age that a girl could be a maid of honour, as Anne was to the regent, Margaret of Austria. This is supported by claims of a chronicler from the late 16th century, who wrote that Anne was twenty when she returned from France.|$|E
5|$|Edwards' {{trial was}} in June 1842 {{and was a}} media sensation. He secured a defense team of six lawyers, {{including}} John J. Crittenden, a sitting U. S. Senator, and Thomas F. Marshall, a sitting U. S. Representative. Both Crittenden and Marshall absented themselves from their legislative duties during the trial. One of the junior lawyers was William M. Evarts, who presented the opening remarks for the defense. Another defense lawyer was John Worth Edmonds, who Edwards paid with a forged check. Edwards' handsome appearance worked against him, {{when one of the}} bankers who had cashed the drafts identified him in court and remarked that he remembered Edwards because of his striking good looks. Edwards had also neglected to dispose of a marked bank bag from one of the banks that cashed the fraudulently obtained draft. A final tie-in was the commonality of <b>misspellings</b> between letters from Edwards and the forged letters. The trial ended with Edwards being convicted and given a 10-year prison sentence. The trial's proceedings were published by a New York newspaper, The Herald, and ran to 50,000 copies. None of Edwards' lawyers were ever paid for their services. He was sent to Sing Sing prison, where he attempted to use forged letters to escape. Edwards died in prison on January 27, 1847, of consumption. He was insane {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E

25|$|Critical {{comparisons}} between surviving {{portions of the}} manuscripts show {{an average of two}} to three changes per page from the original manuscript to the printer's manuscript, with most changes being corrections of scribal errors such as <b>misspellings</b> or the correction, or standardization, of grammar inconsequential to the meaning of the text. The printer's manuscript was further edited, adding paragraphing and punctuation to the first third of the text.|$|E
25|$|After transcribing and {{proofreading}} {{each letter}} to ensure document accuracy, PJM staff members research and annotate the letters, identifying people, places, and events so readers have {{much the same}} information Madison had when he received or wrote the correspondence. Considerable effort is made to render the printed texts as literal, faithful copies of the original manuscripts. <b>Misspellings,</b> not uncommon at the time, are retained so readers can see what Madison saw.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{internet}} slangs {{is not limited}} to the English language but extends to other languages as well. The Korean language has incorporated the English alphabet in the formation of its slang, while others were formed from common <b>misspellings</b> arising from fast typing. The new Korean slang is further reinforced and brought into everyday language use by television shows such as soap operas or comedy dramas like “High Kick Through the Roof” released in 2009.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Taupin self-published a book {{of poems}} called The Devil at High Noon. In 1994, Taupin's lyrics up through the Made in England album were {{collected}} into a hardcover book entitled Elton John & Bernie Taupin: The Complete Lyrics, published by Hyperion. However, it doesn't appear that Taupin was intimately involved in this project, as it contains multiple <b>misspellings</b> and outright misrenderings of the lyrics. It is also missing some of the rarities and B-sides found in the earlier collection. As with the 1973 collection, the songs are illustrated by various artists, this time in full colour throughout.|$|E
25|$|According to Silva Lake, textual critic, {{the text}} of the codex is a {{somewhat}} dilute form of family Π, with a large number of peculiar readings, most of which are either <b>misspellings</b> or careless and ignorant mistakes. An educated scribe could hardly have produced the variants in Mark 4:1; 6:26; 9:4; 13:3; 14:38; 16:4. The readings which it does not share with other representatives of Family Π are supported outside that family and they seem to be connected with the late Alexandrian group (C, L, M, N, Δ), but the number of the Alexandrian readings is not high and according to Silva they are rather result of accident than influence of a foreign text-type.|$|E
25|$|Portuguese {{names have}} a {{standard}} spelling, since names are considered as regular nouns, {{and are thus}} subject to the orthographical rules of the Portuguese language. The spelling of many names has evolved through times and with orthography reforms; at the same time, archaic forms of names survive, though they are considered <b>misspellings</b> by current spelling rules. The Acordo Ortográfico ("Orthographic Agreement"), valid in Brazil and Portugal, states on Section XI (Proper Nouns): Os nomes próprios personativos, locativos e de qualquer natureza, sendo portugueses ou aportuguesados, serão sujeitos às mesmas regras estabelecidas para os nomes comuns. ("Anthroponymic and toponymic proper nouns, if Portuguese or incorporated to the Portuguese language, {{are subject to the}} same spelling rules established to regular nouns.").|$|E

500|$|The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock {{called the}} album a [...] "surly milkshake of broken rock shards... from the artistic <b>misspellings</b> of song titles to the lyric collage {{on the inner}} sleeve and the abrasive, {{abstract}} guitar noises on the songs, Pretty on the Inside reveals the band's fascination with the New York no wave art and music scene of the '80s."

500|$|The first {{published}} lapsus calami of Megalosaurus was named in 1913. Ameghino added a letter, a [...] "u", into Megalosaurus. In doing so, he named a new genus, Megalousaurus, only {{to create a}} synonym of Megalosaurus. In 1926, von Huene published and article on a new species. In the paper, he misspelt the genus Megalosaurus four times. These <b>misspellings</b> were Megalasaurus, Megolosaurus, Megalosaurns and Megalosausus. Each time, he created a new synonym of Megalosaurus. Later, in 1964, Walker created another lapsus calami of Megalosaurus. This time, the [...] "g" [...] in its name was accidentally replaced with a [...] "q", erecting Meqalosaurus.|$|E
500|$|The Cooke and Wheatstone {{system did}} not support punctuation, lower case, or some letters. [...] Even the two-needle system omitted the letters J, Q, and Z; hence the <b>misspellings</b> of 'just' and 'Quaker'. [...] This caused some {{difficulty}} for the receiving operator at Paddington who repeatedly requested a resend after receiving K-W-A which he assumed was a mistake. [...] This continued until a small boy suggested the sending operator be allowed to complete the word, after which it was understood. [...] After arriving, Tawell was followed to a nearby coffee shop by a detective and arrested there.

500|$|In the mid-ground, the Archangel Michael's armour {{is heavily}} inscribed with esoteric and often {{difficult}} to source phrases. Letters on his breast plate read VINAE(X) while his jewel-encrusted oval buckler displays the cross and is decorated with Greek script reading ADORAVI TETGRAMMATHON AGLA. The meaning of this phrase has not been conclusively identified; some art historians believe it contains <b>misspellings</b> and has been misread. Friedländer transcribed the first word as ADORAVI while the final word AGLA is thought be taken from the first four letters of the Hebrew words for [...] "Thou Art Mighty", and thus may signify God; the word also appears in a floor tile in the Ghent Altarpiece. In the upper portion, gilded inscriptions running vertically across the edges of Christ's mantle read VENITE BENEDICTI PATRIS MEI ("Come, ye blessed of my father").|$|E
500|$|In {{several places}} Leland {{provides}} the Italian he was translating. According to Mario Pazzaglini, {{author of the}} 1999 translation, the Italian contains <b>misspellings,</b> missing words, and grammatical errors, and is in a standardised Italian rather than the local dialect one might expect. Pazzaglini concludes that Aradia represents material translated from dialect to basic Italian and then into English, creating a summary of texts, {{some of which were}} mis-recorded. Leland himself called the text a [...] "collection of ceremonies, 'cantrips,' incantations, and traditions" [...] and described it as an attempt to gather material, [...] "valuable and curious remains of ancient Latin or Etruscan lore" [...] that he feared would be lost. There is no cohesive narrative even in the sections that Leland attributes to the Vangelo. This lack of cohesion, or [...] "inconsistency", is an argument for the text's authenticity, according to religious scholar Chas S. Clifton, since the text shows no signs of being [...] "massaged ... for future book buyers." ...|$|E
500|$|Manga and anime {{publications}} praised Lenalee's {{character and}} {{her role in}} the series. While noting how the initial story arcs followed Allen's mission with other characters including Lenalee, Joy Kim of Manga Life found the introduction of her character appealing as it provided comedic momments to balance the bittersweet ending of the series' previous story arc. Nevertheless, Kim complained about Viz Media's multiple <b>misspellings</b> of Lenalee's name in the manga's third volume. Kevin Leathers of the UK Anime Network referred to her as [...] "the typical female influence" [...] because of the contrast she provides with other characters from D.Gray-man like Yu Kanda. The Fandom Post's John Rose found her more sympathetic than Allen's previous ally, Kanda, which helped him enjoy the story more. He credited her character's introduction with helping the manga to develop. Manga News agreed, finding Lenalee one of the more enjoyable characters introduced in the series. Leah Sacks of Comic Bulletin enjoyed Lenalee and Allen's relationship because of their similarities and because they do not argue unlike Allen's relationship with Kanda. Capsule Monsters' Michael Marr enjoyed Lenalee and the series' other supporting characters' roles because of their impact on Allen.|$|E
500|$|The band {{formed in}} 1967 at Manchester University, after Chris Judge Smith, {{who had already}} played in several British rhythm and blues groups whilst a pupil in Oundle School, {{returned}} {{from a trip to}} San Francisco and, inspired by the bands he had seen, put together a list of possible band names to form a new group. After an unsatisfactory audition they had both attended in response to an advert to form a band, he met fellow student Peter Hammill, who was playing some of his original songs. Hammill had begun writing songs and poetry at the age of 12 while at prep school, and progressed to playing in bands while a pupil at Beaumont College. He was then briefly employed as a computer programmer, during which time he subsequently claimed to have written much of the band's early material, before enrolling at Manchester. Smith was so impressed with the quality of Hammill's original material that the two agreed to form a band together. The band name chosen from Smith's list was based on a Van de Graaff generator, a mechanical device that produces static electricity with lightning-like flashes – the <b>misspellings</b> are accidental. Smith recalls the reason for this may have been that [...] Van de Graaff died in 1967, which was widely reported in the media.|$|E
500|$|Estimates of {{the average}} {{literacy}} rate in the Empire range from 5 to 30% or higher, depending {{in part on the}} definition of [...] "literacy". The Roman obsession with documents and public inscriptions indicates the high value placed on the written word. The Imperial bureaucracy was so dependent on writing that the Babylonian Talmud declared [...] "if all seas were ink, all reeds were pen, all skies parchment, and all men scribes, they would be unable to set down the full scope of the Roman government's concerns." [...] Laws and edicts were posted in writing as well as read out. Illiterate Roman subjects would have someone such as a government scribe (scriba) read or write their official documents for them. Public art and religious ceremonies were ways to communicate imperial ideology regardless of ability to read. Although the Romans were not a [...] "People of the Book", they had an extensive priestly archive, and inscriptions appear throughout the Empire in connection with statues and small votives dedicated by ordinary people to divinities, as well as on binding tablets and other [...] "magic spells", with hundreds of examples collected in the Greek Magical Papyri. The military produced a vast amount of written reports and service records, and literacy in the army was [...] "strikingly high". Urban graffiti, which include literary quotations, and low-quality inscriptions with <b>misspellings</b> and solecisms indicate casual literacy among non-elites. In addition, numeracy was necessary for any form of commerce. Slaves were numerate and literate in significant numbers, and some were highly educated.|$|E

The original driving forces of new vocabulary in leet were common <b>misspellings</b> and typing errors such as [...] "teh" [...] (generally considered lolspeak), and intentional <b>misspellings,</b> especially the [...] "z" [...] at the end of words ("skillz").
