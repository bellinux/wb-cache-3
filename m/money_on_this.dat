500|$|Terence Stamp's {{name was}} {{deliberately}} {{kept out of}} the opening credits {{in order to keep the}} secret he was voicing Jor-El. Stamp originally portrayed General Zod in the first two Superman films, starring Christopher Reeve. Gough and Millar wanted to provide answers for certain aspects of the Superman mythology, so at the start of season three they tied Jonathan's heart condition to Jor-El, where Jonathan makes a deal with Jor-El to be given the power to bring Clark back. This power ultimately puts a strain on Jonathan's heart. The refusal by the film department to allow Smallville to cast a body as a physical representation of Jor-El forced the special effects crew to come up with a creative way to display some sort of aid to help the audience visualize this disembodied voice which was supposed to be talking to Jonathan in season three's [...] "Exile". They decided to create a force field around whoever was speaking to Jor-El, which acted as Jor-El's voice, rippling as he spoke. To save <b>money</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> effect, the crew filmed John Schneider on a black backdrop, and Entity FX digitally added the force field around him. Wind machines and a spot light were added to help synthesize the atmosphere in the force field. At the time of season three's [...] "Memoria", where a scene depicting Jor-El and Lara placing baby Kal-El into his ship before the destruction of Krypton was scripted, Warner Bros. was working on a new Superman film, and it was going to be an origin story, and as a result was still banning Smallville from showing Jor-El. Millar was forced to take inspiration from comic book scribe Jeph Loeb. In one of Loeb's book, Jor-El and Lara are depicted as just a pair of hands holding on to each other after they place Kal-El into his spaceship. In season nine, the producers were able to provide the character with a physical appearance, and Julian Sands was cast for the role.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1874, the outlaws were {{suspected}} of {{holding up a}} stagecoach in Bienville Parish, Louisiana. Later another suspected stage robbery took place between Malvern and Hot Springs, Arkansas. There, the gang returned a pocket watch to a Confederate veteran, saying that Northern men had driven them to outlawry and that they intended to make them pay for it. On January 31, the gang robbed a southbound train on the Iron Mountain Railway at Gads Hill, Missouri. For {{the first of two}} times in all their train robberies, the outlaws robbed the passengers. In both train robberies, their usual target, the safe in the baggage car belonging to an express company, held an unusually small amount of <b>money.</b> <b>On</b> <b>this</b> occasion, the outlaws reportedly examined the hands of the passengers to ensure that they did not rob any working men. Many newspapers reported this was actually done by the [...] "Arthur McCoy" [...] gang.|$|E
2500|$|The Battle of Teruel {{exhausted}} {{the resources}} of the Republican Army. The Spanish Republican Air Force could not replace the airplanes and arms that it lost in the Battle of Teruel. [...] On the other hand, the Nationalists concentrated the bulk of their forces in the east as they prepared to drive through Aragon into Catalonia and the Levante. [...] Franco had the edge on resupply as the Nationalists now controlled the efficiently run industrial might in the Basque Country. [...] The Republican Government, however, had to leave the armament industry in Catalonia {{in the hands of the}} Anarchists. [...] One Anarchist observer reported that [...] "Notwithstanding lavish expenditures of <b>money</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> need, our industrial organization was not able to finish a single kind of rifle or machine gun or cannon...." [...] Franco's act of retaking Teruel was a bitter blow to the Republic after the high hopes engendered by its capture. [...] The recapture of Teruel also removed the last obstacle to Franco's breakthrough to the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

Wind machines and a spot light were added to help synthesize the atmosphere in the force field. Another aspect of the Superman mythology appeared in season three’s [...] "Hereafter", and was also created digitally: Superman’s cape. In the scene, Clark is touched by a boy who sees the moment of someone’s death; when he touches Clark he does not see Clark’s death but a cape flapping in the wind. Instead of just shooting a practical cape billowing, the scene was developed entirely by a computer. Created primarily by John Hahn, the idea was to show the cape but not so clearly that it would be obvious to the audience what they were looking at. As Beck explains, [...] "You get a hint of the 'S', but not quite." ...|$|E

2500|$|Music {{critics have}} been divided on [...] "Dance Again". Kate Callahan from MTV.com {{pointed out the}} {{similarities}} between [...] "Dance Again" [...] and [...] "On The Floor"—"The song is a fun dance pop track with a great beat, very much {{along the lines of}} their 2011 collaborative effort 'On The Floor'." [...] Callahan said that the formats of the two songs were very alike, but also added that as the title implies, the song is danceable, despite not being her most original song. Katherine St Asaph of Popdust gave the song a mixed review, stating [...] " [...] means “Dance Again” doesn’t have any of that swoon or allure, let alone one unifying riff, and it means that right before every verse-to-prechorus or prechorus-to-verse transition, you’re imagining the “la-lalalala...” chorus that doesn’t break out. What breaks out instead is the stately dance-pop that makes up the rest of “On the Floor,” more polite than pressing even when it’s even clearer that the metaphor here is dancing-as-sex." [...] Robbie Daw of the website Idolator gave the song a positive review, writing that it was far more superior and much more euphoric dance-pop offering than [...] "On the Floor". Daw added that [...] "the American Idol judge goes for more of a cheery, almost Kylie Minogue-esque dance-pop vibe with “Dance Again”.
