500|$|Alongside Aladdins {{other main}} characters, Jasmine embodies the film's {{central theme of}} longing for freedom from some form of {{confinement}} or oppression. Both the film and its characters are influenced by Jasmine's [...] "power of choice". The character's desire for both freedom {{and a sense of}} agency is constantly threatened by other characters and situations; the sole decision Jasmine maintains complete agency over during the entire film is who she falls in love with – aided by the Genie's refusal to use his magical powers to force characters to fall in love – although not who she marries. Although Jasmine yearns to explore her kingdom beyond the confines of her palace, she only gets as far as the marketplace before returning home. Jasmine explores [...] "the idea that enclosing yourself behind walls can <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>more</b> vulnerable, not less", as evidenced {{by the fact that the}} character is unprepared and knows little about money when she ventures into the marketplace for first time. In the film, Jasmine releases a flock of birds from their cage, which serves as a metaphor for her own situation, being [...] "caged from a world she has never seen and yearns to be released." [...] Jasmine's bedroom is also shaped like a bird cage to represent her own confinement. Jasmine's story also explores themes such as civil rights, racial tolerance, social hierarchy, and Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.|$|E

2500|$|Deepak Chopra, {{founding}} {{president of}} Maharishi Ayur-Veda Products International, Inc (MAPI), the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine and former {{medical director of}} the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center for Stress Management and Behavioral Medicine, says, according to Stephen Barrett {{in an article in the}} journal Alternative Medicine and Ethics, that [...] "If you have happy thoughts, then you make happy molecules. On the other hand, if you have sad thoughts, and angry thoughts, and hostile thoughts, then you make those molecules which may depress the immune system and <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>more</b> susceptible to disease." [...] Barrett goes on to say that, while the TM technique and other relaxation techniques may temporarily relieve stress, claims made by Chopra that happy or sad thought may affect the molecular levels of the body and the immune system have no scientific basis.|$|E

5000|$|Jonah Berger, a {{professor}} of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania conducted {{a study on the}} spreadability of emotions via social media and concluded that, [...] "Anger is a high-arousal emotion, which drives people to take action...It <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> feel fired up, which <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>more</b> likely to pass things on.” Additionally, online audiences may be susceptible to outrage porn in part because of their feeling of powerlessness to managers, politicians, creditors and celebrities.|$|R
