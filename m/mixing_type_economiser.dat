Objectives: To explore different characteristics of <b>mixed</b> <b>type</b> BCC. Design: Cross sectional study. Materials and Methods: 825 patients with BCC enrolled in this study. Results: Among 825 patients, 512 (62 %) were male. Three hundred and fifty five (43 %) presented with nodular subtype, 267 (32. 4 %) with mixed subtype, 25 with superficial and the 178 remaining presented with other subtypes. Four hundred and eighty three (58. 6 %) of the lesions were on the face, 243 (29. 5 %) on scalp, 52 (6. 3 %) on ears, 20 (2. 4 %) on neck, 15 (1. 8 %) on trunk and 12 (1. 4 %) on extremities. Anatomic distribution of <b>mixed</b> <b>type</b> was as follows: 137 on face, (51. 4 %), 100 (37. 3 %) on scalp, 19 (7 %) on ear, 6 (2. 1 %) on neck, 4 (1. 5 %) extremity and 1 (0. 7 %) on trunk, which the difference from non <b>mixed</b> <b>types</b> was statistically significant (P = 0. 002). The mean diameter of the <b>mixed</b> <b>types</b> and non <b>mixed</b> <b>type</b> BCCs were significantly different (2. 7 ± 2. 1 cm vs. 2. 2 ± 1. 6 cm; P = 0. 01. The prevalence of necrosis in <b>mixed</b> <b>type</b> BCC was two times higher than non <b>mixed</b> <b>type</b> BCCs (OR = 2. 3, CI 95 % 1. 3 - 3. 9, P = 0. 001). The most frequent combined subtypes were nodular-infiltrative (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: <b>Mixed</b> <b>type</b> BCC has differences with other BCC subtypes in anatomical distribution and tumor diameter. Indeed, <b>mixed</b> <b>type</b> BCCs are frequently composed of aggressive subtypes than nonaggressive subtypes...|$|R

The {{appropriate}} {{choice of}} a method for imputation of missing data becomes especially important when the fraction of missing values is large and the data are of <b>mixed</b> <b>type.</b> The proposed dynamic clustering imputation (DCI) algorithm relies on similarity information from shared neighbors, where <b>mixed</b> <b>type</b> variables are considered together.

Nevertheless, the <b>mixed</b> <b>type</b> choledochal cysts are extremely rare especially in adults. A case {{report of a}} 20 -year-old female {{with a history of}} upper abdominal pain that was diagnosed with cholecystitis with stone and who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy is discussed. Choledochal malformation was found intraoperatively. Magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRCP) and USG after first surgery revealed extrahepatic fusiform dilatation of the CBD; therefore, provisional diagnosis of type I choledochal cyst was made. Complete resection of the cyst was performed, and a <b>mixed</b> <b>type</b> I and II choledochal cyst was found intraoperatively.
