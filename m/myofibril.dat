25|$|After {{spending}} his postdoctoral period in America, Perry returned to Cambridge. Using his expertise in manipulating muscle tissue combined with his biochemical knowledge, {{he was able}} to isolate <b>myofibril</b> in an uncontracted state, and from that {{he was able to}} characterize their protein components. Further observation of the myofibrils, and the crude preparations of the extracted contractile protein actins and myosins taken from them, showed that they required trace levels of calcium for contractile activity. Perry then used the calcium chelator EGTA to confirm that calcium was essential for the regulation of muscle contraction. This was a major breakthrough in the understanding of how muscle contractions are regulated. Seven years later Setsuro Ebashi, identified the factor responsible for calcium sensitivity in muscles, which he called troponin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{excretory}} system {{consists of}} three regions. The basal region has three cells found within the posterior portion of the midgut. The anterior and superior cavities are formed by the bases of four Malpighian tubules. The superior cavity opens into the lumen of the small intestine. The rectum is a large but thin-walled sac that occupies the posterior fifth of the larvae. The release of waste {{is controlled by the}} rectal valves that lead to the anus. Sometimes, the larvae secrete a liquid that consists of uric acid, water and salts. These contents are often carried outside by workers and ejected, but colonies under water stress may consume the contents. In the reproductive system, queens release a pheromone that prevents dealation and oogenesis in virgin females; those tested in colonies without a queen begin oocyte development after dealation and take up the egg-laying role. Flight muscle degeneration is initiated by mating and juvenile hormones, and prevented by [...] Histolysis begins with the dissolution of the <b>myofibril</b> and the slow breakdown of the myofilaments. Such dissolution continues until it reaches the only free Z-line materials, which would also disappear; only the nuclei and lamellar bodies remain. In one study, the amino acids increase in the hemolymph after insemination.|$|E
50|$|Several {{changes to}} {{asynchronous}} muscles' macroscopic structure provide it with high force production and efficiency at high contraction frequencies. A critical adaptation is that asynchronous muscles maintain a tonic level of calcium instead of cycling calcium between contractions. This {{is evident in}} their long twitch duration (see section below). This is due to relatively spare sarcoplasmic reticulum. Because of requirements for high force production, myofiber and <b>myofibril</b> diameters are increased and {{the large amount of}} ATP necessary leads to high mitochondria densities. In Cotinus mutabilis, asynchronous muscles are composed of 58.1% <b>myofibril,</b> 36.7% mitochondria, and 1.6% sarcoplasmic reticulum. In comparison, synchronous muscles in Schistocerca americana are composed of 65% <b>myofibril,</b> 23.5% mitochondria and 9.6% sarcoplasmic reticulum. Although synchronous muscle has a higher percentage of <b>myofibril,</b> the cross-sectional area of asynchronous <b>myofibril</b> is 3.7 µm2 as opposed to 0.82 µm2 in synchronous muscle for the previously described species.|$|E

40|$|Muscle {{forces are}} {{produced}} by repeated stereotypical actomyosin units called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are chained into linear <b>myofibrils</b> spanning the entire muscle fiber. In mammalian body muscles, <b>myofibrils</b> are aligned laterally, resulting in their typical cross-striated morphology. Despite this detailed textbook knowledge about the adult muscle structure, it is still unclear how cross-striated <b>myofibrils</b> are built in vivo. Here, we investigate the morphogenesis of Drosophila abdominal muscles and establish them as an in vivo model for cross-striated muscle development. By performing live imaging, we find that long immature <b>myofibrils</b> lacking a periodic actomyosin pattern are built simultaneously in the entire muscle fiber and then align laterally to give mature cross-striated <b>myofibrils.</b> Interestingly, laser micro-lesion experiments demonstrate that mechanical tension precedes {{the formation of the}} immature <b>myofibrils.</b> Moreover, these immature <b>myofibrils</b> do generate spontaneous Ca 2 +-dependent contractions in vivo, which, when chemically blocked, result in cross-striation defects. Taken together, these results suggest a myofibrillogenesis model in which mechanical tension and spontaneous muscle twitching synchronize the simultaneous self-organization of different sarcomeric protein complexes to build highly regular cross-striated <b>myofibrils</b> spanning the length of large muscle fibers...|$|R
40|$|The major {{purposes}} of this study were to: (1) clearly identify intermediate filaments (IFs) and elucidate their structural arrangement at the myofibrillar Z-lines in non-diseased, mature mammalian striated muscle cells, and (2) determine the localization of constituent proteins of the IFs by immunogold localization. IFs running transversely to the long axis of the cell and connecting Z-lines of adjacent <b>myofibrils</b> were identified by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of plastic-embedded porcine semitendinosus muscle, especially in areas of cells where <b>myofibrils</b> were less tightly packed. When the plane of section included the periphery of <b>myofibrils</b> at their Z-lines, examination indicated that IFs surround, rather than significantly penetrate, <b>myofibrils.</b> IFs also were identified that connect <b>myofibrils</b> (especially at their Z-lines) to nuclei, mitochondria, and the sarcolemma;In order to examine the three-dimensional structural relationship of IFs and <b>myofibrils,</b> micrographs were taken after tilting the specimen to obtain stereo pairs. The results suggest that IFs primarily surround <b>myofibrils</b> at their Z-lines and that a few IFs are arranged in a longitudinal fashion along the periphery of the myofibrils;Results from TEM-immunogold labeling studies indicate that desmin is located primarily at the periphery of Z-lines and nearby I-band regions in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. A lower level of desmin labeling was observed along the periphery of the long axis of the <b>myofibrils,</b> which suggested the presence of some longitudinal IFs. The immunogold labeling pattern observed with anti-synemin was very similar to that obtained with anti-desmin. However, the intensity of the synemin labeling was generally lower than that observed with anti-desmin. Intense labeling with anti-desmin was observed in some areas near the sarcolemma and nuclei in samples examined after pre-embedding labeling. The linear pattern of the labeling suggests that IFs attach <b>myofibrils</b> to those membranous structures;These results support a cytoskeletal concept that IFs link adjacent <b>myofibrils</b> together at their Z-lines, and <b>myofibrils</b> to membranous structures. The IFs are attached to <b>myofibrils</b> primarily in a lateral rather than end-on fashion. The IFs identified by TEM contain desmin. Synemin is either part of, or attached to, desmin IFs...|$|R

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} specific for {{the muscle}} protein titin {{have been used}} in conjunction with muscle-specific antibodies against myofibrillar myosin heavy chains (MHCs) and desmin to study myogenesis in cultured cells. Desmin synthesis is initiated in replicating presumptive myoblasts, whereas the synthesis of titin and MHC is initiated simultaneously in their progeny, the postmitotic, mononucleated myoblasts. Both titin and MHC are briefly localized to nonstriated and thereafter to definitively striated <b>myofibrils.</b> At no stage during myofibrillogenesis is either protein observed as part of a sequence of mini-sarcomeres. Titin antibodies bind to the A-I junction, MHC antibodies to the A bands in nascent, maturing, and mature <b>myofibrils.</b> In contrast, desmin remains distributed as longitudinal filaments until well after the definitive <b>myofibrils</b> have aligned laterally. This tight temporal and topographical linkage between titin and myosin is also observed in postmitotic, mononucleated myoblasts and multinucleated myotubes when myofibrillogenesis is perturbed with Colcemid or taxol. Colcemid induces elongating postmitotic mononucleated myoblasts and multinucleated myotubes to round up and form Colcemid myosacs. The <b>myofibrils</b> that emerge in these rounded cells are deployed in convoluted circles. The time required for their nonstriated <b>myofibrils</b> to transform into striated <b>myofibrils</b> is greatly protracted. Furthermore, as Colcemid induces immense desmin intermediate filament cables, the normal spatial relationships between emerging individual <b>myofibrils</b> is distorted. Despite these disturbances at all stages, the characteristic temporal and spatial relationship observed in normal <b>myofibrils</b> between titin and MHC is observed in <b>myofibrils</b> assembling in Colcemid-treated cells. Newly born postmitotic mononucleated myoblasts, or maturing myotubes, reared in taxol acquire a star-shaped configuration and are induced to assemble "pseudo- striated <b>myofibrils.</b> " Pseudo-striated <b>myofibrils</b> consist of laterally aggregated 1. 6 -micron long, thick filaments that interdigitate, not with thin filaments, but with long microtubules.

To explore whether titin stiffness affects the kinetics of cardiac myofibrillar contraction and relaxation, we used subcellular <b>myofibrils</b> from the left ventricles of homozygous and heterozygous N 2 B-knockout mice which express truncated cardiac titins lacking the unique elastic N 2 B region. Compared with <b>myofibrils</b> from wild-type mice, <b>myofibrils</b> from knockout and heterozygous mice exhibit increased passive myofibrillar stiffness. To determine the kinetics of Ca(2 +) -induced force development (rate constant kACT), <b>myofibrils</b> from knockout, heterozygous and wild-type mice were stretched to the same sarcomere length (2. 3 microm) and rapidly activated with Ca(2 +).
