50|$|Caveat: This Battle lasted {{more than}} a month, with {{assignments}} in considerable flux. Any hierarchy of unit within Corps within Army within Army Group is inherently a snapshot of a single moment in that flux. The hierarchy given here is at a moment nearly {{at the end of}} the Battle. To fully understand the hierarchy at any given moment in the Battle, you must not rely on this page alone. For example, the hierarchy here places the U. S. 7th Armored Division in XVIII Corps in U. <b>S.</b> <b>First</b> Army in 12th Army Group. However, when the German attack began on 16 December 1944, the alignment of U. S. 7th Armored Division was (XIII Corps, U. S. Ninth Army, 12th Army Group). Later that day, the alignment became (VIII Corps, U. <b>S.</b> <b>First</b> Army, 12th Army Group). On 20 December, the alignment became (XVIII Corps, U. <b>S.</b> <b>First</b> Army, 12th Army Group) and on the same day (XVIII Corps, U. <b>S.</b> <b>First</b> Army, 21st Army Group). On 18 January 1945, the final alignment became (XVIII Corps, U. <b>S.</b> <b>First</b> Army, 12th Army Group) -- the alignment in the hierarchy given here.|$|R
