60|$|If the {{injustice}} {{is part of}} the necessary friction of the <b>machine</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> let it go, let it go: perchance it will wear smooth--certainly the machine will wear out. If {{the injustice}} has a spring, or a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself, then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then I say, break the law. Let your life be a counter-friction to stop the machine. What I {{have to do is to}} see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn.|$|E
60|$|If then (to {{return to}} ourselves) there be such strong {{obstacles}} {{in the way}} of our drawing benefit either from the maxims of policy or the principles of justice: what hope remains that the British Nation should repair, by its future conduct, the injury which has been done?--We cannot advance a step towards a rational answer to this question--without previously adverting to the original sources of our miscarriages; which are these:--First; a want, {{in the minds of the}} members of government and public functionaries, of knowledge indispensible for this service; and, secondly, a want of power, in the same persons acting in their corporate capacities, to give effect to the knowledge which individually they possess.--Of the latter source of weakness,--this inability as caused by decay in the <b>machine</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> and by illegitimate forces which are checking and controuling its constitutional motions,--I have not spoken, nor shall I now speak: for I have judged it best to suspend my task for a while: and this subject, being in its nature delicate, ought not to be lightly or transiently touched. Besides, no immediate effect can be expected from the soundest and most unexceptionable doctrines which might be laid down for the correcting of this evil.--The former source of weakness,--namely, the want of appropriate and indispensible knowledge,--has, in the past investigation, been reached, and shall be further laid open; not without a hope of some result of immediate good by a direct application to the mind; and in full confidence that the best and surest way to render operative that knowledge which is already possessed--is to increase the stock of knowledge.|$|E

25|$|Nadezhda von Meck {{saw things}} very differently. To her, filling {{the roles of}} mother, nurse, governess, dressmaker, housekeeper, and valet was far easier to bear than the humiliation of seeing her husband as a cog in the <b>machine</b> <b>of</b> a <b>government</b> organization. Neither did {{fulfilling}} all those domestic duties lower her resolve or weaken her energy in urging {{him to make a}} break. Russia, desperately short of railways, was expanding its communications network rapidly, and Nadezhda was far-sighted enough to see that a future for her husband lay there. She continually exerted pressure on him to find a partner with capital and to join the boom in Russian railway construction.|$|R
6000|$|The {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} Rousseau gives us not the least help towards the solution of any of the problems of actual government, because these are naturally both suggested and guided by considerations of expediency and improvement. It is as if he had never really settled the ends for which government exists, beyond the construction of the symmetrical <b>machine</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> itself. He is a geometer, not a mechanician; or shall we say that he is a mechanician, and not a biologist concerned with the conditions of a living organism. The analogy of the body politic to the body natural was as present to him as it had been to all other writers on society, but he failed to seize the only useful lessons which such an analogy might have taught him--diversity of structure, difference of function, development of strength by exercise, growth by nutrition--all of which might have been serviceably translated into the dialect of political science, and might have bestowed on his conception of political society more of the features of reality. We see no room for the free play of divergent forces, the active rivalry of hostile interests, the regulated conflict of multifarious personal aims, which can never be extinguished, except in moments of driving crisis, by the most sincere attachment to the common causes of the land. Thus the modern question which is of such vital interest for all the foremost human societies, of the union of collective energy with the encouragement of individual freedom, is, if not wholly untouched, at least wholly unillumined by anything that Rousseau says. To tell us that a man on entering a society exchanges his natural liberty for civil liberty which is limited by the general will,[265] is to give us a phrase, where we seek a solution. To say that if it is the opposition of private interests which made the establishment of societies necessary, it is the accord of those interests which makes them possible,[266] is to utter a truth which feeds no practical curiosity. The opposition of private interests remains, in spite of the yoke which their accord has imposed upon it, but which only controls and does not suppress such an opposition. What sort of control? What degree? What bounds? ...|$|E

40|$|Given the {{centrality}} of information and communication to the activities and institutions <b>of</b> law and <b>government</b> {{it is not surprising}} that during the early turbulent days of the digital revolution enthusiasts imagined that the new technology would work dramatic changes on this critical sphere, changes far greater in magnitude than those flowing from such past innovations as calculators, tape recorders, or copy <b>machines.</b> Students <b>of</b> <b>government</b> and consultants drew analogies between transformations taking place in the private sector (the emergence of e-commerce and distributed, virtual enterprises) and what governments might or should or would become (e-government). Greater efficiency, improved accessibility and performance, and even gains in public accountability were predicted. Judged against such visions and the changes digital technology has brought about in important commercial areas over the past decade, the take-up of digital technology by U. S. courts has been both slow and uneven. This article examines some of the institutional factors that have produced this result. Three applications of the new technology to the work of courts furnish the basis for this investigation. In order, the article examines the extent to which U. S. court systems have: 1) adopted new modes of case citation that are independent of print law reports; 2) assured the availability of adequate and consistent online legal information to judges; and 3) transformed litigation from a process carried out by means of paper filings, paper orders and judgments, held and ultimately archived in official paper records to one reliant on electronic filings and data...|$|R
