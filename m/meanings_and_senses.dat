In his work [...] "The languages {{of the seat}} {{of war in the}} East. With a survey of the three families of language, Semitic, Arian, and Turanian." [...] he called these languages [...] "Turanian". Müller divided this group into two subgroups, the Southern Division, and the Northern Division. Hungarian language was classed by him as a member of this Northern Division, in the Finnic Class, in the Ugric Branch, with the Voguls and Ugro-Ostiakes as closest relatives. (In the long run, his theory proved unsound, but his Northern Division was renamed and re-classed as the Ural-Altaic languages.) His theory was well known and widely discussed in international scientific circles, and was known to Hungarian scientists as well. He was invited to Budapest, the Hungarian capital, by Ármin Vámbéry, the Orientalist and Turkologist, in 1874, and become an associate member of the Hungarian Aceademy of Sciences. His public lectures received wide attention, and his terms (originally borrowed by him from Persian texts like the Shahnameh which used the term [...] "Turan" [...] to denote the territories of Turkestan, north of Amu Darya river, inhabited by nomadic warriors) [...] "Turan" [...] and [...] "Turanian" [...] become denizens in Hungarian language as [...] "Turán" [...] and [...] "turáni". The meaning of these terms was never defined officially. Vámbéry himself used [...] "Turan" [...] to denote the areas of Eastern Balkan, Central and Inner Asia inhabited by Turkic peoples, and used [...] "Turanian" [...] to denote those Turkic peoples and languages (and he meant the Finno-Ugric peoples and languages as the members of this group), which lived in or originated from this [...] "Turan" [...] area. Hungarian scientists shared his definition. But in common parlance these terms were used in many (and often different) <b>meanings</b> <b>and</b> <b>senses.</b>|$|E

In this context questions regarding the work centrality in its social and psychological dimensions emerge, as well as the meaning processes associated with working. This paper presents and analyzes the main theoretical approaches identified in the international and Brazilian literatures in the field of psychology making reference to <b>meanings</b> <b>and</b> <b>senses,</b> particularly those attributed to working. Different epistemological grounds supporting the current studies have been identified: cognitive, constructionist, cultural studies, existentialist and sociohistorical.

Essas queixas afetivo-sexuais fornecem elementos para reflexão sobre códigos de conduta vigentes com relação aos gêneros e ao exercício da sexualidade. A pesquisa adota perspectiva qualitativa tendo como base o método dos relatos orais na forma de depoimento. Os depoimentos revelam vivências singulares e diferentes formas de negociação no contexto social, sendo a sexualidade imbricada nesta dinâmica de forma problematizada. Os significados e sentidos relacionados com a vivência afetivo-sexual partem de códigos, normas e valores em vigor no contexto social família, escola, meios de comunicação, saber especializado, entre outros, que fornecem contornos para sensações, situações, palavras e estados corporais. As concepções de gênero partem de versões associadas aos estereótipos vigentes, sendo que o ser homem e o ser mulher, respectivamente, são relacionados à atividade e à passividade. Os depoimentos revelam a tensão entre a experiência afetivo-sexual idealizada e a experiência afetivo-sexual vivida, intensificando a angústia e o sofrimento. O modelo de atenção psicológica oferecido pelo Plantão Psicológico prioriza a valorização das experiências vividas a partir do encontro, do cuidado e da atenção, afastando-se de um enfoque normativo do atendimento psicoterapêutico.

These complaints provide elements for reflexion about current behavior codes which are related to genders and to the exercise of sexuality. This research adopts a qualitative perspective based upon the method of oral description in the form of depositions. The depositions reveal singular life experiences and different forms of negotiation in the social context in which the sexuality is concealed in this dynamic in a problematic way. The <b>meanings</b> <b>and</b> <b>senses</b> related to the sexual-affective life experience derive from codes, rules and values which are present in the social context family, school, media, specialized knowledge, among others, and provide framework for sensations, situations, words and body states. The conceptions of gender derive from versions associated with the current stereotypes in which the men-being and the woman-being are related to activity and passivity, respectively. The depositions also reveal the tension between the idealized sexual-affective experience and the lived sexual-affective experience, intensifying anguish and suffering.
