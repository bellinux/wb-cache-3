5|$|Dubrovnik was a {{flotilla}} leader {{built by}} a British shipyard in 1930–1931. Captured by the Italians in April 1941 she was put into service as Premuda, and was the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> effective Italian war prize ship of World War II. She was captured by the Germans after the Italian armistice and served as TA32 until she was scuttled {{near the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> pivotal of his early compositions because his performance of the song at an April 15, 1972, live radio concert at Sigma Studios on WMMR in Philadelphia, and the subsequent airplay this live version received on the station, brought him to the attention of major record labels, including Columbia, with whom he would sign a recording contract in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Scholar John Lindow {{proposes that}} a {{potentially}} understated mythological importance of Sif's {{role in the}} story of her sheared hair exists; her headpiece is created along with the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> powerful items in Norse mythology. Lindow further states that it may be easy to lose sight of the central role Sif plays in the creation of these objects.|$|E

5|$|The Cretan War (205–200 BC) {{was fought}} by King Philip V of Macedon, the Aetolian League, many Cretan cities (of which Olous and Hierapytna were the <b>most</b> <b>important)</b> <b>and</b> Spartan pirates against {{the forces of}} Rhodes and later Attalus I of Pergamum, Byzantium, Cyzicus, Athens, and Knossos.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> {{high profile}} of the {{committees}} are the pairs of standing committees. These each have six members. The chairman of each legislation committee is chosen from amongst the government members, the deputy chair from amongst non-government members. The reverse {{is the case for}} the references committees. Because the chair has a casting vote {{in the event of a}} committee vote being tied, the government effectively controls the legislation committees, while the non-government parties control the references committees.|$|E
5|$|A {{characteristic}} of Douglas's work is {{his attention to}} both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his joinery, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building. However, {{in the cases of}} Rowden Abbey and StMichael and All Angels Church, Altcar, the entire buildings were timber-framed.|$|E

5|$|A {{script for}} text {{was not used}} by the Muisca, but the numerals were written with hieroglyphs. They have been {{analysed}} by various authors, such as Joaquín Acosta, Alexander von Humboldt and Liborio Zerda, and appear as rock art and on textiles. The frog is the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> is represented in the numbers from one (ata) to twenty (gueta) five times, because the Muisca didn't have hieroglpyhs for the numbers 11 to 19, so used the numerals one to nine again in combination with ten; fifteen was thus ten-and-five; qhicħâ hɣcſcâ.|$|E
5|$|De Lucía {{was noted}} for his fast and fluent picados (fingerstyle runs). A master of contrast, he often {{juxtaposed}} picados and rasgueados (flamenco strumming) with more sensitive playing and {{was known for}} adding abstract chords and scale tones to his compositions with jazz influences. These innovations saw him {{play a key role}} in the development of traditional flamenco and the evolution of new flamenco and Latin jazz fusion from the 1970s. He received acclaim for his recordings with flamenco singer Camarón de la Isla in the 1970s, recording ten albums which are considered some of the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> influential in flamenco history.|$|E
5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Dubrovnik {{was captured by}} the Italians. After a refit, which included the replacement of some of her weapons and the shortening of her mainmast and funnels, she was commissioned into the Royal Italian Navy as Premuda. In Italian service she was mainly used as an escort and troop transport. In June 1942, {{she was part of}} the Italian force that attacked the Allied Operation Harpoon convoy attempting to relieve the island of Malta. In July 1943, she broke down and put into Genoa for repair and a refit. Premuda was the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> effective Italian war prize ship of World War II.|$|E

5|$|In baseball, {{the home}} run {{is one of the}} most popular aspects of the game. Thus, the career record for home runs is among the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> {{respected}} records in baseball. The road to this record has been closely followed and each additional home run Bonds hits extends the current record further. On August 7, 2007, Barry Bonds became the major leagues' career home run champion by hitting his 756th career home run, which surpassed Hank Aaron's total. the ball was caught by Pistolay.|$|E
5|$|In their {{forty years}} of {{practice}} after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues {{can be in the}} pay of drug companies– often undisclosed– and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one drug company. Aside from all this, for several of the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> enduring problems in medicine, {{we have no idea what}} the best treatment is, because it's not in anyone's financial interest to conduct any trials at all.|$|E
5|$|More than 200 Upanishads are known, {{of which}} the first dozen or so are the oldest and <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> are {{referred}} to as the principal or main (mukhya) Upanishads. The mukhya Upanishads are found mostly in the concluding part of the Brahmanas and Aranyakas and were, for centuries, memorized by each generation and passed down orally. The early Upanishads all predate the Common Era, five of them in all likelihood pre-Buddhist (6th century BCE), down to the Maurya period. Of the remainder, 95 Upanishads are part of the Muktika canon, composed from about the last centuries of 1st-millennium BCE through about 15th-century CE. New Upanishads, beyond the 108 in the Muktika canon, continued to be composed through the early modern and modern era, though often dealing with subjects which are unconnected to the Vedas.|$|E

5|$|The Atlantic {{campaign}} of 1806 {{was one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> complex naval campaigns of the post-Trafalgar Napoleonic Wars. Seeking {{to take advantage of the}} withdrawal of British forces from the Atlantic in the aftermath of the Battle of Trafalgar, Emperor Napoleon ordered two battle squadrons to sea from the fleet stationed at Brest, during December 1805. Escaping deep into the Atlantic, these squadrons succeeded in disrupting British convoys, evading pursuit by British battle squadrons and reinforcing the French garrison at Santo Domingo. The period of French success was brief: on 6 February 1806 one of the squadrons, under Vice-Admiral Corentin Urbain Leissègues, was intercepted by a British squadron at the Battle of San Domingo and destroyed, losing all five of its ships of the line.|$|E
5|$|The Chronic {{peaked at}} number {{three on the}} Billboard 200 and had been {{certified}} triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America with sales of 5.7 million copies in the United States, which led to Dr. Dre {{becoming one of the}} top ten best-selling American performing artists of 1993. Dr. Dre's production has been noted for popularizing the G-funk subgenre within gangsta rap. The Chronic has been widely {{regarded as one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> influential albums of the 1990s and regarded by many fans and peers to be one of the most well-produced hip hop albums of all time. The Chronic was ranked at #138 on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.|$|E
5|$|The Laguna Madre {{is one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> unspoiled lagoon {{ecosystems}} in Texas. It is {{also one}} of the most protected in the United States; 75% of its shores are protected by the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge to the west and the Padre Island National Seashore on the east. Fish, shrimp and crab, which feed the bird populations, depend on the lagoon and its plentiful beds of seagrass for survival. The seagrass of Laguna Madre accounts for 80% of all seagrass found off the Texas Coast; however, it is threatened by brown tides caused by poor circulation and dredging. An influx of seawater can sometimes replace the vital seagrass with oyster beds.|$|E

5|$|The lightest {{mendelevium}} isotopes (245Md to 247Md) {{are mostly}} produced through bombardment of bismuth targets with heavy argon ions, while slightly heavier ones (248Md to 253Md) {{are produced by}} bombarding plutonium and americium targets with lighter ions of carbon and nitrogen. The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> most stable isotopes {{are in the range}} from 254Md to 258Md and are produced through bombardment of einsteinium isotopes with alpha particles: einsteinium-253, -254, and -255 can all be used. 259Md is produced as a daughter of 259No, and 260Md can be produced in a transfer reaction between einsteinium-254 and oxygen-18. Typically, the most commonly used isotope 256Md is produced by bombarding either einsteinium-253 or -254 with alpha particles: einsteinium-254 is preferred when available because it has a longer half-life and therefore {{can be used as a}} target for longer. Using available microgram quantities of einsteinium, femtogram quantities of mendelevium-256 may be produced.|$|E

It {{is almost entirely}} {{landscaped}} including hills, a large island, a lake, ponds and a stream. The city park and other minor parks in Póvoa de Varzim were designed by Sidónio Pardal, a well-known Portuguese landscape architect. It also includes great lawn areas, rustic buildings, amphitheatres and playground structures. It is a popular place for jogging, cycling and birdwatching. It stretches from the A28 motorway to Pedreira Lake.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>and</b> {{widely used}} {{application}} of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E
