5|$|France outlawed the <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> {{political}} party, the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), on 13 July 1955. This {{prompted a}} long guerrilla {{war and the}} assassination of the party's leader, Ruben Um Nyobé. In the more peaceful British Cameroons, the question was whether to reunify with French Cameroun or join Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Jadid's {{government}} was the <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> administration in Syria's history. The coup created a permanent schism between the Syrian and Iraqi regional {{branches of the}} Ba'ath Party and their respective National Commands, with many senior Syrian Ba'athists defecting to Iraq. As {{a legacy of the}} coup, during Jadid's rule, Syria initiated a propaganda campaign against the Iraqi Ba'athists. Jadid's government would be overthrown in the Corrective Movement of 1970, which brought Hafez al-Assad to power.|$|E
5|$|Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman is the 18th-century British feminist Mary Wollstonecraft's {{unfinished}} novelistic {{sequel to}} her revolutionary political treatise A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). The Wrongs of Woman was published posthumously in 1798 by her husband, William Godwin, {{and is often}} considered her <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> feminist work.|$|E
50|$|The Ludlow Massacre in Colorado {{and police}} {{dispersal}} of the Tarrytown protests enraged <b>most</b> <b>radicals.</b> In June, {{members of the}} Lettish Anarchist Red Cross, including Berg, Hanson, Berger, and IWW member Arthur Caron began plotting a bomb attack to assassinate Rockefeller.|$|R

5|$|The {{rise of the}} Conservative Party impelled the Progressives and Historicals to unify—something {{they had}} not been able to achieve while in power. The Progressive-Historical {{coalition}} was rechristened as the Liberal Party (the third bloc bearing this name in Brazil's history). Its <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> wing would declare itself republican in 1870—an ominous signal to the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Military {{architecture}} was {{the supreme}} {{expression of the}} Ayyubid period, {{as well as an}} eagerness to fortify the restoration of Sunni Islam, especially in a previously Shia-dominated Egypt by constructing Sunni madrasas. The <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> change Saladin implemented in Egypt was the enclosure of Cairo and al-Fustat within one city wall. Some of the techniques of fortification were learned from the Crusaders, such as curtain walls following the natural topography. Many were also inherited from the Fatimids like machicolations and round towers, while other techniques were developed simultaneously by the Ayyubids, particularly concentric planning.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{modified}} extensively {{in an attempt}} to rectify their machinery problems. All three ships had their propeller shafts lengthened, and their original bronze screws were replaced with larger steel propellers, though this did not improve performance. Sebenico received the <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> alteration; her stern was lengthened slightly to allow for finer hull lines, which would improve her hydrodynamic shape, though this too failed to provide a significantly higher speed. As a result of her different hull, Sebenico is sometimes not included in the Zara class. Between 1898 and 1901, all four ships were re-boilered.|$|E
50|$|After Chirac's {{re-election}} in 2002, <b>most</b> <b>radicals</b> participated {{to the creation}} of his new party, the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). The Radical Party then quit the UDF to associate itself with the UMP, sharing its memberships and budget with the latter. Some members, however, such as Thierry Cornillet, continue to be part of UDF. It was then headed by Jean-Louis Borloo and André Rossinot.|$|R

He was elected governor in 2005 on the Civic Front for Santiago ticket, {{with the support of}} some Peronists and Socialists as well as <b>most</b> <b>Radicals</b> (UCR) in the province.|$|R
5|$|A {{design team}} {{was formed in}} 1946 under the {{leadership}} of chief designer Ronald Bishop, who had been responsible for the Mosquito fighter-bomber. A number of unorthodox configurations were considered, ranging from canard to tailless designs; all were subsequently rejected. The Ministry of Supply was, however, interested in the <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> of the proposed designs and ordered two experimental tailless DH 108s to serve as proof of concept aircraft for testing swept-wing configurations in both low-speed and high-speed flight. During flight tests, the DH 108 gained a reputation for being accident-prone and unstable, leading de Havilland and BOAC to gravitate to conventional configurations and, necessarily, designs with less technical risk. The DH 108s were later modified to test the DH 106's power controls.|$|E
5|$|Edward I died in 1307 and was {{succeeded by}} his son Edward II. The new King at first enjoyed the good will of his nobility, Valence among them. Conflict soon ensued, however, {{connected}} especially with the enormous unpopularity of Edward's favourite Piers Gaveston. Gaveston's arrogance towards the peers, and his control over Edward, united the Baronage {{in opposition to the}} King. In 1311 the initiative known as the Ordinances was introduced, severely limiting Royal powers in financial matters and in the appointment of officers. Equally important, Gaveston was expelled from the realm - as Edward I had already done once before. Pembroke, who was not among the <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> of the Ordainers, and had earlier been sympathetic with the King, had now realised the necessity of exiling Gaveston.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, reactionary {{conspiracy}} theorists, such as Scottish physicist John Robison and French Jesuit priest Augustin Barruel, began speculating that the Illuminati had survived their suppression {{and become the}} masterminds behind the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. The Illuminati were accused of being subversives who were attempting to secretly orchestrate a revolutionary wave in Europe {{and the rest of}} the world in order to spread the <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> ideas and movements of the Enlightenment—anti-clericalism, anti-monarchism, and anti-patriarchalism—and to create a world noocracy and cult of reason. During the 19th century, fear of an Illuminati conspiracy was a real concern of the European ruling classes, and their oppressive reactions to this unfounded fear provoked in 1848 the very revolutions they sought to prevent.|$|E

Until 1974 a Trotskyist group, the Proletarian Left, led by Erik Meijer, now MEP for the Socialist Party {{operated}} {{within the party}} {{because they wanted to}} use the PSP to electrify the masses. In 1974 nearly all of them (except for their leader Meijer) left the party to found what later became the group Socialist Alternative Politics. In 1975 the moderate so called progressive cooperatives left the party. Many members of them joined the PvdA.|$|R
5|$|Several {{favorite}} son candidates had delegates {{interested in their}} nomination, although they were seen as having less of a chance of gaining the nomination. Alexander Campbell had represented Illinois in the House of Representatives several years earlier. He {{was seen as a}} pragmatist who represented the Greenback Party's more conservative members. Henly James {{was the head of the}} Grange in Indiana and had served in the state legislature there, but attracted little support outside his own delegation. In the Wisconsin delegation, many favored Edward P. Allis, an industrialist who owned the Reliance Iron Works. Allis was a longtime supporter of soft money, but had no experience in elected office. Finally, Solon Chase of Maine had some support from the New England delegations. Chase was a publisher of a Greenback newspaper, Chase's Inquirer, and had narrowly lost a House election in 1878. Chase was among the <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> of the Greenbackers, attracting support from the party's left-wing members.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> {{feature of}} the {{original}} car was its use of flat plate heat exchangers mounted flush {{to the surface of}} the bodywork in place of conventional water radiators. The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the heat exchangers did not provide anything like enough cooling capacity, one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard radiators in the nose of the car, similar to that of the BT45, compromising its aerodynamic efficiency. In addition to the question of drag the nose-mounted radiators moved weight towards the front of the car.|$|E
5|$|After the {{resignation}} of the last Liberal Cabinet, PedroII invited the rival Conservative Party to form a new cabinet. With his party no longer in control, Paranhos lost much of his influence. The Liberal Party was not willing to accept its loss of power. The <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> faction of the Liberals in the province of Pernambuco, known as the Partido da Praia ("Party of the Beach"), openly advocated a rebellion. Nominally Liberal, the praieiros were associated with the Courtier Faction. The proposed rebellion would be an attempt of this branch of the Courtier Faction to regain control of the government. The praieiros had little support, and public opinion was also against them. The group was unable to convince {{the vast majority of the}} population that a revolt would bring them any benefits. On 2 February 1849, the limited uprising of the praieiros was completely defeated after attacking Recife, the capital of Pernambuco. Even though Paranhos had condemned it, the Praiera rebellion, combined with the downfalls of his patron and the Liberal Party, made a continued political career impossible. He turned his focus once again to his work in journalism.|$|E
25|$|In late September, after Ottoman troops intervened {{against the}} revolution, <b>most</b> <b>radicals</b> {{were arrested and}} transported on board small vessels on the Danube, to exile in various locations. Rosenthal made public his request to join them, but was {{answered}} that Austrian protection still applied to him, and, although he requested {{to be viewed as}} a Wallachian, was denied permission to board. Subsequently, he and Rosetti's wife Maria followed the ships on shore from Giurgiu to Sviniţa, where they convinced the Austrian mayor to disarm the Ottoman guards, and allow the prisoners to go free.|$|R
40|$|Free-radical {{metabolites}} can {{be generated}} metabolically by a one-electron reductase-catalyzed reaction or a "peroxidase" catalyzed oxidation or by photoactivation {{of a wide variety}} of aromatic xenobiotics. Radicals may also be generated during lipid peroxidation. Some radicals can react with DNA or bind covalently or noncovalently as a dismutation product or as a dimer, trimer or polymeric product. Modification to the DNA can result in single-strand breaks, loss of template activity, and crosslinking. The binding can prevent enzymic digestion. In some cases, the radicals react with oxygen, resulting before conversion to DNA reactive oxygen species. <b>Most</b> <b>radicals</b> probably do not interact with DNA...|$|R

5|$|During {{this period}} Delius did not confine himself to purely orchestral works; he {{produced}} his final opera, Fennimore and Gerda (1908–10), like A Village Romeo and Juliet written in tableau form, {{but in his}} mature style. His choral works of the period, notably An Arabesque (1911) and A Song of the High Hills (1911) are among the <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> of Delius's writings in their juxtapositions of unrelated chords. The latter work, entirely wordless, contains {{some of the most}} difficult choral music in existence, according to Heseltine. After 1915, Delius turned his attention to traditional sonata, chamber and concerto forms, which he had largely left alone since his apprentice days. Of these pieces Payne highlights two: the Violin Concerto (1916), as an example of how, writing in unfamiliar genres, Delius remained stylistically true to himself; and the Cello Sonata of 1917, which, lacking the familiarity of an orchestral palate, becomes a melodic triumph. Cardus's verdict, however, is that Delius's chamber and concerto works are largely failures. After 1917, according to Payne, there was a general deterioration in {{the quantity and quality of}} Delius's output as illness took hold, although Payne exempts the incidental music to Hassan (1920–23) from condemnation, believing it to contain some of Delius's best work.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round of the civil war between {{grandfather}} and grandson, Andronikos III was successful in getting recognition for himself as junior emperor, with Thrace as his personal appanage. Throughout the conflict, Synadenos was among the <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> and uncompromising supporters of the younger Andronikos, favouring the eventual deposition of Andronikos II. During the course of the war, Synadenos defeated loyalist forces under Constantine Asen, and in the final round of the civil war, in 1327–28, he served as governor in Thrace. As more and more localities, including the Empire's second-most important city, Thessalonica, switched over to Andronikos III's camp, Synadenos along with Kantakouzenos urged Andronikos III to march on Constantinople and depose his grandfather outright. On the night of 13 May 1328, the three men led their army through a gate after bribing its guard, taking possession of the imperial capital without resistance. Andronikos II was forced to resign the throne and retire to a monastery, with his grandson succeeding him as sole emperor. For his services, Synadenos was promoted to protostrator sometime during the civil war, perhaps as early as 1321.|$|E
5|$|Jadid's {{government}} {{has been referred to}} as Syria's <b>most</b> <b>radical</b> government in history. He initiated rash and radical policies internally and externally, and tried to overturn Syrian society from the top to the bottom. While Assad and Jadid agreed ideologically, they did not agree on how to implement these beliefs in practice. The Military Committee, which had been the officers' key decision-making process during 1963–66, lost its central institutional authority under Jadid because the fight against the Aflaqites was over – the key reason for the committee's existence in the first place. While Jadid never acquired, or took the offices of Prime Minister or President, instead opting to rule through the office of Assistant Secretary of the Regional Command, he was the undisputed ruler of Syria from 1966 to 1970. Before the 1966 coup, Jadid had controlled the Syrian armed forces through his post as Head of the Bureau of Officers' Affairs, but from 1966 onwards Jadid became absorbed with running the country, and in his place, Assad was given the task of controlling the armed forces. This would later prove to be a mistake, and lead to Jadid's downfall in the 1970 Corrective Revolution.|$|E
