25|$|The Philadelphian cricketing {{establishment}} had {{strict rules}} for maintaining an American feel in their cricket. Wood {{was not allowed}} to play on the representative Philadelphian cricket team until he had satisfied a 5-year residency requirement. In 1881 Wood accepted at offer to coach the Belmont Cricket Club and took a position with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in Philadelphia in 1882. Though he had come to Philadelphia to manage and play for Belmont, his first-class debut in Philadelphia was between the American born cricketers in the city and those Englishmen that were resident there. Playing for the English Residents, Wood scored only 5 runs in the match and his side lost. He played in this match each year until 1884 when he first played against the Philadelphians with the rest of America. He scored 32 runs in the second innings of this loss. His debut for the Philadelphian side came on 5 September 1892 against the remaining US players. In this <b>match,</b> <b>Wood</b> led his new team with a career high 182 runs before being stumped. The Philadelphian side won by an innings and 281 runs. He played {{for the next five years}} against touring foreign sides before joining the Philadelphians on their tour of England in 1897. He also took part in the tours of 1903 and 1908. Wood died in Philadelphia on 25 August 1947.|$|E

50|$|Bradley Wood is a combative {{player who}} was {{promoted}} to the club's first team squad midway through the 2008-09 season as a makeshift defender from the youth team. He was named as a substitute once for The Mariners. In the 2009-10 season, Wood did not receive a squad number until his club fell victim to an injury crisis which saw him named as a substitute in the away defeat against Port Vale. On 26 September Wood made his first team debut playing from the start against Darlington in place of regular right back Robbie Stockdale. The match finished 1-1 with Wood putting in a very impressive debut at right back and winning Man of the <b>Match.</b> <b>Wood</b> continued this role filling in for the injured Stockdale, and also played as a makeshift left back {{in the place of}} Joe Widdowson on the odd occasion.|$|E

40|$|The {{matching}} of wood {{species to}} specific railroad operating and environmental conditions {{has long been}} recognized as a desirable goal in optimizing the use of wood cross-ties in track. In fact, several North American railroads currently use a limited form of species segregation {{in an attempt to}} <b>match</b> <b>wood</b> performance and operating and environmental conditions. However, to date, this species segregation has been subjective in nature, based on the identification of certain species for certain limited use applications. This papers presents the results of a Railway Tie Association sponsored program to develop an objective Tie Usage Index {{that can be used to}} assist railroads in defining usage environments and matching the usage environment (both environmental and mechanical) with wood type and performance (e. g. species). This in turn leads to the application of this Tie Usage Index as a basis for defining species usage on a railroad as a function of service environment and geographical location. The Tie Usage Index presented in this paper is based on a set of specific numerical criterion (“indices”) that can be used to define where different timber species can be installed. The Tie Usage Index includes the following specific behaviors and effects: • Susceptibility to environmental decay, such as defined by a decay hazard index • Susceptibility to mechanical damage such as defined by curvature and annual traffic density (annual MGT) and grade. The paper further presents a detailed listing of wood species that can be used for cross-ties, divides these species into 22 categories of similarly performing wood species and develops a preliminary ranking of these species based on performance. Finally, the paper relates these 22 categories to railroad usage environment (both mechanical and environmental) and presents preliminary recommendations for use of the different wood specie categories as a function of the Tie Usage Index...|$|E

50|$|Balete tree (also {{known as}} balite or baliti) are {{several species of}} {{the trees in the}} Philippines from the genus Ficus that are broadly {{referred}} to as balete in the local language. A number of these are known as strangler figs wherein they start upon other trees, later entrapping them entirely and finally killing the host tree. Also called hemiepiphytes, initially, they start as epiphytes or air plants and grow several hanging roots that eventually touch the ground and from then on, encircling and suffocating the host tree. Some of the baletes produce an inferior quality of rubber. The India rubber plant, F. elastica were earlier cultivated to some extent for rubber. Some of the species like tangisang-bayawak or Ficus variegata are large and could probably be utilized for <b>match</b> <b>woods.</b> The woods of species of Ficus are soft, light, and of inferior quality, and the trees usually have ill-formed, short boles.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In kiln drying of {{high value}} grade {{softwood}} timber, kiln brown stain (KBS) {{is a major}} drying defect and induces significant loss. In this work, {{research has been conducted}} to dry radiata pine sapwood in alternative oxygen-free drying medium in order to produce bright coloured wood in kiln drying of softwood timber. In the experiment, samples were dried in a newly designed experiment rig by using methanol or ethanol vapours, respectively, at drying temperatures of 90, 100 and 110 °C. For comparison, the <b>matched</b> <b>wood</b> samples were also dried in hot air in a tunnel dryer using the same temperatures. The results showed that no obvious KBS were detected on the surface of sample boards when being dried in either the methanol vapour or the ethanol vapour at all of the temperatures tested. However, for hot air drying, KBS was obviously observed. These results indicate that using an alternative oxygen-free medium to dry wood could be an effective way for preventing surface discolouration...|$|R

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{selective}} removal of extractives on termite or decay resistance was assessed with matched samples of Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don and Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D.Don) Spach heartwood. Samples were extracted {{using a variety}} of solvents and then exposed to the subterranean termite Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki in a no-choice feeding test or to the brown-rot fungus Postia placenta (Fr.) M. Larsen & Lombard in a soil bottle test. At the same time, the effect of naturally occurring variations in heartwood extractives on termite or decay resistance was evaluated by testing samples from the inner and outer heartwood of five trees of each species against C. formosanus and P. placenta and analyzing <b>matched</b> <b>wood</b> samples for their extractive content. The results suggest that the methanol-soluble extractives in T. plicata and C. nootkatensis {{play an important role in}} heartwood resistance to attack by C. formosanus and P. placenta. Total methanol-soluble extractive content of the heartwood was positively correlated with both termite and decay resistance; however, there was much unexplained variation and levels of individual extractive components were only weakly correlated with one another. Further studies are under way to develop a better understanding of the relationships between individual extractive levels and performance.|$|R
