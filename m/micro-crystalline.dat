It has been recommended for medicinal use by alternative medicine sites, in doses of 2 to 4 grains (0.1 to 0.25 grams), as a bitter tonic and aperient.

50|$|The Goa powder or araroba is {{contained}} in the trunk, filling crevices in the heartwood. It is a morbid product in the tree, and yields to hot chloroform 50% of a substance known officially as chrysarobin. It occurs as a <b>micro-crystalline,</b> odorless, tasteless powder, very slightly soluble in either water or alcohol; it also occurs in rhubarb root. This complex mixture contains pure chrysarobin, di-chrysarobin methylether, di-chrysarobin. Chrysarobin is a methyl trioxyanthracene and exists as a glucoside in the plant, but is gradually oxidized to chrysophanic acid (a dioxy-methyl anthraquinone) and glucose. This strikes a blood-red color in alkaline solutions, and may therefore cause much alarm if administered to a patient whose urine is alkaline. The British pharmacopoeia has an ointment containing one part of chrysarobin and 24 of benzoated lard.|$|E
5000|$|Soot is {{composed}} of a complex mixture of organic compounds which are weakly absorbing in the visible spectral region and a highly absorbing black component which is variously called “elemental”, “graphitic” or “black carbon”.

[...] The term black carbon is used to imply that this soot component is primarily responsible for the absorption of visible light. [...] The term black carbon is used as a synonym for both the elemental and graphitic component of soot. It can be measured using different types of devices based on absorption or dispersion of a light beam or derived from noise measurements.|$|E
50|$|Although {{anodizing}} {{produces a}} very regular and uniform coating, microscopic fissures in the coating {{can lead to}} corrosion. Further, the coating is susceptible to chemical dissolution {{in the presence of}} high- and low-pH chemistry, which results in stripping the coating and corrosion of the substrate. To combat this, various techniques have been developed either {{to reduce the number of}} fissures, to insert more chemically stable compounds into the oxide, or both. For instance, sulfuric-anodized articles are normally sealed, either through hydro-thermal sealing or precipitating sealing, to reduce porosity and interstitial pathways that allow corrosive ion exchange between the surface and the substrate. Precipitating seals enhance chemical stability but are less effective in eliminating ion exchange pathways. Most recently, new techniques to partially convert the amorphous oxide coating into more stable <b>micro-crystalline</b> compounds have been developed that have shown significant improvement based on shorter bond lengths.|$|E
