40|$|In this article, {{we explore}} how corpus-based {{techniques}} can broaden {{our understanding of}} how lexical and grammatical features help to shape and define the persuasive features of philanthropic direct <b>mail</b> <b>letters</b> by allowing us to examine the patterns of dozens of linguistic features across a large number of texts. Using 316 direct <b>mail</b> <b>letters</b> from 108 organizations across five philanthropic fields, we use a multidimensional analysis technique, developed by Biber (1988), to develop a linguistic profile of the genre. This profile is based on five linguistic "dimensions " that are determined by which of 67 linguistics features typically co-occur. Based on the assumption that linguistic features do not randomly co-occur in texts but in fact together serve a functional purpose, these dimensions can be used to show how genres vary, as reflected by their use of different linguistic features, in order to accomplish generic goals. Our findings show that philanthropic direct <b>mail</b> <b>letters</b> are indeed a unique genre, displaying a pattern of linguistic features that are quite distinct from other common genres. 1...|$|R
