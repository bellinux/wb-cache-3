40|$|Organotin {{compounds}} are variously used industrial chemicals. One of {{the most}} toxicological relevant compounds is tributyltin (TBT). TBT {{has been used as}} an effective component in antifouling paints for decades. Thus, it is set free into the water column in considerable amounts and affects also non-target organismens in very low concentrations. Molluscs like snails and mussels are particularly sensitive and reproduction can be influenced significantly thereby. Once released into the water column, TBT accumulates in sediments and will remain there beyond years due to its high persistence. Several guideline values, target levels and quality standards were specified for TBT, its degradation products <b>monobutyltin</b> (<b>MBT)</b> and dibutyltin (DBT) as well as for other organotin compounds in sediments [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of butyltin compounds was investigated {{for the first}} time in selected lakes, rivers and coastal environments of China. Aqueous samples were pretreated by the technique of headspace solid phase micro-extraction after hydride generation with sodium tetrahydroborate (NaBH(4)). Quantitative measurement of tributyltin (TBT), dibutyltin (DBT) and <b>monobutyltin</b> (<b>MBT)</b> concentrations were accomplished by capillary gas chromatography with flame photometric detector using quartz surface-induced luminescence. Experimental data demonstrated the widespread occurrence of butyltin compounds in the Chinese aquatic environment. In some locations, the concentrations of TBT were higher than the acute and chronic toxicity threshold of sensitive fresh water or marine organisms. Although DBT and MBT (which mainly come from the degradation of TBT), are less toxic, their occurrence can still affect the ecosystem over a long time frame. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The {{effect of}} organotin {{compounds}} and copper, commonly used as antifouling agent, were studied on Mercenaria mercernaria larvae. They were reared under usual hatchery conditions {{until they reached}} 190 um in diameter. The larvae were subjected to four compounds, tributylin chloride (TBT), <b>monobutyltin</b> chloride (<b>MBT),</b> trimethyltin chloride (TMT), cupric sulfate (CuSo 4) plus control. Mortality was measured at 24, 48 h, and 96 h. Behavioral and/or metamorphic changes were recorded in triplicate at 24 - 48 and 96 h. The appearance in swimming larvae of a functional foot was considered a sign of competence to set and was recorded as a "pediveliger". Swimming larvae were considered as larvae {{that have not yet}} reached their total development and they were recorded as "swimming". Larvae that did not show foot or swimming activity and were static but alive on the bottom were recorded as "bottom". TBT was found to completely inhibit swimming activity at sublethal concentrations throughout the period of observation. Copper and MBT inhibited swimming from 48 h, TMT did not inhibit swimming activity at any of the times recorded. The four compounds ranked in order of decreasing toxicity were TBT>TMT>CU>MBT. ...|$|R
40|$|Butyltins in sediments and biota {{collected}} from the Pearl River Delta, South China were analyzed by a gas chromatograph-atomic emission detector (GC-AED). The concentrations of tributyltin (TBT) in the sediments ranged from 1. 7 to 379. 7 ng/g dry weight. Their spatial distribution suggested that shipping activities, especially shipyards were mostly responsible for the TBT contamination in the region. A good linear relationship was observed between the DBT (dibutyltin) /TBT and <b>MBT</b> (<b>monobutyltin)</b> /TBT ratios of the samples in the Pearl River, the Pearl River estuary and the West River, suggesting that TBT in these areas came from similar sources but had undergone a different extent of degradation.

40|$|Grain-size {{partitioning}} of tributyltin (TBT) and its {{degradation products}} di- and <b>monobutyltin</b> (DBT and <b>MBT)</b> in coastal sediments revealed a strong tendency {{on the part}} of these compounds to adsorb on to detrital fragments (algal and leaf debris mixed with light mineral particles). Butyltins have been weakly detected in sands washed from these debris, a finding which underlined the need to separate both fractions (sands and debris) for an accurate assessment of the grain size partitioning. In debris-free sediments, butyltins were mostly detected in the silt/clay fraction. It was found necessary to consider the total amount of butyltins in each fraction, and hence the relative proportion of each fraction, in order accurately to assess the grain-size partitioning of these compounds. At this stage however, it was difficult to determine whether butyltins were only adsorbed on the surface of particles (high adsorption capacities in organic debris and silt/clays) or strongly bound to organic matter...|$|R

Although significant losses of tributyltin (TBT, 90 %), dibutyltin (DBT, 100 %) and <b>monobutyltin</b> (<b>MBT,</b> 80 %) were detected in standard solutions prepared in methanol following gamma-irradiation, no species inter-conversion occurred. Some degradation of TBT (38 %) and DBT (32 %) but no significant change in MBT content was found using a spiked sediment CRM HISS- 1. Conversion DBT to MBT in spiked HISS- 1 was deduced. Much smaller degradation of TBT (16 % loss) and 10 % loss of DBT by conversion to MBT (14 % gain) was registered using a sediment blend of PACS- 2 and HISS- 1 (SOPH). Despite some initial losses of TBT and DBT due to irradiation, better than 2 % RSD in both TBT and DBT concentrations measured in twelve different bottles of blended sediment SOPH were obtained, indicating the material may be considered homogeneous for these analytes. Results from a long-term five-year stability study of PACS- 2 show that all three butyltins are stable during storage at 4 degrees C followed with 2. 5 Mrad minimum dose of gamma-irradiation sterilization treatment.

40|$|International audienceFifty four {{sediment}} {{samples and}} three pooled samples of whole three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculleatus) collected from four marinas located along the south-western {{coast of the}} Gulf of Gdansk, Baltic Sea, Poland, were examined for butyltins (BTs) i. e., tributyltin (TBT), dibutyltin (DBT) and <b>monobutyltin</b> (<b>MBT),</b> to understand the degree of pollution and distribution pattern. Total butyltin concentrations in sediments from the marina {{of the city of}} Gdynia ranged between 130 and 20000 ng Sn/g dry wt. with a mean value of 2900 ng Sn/g. In sediments collected from the marinas located {{in the area of the}} Brave Vistula River Channel BT concentrations ranged between 10 to 15000 ng Sn/g dry wt. with a mean values between 500 and 5500 ng Sn/g, and the innermost sites of each of four marinas were the most polluted. The mean BT concentrations in three-spined stickleback were between 1500 and 3100 ng Sn/g wet wt. and the values followed mean concentrations noted in sediments from the corresponding marina. The pleasure yachts are identified as the main source of BT pollution of sediment and fish. Tributyltin was a major form of BTs present in sediments (between 24 and 43 %) and in three-spined stickleback (between 54 and 70 %), suggesting a very recent use of marine paints containing TBT in pleasure yachts. Evidently at the Polish coast of the Baltic Sea TBT was continuously used in 1997 in marine paints for boats less then 25 m long...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{changes in}} environmental indicators of tributyltin (TBT) and its decomposition products (dibutyltin, DBT; <b>monobutyltin,</b> <b>MBT)</b> since imposition of controlling regulations in 1989. Indicators include: 1. sediment and pore water concentrations; and 2. imposex occurrence and severity in neogastropod whelks. Data represent {{studies conducted in}} the Strait of Georgia, {{the west coast of}} Vancouver I., and three major contiguous harbors (Vancouver, Victoria, Esquimalt) since 1987 and features recent work since 2000. It has been said that the tributyltin cation is probably the most toxic chemical that has ever been deliberately introduced into the aquatic environment (Maguire 2000). Indeed, {{it is one of the}} few man-made compounds for which there is a direct, well-established connection between it and its effects. Key sublethal effects include masculinization of neogastropod whelks, inhibition of growth and shell deformation in oysters, immunosuppression in flounder, and bioaccumulation in many aquatic species (for examples, see Shimasaki et al. 2003; Waldock et al. 1983; Salazar and Salazar 1987; Gibbs and Bryan 1986). Acute toxicity occurs at very low concentrations, often at low ng. L- 1 concentrations. In 1989, Canada, in concert with may other countries, introduced new regulations to control the use of TBT-based antifouling paints (CAPCO 1990). Under these controls, TBT-based paints were permitted on hulls greater than 25 meters long and maximum leach rates for permitted paints were required to be 4 µg. cm- 2. d- 1.

40|$|Two microalgal species, Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella sp., {{which showed}} high {{tributyltin}} (TBT) tolerant ability were investigated for their capabilities in degrading TBT at sublethal concentration. The distribution of TBT and its degraded products dibutyltin (DBT) and <b>monobutyltin</b> (<b>MBT)</b> in the incubation medium, extracellular surface and intracellular fraction were monitored during an exposure period of 14 days. Results showed that biosorption of TBT by the algal cell wall {{was the major}} mechanism in reducing 40 % of the initial TBT from the medium in the first 2 days. The half-life of TBT incubated with C. vulgaris was 60 h while that of Chlorella sp. was 80 h. The occurrence of DBT at Day 1 in the culture medium provided direct evidence to the biodegradation of TBT by both Chlorella species. At {{the end of the}} experimental period, 27 and 41 % of the original TBT were recovered as DBT and MBT in cultures of C. vulgaris, respectively. In contrast, DBT appeared to be the only degradation product of Chlorella sp. and only 26 % of the original TBT was transformed to DBT. Despite the same genus, TBT was debutylated to a greater extent to MBT by C. vulgaris, while DBT was the end degradation product by Chlorella sp. The capability of such debutylating process therefore accounted for the higher tolerant ability of C. vulgaris than Chlorella sp. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of organotin compounds in bivalves collected from Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia was studied {{in order to}} examine the present status of contamination on marine environment. The bivalves such as clams Meretrix spp., green mussels Perna viridis, and arkshells Anadara granosa and A. antiquata were purchased at each local market or collected from each coast. Six organotin compounds, <b>monobutyltin</b> (<b>MBT),</b> dibutyltin (DBT), tributyltin (TBT), monophenyltin (MPT), diphenyltin (DPT) and triphenyltin (TPT) were analyzed in these samples using GC-MS. Concentrations of TBT in bivalves specimens collected from Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia were in the range of 0. 37 - 56 ngg^ wet wt., 0. 83 - 16 ngg^ wet wt. and 9. 737 ngg^ wet wt., respectively. Among 12 Vietnamese sites, average concentration of TBT (47 ngg^ wet wt.) in clams from Cua Luc was the highest level, and the ratio of TBT to ΣBTs in this site was 86 %. As Cua Luc is an industrial town having large international trading port, continuous input of TBT from vessels might be indicated. Concentrations of MPT in clams from Vietnam ranged from 0. 16 to 11 ngg^ wet wt., and those of DPT and TPT in clams from Vietnam and MPT, DPT and TPT in bivalves from Thailand and Indonesia were close to the detection limit. The present study indicated that organotin compounds in bivalves from Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia were fallen in the range of levels reported throughout the world...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} {{and species}} of organotin compounds (OTCs) in 52 surface sediment samples from nine fishing ports along the Chinese coast were studied. Butyltins (BTs) and phenyltins (PhTs) were derivatized using sodium tetraethylborate (NaBEt 4) and determined by head-space solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) gas chromatography {{coupled with a}} flame photometric detector (GC-FPD). The concentrations of OTCs ranged from < 3. 6 to 194 ng (Sn) g- 1 dry weight (dw) for <b>monobutyltin</b> (<b>MBT),</b> < 2. 3 to 41. 5 ng (Sn) g- 1 dw for dibutyltin (DBT), < 0. 7 to 86. 0 ng (Sn) g- 1 dw for tributyltin (TBT) and < 5. 1 to 66. 1 ng (Sn) g- 1 dw for monophenyltin (MPhT), respectively. The concentrations of diphenyltin (DPhT) and triphenyltin (TPhT) were below the limit of detection (LOD). BTs were the main species in the sediments except for the samples collected from Shazikou fishing port in Qingdao. The concentrations of MBT were higher than DBT and TBT. The concentrations of OTCs in the sediments varied widely among different sampling locations. The concentrations of BTs were much higher in the samples collected from fishing ports close to the South China Sea than those in coast of the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea. MPhT was prevalent in most sampling stations except for those in coast of the East China Sea. The environmental and ecotoxicological risks of TBT in most sediment samples were low.

40|$|A novel method using {{capillary}} electrophoresis (CE) coupled with {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for the separation of four organotin compounds has been developed. Semi-permanent coating of dioctadecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC) was applied and investigated to enhance separation efficiency of trimethyltin (TMT) chloride, tributyltin (TBT) chloride, dibutyltin (DBT) dichloride and <b>monobutyltin</b> (<b>MBT)</b> trichloride. The electrolyte composition and ionic strength were optimized. Running buffer containing 0. 608 mol L(- 1) HAc and 7 mmol L(- 1) NaAc was selected for the separation. The detection limits of the four organotin compounds ranged from 0. 037 to 0. 112 mg L(- 1) (as Sn) and {{the values of the}} relative standard deviation (RSD) were below 3. 1 % for migration time, less than 7. 8 % for peak height and not more than 8. 4 % for peak area. The developed method was successfully applied for speciation analysis of four organotin compounds in one certified reference material (CRM 477, mussel tissue), and environmental samples including water samples, grape wine and biological samples (Mya arenaria Linnaeus). The determined values (as organotin compounds) of CRM 477 (1. 81 +/- 0. 13 (TBT), 1. 36 +/- 0. 16 (DBT), 1. 17 +/- 0. 18 (MBT)) were in good agreement with the certified values (2. 20 +/- 0. 19 (TBT), 1. 54 +/- 0. 12 (DBT), 1. 50 +/- 0. 28 (MBT)). 0. 325 mg L(- 1) MBT and 1. 02 mu g g(- 1), (as Sn) TBT were found in grape wine and Mya arenaria Linnaeus samples...|$|E
30|$|Monitoring {{bioaccumulation}} {{can also}} support risk assessment of various natural or anthropogenic {{events such as}} floods or dredging activities. For the maintenance of waterways, dredging of sediments may be necessary. As an example, the amount of sediments had increased to an unacceptable level in the Hamburg Port in 2004. In consequence, 6.5  Mio.[*]m 3 of sediments were dredged from the lower Elbe river in the Hamburg Port area and disposed 25  km north-west of the island Scharhörn in the inner German Bight between 2005 and 2010. To assess the potential ecological impacts on the marine environment, a comprehensive monitoring program has been established [43]. Among many other parameters, bioaccumulation of metals and organic chemicals has been measured in two benthic invertebrates (mussels (white furrow shell, Abra alba) and snails (common whelk, Buccinum undatum)) and fish (dab, Limanda limanda) sampled {{in and around the}} disposal site as well as in reference sites. These species were selected since they are abundant in the monitoring area and they represent different trophic levels. Since 2008, significantly increased levels of the organotin compounds <b>monobutyltin</b> (<b>MBT)</b> and dibutyltin (DBT) were detected in snails from the disposal site hinting at an increased bioavailability of contaminants due to the sediment disposals. Indeed, bioaccumulation decreased again after cessation of the disposals in 2010 : concentrations of the DDT metabolites p,p′-DDD and p,p′-DDE that had increased in snails sampled at the disposal site attained the same level as in reference sites in 2011. Sediment disposals had, in contrast to snails, no clear effect on concentrations of chemicals in fish and mussels. This shows that the selection of monitoring species can influence the outcome of monitoring studies.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{female and}} male Thais clavigera whelks were exposed to aqueous and dietary (using oysteis as the prey) {{tributyltin}} gm for up to 45 days. followed by a 30 -day depuration, {{in order to examine}} the gender differences in TBT accumulation and transformation The metabolites of TBT [dibutyltin (DBT) and <b>monobutyltin</b> (<b>MBT)</b> ] were also measured in different tissues of the whelks (digestive, reproductive and remaining organs) during the exposure and depuration periods By the end of the exposure period. all of the female whelks developed imposex after TBT exposure, and both the relative penis size index and the vas deferens sequence index were positively correlated with the tissue burden of TBT However, biomagnification of TBT did not occur in the whelks. TBT was rapidly accumulated in their digestive and reproductive organs from both routes of exposure, and both elimination and biotransformation of TBT were also rapid The redistribution of TBT among tissues was obvious during the exposure period but negligible during depuration MBT was generally the major metabolite in each tissue, indicating a significant metabolism of TBT by the whelks Accumulation, transformation, as well as elimination, were more significant following dietary exposure than following aqueous exposure In particular, we observed gender-related differences in the biokinetics of TBT Rapid biotransformation and elimination of TBT were detected in the male whelks, while the female whelks had higher bioaccumulation but lower elimination of TBT in their reproductive organs Internal remobilization of TBT from digestive to reproductive organs was also more obvious in the females, indicating that the reproductive organs of females were the main targets of TBT accumulation (C) 2010 Elsevier B.
