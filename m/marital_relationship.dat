40|$|Using a national-level US {{homicide}} {{database that}} {{includes more than}} 400, 000 homicides committed from 1976 - 1994, I calculated rates of uxoricide (the murder of a woman by her romantic partner) by type of <b>relationship</b> (cohabiting or <b>marital),</b> ages of the partners, and age difference between partners. Women in cohabiting relationships are about nine {{times more likely to}} be killed by their partner than are women in <b>marital</b> <b>relationships.</b> Within <b>marital</b> <b>relationships,</b> the risk of uxori-cide decreases with a woman’s age. Within cohabiting relationships, in contrast, middle-aged women are at greatest risk of uxoricide. Paralleling the uxoricide victimization rates, uxoricide perpetra-tion rates are highest for young married men and for middle-aged cohabiting men. Uxoricide risk generally increases with greater age difference between partners. These findings provide the first national-level replication of uxoricide risk patterns reported for a national-level Canadian sample.

[...] "I {{do not know the}} child," [...] Potter wrote, [...] "She is the school friend of a little cousin, who asked for it as a favour, and the name took my fancy."

40|$|Background and Aim: Despite {{growing body}} of {{literature}} regarding marital adjustment of infertile women, to our knowledge, there is no study to address the role of religious and spiritual beliefs in adjusting <b>marital</b> <b>relationships</b> in infertile women. Considering the significance of marital cohesiveness and commitment in the long and stressful journey of infertile women, {{this study was designed}} to explore how <b>marital</b> <b>relationships</b> are experienced by infertile women who affiliated to different religious faiths. Methods: A group of 30 infertile women affiliated to different denominations of Christianity (Protestantism, Catholicism, Orthodoxies) and Islam (Shiite and Sunni) were interviewed. The design was a grounded theory study including semi structured in-depth interviews. Data were collected in one Iranian and two UK fertility clinics through theoretical sampling and analyzed using Strauss and Corbin’s mode of grounded theory.  Results: Religious infertile women using a religious/spiritual meaning-making framework tried adjust their <b>marital</b> <b>relationships</b> through going the following phases: being optimistic and positive, having supportive relationships, being grateful and appreciated for their marital life, offering spiritual sympathy and adopting religious role models. These strategies aided infertile women to be more understanding, sympathetic and gentle towards maintaining the family cohesion. Conclusion: I argue that awareness of health professionals of the potential ways in which religion and spirituality assist infertile women to deal with their marital issues could be important. This knowledge will help them to support emotional wholeness and integrity of infertile women, offering religious and spiritual coping strategies which can help adjusting their <b>marital</b> <b>relationships.</b> ...|$|R
