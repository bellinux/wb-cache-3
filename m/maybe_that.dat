5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> will help.|$|E

Anarky as a character—and as a broader idea—is much more radical than Ollie." ...|$|E

500|$|When he was twenty, the National Post {{described}} Raonic as a [...] "hothead whose on-court demeanour {{was holding}} him back." [...] As he grew older, commentators {{came to see}} him as [...] "stoic", [...] "robotic", and [...] "emotionless", with The Daily Telegraph referring to him as [...] "an analytical character who questions everything he does in practice". In 2014, Raonic explained: [...] "I'm the son of two engineers, so everything is a numbers and calculation game." [...] In 2016, he added: [...] "I am very systematic in how [...] need to go about things to bring out the best tennis for myself, and <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> comes off as mechanical and robotic and those kind of things, but I don't know if I'd ever change that because I feel that's the way I get the best out of myself when it comes to my tennis." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Star quoted Rowland on {{the theme}} of the song. She said [...] "I hope to see women singing the song like they're in charge. It's {{important}} to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny." [...] Love explained to Rap-Up magazine his view of the song, [...] "It's just such an aggressive record, it's a club record, it's a worldwide international record. She's stretching her legs out and she's showing her true vocal ability, she's like the queen of the night on this record." [...] Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said [...] "I feel like I've finally come into my own," [...] a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound. [...] "With the sound of dance music getting embraced more, I'm very excited, seeing how fans have been responding to the music. Dance music is more of a European thing, but I've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans (in different parts of the country) talking about playing 'Commander'." [...] She said working with Guetta was [...] "amazing" [...] because it is [...] "effortless" [...] and she feels a great sense of [...] "chemistry" [...] when working with him. Rowland felt she was trying something different: [...] "In this generation and this day and time, no one is putting soul in dance music... no pop artist. I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> was something I could try. And then it works." [...] In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material but still fun. [...] "I just thought it'd be so much fun to be a commander of course. It's just a statement for me definitely, coming out on my own, filling my space. I'm happy being a commander".|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} soundtrack by David Schwartz {{does not}} include any songs by the Beatles because [...] "the producers could not get clearance from the notoriously difficult copyright holders, a company owned by Michael Jackson."

2500|$|At {{least two}} {{variants}} {{of a conspiracy}} theory about the massacre have been promoted. Interviewed in 2006, Tony Rundle, Premier of Tasmania from 1996 to 1998, admitted that, {{because there was no}} trial, the evidence made public was possibly insufficient to support that Bryant had been the gunman: [...] "At the time, the view was that a trial could do no good for the victims and their families. Now I think <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> wasn't the case. If all the evidence was heard, then maybe it would have provided some closure and stopped the proliferation of conspiracy theories that sprang up over the years." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2002 {{interview}} with Anthony DeCurtis, Tweedy noted that, {{of all of}} the songs that Uncle Tupelo recorded throughout their career, [...] "Sandusky" [...] holds a special place for him:"Sandusky" [...] is probably the track that I'm most proud of. [...] It's an instrumental, it was a real collaboration and it just kind of came out of us in the studio, real improvised natural music, very simple. I think it's beautiful. [...] I also don't feel I was that much a part of it, because it just happened, and <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> makes it easier to listen to it. That's the one that sticks out in my mind the most.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{scheduling}} {{conflicts with}} other projects (Moore {{had to travel}} to different places such as London or New York, and Levi could only record on weekends for five hours once every six weeks), they did not necessarily record dialogue {{in the same order}} as in the final film. [...] ", <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> sequence or scene had been recorded by Mandy (Moore) already, maybe it hadn't. We'd end up doing the same scene five times, depending," [...] Levi said. After watching the finished film, Moore was disappointed because she felt that her voice sounded [...] "shrill", while Levi thought that his performance sounded [...] "incredibly nasally".|$|E
2500|$|Atwater: You {{start out}} in 1954 by saying, [...] "Nigger, nigger, nigger". By 1968 you can't say [...] "nigger"—that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights {{and all that}} stuff. You're getting so {{abstract}} now [...] you're talking about cutting taxes, {{and all these things}} you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [...] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me—because obviously sitting around saying, [...] "We want to cut this", is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and {{a hell of a lot}} more abstract than [...] "Nigger, nigger".|$|E
2500|$|Todd Akin, {{a long-time}} anti-abortion activist, {{served as a}} Republican member of the House of Representatives for Missouri's 2nd congressional {{district}} from 2001 until 2013. On August 7, 2012, Akin won the Republican primary to become his party's nominee for the U.S. Senate election in Missouri. On August 19, Akin said that victims of what he termed [...] "legitimate rape" [...] rarely become pregnant. He said this during an interview aired on the St. Louis television station KTVI-TV when asked whether women who are raped and become pregnant should {{have the option of}} abortion. He replied:Well you know, people always want to try to make that as one of those things, well how do you, how do you slice this particularly tough sort of ethical question. First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume that <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> didn't work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{response}} to some early negative reactions to the actress' performance, Jon Lachonis noted {{in a review of}} the first season's seventh episode that [...] "Anna Torv, whose chill portrayal of FBI agent and Pattern investigator Olivia Dunham has come under fire for being too wooden, seems to have reinvented her character to answer the critics. The good news is, Anna's new and more animated Olivia isn't really a departure so much as it is a character who seems to have had a catharsis. She is comfortable in her skin now, and the stillness is pulled back in favor of more humanity. Of course, it is helpful that she reunites with an old beau in this episode - if there is one thing Fringe is totally lacking it is sexual tension." [...] Executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman defended Torv's early Fringe work in a 2011 interview, explaining the character was designed to be [...] "bland, because of her conditioning as a child and everything she's been through. Now, one can argue that <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> wasn't the best way for us to introduce the main character, but there was a purpose. So Anna had to listen to all these people saying 'She's really doing nothing,' when really it was our issue. We didn't write anything for her because... well, now you know why. But at the time, people were like, 'Wow, this girl really is not much,' which is so not true. Anna was just so professional, and so great. She did it with excellence, and now she's really getting the chance to show people, 'Hey, I'm a really hard worker and a terrific actor.' We're so thankful that people can start to see her for who she really is. Midway through the second season, Sarah Stegall from SFScope believed Torv [...] "had the most progress and the most satisfying development" [...] of all the main actors, stating she [...] "is now carrying this role with grace and strength". Stegall partly attributed the growth of the actor and character to her recovery early in the second season, the introduction of a sister and niece, the removal of John Scott from her storyline, and the [...] "delicate, reserved flirtation" [...] with Peter.|$|E
2500|$|Debney called Iron Man 2 [...] "odd in {{that there}} were {{not a lot of}} places where a true superhero theme could be played. Tony Stark is uber cool even as Iron Man, so, musically, we couldn’t state a {{full-blown}} superhero theme. The strains of Iron Man’s theme are heard only in a few spots by design. I’m hoping with future films, Iron Man might get his full-blown theme played aggressively." [...] For instance, Debney recorded several different versions of the score for scenes where Stark puts on the Iron Man suit, each with [...] "different portions of the theme fleshed out or left out". What was ultimately chosen [...] "was less thematic. It was sort of a groove {{with a little bit of}} French horn. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> was the right choice, but it was a difficult decision. It was difficult to find the areas in the movie where we could let Tony be a superhero." [...] He continued, [...] "There were moments where I wanted to play a scene broadly or make a love scene out of it but we were never able to go there", such as for the end of the film where [...] "Tony finally kisses Pepper ... there were a couple of versions I did that were really gorgeous and lush but it just didn't fit. It's a different kind of movie because they kiss and then all of a sudden the mood is broken. It's just the nature of this character." [...] Debney felt that this process led to the score being [...] "watered down and mashed up a little bit" [...] from what he originally intended. However, Debney did not feel the same about his music for the villain, Ivan Vanko, which he described as a personal [...] "joy". He said that Favreau [...] "gave me a great opportunity to get into [...] scene and learn 's circumstances and to play sincerely sad music for him and the relationship he had with his father. Jon gave me the opportunity to morph that and turn it into something really dark and twisted. For me that was the most satisfactory part of the score and the film". For Vanko's theme, the choir sang in Russian to [...] "capture the dark Russian soul" [...] of the character.|$|E
