5|$|The {{northern}} {{segment of}} CR101 heads northward along <b>Middle</b> <b>Neck</b> Road, passing local residences and local commercial buildings {{to the west}} and the Village Club of Sands Point to the east.

5|$|In Port Washington, NY101 passes Nassau Knolls Cemetery and narrows {{to become}} a four-lane {{undivided}} highway as it enters {{the center of the}} hamlet. It proceeds northâ€“south through downtown, passing several blocks of commercial buildings and Paul D. Schreiber Senior High School ahead of a junction with Main Street. North of this point, the surroundings of NY101 become more residential as the route narrows to two lanes and passes into the village of Sands Point. NY101 ends shortly afterward at an intersection with Astor Lane, at which point Port Washington Boulevard is continued by <b>Middle</b> <b>Neck</b> Road and designated as CR101.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} plan was shelved, {{the need for a}} highway in western Nassau County still existed. In 1963, the Department of Public Works revived the project; however, the routing was altered to extend from the Sunrise Highway (NY27) north to an intersection with CR101 (<b>Middle</b> <b>Neck</b> Road) in Sands Point. Part of the route would use modern NY101 and the right-of-way of an abandoned Long Island Rail Road line. In 1971, several proposed crossings of the Long Island Sound were studied. One crossing, a bridge connecting Sands Point to New Rochelle to Westchester County, may have become a northward extension of the highway if it was constructed. By 1971, though, hopes had begun to fade on the highway's prospects of becoming reality. Even if construction had begun in that year, the highway would not be open to traffic until 1975. The project was eventually shelved.|$|E
