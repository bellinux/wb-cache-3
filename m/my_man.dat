25|$|Shortly {{taking over}} control of the studio, Rogers {{announced}} that the unit system would remain in place, and {{that he was going to}} schedule 36 film for production for the 1936–37 production season; there would also be another eight western films starring Buck Jones, making a total of 44 films slated. The fourteen films still remaining on the Universal schedule for the 1935–36 season would also be completed as planned. This was almost a 33% increase over the prior year's production for the studio. In May Rogers was elected to Universal's Board of Directors. Roger's first production for Universal was 1936's <b>My</b> <b>Man</b> Godfrey, starring William Powell and Carole Lombard, which premiered on September 6, 1936, and was received quite favorably. The success of Godfrey, as well as several management decisions made by Rogers, led to Universal deciding to expand its 1937–38 production schedule to 52 features, including six westerns. Another accomplishment of Roger's during his tenure at Universal was the signing of teenage singer/actress Deanna Durbin. Her pictures, which usually did quite well at the box office, helped keep Universal profitable during the final years of 1930s.|$|E
500|$|.....while reading Fetter's oeuvre in {{the course}} of writing <b>my</b> <b>Man,</b> Economy, and State... I was struck by the {{brilliance}} and consistency of his integrated theory of distribution and by the neglect of Fetter in current histories of economic thought, even by those that are Austrian oriented. For Fetter's systematic theory, while challenging and original (particularly his theories of interest and rent), was emphatically in the Austrian school tradition.|$|E
500|$|Lombard's {{first film}} of 1936 was Love Before Breakfast, {{described}} by Gehring as [...] "The Taming of the Shrew, screwball style". In William K. Howard's The Princess Comes Across, her second comedy with MacMurray, {{she played a}} budding actress who wins a film contract by masquerading as a Swedish princess. The performance was considered a satire of Greta Garbo, and was widely praised by critics. Lombard's success continued as she was recruited by Universal Studios to star in the screwball comedy <b>My</b> <b>Man</b> Godfrey (1936). William Powell, who was playing the eponymous Godfrey, insisted on her being cast as the female lead; despite their divorce, the pair remained friendly and Powell felt she would be perfect {{in the role of}} Irene, a zany heiress who employs a [...] "forgotten man" [...] as the family butler. The film was directed by Gregory LaCava, who knew Lombard personally and advised that she draw on her [...] "eccentric nature" [...] for the role. She worked hard on the performance, particularly with finding the appropriate facial expressions for Irene. <b>My</b> <b>Man</b> Godfrey was released to great acclaim and was a box office hit. It received six nominations at the 9th Academy Awards, including Lombard for Best Actress. Biographers cite it as her finest performance, and Frederick Ott says it [...] "clearly established [...] as a comedienne of the first rank." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Lombard 23rd on {{its list}} of the 25 {{greatest}} American female screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema, {{and she has a}} star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6930 Hollywood Blvd. Lombard received one Academy Award for Best Actress nomination, for <b>My</b> <b>Man</b> Godfrey. Actresses who have portrayed her in films include Jill Clayburgh in Gable and Lombard (1976), Sharon Gless in [...] (1980), Denise Crosby in Malice in Wonderland (1985), Anastasia Hille in RKO 281 (1999) and Vanessa Gray in Lucy (2003).

500|$|On 9 October 1912, {{the driver}} of a horse-drawn {{carriage}} noticed a man crouching near {{the front door of}} the house of Countess Flora Sztaray, located on South Cliff Avenue in Eastbourne. Sztaray was known to possess large amounts of valuable jewellery and to be married to a rich Hungarian nobleman. The driver, who was Sztaray's coachman, informed Sztaray of the man's presence, whereupon Sztaray telephoned the police. Inspector Arthur Walls was sent to investigate. When Walls arrived on the scene, he observed a man lying on the portico above the front door. Walls called out, [...] "Now then, <b>my</b> <b>man,</b> you just come down." [...] The man fired two shots, the first of which struck and killed Walls.|$|E
500|$|Lombard was {{particularly}} noted for the zaniness of her performances, {{described as a}} [...] "natural prankster, a salty tongued straight-shooter, a feminist precursor {{and one of the}} few stars who was beloved by the technicians and studio functionaries who worked with her". [...] Life magazine noted that her film personality transcended to real life, [...] "her conversation, often brilliant, is punctuated by screeches, laughs, growls, gesticulations and the expletives of a sailor's parrot". Graham Greene praised the [...] "heartbreaking and nostalgic melodies" [...] of her faster-than-thought delivery. [...] "Platinum blonde, with a heart-shaped face, delicate, impish features and a figure made to be swathed in silver lamé, Lombard wriggled expressively through such classics of hysteria as Twentieth Century and <b>My</b> <b>Man</b> Godfrey." ...|$|E

500|$|Her first {{release of}} the year was Leisen's Swing High, Swing Low, a third pairing with MacMurray. The film focused on a romance between two cabaret performers, and was a {{critical}} and commercial success. It had been primarily a drama, with occasional moments of comedy, but for her next project, Lombard returned to the screwball genre. Producer David O. Selznick was eager to make a comedy with the actress, impressed by her work in <b>My</b> <b>Man</b> Godfrey, and hired Ben Hecht to write an original screenplay for her. Nothing Sacred, directed by William Wellman and co-starring Fredric March, satirized the journalism industry and [...] "the gullible urban masses", with Lombard playing a small-town girl who pretends to be dying and finds her story exploited by a New York reporter. Marking her only appearance in Technicolor, the film was highly praised and was one of Lombard's personal favorites.|$|E
500|$|Ziegfeld's widow, Billie Burke, was keen {{to pay off}} Ziegfeld's debts without {{filing for}} bankruptcy, and sold the rights to a biopic of him to Universal Pictures in late 1933. As a result, the film went into the {{pre-production}} phase in January 1934. Macguire had initially proposed the biographical film {{to them in the}} form of a [...] "filmusical entertainment" [...] set in a [...] "theatrical tradition" [...] and William Powell was cast as Ziegfeld. However, by February 1935, Macguire had fallen into disagreement with Universal over financial problems at the studio, and the entire production, including some already constructed sets and musical arrangements, were sold to MGM for US$300,000 (US$ in [...] dollars). As part of the deal however, Universal retained the services of Powell for the classic screwball comedy <b>My</b> <b>Man</b> Godfrey, which was released the same year as The Great Ziegfeld.|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Stop" [...] has a {{high pitched}} {{keyboard}} sound embedded in between {{the sound of a}} drum machine and clarinet. The lyrics essentially refer to the idea that [...] "I want <b>my</b> <b>man</b> and I am going to get him whatever". Rooksby noticed that the instrumental break in the song repeats the chorus, with a synth line added on the top. He felt that [...] "Can't Stop", at 4:45 length, was {{a good example of the}} division of Madonna's songs between dance music—where the length is important—and the requirement of classic pop songs, which can vary from two minutes to four minutes. J. Randy Taraborrelli, in his book , described Faure's song [...] "24 Hours" [...] as a slow track which fails to build up momentum. Joe Brown from The Washington Post described Davidson's [...] "Turn it Up" [...] as consisting of a slow background synth, that transforms into a rapidly progressing beat, with Davidson's singing reminiscent of the Beastie Boys.|$|E

500|$|Paramount quickly began casting Lombard as {{a leading}} lady, {{primarily}} in drama films. Her profile increased when she married William Powell in 1931, but the couple divorced after two years. A turning point in Lombard's career came when she starred in Howard Hawks' pioneering screwball comedy Twentieth Century (1934). The actress found her niche in this genre, and continued to appear in films such as Hands Across the Table (1935) (forming a popular partnership with Fred MacMurray), <b>My</b> <b>Man</b> Godfrey (1936), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and Nothing Sacred (1937). At this time, Lombard married [...] "the King of Hollywood", Clark Gable, and the supercouple gained much attention from the media. Keen to win an Oscar, {{at the end of}} the decade, Lombard began to move towards more serious roles. Unsuccessful in this aim, she returned to comedy in Alfred Hitchcock's Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941) and Ernst Lubitsch's To Be or Not to Be (1942)—her final film role.|$|E
500|$|Dan the Automator {{criticized the}} release, stating [...] "That wasn't a Dr. Octagon record. Dr. Octagon is me, Kool Keith, and Q-Bert. The label didn't have {{the legal right}} to use the name, but I didn't want to get {{involved}} in a legal battle...Keith's <b>my</b> <b>man,</b> just trying to make a little bit of money." [...] KutMasta Kurt stated that Thornton was reluctant to perform songs from the album, because the lyrics did not fit the music. John Lindland, who coproduced the final album under the name One-Watt Sun, stated in defense of the album, [...] "People say it's a fake. We don't have that feeling. We think that those are great tracks. It wasn't about remixing anything. They were our ideas, and Keith went on grooves that we sent to LA." [...] In response to Fanatik J's criticism of the album, One Watt Sun referred to him as being disgruntled {{as a result of the}} label discarding his music. According to Lindland, [...] "If we were him, we'd have [...] beef too".|$|E
500|$|Marge {{believes}} she has higher morals {{than most other}} characters, once leading a family values crusade against the violent The Itchy & Scratchy Show and being a prominent member of the [...] "Citizens' Committee on Moral Hygiene." [...] She often provides a voice of reason for the town itself, {{but many of the}} townspeople are frustrated or contemptuous of her frequent failure to recognize or react correctly to breaches of social norms. Marge is {{the only member of the}} family who encourages, and often forces, church attendance. In [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] (season four, 1992), Homer starts skipping church and Marge tells him [...] "don't make me choose between <b>my</b> <b>man</b> and my God, because you just can't win.". Yet, in some episodes, Marge's stereotypical attitude seems to affect her relationship with her daughter, Lisa, who is a feminist. For example, in [...] "Some Enchanted Evening" [...] (season one, 1990) When she was waiting for Ms. Botz, the babysitter, Bart, Lisa and Maggie asked Marge for some grub, but she quickly refused and they ran away.|$|E

I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what <b>my</b> <b>man</b> was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E
