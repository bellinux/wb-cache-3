5|$|Born a slave in Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman {{was beaten}} and whipped by her various masters as a child. Early in life, she {{suffered}} a traumatic head wound when an irate slave owner threw a heavy <b>metal</b> <b>weight</b> intending to hit another slave and hit her instead. The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of hypersomnia, which occurred throughout her life. She was a devout Christian and experienced strange visions and vivid dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God.|$|E
6000|$|... "A <b>metal</b> <b>weight</b> for {{attachment}} to {{the tail of a}} donkey to keep him from braying," [...] was the answer. [...] "It is known in this country that a donkey cannot utter a note unless he can lift his tail. Then, as now, gootles were made by a single concern having a great capital invested and an immense plant, and employing an army of workmen. It dealt, as it does to-day, directly with consumers. Afflicted with a sonant donkey a man would write to the trust and receive his gootle by return mail, or go personally to the factory and carry his purchase home on his shoulder--according to where he lived. The reformer said this was primitive, crude and injurious to the interests of the public and especially the poor. He proposed that the members of the gootle trust divide their capital and each member go into the business of making gootles for himself--I do not mean for his personal use--in different parts of the country. But none of them was to sell to consumers, but to other men, who would sell in quantity to still other men, who would sell single gootles for domestic use. Each manufacturer would of course require a full complement of officers, clerks and so forth, as would the other men--everybody but the consumer--and each would have to support them and make a profit himself. Competition would be so sharp that solicitors would have to be employed to make sales; and they too must have a living out of the business. Honored stranger, am I right in my inference that the proposed system has something in common with the one which obtains in your own happy, enlightened and prosperous country, and which you would approve?" ...|$|E

50|$|Astrojax is a toy {{consisting}} of three balls on a string. One ball is fixed {{at each end}} of the string, and the center ball is free to slide along the string between the two end balls. Inside each ball is a <b>metal</b> <b>weight.</b> The <b>metal</b> <b>weight</b> lowers the moment of inertia of the center ball so it can rotate rapidly in response to torques applied by the string. This prevents the string from snagging or tangling around the center ball.|$|E
50|$|Gusset {{plates are}} {{therefore}} used in most <b>metal</b> <b>weight</b> bearing structures, but {{the material and}} size of the gusset plate varies based on the structure. Bridges usually require thick sheets of steel for their gusset plates, but trusses sometimes only require small sheets of aluminium for their gusset plate.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} find the {{corrosion}} effects on materials in air pollution condition and to investigate the corrosion behavior of structural <b>metals,</b> <b>weight</b> change and mass loss were studied. The results obtained are discussed and their plausible interpretation is attempted. The results for the modern glass samples indicate that the increasing trend of the total deposited mass of particles per surface unit and haze, demonstrates a cumulative non-linear phenomenon with an asymptotic level of saturation...|$|R

50|$|The in-line spinner {{is named}} {{for the fact that}} a metal blade {{revolves}} around a central axis (a wire), which may be attached by a clevis (a c-shaped metal piece with holes that accommodates the wire) or by itself. Most in-line spinners have <b>metal</b> <b>weights</b> rigged behind the spinning blade and beads or brass hardware that separates the two for frictionless spinning. Due {{to the fact that the}} spinning blade cause the whole bait to rotate, line twist builds that creates line problems and tangles. Swivels are used to solve the problem of twist.|$|R

Keyboard is truly semi-weighted, with <b>metal</b> <b>weights</b> glued under the keys, feels identical to D-50 and {{considered one of}} the best synth-action keybeds ever made. It has a powerful arpeggiator with multiple patterns that can be timed by external MIDI clock (like sequencer or drum machine), nine built-in drum kits (you'll need an external drum machine to use these). The XP-30 is aimed at expansion by giving the user 2 slots for adding Roland's own SR-JV80 range of expansion cards.|$|R
50|$|Modern day sleighs combine light metals, steel runners, and an {{aerodynamic}} composite body. Competition sleighs must be {{a maximum}} of 3.80 m long (4-crew) or 2.70 m long (2-crew). The runners on both are set at 0.67 m gauge. Until the weight-limit rule was added in 1952, bobsleigh crews tended to be very heavy to ensure the greatest possible speed. Now, the maximum weight, including crew, is 630 kg (4-man), 390 kg (2-man), or 340 kg (2-woman), which {{can be reached via}} the addition of <b>metal</b> <b>weights.</b> The bobsleighs themselves are designed to be as light as possible to allow dynamic positioning of mass through the turns of the bobsleigh course.|$|R

The ducks for the races are {{specially}} made with a very flat base and a small <b>metal</b> <b>weight</b> for stabilisation purposes. Additionally, these ducks make no sound. The ducks are numbered now and you can rent as many as you want. Since 2008 the organisers of the Great British Duck Race have used blue ducks instead of the traditional yellow ones, because some people bring their own rubber ducks and set them in the water near the finish line.|$|E

The user must place his left hand on the device to use it, as it was designed for right-handed people, who usually use a mouse with their right hands. The n52 has a movable hand rest which can be set to 2 locations or removed to create 3 different hand positions to better suit various hand sizes by means of lifting the rest off the unit.|$|E
50|$|Since August 2004, {{an interim}} storage {{facility}} {{has been established}} {{on the grounds of}} the nuclear power plant for spent fuel elements with a heavy <b>metal</b> <b>weight</b> of 2,250 tonnes. It contains 192 storage spaces and was placed in operation in 2006. € 30 million have been budgeted for this. Construction of the building (104 m long, 38 m wide, and 18 m tall) was completed at the end of 2005. After interior fitting with electrical, heating, and ventilation equipment, installation of heavyweight hoists, and remaining exterior work, on August 25, 2006 the interim storage facility was opened and the first containers from the power plant moved in.|$|E
50|$|A {{specialized}} form of {{vaginal speculum}} is the weighted speculum, {{which consists of}} a broad half tube which is bent at about a 90 degree angle, with the channel of the tube on the exterior side of the angle. One end of the tube has a roughly spherical <b>metal</b> <b>weight</b> surrounding the channel of the speculum. A weighted speculum {{is placed in the}} vagina during vaginal surgery with the patient in the lithotomy position. The weight holds the speculum in place and frees the surgeon's hands for other tasks.A vaginal speculum is also used in fertility treatments, particularly artificial insemination, and allows the vaginal cavity to be opened and observed thereby facilitating the deposit of semen into the vagina.|$|E

5000|$|A {{well known}} and popular numismatic item is the 1944 nickel counterfeited by Francis LeRoy Henning. Unlike {{official}} specimens, this spurious item is missing a large mintmark for the Philadelphia Mint. Because of a different wartime composition, all nickels of this period had large mintmarks. Normally the Philadelphia mint would not have included one, but in 1944 all of its nickels had a [...] "P" [...] above the dome of Monticello. It is estimated that 100,000 of these coins were placed into circulation. [...] Today they remain readily available to collectors.Both scarce 1923-D and 1930-D dimes were found in circulation, and they are of interest to collectors since no such date-mint combinations were issued for this particular denomination. It {{has been suggested that}} they may have been part of an attempt by the Soviet Union to sell its silver on the world market by counterfeiting (with full precious <b>metal</b> <b>weight)</b> U.S. coins. If so, the engravers blundered by producing [...] "impossible" [...] coins.|$|E
50|$|The mani wheel, or hand prayer wheel, has a cylindrical, {{generally}} sheet-metal body (often beautifully embossed) {{mounted on}} a metal shaft or pin set into a wooden or metal handle that turns on a circular bearing commonly made of Turbinella (conch) shell. The cylinder itself is affixed with a cord or chain terminating in a <b>metal</b> <b>weight</b> allowing it to be spun by a slight rotation of the wrist. The weighted chain, known as a “governor” in Western technology, stabilizes the wheel and keeps it spinning with less input from the practitioner than would otherwise be the case. The common term, “prayer wheel” is a double misnomer. A long strip of rolled-up paper bearing printed or inscribed mantras (Tib. mani) rather than prayers, per se, is inside the cylinder. “Mill,” defined as “a spinning object that generates something,” is a better translation of the Tibetan ‘khor-lo than is “wheel” since {{it is thought that}} the spinning cylinder emanates positive energy, allowing the practitioner to accumulate wisdom and merit. The Tibetan name of this device is mani-chos-'khor (མ་ནི་ཆོས་འཁོར་).|$|E

5|$|For another episode for {{the series}} filmed in New York City he {{was asked by the}} NYPD not to pre-announce the performance, as crowd control for some Angel {{performances}} had become a concern for the police. This trick saw Angel hanging his feet, while bound with two straitjackets and a noose around his neck which were attached to <b>metal</b> <b>weights.</b> While he was successful in the trick, Angel tore his shoulder muscles and this required surgery in January 2014. This resulted in the temporary closing of the Believe stage show between January and April 2014, while he was recovering from the surgery and returning to performance shape. He did however host a new stage show featuring other magicians between February and March 2014 in lieu of performing in his own show.
