Navigation aids either measure position from a fixed point of reference (ex. landmark, north star, LORAN Beacon), relative position to a target (ex. radar, infra-red, ...) or track movement from a known position/starting point (e.g. IMU). Today's complex systems use multiple approaches to determine current position.

However, reconfigurable FPGAs are becoming increasingly common in flight systems, offering a potentially valuable possibility for improved levels of fault recovery – after a fault is detected and localised within an FPGA, it is feasible to reprogram the device, in flight, with an alternative, equivalent, circuit that does not depend upon the damaged portion of the chip. Designing such alternative chip layouts by hand is a valid option, though costly in terms of the man-hours of effort required; a fully automated alternative would be far preferable.

40|$|Abstract. In a {{distributed}} environment like Semantic Web, complex applications often need to handle multiple ontologies, where {{the heterogeneity of}} multiple ontologies arises. In order to reconcile these ontologies, ontology mappings are proposed to provide the interoperating rules between multiple ontologies. However, introducing mappings may cause inconsistencies and redundancies, which will break the soundness and balance of the original ontologies. This paper proposes an approach to eliminate inconsistencies and redundancies. First the mappings are classified into eleven kinds and multiple ontologies are modeled as a graph. Then the changes of the graph, when introducing different kinds of mappings orderly, are analyzed. Following refining steps include semantic checking to keep multiple ontologies sound, and semantic refinement to avoid <b>multiple</b> <b>redundancies.</b> All the steps in our approach can be performed in polynomial time. Our method has high efficiency and is feasible to applications about multiple ontologies in a {{distributed environment}}...|$|R

Over the past decade, the WSN community has significantly improved the success rate and the efficiency of WSN deployments through progress in networking primitives, operating systems, programming languages, and sensor mote hardware design. However, as WSN deployments grow in scale and are embedded in more places, their performance becomes increasingly susceptible to interference from external sources, as well as poor coordination in the radio transmissions of the network’s nodes. This thesis is a coordinated effort to study three types of radio interference {{in the context of}} large-scale WSNs: intra-network, external, and protocol interference.

The condenser cooling water used at OTB station is corrosive brackish water with exceedingly high sodium and chloride concentrations. Significant signs of corrosion inside the condenser {{have been found}} recently. In the event of condenser in-leakage, the salt contaminants in the cooling water will directly enter the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) {{with the potential for}} significant and costly damage resulting in a long plant outage. A dynamic mathematical model was developed in the thesis to analyse the consequences of condenser in-leakage at OTB station.

40|$|Wireless digital {{broadcasting}} {{applications such as}} digital audio broadcast (DAB) and digital video broadcast (DVB) are becoming increasingly popular since the digital format allows for quality improvements as compared to traditional analogue broadcast. The broadcasting is commonly based on packet transmission. In this thesis, we consider broadcasting over packet erasure channels. To achieve reliable transmission, error-control schemes are needed. By carefully designing the error-control schemes, transmission efficiency can be improved compared to traditiona lautomatic repeat-request (ARQ) schemes and rateless codes. Here, we first study {{the application of a}} novel binary deterministic rateless (BDR) code. Then, we focus on the design of network coding for the wireless broadcasting system, which can significantly improve the system performance compared to traditional ARQ. Both the one-hop broadcasting system and a relay-aided broadcasting system areconsidered. In the one-hop broadcasting system, we investigate the application of systematic BDR (SBDR) codes and instantaneously decodable network coding (IDNC). For the SBDR codes, we determine the number of encoded redundancy packets that guarantees high broadcast transmission efficiencies and simultaneous lowcomplexity. Moreover, with limited feedback the efficiency performance can be further improved. Then, we propose an improved network coding scheme that can asymptotically achieve the theoretical lower bound on transmission overhead for a sufficiently large number of information packets. In the relay-aided system, we consider a scenario where the relay node operates in half duplex mode, and transmissions from the BS and the relay, respectively, are over orthogonal channels. Based on random network coding, a scheduling problem for the transmissions of redundancy packets from the BS and the relay is formulated. Two scenarios; namely instantaneous feedback after each redundancy packet, and feedback after <b>multiple</b> <b>redundancy</b> packets are investigated. We further extend the algorithms to multi-cell networks. Besides random network coding, IDNC based schemes are proposed as well. We show that significant improvements in transmission efficiency are obtained as compared to previously proposed ARQ and network-coding-based schemes. QC 2011090...|$|E

Although much work has been performed in this area, the construction of fault trees is still generally done manually. In this paper, a new methodology of constructing fault trees from a system description is proposed. Multi-state input/output tables are introduced, which have the capability to capture output deviations during the normal operation of a component as well as under the influence of abnormality or failure. Two libraries, namely, a component library and a mark library, are introduced. The former stores component models and the latter stores a range of marks. The main purpose of a mark is to identify a certain feature of the system, such as a feedback loop or <b>multiple</b> <b>redundancies.</b> These two libraries are used to redraw the system in a graphical environment where the designer can witness the system come together and also input the necessary failure data for each component.

In contrast to the Israeli mission though the goal of El Dorado Canyon was not the destruction of Libya's IADS itself but to conduct a punitive strike against Muammar Gaddafi. Suppressing the IADS through non-lethal means would help accomplish this mission and, just as important after the Vietnam War, reduce casualties suffered by the strike group. For this reason, electronic jamming played a more prominent role in the operation than at Bekaa Valley and was carried out by both EF-111A Ravens and EA-6B Prowlers in the first ever joint US Air Force-Navy SEAD operation. For several reasons, F-4G Wild Weasels could not take part in El Dorado Canyon, requiring the use of the Navy's carrier-borne A-7E Corsair IIs and F/A-18 Hornets to attack Libyan SAM sites. Their lack of the Wild Weasel's specialized equipment required these fighters to fire their HARMs preemptively at Libyan SAM sites, a costly and wasteful method which nevertheless was effective due to the limited nature of the raid. For their part, the Libyans and their Soviet advisers had also learned lessons from the Bekaa Valley campaign: their IADS was constructed with <b>multiple</b> <b>redundancies</b> (including overlapping radar coverage and hardened landlines between defense sites) and a wider array of both Soviet and Western radar systems able to operate on multiple frequencies to avoid jamming.
