5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that barotrauma is causing bat fatalities around wind turbines. Bats have typical mammalian lungs, which {{are thought to}} be more sensitive to sudden air pressure changes than the lungs of birds, making them more liable to fatal rupture. In addition, {{it has been suggested that}} bats are attracted to these structures, perhaps seeking roosts, and thereby increasing the death rate. Acoustic deterrents <b>may</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> reduce bat mortality at wind farms.|$|E

5|$|Many {{tropical}} butterflies have seasonal {{forms for}} dry and wet seasons. These are switched by the hormone ecdysone.

Then, we outline the didactical value of examples generations tasks: they <b>may</b> <b>help</b> teachers <b>to</b> test their students’ level of conceptualization, and <b>may</b> <b>help</b> students <b>to</b> give meaning to mathematical definitions...|$|R

5|$|When prey is swallowed, it is {{liquefied}} in the pharynx by enzymes and by muscular contractions of the pharynx. The resulting slurry is wafted {{through the}} canal system by {{the beating of}} the cilia, and digested by the nutritive cells. The ciliary rosettes in the canals <b>may</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> transport nutrients to muscles in the mesoglea. The anal pores may eject unwanted small particles, but most unwanted matter is regurgitated via the mouth.|$|E
5|$|A small, unisex monastic {{community}} in Bithynia, near Constantinople, may {{have developed the}} cross-in-square plan church during the Iconoclastic period, which would explain the plan's small scale and unified naos. The ruined church of St. John at Pelekete monastery is an early example. Monks had supported the use of icons, unlike the government-appointed secular clergy, and monasticism would become increasingly popular. A new type of privately funded urban monastery developed from the 9th century on, which <b>may</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> explain {{the small size of}} subsequent building.|$|E

5|$|European nightjars hunt by sight, silhouetting {{their prey}} against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly {{continuously}} on darker nights when prey {{is harder to}} see. Hunting frequency reduces {{in the middle of}} the night. Although they have very small bills, the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth, which <b>may</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> locate or funnel prey into the mouth. Indigestible parts of insects, such as the chitin exoskeleton, are regurgitated as pellets.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s saw a {{resurgence}} {{in the use}} of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal. Donkeys and guard llamas have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs. Interspecific pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or horses, <b>may</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep. In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Tourette's and no {{medication}} that works universally for all individuals without significant adverse effects. Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders. The management of the symptoms of Tourette's may include pharmacological, behavioral and psychological therapies. While pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, other treatments (such as supportive psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy) <b>may</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> avoid or ameliorate depression and social isolation, and to improve family support. Educating a patient, family, and surrounding community (such as friends, school, and church) is a key treatment strategy, and may be all that is required in mild cases.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the goldcrest's range, {{the main}} {{predator}} of small woodland birds is the Eurasian sparrowhawk, {{which has a}} diet consisting of up to 98% of birds. Merlins, tawny and long-eared owls also hunt goldcrests. The erratic movements and flights of small woodland birds, which are vulnerable to attack while away from cover, <b>may</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> confuse their predators. The goldcrest has only very rarely been recorded as a host of the common cuckoo, a widespread European brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying (ovipositing) {{involves}} {{not only}} the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem. The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up {{much of the time}} that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. Flying in tandem has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male <b>may</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> pull her out of the water.|$|E
5|$|It {{contains}} more than 151 different polypeptides, and has a very high protein-to-phospholipid ratio (more than 3:1 by weight, which is about 1protein for 15phospholipids). The inner membrane is home to around 1/5 of the total protein in a mitochondrion. In addition, the inner membrane is rich in an unusual phospholipid, cardiolipin. This phospholipid was originally discovered in cow hearts in 1942, and is usually characteristic of mitochondrial and bacterial plasma membranes. Cardiolipin contains four fatty acids rather than two, and <b>may</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> make the inner membrane impermeable. Unlike the outer membrane, the inner membrane doesn't contain porins, and is highly impermeable to all molecules. Almost all ions and molecules require special membrane transporters to enter or exit the matrix. Proteins are ferried into the matrix via the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) complex or via Oxa1. In addition, there is a membrane potential across the inner membrane, formed {{by the action of}} the enzymes of the electron transport chain.|$|E
