5|$|After Indian Independence, <b>Mysore</b> city {{remained}} {{as part of}} the <b>Mysore</b> State, now known as Karnataka. Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, then king of <b>Mysore,</b> was allowed to retain his titles and was nominated as the Rajapramukh (appointed governor) of the state. He died in September 1974 and was cremated in <b>Mysore</b> city. Over the years, <b>Mysore</b> became well known as a centre for tourism; the city remained largely peaceful, except for occasional riots related to the Kaveri river water dispute. Among the events that took place in <b>Mysore</b> and made national headlines were a fire at a television studio that claimed 62 lives in 1989, and the sudden deaths of many animals at the <b>Mysore</b> Zoo.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} that followed, parts of {{northern}} Karnataka were ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maratha Empire, the British, and other powers. In the south, the <b>Mysore</b> Kingdom, a former vassal of the Vijayanagara Empire, was briefly independent. With the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, Haidar Ali, the commander-in-chief of the <b>Mysore</b> army, gained control of the region. After his death, the kingdom was inherited by his son Tipu Sultan. To contain European expansion in South India, Haidar Ali and later Tipu Sultan fought four significant Anglo-Mysore Wars, the last of which resulted in Tippu Sultan's death and the incorporation of <b>Mysore</b> into the British Raj in 1799. The Kingdom of <b>Mysore</b> was restored to the Wodeyars and <b>Mysore</b> remained a princely state under the British Raj.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of <b>Mysore</b> {{reached a}} peak in {{economic}} power under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, in the post-Mughal {{era of the}} mid-late 18th century. They embarked on an ambitious program of economic development, aiming to increase the wealth and revenue of <b>Mysore.</b> Under their reign, <b>Mysore</b> overtook the Bengal Subah as India's dominant economic power, with productive agriculture and textile manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Mysore</b> {{painting}} {{style is}} {{an offshoot of}} the Vijayanagar school of painting, and King Raja Wodeyar (1578–1617 CE) is credited with having been its patron. The distinctive feature of these paintings is the gesso work, to which gold foil is applied. <b>Mysore</b> is known for rosewood inlay work; around 4,000 craftsmen were estimated to be involved in this art in 2002. The city lends its name to the <b>Mysore</b> silk saree, a women's garment made with pure silk and gold zari (thread). <b>Mysore</b> Peta, the traditional indigenous turban worn by the erstwhile rulers of <b>Mysore,</b> is worn by men in some traditional ceremonies. A notable local dessert that traces its history to the kitchen in the <b>Mysore</b> palace is <b>Mysore</b> pak.|$|E
5|$|Tourism is {{the major}} {{industry}} in <b>Mysore.</b> The city attracted about 3.15million tourists in 2010. <b>Mysore</b> has traditionally been home to industries such as weaving, sandalwood carving, bronze work {{and the production of}} lime and salt. The planned industrial growth {{of the city and the}} state was first envisaged at the <b>Mysore</b> economic conference in 1911. This led to the establishment of industries such as the <b>Mysore</b> Sandalwood Oil Factory in 1917 and the Sri Krishnarajendra Mills in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Another temple is Chamundeshwari Temple on Chamundi Hill, <b>Mysore.</b> Here, {{the goddess}} is {{identified}} with Durga, who killed the buffalo demon. Chamundeshwari or Durga, the fierce form of Shakti, a tutelary deity held in reverence for centuries by the Maharaja of <b>Mysore.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even as a princely state, <b>Mysore</b> came to {{be counted}} among the more {{developed}} and urbanized regions of India. This period (1799–1947) also saw <b>Mysore</b> emerge {{as one of the}} important centres of art and culture in India. The <b>Mysore</b> kings were not only accomplished exponents of the fine arts and men of letters, they were enthusiastic patrons as well, and their legacies continue to influence music and art even today.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{the next}} two decades, the western reaches of <b>Mysore</b> {{remained}} vulnerable to attacks by the Coorg army. In the border district of Yelusavira, the Coorg and <b>Mysore</b> forces fought to a stalemate and, in the end, had to work out a tax sharing arrangement.|$|E
5|$|In 1876–77, however, {{towards the}} end of the period of direct British rule, <b>Mysore</b> was struck by a devastating famine with {{estimated}} mortality figures ranging between 700,000 and 1,100,000, or nearly a fifth of the population. Shortly thereafter, Maharaja Chamaraja X, educated in the British system, took over the rule of <b>Mysore</b> in 1881, following the success of a lobby set up by the Wodeyar dynasty that was in favour of rendition. Accordingly, a resident British officer was appointed at the <b>Mysore</b> court and a Diwan to handle the Maharaja's administration. From then onwards, until Indian independence in 1947, <b>Mysore</b> remained a Princely State within the British Indian Empire, with the Wodeyars continuing their rule.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 <b>Mysore</b> and Bangalore co-hosted the city's biggest sports event ever, the National Games of India. <b>Mysore</b> was {{the venue}} for six sports: archery, gymnastics, equestrianism, handball, table tennis and wrestling. Cricket {{is by far}} the most popular sport in <b>Mysore.</b> The city has five {{established}} cricket grounds. Javagal Srinath, who represented India for several years as its frontline fast bowler, comes from <b>Mysore.</b> Other prominent sportsmen from the city are Prahlad Srinath, who has represented India in Davis Cup tennis tournaments; Reeth Abraham, a national champion in the heptathlon and a long jump record holder; Sagar Kashyap, the youngest Indian to officiate at the Wimbledon Championships; and Rahul Ganapathy, a national amateur golf champion. The <b>Mysore</b> race course hosts a racing season each year from August through October. India's first youth hostel was formed in the Maharaja's College Hostel in 1949.|$|E
5|$|In December 1789, {{after five}} years of {{diplomatic}} wrangling about the terms of the Treaty of Mangalore that had ended the Second Anglo-Mysore War, the ruler of <b>Mysore</b> Tipu Sultan again declared war on the British East India Company and their allies in Southern India. For the next two years the war continued as British forces and their allies drove the <b>Mysore</b> armies back towards the capital of Seringapatam. Both sides were reliant on supply by sea to maintain their campaigns inland: the British forces were supported from their major ports at Bombay and Madras, later stationing additional forces at the small port of Tellicherry inside <b>Mysore</b> territory. The Mysorean forces were supplied through Mangalore by French ships. France had been an ally of the Tipu Sultan's father Hyder Ali during the Second Anglo-Mysore War and although the political instability caused by the French Revolution in Europe prevented active involvement, they ensured that their ships kept up a supply of equipment to <b>Mysore</b> throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mysore</b> Dasara {{is celebrated}} as the Nada habba (state festival) {{and this is}} marked by major festivities at <b>Mysore.</b> Ugadi (Kannada New Year), Makara Sankranti (the harvest festival), Ganesh Chaturthi, Nagapanchami, Basava Jayanthi, Deepavali, and Ramzan are the other major festivals of Karnataka.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mysore</b> {{is a major}} tourist {{destination}} {{in its own right}} and serves as a base for other tourist attractions in the vicinity. The city receives large number of tourists during the 10-day Dasara festival. One of the most visited monuments in India, the Amba Vilas Palace, or <b>Mysore</b> Palace, is the centre of the Dasara festivities. The Jaganmohana Palace, The Sand Sculpture Museum the Jayalakshmi Vilas and the Lalitha Mahal are other palaces in the city. Chamundeshwari Temple, atop the Chamundi Hills, and St. Philomena's Church, Wesley's Cathedral are notable religious places in <b>Mysore.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Mysore</b> {{is called}} the City of Palaces because of several ornate {{examples}} in the city. Among the most notable are Amba Vilas, popularly known as <b>Mysore</b> Palace; Jaganmohana Palace, which also serves as an art gallery; Rajendra Vilas, {{also known as the}} summer palace; Lalitha Mahal, which has been converted into a hotel; and Jayalakshmi Vilas. The main palace of <b>Mysore</b> was burned down in 1897, and the present-day structure was built on the same site. Amba Vilas palace exhibits an Indo-Saracenic style of architecture on the outside, but a distinctly Hoysala style in the interior. Even though the Government of Karnataka maintains the <b>Mysore</b> palace, a small portion has been allocated for the erstwhile Royal family to live in. The Jayalakshmi Vilas Mansion was constructed by Sri Chamaraja Wodeyar for his daughter Jayalakshammanni. It is now a museum dedicated to folk culture and artifacts of the royal family.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mysore</b> started {{receiving}} television broadcasts in {{the early}} 1980s, when Doordarshan (public service broadcaster of the Indian government) started broadcasting its national channel all over India. This was the only channel available to Mysoreans until Star TV started satellite channels in 1991. Direct-to-home channels are now available in <b>Mysore.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Mysore</b> was the {{location}} of the first private radio broadcasting station in India when Akashavani (voice from the sky) was established in the city on 10 September 1935 by M.V. Gopalaswamy, a professor of psychology, at his house in the Vontikoppal area of <b>Mysore,</b> using a 50-watt transmitter. The station was taken over by the princely state of <b>Mysore</b> in 1941 and was moved to Bangalore in 1955. In 1957, Akashvani was chosen as the official name of All India Radio (AIR), the radio broadcaster of the Government of India. The AIR station at <b>Mysore</b> broadcasts an FM radio channel at 100.6MHz, and Gyan Vani broadcasts on 105.2. BIG FM and Red FM are the two private FM channels operating in the city.|$|E
5|$|Newspaper {{publishing}} in <b>Mysore</b> {{started in}} 1859 when Bhashyam Bhashyacharya began publishing a weekly newspaper in Kannada called the Mysooru Vrittanta Bodhini, {{the first of}} a number of weekly newspapers published in the following three decades. A well-known <b>Mysore</b> publisher during Wodeyar rule was M. Venkatakrishnaiah, known as the father of Kannada journalism, who started several news magazines. Many local newspapers are published in <b>Mysore</b> and carry news mostly related to the city and its surroundings, and national and regional dailies in English and Kannada are available, as in the other parts of the state. Sudharma, the only Indian daily newspaper in Sanskrit, is published in <b>Mysore.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>Mysore</b> silk {{industry}} was first initiated during {{the rule of}} Tipu Sultan. Later the industry {{was hit by a}} global depression and competition from imported silk and rayon. In {{the second half of the}} 20th century, it however revived and the <b>Mysore</b> State became the top multivoltine silk producer in India.|$|E
5|$|The {{citizens}} of <b>Mysore</b> elect four representatives to the Legislative assembly of Karnataka through the constituencies of Chamaraja, Krishnaraja, Narasimharaja and Chamundeshwari. <b>Mysore</b> city, {{being part of}} the larger <b>Mysore</b> Lok Sabha constituency, also elects one member to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament. The politics in the city is dominated by three political parties: the Indian National Congress (INC), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the Janata Dal (Secular) (JDS).|$|E
5|$|The {{city had}} the first private radio station in India. <b>Mysore</b> University is {{headquartered}} in <b>Mysore,</b> which has produced several notable scientists, authors, politicians, actors, singers, and sportsmen. Cricket and lawn tennis {{are the most popular}} sports in the city.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom {{reached the}} height of its {{military}} power and dominion {{in the latter half}} of the 18th century under the de facto rulers Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan. The latter demolished parts of <b>Mysore</b> to remove legacies of the Wodeyar dynasty. During this time, <b>Mysore</b> kingdom came into conflict with the Marathas, the British and the Nizam of Golconda, leading to the four Anglo-Mysore wars, success in the first two of which was followed by defeat in the third and fourth. After Tipu Sultan's death in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799, the capital of the kingdom was moved back to <b>Mysore</b> from Seringapatam, and the kingdom was distributed by the British to their allies of the Fourth <b>Mysore</b> war. The landlocked interior of the previous <b>Mysore</b> Kingdom was turned into a princely state under the suzerainty of the British Crown. The former Wodeyar rulers were reinstated as puppet monarchs, now styled Maharajas. The British administration was assisted locally by Diwan (chief minister) Purnaiah. Purnaiah is credited with improving Mysore's public works. <b>Mysore</b> lost its status as the administrative centre of the kingdom in 1831, when the British commissioner moved the capital to Bangalore. It regained that status in 1881 and remained the capital of the Princely State of <b>Mysore</b> within the British Indian Empire until India became independent in 1947.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{education}} system was {{enhanced by the}} establishment of the University of <b>Mysore</b> in 1916 by Maharaja Krishnarajendra Wadiyar IV. Until reorganisation and renaming of <b>Mysore</b> State, <b>Mysore</b> University was the supreme university and prescribed education in and around the Kingdom of <b>Mysore.</b> Various disciplines were, later, delegated to subsidiary institutions, which later grew up to universities. Owing to rapid increase in the student population, department of medicine was transferred to Rajiv Gandhi University in 1984. Later, in 1998, a surge in engineering disciplines and students forced the spawning of Visvesvaraya Technological University. Old institutes that were affiliated of the University in these disciplines now continue to operate in affiliation to the new ones or in autonomy: <b>Mysore</b> Medical College & Research Institute is affiliated to Rajiv Gandhi University, while engineering and technical institutions like the National Institute of Engineering and SJCE function autonomously.|$|E
5|$|The {{years that}} {{followed}} witnessed cordial relations between <b>Mysore</b> and the British until things began to sour in the 1820s. Even though the Governor of Madras, Thomas Munro, determined after a personal investigation in 1825 {{that there was no}} substance to the allegations of financial impropriety made by A. H. Cole, the incumbent Resident of <b>Mysore,</b> the Nagar rebellion (a civil insurrection) which broke out {{towards the end of the}} decade changed things considerably. In 1831, close on the heels of the insurrection and citing mal-administration, the British took direct control of the princely state. For the next fifty years, <b>Mysore</b> passed under the rule of successive British Commissioners; Sir Mark Cubbon, renowned for his statesmanship, served from 1834 until 1861 and put into place an efficient and successful administrative system which left <b>Mysore</b> a well-developed state.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of British power, English {{education}} gained prominence in addition to traditional education in local languages. These changes were orchestrated by Lord Elphinstone, {{the governor of the}} Madras Presidency. His plan became the constitution of the central collegiate institution or University Board in 1841. Accordingly, a high school department of the university was established. For imparting education in the interior regions, schools were raised in principal towns which eventually were elevated to college level, with each college becoming central to many local schools (zilla schools). The earliest English-medium schools appeared in 1833 in <b>Mysore</b> and spread across the region. In 1858, the department of education was founded in <b>Mysore</b> and by 1881, there were an estimated 2,087 English-medium schools in the state of <b>Mysore.</b> Higher education became available with the formation of Bangalore Central College in Bangalore (1870), Maharaja's College (1879), Maharani's College (1901) and the <b>Mysore</b> University (1916) in <b>Mysore</b> and the St. Agnes College in Mangalore (1921).|$|E
5|$|Before {{the advent}} of the European system of {{education}} in <b>Mysore,</b> agraharas (Brahmin quarters) provided Vedic education to Hindus, and madrassas provided schooling for Muslims. Modern education began in <b>Mysore</b> when a free English school was established in 1833. Maharaja's College was founded in 1864. A high school exclusively for girls was established in 1881 and was later renamed Maharani's Women's College. The Industrial School, the first institute for technical education in the city, was established in 1892; this was followed by the Chamarajendra Technical Institute in 1913. While the modern system of education have makde inroads, colleges such as the <b>Mysore</b> Sanskrit Pāthaśhāla, established in 1876, still continue to provide Vedic education.|$|E
5|$|British colonial {{administration}} was dominated in the 1760s and 1770s by Warren Hastings, {{the first man}} to hold the title of Governor-General. The military arm of the East India Company was directed during the Seven Years' War and the Second Anglo-Mysore War by General Eyre Coote, who died in 1783 during the later stages of the war with <b>Mysore.</b> Company policy, as implemented by Hastings, had involved the company in intrigues and shifting alliances involving France, <b>Mysore,</b> the Marathas, and factions within those and other local territories.|$|E
5|$|By 1761, the Maratha menace had diminished and by 1763, Haider Ali had {{captured}} the Keladi kingdom, defeated {{the rulers of}} Bilgi, Bednur and Gutti, invaded the Malabar {{in the south and}} conquered the Zamorin's capital Calicut with ease in 1766 and extended the <b>Mysore</b> kingdom up to Dharwad and Bellary in the north. <b>Mysore</b> was now a major political power in the subcontinent and Haider's meteoric rise from relative obscurity and his defiance formed one of the last remaining challenges to complete British hegemony over the Indian subcontinent – a challenge which would take them more than three decades to overcome.|$|E

5|$|From 1761 onwards, Hyder Ali, a {{distinguished}} {{soldier in the}} <b>Mysore</b> army, took de facto control of the throne of the Kingdom of <b>Mysore</b> through the Wodeyar dynasty. Hyder occupied Mangalore in 1763. The Mangalorean Catholics numbered 80,000 in 1767. In February 1768 the British captured Mangalore from Hyder. Toward the end of 1768, Hyder and his son Tipu Sultan defeated the British and recaptured Mangalore fort. After the conquest, Hyder was informed that the Mangalorean Catholics had helped the British in their conquest of Mangalore. Hyder believed that this behaviour of the Christians amounted to treachery against the sovereign.|$|E
