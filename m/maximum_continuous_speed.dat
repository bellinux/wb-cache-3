The turbomachinery string consists of a multistage centrifugal compressor driven by a single valve multistage steam turbine. The steam turbine is rated at 1837 kW (2463 hp) with a <b>maximum</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>speed</b> of 9734 rpm. The string is currently operating in propane refrigeration service at a petrochemical complex in Saudi Arabia. Both the steam turbine and the compressor have magnetic journal and thrust bearings, dry gas face seals to contain the process gas in the compressor, and pneumatic/electronic actuators control the steam flow through the steam turbine while providing trip protection. The design of the compressor, steam turbine, associated components, and the control theory required by the magnetic bearings are reviewed and discussed in detail. The development of the theoretical rotordynarnic simulation for magnetic bearings is presented and the results are compared with actual operating conditions. Special consideration is given to the coastdown case where the rotors are delevitated onto the auxiliary bearings. Shop testing and control system tuning of the assembled turbomachinery string along with field operating experience are reviewed. ? Finally, the trouble spots encountered during the design, manufacture, testing, installation, and field operation of this oilfree string are discussed and suggestions are made in order to avoid these problems in the future...|$|E

40|$|LectureA new {{technology}} challenge in centrifugal compressor design and operation is the condensate phase management. End users (especially in offshore and subsea operations) {{are more and}} more interested to have a Wet Gas Compression system which is able to tolerate liquid in the process gas. Authors? Company has initiated for several years a research program aiming to investigate the impact of the liquid phase on centrifugal compressor operability (mainly thermodynamics, rotordynamics, erosion, axial thrust). As an introduction, the Authors? Company past experiences and more recent experimental tests [Ransom D. et al. 2011], [Bertoneri M. et al. 2012], are reviewed in order to show how the rotordynamic behaviour of a centrifugal compressor may be affected by the wet gas. However in the core, this paper is focused on the novel rotordynamic experimental outcomes of a wet gas single stage compressor test campaign. The machine was equipped with the following special instrumentation: Pressure and temperature probes along the flow path and internal seals; Magnetic lamination installed on the shaft end to allow for stability test through a magnetic exciter; Load cells installed in the thrust bearing; Torquemeter installed at the compressor coupling. The explored test conditions were: Wet gas = Air and Water mixture up to 3 % of Liquid Volume Fraction (LVF); Suction pressure levels = 10, 15, 20 bar-a; <b>Maximum</b> <b>Continuous</b> <b>Speed</b> = 13500 rpm. The compressor went through an extensive test campaign where the following aspects were thoroughly investigated: Rotordynamic behaviour during steady state wet operation; Rotordynamic stability (through magnetic exciter); Transient phenomena: response to liquid load variations (LVF up to 8 %), start-up/shutdown from wet conditions, start-up with stratified flow into suction pipe. The compressor dynamic behaviour was monitored both from lateral viewpoint (using no contact probes located close to bearing locations) and axial/torsional viewpoint (through the special instrumentation described above). Overall the compressor was able to withstand a huge amount of liquid phase, with an increased vibration level with respect to dry conditions but still in the safe area, both in steady and transient tests. Finally, major differences were found only at high flow ? high liquid/gas density ratio conditions where an unexpected subsynchronous vibration (SSV) was showing up. The nature of this SSV was deeply investigated and finally it was fixed through a balance piston seal geometry change...|$|E
40|$|LectureStandard {{centrifugal}} compressors {{are designed to}} process gas with limited liquid content: significant presence of liquid {{may be responsible for}} the rapid erosion and corrosion of both static and rotating components that yield to higher failure risk and shorter maintenance periods. Moreover the presence of liquid is associated to significant modifications of machine performance and machine operability. However, the possibility of compressing gas containing non negligible amounts of liquid allows to reduce size, dimensions and costs of the liquid removal stations with a consequent positive impact on the layout of subsea compression stations. With this aim, the OEM has developed a family of centrifugal impellers, the Wet Tolerant Impellers (WTI), specifically designed to process gas containing non negligible amounts of liquid, increasing the erosion resistance and promoting the liquid droplets breakup for subsequent stages. ?The validation of WTI has been carried out at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim; the test rig is a single stage air-water multiphase open-loop facility driven by a 450 kW motor capable of a <b>maximum</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>speed</b> equal to 11000 rpm. ?In the test campaign, first a standard impeller has been tested {{to assess the impact of}} liquid phase on performance and operating range (results have been summarized in Ferrara et al. [14]), then the specific WTI design has been tested and directly compared with the standard impeller results. The comparative test campaign has been focused on three different aspects: Performance evaluation in dry and wet conditions; Operating range evaluation in dry and wet conditions; Comparative erosion test. ?WTI test results have been compared with the performance curves obtained through the OEM internal tool specifically developed for the prediction of {{centrifugal compressors}} performance in wet conditions. Performance has been assessed varying the amount of liquid carried by the gas at two different rotating speeds: five Liquid Mass Fractions (LMF) have been considered for each speedline and a minimum of six test points have been recorded from partflow to overflow. The effect of liquid on machine operability has been assessed through a left-limit investigation by means of dynamic pressure probes readings in order to evaluate the stall/surge behavior for different values of LMF. In addition, the function between head rise to surge and LMF has been reconstructed. ?Tests results have shown the effectiveness of liquid tolerant design: erosion effects are weaker on WTI while performance levels and operating range are comparable to those of standard impellers...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 46 - 59 The current {{centrifugal}} compressor {{design for the}} Oil & Gas market {{is more and more}} challenging since the cost requirements and the presence of many competitors is pushing towards casing size reduction and rotational speed increase. The first requirement basically leads {{to increase the number of}} wheels per rotor and the second to cross more critical speeds requiring the proper degree of damping. The two consequences together lead also to increase the rotor flexibility ratio (defined as the ratio between the <b>Maximum</b> <b>Continuous</b> <b>Speed</b> and the first critical speed as per the Fulton diagram and API 617 7 th ed. [1 - 2]) and finally the rotordynamic stability is very much challenged. The {{centrifugal compressor}}s rotordynamic stability is then strictly related to the internal seals? dynamic behaviour and for this reason the authors? Company decided several years ago to develop internally a High Pressure Seal Test Rig to measure seals? stiffness and damping. The rig is now in operation. This paper aims to describe the main test rig capabilities, the applied identification procedures and the preliminary test results on a long labyrinth seal (smooth rotor - straight toothed stator). Due to the pressure level (500 bar design pressure), the test rig plant appears like a high-pressure industrial plant equipped with the testing cell (a 1 : 1 scale high pressure compressor) and all the relevant auxiliaries: a 400 kW electric motor (driven by a VFD), a speed increaser gear box, a high pressure reservoir (6 m 3) with a volumetric compressor to fill it, high pressure pipes and valves. The testing cell is composed of a high-pressure compressor casing with stator parts capable to regulate the seal inlet swirl and a rotor running on Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs), which serve as exciters (5 kN MAX Force over a 0 - 330 Hz frequency range per axis) and displacement transducers. Special instrumentation is installed into the testing cell in order to measure the main test parameters: seal upstream/downstream gas pressure, upstream temperature and swirl and mass flow. Industrial high-pressure instrumentation is installed on the plant for regulation and monitoring purpose. Maximum test pressure is 350 bar and maximum rotational speed is 15000 rpm. Test gas is nitrogen. The AMBs control-system capabilities have been tuned to define several alternative excitation patterns and the relevant state of the art identification techniques have been applied. The first seal tested is a long labyrinth seal to simulate a centrifugal compressor balance piston seal. Test results and comparison with a commercial bulk flow code predictions will be fully described. Finally, the future test program will be showed...|$|E
