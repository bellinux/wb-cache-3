40|$|Broad-band {{microwave}} {{integrated circuit}} (<b>MIC)</b> <b>amplifier</b> design is a complex, multi-disciplinary process. This work focuses on three important aspects: the behaviour of microstrip transmission lines, discontinuities, and related structures; the accurate measurement of components and devices mounted in microstrip circuits; and the circuit design methodology. Techniques for microstrip quasi-static analysis are reviewed {{in order to}} identify methods suitable for extension to deal with the effects of substrate anisotropy. An integral equation method is described and the anisotropic Green's function derived using an extension to the method of partial images. Proposed transform methods are assessed and the preferred option implemented by adaption of a microstrip analysis computer program. A method, by which accurate measurements of microstrip properties may be made, is developed. Involving measurements of the resonant behaviour of half-wavelength short circuit resonators with two arbitrary coupling conditions, this technique allows the unloaded properties to be deduced. Results for microstrip on a sapphire substrate concur with the analysis. A pragmatic but effective approach to the calculation of the capacity component of microstrip discontinuities, and some other three dimensional MIC structures, is described and developed to allow existing data for isotropic substrates to be applied to the anisotropic situation. The computer corrected network analyser (CCNA) is a widely used microwave measurement tool. Weaknesses in popular correction strategies are identified and remedies developed. In particular, revised calibration equations that better accommodate test port mismatch variation with s-parameter selection, and a model for quadrature error are presented. A 2 -port calibration scheme suitable for use with MIC transmission lines, using only simple standards, is described. The standards are partially self-calibrating;the values of propagation constant, loss, and end effect are deduced in the calibration process. An effective jig for use with microstrip is described and the results of measurements on microwave transistors presented. Conventionally microwave amplifiers are designed using reactive components both to achieve good port matches and compensate the frequency dependent gain of the active devices. The problems associated with this approach are enumerated and the alternatives reviewed. A methodology which combines the benefits of frequency dependant dissipative networks with the elegance of reactive network synthesis is described. The device gain slope is compensated by simple lumped or distributed circuits incorporating a resistive element to produce a composite `device' with a specififed (flat) maximum available gain frequency response. Reactive matching networks are then used to interface these gain blocks. By this structured approach the amplifier gain breakdown can be defined at the outset and preserved through the design process. Other advantages stemming from the use of dissipative compensation include improved tolerance to device parameter and component value scatter, reduced group delay variations and enhanced reverse isolation. The method is demonstrated by the design and characterisation of 4 to 9 GHz amplifier having a representative specification. The close conformance of the performance of the untrimmed amplifier to that predicted by computer simulation testifies to the inherent accuracy of the design method, the microstrip (and related structures) analysis techniques and the CCNA MIC calibration scheme...|$|E

A metamorphic technology process (mHEMT) of 50 nm gate length is used to manufacture the transistor. Design {{is based on a}} three stage common source transistor configuration and surface mounted devices (SMD) with high quality factors. Therefore, gain and noise performance are improved compared with monolithic technology (MMIC). At room temperature the mean measured gain is G = 22. 4 dB and the noise temperature is Tn = 175 K. When cooled to Tp = 13 K, insertion gain is Gi = 23. 8 dB and the noise temperature is Tn = 26 K. The DC power consumption is extremely low, PDC = 5. 7 mW at cryogenic temperatures.

40|$|Terahertz is {{the portion}} of the {{spectrum}} that covers a frequency range between 300 GHz - 3 THz. This frequency band has proven its potential for imaging applications thanks to the good compromise between spatial resolution and penetration; however, this push towards high frequencies contains many technological difficulties in all the subsystems involved in the signal generation, transmission and detection. The power budget restrictions and high losses that sources and receivers currently suffer at these frequencies require systems {{with a high level of}} integration among all the devices and components of the systems and subsystems. Therefore, the antennas needed for these systems require to be integrated within the same fabrication processes and technologies as the sensing and power converting devices that are used at their terminals. This doctoral thesis has focused on the development of integrated antenna arrays at Terahertz frequencies for imaging applications, for both near-field and focal-plane geometries, with a special emphasis on the technologies and the fabrication capabilities that can be potentially used and are currently available. The current imaging systems require large arrays of antennas in order to achieve the high-speed image acquisition that is required in most THz applications. This fact increases considerably the difficulty and complexity to achieve highly integrated and efficient antennas. This thesis has characterized and analyzed these difficulties and provided solutions to the development of antenna arrays at millimeter and submillimeter wave frequencies. The first part of this thesis has focused on the study of a planar antenna array, called retina, for a specific near-field imaging system based on the Modulated Scatterer Technique (MST) at millimeter and submillimeter-wave frequencies. This system has been selected for its capabilities to perform high-speed imaging and because it does not require a high frequency distribution line network. However, it is hindered by many technological difficulties: the selection of an antenna geometry that achieves high efficiency, the selection of the adequate active element and its integration with the antenna. In this thesis, these challenges have been addressed and studied in-depth, and a design methodology that integrates all the different aspects of the system has been developed. Because planar antennas at millimeter and submillimeter wave frequencies suffer from high losses due to the surface wave modes inside substrate, these losses have been analyzed and quantified for different antennas, and an antenna geometry that reduces significantly this problem has been developed. Different switching technologies currently or potentially available at these high frequencies have been considered in order to study and analyze their capabilities and their integration possibilities: PIN diodes, Schottky diodes and RF-MEMS. These technologies have been studied through the development of three retina prototypes, which have been fabricated using high precision fabrication processes such as laser micromachining and photolithographic. Different measurement set ups were fabricated and assembled to validate the different premises presented. The second part of the thesis is devoted to the study of integrated Focal Plane Arrays (FPA). The development of FPA at submillimeter wave frequencies is highly on demand due to the enormous progress in designing integrated heterodyne receivers. These receivers integrate arrays of submillimeter-wave diode-based mixers and multipliers with Monolithically Integrated Circuit (<b>MIC)</b> <b>amplifiers</b> on the same wafer stack. For this stackable multi-pixel terahertz camera technology to work, a leaky wave antenna with silicon micro-lenses has been developed, which allows wafer level integration compatible with silicon micro-fabrication techniques for bulk array manufacturing and has high directivity in order to illuminate a reflector efficiently. Detailed and thorough design guidelines for this antenna are presented. Two antenna prototypes were built in order to evaluate the two fabrication possibilities: advanced laser micro-fabrication and photolithographic fabrication. A study of the aberrations of the lens has been developed in order to evaluate the performance of the lens profile fabricated. Moreover, a set of radiation pattern measurements of the fabricated prototypes was performed in order to evaluate the performance of the antenna and its possibilities to be used as a FPA.
