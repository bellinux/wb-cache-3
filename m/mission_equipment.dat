5|$|As {{the program}} (and PAVN air defences) evolved, {{so did the}} relay aircraft. The EC-121Rs and their crews proved too {{vulnerable}} and were partly replaced in 1969 and 1970 by QU-22Bs (modified Beech A-36 Bonanzas) which were to be remotely piloted, and which had undergone primary <b>mission</b> <b>equipment</b> and PME flight tests at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in 1968. The aircraft suffered from mechanical difficulties, however, and were never flown during an operational mission without a pilot. They were replaced by C-130B models in December 1971.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirement}} to operate at an altitude of 24,000m (78,700ft) for 48 hours, Grob designed a twin-engined aircraft with a straight, very high aspect ratio wing of 56.5m (185ft 4½in) span. The wings featured winglets, and were mounted {{across the top of the}} fuselage which terminated in a T-tail configuration. The aircraft was designed to be crewed by two pilots, and could accommodate two scientists and associated <b>mission</b> <b>equipment</b> in a pressurised cabin. A galley, rest facilities and a toilet were provided.|$|E
25|$|In early 1996, {{the first}} OH-1 {{prototype}} was rolled out. On 6 August 1996, {{the first of}} four OH-1 prototypes (designated XOH-1) performed the type's maiden flight. All four prototypes were flying by March 1997. The four prototypes were delivered to the Japanese Defence Agency for service testing from June to August 1997. By April 1998, flight testing of the prototypes was reportedly around half way complete, having accumulated a combined 400 flight hours during testing, further tests focused on flight validation, operational evaluation, and <b>mission</b> <b>equipment</b> functionality. These four prototype aircraft were all later remanufactured to conform to production standards and redelivered under new serial numbers to the JGSDF.|$|E

On 28 March 2014, the Thai Army awarded a $34million contract to Airbus Helicopter for six UH-72As, fitted with a <b>mission</b> <b>equipment</b> package including the AN/ARC-231 airborne radio terminal; deliveries were to begin by April 2015. On 29 September 2014, Congress was notified of a Thailand request {{for the sale of}} another nine UH-72 Lakotas, related equipment, and support.

25|$|Eurocopter {{designed}} the EC155 originally with three configurations, however, another two configurations were added in 2005. The Passenger Transport version can carry 12 passengers in comfort seats or 13 passengers in utility seats, along with 1 or 2 crew. The VIP or Corporate Transport version has a VIP lounge with working space accommodating up to 8 executives. The Casualty Transport version can carry 2 stretchered patients {{with up to}} 4 seated medical staff, or 4 patients on stretchers plus 2 seated medical staff. The configurations added in 2005 were for Offshore operation and Police & Parapublic missions ranging from patrol, airborne surveillance, SAR and EMS, the helicopter being fitted with specific <b>mission</b> <b>equipment</b> for these duties.|$|E
25|$|The Aviation Section is {{equipped}} with four helicopters, providing law enforcement, search and rescue, and medevac service to the entire county: two twin-engine Eurocopter EC 145 and two single-engine Eurocopter AS-350B2 patrol helicopters. The SCPD was the first program {{in the country to}} operate the EC145. The aircraft is large enough and powerful enough to accommodate all of the LE, EMS and SAR <b>mission</b> <b>equipment</b> at once. The SCPD’s AS350 B2s primarily operate in the department’s law enforcement missions, but due to the aircraft’s cabin-size and flexibility, they are also able to fulfill EMS missions in a backup role. The Aviation Section maintains a base 24 hours per day at Long Island MacArthur Airport in Ronkonkoma and 16 hours per day at Gabreski Airport in Westhampton Beach.|$|E
25|$|On 22 October 2012, the USAF {{issued an}} RFP {{for up to}} 112 Combat Rescue Helicopters (CRH) to replace the HH-60G with the primary mission of {{personnel}} recovery from hostile territory; other missions include civil search and rescue, disaster relief, casualty and medical evacuation. It {{had to have a}} combat radius of , a payload of 1,500lb (680kg), and space for up to four stretchers. The AgustaWestland AW101 was one entrant. By December 2012, competitors AgustaWestland, EADS, Boeing, and Bell Helicopter had withdrawn amid claims that the RFP favored Sikorsky and did not reward rival aircraft's capabilities. The USAF argued that the competition was not written to favor Sikorsky, and that the terms were clear as to the capabilities they wanted and could afford. Sikorsky was the only bidder remaining, with subcontractor Lockheed Martin supplying <b>mission</b> <b>equipment</b> and the electronic survivability suite. Sikorsky and the USAF extensively evaluated the proposed CRH-60, a variant of the MH-60 special operations helicopter; the CRH-60 differed from the MH-60 by its greater payload and cabin capacity, wider rotor blades, and better hover capability.|$|E

500|$|The Fighting Falcon's key {{features}} include a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility, side-mounted control stick to ease control while maneuvering, a seat reclined 30 degrees {{to reduce the}} effect of g-forces on the pilot, and the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system which helps {{to make it a}} nimble aircraft. The F-16 has an internal M61 Vulcan cannon and 11 locations for mounting weapons and other <b>mission</b> <b>equipment.</b> The F-16's official name is [...] "Fighting Falcon", but [...] "Viper" [...] is commonly used by its pilots and crews, due to a perceived resemblance to a viper snake as well as the Colonial Viper starfighter on Battlestar Galactica.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the program}} was not problem-free. During late 2000, it was {{revealed}} that an effort to reduce the Comanche's empty weight by approximately [...] or 2.1 per cent in order to conform with its established target weight had been initiated. [...] The first Comanche prototype, serial 94-0327, completed 318 flights over 387 hours before reaching the end of its testing career during January2002. The second prototype, serial 95-0001, had accumulated 103.5 flight hours and 93 sorties by May2001. During late 2001 and early 2002, testing with the second RAH-66 was halted while the aircraft underwent extensive modifications, received both <b>mission</b> <b>equipment</b> and more powerful T800-LHT-801 engines. On 23 May 2002, the second prototype re-commenced flight testing with the additional equipment fitted. Accordingly, the expanded test programme involved new aspects such as the testing of the armaments and night vision systems; these test flights continued into 2003. During testing, the Comanche was recorded as having attained a cruise speed of , as well as having achieved a [...] "dash speed" [...] of perhaps one of its more atypical capabilities was the demonstrated ability to perform a 180° turn in under five seconds.|$|E
