50|$|A <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> (or more {{accurately}} dairy produce quota) {{was one of}} the measures used by governments in the European Union to intervene in agriculture. Their purpose was to bring rising milk production under control. Milk quotas were attached to land holdings, and they represented a cap on the amount of milk that a farmer could sell every year without paying a levy. Milk quotas were assets; they could be bought and sold, or acquired or lost by other means, and there was a market for them.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} dairy farmers has reduced to about 3,800 {{with an average}} herd size of 150 cows. The <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> is 1,142 tonnes. Danish dairy farmers are among {{the largest and most}} modern {{producers}} in Europe. More than half of the cows live in new loose-housing systems. Export of dairy products accounts for more than 20 per cent of the total Danish agricultural export. The total number of cattle in 2011 was approximately 1.5 million. Of these, 565,000 were dairy cows and 99,000 were suckler cows. The yearly number of slaughtering of beef cattle is around 550,000.|$|E
50|$|New Moor Farm, run by John Archer and {{his father}} Robert, {{previously}} kept Holstein Friesians but the herd {{was lost in the}} 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis. Today it is run by John and Susan Archer and is known in Darlington for its Archers ice cream which has been made on the premises in two converted garages and an old forge since 2004 using 4% of the milk from the Jersey herd of 330 cows. The cattle are descendants from three herds in Cornwall, Hampshire and Jersey. In summer 2005 an ice cream parlour was opened at the farm, and that Christmas it offered Christmas pudding ice cream. In 2005 the farm sold 4000 L of ice cream, and the following year it sold 8000 L. In 2006 the farm had a <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> of 1500000 L and it was processed by Acorn Dairy at Archdeacon Newton. In 2007 the farm supplied 90 litres of milk a day to Flamingoland to feed a new−born Rothschild giraffe which had been rejected by its mother. New Moor Farm was one of the farms which took part in the fourth annual Open Farm Sunday in May 2008. In 2008 the farm opened another ice cream parlour at The Station in Richmond. In 2009 the ice cream received the Taste of the North−East of England accreditation in the 2009 North−East England Tourism Awards. In 2010 a second business, Newmoor Veal, was started because the herd produces 150 male calves a year, many of which would previously be shot at birth because they are considered unsuitable for beef production. The new production company allows the veal calves to be suckled by their mothers and to live for seven months.|$|E

Investment shifts away from on-farm investment to off-farm investment.

40|$|End {{of project}} reportThe {{aim of the}} project was to produce quality, {{scientific}} based policy advice on the most efficient means for the transfer of <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> between dairy farmers. The main objective {{of the project was}} to identify <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> transfer mechanisms that would ensure the viability of the maximum number of farmers in Ireland while still supporting an internationally competitive agricultural sector. During the course of the project the Irish Department of Agriculture introduced a new <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> transfer scheme. The <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> exchange scheme was launched in November 2006. At this stage the objectives of the project were altered to be more policy relevant. Rather than exploring the efficiency of various <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> transfer models, the aim of the project was redirected to explore the efficiency of the scheme as it was operated in Ireland. The rationale for this change was to provide relevant and timely feedback to policy makers on the operation of the new scheme. While the MTR agreement guaranteed the continuation of the EU <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> regime until 2014 / 15, it also made provisions for a review of the <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> system to be conducted in 2008. Clearly any changes to EU <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> policy would have implications for farmers in Ireland. A second objective of this project was to explore some policy scenarios that may transpire from the <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> review and to estimate the implications for farmers in Ireland...|$|E

40|$|In Ireland, {{the trade}} of <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> is subject to {{regional}} restrictions and a large variation in quota prices between regions has caused some controversy. This article investigates this issue by analysing {{the functioning of the}} Irish <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> exchange market. For this purpose, the economic value of <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> is estimated using an optimisation framework. The estimated values are then compared to <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> prices paid at the exchange market. The analysis reveals that quota is undervalued in the border, midlands and west and south-west regions, while <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> is overvalued in the east and south regions. This implies that farmers in certain regions overpay for additional quota, while other farmers secure good value for their quota investments. The paper concludes by discussing that the identified regional differences are only partly explained by economic and production factors. peer-reviewe...|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of policy reforms such as the MTR of the CAP and WTO arrangements, many policy analysts are {{questioning}} the value of retaining the EU <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> system {{in its current form}} and one policy reform option that has been discussed in advance of the 2008 Health Check of the CAP is the international transfer of quota rights between member states. A methodology for simulating a free market for <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> is outlined in this paper with a view to extending the work to other member states to determine which member states would supply and demand <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> if an international market for quotas was established. The analysis, conducted for Ireland, uses National Farm Survey data from 491 dairy farms to estimate the aggregate demand for and supply of <b>milk</b> <b>quota.</b> A profit maximization model is used to simulate the production decisions of farmers and aggregation techniques are applied to arrive at national and regional demand and supply curves. Two policy scenarios are analysed; one assumes that there is no WTO reform and that the policies agreed under the MTR of the CAP in 2003 continue indefinitely, the second scenario assumes that a WTO agreement is reached and that export subsidies are phased out. The analysis also considers the effect of the Single Farm Payment on the market for <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> and a sensitivity analysis is conducted on the lifespan of the <b>milk</b> <b>quota.</b> The methodologies developed in this paper, offer policy makers in Ireland a useful tool to analyse the effect of imposing different constraints on the <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> market, be they regional, volume based or some other measures. The analysis also offer some insight into the capitalisation of policy measures into asset values; this is evident from the substantially lower market equilibrium price for quotas in a scenario where there is no export subsidies relative to a continuation of these policies and also from the effect of re-investment of the Single Farm Payment on quota values. The approach adopted is sufficiently general to be applied to FADN data for the major dairy producing countries in Europe to determine where milk production may move to if there was an international free market for quota rights.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} of {{an expansion of the}} EU <b>milk</b> <b>quota.</b> The paper begins by examining the relative competitiveness of dairy farming in the EU. FADN data is used to derive production cost measures and partial productivity indicators for selected Member States. The results show that Irish dairy farmers have relatively low cash costs of production and that output per hectare and per labour unit is low, suggesting that Ireland may be well placed to expand production if the <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> regime were reformed. The subsequent sections of the paper address {{the implications of}} an expansion of the EU <b>milk</b> <b>quota.</b> Results of an analysis conducted using the FAPRI-Ireland partial equilibrium model are summarised while the results and methods of a farm level analysis are discussed in more detail. The FAPRI-Ireland farm level model integrates econometric and linear programming modelling to simulate the farmer behaviour. Results suggest that the majority of Irish farmers would benefit from <b>milk</b> <b>quota</b> expansion, although {{the extent to which they}} would benefit largely depends on the availability and price of traded quota in their local quota market.
