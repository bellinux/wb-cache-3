40|$|OBJECTIVE: The human {{mesentery}} is now {{regarded as}} contiguous from the duodenojejunal (DJ) to anorectal level. This interpretation prompts re-appraisal of computed tomography (CT) {{images of the}} mesentery. METHODS: A digital model and reference atlas of the mesentery were generated using the full-colour data set of the Visible Human Project (VHP). Seventy one normal abdominal CT images were examined to identify mesenteric regions. CT appearances were correlated with cadaveric and histological appearances at corresponding levels. RESULTS: Ascending, descending and sigmoid <b>mesocolons</b> were identifiable in 75...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Intussusception {{is one of}} {{the less}} common causes of {{intestinal}} obstruction among adults. It is usually covert (concealed) in its clinical presentation. The ileo-colic type with accompanying anal protrusion is extremely rare. The case at hand is that of both an ileo-colic intussusception with anal protrusion, {{in the presence of a}} persistence of both the ascending and descending mesocolons; a case possibly yet to be documented in literature. Case presentation A 32 year-old African-Ugandan woman presented with complaints of a mass protruding per anus for 2 weeks. It was reducible and associated with colicky abdominal pain, loose stools, and bloody-mucoid discharge per anus. She had previously had a one and a half month’s history of abdominal pain; periodically continuous, while other times colicky in character. Examination and investigations revealed an intussusception with a partial intestinal obstruction. At laparotomy she was found to have an ileo-colic intussusception with a freely mobile colon throughout its length. There were persistent ascending and descending <b>mesocolons,</b> and absent hepatocolic and splenocolic ligaments. The intussusceptum was ‘milked’ but not completely reducible. A right hemicolectomy was done, with ileo-transverse colonic anastomosis. Histopathological examination revealed no preexisting pathologic lesion as a lead point. Conclusion The persistence of the ascending and descending <b>mesocolons</b> (azygosis) best explains the anal protrusion of an ileo-colic intussusception with partial obstruction. In this case zygosis (normal retroperitoneal ascending and descending colonic positioning) failed embryologically. This experience is particularly beneficial to general surgeons, radiologists, gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons and pathologists. </p...|$|R
2500|$|During these {{topographic}} changes, the dorsal mesentery undergoes corresponding changes. Most anatomical and embryological textbooks {{say that}} after adopting a final position, the ascending and descending <b>mesocolons</b> disappear during embryogenesis. Embryology—An Illustrated Colour Text says, [...] "most of the mid-gut retains the original dorsal mesentery, though parts of the duodenum derived from the mid-gut do not. The mesentery associated with the ascending colon and descending colon is resorbed, bringing these parts of the colon into close contact with the body wall." [...] In The Developing Human, the author states, [...] "the mesentery of the ascending colon fuses with the parietal peritoneum on this wall and disappears; consequently the ascending colon also becomes retroperitoneal". To reconcile these differences, several theories of embryologic mesenteric development—including the [...] "regression" [...] and [...] "sliding" [...] theories—have been proposed, but none has been widely accepted.|$|R
25|$|The <b>mesocolon</b> regions were {{traditionally}} {{taught to}} be separate sections with separate insertions into the posterior abdominal wall. In 2012, the first detailed observational and histological {{studies of the}} <b>mesocolon</b> were undertaken and this revealed several new findings. The study included 109 patients undergoing open, elective, total abdominal colectomy. Anatomical observations were recorded during the surgery and on the post-operative specimens.|$|E
25|$|Flexural anatomy is {{frequently}} {{described as a}} difficult area. It is simplified when each flexure is considered as being centered on a mesenteric contiguity. The ileocaecal flexure arises {{at the point where}} the ileum is continuous with the caecum around the ileocaecal mesenteric flexure. Similarly, the hepatic flexure is formed between the right <b>mesocolon</b> and transverse <b>mesocolon</b> at the mesenteric confluence. The colonic component of the hepatic flexure is draped around this mesenteric confluence. Furthermore, the splenic flexure is formed by the mesenteric confluence between the transverse and left <b>mesocolon.</b> The colonic component of the splenic flexure occurs lateral to the mesenteric confluence. At every flexure, a continuous peritoneal fold lies outside the colonic/mesocolic complex tethering this to the posterior abdominal wall.|$|E
25|$|The sigmoid <b>mesocolon</b> is {{that region}} of the {{mesentery}} to which the sigmoid colon is attached at the gastrointestinal mesenteric margin.|$|E
25|$|The {{appendix}} {{is connected}} to the mesentery in the lower region of the ileum, by a short region of the <b>mesocolon</b> known as the mesoappendix.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{teaching}} {{had described}} the <b>mesocolon</b> as a fragmented structure {{with all the}} named parts—the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid mesocolons, mesoappendix, and mesorectum as separately terminating their insertion into the posterior abdominal wall. In 2012, following detailed microscopic and electron microscopic examinations, the <b>mesocolon</b> was {{shown to be a}} single, continuous structure that commenced from the duodenojejunal flexure and extended {{to the level of the}} distal mesorectum. This simpler concept has enabled substantial advances to be made in different aspects of surgery on the colon and rectum. It has also had implications for sciences related to surgery, anatomy, and development.|$|E
25|$|These {{studies showed}} that the <b>mesocolon</b> is {{continuous}} from the ileocaecal to the rectosigmoid level. It was also shown that a mesenteric conﬂuence occurs at the ileocaecal and rectosigmoid junctions, {{as well as at}} the hepatic and splenic ﬂexures and that each confluence involves peritoneal and omental attachments. The proximal rectum was shown to originate at the conﬂuence of the mesorectum and mesosigmoid. A plane occupied by perinephric fascia was shown to separate the entire apposed small intestinal mesentery and the <b>mesocolon</b> from the retroperitoneum. Deep in the pelvis, this fascia coalesces to give rise to presacral fascia.|$|E
25|$|The {{lower part}} of the right half, below the {{transverse}} colon, is covered by peritoneum continuous with the inferior layer of the transverse <b>mesocolon,</b> and is in contact with the coils of the small intestine.|$|E
25|$|The mesoappendix is {{the portion}} of the <b>mesocolon</b> {{connecting}} the ileum to the appendix. It may extend to the tip of the appendix. It encloses the appendicular artery and vein, as well as lymphatic vessels, nerves, and often a lymph node.|$|E
25|$|The frontal {{margin of}} the {{pancreas}} separates the anterior from the inferior surface of the pancreas, and along this border the two layers of the transverse <b>mesocolon</b> diverge from one another, one passing upward over the frontal surface, the other backward over the inferior surface.|$|E
25|$|Interposed {{between the}} hepatic and splenic flexures, the greater omentum adheres to the {{transverse}} colon along a further band or fold of peritoneum. Dissection through this allows {{access to the}} cephalad (top) surface of the transverse <b>mesocolon.</b> Focal adhesions frequently tether the greater omentum to the cephalad aspect of the transverse <b>mesocolon.</b> The left colon {{is associated with a}} similar anatomic configuration of peritoneal folds; the splenic peritoneal fold is contiguous with the left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold at the splenic flexure. Division of the latter similarly allows for the separation of the left colon and associated mesentery off the underlying fascia and frees it from the retroperitoneum. The left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold continues distally at the lateral aspect of the mobile component of the mesosigmoid.|$|E
25|$|The {{rationalization}} of mesenteric and peritoneal fold anatomy {{permits the}} surgeon to differentiate both from intraperitoneal adhesions—also called congenital adhesions. These are highly variable among patients and occur in several locations. Congenital adhesions occur between the lateral {{aspect of the}} peritoneum overlying the mobile component of the mesosigmoid, and the parietal peritoneum in the left iliac fossa. During lateral to medial approach of mobilizing of the mesosigmoid, these must be divided first before the peritoneum proper can be accessed. Similarly, focal adhesions occur between the undersurface of the greater omentum and the cephalad aspect of the transverse <b>mesocolon.</b> These can be accessed after dividing the peritoneal fold that links the greater omentum and transverse colon. Adhesions here must be divided to separate the greater omentum off the transverse <b>mesocolon,</b> thus allowing access to the lesser sac proper.|$|E
25|$|Descriptions of the <b>mesocolon</b> by Toldt, Congdon, and Dodds {{have largely}} been ignored in {{mainstream}} literature until recently. A formal appraisal of the mesenteric organ anatomy was conducted in 2012; it echoed the findings of Toldt, Congdon, and Dodds. The single greatest advance in this regard was {{the identification of the}} mesenteric organ as being contiguous, as it spans the gastrointestinal tract from duodenojejunal flexure to mesorectal level.|$|E
25|$|Recent radiologic appraisals of the {{mesenteric}} organ {{have been}} conducted {{in the context of}} the contemporary understanding of mesenteric organ anatomy. When this organ is divided into non-flexural and flexural regions, these can readily be differentiated in most patients on CT imaging. Clarification of the radiological appearance of the human mesentery resonates with the suggestions of Dodd and enables a clearer conceptualization of mesenteric derangements in disease states. This is of immediate relevance in the spread of cancer from colon cancer and perforated diverticular disease, and in pancreatitis where fluid collections in the lesser sac dissect the <b>mesocolon</b> from the retroperitoneum and thereby extend distally within the latter.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the editor}} of Gray's Anatomy Professor Susan Standring, {{mesentery}} has been known for thousands of years. The classical anatomical description of the <b>mesocolon</b> is credited to British surgeon Sir Frederick Treves in 1885, although a description of the membrane as a single structure dates back to at least Leonardo da Vinci. Treves is known for performing the first appendectomy in England in 1888; he was surgeon to both Queen Victoria and King Edward VII. He studied the human mesentery and peritoneal folds in 100 cadavers and described the right and left mesocolons as vestigial or absent in the human adult. Accordingly, the small intestinal mesentery, transverse, and sigmoid mesocolons all terminated or attached at their insertions into the posterior abdominal wall. These assertions were included in mainstream surgical, anatomical, embryological, and radiologic literature for more than a century.|$|E
2500|$|Almost 10 {{years before}} Treves, the Austrian anatomist Carl Toldt {{described}} {{the persistence of}} all portions of the <b>mesocolon</b> into adulthood. [...] Toldt was professor of anatomy in Prague and Vienna; he published {{his account of the}} human mesentery in 1879. Toldt identified a fascial plane between the <b>mesocolon</b> and the underlying retroperitoneum, formed by the fusion of the visceral peritoneum of the <b>mesocolon</b> with the parietal peritoneum of the retroperitoneum; this later became known as Toldt's fascia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transverse}} colon including the colic flexures and transverse <b>mesocolon</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{right and}} left mesocolons persisted into {{adulthood}} and remained separate from the retroperitoneum—extraretroperitoneal. Radiologist Wylie J. Dodds described this concept in 1986. Dodds extrapolated that unless the <b>mesocolon</b> remained an extraretroperitoneal structure—separate from the retroperitoneum—only then would the radiologic appearance of the mesentery and peritoneal folds be reconciled with actual anatomy.|$|E
2500|$|Understanding the {{macroscopic}} {{structure of}} the mesenteric organ meant that associated structures—the peritoneal folds and congenital and omental adhesions—could be better appraised. The small intestinal mesenteric fold occurs where the small intestinal mesentery folds onto the posterior abdominal wall and continues laterally as the right <b>mesocolon.</b> During mobilization of the small intestinal mesentery from the posterior abdominal wall, this fold is incised, allowing access to the interface between the small intestinal mesentery and the retroperitoneum. The fold continues at the inferolateral boundary of the ileocaecal junction and turns [...] as the right paracolic peritoneal fold. This fold is divided during lateral to medial mobilization, permitting the surgeon to serially lift the right colon and associated mesentery off the underlying fascia and retroperitoneum. At the hepatic flexure, the right lateral peritoneal fold turns and continues medially as the hepatocolic peritoneal fold. Division of the fold in this location permits separation of the colonic component of the hepatic flexure and <b>mesocolon</b> off the retroperitoneum.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transverse}} colon {{is the part}} of the colon from the hepatic flexure to the splenic flexure (the turn of the colon by the spleen). The {{transverse colon}} hangs off the stomach, attached to it by a large fold of peritoneum [...] called the greater omentum. On the posterior side, the transverse colon is connected to the posterior abdominal wall by a mesentery known as the transverse <b>mesocolon.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{mesentery}} (...) is {{a continuous}} set of tissues which is {{formed by the}} double fold of peritoneum that attaches the intestines {{to the wall of}} the abdomen. The term mesentery is used for the small intestine and mesenteric organ is sometimes used to refer {{to the rest of the}} mesentery that incorporates the <b>mesocolon,</b> mesoappendix, mesosigmoid and mesorectum.
