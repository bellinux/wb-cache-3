40|$|Among {{the methods}} adopted for the curing {{of fish in}} India the {{practice}} of pit curing common {{in certain parts of}} the Madras State and the neighbouring region of Travancore is of considerable interest for several reasons.

The products possess a distinct flavour and taste much appreciated by some sections of the public in the eastern parts of Madras State.

Since pit curing forms one of the main methods of curing around Mandapam, it was considered desirable to undertake a comprehensive investigation of the local practices relating to this cure and the keeping quality of the products. A knowledge of the biochemical changes occurring during maturation under semi-anaerobic conditions which constitute the basis of this cure is necessary for obtaining a better product by this method...|$|R

Despite the longstanding availability of this strain, little is known about its thermoregulatory behavior. The aim of this study was to determine temperature preference in Hartley and Hairless guinea pigs by observing each strain in a ring-shaped apparatus containing a nonlinear temperature gradient. Temperatures were maintained by separately controlled heating <b>mats</b> <b>lining</b> the apparatus. Set point temperatures ranged from 24 to 38 °C. Guinea pigs (Hartley female, Hairless female, and Hairless male guinea pigs; n = 8 each group) were placed either singly or in pairs at 1 of the 8 randomized starting points within the apparatus. Subjects were observed for 30 min and coded for location within the temperature gradient by both frequency and duration. When placed singly in the apparatus, all 3 groups spent more time in the 30 °C zones. However, when placed as pairs with a cagemate, Hartley female guinea pigs spent more time in the cooler range of temperatures from 24 to 30 °C, whereas Hairless guinea pigs preferred a range of 30 to 38 °C. These results confirm a temperature preference of 30 ± 2 °C for both Hartley and Hairless guinea pigs when singly housed. However, data from the paired housing condition suggest that context plays an important role in thermoregulatory behavior...|$|R

50|$|Males {{sometimes}} bring nest {{material to}} the female, who {{does most of the}} building. She crushes twigs with her beak until they are pliable, then turns in the nest to bend the twigs around her body and push them into a cup shape with her feet. The cup has four layers: coarse twigs (and sometimes bits of trash) covered in a leafy <b>mat,</b> then <b>lined</b> with grapevine bark and finally grasses, stems, rootlets, and pine needles. The nest typically takes three to nine days to build; the finished product is 5.1 - 7.6 cm tall, 10.1 cm across, with an inner diameter of about 7.6 cm. Cardinals do not usually use their nests more than once. The female builds a cup nest in a well-concealed spot in dense shrub or a low tree 1 - 3 m off the ground. The nest is made of thin twigs, bark strips, and grasses, lined with grasses or other plant fibers. Eggs are laid one to six days following the completion of the nest. The eggs are white, with a tint of green, blue or brown, and are marked with lavender, gray, or brown blotches which are thicker around the larger end. The shell is smooth and slightly glossy. Three or four eggs are laid in each clutch. Eggs measure approximately 26 x 19 mm in size. The female generally incubates the eggs, though, rarely, the male will incubate for brief periods of time. Incubation takes 12 to 13 days. Young fledge 10 to 11 days after hatching. Two to three, and even four, broods are raised each year. The male cares for and feeds each brood as the female incubates the next clutch of eggs.|$|R
40|$|Nanofibres {{having a}} {{parallel}} line surface texture were electrospun from {{cellulose acetate butyrate}} solutions using a solvent mixture of acetone and N, N'-dimethylacetamide. The formation mechanism of the unusual surface feature was explored and attributed {{to the formation of}} voids on the jet surface at the early stage of electrospinning and subsequent elongation and solidification of the voids into a line surface structure. The fast evaporation of a highly volatile solvent, acetone, from the polymer solution was found to {{play a key role in}} the formation of surface voids, while the high viscosity of the residual solution after the solvent evaporation ensured the line surface to be maintained after the solidification. Based on this principle, nanofibres having a similar surface texture were also electrospun successfully from other polymers, such as cellulose acetate, polyvinylidene fluoride, poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene), either from the same or from different solvent systems. Polarized Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to measure the polymer molecular orientation within nanofibres. Schwann cells were grown on both aligned and randomly oriented nanofibre <b>mats.</b> The parallel <b>line</b> surface texture assisted in the growth of Schwann cells especially at the early stage of cell culture regardless of the fibre orientation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prostatic androgen-repressed message- 1 (PARM- 1) {{has been}} cloned from the prostate. The {{transcript}} of the PARM- 1 gene is overexpressed during regression of the prostate after androgen withdrawal. The regulation of PARM- 1 by androgens is limited to this organ. We have studied the effects of PARM- 1 overexpression in malignant prostate cells. METHODS: The PARM- 1 cDNA was introduced into the rat cancer cell <b>line</b> <b>MAT</b> LyLu along with a doxycycline-dependent regulator. RESULTS: Maximal expression of PARM- 1 (fivefold induction) was achieved by incubating the cells with 2 microM doxycycline for 48 hr. A study investigating the effect of PARM- 1 overexpression on the transcription of 588 genes {{has shown that the}} TLP 1 gene (encoding rat telomerase protein component 1) was the most up-regulated (fourfold). In addition, a dose-dependent increase in telomerase activity was observed in cells overexpressing PARM- 1. In vivo, the androgen-deprived prostate showed an increased TLP 1 level and increased telomerase activity. CONCLUSIONS: Increased telomerase activity is often associated with the immortalisation of cancer cell lines, particularly prostatic ones. This could mean that PARM- 1 is involved, via increased telomerase activity, in a survival program enabling certain prostatic cells to resist apoptosis, thus conferring a selective advantage to pre-cancerous or cancerous cells.

40|$|Deep-sea {{hydrothermal}} vent systems are highly productive ecosystems, where reduced energy sources fuel complex communities of microorganisms, invertebrates and vertebrates. Since decades the oxidation of methane, hydrogen and inorganic sulfur compounds {{has been extensively}} studied. However, the role of inorganic nitrogen and of organic compounds as energy source has been investigated only scarcely in hydrothermal fluids, in particular at the sea floor, where hydrothermal fluids exit subsurface. The aim of my thesis was {{to shed light on}} these under-investigated topics. In my first project I studied nitrification and the involved microbes that are associated with large, nitrate-respiring and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) of the genus Beggiatoa. These SOB formed mats and covered sulfide- and ammonia-rich hydrothermal sediments in the Guaymas Basin. In these mats, nitrification rates were measured using 15 N-labeled ammonium. With up to 605 Mikromol N l- 1 mat d- 1 the nitrification rates were the highest measured for a deep-sea ecosystem. Diversity and quantitative PCR of the ammonia monooxygenase subunit A gene (amoA) indicated association of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) with Beggiatoa <b>mats.</b> In <b>line</b> with this, single cells of AOB and potentially ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaotes were attached to narrow Beggiatoa-like filaments. Nitrite oxidizing bacteria were also found. Nitrifying bacteria associated with Beggiatoa mats that respire nitrate to ammonium (DNRA) could display a syntrophic consortium that internally cycle nitrogen and thereby reduce loss of bioavailable nitrogen. However, {{it is not clear whether}} large SOB in general respire nitrate also to dinitrogen. Therefore, I analyzed the genetic potential of the large SOB 2 ̆ 2 Candidatus Thiomargarita nelsonii 2 ̆ 2, a close relative of Beggiatoa. The comparison to four other Beggiatoaceae identified genes for both denitrification and DNRA in 2 ̆ 2 Ca. T. nelsonii 2 ̆ 2 and three other Beggiatoaceae. This indicates that both pathways are widely distributed among large SOB and questions the hypothesis of internal N-cycling in mats of large SOB. In my third project I investigated the microbial consumption of organic compounds that are produced in hydrothermal systems. In particular I studied acetate-assimilating heterotrophic communities in the diffuse fluids (temperature range of 4 - 72 degree Celsius) of two rock-hosted hydrothermal systems. 16 S rRNA gene-based diversity analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that either Gammaproteobacteria or Epsilonproteobacteria rapidly grew during short-term (8 - 12 h) incubations with 13 C-acetate. Single cells of both groups incorporated 13 C-acetate as shown by nanoSIMS. Marinobacter spp. and a novel group among the Nautiliales could be heterotrophs in these systems. These are potential r-strategists that quickly respond to the fluctuating availabilities of energy sources in hydrothermal fluids...|$|R
40|$|Urokinase (uPA), {{a member}} of the serine {{protease}} family, and its cell surface receptor (uPAR) have been implicated in promoting the progression of various human malignancies including hormone dependent malignancies such as breast and prostate cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating uPA production in breast and prostate cancer progression are poorly understood. In the current studies, we have examined the role of uPAR in breast cancer progression by developing a homologous model of uPAR overexpression by a rat breast cancer cell <b>line</b> <b>Mat</b> B III. Overexpression of uPAR resulted in increased breast cancer growth, invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Development of this syngeneic breast cancer model allowed me to examine the ability of the anti-estrogen, tamoxifen (TAM) and a synthetic active site inhibitor of uPA, 4 -iodo benzo[b]thiophene- 2 -carboxamidine (B- 428), to prevent breast cancer progression. TAM and B- 428 treatment alone or in combination effectively prevented breast tumor growth, invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Morever, TAM and B- 428 treatments caused a decrease in uPAR gene expression and protein production. These results underscore the utility of anti-proteolytic agents (B- 428) in addition to standard hormone therapy (TAM) in advanced breast cancer patients where the uPA/uPAR system {{plays a key role in}} tumor progression. Regulation of uPA production by androgens in prostate cancer was then examined in the androgen insensitive PC- 3 cells transfected with the functional human androgen receptor cDNA (PC- 3 T). Androgens down regulate uPA gene expression and protein production in androgen sensitive PC- 3 T cells. Furthermore, restoration of androgen responsiveness in PC- 3 T cells caused a dramatic decrease in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Due to the ability of sex steroids to inhibit uPA gene expression, I have also examined the correlation between hormone sensitivity and uPA expression in several hormone responsive (HR) and hormone insensitive (HI) breast and prostate cancer cell lines. uPA mRNA was expressed only in the highly invasive, HI breast (MDA- 231) and prostate (PC- 3) cell lines. Failure of uPA mRNA expression in the minimally invasive, HR breast (MCF- 7) and prostate (LnCAP) cells was due to transcriptional suppression of uPA gene. Southern blot analysis us...|$|R
40|$|Silver-Russell {{syndrome}} (SRS; OMIM # 180860) is a congenital imprinting disorder (ID) {{characterized by}} severe pre- and postnatal growth retardation. The main features of SRS include a typical triangular shaped facial gestalt, a relative macrocephaly and clinodactyly {{of the fifth}} digits. Additional findings are asymmetry of the body and/or the limbs and a failure to thrive during the first month. Currently, (epi) genetic alterations {{can be found in}} 65 - 70 % of patients suggestive for SRS. These findings comprise a hypomethylation of the H 19 imprinting control region (ICR 1) in up to 40 %, maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (upd(7) mat) in 7 % and chromosomal aberrations in 20 % of cases. Recently the focus of interest has shifted to a particular subgroup of patients with IDs, which exhibit additional epigenetic changes at other loci than the disease specific one. This finding has been called multilocus methylation defect (MLMD) and has meanwhile been identified in several IDs. Aim {{of this study was to}} identify the frequency and functional relevance of MLMD in SRS patients. In a group of 93 patients suggestive for SRS a MS-SNuPE-Assay (Methylation Specific - Single Nucleotide Primer Extension) was performed to identify changes in the methylation patterns of eight imprinted genes. The aforementioned SRS specific (epi) mutations have been previously excluded in these patients. In the current screening one patient could be identified to carry a slight reduction of methylation at the MEG 3 locus consistent with mosaicism for a Temple-syndrome deletion, an isolated imprinting defect or mosaic trisomy of chromosome 14 of maternal origin. In three further patients a hypermethylation of IGF 2 R with unknown significance could be detected. To study the functional impact of a genome mutation, gene expression analysis was performed on upd(7) <b>mat</b> fibroblast cell <b>lines.</b> These experiments enlightened the knowledge about the complex regulation and expression of imprinted genes involved in growth and development. Particularly the comparison between the functional outcome of a patient with segmental upd(7 q) mat and an hypomethylation of the MEG 3 -DMR on chromosome 14 with the upd(7) mat carriers was remarkable. An upregulation of COPG 2 and GRB 10 was observed. Furthermore, the patient with segmental upd(7 q) mat showed interesting effects on CDKN 1 C and PLAGL 1. The (epi) gentic characterization of MLMD patients revealed a high variability in their methylation patterns of imprinted genes. All of these patients showed SRS phenotype and a common loss of methylation at the ICR 1 and ICR 2 in 11 p 15. The gene expression studies demonstrated that the high variability found in the methylation patterns in MLMD patients result in a comparable variability in the expression of imprinted genes. A common effect was only observed in the reduced expression of CDKN 1 C. The investigations concerning structural variations of the chromosomal region 11 p 15 revealed the importance of rearrangements in that region for the regulation of genes related to growth and development. The resulting effect on the clinical outcome does not only depend on the gain or loss of coding material, but also affected cis-acting elements may have an influence on the expression and the methylation patterns of imprinted genes. For the evaluation of structural chromosomal alterations the size, breakpoints, included genes and parental origin of the affected region have to be considered...|$|R
