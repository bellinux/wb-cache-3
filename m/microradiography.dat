5000|$|Historadiography is a {{technique}} formerly utilized {{in the fields of}} histology and cellular biology to provide semiquantitative information regarding the density of a tissue sample. It is usually synonymous with <b>microradiography.</b> [...] This is achieved by layering a ground section of mineralized tissue (such as bone) with photographic emulsion on a glass slide and exposing the sample to a beam of X-rays. After developing the emulsion, the resulting radiograph can be viewed with a microscope. A side-by-side comparison with a slide containing radiographs of various substances of known mass can provide a rough mass estimate, and therefore a rough approximation of the concentration of calcium salts in the sample.|$|E
50|$|An {{autoradiograph}} is {{an image}} on an x-ray film or nuclear emulsion produced by the pattern of decay emissions (e.g., beta particles or gamma rays) from a distribution of a radioactive substance. Alternatively, the autoradiograph is also available as a digital image (digital autoradiography), due to the recent development of scintillation gas detectors or rare earth phosphorimaging systems. The film or emulsion is apposed to the labeled tissue section to obtain the autoradiograph (also called an autoradiogram). The auto- prefix indicates that the radioactive substance is within the sample, as distinguished from the case of historadiography or <b>microradiography,</b> in which the sample is X-rayed using an external source. Some autoradiographs can be examined microscopically for localization of silver grains (such as on the interiors or exteriors of cells or organelles) in which the process is termed micro-autoradiography. For example, micro-autoradiography {{was used to examine}} whether atrazine was being metabolized by the hornwort plant or by epiphytic microorganisms in the biofilm layer surrounding the plant.|$|E

Its main characteristics – i. e. high spatial resolution {{on a large}} field of view, wide dynamic range, versatility and simplicity of use – make it a high performance {{imaging detector}} for applications in X-ray microscopy, photonic devices, Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) lithography, and materials science, {{as well as in}} the characterization of intense X-ray sources, including Free Electron Laser (FEL). The peculiarities of the LiF imaging detector overcome some of the limitations of other commonly used ones, and can be exploited for X-ray microscopy in very simple configurations, such as lensless techniques, even for in vivo investigations of biological samples. Advanced optical microscopy techniques have been used to obtain highly–resolved <b>microradiographies</b> of biological specimens, performed in absorption contrast mode. Its peculiarities seem suitable also for use in phase-contrast experiments. The LiF-based detector versatility allows improvements in order to optimize its response and sensitivity...|$|R

Due to potential {{side effects of}} HRT, natural alternatives are appealing. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether Cimicifuga racemosa extract BNO 1055 improves metaphyseal fracture healing in severe osteopenic bone in rats. Thirty-three twelve-week-old female rats developed severe osteopenia during ten weeks after ovariectomy. After metaphyseal tibial-osteotomy and standardized T-plate-osteosynthesis healing-period in ovariectomized rats(C), 17 -β-estradiol-(E) and Cimicifuga racemosa-(CR) supplemented diets were assessed for 35 days. Changes in callus-morphology were evaluated qualitatively by biomechanical testing and quantitatively in <b>microradiographies</b> and fluorochrome-labeled histological sections. CR-supplementation slightly improved callus quality and trabecular bone-formation. It significantly enhanced endosteal callus density (Cl. Dn. e C: 59. 08 ± 21. 89, E: 45. 95 ± 18. 39, CR: 60. 85 ∆± 18. 66), though most of the other morphological parameters examined showed no improvement. Time-course of fracture healing did not change due to CR. Estrogen-supplementation enhanced biomechanical properties of fracture-site. Trabecular bone was improved indicating the physiological endosteal healing process. CR-supplementation did not exhibit positive effects in severe (senile) osteopenic fracture healing as seen in early (postmenopausal) osteoporosis in rats.

40|$|Despite its 5 meters long, the {{megamouth shark}} (Megachasma pelagios) {{is one of}} the rarest types of sharks known in the world {{recently}} discovered in 1983 (only 54 specimens observed and documented so far). This filter shark has been described many times as possessing a luminous mouth used as a lure trap or for social recognition. However, none histological study has been realized to confirm these assumptions so far. Two hypotheses about the light production arose notably from video recording observations: (i) the light may be produced by bioluminescence inside its mouth or on the white band of its upper jaw; (ii) light can be due to the reflection on this white band. Given {{the fact that we had}} the opportunity to analyze mouth tissues from one individual, the aim of the current study is to test these hypotheses by highlighting the presence of light organs (photophores) or specialized light-reflective structures. Up to now, the study of skin tissues from 11 sites (8 around and inside the mouth, 3 control sites: on the back, the belly and the pectoral fins) performed thanks to several techniques (histological sections, CT-scan, <b>microradiographies,</b> SEM, cryofractures and spectrophotometer) do not indicate the presence of any photophores. However, dermal denticles (calcified structures on shark skin) embedded into the white band are likely involved in reflection of light. Still, the observation of a living individual and the study of fresh or well-fixed and conserved tissues are essential to determine if this shark is bioluminescent and to confirm if it is able to reflect light...|$|R

MethodDigital X-ray <b>microradiography</b> {{was used to}} quantify the subchondral bone mineral content (BMC) in the medial tibial plateau. Accuracy and reproducibility of the method were determined in 22 samples from C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6 Brd;B 6 Dnk;B 6 N-Tyrc-Brd) wild-type mice. The method was then validated in wild-type mice that had undergone surgical destabilisation of medial meniscus (DMM) and in a genetically modified mouse strain with an established increase in trabecular bone mass. ResultsThe measurement of subchondral BMC by digital X-ray <b>microradiography</b> had a coefficient of variation of 3. 6 %. Digital X-ray <b>microradiography</b> was able to demonstrate significantly increased subchondral BMC in the medial tibial plateau of male mice 4 and 8 weeks after DMM surgery and in female mice 8 weeks after surgery. Furthermore, digital X-ray <b>microradiography</b> also detected the increase in subchondral BMC in a genetically modified mouse strain with high trabecular bone mass.

40|$|Introduction. Does {{high-resolution}} {{visualization of}} microcalcifications improve diagnostic reliability? Method. X-rays were taken of mamma specimens with microcalcifications in 32 patients (10 malignant; 22 benign) using conventional radiography (12 [*]Lp/mm) and high-resolution radiography (2000 [*]Lp/mm). Histological sections were subsequently prepared and correlated to the microradiographic image and every calcification was assigned an exact malignant or benign histological diagnosis. Five radiologists classified single groups of calcifications in both methods {{according to the}} BIRADS classification system. Results. Using <b>microradiography</b> microcalcifications can be shown in high resolution at the cell level including histological correlation. In some cases, the diagnostic validity was improved by the high resolution in <b>microradiography.</b> In other cases, the high resolution resulted in more visible calcifications, thus giving benign calcifications a malignant appearance. In the BIRADS 2 and 3 group, the probability of malignancy was 28. 6 % in the conventional radiography evaluation and 37. 8 % in the <b>microradiography</b> evaluation. In the BIRADS 4 and 5 group, the probability of malignancy was 34. 2 % in the conventional radiography evaluation and 24. 4 % in the <b>microradiography</b> evaluation. The differences were not significant. Summary. Overall, the improved resolution in <b>microradiography</b> did not show an improvement in diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional radiography...|$|E

40|$|Die Ätiologie der Periimplantitis ist insbesondere auf dem genetischen Level weitgehend unbekannt. Diese Arbeit untersuchte immundefiziente Tiere um die Fachkenntnisse zur Entstehung und zum Verlauf der Periimplantitis mit ihren Wirtsfaktoren zu verbessern und um ferner Therapieoptionen zu evaluieren. Für diesen tierexperimentellen Versuch wurden in 40 Mäusen Titannägel (FRIOS®) median am Gaumen direkt hinter den oberen Schneidezähnen inseriert. Es erfolgte eine Einteilung in 4 Gruppen. 20 Mäuse gehörten dem Inzuchtstamm der Art C 57 BL/ 6 N (Normal) an. Weitere 20 Mäuse waren Knockoutmäuse (NOD 2 -defizient). Bei 20 Versuchstieren, jeweils bei 10 Mäusen der Art C 57 BL/ 6 N und bei 10 Knockoutmäusen der Art NOD 2, wurden die Membran-Nägel zusätzlich mit einer Ligatur versehen. Die restlichen 10 Tiere der beiden Gruppen dienten jeweils als Kontrollgruppe. Nach 6 Wochen erfolgten Histologie und Radiologie. Es konnte eine reproduzierbare Implantatinseration mit dem Hervorrufen einer Periimplantitis im Knockoutmausmodell erreicht werden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Implantate mit Ligaturen klinisch, radiologisch sowie histologisch eine signifikant höhere periimplantäre Destruktion mit Implantatverlust induzieren, als die jeweiligen Kontrollgruppen. Ein Rückschluss der gewählten Immundefizienz NOD 2 der Knockoutmäuse auf die Periimplantitis konnte nicht gezogen werden. Development, {{progression}} {{and therapy}} are the mainly unsolved uprising {{problems in the}} periimplantitis. Periodontal disease models are established in knock-out mice. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the basics and the development of the periimplantitis, based on a prior study „A knock-out model for Periimplantitis“. This work considered immune deficient knockout animals to improve the knowledge for the origin and the process of Periimplantitis with their host factors. In 40 mice, 20 normal (C 57 BL/ 6 N) and 20 advertises knockout mice (NOD 2 -defizient), titanium implants (FRIOS®) in the area of the upper jaw directly behind the front teeth were inserated. With 10 mice of each of the two tribes the implants were provided in addition with ligatures so that altogether 4 groups could be formed (C 57 BL/ 6 N implant as a control group, C 57 BL/ 6 N implant and ligature, knockout implant as a control group, knockout implant and ligature). The 40 mice were fed with a special diet enriched with sugar and flavor under a steady weight check over a period of 6 weeks, then killed by means of a cervical dislocation. The specimens were processed histologically and <b>microradiographies</b> were prepared. The results show that implants with ligatures induce a significantly higher periimplantitis bone defect than the respective control groups. The micro radiological examinations confirm this results. At the end of the observation period, the portion of implants lost was higher in the ligature group. Indeed in the normal mouse groups as well as in the knockout mouse tribes as many implants were lost, what implies that the chosen immune-deficiency of the knockout mice does not have influence on the periimplantitis. Nevertheless this test confirms that an induce of a periimplantitis also is possible in the knockout mice model...|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES. The {{application}} of various high-resolution (< 100 [micro]m) imaging techniques for in vitro bone mineral analysis is explored. METHODS. The techniques of contact <b>microradiography</b> and microtomography, using the x-ray spectrum filtered out of synchrotron radiation (SR) and conventional staining techniques, are compared {{to each other}} by presenting {{a variety of different}} samples. The relationship between radiation exposure and spatial resolution micro-computed tomography (CT) images of a finger bone is explored. The relevant properties of SR are explained. RESULTS. In CT images, a spatial resolution of 100 [micro]m was obtained. New bone mineral induced by mechanical periosteal irritation in a rabbit tibia was quantified. In one case a microradiogram and a microtomogram of the same slice were taken for comparison. Histologic sections and miroradiograms taken from a specimen of a human femur for comparison are presented. CONCLUSIONS. <b>Microradiography</b> and staining techniques require rather sophisticated sample preparation; quantitative image analysis is more difficult as the resulting image must be digitized. The CT technique requires almost no sample preparation and allows for accurate bone mineral quantification. However, CT images with a resolution of several microns limit the sample size to a few mm. Micro-CT and <b>microradiography</b> can be performed with conventional x-ray sources, but the use of SR is of particular interest in high resolution imaging, because its white spectrum allows for optimum x-ray energy selection and its high intensity for short scan times...|$|E
40|$|Detection of occlusal caries {{with visual}} {{examination}} using ICDAS correlates strongly with histology under stereomicroscopy (SM), but dentin aspects under SM are ambiguous regarding mineral content. Thus, our {{aim was to}} test two null hypotheses: SM and <b>microradiography</b> result in similar correlations between ICDAS and histology; SM and <b>microradiography</b> result in similar positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of ICDAS cut-off 1 - 2 (scores 0 - 2 as sound) with histological threshold D 3 (demineralization in the inner third of dentin). Occlusal surfaces of extracted permanent teeth (n = 115) were scored using ICDAS. Undemineralized ground sections were histologically scored using both SM without contrast solution and <b>microradiography</b> after immersion in Thoulet's solution 1. 47 for 24 h (MRC). Correlation between ICDAS and histology differed from SM (0. 782) to MRC (0. 511) (p = 0. 0002), with a large effect size "q" of 0. 49 (95 % CI: 0. 638 / 0. 338). For ICDAS cut-off 1 - 2 and D 3, PPV from MRC (0. 56) was higher than that from SM (0. 28) (p< 0. 00001; effect size h = 0. 81), and NPV from MRC (0. 72) was lower than that from SM (1, 00) (p < 0. 00001; effect size h = 1. 58).

Here, stereomicroscopy of wet (SW) and dry (SD) ground sections of natural occlusal caries lesions resulted in moderate (0. 7, for normal dentin) and low accuracies (< 0. 6, for carious and sclerotic dentin) as validated by contrast-corrected <b>microradiography.</b> Accuracies of PLMQ were moderate for both normal (0. 71) and carious dentin (0. 71). The hypothesis that detection of dentin reactions by SM and PLMQ would be influenced by the contrast quality of micrographic images was rejected. Dentin reactions were scored by SW, SD, PLMQ, and three types of microradiographic images with varying contrast qualities and each technique was compared against the one that resulted in the highest number of scores for each dentin reaction. Large differences resulted, mainly related to the detection of sclerotic dentin by both SW and SD, and normal and carious dentin by PLMQ.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{experimental}} techniques utilized {{to assess the}} de- or remineralization of enamel or dentin in intra-oral studies. In in situ studies, {{it is important for}} one to know how much mineral has been lost or gained, and where the loss or gain occurred. The main emphasis in this paper is on techniques suitable for direct or indirect mineral quantification. The measuring techniques considered are <b>microradiography,</b> iodine absorptiometry, various microhardness tests, polarized light, light-scattering, iodide permeability, and wet chemical analysis. The various techniques are compared concerning suitability for the determination of mineral content in vol% (or wt%), mineral changes in vol% mu-m (or kg. m- 2), and mineral distributions. Furthermore, sample preparation, the importance of protein penetration, nominal mineral loss range, the estimated mineral loss threshold, and the applicability to dentin are compared and considered.

The fluorescence analysis was performed at an emission of over 515 nm due to 450 nm – 490 nm excitation and an emission of over 615 nm due to 530 nm – 585 nm excitation. The fluorescence scans corresponded to the mineral loss profiles {{as well as to the}} microhardness profiles and the carious expansion seen in the histological analysis. The differences between the two tested fluorescence filter systems were very small. The correlation between lesion depth, derived from microhardness testing and <b>microradiography,</b> and fluorescence plots were between 0. 85 and 0. 90. The results for histopathology were even better. It can be concluded from these outcomes that fluorescence can be used as a marker for carious dentine...|$|E
40|$|Tetracyclines {{are easily}} {{incorporated}} into bone; whether bone formation is impaired {{during this process}} is still a matter of debate. We therefore studied, by histomorphometry, fluorescence microscopy, and <b>microradiography,</b> a sample of trabecular bone from a patient with a total hip arthroplasty, treated without interruption for 3. 5 years with doxycycline because of a pertrochanteric abscess. Absence of osteomalacia and a low-mineralization score of {{the edges of the}} trabeculae similar to that observed in a control group of 12 subjects suggest no interference by doxycycline with calcium deposition in bone...|$|E
40|$|Composite restorations {{are prone}} to develop {{secondary}} caries if a gap exists between tissue and restoration. The aim {{of this article was}} to quantify the effects of a fluoridating and non-F composite on secondary dentine caries in vitro as a function of time. The mineral loss in dentine was assessed in an artificial gap of 200 mu m width at the composite/dentine interface; the samples were demineralised in a carboxymethylcellulose gel (pH = 5, 37 degrees C) for 8 weeks. Once a week the mineral content of the samples was determined using non-destructive wavelength-independent <b>microradiography</b> (WIM). After 8 weeks transversal <b>microradiography</b> (TMR) was done on the samples to investigate the mineral distribution of the dentine lesions. The WIM results show that the fluoride-releasing composite decreased the dentine demineralisation statistically significantly with respect of the non-F control by approximately 45 %. The mineral loss values are found to be strictly proportional to time; the demineralisation reduction is expected to continue over extended periods of clinical relevance. The TMR results show that the fluoridating composite reduced the mineral loss values significantly with respect to the non-F control by approximately 55 %, but had a negligible effect on the lesion depth values. This study indicates that WIM is an accurate and reliable technique to measure in vitro secondary dentine caries next to a composite restoration as a function of time...|$|E
40|$|Undecalcified {{transverse}} sections through the midshaft of tibias from kittens dosed {{with high levels}} of vitamin A, and from kittens recovering from such treatment, were examined by in vivo labelling with fluorescent dyes and by <b>microradiography.</b> During treatment subperiosteal bone deposition was retarded while intraosseous and subendosteal bone formation were relatively unaffected; normal bone resorption, responsible for shaft remodelling, was also inhibited. In kittens labelled during the recovery period, both formation of bone by the periosteum and resorption of the original compacta were greater than normal. These results illustrate that rapid compensatory activity occurs in bones following vitamin A toxicosis...|$|E
40|$|Acid gel caries lesions {{were created}} in 3, 100 human and bovine enamel {{specimens}} and studied with transverse <b>microradiography.</b> Small, significant differences were found. Human enamel lesions {{were found to be}} less demineralized, shallower, had a higher ratio of integrated mineral loss (ΔZ) to lesion depth (L), a lower degree of surface zone mineralization (SZmax) and showed less variability than those in bovine enamel. SZmax showed the highest variability. Between tissues, L differed the most, ΔZ the least. Biological variation within bovine enamel is perhaps not only bigger than previously assumed, it may also overshadow any structural and chemical differences between tissues...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} mineral phase of spherulitic calcifications discovered in the pulpous mesenchyme of human primary molars by <b>microradiography.</b> Analytical scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction disclosed that well-crystallized brushite is the major compound of the spherulites. The mechanism leading to the crystallization of brushite is far from well understood. Histologically, on decalcified sections, inflammatory cells and capillaries can be seen trapped in the spherulites. In the light of these findings, {{it could be suggested}} that metabolic conditions may promote the crystallization of brushite in the pulp of primary molars.
