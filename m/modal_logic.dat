25|$|Since {{interior}} algebras are (normal) Boolean algebras with operators, {{they can}} be represented by fields of sets on appropriate relational structures. In particular, since they are modal algebras, {{they can be}} represented as fields of sets on a set with a single binary relation, called a modal frame. The modal frames corresponding to interior algebras are precisely the preordered sets. Preordered sets (also called S4-frames) provide the Kripke semantics of the <b>modal</b> <b>logic</b> S4, and the connection between interior algebras and preorders is deeply related to their connection with <b>modal</b> <b>logic.</b>|$|E

25|$|Modal logics include {{additional}} modal operators, such as {{an operator}} which states that a particular formula is not only true, but necessarily true.

40|$|Monotonic <b>modal</b> <b>logics</b> form a {{generalisation}} {{of normal}} <b>modal</b> <b>logics</b> {{in which the}} additivity of the diamond modality has been weakened to monotonicity: ✸p∨✸q → ✸(p∨q). This generalisation means that Kripke structures no longer form an adequate semantics. Instead monotonic <b>modal</b> <b>logics</b> are interpreted over monotonic neighbourhood structures, that is, neighbourhood structures where the neighbourhood function is closed under supersets. As specific examples of monotonic <b>modal</b> <b>logics</b> we mention Game Logic, Coalition Logic and the Alternating-Time Temporal Logic. This thesis presents results on monotonic <b>modal</b> <b>logics</b> in a general framework. The topics covered include model constructions and truth invariance, definability and correspondence theory, the canonical model construction, algebraic duality (for monotonic neighbourhood frames), coalgebraic semantics, Craig interpolation via superamalgamation, and simulations of monotonic <b>modal</b> <b>logics</b> by bimodal normal ones. The main contributions are: generalisations of the Sahlqvist correspondence and canonicity theorems, {{a detailed account of}} algebraic duality via canonical extensions, an analogue of the Goldblatt-Thomason theorem on definable frame classes...|$|R

25|$|Heyting algebras {{play the}} same role for intuitionistic logic that {{interior}} algebras play for the <b>modal</b> <b>logic</b> S4 and Boolean algebras play for propositional logic. The relation between Heyting algebras and interior algebras reflects the relationship between intuitionistic logic and S4, in which one can interpret theories of intuitionistic logic as S4 theories closed under necessity.|$|E

We also adapt the method of constructing suitable rule sets by saturation to the intuitionistic setting and provide a criterium for translating axioms for intuitionistic <b>modal</b> <b>logics</b> into sequent rules.

In this paper, we present a new approach for combining decision procedures for the word problem in the non-disjoint case that applies to equational theories induced by <b>modal</b> <b>logics,</b> but is not restricted to them. The known fusion decidability results for <b>modal</b> <b>logics</b> are instances of our approach.

25|$|David Kellogg Lewis, {{another student}} of Quine at Harvard, was ranked {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} philosophers of the 20th century in a poll conducted by Brian Leiter (open access poll). He is well known for his controversial advocacy of modal realism, the position which holds that there is an infinite number of concrete and causally isolated possible worlds, of which ours is one. These possible worlds arise in the field of <b>modal</b> <b>logic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Any monadic Boolean algebra can be {{considered}} to be an interior algebra where the interior operator is the universal quantifier and the closure operator is the existential quantifier. The monadic Boolean algebras are then precisely the variety of interior algebras satisfying the identity xIC = xI. In other words, they are precisely the interior algebras in which every open element is closed or equivalently, in which every closed element is open. Moreover, such interior algebras are precisely the semisimple interior algebras. They are also the interior algebras corresponding to the <b>modal</b> <b>logic</b> S5, and so have also been called S5 algebras.|$|E
40|$|Several {{justification}} logics {{have been}} created, {{starting with the}} logic LP, [1]. These {{can be thought of}} as explicit versions of <b>modal</b> <b>logics,</b> or of logics of knowledge or belief, in which the unanalyzed necessity (knowledge, belief) operator has been replaced with a family of explicit justification terms. We begin by sketching the basics of justification logics and their relations with <b>modal</b> <b>logics.</b> Then we move to new material. <b>Modal</b> <b>logics</b> come in various strengths. For their corresponding justification logics, differing strength is reflected in different vocabularies. What we show here is that for justification <b>logics</b> corresponding to <b>modal</b> <b>logics</b> extending T, various familiar extensions are actually conservative with respect to each other. Our method of proof is very simple, and general enough to handle several justification logics not directly corresponding to distinct <b>modal</b> <b>logics.</b> Our methods do not, however, allow us to prove comparable results for justification <b>logics</b> corresponding to <b>modal</b> <b>logics</b> that do not extend T. That is, we are able to handle explicit logics of knowledge, but not explicit logics of belief. This remains open...|$|R

25|$|In Europe, logic {{was first}} {{developed}} by Aristotle. Aristotelian logic became widely accepted {{in science and}} mathematics and remained in wide use in the West until the early 19thcentury. Aristotle's system of logic {{was responsible for the}} introduction of hypothetical syllogism, temporal <b>modal</b> <b>logic,</b> and inductive logic, as well as influential terms such as terms, predicables, syllogisms and propositions. In Europe during the later medieval period, major efforts were made to show that Aristotle's ideas were compatible with Christian faith. During the High Middle Ages, logic became a main focus of philosophers, who would engage in critical logical analyses of philosophical arguments, often using variations of the methodology of scholasticism. In 1323, William of Ockham's influential Summa Logicae was released. By the 18th century, the structured approach to arguments had degenerated and fallen out of favour, as depicted in Holberg's satirical play Erasmus Montanus.|$|E
25|$|In <b>modal</b> <b>logic</b> (which studies {{theories}} of possibility and necessity), he has argued {{in favour of}} the non-normal system S7, rather than more traditional systems such as S4 or S5. Unlike other systems, S7 allows logicians to choose between competing logics, each of which, if true, would be necessarily true, but none of which are necessarily the correct system of necessary truths. As Irvine puts it, “just as being physically possible means nothing more than being consistent with the laws of physics, being logically possible means nothing more than being consistent with the laws of logic. However, this leaves open the question of which logic and which consistency relation are to be adopted. S7 gives us the language to discuss the possible denial of necessary truths. S7 gives us the language to assert not only that some propositions really are necessary; it gives us the language also to note that their denials, although impossible, remain possibly possible.” In other words, there is a mechanism in which even sets of necessary truths {{can be compared to}} their alternatives.|$|E
500|$|On S5 {{systems in}} general, James Garson writes that [...] "the words ‘necessarily’ and ‘possibly’, have many {{different}} uses. So {{the acceptability of}} axioms for <b>modal</b> <b>logic</b> depends on which of these uses we have in mind." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a general semantic interpretation for propositional quantification in all multi-modal logics based on bisimulations (bisimulation quantification).

We investigate the properties of bisimulation quantifiers in general <b>modal</b> <b>logics,</b> particularly the expressivity and decidability, and seek to motivate the use of bisimulation quantified <b>modal</b> <b>logics.</b> This paper addresses two important questions: when are bisimulation quantified logics bisimulation invariant; and do bisimulation quantifiers always preserve decidability? We provide a sufficient condition for bisimulation invariance, and give two examples of decidable <b>modal</b> <b>logics</b> which are undecidable when augmented with bisimulation quantifiers.
