40|$|Abstract. If {{a friend}} called you 50 times last month, how <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> call him back? Does the answer change if we ask about SMS, or e-mails? We want to {{quantify}} reciprocity between individuals in weighted networks, {{and we want}} to discover whether it depends on their topological features (like degree, or number of common neighbors). Here we answer these questions, by studying the call- and SMS records of millions of mobile phone users from a large city, with more than 0. 5 billion phone calls and 60 million SMSs, exchanged over a period of six months. Our main contributions are: (1) We propose a novel distribution, the Triple Power Law (3 PL), that fits the reciprocity behavior of all 3 datasets we study, with a better fit than older competitors, (2) 3 PL is parsimonious; it has only three parameters and thus avoids over-fitting, (3) 3 PL can spot anomalies, and we report the most surprising ones, in our real networks, (4) We observe that the degree of reciprocity between users is correlated with their local topological features; reciprocity is higher among mutual users with larger local network overlap and greater degree similarity. ...|$|E

In his book Emotion and Reason: The Cognitive Neuroscience of Decision Making, Alain Berthoz aims to answer these questions and to shed light on the neural underpinnings of the highly familiar, yet so puzzling, phenomenon of making decisions. In 295 pages, he gives a comprehensive and entertaining overview of the neuroscience of choice behaviour. The focus of the later chapters is preluded by the first section of the book, entitled ‘Is decision making rational or irrational?’. In this section, Berthoz gives a brief account of the current controversy of whether decision making is just about computing gains, losses, and probabilities, or whether it is more than that. Decision making is of course more than that as emotional, social, and other factors frequently bias a person's judgment to deviate from the path of rationality, hence the book's title...|$|E

Video proceedings, which contain videos of all the conference talks, would be of a great value in these cases and in many others.

The key challenge is to create it in an efficient way and to provide the user with easy, intuitive and rapid access to the talks and the snippets of video that he is looking for. This paper describes an application that allows a nearly automatic, real time creation of video proceedings. All the talks are captured in video, and are automatically indexed by speech recognition and video analysis tools. The abstracts and speaker’s biography are extracted from the text proceedings and are converted to web pages. Free text search in speech and efficient multi-view video browsing are combined with a table of contents to compose fully searchable and browsable video proceedings.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the associations between alexithymia or emotional self-efficacy and compliance, quality of life (QoL) and renal function in renal transplant patients. METHODS: Forty-three patients were enrolled during a follow-up visit (> 3 months post-transplant) and were asked to complete three self-report questionnaires (TAS- 20, SF- 36, RESE) to answer the following items: "In the past four weeks, how <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> fail to take your prescribed dose?" and "How would you rate your adherence levels from 0 to 100 ?" (visual analogue scale). RESULTS: Alexithymia was positively correlated with non-compliance (r=. 314; p=. 04), and negatively with QoL dimensions. Analysis of variance confirmed that patients with high levels of alexithymia reported a negative perception of their QoL (mental health: F(1, 41) = 7, 6; p=. 008) and lower levels of compliance (F(1, 41) = 12, 5; p=. 001) compared with patients with low levels of alexithymia. The self-efficacy in the management of negative emotions was significantly correlated (r=-. 314; p=. 04) with creatinine levels and positively with the QoL (mental health: r=. 421; p=. 005). DISCUSSION: The inability to recognize and express emotions, as well as the ability to manage negative emotions, may influence compliance and QoL of renal transplant patients. Focused psychological support could be useful in these patients in order to increase their compliance and QoL...|$|E

Moreover, it is far from trivial to model how the topic of the whole paper and the contexts of the citation places should affect the selection and ranking of citations. To tackle the problem, we develop a context-aware approach. The core idea is to design a novel non-parametric probabilistic model which can measure the context-based relevance between a citation context and a document. Our approach can recommend citations for a context effectively. Moreover, it can recommend a set of citations for a paper with high quality. We implement a prototype system in CiteSeerX.

The Real Talk study is a randomized control trial that employs a brief motivational interview intervention in a clinical setting to reduce perpetration of teen dating violence (TDV) in Boston. Current participants of the Real Talk study who were eligible for follow up comprised the study sample (N= 127). Baseline characteristics on age, gender, race/ethnicity, high school completion, alcohol use, and marijuana use were analyzed using Pearson’s Chi Square, and the level of significance set to p < 0. 10.

This paper introduces the X. 500 system, and describes Brunel’s experience with setting up and running a directory service based on ISODE/Quipu. Software configuration is briefly discussed and the data-gathering process is described. Suggestions are given for merging data from several sources to form coherent directory entries. 1. The Need for a directory How often have you come back from a conference half-remembering somebody’s name and then wanted to contact them? How <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> refer to your organisations internal phone book each week?

Similar {{convergence}} rate questions for finite Markov chains are central to solving applied problems in diverse fields including physics, computer science and biology. This thesis investigates two general techniques for estimating mixing times for finite Markov chains: modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and Faber-Krahn inequalities; and analyzes the convergence behavior of a specific family of random walks: the top to bottom shuffles. Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities are a well-studied technique for estimating convergence rates for Markov chains. In contrast to continuous state spaces, there are several distinct modified log Sobolev inequalities in the discrete setting. Here we derive modified log Sobolev inequalities for several models of random walk, including the random transposition shuffle. These results lead to tight mixing time estimates, and additionally, yield concentration inequalities. Faber-Krahn inequalities {{have been used to}} estimate the rate of decay of the heat kernel on complete, non-compact manifolds and infinite graphs. We develop this technique in the setting of finite Markov chains, proving upper and lower mixing time bounds via the spectral profile. This approach lets us recover previous conductance-based bounds of mixing time, and in general leads to sharper estimates of convergence rates. We apply this method to several models, including groups with moderate growth, the fractal-like Viscek graphs, and the torus, and obtain tight bounds on the corresponding mixing times. A deck of n cards is shuffled by repeatedly moving the top card to one of the bottom k positions of the deck uniformly at random. We give upper and lower bounds on the total variation mixing time for this shuffle as k ranges from a constant to n. We also consider a symmetric variant of this walk which at each step either inserts the top card randomly into the bottom k positions or moves a random card from the bottom k positions to the top. For this reversible shuffle we derive L^ 2 mixing time bounds. National Science Foundation grant DMS- 030619...|$|R

How many days per week <b>do</b> <b>you</b> usually have something to eat for breakfast? 3. In the last 12 months, were there any times that you ran out of food and couldn’t afford to buy more? 4. What type of milk <b>do</b> <b>you</b> usually consume? 5. How many serves of vegetables <b>do</b> <b>you</b> usually eat each day?

(a serve = 1 medium piece or 2 small pieces of fruit or 1 cup of diced pieces) These comparisons were made {{for males and females}} overall and for population sub-groups of interest including: age, socio-economic disadvantage, region of residence, country of birth, and BMI category. Several limitations to this evaluation {{of the short}} questions, as discussed in the report, need to be kept in mind including: · The method for comparison available (24 -hour recall) was not ideal (gold standard); as it measures yesterday’s intake. This limitation was overcome by examining only mean differences between groups of respondents, since mean intake for a group can provide a reasonable approximation for ‘usual’ intake. · The need to define and identify, post-hoc, from the 24 -hour recall the number of eating occasions, and occasions identified by the respondents as breakfast. · Predetermined response categories for some of the questions effectively limited the number of categories available for evaluation. · Other foods and nutrients, not selected for this evaluation, may have an indirect relationship with the question, and might have shown stronger and more consistent responses. · The number of responses in some categories of the short questions eg for food security may have been too small to detect significant differences between population sub-groups. · No information was available to examine the validity of these questions for detecting differences over time (establishing trends) in food habits and indicators of selected nutrient intakes. By contrast, the strength of this evaluation was its very large sample size, (atypical of most validation studies of dietary assessment) and thus, the opportunity to investigate question performance in a range of broad population sub-groups compared with a well-conducted, quantified survey of intakes. The results of the evaluation are summarised below for each of the questions and specific recommendations for future testing, modifications and use provided for each question.

For though by the act of justification, we are for ever secured from a state of condemnation; yet as we are children, we need {{forgiveness}} daily, and have need to pray, 'Our Father, forgive us our trespasses.' Now, {{that we may have}} daily forgiveness for our daily sins and trespasses, mercy and goodness must follow us; or as Moses has it, 'And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord! let my Lord, I pray thee, go amongst us, for it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance' (Exo 34:9). Join to this that prayer of his, which you find in Numbers: 'Now I beseech thee let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, The Lord is long-suffering and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation. Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now,' or hitherto (Num 14:17-19). How <b>many</b> <b>times,</b> think <b>you,</b> <b>did</b> Israel stand in need of pardon, from Egypt, until they came to Canaan? Even so <b>many</b> <b>times</b> wilt thou need pardon from the day of thy conversion to the day of death; to the which God will follow Israel, that he may dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.|$|R
