He then was involved in several inconsequential conspiracies, in order to implant a monarchist regime in Parliament, defending most of the ideas anti-democratic Republicans would adopt. His appeals were not given any debate. Rapidly, the regime fell on October 5, and the First Portuguese Republic was proclaimed.|$|E
25|$|City's ship {{landed in}} Rio de Janeiro on 17 July. On 18 July, City beat Rio English 3-0 (Hunter, Holt, Lovett). The game was very one-sided, with City keeper Reg Loram (Pym missed the {{remainder}} of the tour through injury), the only amateur in the team, not being tested until late in the game. On 19 July, it was announced in the news that Paulista players would travel to Rio. Some had had difficulty getting time off work, so APEA's treasurer travelled to Rio to change the dates of the final two games in order for three Brasileiros from São Paulo -Rubens Salles (Paulistano), Xavier (Ipiranga) and Arthur Friedenreich (Ipiranga)- to play in a league match and catch the overnight train. Later that day, City beat Rio de Janeiro 5-3 (Charlie Pratt 2, Lagan, Goodwin, Hunter). Harry Welfare had put the hosts 3-1 ahead, at which point City became more physical, something which was criticised by the Correio da <b>Manhã.</b> On 21 July, City lost 2-0 to Brasileiros (a selection of Brazilian players from Rio and São Paulo). During the game, Lagan and Fort walked off the pitch, but were convinced to return to the field and finish the game. This is considered to be the Brazilian national team's first ever game. All three games were played at Fluminense's Estádio das Laranjeiras. Harry Robinson played {{in the first two games}} and refereed the last one, making sixteen saves in the first game for Rio English.|$|E

[...] In 2009 Portugal released a further 2,000 pages. Days after the case closed, excerpts from Kate McCann's diary, which had been taken by the Polícia Judiciária in August 2007, were published in translation by a Portuguese tabloid, Correio da <b>Manhã,</b> despite a Portuguese judge's ruling in June 2008 that the seizure had been a privacy violation and that any copies must be destroyed. On 14 September 2008 a News International tabloid, News of the World, published the extracts, again without permission and now translated poorly back into English.|$|E
500|$|Kate McCann's {{appearance}} and demeanour were widely discussed, {{with much of}} the commentary coming from other women, including Booker Prize-winner Anne Enright in the London Review of Books. Kate was deemed cold and controlled, too attractive, too thin, too well-dressed, too intense. She had apparently been advised by abduction experts not to cry on camera because the kidnapper might enjoy her distress, and this led to more criticism: the Portuguese tabloid Correio da <b>Manhã</b> cited sources complaining that she had not [...] "shed a single tear". Journalism professor Nicola Goc argued that Kate had joined a long list of mothers deemed killers because of unacceptable maternal behaviour. Commentators compared her experience to that of Lindy Chamberlain, convicted of murder after her baby was killed by a dingo. Like Kate, she was suspected, in part, because she did not weep in public. There was even a similar (false) story about supposedly relevant Bible passages the women were said to have highlighted. Chamberlain asked: [...] "How can you apologise to me and do this again to someone else?" ...|$|E

500|$|On 4 May, Benfica played Alverca at home, {{where they}} lost 0–2, {{and in the}} writing of João Querido <b>Manhã</b> for Record, the fans [...] "burst into protests at the end, after they lost {{patience}} with the errors, passivity and lack of talent of the whole team.". On 13 May, Benfica went to Adelino Ribeiro Novo to face Gil Vicente. The game ended in a 3–0 defeat – their tenth loss within the league, matching their previous record in the 1996–97 season. As a result, the club was overtaken by Belenenses in the league table. A week later, Benfica played host to Salgueiros in Da Luz. A final score of 1–1 saved Benfica from a record fourth straight loss, and gave the Porto-based side their first point all season against a top 7 team. Benfica played the last game of the season against Desportivo de Aves on the road. At one point in the game, the team was losing three-nil, but managed to equalize and finish with a four-all draw. Toni stated that [...] "Everyone did not do their best to avoid that a historic club slipped into a position that is not accustomed." [...] Benfica finished in a record-breaking sixth place after the 34-game season with a tally of 15 wins, 9 draws and 10 losses that, together, summed up to 54 points. They were ninth-lowest league-wide in goals conceded – 44 in all. On the plus side, they were fifth best in the league at goal-scoring, with a total of 54 goals. Van Hooijdonk was the second most productive player in the Primeira Liga with 19 goals.|$|E

2500|$|Paulo Portas has defended {{himself by}} {{claiming}} {{the deal was}} agreed before he became Minister {{and that he had}} no contact with the two intermediaries found guilty of corruption in Germany. In 2012, Portugal's Attorney-General Office (Ministério Público) considered Paulo Portas a suspect in its ongoing investigation into the deal and found that the government files on the submarines' purchase from when Portas was Minister of Defence [...] "had disappeared." [...] In a separate investigation in 2011, the Attorney General Office charged 10 suspects with fraud in connection with the contract's counterparts clause but Portas was not among them. In 2014, all 10 suspects were declared not guilty by the court [...] and it was revealed that Portas had participated in the judicial proceedings as a witness. In April 2014, the Portuguese daily newspaper Correio da <b>Manhã</b> claimed the price of the submarines had been further aggravated by as much 220 million euros (fees and interest) by costly financial swap contracts agreed to by Paulo Portas. In a written repply to the editor, Paulo Portas defended the rationale and conformity of the financial arrangements underlying the submarines' purchase. In 2014 the Portuguese Parliament set up an inquiry commission to the submarines deals that found no evidence of wrongdoing; but the opposition parties denounced the inquiry proceedings and conclusions as manipulated by the ruling PSD/CDS-PP government coalition that was also in power when the submarines were purchased in 2004.|$|E

However, many specimens from across other parts of Asia have also been assigned to Forstercooperia. The only non-holotypic specimen of F. totadentata is that of F. shiwopuensis, which comes from the Lunan Formation of China. F. confluens, now including the Asian material of F. grandis, is known from Shara Murun Formation, Ulan Shireh Formation and Houldjin Formation, {{as well as the}} Irdin <b>Manha</b> Formation.
