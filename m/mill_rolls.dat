5000|$|At the Lyocell <b>mill,</b> <b>rolls</b> of pulp {{are broken}} into one-inch squares and {{dissolved}} in N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, giving a solution called [...] "dope." [...] The filtered cellulose solution is then pumped through spinnerets, devices {{used with a}} variety of manmade fibres. The spinneret is pierced with small holes rather like a showerhead; when the solution is forced through it, continuous strands of filament come out. The fibres are drawn in air to align the cellulose molecules, giving the Lyocell fibres its characteristic high strength. The fibres are then immersed into a water bath, where desolvation of the cellulose sets the fibre strands; the bath contains some dilute amine oxide in a steady state concentration. Then the fibers are washed with de-mineralised water. The Lyocell fibre next passes to a drying area, where the water is evaporated from it.|$|E
50|$|Forage {{harvesters}} can be implements {{attached to}} a tractor, or they can be self-propelled units. In either configuration, they have either a drum (cutterhead) or a flywheel {{with a number of}} knives fixed to it that chops and blows the silage out a chute of the harvester into a wagon that is either connected to the harvester or to another vehicle driving alongside. Most larger machines also have paddle accelerators to increase material speed and improve unloading characteristics. Once a wagon is filled up, the wagon can be detached and taken back to a silo for unloading, and another wagon can be attached. Because corn and grass require different types of cutting equipment, there are different heads for each type of silage, and these heads can be connected and disconnected from the harvester. Grass silage is usually cut prior to harvesting to allow it to wilt, before being harvested from swathes with a collection header (windrow pickup). Maize and whole crop silage are cut directly by the header, using reciprocating knives, disc mowers or large saw-like blades. Kernel processors (KP), modules consisting of two <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> with teeth pressed together by powerful springs, are frequently used when harvesting cereal crops like corn and sorghum to crack the kernels of these plant heads. Kernel processors are installed between the cutterhead and accelerator. In most forage harvesters, the KP can be quickly removed and replaced with a grass chute for chopping non-cereal crops.|$|E

This defect is usually intermittent over time, {{and in some}} extent, unrelated with the chemical composition and the process parameters used. To study this phenomenon, a metallographic analysis {{has been carried out}} on two real 5. 5 -ton chilled iron <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> made of the same chemical composition, manufactured with quite similar process parameters, but giving two very different results in practice: one of the two <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> exhibited a macroscopic crack. Because of the different metallurgical structures observed, especially regarding graphite content, a three-dimensional (3 D) numerical analysis has been adopted to predict the thermal-mechanical behavior of the casting during the solidification and cooling stages. Special attention has been dedicated to the influence of the graphite expansion on mechanical stresses occurring in the casting skin. Numerical results point out that graphite expansion notably affects the evolution of stress-strain fields within the casting to an extent that it could lead to the formation of macroscopic cracks {{in the early stages of}} the casting solidification. Furthermore, the numerical analysis highlights that the thermal deformation of the permanent mold contributes to increase the risk of cracks to occu...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{role of the}} {{chemical}} composition of cast irons for <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> in tendencies of diffusionless transformations in the matrix was determined. The investigations of {{the chemical}} composition, microstructure and hardness influence on tribological properties of mottled cast iron {{is presented in the}} paper. Design/methodology/approach: The research stand is generally used in the tribological tests, and the counter sample of the material also common in such tests. Bearing steel 100 Cr 6, of a hardness of 57 HRC, was applied as a counter sample. The tribological tests were performed at a load of 100 N. Samples for tests were taken from seven <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> made by various producers. Mottled cast irons had a different chemical composition. Findings: The role of individual alloying elements in a tendency of the diffusionless transformations in the matrix, hardness, wear resistance and friction coefficient of mottled cast irons used for the <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> was estimated. The hardness increase rather increases the wear resistance of the investigated cast irons. Research limitations/implications: The possibility of designing the chemical composition of mottled cast iron {{in such a way as}} to obtain the low tribological wear at retaining, at the same time, the high friction coefficient was found. The relationship between the hardness resulting from the chemical composition and the wear resistance of the investigated mottled cast irons was presented. Practical implications: The obtained results can be utilised in designing the chemical compositions of the cast iron <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> and to obtain materials characterised by the high wear resistance at the assumed friction coefficient. Originality/value: Surprisingly, the increased chromium content seems to decrease the wear resistance of the investigated cast irons and the wear resistance of the investigated mottled cast irons is rather decreasing when the coefficient of friction increases...|$|E

The model requires a notably large set of material parameters. For different phases and temperatures, Young modulus, yield limit and tangent plastic modulus are determined through compression tests. Rupture stresses and strains are obtained by tensile tests. Thermo-physical parameters are measured by such experimental methods as dilatometry, DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) and Laser Flash methods. Such parameters as the transformation plasticity coeﬁicients for the ferrite, pearlite and martensite phases are identiﬁed through an inverse method.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the role of the {{microstructure}} in the tribological wear processes occurring in a cast iron mill roll. For this purpose, a piece of a broken roll, made in Italy, was collected. Its microstructure consisted of modular graphite, transformed ledeburite and a matrix composed of bainite and martensite. Metallographic investigations were performed on the roll working surface in conjunction with metallographic tests effected within its surface layer. There was established the relation between the microstructure of the roll and the process of its tribological wear. The following was ascertained: micro-shrinkages or graphite precipitations nearby the working area cause cracks between those places and the working area; in the surface layer, cracks occur usually in the zone of ledeburitic cementite. At places of considerable precipitations of ledeburitic cementite, the tribological wear intensity of the roll is lower. A banded layout of precipitations of ledeburitic cementite facilitates a selective spalling of some parts of the roll material. The results of this study allow broadening the data base related to the effect of the microstructure on tribological wear of <b>mill</b> <b>rolls,</b> which in future will permit one to design their proper microstructure of cast iron <b>mill</b> <b>rolls...</b>|$|E
