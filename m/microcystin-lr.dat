50|$|Acute <b>microcystin-LR</b> {{intoxication}} {{may result}} in long-term injury, while chronic low-level exposure may cause adverse health effects. From animal studies, it is proven {{that there will be}} chronic liver injury from oral exposure to <b>microcystin-LR.</b> It might even be carcinogenic. Cancers have been found during animal studies. <b>Microcystin-LR</b> itself does not cause cancer, but it may stimulate the growth of cancer cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microcystin-LR</b> {{inhibits}} protein phosphatase type 1 {{and type}} 2A (PP1 and PP2A) {{activities in the}} cytoplasm of liver cells. This leads {{to an increase in}} phosphorylation of proteins in liver cells. The interaction of <b>microcystin-LR</b> to the phosphatases includes the formation of a covalent bond between a methylene group of <b>microcystin-LR</b> and a cystine residue at the catalytic subunit of the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family of serine/threonine-specific phosphatases, like PP1 and PP2A. When <b>microcystin-LR</b> binds directly to the catalytic center of the PPP enzymes, they block the access of the substrate to the active site completely and inhibition of the enzyme takes place. In this way the protein phosphatase is inhibited and more phosphorylated proteins in the liver cells are left, which is responsible for the hepatotoxicity of <b>microcystin-LR.</b>|$|E
50|$|The IARC {{committee}} {{concluded that}} <b>microcystin-LR</b> is possibly carcinogenic to humans. So, <b>microcystin-LR</b> {{itself is not}} a carcinogen, but it stimulates tumor growth. Mice treated with the carcinogenic compound dimethylbenzathracene showed an increased number and weight of skin tumors.|$|E

50|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of <b>microcystin-LR</b> in Microcystis aeruginosa {{begins with}} the coupling of phenylacetate to the mcyG enzyme. In a series of reactions, catalysed by different enzyme modules as well as different enzymes, <b>microcystin-LR</b> is formed. The entire biosynthesis pathway of <b>microcystin-LR</b> in Microcystis aeruginosa is illustrated in the figure.The first steps of the synthesis involve the insertion of several carbon- and oxygen atoms between the acetyl- and phenylgroup. This part of the synthesis is catalyzed by enzyme domains that possess β-ketoacylsynthase, acyltransferase, C-methyltransferase and ketoacyl reductase activity. At {{the end of this}} stage, that is, after the first condensation of glutamate, the amino acid Adda is formed.The second part of the synthesis involves the condensation of the amino acids of which the microcystin is composed. Thus, in the case of <b>microcystin-LR</b> the consecutive condensation of the amino acids glutamic acid, methyldehydroalanine, alanine, leucine, methylaspartic acid and arginine leads to the coupled product. A nucleophilic attack of the nitrogen in the Adda residue results in the release of the cyclic <b>microcystin-LR.</b>|$|E
50|$|Data {{about the}} {{metabolism}} of <b>microcystin-LR</b> in humans is very scarce. Data about metabolism and {{disposition of the}} toxin in mice and rats is more widely available. In these animals <b>microcystin-LR</b> is rapidly concentrated in the liver. Intoxication of mice with <b>microcystin-LR</b> led to {{a decrease in the}} levels of cytochrome P450 and cytochrome b5 and an increase in cytochrome P420, to which CYP450 is converted. Together with the fact that mice with an induced higher concentration CYP450 are less affected by the toxin, this suggest that CYP450 {{plays an important role in}} the detoxification of the compound.|$|E

50|$|The {{different}} microcystins are all synthesized by {{the same}} enzymes as <b>microcystin-LR.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Microcystin-LR</b> {{is mostly}} {{concentrated}} in the liver. Other tissues get exposed at much lower levels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microcystin-LR</b> (MC-LR) is a toxin {{produced}} by cyanobacteria. It {{is the most}} toxic of the microcystins.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} cyanotoxins, microcystins were {{named after the}} first {{organism}} discovered to produce them, Microcystis aeruginosa. However it was later found other cyanobacterial genera also produced them. There are about 60 known variants of microcystin, and several of these can be produced during a bloom. The most reported variant is <b>microcystin-LR,</b> possibly because the earliest commercially available chemical standard analysis was for <b>microcystin-LR.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mircocystin-LR is toxic for all animals, {{including}} the animals we consume as humans. Fishes and birds {{are also at}} risk for <b>microcystin-LR</b> poisoning.|$|E
5000|$|The WHO states <b>microcystin-LR</b> has no {{mutagenic}} effect. However, {{the induction}} of DNA strand-breaks in lymphocytes {{has been observed}} in mice after single oral administration. The effect is time- and dose-dependent. There is {{no change in the}} expression of selected genes involved in the cellular response to DNA damage after a 4-hour exposure. After 24 hours, the DNA damage-responsive genes were upregulated, which indicates that <b>microcystin-LR</b> is an indirect genotoxic agent. [...] In China, the highest incidence of liver cancer occurs in areas with abundant cyanobacteria in the surface waters. Tumor development is associated with low-concentration exposure {{over a long period of}} time.|$|E
50|$|The {{active site}} of {{catalytic}} PPP enzymes represents three surface grooves: the hydrophobic groove, the acidic groove and the C-terminal groove, which are Y-shaped with the active site at the bifurcation point. The Adda side-chain of <b>microcystin-LR</b> is accommodated to the hydrophobic groove, the carboxylic D-Glu site makes hydrogen bonds to metal-bound water molecules and the carboxyl {{group of the}} Masp site makes hydrogen bonds to conserved arginine and tyrosine residues in the PPP enzyme. Finally the methylene group at the Mdha site of <b>microcystin-LR</b> binds covalently to a S-atom of a cysteine residue, and the leucine residue packs closely to another conserved tyrosine residue.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microcystin-LR</b> is toxic {{for both}} humans and animals. There are {{epidemiological}} results from {{studies that have}} shown symptoms of poisoning attributed {{to the presence of}} cyanotoxins in drinking water. The effects are divided in short-term and long-term effects.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Microcystin-LR</b> had {{effects on}} all animals, {{not only the}} {{domestic}} animals from swimming in a river of drinking water with cyanobacteria blooms. Symptoms in domestic animal poisoning include diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, recumbency and are fatal in most cases ...|$|E
50|$|After nasal {{administration}} of <b>microcystin-LR,</b> the epithelium of nasal mucosa {{of both the}} olfactory and respiratory zones were suffering from necrosis. Even liver lesions were noticed after oral administration. The LD50 for nasal administration {{is equal to the}} intraperitoneal administration.|$|E
50|$|Eighty microcystins {{have been}} {{identified}} to date, representing differences in the two variable residues and some modifications in the other amino acids. These modifications include demethylation of Masp and Mdha and methylesterification of D-Glu. Different microcystins have different toxicity profiles, with <b>microcystin-LR</b> {{found to be the}} most toxic.|$|E
50|$|In vitro {{studies showed}} that <b>microcystin-LR</b> is a potent {{inhibitor}} of protein phosphatase 1 (PP-1) and PP2A, but {{has no effect on}} protein kinase C or cyclic AMP-dependent kinase. Mutagenicity does not appear to occur for purified toxins derived from Microcystis, although the toxins were clastogenic for human lymphocytes.|$|E
50|$|In phase 2 of the {{biotransformation}} {{the compound}} is conjugated with several different endogenous substances. <b>Microcystin-LR</b> {{is known to}} be excreted as glutathione conjugate, cysteine conjugate and an oxidized ADDA diene conjugate. The glutathione and cysteine conjugate with the Mda-moiety. The oxidized ADDA is conjugated at the conjugated bond.|$|E
50|$|The Chinese general Zhu-Ge Liang was {{the first}} to observe {{cyanobacteria}} poisoning about 1000 years ago. He reported the death of troops who drank green coloured water from a river in southern China. The first published report of an incidence of cyanobacteria poisoning dates from the poisoning of an Australian lake in 1878. Also, in China and Brasil, people died after drinking water from a lake. All these incidents have been attributed to cyanobacteria and the toxic compound <b>microcystin-LR.</b> That is the reason why the World Health Organisation (WHO) issued a guideline for microcystins in drinking water. The WHO guideline for microcystins in drinking water, based on <b>microcystin-LR,</b> is 1 μg/L. With the high levels of Eutrophication in South Africa, typical exposures can be as high as 10 μg/L.|$|E
50|$|There are few {{short-term}} effects {{caused by}} exposure to <b>microcystin-LR.</b> Microcystins are primarily hepatotoxic compounds; therefore, noticeable toxic effects are not immediate. Most of the toxicity {{studies have been done}} with mice that received intra-peritoneal injections. The most common effect is liver damage, Two of the most commonly seen symptoms are gastroenteritis and cholestatic liver disease.|$|E
50|$|Microcystins are cyclic heptapeptides. The seven {{amino acids}} that are {{involved}} in the structure of a microcystin include a unique β-amino acid (ADDA). It contains alanine (D-ala), D-β-methyl-isoaspartate (D-β-Me-isoAsp), and glutamic acid (D-glu). Furthermore, microcystins contain two variable residues, which make the differentiation between variants of microcystins. These two variable elements are always standard L-amino acids. In <b>microcystin-LR</b> these are leucine and arginine.|$|E
50|$|Microcystins — or cyanoginosins — are a {{class of}} toxins {{produced}} by certain freshwater cyanobacteria; primarily Microcystis aeruginosa but also other Microcystis, as well {{as members of the}} Planktothrix, Anabaena, Oscillatoria and Nostoc genera. Over 50 different microcystins have been discovered so far, of which <b>microcystin-LR</b> is the most common. Chemically they are cyclic heptapeptides produced through nonribosomal peptide synthases.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Microcystin-LR</b> is {{the most}} toxic form of over 80 known toxic variants, and {{is also the most}} studied by chemists, pharmacologists, biologists, and ecologists. Microcystin-containing 'blooms' are a problem worldwide, {{including}} China, Brazil, Australia, South Africa, [...] the United States and much of Europe. Hartebeespoort Dam in South Africa {{is one of the most}} contaminated sites in Africa, and possibly in the entire world.|$|E
50|$|S. aeruginosa is a herbivorous deposit feeder. It consumes mainly epiphytic algae, but its diet also {{includes}} detritus, bacteria, aquatic plants, sand grains, diatoms, green algae, and cyanobacteria such as Microcystis. Its consumption of cyanobacteria during algal blooms {{may result in}} bioaccumulation of toxic microcystins (<b>microcystin-LR,</b> microcystin-RR) from Microcystis in the gonads, the hepatopancreas and the digestive tract. Adult snails feeding ad libitum under ideal laboratory conditions eat 16.0 mg of fish food daily.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microcystin-LR</b> {{is rapidly}} {{excreted}} {{from the blood}} plasma. Plasma half-lifes for the α- and β-stages, corresponding to distribution and elimination, are respectively 0.8 and 6.9 minutes. The total clearance of the compound from the plasma is about 0.9 mL/min. The excretion of the compound takes primarily place via the feces and urine. After 6 days approximately 24% of the intake is excreted from the body, of which about 9% is excreted via the feces and 14.5% via the urine.|$|E
50|$|Special {{designed}} SWNHs nanocomposites have versatile biosensing applications. One {{example is}} the sandwich nanohybrid of SWNHs-TiO2-porphyrin, prepared via the dentate binding of TiO2 nanoparticles to carboxylate groups. The nanohybrid showed an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of chloramphenicol in neutral media, leading to a highly sensitive and stable amperometric biosensor for chloramphenicol. Another {{example is the}} specific peptide functionalized SWNHs nanocomposite, which was used to fabricate an immunosensor towards <b>microcystin-LR.</b> Compared to other nanomaterials, SWNHs increased the sensitivity of immunoassay.|$|E
50|$|Microcystins {{are small}} nonribosomal peptides. In Microcystis aeruginosa <b>microcystin-LR</b> is {{synthesized}} by proteins that encoded by a 55 kb microcystin-gene cluster (mcy) that contains 6 large (over 3 kb) genes that encode proteins with polyketide synthase activity, nonribosomal peptide synthase activity (mcyA-E and G) and 4 smaller genes (mcyF and H-J). These large proteins {{are made up}} of different protein domains, coined 'modules', that each have their own specific enzymatic function.Although the enzyme systems involved in the biosynthesis of microcystins is not identical among all cyanobacteria, there are large similarities and most of the essential enzymes are conserved.|$|E
50|$|Some {{studies on}} {{probiotic}} properties of indigenous strains isolated from dadih fermented milk demonstrated to exhibit antimutagenic, acid, and bile tolerance {{as well as}} antipathogenic properties. Natural wild strains isolated from dadih show inhibitory, competitive and displacing properties against pathogens, and they are promising candidates for future probiotics. Viable cells of Lactobacillus plantarum strains from dadih as well as active metabolism play important roles in removing <b>microcystin-LR,</b> cyanobacterial toxin, and natural wild strain of Lactobacillus plantarum from dadih has the highest removal abilities {{as compared to the}} other commercial probiotic strains. This finding offers new and economical tools for decontaminating microcystin containing water.|$|E
5000|$|There are no verifiable {{reports of}} human deaths {{known to have}} been {{specifically}} caused by <b>microcystin-LR,</b> although there are reports of health effects after exposure and there have been deaths attributed to microcystins in general. One of the most outstanding reports was an outbreak in Caruaru, Brazil, in 1996. 116 patients experienced multiple effects: visual disturbance, nausea, vomiting and muscle weakness. One hundred developed acute liver failure and 52 suffered from symptoms of what is now called [...] "Caruaru Syndrome." [...] The syndrome was caused by dialysis therapy with water that had not been properly treated.|$|E
50|$|When microcystins are {{injected}} intraveneously or intraperitoneally, they localize in the liver. This {{appears to}} be the result of uptake by hepatocytes. The WHO repport states that microcystins are lethal to mice when they are exposed intraperitoneally to 25 to 150 µg/kg body weight. Perhaps due to poor absorption after exposure, orally administered microscytins are less toxic, as a lethal dose in mice is about 5 to 10 µg/kg body weight. Hepatotoxicity in the form of hepatic necrosis occurs within 60 minutes after an intraveneous dose.Blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa did not cause increased tumor rates in groups of mice treated for up to one year. It is shown that mice given 20 µg/kg body weight 4 times a week during a period of 28 weeks developed neoplasms of the liver. There results are, however, ambiguous. By the oral route, <b>microcystin-LR</b> displays acute toxicity in rodents. It is apparent that a significant amount of the oral dose passes the intestinal barrier.|$|E
40|$|Occurrence of {{cyanobacteria}} {{and their}} potent toxins has imposed {{a risk to}} human health and raised concerns in drinking water treatment. In this study, the applicability of electrochemical oxidation on <b>microcystin-LR</b> produced by cyanobacteria was examined using Ti/RuO 2 as anodes. The experiments focused on the variation and elimination of extracellular and intracellular <b>microcystin-LR</b> during the cyanobacterial inactivation by electro-oxidation. The effects of applied current density, cell density, as well as electrolyte type on toxin degradation have been studied. The complete elimination of extracellular and intracellular <b>microcystin-LR</b> was achieved and 100 % removal for total <b>microcystin-LR</b> was obtained at current density 5 mA/cm(2). The results showed that when the cell densities decreased or the applied current densities increased, the efficiency of total <b>microcystin-LR</b> removal could be increased. More than 98 % removal for total <b>microcystin-LR</b> was also achieved even if the cyanobacteria were inoculated in lake water or drinking water without adding any chemicals. It can be concluded that electro-oxidation of <b>microcystin-LR</b> is quite an efficient method, and {{can be applied to}} remove <b>microcystin-LR</b> from waters during the cyanobacterial inactivation...|$|E

40|$|In the Chowan River, North Carolina, the {{frequency}} of Microcystis aeruginosa blooms has increased over recent years with an average 1. 9 °C rise in June water temperatures since 1975. Zooplankton are an important trophic link for toxins {{to move up the}} food web. Bosmina longirostris, a dominant zooplankton in the Chowan River, consumes toxic M. aeruginosa cells. This study aimed to understand how <b>microcystin-LR,</b> produced from M. aeruginosa blooms, affects B. longirostris mortality under increasing temperatures. B. longirostris were resistant to <b>microcystin-LR,</b> demonstrating an LC 50 of 26. 3 [mu]g/L. Therefore B. longirostris can survive typical bloom <b>microcystin-LR</b> concentrations ranging less than 0. 1 [micro]g/L to 2. 0 [mu]g/L. As temperatures were increased from 25 °C to 35 °C, <b>microcystin-LR</b> mortality increased approximately 18 % from 25 - 27 °C; demonstrating that <b>microcystin-LR</b> was more toxic with increasing temperatures. Above 27 °C, mortality also increased, but this was due to the effect of temperature rather than increased toxicity of <b>microcystin-LR.</b> This signifies that during spring, when temperatures are below 27 °C and B. longirostris are most abundant, <b>microcystin-LR</b> may be most toxic and may have the greatest influence on the Chowan River food web.
