5|$|Old Kazran is soon {{visited by}} {{holographic}} {{images of the}} ship's crew in the present. After observing the effects of Abigail's singing, the crew is singing Christmas carols, the sound frequencies of which are helping to stabilise the ship but cannot prevent it from crashing. Amy appears to Kazran and implores his help, but he waves away the holograms. The Doctor appears, and Kazran surmises that he is there to show Kazran his future, {{but he could not}} care less if he dies old and alone; he reveals that Abigail had an incurable disease on entering cryostorage and will only have one more day to live. As he cannot decide which day that should be, Kazran chastises the Doctor for believing he could change his mind. Unbeknownst to Kazran, the Doctor has brought young Kazran with him; the realisation of how <b>much</b> <b>his</b> bitter future self now resembles his feared father causes a change of heart in Kazran (making his own memory of his future self the show's version of the ghost of Christmas yet to come), and he quickly agrees to release the controls to save the ship.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{moved to}} Mysore {{to live with}} his family when his father was {{transferred}} to the Maharajah's College High School. The well-stocked library at the school, as well as his father's own, fed his reading habit, and he started writing as well. After completing high school, Narayan failed the university entrance examination and spent a year at home reading and writing; he subsequently passed the examination in 1926 and joined Maharaja College of Mysore. It took Narayan four years to obtain his bachelor's degree, a year longer than usual. After being persuaded by a friend that taking a master's degree (M.A.) would kill his interest in literature, he briefly held a job as a school teacher; however, he quit in protest when the headmaster of the school asked him to substitute for the physical training master. The experience made Narayan realise that the only career for him was in writing, and he decided to stay at home and write novels. His first published work was a book review of Development of Maritime Laws of 17th-Century England. Subsequently, he started writing the occasional local interest story for English newspapers and magazines. Although the writing did not pay <b>much</b> (<b>his</b> income for the first year was nine rupees and twelve annas), he had a regular life and few needs, and his family and friends respected and supported his unorthodox choice of career. In 1930, Narayan wrote his first novel, Swami and Friends, an effort ridiculed by his uncle and rejected by a string of publishers. With this book, Narayan created Malgudi, a town that creatively reproduced the social sphere of the country; while it ignored the limits imposed by colonial rule, it also grew with the various socio-political changes of British and post-independence India.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{he had an}} {{independent}} streak: he was very <b>much</b> <b>his</b> own man. This appears most clearly in his ideas about music.|$|E
6000|$|My uncle {{laid him}} down, and looked one moment at his {{beautiful}} face. It was too <b>much</b> for <b>his</b> principles, too <b>much</b> for <b>his</b> consistency, and [...] "he lifted up {{his voice and}} wept." ...|$|R

25|$|Jefferson's {{home was}} built {{to serve as a}} {{plantation}} house, which ultimately took on the architectural form of a villa.

25|$|Parvati tames Shiva {{with her}} presence. When Shiva does his violent, {{destructive}} Tandava dance, Parvati {{is described as}} calming him or complementing his violence by slow, creative steps of her own Lasya dance. In many myths, Parvati is not as <b>much</b> <b>his</b> complement as his rival, tricking, seducing, or luring him away from his ascetic practices.|$|E

50|$|Edward Steinkopff (c1838-28 February 1906), was a German {{entrepreneur}} and art collector {{who lived}} <b>much</b> of <b>his</b> life in Britain.

50|$|He {{was born}} on a small sandy island about 20 miles from Phnom Penh.

25|$|If a {{manufacturer}} {{can not make}} money in competition with other concerns when using the same methods of figuring costs, he can only conclude that his goods or his marketing, or both of them, are costing him too <b>much.</b> <b>His</b> next step, naturally, is to analyse closely the methods and conditions under which he is manufacturing and marketing his product, until he finds and corrects the inefficiencies which are handicapping him so seriously...|$|E
25|$|He {{retired in}} September 1923, living in Portugal and then England. He devoted <b>much</b> <b>his</b> {{time to the}} welfare and remembrance of Great War soldiers. He worked on his memoirs, which were {{published}} in 1925. As French was still alive {{at the time of}} writing, he still felt unable to rebut 1914. Despite his treatment by French, in 1925, he rushed across Europe to act as a pallbearer at French's funeral, an act appreciated by French's son.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{bring myself}} when I {{contemplate}} how <b>much</b> <b>his</b> influence and efficiency may be thrown away, when {{he becomes a}} prominent supporter of parliamentary reform, for from that instant he becomes the tool and slave of every worthless adventurer. He is born aristocratic, that is his station in the country; one that enables him if he acts in that sphere, to defend the rights and liberties of the people, whom he ought to consider as under his special care and guardianship.|$|E

25|$|Mary {{takes the}} {{children}} to visit their father at the bank where he works ("Precision and Order"). There, George is busy dealing with possible investment clients: firstly, an ambitious man named Herr Von Hussler with an elaborate money-making scheme, and then a middle-class man named John Northbrook with a simple factory project. George is furious when Mary turns up with the children, but an innocent question asked by Jane (What's more important, a good man or a good idea?) makes him realise how <b>much</b> <b>his</b> values have changed ("A Man Has Dreams") since he was an idealistic young man. He then decides to accept Northbrook's project and rejects Von Hussler's, but unfortunately things take {{a turn for the}} worse afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} {{would run}} through every ship, raising morale and instilling discipline, but his relation with his captains was degrading rapidly after his popular nephew, Dom António de Noronha, {{died in a}} sortie on land. One episode was relevant, as one fidalgo Rui Dias had been disobeying the governor's orders, sneaking out of his ship {{to meet with the}} women that Timoja had captured, and were locked in a cabin on the governor's own flagship. Upon finding of this blatant disobedience, Albuquerque ordered him to be immediately hanged. With the noose around his neck, mutiny sparked among the ranks of Portuguese fidalgos in the armada - who objected not so <b>much</b> <b>his</b> execution but {{the fact that he was}} being hanged and not beheaded as befitted a fellow nobleman. Albuquerque was, however, resolute. Dias was hanged and several of the rebellious captains arrested, though only for a few days.|$|E
500|$|Before Major Charles Sweeney {{took off}} on the mission, Purnell took him aside {{and asked him if}} he knew how much the bomb cost.

Purnell then told him: [...] "I'd suggest you keep those relative values in mind for this mission." ...|$|E

McCartney also had a fiery [...] "on-off" [...] relationship with Iris Caldwell, the younger sister of singer Rory Storm, who refused to bow to McCartney's demands. After one argument, Caldwell poured a bowl of sugar over his head, but when McCartney turned up the next day, she had to phone her new boyfriend, George Harrison, to cancel their date.|$|E
500|$|Next day, Amundsen asked Johansen why he and Prestrud {{had been}} so late.

Amundsen would later inform Nansen that Johansen had been [...] "violently insubordinate"; as a result, he was excluded from the polar party, which Amundsen now reduced to five. Johansen was placed {{under the command of}} Prestrud, <b>much</b> <b>his</b> junior as an explorer, in a party that would explore King Edward VII Land. Stubberud was persuaded to join them, leaving Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Bjaaland, Hassel and Wisting as the revised South Pole party.|$|E
500|$|On the ice, Stewart showed good {{judgment}} as a defenceman and rarely took {{himself out of}} position to throw a hit. His coach in Detroit, Jack Adams, called Stewart [...] "one of the best blueliners in the game", and claimed {{he was the best}} defenceman in Red Wings history. [...] Regarded as a good skater, he was able to clear the puck out of his zone and rarely turned it over to the other team. Clare Martin said he was a [...] "defensive defenceman" [...] and that he [...] "didn't carry the puck too <b>much</b> ... <b>His</b> job was defence and everybody in the league knew it." ...|$|E
