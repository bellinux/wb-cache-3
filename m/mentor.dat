40|$|AbstractDistance <b>mentoring</b> {{enabled the}} {{accounting}} graduates {{who participated in}} the Chartered Accountant's Relevant Experience (CARE) programme to appoint the <b>mentors</b> outside their workplaces. It solved the problem of getting <b>mentors</b> (the Chartered Accountants), particularly in the workplaces with insufficient Chartered Accountants. Participation in CARE was a compulsory practical experience requirement, enforced by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) since year 2009. However, in year 2014, the Committee to Strengthen the Accountancy Profession in Malaysia (CSAP) argued on the ineffectiveness of distance <b>mentoring.</b> In Malaysia, little attention has been given on understanding on the effectiveness of distance <b>mentoring</b> in CARE. In the nurses’ <b>mentoring</b> programme, distance <b>mentoring</b> was effectively implemented. Particularly, it overcame the issue of insufficient <b>mentors</b> in the United States. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to identify the factors influencing the effective distance <b>mentoring</b> in the nursing <b>mentoring</b> programme. It explores how technology has supported connectivity in distance <b>mentoring.</b> In the theoretical perspective, this paper extended the concept of distance <b>mentoring</b> in the lens of <b>mentoring</b> theory.

In all, 136 students undertaking a second-year business training and development course <b>mentored</b> 161 student mentees from a university pathway program or from a first year business course. <b>Mentors</b> paired up with mentees from a different cultural background to their own, and then met {{at least three times}} as part of their course requirements. Feedback from both <b>mentors</b> and mentees regarding the program was largely positive, and a measure of success was that 45 % of both <b>mentors</b> and mentees wished to continue the relationship with <b>mentoring</b> partners after the completion of <b>mentoring</b> requirements. <b>Mentors</b> and <b>mentors</b> were highly positive about the value of <b>mentoring,</b> for mentees particularly in regard to increasing information about the university and for <b>mentors</b> the value of the <b>mentoring</b> relationship. The challenges of embedding the <b>mentoring</b> program in a business course included the short duration of the <b>mentoring</b> and the lack of commitment from some volunteer mentees.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To explore {{perceptions}} of, {{participation in}} {{and satisfaction with}} <b>mentoring</b> programmes among young clinicians and researchers in rheumatology in Europe. To identify <b>mentoring</b> needs and expectations focusing on gender-specific differences. METHODS A survey on <b>mentoring</b> in rheumatology was distributed to young clinicians and researchers in rheumatology in Europe through the EMEUNET network. RESULTS We received 248 responses from 30 European countries. Although 82 % of respondents expressed {{the need for a}} formal <b>mentoring</b> scheme by EULAR, only 35 % participated in <b>mentoring</b> programmes and merely 20 % were very satisfied with <b>mentoring.</b> Respondents very satisfied with <b>mentoring</b> were more likely to participate in research, but not clinical <b>mentoring</b> programmes. Career <b>mentoring</b> was perceived as the most beneficial type of <b>mentoring</b> for career development by 46 % of respondents, only 35 % of respondents, however, declared the existence of career <b>mentoring</b> programmes in their country. There was no gender difference considering participation in <b>mentoring</b> programmes. Women, however, tended to be less satisfied than men with existing <b>mentoring</b> programmes and considered expectations from <b>mentoring</b> as more important for their career development, especially when pertaining to career planning, greater autonomy/responsibility and establishing new networks/collaborations. CONCLUSIONS Career <b>mentoring,</b> especially in the clinical setting, was recognised as a major unmet need of existing <b>mentoring</b> programmes in rheumatology in Europe. Gender-specific differences were identified in the expectations from <b>mentoring.</b> Given this and the importance of <b>mentoring</b> for career prosperity of young physicians and scientists, our survey represents the first step towards developing and refining <b>mentoring</b> programmes in rheumatology in Europe...|$|R

ABSTRACT: Youths, aged between 15 and 24 years, in secondary schools in Kenya, have been facing challenges such as drugs and substance abuse; negative peer pressure; unemployment and societal negative perceptions among others. This {{has led to the}} youth being labeled as source of society’s problems rather than its potential asset. Various interventions have been established such as talent nurturing programs, revival of youth polytechnics, entrepreneurship trainings and youth <b>mentoring</b> programs. In Kenya, <b>mentoring</b> is a relatively new concept though studies done in developed countries have shown that <b>mentoring</b> has resulted to youth empowerment. However, little has been documented about <b>mentoring</b> relationships in Kenya; hence this study established the influence of type of <b>mentoring</b> relationship on youth empowerment. A sample of 107 youth was randomly sampled from the purposively selected secondary schools with <b>mentoring</b> programs. Majority of the respondents were involved in more than one type of <b>mentoring</b> relationship at any given time. Those involved in traditional <b>mentoring</b> which is an informal type of <b>mentoring</b> relationship were 98. 1 %; they were also in formal type of <b>mentoring</b> relationships; peer and reverse <b>mentoring</b> were common at 91. 6 %; team <b>mentoring</b> (78. 5 %); situational <b>mentoring</b> (69. 2 %); group <b>mentoring</b> (57. 0 %); flash <b>mentoring</b> (56. 1 %) and E/tele <b>mentoring</b> (44. 9 %).

30|$|The {{current study}} {{suggests}} that instrumental, socioemotional, and negative <b>mentoring</b> behaviors may have implications for scientist identity among undergraduates who are historically underrepresented in science. Of the three forms of <b>mentoring,</b> instrumental <b>mentoring</b> explained the most variance in undergraduates’ scientist identity, which {{suggests that it is}} especially important for undergraduates to receive skill-based guidance from their <b>mentors.</b> The associations between <b>mentoring</b> and scientist identity varied depending on whether we considered <b>mentoring</b> evaluations from undergraduates versus their faculty <b>mentors.</b> Moreover, qualitative data from <b>mentors</b> revealed challenges in <b>mentoring</b> relationships that were not captured through the quantitative data from undergraduates. Thus, from a methodological standpoint, future research may benefit from taking an approach that can provide insight into the dynamic complexity of <b>mentoring</b> relationships.|$|R
