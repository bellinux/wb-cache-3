40|$|Image-based {{remote sensing}} is one {{promising}} technique for precision crop management. In this study, {{the use of}} an ultra light aircraft (ULA) equipped with broadband imaging sensors based on commercial digital cameras was investigated to characterize crop nitrogen status in cases of combined nitrogen and water stress. The acquisition system was composed of two Canon® EOS 400 D digital cameras: an original RGB camera <b>measuring</b> <b>luminance</b> in the Red, Green and Blue spectral bands, and a modified camera equipped with an external band-pass filter <b>measuring</b> <b>luminance</b> in the near-infrared. A 5 month experiment was conducted on a sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) trial consisting of three replicates. In each replicate, two sugarcane cultivars were grown with two levels of water input (rainfed/irrigated) and three levels of nitrogen (0, 65 and 130 kg/ha). Six ULA flights, coupled with ground crop measurements, took place during the experiment. For nitrogen status characterisation, three indices were tested from the closed canopy: the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), the green normalised difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and a broadband version of the simple ratio pigment index (hereafter referred to as the SRPIb), calculated from the ratio between blue and red bands of the digital camera. The indices were compared with two nitrogen crop variables: leaf nitrogen content (NL) and canopy nitrogen content (NC). SRPIb showed the best correlation (R 2 = 0. 7) with NL, independently of the water and the N treatment. NDVI and GNDVI were best correlated with NC values with correlation coefficients of 0. 7 and 0. 64 respectively, but the regression coefficients were dependent on the water and N treatment. These results showed that SRPIb could characterise the nitrogen status of sugarcane crop, even in the case of combined stress, and that such acquisition systems are promising for crop nitrogen monitoring.

The subjects were initially subjected to clinical inquiry and ophthalmological exam. Subjects then performed psychophysical tests to measure spatial contrast thresholds using sine wave gratings of different spatial frequencies and contrasts and chromatic discrimination thresholds using the Mollon-Reffin test.

Ten subjects had some degree of color vision loss, which was quite severe in seven cases. All subjects had normal luminance contrast sensitivity.

40|$|Visual {{experiments}} in psychology, psychophysics, and cognitive neuroscience require precise control over stimulus characteristics, such as luminance and contrast. In such experiments, stimuli {{are most often}} presented using computer monitors. These monitors bear an often neglected and rarely reported source of experimental confounds and uncontrolled variation: they take a warm-up time in which their luminance systematically changes until a stable level is eventually reached. Here we demonstrate this problem by <b>measuring</b> <b>luminance</b> over time for five different monitors. Results indicate that not only the warm-up time but also the course that the warm-up takes can vary greatly between different monitors. To address this problem, we propose a simple method of approximating a monitor's warm-up time, which takes into account theoretical considerations of the specific experiment. On this basis, we suggest a standardized experimental procedure and a standardized way of reporting its results to enable experimenters to control for monitor warm-up time...|$|E
40|$|Because {{luminance}} is {{the only}} value to which our sight responds, its measurement becomes {{important in terms of}} ensuring the proper function of vision. Nowadays luminance measuring can be made by conventional methods, such as direct using of luminance meter. However an entirely new method of <b>measuring</b> <b>luminance</b> levels is coming. This method is based on using luminance analyzers which work using a digital photography for the analysis of luminance.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Automated perimetry is of {{fundamental}} importance in assessing visual function in glaucoma. A technique was evaluated to perform high spatial resolution automated perimetry {{to allow a}} more detailed assessment of the luminance sensitivity in selected regions of the visual field than is possible with conventional perimetry.  METHOD—High spatial resolution perimetry was performed using a Humphrey automated perimeter by <b>measuring</b> <b>luminance</b> sensitivity across a 9  by 9  degree custom grid of 100  test locations with a separation between adjacent locations of 1  degree. Quantitative analysis of the raw and Gaussian filtered thresholds was performed to assess the repeatability of the technique in normals, glaucoma suspects, and glaucoma patients.  RESULTS—The testing protocol was well tolerated by all subjects. High spatial resolution perimetry in glaucomatous eyes demonstrated fine luminance sensitivity loss not suspected with conventional perimetry. High spatial resolution perimetry also demonstrated reproducible areas of sensitivity loss in some glaucomatous eyes {{in areas of the}} visual field which appear normal with conventional programmes. The repeatability of the technique correlated with mean threshold sensitivity and was substantially improved to clinically acceptable levels by Gaussian filtering the thresholds.  CONCLUSION—This technique of high spatial resolution perimetry allows the practical assessment of selected regions of the visual field at higher resolution than conventional perimetry, and may be clinically useful in glaucoma. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Dyslexia {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{learning}} disabilities affecting millions of people worldwide. Although exact causes of dyslexia are not well-known, a deficit in the magnocellular pathway may play a role. We examined possible deficiency of magnocellular, as compared to parvocellular and koniocellular pathway function by <b>measuring</b> <b>luminance</b> and color perception. Methods: Visual stimuli consisted of a series of natural images, divided into layers of luminance, red-green and blue-yellow, which probed magnocellular, parvocellular, and koniocellular pathways, respectively. Thirteen children with dyslexia and 13 sex- and age- matched controls performed three psychophysical tasks. In the first task, subjects were instructed to match the contrast of luminance (magno) and red-green (parvo) images to that of the blue-yellow (konio) images. In the second task, subjects detected the isoluminant point of red-green images to probe parvocellular pathway. In the third task, temporal processing was assessed by measuring reaction time and percentage of correct responses in an identification task using four categories of images, activating all three pathways. Results: The dyslexic group had significantly elevated luminance and color contrast thresholds and higher isoluminant point ratio in comparison to the control group. Furthermore, they had significantly less correct responses than the control group for the blue-yellow images. Conclusion: We may suggest that dyslexic subjects might suffer from both magnocellular and parvocellular deficits. Moreover, our results show partial impairment of the koniocellular pathway. Thus, dyslexia might be associated with deficits in all three visual pathways...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} novel {{methodology}} {{for the detection}} and analysis of visual anomalies on challenging surfaces (metallic).

The reflectance, in each pixel, is modelled by means of a projection of the <b>measured</b> <b>luminances</b> onto a basis of geometric functions, in this case, the Discrete Modal Decomposition (DMD) basis. However, a robust detection and analysis of surface visual anomalies requires that the method must not be affected neither by the geometry (sensor and surface orientation) nor by the texture pattern orientation of the inspected surface. We therefore introduce a rotation-invariant representation on the DMD, from which we devise saliency maps representing the local differences on reflectances. The methodology is tested on different engineering metallic samples exhibiting several types of defects. Compared to other saliency assessments, the results of our methodology demonstrate the best performance regarding anomaly detection, localisation and analysis...|$|R
50|$|PenTile RGBG layout used in AMOLED and plasma {{displays}} uses green pixels interleaved with alternating red {{and blue}} pixels. The human eye is most sensitive to green, especially for high resolution luminance information. The green subpixels are mapped to input pixels on a one-to-one basis. The {{red and blue}} subpixels are subsampled, reconstructing the chroma signal at a lower resolution. The luminance signal is processed using adaptive subpixel rendering filters to optimize reconstruction of high spatial frequencies from the input image, wherein the green subpixels provide {{the majority of the}} reconstruction. The red and blue subpixels are capable of reconstructing the horizontal and vertical spatial frequencies, but not the highest of the diagonal. Diagonal high spatial frequency information in the red and blue channels of the input image are transferred to the green subpixels for image reconstruction. Thus the RG-BG scheme creates a color display with one third fewer subpixels than a traditional RGB-RGB scheme but with the same <b>measured</b> <b>luminance</b> display resolution.

This is essential whenever optical components are positioned in close proximity (near-field) of the light source in order to perform accurate ray tracing simulations. However, a ray file {{does not allow for}} a direct simulation of the spatial luminance distribution, i. e. luminance map, by off-the-shelf ray tracers. Simulating luminance maps of light sources or luminaires is especially important in general lighting in order to predict their general perception when viewed by the observer, and more specific, the perception of glare of luminaires having a non-uniform luminance distribution. To enable the simulation of luminance maps while maintaining the high accuracy offered by a ray file, a sampling method is presented.
