500|$|The transfer, in 2007, {{coincided with}} an upturn in Ebsary's career.

In the last double-header of the season, against Queensland, she made {{consecutive}} half-centuries {{for the first time}} in her career. In the first match she made 72 before taking 4/46 to help secure a 104-run win, before scoring 62 the next day to lay the foundation for a five-wicket win. Ebsary scored 236 runs at 29.50; her previous best WNCL aggregate was 149. However, she did have trouble in running between the wickets; three of her eight dismissals were run outs.
