50|$|Many {{electronic}} {{transitions in}} conjugated -systems {{are from a}} predominantly bonding molecular orbital (<b>MO)</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> predominantly antibonding <b>MO</b> (π <b>to</b> π*), but electrons from non-bonding lone pairs can also be promoted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> -system <b>MO</b> (n <b>to</b> π*) as often happens in charge-transfer complexes. <b>A</b> HOMO <b>to</b> LUMO transition is made by an electron if it is allowed by the selection rules for electromagnetic transitions. Conjugated systems of fewer than eight conjugated double bonds absorb only in the ultraviolet region and are colorless to the human eye. With every double bond added, the system absorbs photons of longer wavelength (and lower energy), and the compound ranges from yellow to red in color. Compounds that are blue or green typically do not rely on conjugated double bonds alone.|$|R

40|$|Market {{orientation}} is an organization-wide concept that helps explain sustained competitive advantage (SCA). Since networks become ever more important, {{especially in the}} service sector, there is need to expand the concept of <b>MO</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> network setting. In line with Narver and Slater (1990), the concept of Market Orientation of Networks (MONW) is developed. This study indicates how MONW relates to the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and the industrial organization (IO) view in explaining SCA. It is argued that MONW has direct and indirect effects on SCA. More precisely, the antecedent effect of MONW to resources and industry structure is considered...|$|R

50|$|Prithvi III {{class is}} a {{two-stage}} surface-to-surface missile. The first stage is solid fueled with a 16 metric ton force (157 kN) thrust motor. The second stage is liquid-fueled.

Dhanush is a system consisting of a stabilization platform and the missile. It is a customized version of the Prithvi and is certified for sea worthiness. Dhanush has to be launched from a hydraulically stabilized launch pad. Its low range acts against it and thus {{it is seen as}} <b>a</b> weapon either <b>to</b> be used <b>to</b> destroy <b>an</b> aircraft carrier or an enemy port.
