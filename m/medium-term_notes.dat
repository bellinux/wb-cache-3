50|$|Since ETNs are unsecured, unsubordinated debts, {{their risk}} is that of bonds of similar {{priority}} in the company's capital structure. Often issued off <b>medium-term</b> <b>note</b> shelves, ETNs would be pari passu with other debt issued off the same shelf. Therefore, ETNs are backed by the credit of the underwriting issuer. Like other debt securities, ETNs do not have voting rights. Unlike other debt securities, interest is not paid during the term of most ETNs.|$|R
40|$|The asset-backed {{securities}} (ABS) market suffered a major setback during {{the financial crisis}} that began in 2007. Its role in the broader market collapse has been well documented, but the need to restore a healthy ABS market is equally clear. Indeed, North American policymakers have readily acknowledged that this market must {{play a major role}} in the global economic recovery and policymakers have recently moved beyond addressing the urgency of restarting the ABS market to considering its reform. An analysis of current reform proposals guides suggestions for a policy approach that reflects Canadian market realities. Specifically, it would be prudent in the Canadian context to impose new disclosure requirements for all public market <b>medium-term</b> <b>note</b> issuance.

50|$|In finance, a day count {{convention}} {{determines how}} interest accrues over {{time for a}} variety of investments, including bonds, notes, loans, mortgages, <b>medium-term</b> <b>notes,</b> swaps, and forward rate agreements (FRAs). This determines the number of days between two coupon payments; thus, calculating the amount transferred on payment dates and also the accrued interest for dates between payments. The day count is also used to quantify periods of time when discounting a cash-flow to its present value. When a security such as a bond is sold between interest payment dates, the seller is eligible to some fraction of the coupon amount.|$|E
50|$|The {{short-term}} securities that a SIV issues often contain two tiers of liabilities, junior and senior, with a leverage ratio ranging from 10 to 15. The senior debt is invariably rated AAA/Aaa/AAA and A-1+/P-1/F1 (usually by two rating agencies). The junior debt {{may or may}} not be rated, but when rated it is usually in the BBB area. There may be a mezzanine tranche rated A. The senior debt is a pari passu combination of <b>medium-term</b> <b>notes</b> (MTN) and commercial paper (CP). The junior debt traditionally comprises puttable, rolling 10-year bonds, but shorter maturities and bullet notes became more common.|$|E
5000|$|A {{medium-term}} note (MTN) is a debt note that usually matures (is paid back) in 5-10 years, but the term {{may be less}} than one year or as long as 100 years. They can be issued on a fixed or floating coupon basis. Floating rate <b>medium-term</b> <b>notes</b> {{can be as simple as}} paying the holder a coupon linked to Euribor +/- basis points or can be more complex structured notes linked, for example, to swap rates, treasuries, indices, etc. When they are issued to investors outside the US, they are called [...] "Euro Medium Term Notes" [...] (EMTN). Issuance of MTNs to investors based in the US requires a separate US MTN program.|$|E

5000|$|A {{structured}} {{investment vehicle}} (SIV) is a non-bank financial institution established to earn a credit spread between the longer-term assets held in its portfolio and the shorter-term liabilities it issues with significantly less leverage (10-15 times) than traditional banks (25-50 times). They are simple credit spread lenders, frequently [...] "lending" [...] by investing in securitisations but also by investing in corporate bonds and funding by issuing commercial paper and <b>medium-term</b> <b>notes,</b> which were usually rated AAA until {{the onset of the}} financial crisis. They did not expose themselves to either interest-rate or currency risk and typically held asset to maturity. SIV's differ from asset-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations in that they are permanently capitalized and have an active management team. They do not wind {{down at the end of}} their financing term, but roll liabilities over in the same way that traditional banks do.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the liquidity of large issues, this study tests for yield differences between corporate bonds and <b>medium-term</b> <b>notes.</b> In the sample, <b>medium-term</b> <b>notes</b> {{have an average}} issue size of $ 4 million, compared with $ 265 million for bonds. Among <b>medium-term</b> <b>notes</b> that have the same issuance date, the same maturity date, and the same corporate issuer, the authors find no relation between size and yields. Moreover, bonds and <b>medium-term</b> <b>notes</b> have statistically equivalent yields. Thus, rather than suggesting that large issues have greater liquidity, these findings indicate that large and small securities issued by the same borrower are close substitutes.
