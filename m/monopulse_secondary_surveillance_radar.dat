50|$|The Airports Authority of India has {{installed}} an advanced {{airport surveillance radar}} (ASR) as well as <b>monopulse</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> (MSSR). In addition, a surface movement radar was installed for effective monitoring of flights in the runway and parking bays.|$|E
50|$|Secondary {{surveillance}} radar (SSR) is a radar system used in {{air traffic control}} (ATC), that not only detects and measures the position of aircraft i.e. bearing, but also requests additional information from the aircraft itself such as its identity and altitude. Unlike primary radar systems that measure the bearing of targets using the detected reflections of radio signals, SSR relies on targets equipped with a radar transponder, that replies to each interrogation signal by transmitting a response containing encoded data. SSR {{is based on the}} military identification friend or foe (IFF) technology originally developed during World War II, therefore the two systems are still compatible. <b>Monopulse</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> (MSSR), Mode S, TCAS and ADS-B are similar modern methods of secondary surveillance.|$|E
50|$|The {{second major}} {{improvement}} is increased azimuth accuracy. With PSRs and old SSRs, azimuth {{of the aircraft}} {{is determined by the}} half split (centroid) method. The half split method is computed by recording the azimuth of the first and last replies from the aircraft, as the radar beam sweeps past its position. Then the midpoint between the start and stop azimuth is used for aircraft position. With MSSR (<b>monopulse</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar)</b> and Mode S, the radar can use the information of one reply to determine azimuth. This is calculated based on the RF phase of the aircraft reply, as determined by the sum and difference antenna elements, and is called monopulse. This monopulse method results in superior azimuth resolution, and removes target jitter from the display.|$|E

It describes the patch array elements and the synthesis for the <b>secondary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> array, considering both elevation and azimuth patterns for sum, difference, and sidelobe-suppression beams, and suspended stripline couplers. The utilization of multilayer techniques allows the connection of layers with patch radiating elements and layers with beamforming networks...|$|R

40|$|A low-cost, multiple-purpose, and high-precision timing {{test setup}} for the {{measurements}} of secondary Mode S radar transmission signal was proposed. The {{goal was to}} fully guarantee compliance of the proposed transmitter under test with the really hard International Civil Aircraft Organization requirements using traditional measurement equipment, which was difficult or even impossible to ensure up to now. The low-cost structure proposed in this paper allows the user to perform measurements independently of the measurements performed by the pieces of test equipment shelled by the manufacturer of radar, {{which is a very}} important aspect since the independence of the verifications is a mandatory requirement established by the safety standards of civil aviation. The proposed setup has been used to verify several transmitters with some defects that are not detected by <b>monopulse</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> specific pieces of test equipment that are focused on more high-level functionalities. It also is valid and it has been used, as a general-purpose setup, for testing other radio navigation aids...|$|E

50|$|The {{airborne}} radar data processor supports track-while-scan (TWS), which {{is required to}} form target tracks after receiving data from the various sensors of ASP, such as the primary <b>radar</b> and the <b>secondary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar,</b> which operate in TWS mode. The ARDP correlates the target plots from scan to scan to maintain the target tracks.

50|$|Transponder {{codes are}} four digit numbers {{transmitted}} by the transponder in an aircraft {{in response to}} a <b>secondary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> interrogation signal to assist air traffic controllers in traffic separation.

50|$|Primary <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> {{does not}} require any {{cooperation}} from the aircraft. It is robust {{in the sense that}} surveillance outage failure modes are limited to those associated with the ground <b>radar</b> system. <b>Secondary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> depends on active replies from the aircraft. Its failure modes include the transponder aboard the aircraft. Typical ADS-B aircraft installations use the output of the navigation unit for navigation and for cooperative surveillance, introducing a common failure mode that must be accommodated in air traffic surveillance systems.|$|R
50|$|ADS-B In {{equipment}} will {{be based}} on user perceived benefit, but is expected to be providing increased situational awareness and efficiency benefits within this segment. Those aircraft who choose to equip in advance of any mandate will see benefits associated with preferential routes and specific applications. Limited radar decommissioning will begin in the time frame with an ultimate goal of a 50% reduction in the <b>secondary</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> infrastructure.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} on Friday 23 December 2016 that the flights to Amsterdam {{would be cut}} in 2017 as Flybe believed that the radar coverage is not adequate.

50|$|The current {{generation}} sensor can only detect and track pulsed emissions, {{due to the}} requirement to measure the time of arrival of pulses.
