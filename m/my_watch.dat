Elizabeth Brundage, three years younger than her husband, was a trained soprano, a talent she exhibited for visitors to the Brundage home. She had {{a strong interest in}} classical music, one which may not have been fully shared by her husband, who said of a performance of Wagner's Die Walküre that it [...] "started at 7o'clock, at 10:00pm I looked at <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> and it registered exactly 8o'clock". She died at age 81 in 1971.|$|E
500|$|At the time, it was {{unheard of}} for a debuting artist {{to receive the}} coveted rating. Author Matthew Gasteier writes, “It's {{difficult}} to overestimate the impact of receiving the five out of five mics, the first such rating given to any new release by the magazine since its then-editor Reginald Dennis put a moratorium on them." [...] Reginald Dennis, former music editor of the magazine and XXL co-founder, later recounted, [...] "Awarding records 5 mics – classic status – has always been, on some levels, troubling to me. I mean, we are not only saying that a particular piece of music is superior to everything that is out now, {{but it will be}} better than most things released in the future as well [...] I only gave one 5 under <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> and it went to Nas's Illmatic." [...] Dennis cited it as [...] "the only time I ever broke the 'no 5' rule" [...] and added, [...] "I told Jon that we'd work all of that stuff out {{when it was time to}} review the album. But everyday, Jon was like, 'yo, this album is 5 mics — seriously, Reg, 5 mics!' ...|$|E

I think when you watch the dailies, the film that you shoot every day, you're very excited by it and very optimistic about how it's going to work. And when you see it the first time you put the film together, the roughest cut, is when you want to go home and open up your veins and get in a warm tub and just go away.

2500|$|At {{their wedding}} feast, Tyrion gets very drunk, irritating both Sansa and Tywin, who counsels {{his son to}} stop {{drinking}} and begin trying to conceive a child with his new wife. Joffrey, after threatening to rape Sansa, calls for the traditional bedding ceremony to begin, but his plan is thwarted when Tyrion threatens to castrate an outraged Joffrey. Tywin defuses the situation, and Tyrion is able to avoid punishment, using his intoxication as an excuse. Tyrion leaves the feast with Sansa, and though Tywin has ordered Tyrion to consummate his marriage, he tells Sansa he will not share her bed until she wants him to. Sansa asks what Tyrion will do if that never happens, and Tyrion jokes by saying a phrase from the Night's Watch vow, [...] "And so <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> begins", meaning that he is resigned to never having sex within their marriage.|$|E

2500|$|In The Avengers #75 (April 1970), the Scarlet Witch is reintroduced to {{the team}} and soon becomes a love {{interest}} for the Vision. Thomas recounted, [...] "I felt that a romance of some sort would help the character development in The Avengers, and the Vision was a prime candidate because he appeared only in that mag... as did Wanda, for that matter. So they became a pair, for just such practical considerations. It would also, I felt, add to the development I was doing on the Vision's attempting to become ‘human.’" [...] Thomas also {{came up with the}} idea of the Vision having been created from the body of the Human Torch, but only planted a vague clue to this (in The Avengers #93) before leaving the series. It was finally followed up in The Avengers #134–135. Writer Steve Englehart explained, [...] "That plot was well known in-house for years, and since Roy [...] and Neal [...] hadn't had a chance to do it, I did it on <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> with Roy’s blessing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Department of Defense's {{preliminary}} {{concerns for}} holding, housing, and interrogating captured prisoners {{on the battlefield}} were raised during the military build-up prior to the Iraq War. Because Saddam Hussein’s military forces surrendered when faced with military action, many within the DOD, including Rumsfeld and United States Central Command General Tommy Franks, decided {{it was in the}} best interest of all to hand these prisoners over to their respective countries. Additionally, it was determined that maintaining a large holding facility was, at the time, unrealistic. Instead, the use of many facilities such as Abu Ghraib would be utilized to house prisoners of interest prior to handing them over, and Rumsfeld defended the Bush administration's decision to detain enemy combatants. Because of this, critics, including members of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, would hold Rumsfeld responsible for the ensuing Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal. Rumsfeld himself said: [...] "These events occurred on <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> as Secretary of Defense. I am accountable for them." [...] He offered his resignation to President Bush in the wake of the scandal, but it was not accepted.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} version leaked early on several mixtapes. Then, a second version, {{with the first}} two verses from the {{original version}}, a verse from Cory Gunz and the final verse from the album version, was released prior to the album version. [...] "A Milli" [...] was played several times when sampling the record before its release, and was originally slated to appear on Tha Carter III in multiple versions as [...] "skit-like" [...] tracks, featuring artists such as Tyga, Cory Gunz, Hurricane Chris, and Lil Mama though the tracks never made the final cut.

[...] "A Milli" [...] was ranked the #1 Hip-Hop song of 2008 by MTV. The song samples [...] "Don't Burn Down the Bridge" [...] by Gladys Knight & the Pips. The sample is different in both early and final versions. While the early version plays the sample as it is, the final version adds a filter effect to the sample. In addition, the main vocal sample is from the Vampire Mix of [...] "I Left My Wallet in El Segundo" [...] by A Tribe Called Quest.

2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{letters from}} Violet Keppel from Paris assuring her she only had feelings for her, Sackville-West had almost fainted {{when she read}} an announcement in a newspaper of Violet's engagement to Major Denys Trefusis. Sackville-West's response was to travel to Paris to see Keppel, taking her to the Hotel Roosevelt where she wrote in her diary: [...] "I treated savagely, I made love to her, I had her, I didn't care, I only wanted to hurt Denys". Keppel had used the engagement {{as a way of}} eliciting the response from Sackville-West she had wanted, and the next day Major Trefusis [...] "almost turned white" [...] when he discovered his fiancee and Sackville-West together in bed, a discovery that came as a great shock as he believed the two were just friends, and had apparently believed that women were incapable of falling in love with one another. That night, Sackville-West had dinner alone at the Ritz while Keppel watched her lovingly from the window in her room at an adjoining hotel while Denys Trefusis laid on the bed crying. Under strong pressure from her mother Alice Keppel, a deeply depressed and suicidal Keppel did marry Major Trefusis, though she made it clear that she did not love him. Sackville-West called the marriage her greatest failure as she made a plan for Keppel to escape with her to avoid marrying Trefusis, but was too cowardly to carry it out, later writing [...] "I sat quite dazed in my room holding <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> in my hand and watching the hands tick past the hour of Violet's wedding. All the time, I knew, she was expecting a prearranged message from me, which I never sent".|$|E
