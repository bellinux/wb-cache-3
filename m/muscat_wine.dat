40|$|Although Muscat Blanc “à petit grains” and Red Muscat grape {{varieties}} are both cultivated in the Douro Demarcated Region (Portugal), only Muscat Blanc is currently authorized {{for the production}} of the fortified wine “Moscatel do Douro”. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the potential of the Red Muscat grape variety to be employed in the winemaking of Douro <b>Muscat</b> <b>wines.</b> Wines of both grape varieties were produced from the 2013 and 2014 harvests, and were chemically and sensory analysed 12 and 3 months after stopping the alcoholic fermentation, respectively. The Muscat Blanc “à petit grains” variety produced musts with higher sugar content than the red variety, but the final levels of sugar and ethanol were similar in all wines owing to the control of the fermentation time. Red <b>Muscat</b> <b>wines</b> presented higher concentrations of rose oxide and nerol than Muscat Blanc “à petit grains”; however, these differences were only significant in the youngest wines. Linalool and α-terpineol were found at higher levels in the 2013 Muscat Blanc “à petit grains” wines. No significant differences were found for the ester compounds, except for 2 -phenylethanol, which was higher in the Red <b>Muscat</b> <b>wines.</b> The 12 months old wines presented a higher total concentration of esters than the younger wines. No significant differences were found for the higher alcohols composition between the two grape varieties. The chromatic analysis showed that, besides having a redder tone, Red <b>Muscat</b> <b>wines</b> had a higher colour intensity and a more pure/saturated colour than Muscat Blanc “à petit grains” wines. The sensory analysis did not detect significant differences in the aromatic and gustatory profiles between the two grape varieties. The Red Muscat grape variety shows great potential to be employed in the production of <b>Muscat</b> fortified <b>wine</b> either as monovarietal or in blends with Muscat Blanc “à petit grains”. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

25|$|Metaxa {{comes in}} nine major varieties: Three Stars, Five Stars, Five Stars Honey Shot, Seven Stars, Twelve stars, Grande Fine, Private Reserve, Angels Treasure and AEN. The number of stars {{represents}} {{the number of}} years the blend is matured. The three and 5 star are not as different, but the 5 star is notably drier, making the alcohol more pronounced. The seven and twelve star are more flavoursome and complex, while the Twelve-star G.O.R. is again more dry, in this case because there is no addition of wine. In either of the two latter varieties, the smell and taste of the barrel in which the brandy matured is noticeable. The house of Metaxa has recently launched a new product, the Metaxa Twelve Star containing distillates matured for 12 years adding <b>Muscat</b> <b>wine</b> from the island of Samos, unlike the Metaxa Twelve Stars Grand Olympian Reserve. Metaxa Private Reserve is the most oldest member of Metaxa family. Only 5.000 numbered decanters of Metaxa Private Reserve are on the market containing distillates aged for 30 years from Spyros Metaxas' family barrels.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the wine}} renaissance of the 1960s, {{the quality of}} California's dessert and {{fortified}} wines have been dramatically improved. Beringer {{was one of the}} first to create a botrytized wine from Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. Though unlike in Sauternes, Beringer's wine was made of grapes regularly harvested and then introduced at the winery to Botrytis cinerea spores created in a laboratory. Since then California winemakers in places like the Anderson Valley AVA have found vineyards where this noble rot can occur naturally on the grapes. The Anderson and Alexander Valley AVAs have also developed a reputation for their Late Harvest wines made from Riesling. Several French and Italian style <b>Muscat</b> <b>wines</b> are produced throughout California and are known for their intense aromatics and balanced acidity. The port-style wines in California are often made from the traditional Portuguese wine grapes like Touriga Nacional, Tinta Cão and Tinta Roriz.

According to the partial least squares-discriminant analysis, wines from western regions could be discriminated with their higher Pb content. The red wines of two native grapes, Boǧazkere and Öküzgözü, were separated from the remaining varieties based on their high Ca and low B and Cu levels. Öküzgözü wines were different from Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon wines. Similarly, native Emir wines showed differences from <b>Muscat</b> <b>wines.</b> The effective variables for discrimination analysis were natural minerals (Sr, Li, Al, Ba, and B) and minerals originating from agricultural activities, processing, or pollution (Ca, Cu, Mg, Co, Pb, and Ni).
