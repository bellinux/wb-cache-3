40|$|Over {{the last}} half century, the {{widespread}} decline of bumblebees across the agricultural landscapes of Western Europe and North America has been well documented. This decline has undoubtedly been driven {{to a large extent}} by the intensification of agriculture, which has fragmented landscapes and removed large areas of suitable foraging habitat, nesting and hibernation sites. Consequently, some of the rarest Bombus species now persist only in isolated pockets of semi-natural habitat, which have been subjected to little agricultural intensification. Of the 25 Bombus species native to the UK, three species have gone extinct in recent decades and several others are severely threatened. Remaining populations of the UK’s rarest bumblebee, Bombus distinguendus, have become strongly associated with florally-rich <b>machair</b> grassland habitats found only in the North and West of Scotland and Western Ireland. <b>Machair,</b> a unique habitat that forms on soils rich in shell sand, has been maintained by rotational agricultural practices implemented by crofters. However, recent changes in crofting practices, which include the intensive grazing of <b>machair</b> in some areas, or conversely the abandonment of <b>machair</b> management all together in others, have resulted in sections of <b>machair</b> that have become degraded and consequently exhibit low floral abundance and species diversity. This has significant implications for species such as B. distinguendus, which have for the most part come to rely of the florally-rich swards of <b>machair</b> grassland. This thesis aimed to develop a greater understanding of how <b>machair</b> grassland habitats are utilised by foraging bumblebees, including B. distinguendus, and in turn examined the potential for restoring degraded areas of <b>machair</b> via a variety of methods. The research presented here examines the influence of current crofting practices on the abundance of bumblebees and their forage plant species and combines this information with a detailed exploration of the <b>machair</b> seed bank and potential <b>machair</b> restoration treatments. The specific foraging requirements of B. distinguendus were found to be similar to those of other long-tongued bumblebee species and the provision of plants from the Fabaceae family was found to be of particular importance. Current crofting practices implemented in the North and West of Scotland were, on the whole, found support low numbers of foraging bumblebees. Similarly, existing habitat management schemes, designed to provide early cover for corncrakes and foraging resources for bumblebees, were found to be largely ineffective in attracting B. distinguendus, when compared with florally-rich <b>machair</b> habitat. In addition, this research suggests that the existing <b>machair</b> seed bank is unlikely to provide a sufficient resource for reinstating florally-rich habitat to degraded areas of <b>machair.</b> However, this thesis has demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} implement seed mixes on <b>machair</b> which can reinstate species typical of <b>machair</b> plant communities and which also attract high numbers of foraging bumblebees. The findings of these habitat assessments and restoration trials are examined in full in the following chapters and implications for the future management of wildflower-rich <b>machair</b> are discussed throughout...|$|R

40|$|In plant ecology, {{understanding}} which species {{live where}} {{and why is}} fundamental for ensuring successful conservation management {{with the aim of}} maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. Biodiversity patterns in space can be empirically linked to spatially scaled environmental processes, providing a greater understanding to how plant species assemblages change along differing environmental gradients. In the same way, biodiversity patterns in time can be linked to temporal trends in the environment, empirically linking changes in vegetation to changes in the external environment. This furthers understanding of how plant communities are likely to respond to future scenarios of environmental change, providing an insight into future shifts in biodiversity patterns and, in turn, how his may influence valuable ecosystem functions and services upon which humans ultimately depend. Trends in human land use {{have been shown to be}} the single most influential driver of current global biodiversity change to date. This, coupled with a changing climate, suggests vegetation communities on a global scale are under increasing pressure to adapt to multiple dynamically changing environmental constraints. This thesis focuses on a globally-rare semi-natural, coastal grassland habitat termed ‘Machair’, renowned for its high biodiversity and cultural heritage importance. Confined solely to the north-western fringe of Europe, the <b>Machairs</b> have formed through unique combinations of geo-physiological and climatic conditions, and even more importantly, century-long associations with human land use through which the low-intensity intermediate disturbance is considered to be vital in maintaining its biodiversity value. However, change in the management of the <b>Machairs</b> alongside other environmental drivers of change, particularly climate, provides major concerns for the biodiversity value of this habitat. In this thesis, spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns of Machair vegetation are investigated to assess the major drivers of change and identify regions which may require future conservation efforts to restore and/or maintain the future biodiversity value of this globally-rare habitat. To achieve this, a spatio-temporal dataset of Scottish Machair vegetation first collected in 1976 - 77 and then re-surveyed in 2009 - 10 was used. Analyses found both climate and land use management to influence spatial and temporal vegetation patterns of Scotland’s Machair and Machair grassland. Climate was shown to operate at relatively broad scales (> 50 km), while the influence of different measurable components of climate was also found to significantly affect temporal turnover patterns of Machair grassland assemblages. Land use management, predominantly at a relatively fine scale...|$|E
40|$|Climate change {{scenarios}} for NW Scotland and the Western Isles envisage {{a combination of}} rising sea level, increased winter precipitation, and increased frequency and severity of winter storms. The flat, low-lying machair lands of the Uists are thus particularly vulnerable, not only from marine overtopping of coastal dune ridges, but also from inland flooding and restricted drainage, which may enhance the duration and area of seasonal standing waters within the machair lands. The drainage network of the Uist <b>machairs</b> is a legacy of historic drainage of a more extensive loch network, which now forms an intricately balanced complex of linked water bodies exhibiting {{a wide range of}} pH and salinity. Any future change in water levels would impose significant environmental shifts. The conservation importance of machair is significantly augmented by a pattern of rotational cultivation that largely employs traditional methods and provides species-rich fallows. This tradition is already under economic threat, and increased flooding could have far-reaching consequences for both agriculture and wildlife. The Uist machair systems have a range of inter-dependent, multiple-interest international conservation designations and the vulnerability of these is examined in a context that incorporates the vital human dimension...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The machair {{sand dune}} {{systems of the}} Outer Hebri-des of Scotland are a unique habitat, which is rare within both a global and European context. Unusually, the machair habitat also {{represents}} an agricultural resource {{that is very important}} to the Hebridean people, having been subject to both grazing and cultivation throughout the historical period. Following designation as an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) in 1988, the <b>machairs</b> of South Uist have been studied with the aim of understanding the links between agricultural practice and their plant community and ecosystem dynamics. This research focused primarily on the effects of cultivation prac-tices and their role in maintaining plant species richness and community and ecosystem stability. Within two carefully selected areas, the successional plant communities of machair at different stages of recovery follow-ing ploughing and cultivation of cereals and potato patches or ‘lazy beds ’ were identified at both a macro- and micro-level. Investigations of the vegetation recovery processes on turves taken from newly ploughed land indicated that the initial stages of recolonization are characterized primarily by rapid vegetative reproduction and growth, although re-vegetation by seeds is also an important factor. The implications of these findings for the long-term management of machair plant com-munities are discussed and in particular the need to maintain old cultivation practices such as shallow ploughing. The need for more detailed research into both seed banks and seed rain and into processes of vegetative reproduction is stressed...|$|E

If you are the author please contact PEARL Admin (pearladmin@plymouth. ac. uk) to discuss options. The machair systems of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland are renowned for the diversity and conservation value of their plant communities. However, machair systems have a restricted distribution and are prone to disturbance from both anthropogenic and environmental sources. The effects of two major anthropogenic and environmental disturbances (agriculture and burial by wind-blown sand) on the Kildonan and Drimsdale machair systems on South Uist, and the dynamic responses of machair vegetation to these human and natural agencies were described and quantified. The investigated machair systems comprised a diversity of sand dune, grassland and marginal vegetation types which were spatially distributed along a primary environmental gradient of soil organic matter, soil moisture and soil pH. Vegetation types influenced by the effects of cultivation, notably potato-bed successions, abandoned field systems and fallow areas were also a conspicuous component of the Kildonan and Drimsdale <b>machairs.</b> Re-vegetation following cultivation occurred primarily through vegetative processes. Sexual reproduction via seed within different machair vegetation types was limited. The numbers of viable seeds recorded from machair seed banks ranged from 7 mˉ² soil in foredune vegetation to 58 mˉ² soil in newly-ploughed cereal land. Densities of viable seeds recorded from the machair seed rain ranged from 2 mˉ² soil in the dune slack to 24 mˉ² soil in a potato patch, fallow for two years. These values represent the first estimates {{of the size of}} machair seed budgets. Glasshouse-based burial experiments examined the effects of inundation by sand on four machair vegetation types. Foredune grassland, dune slack, three-year fallow grassland and unploughed grassland vegetation exhibited the capacity to survive and re-emerge from both intermittent and single depositions of sand. In terms of effects on plant frequency, intermittent burial by five depositions of 1 cm of sand was more damaging than a single deposition of 5 cm. However, all vegetation types responded to both intermittent and single burial events primarily through a change in the number of individual plants, rather than through a change in the number of plant species. Five different responses to burial by sand were identified for machair species. The suspension of photosynthetic activity and the maintenance of a low dark respiration rate were identified as important physiological responses to burial. Photosynthetic activity of machair vegetation was resumed on denudation, indicating the existence of an elastic physiological response to burial. Ecological processes in the dune slack habitat and the responses of slack vegetation to its dynamic environment were subtly different to those characterizing the other investigated sub-communities. These differences were attributed to the fact that machair slacks are characterized by an historical ecology distinct from that of other areas of the machair system. It is suggested that the formulation of effective management plans and conservation strategies for the machair systems of the Outer Hebrides ultimately lies in an understanding of their historical ecology, and in their past management and environmental histories...|$|E
