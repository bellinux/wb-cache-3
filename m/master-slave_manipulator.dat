The motion of the slave arm must possess six independent degrees of freedom, three of translation and three of rotation to position gripping devices, and a tong squeeze motion to grip items. The motion of the slave arm must be coupled to the master arms that the position and the direction of the two arms correspond to. The coupling of the two arms must be bilateral and this means that forces at the slave end must be reflected at the master end and displacements produced at the slave end must be able to produce a displacement at the master end, with the slave arm being able to align itself in response to the constraints imposed by the task being done.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Force-Reflected Telepresence Teleoperation {{system has}} been widely used. Generally, force and torque sensors are {{installed}} on the robot to realize haptic perception.

30|$|Laparoscopic {{surgery is}} a {{commonly}} employed minimally invasive surgical techniques. In {{the case of}} conventional laparoscopic surgery, a surgeon operates using forceps passed through trocars (each approximately 5 – 10  mm in diameter) into a patient’s abdominal cavity while observing the image acquired by a laparoscope. Since only a small incision is made, the patient can recover sooner, and the overall medical costs are reduced. Therefore, laparoscopic surgery has great advantages for the patient, and its use has become widespread in recent years. However, laparoscopic surgery can only be performed by surgeons with advanced skills. One of the main difficulties in laparoscopic surgery is the restriction of the free motion of the forceps {{because of the size}} of the trocar. The position and posture of the gripper of the forceps cannot be changed freely in the patient’s abdominal cavity during the procedure because the shaft of the forceps is restricted by the trocar. Recently, many <b>master–slave</b> <b>manipulators</b> with articulated forceps have been used in laparoscopic surgery to solve this problem [1]. Compact and low-cost manually driven or motor-driven handheld articulated forceps have been developed for clinical use [2 – 4].|$|R
40|$|Maintenance {{operations}} on ITER tokamak components will be largely performed by remote handling. In previous work {{it was shown}} that representative maintenance tasks could be performed significantly faster with direct visual feedback than with camera feedback. In post-test interviews, operators indicated that they regarded the lack of 3 D perception as the primary factor hindering their performance. This paper discusses various techniques to improve depth perception in teleoperation, including stereo vision, head tracking, virtual camera views and depth gauges.

40|$|Transmission {{time delay}} in the {{communication}} channel of a manual control system is investigated. A time delay can exist in remote manipulation systems, caused by long communication distances or bandwidth limitations. Ferrell 1 conducted the first research in time-delayed manipulation using a two degree-of-freedom manipulator. His subjects, working at time delays of 1. 0, 2. 1, and 3. 2 s, could accomplish tasks even requiring great accuracy.

In experiments with a six degree-of-freedom <b>master-slave</b> <b>manipulator</b> system and time delays of 1. 0 to 6 s, Black 2 saw that subjects tried to use the move-and-wait strategy; but there were often difficulties. The subjects seemed to have a problem in holding the master arm stationary while waiting for feedback. Any undesired drifting of the master arm introduced a discrepancy between the positions of the master and slave. This discrepancy was not perceived because of the time delay. The subject would then begin his next move with an inherent error. The difficulty of effectively using the move-and-wait strategy with a <b>master-slave</b> <b>manipulator</b> suggested that rate control might be a more effective control mode with time delay...|$|E

40|$|Teleoperation {{has been}} under study from the mid 1940 s, when the first {{mechanical}} <b>master-slave</b> <b>manipulators</b> were built to allow safe handling of nuclear material within a hot cell. Since then, need to operate within dangerous, out of reach, uncomfortable, or hazardous environments has then motivated researchers to study teleoperation further. In this thesis, teleoperation of a hydraulic manipulator with electrically driven master manipulator was studied. The workspace of the hydraulic slave manipulator is 5 m in height and it can reach 3 m. The master manipulator has a workspace approximating full arm movement pivoting at the shoulder. Further, the slave manipulator is capable of lifting over 1000 kg, while the master manipulator can lift only 2 kg. Objective of this thesis is to implement virtual decomposition control (VDC) type controller to the master manipulator and create communication channel for the two manipulators. The VDC approach is a subsystem model based feedforward controller. Similar controller for the slave manipulator has been implemented previously. Performance of the developed teleoperation system will be evaluated with experimental implementation measuring the free space motion tracking in {{two degrees of freedom}} motion.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the current place of robotics in laparoscopic urological surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A {{review of the}} international literature was conducted to {{evaluate the}} various available endoscope robot systems and telemanipulator robots and to establish their practical limitations and their contribution to surgery. RESULTS: Robotic systems are based on various structures, which each present specific disadvantages. Two types of systems can be distinguished: endoscope robots and telemanipulator robots (complete robotic systems) with different degrees of complexity, dimensions and costs. Each system is different in terms of service rendered. Endoscope robot systems (EndoAssist, AESOP, LapMan) are reliable and {{eliminate the need for}} an assistant to hold the camera. Man-machine interfaces can be manual, by pedal or by voice recognition. They are relatively large and expensive, limiting their diffusion at the present time. Complete instrument-handling robots (<b>master-slave</b> <b>manipulators)</b> are currently represented by 2 robots (Zeus and Da Vinci) which have demonstrated their efficacy in many difficult operations. Their very high cost and their large dimensions also constitute limitations to their diffusion, making them inaccessible to the majority of centres. The urological community has largely contributed to the evaluation of robots in laparoscopic operations, as reflected by the large number of publications. CONCLUSION: Considerable technological progress has been made over recent years to make laparoscopic surgery more accessible. Current robotized tools are still imperfect systems, but, in the future, may possibly facilitate difficult laparoscopic operations, particularly in urology...|$|R
