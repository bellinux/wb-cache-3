40|$|Royal Academy {{schools from}} 1769. He {{exhibited}} at the Society of Artists 1765 – 71 and at the Royal Academy 1772 – 1807, and became miniature painter to the Duchess of York in 1792 and limner to the Prince Regent in 1803. He was in Edinburgh for several years in the mid 1790 s. He is not hitherto recorded as a pastellist, but the allegorical work corresponding to the engravings by George Keating and John Murphy appears, from its combination of colour and detail, {{to be the source}} [...] It may be the work {{exhibited at the}} Royal Academy in 1791 (no medium is indicated, but the work is not in the <b>miniatures</b> <b>section)</b> ...|$|R

25|$|The {{interior}} {{is covered with}} fine frescos and gilded carvings and includes a wainscot of rich tile work. The delicately blue and gold painted central dome depicts the Biblical story {{of the creation of}} the world and man's expulsion from Eden. Pendentives throughout the church are painted with a distinctly Armenian motif of a cherub's head surrounded by folded wings. The ceiling above the entrance is painted with delicate floral motifs in the style of Persian <b>miniature.</b> Two <b>sections,</b> or bands, of murals run around the interior walls: the top section depicts events from the life of Jesus, while the bottom section depicts tortures inflicted upon Armenian martyrs by the Ottoman Empire.|$|R
2500|$|Nickelodeon Universe is {{an indoor}} theme {{park in the}} center of the mall. The park {{features}} roller coasters, among numerous other rides and attractions, and is the largest indoor theme park in the United States. Unlike many indoor amusement parks, Nickelodeon Universe has a great deal of natural foliage in and about the park, and its floor has a wide variance in height – the highest ground level in the park is [...] above the lowest. The rides include the roller coasters SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge and Avatar Airbender, and a thrill ride called BrainSurge. The latter attraction bills itself as a [...] "rather peculiar" [...] ride. [...] It also has a <b>miniature</b> golfing <b>section</b> called Moose Mountain. This miniature golf course features eighteen holes and a relatively fast astroturf surface.|$|R

It was probably created for an unknown laywoman whose generic [...] "portrait" [...] is shown four times. It has been suggested she was from North Hinksey near Oxford, and possibly called Suzanna. Signed twice by [...] "W. de Brail", adding once [...] "qui. me depeint" [...] ("who painted me"). Despite its small size of 150 x 123 mm, it contains a large number of historiated initials and full page <b>miniatures</b> introducing <b>sections.</b>|$|R

50|$|Ambrosia is a {{variation}} on the traditional fruit salad. Most ambrosia recipes contain fresh or sweetened pineapple, mandarin oranges or fresh orange <b>sections,</b> <b>miniature</b> marshmallows, and coconut. Other ingredients can include maraschino cherries, bananas, strawberries, peeled grapes, or crushed pecans. Ambrosia can also include whipped cream (or whipped topping), sour cream, cream cheese, pudding, yogurt, or cottage cheese. The mixture is refrigerated for a few hours or overnight before serving. Although the name references the food of Greek gods, it is widely believed to be an American dish originated in the late 19th century.|$|R
5000|$|Colombe painted all the <b>miniatures</b> of this <b>section,</b> {{other than}} “Hell”, which was painted by a Limbourg brother. “Hell” {{is based on}} a {{description}} from a thirteenth-century Irish monk Tundal (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). This miniature may not have been originally intended for the manuscript. Meiss and subsequent writers have argued that the full-page miniatures that codicological data show were inserted on single leaves were not originally designed for the Très Riches Heures (including the Anatomical Man, folio 14v; The Fall, folio 25r; the Meeting of the Magi, folio 51v; the Adoration of the Magi, folio 52r; the Presentation, folio 54v; the Fall of the Rebel Angels, folio 64v; Hell, folio 108r; the Map of Rome, folio 141v). Margaret Manion, however, has suggested that, [...] "although the subjects are handled in an innovative manner, they fit {{within the context of the}} prayerbook and could well have been part of a developing collaborative plan." ...|$|R
40|$|Portfolio Contents: Symphony No. 104 - for {{orchestra}} From The Eumenides - for mezzo soprano and cello Lost Words - {{for large}} ensemble and singers String Quartet No. 2 - for string quartet String Quartet No. 3 - for string quartet 12 Miniatures - for amplified classical guitar Non-Stable Equilibrium - for violin and piano Commentary The portfolio of compositions contains seven pieces {{for a variety}} of vocal and instrumental and forces. Symphony No. 104, From The Eumenides, Lost Words, String Quartet No. 2 and 12 Miniatures are cycles of miniatures, while String Quartet No. 3 and Non-Stable Equilibrium are throughcomposed. The latter two pieces were also conceived in brief musical <b>sections.</b> Each individual <b>miniature</b> or <b>section</b> is typified by focus on a single musical idea and their sequence was determined with the aim of contrasting and complementing different musical characters and styles. As a rule, the musical material was instinctively conceived and the music intuitively written. In the compositional process, particular attention was paid to clarity of form and musical expression. It is the composer?s desire that each section or movement be perceived as a coherent unit with an individual musical identity. The commentary for the portfolio is divided into two parts. The first explores the theoretical framework behind the music. A number of different issues are addressed, the most prominent of which are the miniature format, the concept of experiential form and the notions of intuition and musical style. The second part of the commentary presents the individual compositions in a chronological order with a particular focus on compositional process, structure and form.

5|$|For {{the final}} {{destruction}} of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had to be carefully matched with ILM effects footage. ILM built scale <b>miniatures</b> cut into <b>sections</b> to portray parts of Genesis' upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate. One of the largest miniatures, measuring , had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane jets for gusts of fire, and solenoid-triggered rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton daubs on black), lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear Plexiglass with colored gels and covering the plate with methacyl, vermiculite and charcoal; the mixture dripped off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, {{with the help of}} a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lighting flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance. Because the shot was filmed on black instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or rotoscope the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time. The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as a bolt of lightning struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock beaming away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, as the level of destruction was simply not possible for the live action crew.|$|R
