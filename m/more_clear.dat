5|$|Under her leadership, Marine Le Pen {{has been}} <b>more</b> <b>clear</b> in her support for protectionism, while she has criticised globalism and {{capitalism}} for certain industries. She has been characterised as {{a proponent of}} letting the government take care of health, education, transportation, banking and energy.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{also gave}} credit to Elizabeth Sanders, Phipps' granddaughter and {{literary}} executor, for her skillful {{handling of the}} last two volumes. The purpose of the work becomes even more apparent and direct under her management and editing of the material. The role of the future marshals becomes <b>more</b> <b>clear</b> in the campaigns of 1797, and especially in the Italian campaign; her handling of the material kept it fully focused on the future marshals Massena, Augereau, Berthier, and Brune.|$|E
5|$|While {{some see}} {{speaking}} {{their native language}} as {{an important part of}} their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, interpretation and its cost has been criticised by some. A 2006 report by Alexander Stubb MEP highlighted that by only using English, French and German costs could be reduced from €118,000 per day (for 21 languages then—Romanian, Bulgarian and Croatian having not yet been included) to €8,900 per day. Some see the ideal single language as being English due to its widespread usage, although there has been a small-scale campaign to make French the reference language for all legal texts, {{due to the fact that}} it is <b>more</b> <b>clear</b> and precise for legal purposes.|$|E

50|$|A Clearing {{murder was}} a revenge {{killing of a}} known and popular Dane in {{the last part of}} the German {{occupation}} of Denmark during World War II. When a German or Danish soldier or informant was killed by the Danish resistance movement, the Peter group performed one or <b>more</b> <b>clearing</b> murder.|$|R
50|$|Dry-weather {{advanced}} landing {{fields were}} constructed {{by a single}} battalion at a favorable site in flat terrain in from one to three days, including time for reconnaissance. At less favorable sites, where <b>more</b> <b>clearing</b> and grading were required, or all-weather fields which also needed additional infrastructure, the time varied from three to ten days.|$|R
5|$|For much of Ernest's reign, {{the heir}} {{presumptive}} to Saxe-Coburg and Gotha {{was his only}} sibling Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria. When it became increasingly <b>more</b> <b>clear</b> that Ernest would be childless, {{the possibility of a}} personal union between his duchies and the United Kingdom became real, a reality that was deemed undesirable. Special arrangements were made by a combination of constitutional clauses and renunciations to pass Ernest's throne to a son of Albert while preventing a personal union. Consequently, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, his brother's second eldest son, was designated the childless Ernest's heir presumptive on 14 December 1861, when his older brother the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII of the United Kingdom) renounced his succession rights.|$|E

50|$|The {{situation}} in the West B PFG was much <b>more</b> <b>clearer.</b> Kom-Minyor left the competition during the winter break due financial difficulties, Botev (Krivodol) relegated after finishing on 11th place and Vihren (Sandanski) voluntarily left West B PFG {{after the end of}} the season. Those teams will be replaced with the V AFG champions - Slivnishki Geroi (Slivnitsa) (South-West) and Bdin (Vidin) (North-West).|$|R
25|$|Traditionally, the {{movement}} of groundwater has been studied separately from surface water, climatology, and even the chemical and microbiological aspects of hydrogeology (the processes are uncoupled). As the field of hydrogeology matures, the strong interactions between groundwater, surface water, water chemistry, soil moisture and even climate are becoming <b>more</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E
25|$|Geny Lopez died {{of cancer}} on June 29, 1999, in the United States.

25|$|The {{election}} of 2006 {{was a call}} to change– not merely to change the control of Congress, but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people <b>more</b> <b>clear</b> {{about the need for}} a new direction than in Iraq. The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.|$|E
25|$|Although Stoke Newington {{contains}} only one Grade I listed building (St Matthias Church), {{it contains a}} fair number of Grade II* buildings for one London district.

25|$|Early Church Fathers {{advocated}} against polygamy, abortion, infanticide, child abuse, homosexuality, transvestism, and incest. Although some Christian ideals {{were adopted}} by the Roman Empire, {{there is little evidence}} to link most of these laws to Church influence. After the Roman Empire adopted Christianity as the official religion, however, the link between Christian teachings and Roman family laws became <b>more</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 15 August 2016, President Obama {{transferred}} another 15 prisoners {{from the}} prison. This {{was the largest}} single day transfer since President Obama took office in 2009. The inmates, 12 Yemeni nationals and 3 Afghans, were transferred to the United Arab Emirates. This brought {{the total number of}} prisoners down to 61 with 20 <b>more</b> <b>cleared</b> for transfer. President Obama reiterated that one of his goals before leaving office is to close the prison.|$|R

25|$|SPS {{was first}} {{described}} in 1956. Diagnostic criteria were {{proposed in the}} 1960s and refined two decades later. In the 1990s and 2000s the roles of antibodies in the condition became <b>more</b> <b>clear.</b> SPS patients generally have GAD antibodies, which seldom occur in the general population. In addition to blood to tests for GAD, electromyography tests can help confirm the condition's presence.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} {{injective}} {{object in the}} category of abelian groups was studied somewhat independently of injective modules under the term divisible group. Here a Z-module M is injective if and only if n⋅M = M for every nonzero integer n. Here the relationships between flat modules, pure submodules, and injective modules is <b>more</b> <b>clear,</b> as it simply refers to certain divisibility properties of module elements by integers.|$|E
25|$|With his {{football}} career almost over, Townsend was recalled to the South Australian cricket team in 1918/19, after an eleven-year gap between appearances. He had previously, in 1907/08, played a Sheffield Shield match, where he didn't bowl yet batted {{far down the}} order at nine. His role this time was <b>more</b> <b>clear</b> and in his return match, against Victoria, he took 5-27 in their second innings and opening the batting in the first.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to his work, Florinus compiled a Latin-Swedish-Finnish dictionary Nomenclatura rerum brevissima latino-sveco-finnonica. In his writing, Florinus probably used Swedish texts as an aid, to which Finnish words had been added. The dictionary was published in 1678. Having a good command of Finnish, Florinus made his dictionary much <b>more</b> <b>clearer</b> than its predecessor and also came up with new words. The dictionary was reprinted in 1695 and later a third printing which included German vocabulary.|$|R
50|$|Like most of Seattle, the Cascade Neighborhood was {{originally}} heavily forested. In the 1860s, David Denny and Thomas Mercer first claimed portions of this land. However, initial development {{was a bit}} west of Cascade, at southwest Lake Union, which became a transportation nexus and where Denny established the lake's first sawmill. By the 1880s, more mills and <b>more</b> <b>cleared</b> land led to the origin of Cascade as a residential and industrial neighborhood, tied into water transportation.|$|R

In our proposed design, the optimized power allocated to the pilot symbols is not uniformly distributed, which suggests that {{in the presence of}} null subcarriers, equi-powered pilot symbols may not necessarily be optimal. This may not be well encapsulated in the total channel estimate MSE, but is <b>more</b> <b>clearer</b> when considering the channel estimate in each subcarrier.|$|R
25|$|As {{the threat}} of war in Europe became ever <b>more</b> <b>clear</b> the {{decision}} was made to improve the Royal Norwegian Navy's mine warfare capabilities. At first a number of 2. class gunboats were rebuilt into minelayers and minesweepers, but with war looming it soon became clear that more capable vessels were required. Thus, two new purpose-built minesweepers were constructed at Nylands Verksted in Oslo; Otra and Rauma. Both ships were completed and commissioned only a short time before the German invasion of Norway. Otra class vessels used the Oropesa system of minesweeping.|$|E
25|$|Many {{hospitals}} use the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA) protocol {{in order}} to assess the level of withdrawal present and therefore the amount of medication needed. When overuse of alcohol is suspected but drinking history is unclear, testing for elevated values of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin or gammaglutamyl transferase can help make the diagnosis of alcohol overuse and dependence <b>more</b> <b>clear.</b> The CIWA has also been shortened (now called the CIWA-Ar), while retaining its validity and reliability, to help assess patients more efficiently due to the life-threatening nature of alcohol withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} other poets {{belonging}} {{to one or}} the other of two major schools of the Late Tang. in one school were Luo Yin (羅隱/罗隐, 833-909), Nie—or Zhe or She or Ye—Yizhong (聶夷中/聂夷中, 887-884), Du Xunhe (杜荀鹤), Pi Rixiu (皮日休, approximately 834/840—883), Lu Guimeng (陸龜蒙/陆龟蒙 ?-881), and others. In the other group, were Wei Zhuang (韦庄, 836-910), Sikong Tu (司空圖, 837-908), Zheng Gu (鄭谷, 849-911), Han Wo (844-?), and others. During the final twilight of Tang, both schools were prone to a melancholic angst; they varied by whether they tended towards metaphor and allusiveness or a <b>more</b> <b>clear</b> and direct expression.|$|E

However, details in dark regions in enhanced image with the proposed method (Figs.  9 c and 10 c) are <b>more</b> <b>clearer</b> than that with the bright channel prior-based method [21] (Fig.  9 b) and negative imaging dark channel-based method [20] (Fig.  10 b).|$|R
