However, given the increasingly competitive online auction market, Margaret C. Whitman, the CEO of eBay, knew that the battle ahead would not be easy. As she retraced the events that happened in the last six months, she pondered eBay's strategy to manage both the external competitive situation and the internal hypergrowth of the company. Several issues were troubling Whitman. eBay had always focused on the person-to-person auction market. But given the recent hype about the growth prospects in the business-to-consumer (B 2 C) and business-to-business (B 2 B) markets, was eBay missing out on these opportunities? Besides, this year the company started pursuing a regional and international expansion strategy as well as an off-line strategy by purchasing two auction houses. Even if eBay did enter the new markets, would it be spreading itself too thin? How could it integrate these different ideas without losing focus on the core business? eBay's revenue model was another concern. Some competitors were relying on their retail revenue and offering auction services fo...|$|E
