40|$|The growing {{global demand}} for seafood {{together}} with the limited capacity of the wild-capture sector to meet this demand has seen the aquaculture industry continue to grow around the world. A vast array of aquatic animal species is farmed in high density in freshwater, brackish and marine systems where {{they are exposed to}} new environments and potentially new diseases. On-farm stresses may compromise their ability to combat infection, and farming practices facilitate rapid transmission of disease. <b>Viral</b> <b>pathogens,</b> whether they have been established for decades or whether they are newly emerging as disease threats, are particularly challenging since there are few, if any, efficacious treatments, and the development of effective viral vaccines for delivery in aquatic systems remains elusive.

40|$|Background: Although {{cytomegalovirus}} (CMV) is {{an uncommon}} cause of viral hepatitis during pregnancy, a definitive diagnosis {{is important because}} of the potential for congenital CMV. In the case reported here, a diagnosis of hepatitis caused by CMV was made after the <b>more</b> common <b>viral</b> <b>pathogens</b> had been ruled out. Case: A 17 -year-old, 12 -week pregnant patient was evaluated for fever and right upper quadrant tenderness. A serologic evaluation revealed elevated liver function levels and a positive maternal serology for CMV IgM. A diagnosis of hepatitis caused by CMV was made after the <b>more</b> common <b>viral</b> <b>pathogens</b> and drug-induced hepatitis had been ruled out.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Modern {{molecular}} techniques reveal new {{information on the}} role of respiratory viruses in community-acquired pneumonia. In this study, we tried to determine the prevalence of respiratory viruses and bacteria in patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were admitted to the hospital. METHODS: Between April 2008 and April 2009, 408 adult patients (aged between 20 and 94 years) with community-acquired pneumonia were tested for the presence of respiratory pathogens using bacterial cultures, real-time PCR for viruses and bacteria, urinary antigen testing for Legionella and Pneumococci and serology for the presence of <b>viral</b> and bacterial <b>pathogens.</b> RESULTS: Pathogens were identified in 263 (64 · 5 %) of the 408 patients. The most common single organisms in these 263 patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae (22 · 8 %), Coxiella burnetii (6 · 8 %) and influenza A virus (3 · 8 %). Of the 263 patients detected with pathogens, 117 (44 · 5 %) patients were positive for one or <b>more</b> <b>viral</b> <b>pathogens.</b> Of these 117 patients, 52 (44 · 4 %) had no bacterial pathogen. Multiple virus infections (≥ 2) were found in 16 patients.

40|$|Abstract Background It {{is known}} that {{crustaceans}} and insects can persistently carry one or <b>more</b> <b>viral</b> <b>pathogens</b> at low levels, without signs of disease. They may transmit them to their offspring or to naïve individuals, often with lethal consequences. The underlying molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated, but {{the process has been}} called viral accommodation. Since tolerance to one virus does not confer tolerance to another, tolerance is pathogen-specific, so the requirement for a specific pathogen response mechanism (memory) was included in the original viral accommodation concept. Later, it was hypothesized that specific responses were based on the presence of viruses in persistent infections. However, recent developments suggest that specific responses may be based on viral sequences inserted into the host genome. Presentation of the hypothesis Non-retroviral fragments of both RNA and DNA viruses have been found in insect and crustacean genomes. In addition, reverse-transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) sequences are also common in their genomes. It is hypothesized that shrimp and other arthropods use these RT to recognize "foreign" mRNA of both RNA and DNA viruses and use the integrases (IN) to randomly insert short cDNA sequences into their genomes. By chance, some of these sequences result in production of immunospecific RNA (imRNA) capable of stimulating RNAi that suppresses viral propagation. Individuals with protective inserts would pass these on to the next generation, together with similar protective inserts for other viruses that could be amalgamated rapidly in individual offspring by random assortment of chromosomes. The most successful individuals would be environmentally selected from billions of offspring. Conclusion This hypothesis for immunity based on an imRNA generation mechanism fits with the general principle of invertebrate immunity based on a non-host, "pattern recognition" process. If proven correct, understanding the process would allow directed preparation of vaccines for selection of crustacean and insect lines applicable in commercial production species (e. g., shrimp and bees) or in control of insect-borne diseases. Arising from a natural host mechanism, the resulting animals would not be artificially, genetically modified (GMO). Reviewers This article was reviewed by Akria Shibuya, Eugene V. Koonin and L.

40|$|Many {{wastewater}} treatment technologies {{have been shown}} to remove bacterial <b>pathogens</b> <b>more</b> effectively than <b>viral</b> <b>pathogens</b> and, in aquatic environments, levels of traditional faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) do not appear to correlate consistently with levels of human <b>viral</b> <b>pathogens.</b> There is, therefore, a need for novel viral indicators of faecal pollution and surrogates of <b>viral</b> <b>pathogens,</b> especially given the increasing importance of indirect and direct wastewater reuse. Potential candidates include bacteriophages (phages) and the study described here sought to elucidate the relationship between three groups of phages (somatic coliphages (SOMPH), F RNA coliphages (F RNAPH) and human-specific phages infecting B. fragilis (Bf 124 PH) – enumeration using double layer agar technique) and <b>viral</b> <b>pathogens</b> (human adenovirus (HuAdV) and norovirus (NoV) – enumeration using molecular methods) through full-scale municipal {{wastewater treatment}} processes. FIB (faecal coliforms (FC) and intestinal enterococci (ENT) – enumeration using membrane filtration) were also monitored. Samples were collected every fortnight, during a twelve-month period, at each stage of four full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in southern England (two activated sludge (AS) and two trickling filter (TF) plants) (n= 360 samples). FIB and SOMPH were consistently found in all samples tested, whereas F RNAPH, Bf 124 PH and HuAdV were less frequently detected, especially following AS treatment. The detection rate of NoV was low and consequently discussion of this group of viruses is limited. Concentrations of SOMPH and FIB were statistically higher (p value< 0. 05) than concentrations of F RNAPH, Bf 124 PH and HuAdV in raw wastewater. FIB were more effectively removed than phages in both systems. Removal rates of HuAdV were similar to those of phages at the secondary treatment stage of both systems. In TF systems, HuAdV were removed {{at the same rate as}} F-RNAPH, but at lower rates than SOMPH and Bf 124 PH. The findings suggest that phages (in particular SOMPH) are better indicators of the fate of <b>viral</b> <b>pathogens</b> in WWTP than existing FIB and that these organisms may have a useful role to play in future sanitation safety planning...|$|R

After our study, the majority of microbes detected were RNA viruses (89. 9 %). Overall, human rhinoviruses (HRVs) were the most frequently identified target (n= 140) followed by human adenoviruses (HAdVs; n = 25), human metapneumovirus (HMPV; n= 18), human bocavirus (HBoV; n = 15), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV; n = 12), human coronaviruses (HCoVs; n = 11), and human herpesvirus- 6 (n = 11). HRVs were the sole microbe detected in 37. 8 % (n = 31) of patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Genotyping of the HRV VP 4 /VP 2 region resulted in a proposed subdivision of HRV type A into sublineages A 1 and A 2. Most of the genotyped HAdV strains were found to be type C.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 As obligate parasites, <b>viral</b> <b>pathogens</b> coopt host {{resources}} and subvert cellular processes {{to promote their}} own replication. In response, host organisms have evolved numerous countermeasures to thwart viral infection.

This evolution-guided approach identified and allowed the characterization of multiple surfaces on MxA that function as independent modules to define target recognition and antiviral specificity.
