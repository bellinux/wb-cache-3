5|$|Though {{often used}} interchangeably, in biology these words have {{different}} meanings. Fish {{is used as}} a singular noun, or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from a single species. Fishes is used to describe different species or species groups. Thus a pond that contained a single species <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to contain 120 fish. But if the pond contained a total of 120 fish from three different species, it would be said to contain three fishes. The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples.|$|E

25|$|In his {{character}} General McCreery was modest {{to the point}} of shyness. He was not comfortable in public speaking, but as Doherty puts it: 'Not a self-publicist in the manner of Montgomery, McCreery managed nonetheless to gain the confidence of his soldiers who trusted him in peace and war.' An overriding sense of duty <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to have characterised his life and career.|$|E
25|$|At Swim-Two-Birds {{was one of}} {{the last}} books that James Joyce read and he praised it to O'Nolan's friends—praise which was {{subsequently}} used for years as a blurb on reprints of O'Brien's novels.

25|$|Some philosophers, such as Sartre, {{believe in}} an epistemic {{loneliness}} in which loneliness {{is a fundamental}} {{part of the human}} condition because of the paradox between people's consciousness desiring meaning in life and the isolation and nothingness of the universe. Conversely, other existentialist thinkers argue that human beings <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to actively engage each other and the universe as they communicate and create, and loneliness is merely the feeling of being cut off from this process.|$|E

By the end of 2006, Connecticut and New Jersey had also enacted civil union laws; New Hampshire followed in 2007. Furthermore, California's domestic partnership law had been expanded {{to the point that it}} became practically a civil union law, as well.

25|$|Relativity and {{ambiguity}} {{are prominent}} {{ideas in the}} play, and the audience is challenged to come to conclusions about the ambivalent nature {{of many of the}} characters. The relationship between Antony and Cleopatra can easily be read as one of love or lust; their passion can be construed as being wholly destructive but also showing elements of transcendence. Cleopatra <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to kill herself out of love for Antony, or because she has lost political power. Octavius can be seen as either a noble and good ruler, only wanting what is right for Rome, or as a cruel and ruthless politician.|$|E

25|$|Akha {{religion}} — zahv — {{is often}} described as a mixture of animism and ancestor worship that emphasizes the Akha connection with the land and their place in the natural world and cycles. Although Akha beliefs and rituals involve all of these elements, the Akha often reject the casual categorization of their practices as such saying it simplifies and reduces its meaning. The Akha way emphasizes rituals in everyday life and stresses strong family ties. Akha ethnicity is closely tied to the Akha religion. It <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that to be considered an Akha ethnically by other Akhas is to practice the Akha religion.|$|E

500|$|In 1864, Wallace {{published}} a paper, [...] "The Origin of Human Races and the Antiquity of Man Deduced from the Theory of 'Natural Selection'", applying the theory to humankind. Darwin {{had not yet}} publicly addressed the subject, although Thomas Huxley had in Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. He explained the apparent stability of the human stock by pointing to the vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and the great apes. Unlike some other Darwinists, including Darwin himself, he did not [...] "regard modern primitives as almost filling the gap between man and ape". He saw the evolution of humans in two stages: achieving a bipedal posture freeing the hands {{to carry out the}} dictates of the brain, and the [...] "recognition of the human brain as a totally new factor in the history of life. Wallace was apparently the first evolutionist to recognize clearly that... with the emergence of that bodily specialization which constitutes the human brain, bodily specialization itself <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to be outmoded."

500|$|Monotype Bembo {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous revivals of the Aldine {{typeface}} of 1495. It was created under the influence of Monotype executive and printing historian Stanley Morison by the design team at the Monotype factory in Salfords, Surrey, south of London. While most printers of the Arts and Crafts movement of the previous sixty years had been more interested in the slightly earlier typefaces of Nicolas Jenson, Morison greatly admired Aldus Manutius' typeface above others of the period. The main reasons for his admiration were the balance of the letter construction, such as the evenness of the 'e' with a level cross-stroke and the way the capitals were made slightly lower than the ascenders of the tallest lower-case letters. He described the Aldine roman as [...] "inspired not by writing, but by engraving; not script but sculpture." [...] His friend printer Giovanni Mardersteig similarly suggested the appeal of the Aldine face in his commentary that [...] "Griffo...rid himself of the influence of the characteristic round forms of letters written with a pen; he developed instead a more narrow and it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> a more modern form, which was better suited to ...whereas Jenson's style made a strong appeal to the sense of beauty prevalent in the period of Art Nouveau, today our taste in architecture and typography inclines towards simpler and more disciplined forms." ...|$|E
500|$|The Imperial army, {{although}} smaller, was {{not much}} better, and certainly not the battle-hardened army the Prussians had faced at Kolin. This was the Reichsarmee, an army consisting of units sent by the constituent members of the Holy Roman Empire. [...] Their commander had {{reported that they were}} defective in training, administration, armaments, discipline and leadership. The same <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of their commander, Saxe-Hildburghausen, an indolent and slow-moving man. The Imperial regimental officers often lacked even basic garrison training. [...] These units had little experience working together, much less fighting together, a problem that expressed itself most evidently in the disastrous wheeling pivot. Furthermore, the Reichsarmee contingents came from many principalities, some of which were Protestant, and many of which were unhappy about any alliance with the French; most were more adverse to the French than they were to the Prussians. Once news of the battle's uneven resolution spread, some Germans felt satisfaction; the battle could be seen as retribution for the years of suffering under the French atrocities in the Rhineland and Palatinate during the Palatinate campaign and the subsequent invasions and occupation of Louis XIV. Mostly, though, Rossbach was significant for the strengthening of Prussia's relationship with Frederick's uncle, King George, and George's other subjects. The British could now see the advantage of keeping the French occupied on the Continent while they continued their expansion in North America.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} low- and modestly-budgeted noirs {{were made by}} independent, often actor-owned, {{companies}} contracting with larger studios for distribution. Serving as producer, writer, director and top-billed performer, Hugo Haas made films like Pickup (1951) and The Other Woman (1954). It was in this way that accomplished noir actress Ida Lupino established herself as the sole female director in Hollywood during the late 1940s {{and much of the}} 1950s. She does not appear in the best-known film she directed, The Hitch-Hiker (1953), developed by her company, The Filmakers, with support and distribution by RKO. It is one of the seven classic film noirs produced largely outside of the major studios that have been chosen for the United States National Film Registry. Of the others, one was a small-studio release: [...] Detour. Four were independent productions distributed by United Artists, the [...] "studio without a studio": Gun Crazy; Kiss Me Deadly; D.O.A. (1950), directed by Rudolph Maté and Sweet Smell of Success (1957), directed by Alexander Mackendrick. One was an independent distributed by MGM, the industry leader: Force of Evil (1948), directed by Abraham Polonsky and starring John Garfield, both of whom were blacklisted in the 1950s. Independent production usually meant restricted circumstances but Sweet Smell of Success, despite the plans of the production team, was clearly not made on the cheap, though like many other cherished A-budget noirs, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to have a B-movie soul.|$|E

500|$|The Minister may {{declare that}} any foreign {{broadcasting}} service which is rebroadcast in Singapore has been [...] "engaging {{in the domestic}} politics of Singapore". Rebroadcasting such a [...] "declared foreign broadcasting service" [...] is prohibited without the Minister's approval, which can be refused, revoked without reasons, or granted on conditions, which may include restrictions {{on the number of}} people permitted to receive the service and suspensions of the service for certain periods. Failing to comply with the above rules is a crime punishable by a fine of up to $100,000. Similar provisions exist in the NPPA to enable the circulation of foreign newspapers in Singapore to be restricted. In February 1987, the Asian Wall Street Journal was declared to have engaged in domestic politics and its circulation was limited to 400 copies. The newspaper's publisher, Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia) Inc., applied unsuccessfully to the High Court for certiorari to quash the Minister's orders. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, Dow Jones argued that the Minister had acted irrationally and misinterpreted scope of his powers under the NPPA by not considering the right to free speech protected by Article 14(1)(a). The Court dismissed the argument on the ground that Dow Jones could not rely on the Article as it only applied to Singapore citizens. Furthermore, even if Dow Jones could raise the constitutionality of the relevant provisions of the NPPA on the basis that Singapore citizens were indirectly affected by it, it was not evident that the right to free speech included the right to receive information. In any case, even if the latter argument was accepted, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that the right of Singapore citizens to receive information by reading the Asian Wall Street Journal had not been impaired since 400 copies of it were still in circulation. The Court interpreted the term domestic politics broadly, holding that in Singapore's context it included: ...|$|E
