5|$|Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace (1975) applied {{rational}} expectations to models with Phillips curve trade-offs between inflation and output {{and found that}} <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> {{could not be used}} to systematically stabilize the economy. Sargent and Wallace's policy ineffectiveness proposition found that economic agents would anticipate inflation and adjust to higher price levels before the influx of monetary stimulus could boost employment and output. Only unanticipated <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> could increase employment, and no central bank could systematically use <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> for expansion without economic agents catching on and anticipating price changes before they could have a stimulative impact.|$|E

5|$|Anna Schwartz {{collaborated with}} Friedman to produce one of monetarism's major works, A Monetary History of the United States (1963), which linked money {{supply to the}} {{business}} cycle. The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted the view that <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, interest rates had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians only looked at nominal rates and neglected the role inflation plays in real interest rates, which had been high {{during much of the}} Depression. In real terms, <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> had effectively been contractionary, putting downward pressure on output and employment, even though economists looking only at nominal rates thought <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> had been stimulative.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we perform a {{meta-analysis}} {{of the effects}} of <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> on output and prices. We use a sample of published papers on the effects of <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> in different countries. There is a large variation in the estimated effects of <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> on output and prices. We find that the use of different econometric methodologies is an important variable explaining these differences. In addition, we analyze the importance of macroeconomic variables. Thus we find that in countries with high inflation, the output effects of <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> are significantly reduced. A lot of variation in the estimated effects of <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> remains unexplained. More research will have to be done to understand these large differences. ...|$|R

5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> could have an impact in a model with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies how {{an aging}} {{population}} affects economic performance {{and the effectiveness of}} fiscal and <b>monetary</b> <b>policies.</b> We develop a New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous households, workers, and retirees. We demonstrate that an increase in the proportion of working population increases aggregate output, consumption, and investment by increasing total labor supply in the long run. It also increases wages and reduces social security burden of the government. This paper also finds that effectiveness of fiscal and <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> is weakened when the proportion of retirees becomes larger. This is the reason why recent <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> cannot recover the Japanese economy from the prolonged stagnation...|$|R
