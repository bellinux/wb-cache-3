So far, the analytical modeling of such instruments has enabled to treat ionospheric plasmas, where charged particles are usually well characterized by Maxwellian electron distributions. With the growth of planetary exploration, <b>mutual</b> <b>impedance</b> experiments are or will be used to constrain space plasma bulk properties. Space plasmas are usually out of local thermodynamic equilibrium; therefore, new methods to calibrate and analyze <b>mutual</b> <b>impedance</b> experiments are now required in such non-Maxwellian plasmas.

The <b>mutual</b> <b>impedance</b> formulas are given for four geometries: a fullspace, a cylinder in a fullspace, a halfspace, and a layer over a halfspace. IP effects are characterized by a Cole-Cole model, the properties of which are fully investigated. From the general <b>mutual</b> <b>impedance</b> formulas specific limiting forms are defined to characterize the IP and EM effects.
