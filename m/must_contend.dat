5|$|Set in the 23rd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) and {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise. In this episode, Kirk and the Enterprise <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> with pirates who have stolen a load of cargo that includes medicine crucial to save a dying Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy).|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} patient, {{the partner}} of an injured person {{frequently}} needs support and counseling. It can help with adjustment to a new relationship dynamic and self-image (such as being placed {{in the role of}} caretaker) or with stresses that arise in the sexual relationship. Frequently, partners of injured people <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> with feelings like guilt, anger, anxiety, and exhaustion while dealing with the added financial burden of lost wages and medical expenses. Counseling aims to strengthen the relationship by improving communication and trust.|$|E
5|$|Mallards of {{all ages}} (but {{especially}} young ones) and in all locations <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> with a wide diversity of predators including raptors, mustelids, corvids, snakes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, turtles, large fish, felids, and canids, including domesticated ones. The most prolific natural predators of adult mallards are red foxes (which most often pick off brooding females) and the faster or larger birds of prey, i.e. peregrine falcons, Aquila eagles, or Haliaeetus eagles. In North America, adult mallards face no fewer than 15 species of birds of prey, from northern harriers and short-eared owls (both smaller than a mallard) to huge bald and golden eagles, and about a dozen species of mammalian predator, not counting several more avian and mammalian predators who threaten eggs and nestlings.|$|E
50|$|Not only <b>must</b> Luc <b>contend</b> with ambitious {{reporter}} Erin Young (Heidi Schanz), {{who will}} not leave his side, but he <b>must</b> also <b>contend</b> with General Radford (Daniel von Bargen) who wants to take extreme measures to stop S.E.T.H.. S.E.T.H. has arranged Romeo to kidnap Luc's injured 13-year-old daughter Hillary (Karis Paige Bryant), killing Maggie in the process.|$|R

5|$|The team finds {{another version}} of themselves, dead, who come from yet another {{parallel}} universe and were trapped aboard while investigating the ship, just as they are. Soon, the ship jumps again, into a reality where Atlantis is under attack from an unfamiliar alien ship. Sheppard intervenes, and the aliens retaliate by launching fighters. One of the fighters crashes into the Daedalus before it jumps again, this time into a universe where Atlantis' sun has already swelled into a red giant. To keep the ship from being burned up, McKay (David Hewlett) increases {{the rate at which}} the alternate reality drive activates, warning that his modifications are irreversible. Meanwhile, the team <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> with aliens from the crashed fighter. McKay figures out that there is no way to guide the alternate reality drive, but that they can return to their original reality by reversing the drive and jumping back through the realities they had visited before. They use the maneuvering thrusters to stabilize the ship's orbit above the red giant, and weather another attack by the aliens, with help from an alternate Atlantis. Once they return to their own reality, they leave the ship in space suits after a remaining alien detonates an explosive, causing a breach in the ship's hull and are picked up by Lorne (Kavan Smith) after the Daedalus disappears. In the end, McKay is shown working on fixing the alternate reality drive, despite Sheppard's admonishments.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} other {{interchangeable}} lens designs, DSLRs <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> with potential {{contamination of the}} sensor by dust particles when the lens is changed (though recent dust reduction systems alleviate this). Digital cameras with fixed lenses are not usually subject to dust from outside the camera settling on the sensor.|$|E
25|$|Some {{officials}} {{have criticized the}} claim that the strong test scores prove Israel is a highly educated country, pointing out that scores from standardized tests exclude haredi and special education students, and thus are not an accurate reflection. Israeli teachers <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> with large classes, low wages and low morale.|$|E
5000|$|Fans {{and journalists}} alike testify {{unanimously}} to the album's filthy content. A listener's ambivalence to Martling's dirty jokes <b>must</b> inevitably <b>contend</b> with, and make allowances for, {{a world that}} is not perfect, as one review explains: ...|$|R
50|$|Accesses to I/O {{are also}} contended if the ULA <b>must</b> read <b>contended</b> memory while the Z80 must access a ULA I/O port. ULA I/O ports are {{those with an}} even address (address bit 0 is a 0).|$|R
50|$|Luc <b>must</b> also <b>contend</b> {{with the}} ambitious {{reporter}} Erin Young, and General Radford, {{who wants to}} take extreme measures to stop SETH. SETH gets Romeo to find Luc's 13-year-old daughter Hillary and kidnaps her, killing Maggie in the process.|$|R
25|$|Poor {{sanitation}} {{is perhaps}} the South Province's greatest health hazard. Many villages {{have no access to}} running water, and even areas that do have it <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> with outbreaks of amoebic dysentery, bacterial dysentery, brucellosis, giardia, hepatitis A, and schistosomiasis. In 2004, the relatively developed town of Kribi suffered a major cholera epidemic.|$|E
25|$|Devon Neff: A rookie driver {{on the ice}} roads {{who works}} for Mullen, Neff is called in to help move {{equipment}} off the Langley site late in the season. Due to the poor condition of the road at this time, he <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> with hazards such as breaks in the surface and water overflows from beneath the ice.|$|E
25|$|Poor inner-city {{residents}} also <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> {{with other}} factors that negatively affect health. Research has proven that in every major American city, hypersegregated blacks {{are far more likely}} to be exposed to dangerous levels of air toxins. Daily exposure to this polluted air means that African-Americans living in these areas are at greater risk of disease.|$|E
50|$|The further {{adventures of}} U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn are told here. He battles criminals and {{injustice}} {{in his own}} unorthodox way. Meanwhile, he <b>must</b> also <b>contend</b> with the ever tough-as-nails Mattie Ross, a teenage girl hellbent on reforming him.|$|R
50|$|In this {{entry in}} the long-running Madame Aema series, Aema's husband becomes romantically {{involved}} with a Japanese woman after taking {{a job at a}} Japanese company. Aema <b>must</b> also <b>contend</b> with two men who are making romantic advances towards her.|$|R
50|$|Historians <b>must</b> {{occasionally}} <b>contend</b> with forged {{documents that}} purport to be primary sources. These forgeries have usually been constructed with a fraudulent purpose, such as promulgating legal rights, supporting false pedigrees, or promoting particular interpretations of historic events. The investigation of documents {{to determine their}} authenticity is called diplomatics.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} game, , Phoenix <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> {{with the loss}} of his mentor and fellow defense {{attorney}} Mia Fey. Throughout the game, Phoenix is hired to defend various people of murder, including his friend Larry Butz and Mia's younger sister Maya Fey. The game culminates with Phoenix defending rival prosecutor Miles Edgeworth from conviction for the murder of Robert Hammond, an old defense attorney.|$|E
25|$|Wright is the {{inspiration}} for the character Algernon Edwards, played by actor Andre Holland, in the Cinemax television drama series The Knick. Edwards, like Wright, graduated {{at the top of his}} class at Harvard Medical School and serves as the first African-American surgeon at the fictionalized Knickerbocker Hospital in Manhattan. Whereas the Harlem Hospital consisted a previously all-white surgical staff serving primarily African-American patients, the hospital in The Knick is an all-white surgical staff serving primarily white patients. While Edwards, active two decades prior to Wright, was not involved in broad-scale civil rights activism, the racial injustice he and others <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> with is a major theme of the show.|$|E
25|$|TSMC and {{the rest}} of the foundry {{industry}} are exposed to the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. During upturns, TSMC must ensure that it has enough production capacity to meet strong customer demand. However, during downturns, it <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> with excess capacity because of weaker demand, and the high fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities. As a result, the company's financial results tend to fluctuate with a cycle time of a few years. This is more apparent in earnings than revenues because of the general trend of revenue and capacity growth. TSMC's business has generally also been seasonal with a peak in Q3 and a low in Q1.|$|E
5000|$|Superman {{serves as}} the main DC mascot. He often feels {{forgotten}} due to the range of new superhero films. All the X-Men - especially Wolverine - hate him because, in Superman Returns, he stole their director (Bryan Singer) and <b>must</b> be <b>contended</b> for the [...] "Rush Hour guy" [...] (Brett Ratner).|$|R

25|$|A third {{example is}} the {{determination}} of the salary for work performed. Whether we reckon using the Stelo system or not, wages are a matter of daily concern. All industrialized countries <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> with inflation, which continuously gnaws away at the family budget, and the only remedy is the continuing increase of salaries. Especially in the industrialized world, wage negotiations can lead to sometimes bitter confrontation between employers and labour unions. In developing countries lacking a strong tradition of labour relations law, these confrontations can result in human rights abuses or even in police or military intervention. After a strike or lockout has concluded it may {{take a long time to}} regain an atmosphere of mutual confidence and trust. Esperantist economists believe that the application of the Stelo to labour-management negotiations could prevent these problems.|$|E
25|$|The {{asymmetric}} hydrogenation of aromatic (especially heteroaromatic), substrates is a {{very active}} field of ongoing research. Catalysts in this field <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> {{with a number of}} complicating factors, including the tendency of highly stable aromatic compounds to resist hydrogenation, the potential coordinating (and therefore catalyst-poisoning) abilities of both substrate and product, and the great diversity in substitution patterns that may be present on any one aromatic ring. Of these substrates the most consistent success has been seen with nitrogen-containing heterocycles, where the aromatic ring is often activated either by protonation or by further functionalization of the nitrogen (generally with an electron-withdrawing protecting group). Such strategies are less applicable to oxygen- and sulfur-containing heterocycles, since they are both less basic and less nucleophilic; this additional difficulty may help to explain why few effective methods exist for their asymmetric hydrogenation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the work being conducted by the Australian Centre for Field Robotics (ACFR) and the CRC for Mining Technology and Equipment (CMTE) into sensors and systems for real-time environment imaging. Radar is perhaps the only sensor capable of performing imaging tasks in environments where high levels of dust, water vapour, and rain <b>must</b> be <b>contended</b> with. Methods of visualising the radar data for various applications are presented. ...|$|R
5000|$|Not only must web archivists {{deal with}} the {{technical}} challenges of web archiving, they <b>must</b> also <b>contend</b> with intellectual property laws. Peter Lyman states that [...] "although the Web is popularly regarded as a public domain resource, it is copyrighted; thus, archivists have no legal right to copy the Web". However national libraries in some countries [...] have a legal right to copy portions of the web under an extension of a legal deposit.|$|R
500|$|Crown Duel {{deviates}} {{from the}} typical rebellion story by treating its success as another {{problem to be}} dealt with. Comparing this to the George Orwell story Animal Farm, Leigh Kimmel wrote that by defeating [...] "the wicked king at midpoint, the second half involv court intrigues of the provisional government as the next king is decided upon," [...] thus increasing the challenges for the protagonist. Rather than face armies and weapons, Mel <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> with a court where [...] "war is just as intense and bewildering as on the battlefield--except swords have been traded for fans and armor discarded for elaborate dresses." ...|$|E
500|$|Each {{season of}} The Wire {{introduces}} a different {{institution in the}} city of Baltimore and its relationship to law enforcement, while retaining characters and advancing storylines from previous seasons. The five subjects are, in chronological order: the illegal drug trade, the seaport system, the city government and bureaucracy, education and schools, and the print news media. The large cast consists mainly of actors who are little known for their other roles, as well as numerous real-life Baltimore and Maryland figures in guest and recurring roles. Simon has said that despite its framing as a crime drama, the show is [...] "really about the American city, and about how we live together. It's about how institutions have an effect on individuals. Whether one is a cop, a longshoreman, a drug dealer, a politician, a judge or a lawyer, all are ultimately compromised and <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> with whatever institution to which they are committed." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{gardens and}} menagerie area {{includes}} {{an encounter with}} a [...] "cute little bunnyoid on the stump". It looks like a horned rabbit on a tree stump, but when approached, the stump develops fangs and its roots become tentacles, which it then uses to attack the characters. The next encounter involves a froghemoth, a large alien frog-like creature with tentacles and three eyes on an eyestalk. In the sixth and final section, the activity deck, the players' characters <b>must</b> <b>contend</b> with various sports robots, including a [...] "boxing and wrestling trainer" [...] and a [...] "karate master". If the characters can communicate with the karate master and tell it that boxing is superior to karate, it will attack the boxing robot until both are destroyed, else they will both attack the characters. The last area of the activity deck is the loading area, where the characters can leave the spaceship. The adventure then ends, with no postscript.|$|E
40|$|Stockpilers of {{commodities}} {{in short supply}} <b>must</b> frequently <b>contend</b> with game-theoretic ramifications arising {{from the fact that}} unit purchasing cost increases with aggregate requirements. In this paper, a competitive inventory procurement model for countries facing uncertain demand is analyzed as a game of strategy. Noncooperative and cooperative aspects of the problem are examined. There are significant incentives for cooperating. Some implications of this analysis for strategic petroleum stockpiling models are discussed. inventory, stockpiling models, games/group decisions...|$|R

40|$|As North Carolina's coastal {{communities}} face challenges {{in maintaining the}} quality of the natural and cultural resources that drive their tourism economy the need for sustainable actions in tourism development is made apparent. Should tourism planners chart a new course in tourism development, one that includes sustainable actions, stakeholders who will affect or will be affected by the change must be consulted. Residents are critical stakeholders in the tourism development process, as they <b>must</b> regularly <b>contend</b> with the impacts of tourism. There are many second homeowners in the communities examined in this study who <b>must</b> also <b>contend</b> with change that tourism creates. Therefore property owners, both permanent residents and second homeowners, were examined to determine if there are groups of property owners who hold different attitudes toward sustainable actions in tourism development. A sociodemographic profile for each group was created to help planners identify the group's members. By understanding the varying attitudes towards sustainable actions in tourism development and being able to identify property owners who hold those attitudes, planners can ensure that all stakeholders are included in the tourism planning process.   M.
