Much of it also came into the market, and as there was very little capital in Ireland, and as Catholics were forbidden to purchase land, this also passed largely into the hands of English speculators. Besides, the level of civilization was much higher in England than in Ireland. The position of a Protestant landlord, living {{in the midst of a}} degraded population, differing from him in religion and race, had but little attraction, the political situation of the country closed to an Irish gentleman nearly every avenue of honourable ambition, and owing to a long series of very evident causes, the sentiment of public duty was deplorably low.

However, {{the pursuit of}} one goal can hamper the pursuit of another concurrent goal, bringing about goal conflicts. Despite evidence indicating that goal conflict may have a detrimental effect on subjective well-being, {{little is known about}} the effects of goal conflicts in a context of pain. The current study wished to experimentally investigate whether different types of goal conflict are associated with changes in pain-related fear and pain-related decision-making. Therefore, forty-six participants completed a cross-directional <b>movement</b> task <b>in</b> which participants first learned to associate <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> one direction (e. g. left) with pain, and <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction (e. g. right) with safety. Next, participants learned that <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> another direction (e. g. up) were associated with reward, and <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction (e. g. down) with loss. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> test phase, both phases were combined, creating different types of goal conflict: approach-approach, approach-avoidance, and avoidance-avoidance conflict. The results show that participants reported highest fear and least willingness to perform movements associated with two concurrent avoidance goals, and the least fear and highest willingness to perform movements associated with two concurrent approach goals. Participants reported intermediate levels of fear and willingness for approach-avoidance conflicts. Choice latencies indicate that participants were slower to make a choice when presented with an avoidance-avoidance conflict compared to approach-approach and avoidance-approach conflicts. status: publishe...|$|R

Over the past decades, various heads of this monster have been slayed: {{important}} breakthroughs have been achieved by and for women in law, politics, and economics.

Since different - often hybrid - heads of patriarchy dominate in different settings, feminism requires a variety of strategies. Women's movements all over the world today are critically creating new models of self and society in their own contexts.

The Overreaction Hypothesis states that extreme <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stocks prices {{will be followed by}} subsequent <b>movements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction; i. e. past losers significantly outperform past winners, which is a violation of the weak form efficiency. We examine the presence of such price correction and the success of contrarian strategies in İstanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) for the period of 1986 to 2001. We use a modified version of De Bondt and Thaler’s methodology to form winner, loser and arbitrage portfolios of one, two and three year formation / test periods. We find out that for all formation / test periods, there is a substantial price correction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market, which supports the Overreaction Hypothesis and the profitability of contrarian strategies. Our evidence may indicate that ISE is not weak form efficient. Furthermore, we inspect the foreign investors’ behaviour and its effects in ISE.

It is also found that foreign investors behave rationally since they use contrarian strategies in ISE. Germeyanoğlu, Ümit MehmetM. S...|$|R
