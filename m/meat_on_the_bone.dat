50|$|In {{collaboration}} with George, Kubrick started writing a screenplay based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> book. While writing the screenplay, they benefited from some brief consultations with Schelling and, later, Herman Kahn. In following {{the tone of}} the book, Kubrick originally intended to film the story as a serious drama. However, as he later explained during interviews, he began to see comedy inherent in the idea of mutual assured destruction as he wrote the first draft. Kubrick said:My idea of doing it as a nightmare comedy came in the early weeks of working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screenplay. I found that in trying to put <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> and to imagine the scenes fully, one had to keep leaving out of it things which were either absurd or paradoxical, in order to keep it from being funny; and these things seemed to be close {{to the heart of the}} scenes in question.|$|R

5000|$|In Salon.com, {{science writer}} PZ Myers criticized the fictional {{literary}} narrative technique, calling the book an [...] "arid wasteland," [...] but he principally criticized {{what he called}} the scientific deficiencies, [...] "The technicalities don't illuminate the story in any way, and the story undercuts the science. Ultimately, the neuroscience in the book feels a micrometer deep and a boring lifetime long, with the fiction of Harold and Erica giving the impression that it's built on a sample size of two, and both of them utterly imaginary... I don't know whom this book is really written for. It's definitely not going to satisfy any scientists, or even any informed people who {{want to know more about}} how the brain works— there's no technical <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> of this farce. It's certainly not going to satisfy anyone hoping for literary quality, or beauty and poetry, or even a good story. I suspect that its only virtue is in uniting C.P. Snow's two cultures, both of which will be populated with peeved readers flinging the book with great force across rooms everywhere." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{differs from}} the popular Greek dish souvlaki, in that meat cuts are much larger and slow cooked for a much longer period at a greater {{distance}} from the hot charcoal. Traditional souvla is made from the neck and shoulder of lamb, pork and chicken. <b>The</b> <b>meat</b> is cut <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> into chunks {{about the size of}} a medium onion (optional).|$|R
50|$|<b>Meat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> is {{quicker and}} easier to butcher {{as there is no}} {{filleting}} involved. Filleting is a skilled process that adds to labour and wastage costs as meat remaining on the bones after filleting is of low value (although it can be recovered). As a result, <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> can be better value for money. However, relative value can be hard to judge as the bone part of the product is inedible. Various portions may contain a greater or lesser proportion of bone.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} the three Yarra River stories in Tony Birch’s short fiction collections. ‘The Sea of Tranquillity’ ‘The Chocolate Empire’ and ‘The Toecutters’ all question the historical inscription of the Yarra that favours the culturally dominant account by {{placing it in}} relation to alternative stories. The torsion engendered by this questioning is apparent in the stories themselves. They are simultaneously discussions of class-based social exclusion and counter-stories of settlement; settled places are re-inscribed with meanings and histories obscured by the dominant account of ‘settlement’, which it thus critiques. The structure of the contemporary short story, to reveal a truth buried under the mundane details of life, aids Birch’s purpose. The form enacts a propensity to doubling, twinning and contrasting the familiar and the strange, or being at once in the dominant reality of the settler-colonial culture and, by social imposition, in {{the situation of the}} other. Hence, Birch’s stories open into narratives drawn from a number of socially marginalised groups, according to class, gender, geography or age. In Birch’s own account of his disillusionment with the institutionally-based academic writing of the post-history wars environment he speaks of embarking on an alternative project to ‘put <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> of history’, a project which involves turning from the Historian’s history to ‘the way that fiction deals with the past and its role in documenting history’: to bring history and story together (‘Trouble’ 235, 241). This essay traces that process in the three Yarra stories...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{point out that}} the {{generalized}} statistics of Tsallis-Havrda-Charvát can be conveniently used as a conceptual framework for statistical treatment of random chains. In particular, we use the path-integral approach to show that the ensuing partition function can be identified with the partition function of a fluctuating oriented random loop of arbitrary length and shape in a background scalar potential. To put some <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bare <b>bones,</b> we illustrate this with two statistical systems; Schultz-Zimm polymer and relativistic particle. Further salient issues such as the PSL(2;R) transformation properties of Tsallis' inverse-temperature parameter and a grandcanonical ensemble of fluctuating random loops related to the Tsallis-Havrda-Charvát statistics are also briefly discussed...|$|R

50|$|Some <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> is most {{commonly}} eaten by picking it up, notably ribs and chicken (wings, drumstick, sometimes thigh). Others are primarily eaten by {{cutting off the}} meat, such as steaks, but possibly picking up and gnawing the bone when otherwise finished.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{effect of}} cooking <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> {{is that it}} alters the flavour and texture. Albumen and collagen in the bones release gelatin when boiled which adds substance to stews, stocks, soups and sauces. The bone also conducts heat within the meat so that it cooks more evenly and prevents meat drying out and shrinking during cooking.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Meat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone,</b> {{also called}} bone-in meat is meat that is sold with {{some or all}} of the bones {{included}} in the cut or portion, i.e. meat that has not been filleted. The phrase [...] "on the bone" [...] can also be applied to specific types of meat, most commonly ham on the bone, and to fish. Meat or fish on the bone may be cooked and served with the bones still included or the bones may be removed at some stage in the preparation.|$|E
50|$|Spare ribs (also side ribs or spareribs) are {{a variety}} of pork ribs cooked and eaten in various cuisines around the world. They are cut from the lower portion of the pig {{specifically}} the belly and breastbone, behind the shoulder, and include 11 to 13 long bones. There is a covering of <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> and also between them. Spare ribs (pork) are distinguished from short ribs, which are beef.|$|R
5000|$|While the {{new game}} picks up where New 'n' Tasty! {{left off the}} same way Abe's Exoddus did after Abe's Oddysee, Lanning, said [...] "there was a deeper, darker, and more {{sinister}} story that we never got to tell and Soulstorm gives {{us the opportunity to}} flesh out more <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> of an original spine, but re-tell the fable from a very different angle." [...] At the time of Abe's Exoddus, Lanning had 9 months to produce the game, so he approved a script within a week to fast track production and reach the publisher's deadline of Christmas 1998. When revisiting the reviews of Exoddus, Lanning agreed with the consensus that it had [...] "twice the gameplay and half the heart." [...] Now with the time and freedom to make the game he always intended, he has decided against the New 'n' Tasty! principal of making the exact same game on new technology, and this time wants to use Exoddus as inspiration at a [...] "high concept level," [...] but telling a darker story <b>on</b> <b>the</b> New 'n' Tasty! engine. Lanning described the story in Abe's Oddysee as a classic fable, and changing it would be like changing a Dr Seuss story, but with Abe's Exoddus, the story is being rewritten to make [...] "twice the gameplay, twice the heart." [...] Soulstorm Brew is still at the centre of the story, but everything else has been rewritten. The first game was about Abe waking up to his own slavery, and Exoddus focused on their slavery to habits and addictions, but Lanning aims to make Soulstorm more volatile and devious by implementing mechanics left out of Exoddus that compares Soulstorm Brew to napalm and allows the player to splash surfaces and coat things to set them alight. Lanning also says the game is darker because Abe is going to realise the scope of his task to save the world, but that the Oddworld humour remains saying the game is funnier than ever before.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a broad overview of doctoral research into meaningful engagement with music making {{in a school}} context drawing upon a five-year participant-observation case study. It primarily involves {{an examination of the}} meaning of music to young people in an Australian school context and the processes that facilitate that involvement. It seeks to contribute to the understanding of how meaning and the processes that may give access to meaning in music education might be constructed and interpreted by teachers and curricula. The study privileges the voices of the student as makers of music in answering the question of meaning and access to meaningful music education but does so within a systemic environment which examines all aspects of context. The intention of the paper is to elaborate the meaning of music to young people and to explore the issues of how meaningful engagement might become transformative experience. The paper argues that meaning is located in social, personal and cultural experiences and suggests the need for access to all of these in music education. Through a narrative vignette drawn from the examination of context, it highlights the potential and possibilities of music experience for building and giving access to a range of music meanings. (The presentation will utilise recordings of children’s music embedded in the story to communicate these ideas.). An examination of the implications of what these ideas mean for a school, policy development and the characteristics and role of the teacher is drawn from the vignette. The study seeks to ‘put <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> of theory’ and prior to the conclusion lists the theoretical tenets that inform the study and in turn reciprocally enable a thicker description of each aspect of theory which contributes to the robustness of this theory. In conclusion, the paper seeks to describe how teachers might teach in and construct environments where students can make meaningful music and experience a transformation of consciousness that constitutes music learning...|$|R

5000|$|Mechanically {{separated}} meat (MSM), mechanically recovered/reclaimed meat (MRM), or mechanically deboned meat (MDM) is a paste-like {{meat product}} produced by forcing pureed or ground beef, pork, turkey or chicken, under high pressure through a sieve or similar device to separate <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> from <b>the</b> edible meat tissue. It {{is sometimes called}} white slime as an analog to meat-additive pink slime and to meat extracted by advanced meat recovery systems, {{both of which are}} different processes. The process entails pureeing or grinding the carcass left after the manual removal of meat from <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> and then forcing the slurry through a sieve under pressure. This puree includes bone, bone marrow, skin, nerves, blood vessels, and the scraps of <b>meat</b> remaining <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones.</b> <b>The</b> resulting product is a blend primarily consisting of tissues not generally considered meat along with a much smaller amount of actual meat (muscle tissue).

If there is not enough <b>meat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone,</b> he will only teach the supplicant how to tune the fiddle.
