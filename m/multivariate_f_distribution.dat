In particular, for a general class of so-called Type D depth functions including the well-known Tukey or halfspace depth, we obtain influence functions for the depth function itself, the depth distribution function, the depth quantile function, and corresponding depth-based generalized quantile functions. Robustness behavior similar to the usual univariate quantiles is found and quantified: the influence functions are of step function form with finite gross error sensitivity but infinite local shift sensitivity. Applications to a “scale” curve, a Lorenz curve for “tailweight”, and a “kurtosis” curve are treated.

Simplification of the formula of the Wilson-Hilferty transformation, through the median formula, leads us to construct a power normal family from the generalized <b>F</b> <b>distribution.</b> Unlike the Box-Cox power normal family, our family has a property that the covariance structure of the maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters is invariant under a scale transformation of the response variable.
