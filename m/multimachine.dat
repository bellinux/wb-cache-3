5000|$|At a high-level, the <b>multimachine</b> {{is built}} using vehicle engine blocks {{combined}} in a LEGO-like fashion. It utilizes the cylinder bores and engine deck to provide accurate surfaces. Since cylinder bores are bored exactly parallel {{to each other}} and at exact right angles to the cylinder head surface, <b>multimachine</b> accuracy begins at the factory where the engine block was built. In the most common version of the <b>multimachine,</b> one that has a roller bearing spindle, this precision is maintained during construction with simple cylinder re-boring of the #3 cylinder {{to the size of the}} roller bearing outside diameter (OD) and re-boring the #1 cylinder to fit the overarm OD. These cylinder-boring operations can be done in almost any engine shop and at low cost. An engine machine shop provides the most inexpensive and accurate machine work commonly done anywhere and guarantees that the spindle and overarm will be perfectly aligned and at an exact right angle to the face (head surface) of the main engine block that serves as the base of the machine. Use a piece of pipe made to fit the inner diameter of the bearings as the spindle. A three-bearing spindle is used because the [...] "main" [...] spindle bearings just [...] "float" [...] in the cylinder bore so that the third bearing is needed to [...] "locate" [...] the spindle, act as a thrust bearing, and support the heavy pulley. The <b>multimachine</b> uses a unique way of clamping the engine blocks together that is easily built, easily adjusted, and very accurate. The <b>multimachine</b> makes use of a concrete and steel construction technique that was heavily used in industry during the First World War and resurrected for this project.|$|E

40|$|Currently, many {{injection}} machine controllers {{in the market}} involve PC-based architecture, so engineers can conduct simple and quick operation on the controller via a human-machine interface. However, when {{there are too many}} machines in a factory, mining algorithms for <b>multimachines</b> and development of rear-end applications are often trivial and complicated. The operation systems of the machines in factories are different, and different machine models need different transfer protocols for data mining. Therefore, we need to develop different information platforms and machine production information mining systems for cross platform controllers.

The agent-based production remote monitor system framework in this research has the following advantages. (1) It can transmit machine information cross platforms regard of constraints of different operating systems. Controlling frameworks can process data mining and transmission.

40|$|The steel {{industry}} {{is responsible for}} nearly 9 % of anthropogenic energy utilization in the world. It is urgent to reduce the total energy utilization of {{steel industry}} under the huge pressures on reducing energy consumption and CO 2 emission. Meanwhile, the steel manufacturing is a typical continuous-discrete process with multiprocedures, multiobjects, multiconstraints, and <b>multimachines</b> coupled, which makes energy management rather difficult. In order to study the energy flow within the real steel production process, this paper presents a new modeling and optimization method for the process based on Hybrid Petri Nets (HPN) in consideration of the situation above. Firstly, we introduce the detailed description of HPN. Then the real steel production process from one typical integrated steel plant is transformed into Hybrid Petri Net model as a case. Furthermore, we obtain a series of constraints of our optimization model from this model. In consideration of the real process situation, we pick the steel production, energy efficiency and self-made gas surplus as the main optimized goals in this paper. Afterwards, a fuzzy linear programming method is conducted to obtain the multiobjective optimization results.
