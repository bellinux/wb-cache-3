5|$|Although cholangiocarcinoma {{is known}} to have the {{histological}} and molecular features of an adenocarcinoma of epithelial cells lining the biliary tract, the actual cell of origin is unknown. Recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor may arise from a pluripotent hepatic stem cell. Cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages - from early hyperplasia and <b>metaplasia,</b> through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma - in a process similar to that seen in the development of colon cancer. Chronic inflammation and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are thought {{to play a role in}} this progression.|$|E

The majority of goblet cell <b>metaplasias</b> was {{seen at the}} bronchiolo-alveolar junction as round, mucus-filled nodules with a diameter of 1 - 20 mm. Their periphery consisted of a single layer of well differentiated columnar goblet cells. In central mucus-filled areas, alveolar epithelium and septae were often markedly reduced.

In addition to the classical nuclear and cytoplasmic indicators of atypism, the squamous <b>metaplasias</b> with slight and moderate atypia were characterized {{by the presence of}} glycogen in the spinous layer, atypical composite keratohyalin granules in the granular layer, and in most cases an orthokeratinized horny layer. The squamous <b>metaplasias</b> with severe atypia showed an increased secretory activity and a decreased number of desmosomes. Carcinomas in situ were characterized by numerous intracellular and extracellular microcysts filled with secretory material identified by histochemical techniques as containing neutral glycoproteins and sialomucins. Microinvasive carcinoma showed similar characteristics, with an increase in polylobulated nuclei and appearance of multilaminar ergastoplasm. An outstanding feature in all these lesions was the presence of dark fusiform epithelial cells. They were observed in the middle layers in the squamous <b>metaplasias</b> with severe atypia and appeared in all layers of the carcinomas in situ...|$|R
50|$|The cell {{of origin}} for {{many types of}} <b>metaplasias</b> are {{controversial}} or unknown. For example, there is evidence supporting several different hypotheses of origin in Barrett's esophagus.

40|$|AIMS: To {{study the}} {{association}} between morphological changes of the bronchial epithelium and its angiogenic status evaluated by microvessel count (MVC), {{in order to gain}} a better understanding of bronchial carcinogenesis. Also, to correlate MVC with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-three biopsy specimens were assessed for MVC: four normal bronchial epithelia, 23 hyperplasias, 26 <b>metaplasias,</b> two mild dysplasias, five moderate dysplasias, nine severe dysplasias, three carcinomas in situ, six early invasive squamous cell carcinomas (EIC) and five cases of micropapillomatosis. We observed a statistically significant difference in terms of MVC between EIC and all other subgroups and between micropapillomatosis and all other subgroups. There was also a statistically significant difference between micropapillomatosis and EIC. We did not observe any difference in MVC between normal mucosa, <b>metaplasias,</b> hyperplasias, dysplasias or carcinoma in situ. EGFR expression was higher in severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ and EIC, whereas it was very low in micropapillomatosis. A statistically significant difference was observed in the expression profile of EGFR vs. MVC. EGFR expression was increased in severe dysplasia, whereas an increase in MVC occurred only in EIC. CONCLUSION: During bronchial carcinogenesis, except for micropapillomatosis, EGFR expression appears to be a prerequisite for neoangiogenesis in bronchial carcinogenesis.

40|$|An in situ {{hybridization}} technique was applied to detect expression of keratin mRNAs in xenotransplanted human tracheobronchial epithelium and lung carcinomas. Tissues from eight tracheas repopulated with cells from five different noncancerous donors and 15 squamous cell carcinomas were used. Using a K 6 (56 kd) human keratin cDNA (KA- 1) and a K 14 (50 kd) cDNA (KB- 2) as probes, radiolabeled by nick-translation with 3 H-dATP/TTP, the specificity and {{significant differences in the}} levels of silver grains on various epithelial lesions in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were demonstrated. In situ hybridization with either KA- 1 or KB- 2 probe showed similar localization of silver grains in all histologic types in consecutive tissue sections. In xenotransplanted tracheobronchial epithelia, very few grains were seen over cells of simple, pseudostratified, or stratified epithelia two to three cell layers thick. Nonkeratinizing stratified hyperplastic epithelia of more than three cell layers showed uniform localization of numerous grains throughout the lesions. In contrast, epidermoid <b>metaplasias</b> exhibited a dense and localized pattern of grains on the basal and parabasal cell layers with a decrease in grain density toward the surface layers. Carcinoma cells from bronchogenic squamous cell carcinomas showed a higher density and more uniform localization of grains. Well-differentiated carcinoma cells contained more keratin mRNAs than moderately to poorly differentiated carcinoma cells. This evidence obtained with the KA- 1 and KB- 2 probes demonstrates the different localization patterns of keratin mRNAs in different epithelial lesions. In addition, the levels of mRNA expressed show a positive correlation with the degree of squamous differentiation. It was of particular interest that an ordered program of keratin mRNA expression proportional to the level of cellular differentiation was observed in epidermoid <b>metaplasias.</b> Both of these probes serve as keratinization markers of human tracheobronchial epithelial lesions...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. Nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), a key {{transcription}} factor thought {{to play a}} major role in carcinogenesis, regulates many important signaling pathways involved in tumor promotion. Although NF-kB can be activated in lung cancer cell lines by tobacco exposure, there have been no studies of the expression of NF-kB in lung cancer pathogenesis. METHODS. The immunohistochemical expression of NF-kB p 65 was investigated in 394 lung cancers (370 nonsmall cell lung carcinomas [NSCLC]; and 24 small cell lung carcinomas [SCLC]) and 269 lung normal epithelium and preneoplastic lesions, including hyperplasias, squamous <b>metaplasias,</b> dysplasias, and atypical adenomatous hyperplasias. RESULTS. High levels of nuclear immunohistochemical expression of NF-kB p 65 were detected in the lung cancers, with significantly higher levels in SCLCs com-pared with NSCLCs (P <. 0001). In adenocarcinomas the NF-kB p 65 expression level was significantly higher in advanced TNM stages (III-IV) than in earlier stages (I-II) (P <. 0001), and when NF-kB p 65 is dichotomized using 50 % as the cutof...|$|R

This results in docking of STAT6 monomers, which themselves are phosphorylated and then subsequently leave the receptor and congregate form STAT6 homodimers in the cytoplasm. These homodimers then enter the nucleus, where they bind to regulatory elements in the DNA, which affects the transcription of certain genes involved in mucus production.|$|E

We favor one of these deficient hypotheses, that Barrettâs arises from a distinct lineage of junctional cells present in all normal individuals, and discuss efforts to shore it up.

The truncating germline mutation CHEK 2 * 1100 delC abrogates kinase activity and confers low-penetrance susceptibility to breast cancer. We found CHEK 2 * 1100 delC in 0. 5 % of 190 oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas and in 1. 5 % of 196 oesophageal adenocarcinomas. In addition, we observed the mutation in 3. 0 % of 99 Barrett's <b>metaplasias</b> and 1. 5 % of 66 dysplastic Barrett's epithelia, both known precursor lesions of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Since CHEK 2 * 1100 delC mutation frequencies {{did not significantly}} differ among oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas and (dysplastic) Barrett's epithelia, as compared to healthy individuals, we conclude that the CHEK 2 * 1100 delC mutation has no major contribution in oesophageal carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract of complex metazoans is highly compartmentalized. It is lined {{by a series}} of specialized epithelia that are regenerated by specific populations of stem cells.

25|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{function}} of retinal as a visual chromophore, {{one of the earliest}} and specific manifestations of vitamin A deficiency is impaired vision, particularly in reduced light – night blindness. Persistent deficiency gives rise to a series of changes, the most devastating of which occur in the eyes. Some other ocular changes are referred to as xerophthalmia. First there is dryness of the conjunctiva (xerosis) as the normal lacrimal and mucus-secreting epithelium is replaced by a keratinized epithelium. This is followed by the build-up of keratin debris in small opaque plaques (Bitot's spots) and, eventually, erosion of the roughened corneal surface with softening and destruction of the cornea (keratomalacia) and leading to total blindness. Other changes include impaired immunity (increased risk of ear infections, urinary tract infections, Meningococcal disease), hyperkeratosis (white lumps at hair follicles), keratosis pilaris and squamous <b>metaplasia</b> of the epithelium lining the upper respiratory passages and urinary bladder to a keratinized epithelium.

40|$|The histopathologic {{spectrum}} of lesions intervening in chronic pancreatitis {{is illustrated by}} 2 anatomopathologic series: the 1 st one grouping 35 randomly chosen necropsy cases; the 2 nd being composed of 15 surgical specimens. The necropsy series demonstrated the high frequency of 'minor' lesions characterized by canalicular ectasias and pericanalicular or perilobular fibrosis. In the surgical material more severe forms of chronic pancreatitis were observed. Two types of parenchymal injuries could be discriminated, with a different histologic composition and topographic distribution. The first one, most often found in the pancreas head, consists of scar like fibrosis disturbing the lobular structure, frequently accompanied by pseudocysts and calcifications. The second kind is essentially detected in the caudal region; fine bundles of fibrous tissue dissect the pancreatic lobules and acini which progressively disappear, leaving oval scars in which canalicular and endocrine <b>metaplasias</b> often develop (islet cell hyperplasias).
