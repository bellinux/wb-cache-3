40|$|Abstract Background Most {{hospitals}} {{keep and}} update their paper-based medical records after introducing an {{electronic medical record}} or a hospital information system (HIS). This case report describes a HIS in a hospital where the paper-based medical records are scanned and eliminated. To evaluate the HIS comprehensively, the perspectives of <b>medical</b> <b>secretaries</b> and nurses are described {{as well as that}} of physicians. Methods We have used questionnaires and interviews to assess and compare frequency of use of the HIS for essential tasks, task performance and user satisfaction among <b>medical</b> <b>secretaries,</b> nurses and physicians. Results The <b>medical</b> <b>secretaries</b> use the HIS much more than the nurses and the physicians, and they consider that the electronic HIS greatly has simplified their work. The work of nurses and physicians has also become simplified, but they find less satisfaction with the system, particularly with the use of scanned document images. Conclusions Although the basis for reference is limited, the results support the assertion that replacing the paper-based medical record primarily benefits the <b>medical</b> <b>secretaries,</b> and to a lesser degree the nurses and the physicians. The varying results in the different employee groups emphasize the need for a multidisciplinary approach when evaluating a HIS. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} cross-sectional, causal {{study was}} to {{determine}} the temperament characteristics, anger and associated variables of <b>medical</b> <b>secretaries.</b> Methods: The study population included <b>medical</b> <b>secretaries</b> working in a university hospital. The sample of the study included 95 individuals who agreed to participate in this research. Study data were obtained using the Socio-demographic Data Form, Temperament and Character Inventory, Trait Anger Expression Inventory. Results: Trait anger was higher in men and divorced ones. Outward anger was higher in individuals with higher level of education. A positive correlation was determined between inward anger and self-transcendence scores of participants. A negative correlation was determined between outward anger and self-transcendence, cooperation, persistence, reward dependence, harm avoidance, novelty seeking scores of participants. A positive correlation was determined between anger control and self-transcendence, cooperation, self-directedness, persistence, reward dependence, harm avoidance and novelty seeking scores of participants. Conclusion: These results show that <b>medical</b> <b>secretaries</b> have high trait anger and lack means to express anger healthily...|$|R

40|$|The {{overarching}} {{aim of this}} dissertation is {{to study}} what happens with occupational identities in occupations subject to substantial and protracted pressure for change, more specifically in administrative service occupations in Sweden today. The dissertation centres on two cases within this broader category: <b>medical</b> <b>secretaries</b> and post-office cashiers. Typically for administrative service occupations, both have {{a large majority of}} women and their existence has repeatedly been questioned. At the same time, they represent two diverging lines of the differentiation this type of occupations has gone through. While the <b>medical</b> <b>secretaries</b> so far have kept their place in medical/health care, the post-office cashiers have gone from expansion of the work content in the 1980 s and 1990 s to dequalification, splitting, and finally being abolished. The study combines interviews as a main source of data with various types of text material. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2004 – 05 with a total of 39 <b>medical</b> <b>secretaries</b> and post-office cashiers. The theoretical backbone of the dissertation is a pluralistic identity perspective combined with an intersectional analysis that takes into consideration various bases of identity like gender and class but also modernity. Focus is also put on the use of discourses and narratives. The results support the view that it is meaningful to speak of occupational identity in administrative service occupations and, more generally, that it is neither an obsolete phenomenon nor something reserved for well-defined professional, high-status or craft occupations. Both secretaries and cashiers have occupational identities which are distinct and strong within certain limits. There is a distinct core of tasks, competences and ethical norms that stands out as generally considered important. This core is also in many respects the same in both occupations (emphasizing among other things the balanced exertion of carefulness and service), which points toward the plausibility of the concept ‘administrative service’. There is furthermore some basis for suggesting that a strong but delimited occupational identity of this type can be evoked by technological and economic changes if these are perceived to collide with human and social concerns, and that it can also - at least under some circumstances - be a resource for resistance and action. Swedish <b>medical</b> <b>secretaries</b> constitute an example of this. In their collective identity work, they walk a fine line between embracing contemporary discourses of modernization, professionalization and change, and holding their ground in spheres of the occupation that easily get dismissed or neglected in these discourses...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Unfavorable psychosocial working {{conditions}} are hypothesized {{to lead to}} perceived stress, which, in turn, {{can be related to}} an increased risk of development of neck/shoulder symptoms through increased and sustained muscle activation. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test this hypothesized process model among <b>medical</b> <b>secretaries,</b> a female-dominated profession characterized by a high amount of visual display unit use and a high prevalence of neck/shoulder symptoms. Methods In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire survey was conducted among <b>medical</b> <b>secretaries</b> (n = 200). The proposed process model was tested using a path model framework. Results The results indicate that high work demands were related to high perceived stress, which in turn was related to a high perceived muscle tension and neck/shoulder symptoms. Low influence at work was not related to perceived stress, but was directly related to a high perceived muscle tension. Conclusions In general, these cross-sectional results lend tentative support for the hypothesis that adverse psychosocial work conditions (high work demands) may contribute to the development of neck/shoulder symptoms through the mechanism of stress-induced sustained muscular activation. This process model needs to be further tested in longitudinal studies...|$|R
