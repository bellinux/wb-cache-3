Curt obtained his PhD in Chemistry from the University of Minnesota. Runtime: 42 : 46 minutesAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy have been combined in a single instrument capable of producing nanoscale spatial resolution IR spectra and images. This new capability enables the spectroscopic characterization of microdomain-forming polymers at levels not previously possible. Films of poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyheanoate) were solution cast on ZnSe prisms, followed by melting and annealing to generate spherulites of different sizes. A tunable IR laser generating pulses of the order of 10 ns was used for excitation of the sample films. Short duration thermal waves, due to infrared absorption, were studied by monitoring the resulting excitation of the contact resonance modes of the AFM cantilever. Dramatic differences in the IR spectra are observed in the 1200 - 1300 cm- 1 range as a function of position on a spatial scale of less than one micron. This spectral region is particularly sensitive to the polymer crystallinity, enabling the identification of crystalline and amorphous domains within a single spherulite of this copolymer. The talk will focus on four key points: The nanoIR instrument enables, for the first time, the spectroscopic differentiation of local regions of molecular order in microdomain-forming copolymers at nanoscale spatial resolutions. Studying biodegradable poly(hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) copolymer, the AFM-IR technique reveals crystalline and amorphous microdomain spectra not previously seen with bulk FTIR. By collecting spectra at 200 -nm increments starting from a nucleation site, it is possible to gain insights into the crystallization mechanism of polymer systems. Using heating via nanoscale thermal probes, the researchers locally modified the crystalline content and observed corresponding changes in nanoscale IR absorption spectra...|$|R

50|$|Flowering is not common, {{and there}} are no seeds. Fruits are rare due to low pollen {{viability}} caused by irregular meiosis. At the interval of several decades, the whole population of an area blooms at once, and individual stems bear a large number of flowers. Vegetation propagates through clump division, by rhizome, stem and branch cutting, layering, and <b>marcotting.</b> The easiest and most practised cultivation method is culm or branch cutting. In the Philippines, the best results were obtained from one-node cuttings from the lower parts of six-month-old culms. When a stem dies, the clump usually survives. A clump can grow out of stem used for poles, fences, props, stakes, or posts. Its rhizomes extend up to 80 cm before turning upward to create open, fast-spreading clumps.

The wound is then surrounded with a lump of moisture-retaining medium such as sphagnum moss or cloth, and then further surrounded by a moisture barrier such as plastic film tied or taped to the branch to prevent moisture loss or ingress of too much water as from rain. Rooting hormone is often applied to the wound to encourage root growth. When sufficient roots have grown from the wound, the stem {{is removed from the}} parent plant and planted, taking care to shield it from too much sun and to protect it from drying out until the new roots take hold. It can take the layer from a few weeks to one or more growing seasons to produce sufficient roots; this is largely dependent on the plant species and the vigor of the parent plant.|$|E

40|$|The pummelo, Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck, is {{the most}} {{tropical}} of the citrus fruits, yet is poorly distributed, underutilized, and often unknown. It is an excellent fruit, however, which finds ready acceptance wherever tried. Pummelos probably originated in China but were carried to Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, where their evolution has continued and where many varieties are now available. The tree is large and spreading, with large, winged leaves, and frequently with thorns. The flower is very large for a citrus (3 - 5 cm in diameter), and the fruits vary from large to extra large. The rind is often thick. At maturity the sweet to subacid fruit vesicles separate easily from the membrane of the segments and are served in a dish as a dessert fruit. Varieties of pummelo can be classified as Thailand group (best tropical varieties), Chinese group (better suited to subtropics), and Indonesian group (extremely variable and sometimes inferior). The pummelo produces a monoembryonic, normal, sexual seed, and thus can be improved by breeding. Improved varieties are maintained by bud and cleft grafting {{as well as by}} <b>marcotting.</b> Culture {{is similar to that of}} other citrus trees, but the trees need somewhat larger growing areas. Cover crops or cash crops can be planted among the trees until they are too large. Normal chemical treatment schedules for pests and weeds can be used, but have not been adequately tried with the pummelo. Some pummelos are tolerant to foot rot, a disease that always requires careful treatment. Since flowering may occur several times a year, fruiting is irregular, but usually one harvesting season predominates. The fruit is picked just as it yellows or later, and is more flavorful when stored for several months. Because of its thick rind, the pummelo is easy to ship and keeps well even in common storage.

40|$|Game-theoretic {{solution}} concepts—most {{notably the}} Shapley value, arguably, {{the most important}} normative payoff division scheme in coalitional games—have recently been advocated as useful measures of centrality in networks. This new approach has several advantages over the standard one and {{has a variety of}} real-world applications (in-cluding social and organisational networks, biological networks and communication networks. It may be, however, computationally challenging. Unfortunately, to this date, there are only a handful of studies of computational aspects of game-theoretic network centralities. The goal of this research project is to fill the above gap in the literature and perform a thorough analysis of computational properties of network centrality measures based on game-theoretic solution concepts. Reducing complexity of computing solution concepts requires additional as-sumptions on the underlying games. We are planning to test the tractable centrality measures we will find against a prominent application area of analysis of influence propagation in social networks. Standard approach to centrality in networks: Networks are a very natural representation of a variety of real-life domains such as urban structures (Porta, Crucitti, & Latora, 2006), protein interactions (Bork, Jensen, Mering, Ramani, Lee, & <b>Marcott,</b> 2004) or social networks (Wasserman & Faust, 1994).

40|$|One of {{the most}} abrupt and yet unexplained past rises in {{atmospheric}} CO 2 (10 ppmv in two centuries in the EPICA Dome C [EDC] ice core) occurred in quasi-synchrony with abrupt northern hemispheric warming into the Bølling/Allerød, about 14. 6 ka ago. In Köhler et al. (2014) we used a U/Th-dated record of atmospheric Δ 14 C from Tahiti corals to provide an independent and precise age control for this CO 2 rise. We also used model simulations {{to show that the}} release of old (nearly 14 C-free) carbon can explain these changes in CO 2 and Δ 14 C. The Δ 14 C record provides an independent constraint on the amount of carbon released (125 PgC). We suggest, in line with observations of atmospheric CH 4 and terrigenous biomarkers, that thawing permafrost in high northern latitudes could have been the source of carbon, possibly with contribution from flooding of the Siberian continental shelf during meltwater pulse 1 A. Our findings highlight the potential of the permafrost carbon reservoir to modulate abrupt climate changes via greenhouse-gas feedbacks. These calculations and conclusions were challenged by the new CO 2 data (<b>Marcott</b> et al. 2014) from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide Ice Core (WDC), which have a higher temporal resolution. We therefore revised our carbon release experiments in order to meet these new WDC CO 2 data. We furthermore used a new age distribution during gas enclosure in ice which includes the most recent understanding of firn densification. We then can align EDC and WDC CO 2 data and propose a peak amplitude in atmospheric CO 2 of about 15 ppmv around 14. 6 ka BP corresponding to a C pulse of 85 PgC released in 200 years (0. 425 PgC per year).

40|$|In a {{wide range}} of crops the average yield loss caused by {{nematodes}} is estimated to be 10 - 15 %. Sometimes it can be total. Food and cash crops are susceptible to one of the many types of these tiny soil-borne, thread-like parasitic roundworms. They feed and reproduce within the host plant, affect growth, and can cause distorted seeds, and rotten or malformed roots and tubers. Damaged tissues cannot get enough nutrients and water from the soil to maintain normal growth, and a poor harvest results. Often farmers attribute this disappointing performance to poor soil, water stress, or salinity rather than to the true cause Once a soil is infested {{it is virtually impossible to}} eliminate the nematodes, removing the host plant for long periods by crop rotation is rarely adequate. However, damage can be limited. Since most plant-parasitic nematodes spend part of their life-cycle in the soil, they can be killed there by nematicides, but two major disadvantages of these are their toxicity, and the fact that their effect is short-term. Thus repeated use is necessary to prevent a resurgence of the problem later in the growing season. Despite the widespread and serious damage caused by nematodes in the Tropics, the use of nematicides is not common because farmers lack financial resources. While removing the host plant for long periods by crop rotation is inadequate to control nematodes, appropriate techniques exist which are less costly and less damaging to man and to the environment than the repeated use of chemicals. Under slash and burn systems or shifting cultivation, land was unlikely to become nematode-infested; however, the natural balance is easily upset by fixed farming and the introduction of new crops and cultivars. Identifying nematode damage The detection of nematodes is the first step to control. Relatively few nematodes can be passed on in seed but, of those that are, some are easily detectable by their effects such as the blackened seed galls caused in wheat and distorted and discoloured seeds of beans. The peanut/groundnut seed nematode found in Nigeria makes the seed shrivelled and dark brown, and is seed transmitted if the seeds are left in their pods or are not thoroughly dried. A rice nematode, Ditylenchus angustus, is found in freshly-harvested seeds, and can also be killed by sun-drying but, like a number of foliar nematodes, can still be carried in plant debris mixed with seed. In yams and potatoes, nematodes produce small yellow lesions just under the surface which develop into a dark brown dry rot and some cause knobbly tubers. Infected tubers must not be used for planting. Nematodes are common causes of damage to dessert and cooking bananas. They are spread in the vegetative corms used to grow new plants, and the symptoms are most noticeable in the roots of suckers immediately after lifting - as purple or dark brown lesions seen when the root is split lengthwise. There may also be dark areas on the root surface. The first signs of nematode infection in taro are red streaks in the centre of the corm; these allow bacteria and fungi to establish, and the corm can rot away completely. All seedlings should have their roots checked for swellings, or galls or distorted shapes prior to transplanting. Unlike Rhizobium nodules in leguminous plants, nematode galls are an integral part of the root. Damage limitation Once a farmer notices nematode damage to root or leaf, there is little to be done that season other than to remove and destroy infected plants and increase amounts of water and fertiliser to compensate. In alleycropping, perennial trees and food and cash crops can even exchange nematodes, but the problem can be contained by careful choice of planting material and land use. Nematode-free stem cuttings can be taken from sugar cane and cassava, and also from kumara, though tubers and roots can pass on the pest. Using part of a yam tuber for planting means that farmers can check for damage. Citrus can be propagated by <b>marcotts</b> or cuttings. Extension services must avoid distributing nematodes with cocoa, coffee or other tree seedlings. Seedbed soils can be kept pestfree by annual or seasonal rotation of the seedbed site, always using previously uncultivated ground. Dry season crop seed beds can be allowed to flood; wet season crop seedbeds should be kept free of weeds; soil can be turned frequently in dry periods since exposure to the sun kills a large proportion of nematodes; brushwood, crop, seed residues, and dried dung may be burned to kill the nematodes Nematode populations can also be reduced by incorporating chicken manure, green manure, sawdust, cocoa pods or cassava peelings into the soil. Some plants, such as mustard and marigold (Tagetes spp) have nematicidal properties. Strict plant hygiene and early detection will help prevent the disastrous damage wreaked by nematodes, and are far cheaper and less hazardous than the use of chemical nematicides.
