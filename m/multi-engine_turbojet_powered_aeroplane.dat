50|$|The Pratt & Whitney JT3 <b>turbojets</b> <b>powered</b> the {{original}} Boeing 707 and DC-8 models; {{in the early}} 1960s the JT3 was modified into the JT3D low-bypass turbofan for long-range 707 and DC-8 variants.|$|R

50|$|The Lippisch P.20 was a {{proposed}} World War II German fighter aircraft. The P.20 design of April 1943 {{was an attempt}} to further develop the rocket-powered Me 163 interceptor into a feasible <b>turbojet</b> <b>powered</b> fighter.|$|R
5000|$|... 27 August 1939: Flight of the world's first <b>{{turbojet}}</b> <b>power</b> aircraft. Hans von Ohain's Heinkel He 178 V1 pioneer {{turbojet aircraft}} prototype makes its first flight, powered by an He S 3 von Ohain engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was not a}} success due to problems with vibrations in the engine-to-propeller extension shaft and so the {{aircraft was}} converted to <b>turbojet</b> <b>power.</b> Eventually it was completely redesigned to become the Viper Aircraft ViperJet MKII.|$|R
5000|$|The HT-180 is a <b>turbojet</b> <b>powered</b> subsonic drone {{currently}} under development by NCHU. The HT-180 has a cylindrical fuselage with a pointed nose cone and swept wings. Side intake are mounted between the swept wing and tailplanes. Specifications: ...|$|R

50|$|Although China was {{satisfied}} {{with the performance of}} its own Changfeng series land attack cruise missile, an inherent problem with this <b>turbojet</b> <b>powered</b> Changfeng (missile) meant that the size and weight of the missile were too large to be carried by aerial platforms in Chinese inventory and the range of the missile was inadequate. A turbofan powered version was needed, but due to the limitation of Chinese R&D and industrial capability of the time, this could not be achieved immediately. As a result, China decided to take a two-step approach, first to have the <b>turbojet</b> <b>powered</b> Changfeng missile meet the immediate need, then complete development on a turbofan powered version like the Tomahawk (missile) for deployment on aerial platforms while China was building up its industrial infrastructure.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of having CJ-1 AShM {{is that while}} having similar range in comparison to C-801 that is also powered by solid rocket motor, the warhead of CJ-1 AShM is {{more than four times}} larger, while when armed with smaller warhead, the range of CJ-1 AShM can be extended to over 60% to 80 km. The same {{advantage of}} CJ-1 AShM has over C-801 also holds in comparison to the <b>turbojet</b> <b>powered</b> C-802, and additionally, the solid rocket powered CJ-1 has another great advantage in that it is much easier and cheaper to maintain. According to Russian claims, 91RE1 can be put away and stored for three years, and this advantage is inherited in its Chinese upgrade. In contrast, any <b>turbojet</b> <b>powered</b> missile would require periodic maintenance in storage, thus increasing the cost.|$|R
50|$|Also in 1957, Saratoga {{conducted}} Regulus {{guided missile}} tests. She {{was one of}} ten aircraft carriers configured to operate the <b>turbojet</b> <b>powered</b> subsonic guided missile and only one of six carriers to ever actually launch the missile (performing two test launches) providing the first United States Navy nuclear strategic deterrence force.|$|R
5000|$|Flight Engineer Certifications are {{applicable}} to large transportation aircraft (more than 80,000 lb). Flight Engineer Certificates are further Rated {{by type of}} engine they are trained and tested on: <b>Turbojet</b> <b>Powered,</b> Turbopropeller Powered, Reciprocating Engine Powered. Flight Engineers are becoming less common as modern jets move towards two person flight crews.|$|R
50|$|The IJN {{may have}} asked Kawanishi to {{consider}} a <b>turbojet</b> <b>powered</b> flying boat or {{it may have been}} a company initiative. Support for the latter comes from the IJN's request for the Kawanishi H11K Soku and the K-60, both large flying boats, and thus the suggestion may have been put forth.|$|R
50|$|First flown on 26 December 1956 on <b>turbojet</b> <b>power</b> alone, the ramjet {{was finally}} fired on the 34th flight, on 18 May 1957. Another 80 flights took {{place before the}} {{cancellation}} of the project in favour of the more conventional Dassault Mirage III. A second prototype was under construction at the time.|$|R
50|$|The glider snatch pick-up {{technique}} {{was used by}} the Allies in WW2. It allowed military gliders to be launched from a stationary position on the ground by a low-flying <b>powered</b> <b>aeroplane</b> (the tow or tug), flying low overhead but which did not have to land.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the use of}} a canard {{surface on}} the first <b>powered</b> <b>aeroplane,</b> the Wright Flyer of 1903, canard designs were not built in {{quantity}} until the appearance of the Saab Viggen jet fighter in 1967. The aerodynamics of the canard configuration are complex and require careful analysis.|$|R

5000|$|The EFW N-20 Aiguillon (in English: [...] "Stinger") was Switzerland's first {{indigenous}} jet fighter aircraft. The Swiss Federal Aircraft Factory {{developed a}} {{design for a}} four-engined swept winged fighter {{following the end of}} the Second World War. During the test programme an unpowered glider was built and flown. A <b>turbojet</b> <b>powered</b> test aircraft, known as the Arbal√®te ("Crossbow"), also flew.|$|R
5000|$|The Chang Feng, or [...] "Long Wind" [...] is a <b>turbojet</b> <b>powered</b> land-attack cruise missile, indigenously {{developed}} by China.

S-200W is mainly used to support the development of electro-optics and radars of air defense systems, and {{it can also be}} used to train air defense forces. Specification: ...|$|R
2500|$|Later in 1907 the Army {{decided to}} back the {{development}} of his <b>powered</b> <b>aeroplane,</b> the British Army Aeroplane No 1. After just under a year of construction, he started testing the machine in September 1908, gradually lengthening his [...] "hops" [...] until they reached [...] on 16 October 1908.|$|R
50|$|He married Effie B Lewis on 10 October 1888. They {{had three}} children: Helen Anajane Besler (1892-1989), George Daniel Besler (1902-1995), and William John Besler (1904-1985). His sons, George and William, {{went on to}} make the world's first steam <b>powered</b> <b>aeroplane</b> at Oakland, California, on 12 April 1933.|$|R
