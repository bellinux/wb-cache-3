5|$|Laliberté {{sought out}} Gilles Ste-Croix as {{replacement}} for the artistic director position. Ste-Croix, who had been away from the company since 1985, agreed to return. The company went through more internal troubles, including a failed attempt to add Normand Latourelle as a third <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> partnership. This triumvirate lasted only six months before internal disagreements prompted Gauthier and Laliberté to buy out Latourelle. By the end of 1989, Cirque du Soleil was once again in a deficit.|$|E

Additionally, {{a small portion of}} the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness extends into the extreme northwestern part of the forest, along the Montana border.

5|$|As Garfield entered {{office in}} March 1881, the Republican party schism {{that had been}} patched up for the {{election}} tore apart once more. Garfield appointed Blaine to the cabinet, and Conkling's Stalwart faction became irked at their lack of control over patronage, even in Conkling's home state of New York. Garfield appointed William H. Robertson, a civil service reform supporter, to the most lucrative government post in New York, and refused to withdraw the nomination despite Conkling's protests; in response, Conkling and his allies brought all legislative action in the closely divided Senate to a halt. In May, Conkling and fellow New York Senator Thomas C. Platt resigned from the Senate in protest. The two Stalwarts expected the New York legislature to reelect them in triumph; instead, the legislature deadlocked for months, eventually declining to return either <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Senate. Before that result was known, however, tragedy struck as Charles Guiteau, a mentally unstable man disappointed at being unable to secure a patronage appointment, shot Garfield on July 2, 1881.|$|E

5|$|Luttrell stumbles upon a {{small body}} of water and submerges himself, only to find upon {{surfacing}} that a local Pashtun villager, Mohammad Gulab, has discovered his location. Gulab takes Luttrell into his care, returning to his village, where he attempts to hide Luttrell in his home. Gulab then sends a mountain <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearest American air base to alert military forces to Luttrell's location. The Taliban fighters arrive at the village to capture and kill Luttrell, but Gulab and the villagers intervene, threatening to kill the fighters if they harm Luttrell. The fighters leave, but later return to punish the villagers for protecting Luttrell. Gulab and his fellow militia are able to fend off several fighters during the ensuing attack.

5|$|The few {{men who had}} {{not been}} wounded because they were manning the ships during the battle were {{reinforced}} with three men who had suffered relatively minor wounds; they put ashore at a remote beach to dig for water. They found some and brought it back to the ships, although it sickened those who drank it. The two ships sailed through a storm for two days and nights; Alaminos, the pilot, then steered a course for Florida, where they found good drinking water, although they lost one <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local Indians and another drank so much water that he died. The ships finally made port in Cuba, where Hernández de Cordóba wrote a report to Governor Velázquez describing the voyage, the cities, the plantations, and, most importantly, the discovery of gold. Hernández died soon after from his wounds. The two captured Maya survived the voyage to Cuba and were interrogated; they swore that there was abundant gold in Yucatán.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with an}} open shot of an {{airplane}} flying surrounded by many doves, referencing the works of Hong Kong director John Woo. Spears appears with blond hair dressed as a flight attendant, receiving a phone call. After serving some of the passengers, she leads a middle aged overweight <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bathroom and seduces him. She peels off the man's mask to reveal an attractive man (Matthew Felker) hiding underneath it and steals a black pass from his pocket when they resume kissing. Spears is then dropped {{into the back of}} a Ducati 999, driven by a shirtless male (Tyson Beckford) in a futuristic Paris, that was compared to the 1982 film Blade Runner. She wears a tight black catsuit and sports red hair, inspired by the character of Sydney Bristow from television series Alias. They pass a woman and lift up her dress, a homage to the iconic Marilyn Monroe scene in the 1955 film The Seven Year Itch. They also pass two women frolicking in a store window.|$|E
5|$|Unlike English common law, Chinese law {{held the}} community, {{rather than the}} individual, {{responsible}} for transgressions. Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu demanded {{the death of the}} culprit and was prepared to accept any sailor, whether innocent or guilty, to settle the matter. On 12 August, under an Act of Parliament of 1833, Elliot began a Court of Criminal and Admiralty Jurisdiction on board the Fort William in Hong Kong harbour, with himself as judge and a group of merchants as the jury. Two men were found guilty of rioting, fined £15 each, and sentenced to three months hard labour to be served in England while a further three men were found guilty of assault and rioting, fined £25 each, and sentenced to six months imprisonment in similar conditions. However, the Act was under review and after arriving in England, they were set free {{on the grounds that the}} trial held no jurisdiction. Elliot invited Lin to send observers to the trial, but none came. Without the handover of a <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chinese, Lin was not satisfied with the proceedings. He viewed the extraterritorial court as an infringement of China's sovereignty.|$|E
