5|$|In {{an effort}} to diversify the economy and make it less {{dependent}} on export goods, the government has pushed to increase tourism to Malaysia. As a result, tourism has become Malaysia's third largest source of foreign exchange, although it is threatened by {{the negative effects of}} the growing industrial economy, with large amounts of air and water pollution along with deforestation affecting tourism. The tourism sector came under some pressure in 2014 when the national carrier Malaysia Airlines had one of its planes disappear in March, while another was brought down by a missile over Ukraine in July, resulting in the loss of a total 537 passengers and crew. The state of the airline, which had been unprofitable for 3 years, prompted the government in August 2014 to nationalise the airline by buying up the 30 per cent it did not already own. Between 2013 and 2014, Malaysia has been listed {{as one of the best}} places to retire to in the world, with the country in third position on the Global Retirement Index. This in part was the result of the Malaysia <b>My</b> <b>Second</b> Home programme to allow foreigners to live in the country on a long-stay visa for up to 10 years. In 2016, Malaysia ranked the fifth position on The World's Best Retirement Havens while getting in the first place as the best place in Asia to retire. Warm climate with British colonial background made foreigners easy to interact with the locals.|$|E

25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} with some of my friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave <b>my</b> <b>second</b> elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E

500|$|Ornstein's {{follow-up}} performance {{provoked a}} near-riot: [...] "At <b>my</b> <b>second</b> concert, devoted {{to my own}} compositions, I might have played anything. I couldn't hear the piano myself. The crowd whistled and howled and even threw handy missiles on the stage." [...] The reaction, however, {{was by no means}} universally negative—the Musical Standard called him [...] "one of the most remarkable composers of the day... that germ of realism and humanity which is indicative of genius." [...] By the next year, he was the talk of the American music scene for his performances of cutting-edge works by Schoenberg, Scriabin, Bartók, Debussy, Kodály, Ravel, and Stravinsky (many of them U.S. premieres), as well as his own, even more radical compositions.|$|E
500|$|A {{charter of}} 831, which Wiglaf calls [...] "the {{first year of}} <b>my</b> <b>second</b> reign", was issued at Wychbold near Droitwich; it is {{significant}} that Wiglaf makes no reference to any overlordship of Egbert's in this charter, issued within a year of his recovery of power, and that he acknowledges his temporary deposition. In East Anglia, King Æthelstan minted coins, possibly as early as 827, but more likely c. 830 after Egbert's influence was reduced with Wiglaf's return to power in Mercia. [...] This demonstration of independence on East Anglia's part is not surprising, as it was probably Æthelstan who was responsible for the defeat and death of both Beornwulf and Ludeca.|$|E

Allen also produced two mixtapes titled My First Mixtape and <b>My</b> <b>Second</b> Mixtape to promote her work, including tracks by the band Creedence Clearwater Revival, and rapper Dizzee Rascal, and Ludacris. As she accumulated tens of thousands of MySpace friends, The Observer Music Monthly (OMM), a magazine published in The Observer, took interest. Few people outside of her label's A department had heard of Allen, so the label were slow in responding to publications who wanted to report about her.|$|E

500|$|Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste {{magazine}} wrote {{highly of}} the episode and called it [...] "a half hour of heartwarming comedy". She was particularly pleased with how Michael was able to overcome Oscar with pathos, and she enjoyed the episode's subplots. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic praised the episode and awarded it five stars out of five. He wrote that [...] "If my favorite thing for Jim to do is prank Dwight, <b>my</b> <b>second</b> favorite is when he backs Michael." [...] Furthermore, he wrote that [...] "While this A story was filled with plenty of laughs, [...] Dwight's B story was absolutely murderous [...] all gold".

500|$|Also, {{promptly}} {{after the}} war started, she attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals {{to the war effort}} but the French National Bank refused to accept them. [...] She did buy war bonds, using her Nobel Prize money. She said:I am going to give up the little gold I possess. [...] I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are quite useless to me. There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for <b>my</b> <b>second</b> Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns. This is the chief part of what we possess. I should like to bring it back here and invest it in war loans. The state needs it. Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost.

The concept for the video was [...] "high-end erotica".

It's really stylish and really beautiful... It's the most choreographed thing I've ever done, because usually I just {{get up there and}} screw around. But with Rihanna, it's completely different and so cool." [...] In response, Rihanna continued to say that [...] "I don't do a lot of videos where I have so much chemistry with the other artist, and this is only <b>my</b> <b>second</b> duet in a video... It's really intense, because you have to work with each other so much. It's new for me, but I'm enjoying it." ...|$|E

[...] To reflect his transition into adulthood and the changes in his music, Songz changed his appearance by cutting off his trademark braids. Songz also began dressing in more sophisticated attire, trading in sneakers and T-shirts for vests, tailored pants, and [...] "tasteful" [...] shoes. On the appearance change, Songz's mentor, producer, {{and the head of}} Songbook Entertainment, Troy Taylor said, [...] "Trey's from the streets, he's a hood kid. He wasn't glamorous and (didn't have) the finer things in life growing up, [...] He didn't want to lose his street-ism, [...] As he grew into it I think he began to realize, 'Wait a minute, this ain't that bad after all,' and then he got the ladies' opinions." ...|$|E
500|$|Al Jean {{was born}} Alfred Ernest Jean III on January 9, 1961. He {{was born and}} raised in Farmington Hills, Michigan, {{graduated}} from Farmington Hills Harrison High School, and is of Irish ancestry. Jean arrived at Harvard University when he was sixteen years old and graduated in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. Daryl Libow, one of Jean's freshman roommates, said he was a [...] "math whiz" [...] when he arrived at Harvard but [...] "soon blossomed and found his comedic feet." [...] In Holworthy Hall at Harvard, Jean met fellow freshman Mike Reiss; they befriended one another and collaborated their writing efforts for the humor publication Harvard Lampoon. Jeff Martin, another writer for the Lampoon, said [...] "they definitely loomed large around the magazine. They were very funny guys and unusually polished comedy writers for that age. We were never surprised that they went on to success." [...] Jean has also stated that the duo spent most of their time at the Lampoon, adding that [...] "it was practically <b>my</b> <b>second</b> dorm room." [...] He eventually became vice-president of the publication.|$|E
500|$|The raid {{did not go}} as planned. Standard {{procedure}} was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women {{to the bathroom to}} verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room {{in the back of the}} bar. Maria Ritter, then known as Steve to her family, recalled, [...] "My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. <b>My</b> <b>second</b> biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!"
