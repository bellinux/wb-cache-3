5|$|Carl and Ellie grow up, {{get married}} {{and live in the}} {{restored}} house. Carl sells toy balloons at the zoo where Ellie works. After she suffers a miscarriage and they are told they cannot have a child, the two decide to realize their dream of visiting Paradise Falls. They save for the trip, but repeatedly have to spend the money on <b>more</b> <b>pressing</b> needs. Finally, the now elderly Carl arranges for the trip, but Ellie falls ill and dies.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1950s, the radical reform of local {{government}} in Wales was considered <b>more</b> <b>pressing</b> than that in England, due to {{the small size of}} many of the existing authorities, especially the upper tier county councils. The Local Government Commission for Wales set up in 1958 was the first to recommend wholesale amalgamation of the administrative counties outside Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, with extensive boundary changes; however the then Minister of Housing and Local Government Sir Keith Joseph decided not to accept the report, noting that county amalgamations in England had been highly unpopular when proposed.|$|E
5|$|Since June 2009, {{when two}} Red Line trains {{collided}} and killed nine people {{due in part}} to malfunctions in the ATC system, all Metro trains have been manually operated. The current state of manual operation has led to heavily degraded service, with new manual requirements such as absolute blocks, speed restrictions, and end-of-platform stopping leading to increased headways between trains, increased dwell time, and worse on-time performance. Metro originally planned to have all trains be automated again by 2017, but those plans were shelved in early 2017 in order to focus on <b>more</b> <b>pressing</b> safety and infrastructure issues.|$|E

5000|$|Having {{released}} {{a cover of}} Them's [...] "I Can Only Give You Everything" [...] backed with original composition [...] "One of the Guys" [...] on the tiny AMG label over a year earlier, in early 1968 their second single was released by Trans-Love Energies on A-Square records (though without the knowledge of that label's owner Jeep Holland). Housed in a striking picture sleeve, it comprised two original songs: [...] "Borderline" [...] and [...] "Looking at You". The first pressing sold out in a few weeks, and by year's end it had gone through <b>more</b> <b>pressings</b> totaling several thousand copies. A third single that coupled [...] "I Can Only Give You Everything" [...] with the original [...] "I Just Don't Know" [...] appeared {{at about the same}} time on the AMG label, as well.|$|R
5|$|The first {{discussion}} of a bridge in a public forum was in 1954, when Anton P. Torsvik proposed a bridge to the major and municipal engineer of Fjell. Torsvik lived in Oslo and had worked with public relations for various other bridge projects. The issue was discussed in the municipal councils of Fjell and Sund, but they both concluded that there were <b>more</b> <b>pressing</b> needs on the islands' road network, so {{they did not want}} to prioritize a bridge. National Road 555 was completed in 1957, and the following years various road projects were completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I largely halted the dreadnought arms race as funds and technical resources were diverted to <b>more</b> <b>pressing</b> priorities. The foundries which produced battleship guns were dedicated {{instead to the}} production of land-based artillery, and shipyards were flooded with orders for small ships. The weaker naval powers engaged in the Great War—France, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Russia—suspended their battleship programmes entirely. The United Kingdom and Germany continued building battleships and battlecruisers but at a reduced pace.|$|E
5|$|Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of Civilization II, {{was invited}} to join {{development}} as a game balancer. Reynolds cited the Alpha Centauris balance for the greater sense of urgency and the <b>more</b> <b>pressing</b> pacing than in his earlier game, Sid Meier's Colonization. According to producer Timothy Train, in designing {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the factions, the goal was to suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing the game. He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant over the rest. Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.|$|E

50|$|The {{instrument}} is tuned by mechanics hidden {{on the right}} side of the yatga. After basic tuning, the {{instrument is}} fine-tuned by moving the bridges to either side. The player can vary the pitch or a note by one half tone or <b>more</b> when <b>pressing</b> down on the strings to the left of the bridges.|$|R
40|$|With today's {{high-level}} plan languages like GOLOG or rpl it {{is possible}} for mobile robots to cope with complex problems. Unfortunately, instructing the robot what to do or interacting with it is still awkward. Usually, instructions are given by loading the appropriate program and interacting amounts to little <b>more</b> than <b>pressing</b> buttons positioned on the robot itself...|$|R
5|$|In April 1898, Schwalbe was recommissioned {{for another}} tour abroad. She first {{returned}} to German East Africa, where the Second Boer War threatened regional stability; British warships began seizing German vessels suspected of carrying contraband to the Boers. This created a major diplomatic incident and Schwalbe {{was sent to}} protect German shipping in the area. The outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion in Qing China in 1900 proved to be <b>more</b> <b>pressing,</b> and so Schwalbe was sent to join the Eight Nation Alliance that had formed to crush the Boxers. During her deployment to China, she helped blockade the Yangtze and sent landing parties ashore to control unrest in Ningpo. In mid-1902, she was recalled to Germany for a second time, was overhauled, and was again decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|The Tupolev Tu-70 (NATO {{reporting}} name: Cart) was a Soviet passenger {{variant of}} the Tu-4 bomber (which was a reverse-engineered copy of the American-made Boeing B-29 Superfortress) designed immediately {{after the end of}} World War II. It used a number of components from Boeing B-29s that had made emergency landings in the Soviet Union after running out of fuel after bombing Japan. It had the first pressurized fuselage in the Soviet Union and first flew on 27 November 1946. The aircraft was successfully tested, recommended for serial production, but ultimately not produced because of <b>more</b> <b>pressing</b> military orders and because Aeroflot had no requirement for such an aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was further aggravated {{by the absence}} of a clear successor, made <b>more</b> <b>pressing</b> because of Nerva's old age and sickness. He had no natural children of his own and only distant relatives, who were unsuited for political office. A successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals in the Empire and it appears that, by 97, Nerva was considering to adopt Marcus Cornelius Nigrinus Curiatius Maternus, the powerful governor of Syria. This was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander Marcus Ulpius Traianus, commonly known as Trajan, a general of the armies at the German frontier.|$|E
5000|$|As part of {{this project}} came a spend of [...] to upgrade the Elizabeth plant, which saw a 43 percent {{increase}} in robots (to a total of 130), <b>more</b> efficient <b>pressing</b> process (with 59 presses instead of 104) and welding (that sees the main body spot-welded in 101 seconds), reducing the VT's final assembly time by 2.5 hours.|$|R
50|$|After {{fermentation}} {{comes the}} pressing. Bordeaux, {{along with other}} regions, has switched from horizontal presses to the pneumatic press, where a pneumatic bladder filled with air results in a <b>more</b> gentle <b>pressing</b> of the wine. A third type of press is the vertical or hydraulic press. This is the most traditional, and also a gentle, type of press. However, is a very labour-intensive process.|$|R
50|$|Other left {{organizations}} ridiculed this policy, {{and it did}} {{not receive}} wide support from African Americans, either in the urban north or in the South. They had <b>more</b> immediate, <b>pressing</b> problems and the CPUSA had little foothold. While the party continued to give lip service to the goal of national self-determination for blacks, particularly in its theoretical writings, it largely ignored that demand in its practical work.|$|R
5|$|Kublai's {{absence from}} the war front was seen by Chancellor Jia Sidao as an opportune moment, so he ordered to resume armed conflict. The Song army routed the small armed {{detachment}} that Kublai had stationed south of the Yangzi, and the Song regained its lost territory. With his ally Hulagu busy fighting the Golden Horde and his own forces needed in the north against the rival Khagan claimant Ariq Böke, Kublai was unable to focus on hostilities in the south. On May 21, 1260, Kublai sent his envoy Hao Jing and two other advisors {{to negotiate with the}} Southern Song. Upon their arrival and attempts to solve the conflict through diplomatic means, Jia Sidao ordered Kublai's embassy to be detained. Although Kublai would not forget this slight of imprisoning his ambassadors, he nonetheless had to focus on <b>more</b> <b>pressing</b> affairs with the threat of his brother and rival Khan. From 1260 to 1262 the Song forces raided Kublai's southern border which forced Kublai to retaliate with some minor incursions until 1264, when his brother finally surrendered and ended the civil war. In 1265 the first major battle in five years erupted in Sichuan province, where Kublai gained a preliminary victory and considerable war booty of 146 Song naval ships.|$|E
5|$|While {{food was}} {{extremely}} {{hard to come}} by, an even <b>more</b> <b>pressing</b> need was obtaining drinking water. Thirst {{and the search for}} water are mentioned in most of the Robinsons' memoirs. The most common sources originally included toilet cisterns, boilers, and standing water found inside bathtubs. As these ran out, those in hiding were forced to risk sneaking access to wells, which were often guarded by German soldiers. Some memoirs describe long periods observing a particular well and waiting for a chance to obtain a quick drink. Another method involved obtaining polluted sewer water from the canals, and then filtering it through coals wrapped in rags. Generally, records indicate that whatever scant water supplies existed were shared fairly among individuals hiding as a group. In at least one instance, one person was unable to withstand the thirst and drank the whole group's water supply. As a result, Jakub Wiśnia, a former Gęsiówka inmate and after its liberation, a Home Army soldier, was court-martialed by his fellow group members and sentenced to death. The execution was to be postponed until after liberation, but when that occurred, the Robinsons were so overwhelmed with joy, the crime was forgiven and the sentence was never mentioned again.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{had arrived}} off the Cape on 26 July with no {{knowledge}} of Elphinstone's dispositions. He had <b>more</b> <b>pressing</b> concerns: it had been several months since his ships had sighted land and his supplies of drinking water were running dangerously low. A significant proportion of his crews were suffering from disease and {{he had decided to}} send these men to an encampment ashore to allow for better treatment. Lucas even ordered that the sails on his ships be removed for repairs, rendering his ships temporarily immobile. On 9 August, Lucas was warned by a servant of a Dutch inhabitant of the Cape that a superior English force was present. He was informed that the Dutch population would not assist an attack on the British and strongly advised to sail away. Lucas however, on hearing this sailed deeper into the bay. Sir James Craig sent cavalry to Saldanha Bay to harry Batavian shore parties and organised the withdrawal of the local population and livestock to prevent their capture, following with a larger force under his own command. Lucas held a council with his senior officers, debating whether an attack on Cape Town was practical or whether they should abandon the operation. By 16 August the decision had been made to sail for Île de France, but Lucas delayed, unwilling to leave his sick men ashore.|$|E
50|$|The keypad lock feature {{found on}} most mobile phones is {{intended}} to help prevent accidental dialing, but is often so trivial that the keypad is easily pocket-unlocked. Sometimes the unlock sequence requires nothing <b>more</b> than <b>pressing</b> a button and then applying a random swiping motion to the screen, {{or in the case}} of some keypad phones, it sometimes requires nothing more than holding a particular key for several seconds.|$|R

5|$|Schirra gave {{a public}} lecture at Rice University after {{returning}} to Houston, where he received a motorcade through the city. However, the Cuban Missile Crisis had been steadily escalating through September, and helped drive discussion of Schirra's successful flight down the news schedules; public concern about the relative effectiveness of Soviet and American space launchers was displaced by a <b>more</b> <b>pressing</b> concern over Soviet military rockets. He visited Washington, D.C., to receive the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President Kennedy on October 16, the same day Kennedy had first seen U-2 photographs of missile sites in Cuba; the meeting was friendly and informal despite the circumstances. Robert Kennedy, Schirra later noted, took him aside and sounded him out about a potential political career, {{the same way he}} had sounded out John Glenn a year earlier. Unlike Glenn, however, Schirra politely turned the suggestion down, and chose to remain with NASA. His later career saw him commanding the backup crew for the first Gemini mission, then the prime crew for the 1965 Gemini 6A mission, where he flew the first active rendezvous between two spacecraft - earlier plans for it to conduct the first on-orbit docking had been cancelled - and finally commanding the first Apollo mission, Apollo 7, in 1968. He retired from NASA in the summer of 1969, the only astronaut to fly on Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.|$|E

50|$|Pressureless {{sintering}} is the sintering of {{a powder}} compact (sometimes {{at very high}} temperatures, depending on the powder) without applied pressure. This avoids density variations in the final component, which occurs with <b>more</b> traditional hot <b>pressing</b> methods.|$|R

25|$|Securing {{access to}} {{resources}} and energy.

25|$|Scientific and {{technological}} {{development in the}} South Korea at first did not occur largely because of <b>more</b> <b>pressing</b> matters such as the division of Korea and the Korean War that occurred right after its independence. It wasn't until the 1960s under the dictatorship of Park Chung-hee where South Korea's economy rapidly grew from industrialisation and the Chaebol corporations such as Samsung and LG.|$|E
2500|$|The games {{often make}} {{light of the fact}} that the tasks Gordon {{performs}} amount to little more than manual labor, despite his qualifications. Gordon's assigned job at the start of Half-Life consists of little <b>more</b> than <b>pressing</b> a button and pushing a cart. Barney Calhoun wryly notes this irony at the beginning of Half-Life 2, when Freeman performs similar [...] "technical" [...] assistance by flipping a switch and returning a plug to its socket.|$|R
