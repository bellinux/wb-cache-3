Triple H had interfered {{in one of}} The Rock's matches, and later threw him off the stage. The script called for The Rock to portray an injury to his arm that required him to wear a plaster cast. Shane, acting his role as co-owner of WWF and ally of Triple H, further aggrieved The Rock by forbidding him to wear the cast for Over the Edge.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon becomes {{friends with}} a new student, a Mexican {{immigrant}} named Pedro Sánchez (Efren Ramirez) who rarely conveys emotion or speaks. Pedro runs for class president after seeing a poster at the school dance. On the election day, he gives a mediocre speech {{in front of the}} student body. Napoleon does a dance routine as Pedro's skit for the election and receives a standing ovation, saving the campaign and winning Pedro the election. Following the campaign, Kip and Lafawnduh <b>meet</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> real life and are wed. Jared Hess has stated that the series takes place before the marriage, but after Pedro's election, and several new characters are introduced.|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Rahman {{supported}} {{the work of}} the Legislative Assembly which began in December 1948. He saw it as the first time that Sudan's political and religious groups had been able to <b>meet</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> a venue where the British could not stir up disputes between the different factions. He said that Isma'il al-Azhari opposed the Assembly purely because it would bring Sudan away from Egypt and nearer to full independence. In December 1950 a member of the Umma tabled a resolution asking the Governor-General to demand that Egypt and Britain grant Sudan independence at once. The British strongly opposed the measure, saying the Assembly was not truly representative since the Khatmiyya had chosen not to participate. The resolution was passed by one vote. Abd al-Rahman and al-Azhari both claimed victory: Abd al-Rahman since the vote had been passed, and the al-Azhari since the British had said the Assembly was not representative.|$|E

25|$|There is also {{inconsistency}} as {{to whether}} the Doctor can recognise his own future incarnations. In the original series, the Doctors usually have no difficulty recognising one another (in The Three Doctors, the First, Second, and Third Doctors all know one another on sight. However, in The Five Doctors, the First Doctor does not recognise the Fifth Doctor as himself and needs to be introduced by the Fifth as his fourth regeneration. In Time Crash, after the TARDIS is at different points in its own timeline merge due to downed shields, the Fifth Doctor spends much of the mini-episode believing that the Tenth was merely a fan who had somehow gotten into his TARDIS, having somehow altered the 'desktop theme'; the Tenth Doctor constantly tries to convince his younger self that he is his future self, only doing so by using a predestination paradox to cancel out a universe-destroying black hole with a supernova by blowing up the TARDIS. When the Tenth and the Eleventh Doctor <b>meet</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> The Day Of The Doctor, the Tenth Doctor appears to sceptically recognise his successor, yet he appears to be fully convinced only after both compare their respective sonic screwdrivers. The War Doctor on the other hand is initially completely oblivious to meet two of his future regenerations (initially mistaking them for future companions), again being convinced by their sonic screwdrivers.|$|E
