[...] Blair reciprocated in describing Thatcher as a [...] "thoroughly determined person, and that is an admirable quality".|$|E

60|$|February 24.--Snowy miserable morning. I {{corrected}} my proofs, {{but had no}} time {{to write}} anything. We, i.e. myself and the two Annes, went to breakfast with Mr. Drummond Hay, where we again met Colonel and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Blair,</b> with Thomas Thomson. We looked over some most beautiful drawings[260] which <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Blair</b> had made in different parts of India, exhibiting a species of architecture so gorgeous, and on a scale so extensive, as to put to shame the magnificence of Europe. And yet, in most cases, as little is known of the people who wrought these wonders as of the kings who built the Pyramids. Fame depends on literature, not on architecture. We are more eager to see a broken column of Cicero's villa, than all those mighty labours of barbaric power. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Blair</b> is full of enthusiasm. She told me that when she worked with her pencil she was glad to have some one to read to her as a sort of sedative, otherwise her excitement made her tremble, and burst out a-crying. I can understand this very well, having often found the necessity of doing two things at once. She is a very pretty, dark woman too, and has been compared to Rebecca, daughter of the Jew, Isaac of York.|$|R

2500|$|Farage is {{critical}} of Britain's involvement in the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, and cited their financial and human expenses and poor outcomes as reasons for Britain to not become involved militarily in Syria. He has expressed fears that rebel forces in Syria may be Islamic extremists.

Farage stated that migrant exodus from Libya had been caused by NATO military intervention, approved by David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy, in the civil war in Libya.|$|E
