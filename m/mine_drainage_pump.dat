50|$|As {{was common}} for <b>mine</b> <b>drainage,</b> <b>pumping</b> at one pit could drain water across {{a number of}} pits. The water {{produced}} was used to maintain water levels in the Ashton Canal by draining into the Fairbottom Branch Canal at Fennyfield Bridge, {{just south of the}} engine. In 1801 the canal company was approached to contribute to the costs of its refurbishment, work that may have been carried out by Bateman and Sherratt engine builders of Manchester. The original pit appears to have been worked out in the 1820s, although others nearby were working as 'Fairbottom Pits'. Draining the old mine workings and supplying water to the canal kept the engine working after the Cannel Colliery closed until the engine was abandoned in 1826 or 1827.|$|R

40|$|International audienceCoal {{extraction}} in the Lorraine coal field {{ended in}} 2004, after 150 years of mining. Stopping of <b>mine</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>pumping</b> caused the flooding of 180 million m 3 of mine cavities. After around 2 to 5 years of filling, pumping became {{necessary to keep}} pace with rising levels of iron‐containing water. The elevated levels of iron mineralisation in the mine water are such that the water cannot be discharged directly into the natural environment, making treatment a necessity. In the Lorraine coal field, the complete treatment system will comprise three treatment plants with a maximum cumulative flow rate estimated at 1, 000 m 3 /h. The plants are of the passive type with the mine water flowing over aeration cascades into settling tanks and lagoons planted with reeds, before being discharged into the natural environment. Two plants are currently operating, one since 2009 the other since 2012. The La Houve plant, in operation since 2009, has provided experience over three years and this feedback enables a comparison with initial predictions. The first results show that the model for decrease in the iron concentration of the mine water used initially does not fit with the La Houve case. We have formulated a hypothesis allowing adjustment of the model to observations; other phenomena remain to be studied to explain the behaviour of the mine reservoir. Where treatment plant efficiency is concerned, 98 per cent of iron is removed on average and there is a seasonal pattern...|$|R

Sulfide rich and carbonate poor materials are expected to produce acidic drainage, and alkaline rich materials, even with significant sulfide concentrations, often produce net alkaline water. 	<b>Mine</b> <b>drainages</b> are dangerous because pollutants may decompose in the environment. In certain conditions metals can be concentrated in environmental, and by others can be dispersed. 	Two methods can treat <b>mine</b> <b>drainage</b> to eliminate or reduce contamination by acidity and heavy metals.

30|$|To {{verify the}} effect of pH on Daphnia manga, a {{toxicity}} test was conducted, with the calculated LC 50 being 4.35  ±  0.04. Previous research reported that the mortality of Daphnia magna could dramatically increase below pH 3.7 (Walton et al. 1982), and previous research (Alibone and Fair 1981; France 1982) already reported that acid pH (high concentration of hydrogen ion) directly affects the growth of Daphnia magna. In both metal mine and coal <b>mine</b> <b>drainage,</b> DS- 3 and ST- 4 demonstrated the extremely higher TU even though the metal concentration is lower than metal-rich <b>mine</b> <b>drainage</b> (DS- 1). This is because the <b>mine</b> <b>drainage</b> is accompanied strongly acidic pH (pH <  3.3) with metal concentration. The acidic pH involves both the toxicity of hydrogen ions and metal activity, therefore the acid pH could be a key factor to determine the toxicity of <b>mine</b> <b>drainage.</b> Generally, the toxicity of metal <b>mine</b> <b>drainage</b> had a higher toxicity than coal mines because the toxic heavy metals entering the environment by acidic pH enhances the mobility of minerals (Gäbler 1997). However, the strongly acidic pH could be the variable factor {{even though there is}} similar concentration in <b>mine</b> <b>drainage.</b>|$|R

On the basis of analyzing the theories, the protective sleeve and the base of the temperature sensor are designed to measure the water temperature at inlet and outlet of the pump. The efficiencies of pumps with two specifications are measured, respectively, by using the thermodynamic method and ultrasonic flowmeter method. By contrast, the results show that thermodynamic method can satisfy the precision of the testing requirements accuracy for high-flow and high-lift <b>drainage</b> <b>pump</b> under normal temperatures.
