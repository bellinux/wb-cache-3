5000|$|Harry Bickerton (1922-1994?) was a British {{engineer}} {{in the fields}} of aerospace engineering, aircraft engine design, and bicycle construction and design. He became a household name in the UK in the early 1980s after a successful TV campaign advertising the Bickerton (bicycle), a folding bicycle that he originally designed in the 1970s and perfected over time. In the mid-1970s, The British Central Office of Information released a film, presenting the Bickerton Portable {{as a symbol of the}} British lifestyle while simultaneously extolling its technological advantages ("The smallest bike in the world").Harry Bickerton's bicycle design became equally seminal as Alex Moulton's, and eventually inspired Andrew Ritchie to create the Brompton bicycle.Harry Bickerton's achievements go well beyond the bicycle for which he is best known.

After transfers to Glasgow and being seconded to RAE Farnborough to work for Tilly Shilling, where they worked on water <b>methanol</b> <b>injection</b> and exhaust pipe tuning amongst other things for the Rolls Royce 'Merlin' engine of the Spitfire fighter plane. After World War II, Bickerton, now a seasoned aircraft engineer, moved on to de Havilland where he was Chief Engineer and worked primarily on internal combustion engines (Gypsy Major) but also became involved in the investigation of the De Havilland Comet after a series of failures. He later re-designed the Gypsy Major engine for Britain's first helicopter - The Skeeter, and headed the development of extreme cold weather starting for an Antarctic expedition by air. He also filed a patent for a Rotary Engine design whilst at DeHavilland. Bickerton eventually left the industry in the late 1950s to become a free-lance engineer and inventor. Some of his other projects were a self-adjustable posture bed, which was adopted for use by the National Health Service, and an economical centrifuge (called a Hermatocit) for separating red and white blood cells, designed for use with a car battery in remote locations like Africa.Harry Bickerton's engineering principles, expressed in ten [...] "Performance specifications for a new portable human-powered personal transport device" [...] (1971) are still valid today.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{compound}} combustion of DME and methanol was {{realized in}} a four-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine by introducing {{a certain amount}} of DME into the manifold and injecting methanol into the cylinder using the injection system of the original engine. The effects of <b>methanol</b> <b>injection</b> timing and equivalence ratios of methanol and DME on the emissions characteristics of the compound combustion mode were experimental studied. The results showed that: <b>methanol</b> <b>injection</b> timing has greater impact on the emissions of compound combustion mode. When methanol is injected before 65 ºCABTDC, the engine shows HCCI combustion characteristics, the range of DME equivalence ratio is narrowed and the emission of HC is higher. When methanol is injected at 25 ºCABTDC, NOx emission amount is larger, while the HC and CO emission are lower. As <b>Methanol</b> <b>injection</b> timing is delayed to 5 ºCABTDC, CO emission increases sharply, but NOx and HC emissions are very low and not susceptible to the equivalence ratio of DME and methanol. Therefore, reasonable selection of <b>methanol</b> <b>injection</b> timing is the key to reducing the emissions of compound combustion mode...|$|E

40|$|A facile {{synthetic}} route for {{the preparation of}} highly active photocatalysts was developed. The protocol involves the preparation of a photocatalyst through the direct injection of metal alkoxide precursors into solutions in a photoreactor. As a proof of concept, a tantalum oxide based photocatalyst was chosen as a model system. Tantalum ethoxide [Ta(OEt) 5] was injected rapidly into a photoreactor filled with a water/methanol mixture, and a TaO x (OH) y composite formed {{and was able to}} produce hydrogen under light illumination. Compared to commercial and mesostructured Ta 2 O 5 and NaTaO 3 materials, TaO x (OH) y produced by direct injection shows superior hydrogen production activity. Notably, the samples prepared by direct injection are amorphous; however, their photocatalytic performance is much higher than those of their crystalline equivalents. If Ta(OEt) 5 was dispersed in <b>methanol</b> before <b>injection,</b> an amorphous framework with higher surface area and larger pore volume was formed, and the hydrogen production rate increased further. The addition of a sodium precursor during the injection further boosted the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, this concept has also been applied to a titanium-based photocatalyst, and a much better hydrogen production rate has been obtained in comparison with that of commercial TiO 2 (P 25 -Degussa); therefore, the direct-injection synthesis is a flexible method that opens the door to the facile preparation of highly active nanostructured photocatalysts for hydrogen production...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} pollution and depleting fossil fuels {{have been considered}} as a critical issue all over the world. Many efforts have been devoted to investigating alternative fuels to tackle these problems. Alcohol fuels are potential candidates to alternative energy as it can mitigate pollutant emission. In addition, alcohol fuels {{can be applied to}} current diesel engines with technical modifications. This thesis mainly focuses on the effects of methanol fuel on in-cylinder process in premixed dual fuel engine. Different fuel ratios were tested to investigate the effects of methanol fuel. Existing diesel engine models, which have been developed by TU delft, were used to conduct computer simulations. To describe dual fuel combustion, separated vibe functions were adopted in the existing models. The simulation results indicated that the cooling effect caused by high heat of evaporation of methanol affected in-cylinder processes. With increase of <b>methanol</b> <b>injection,</b> start of ignition delayed due to the cooling effect. The longer ignition delay improved premixing of pilot fuel and it led to higher heat release rates. In case of maximum temperature, it was affected by both the cooling effects and diesel injection timing. With advanced diesel injection timing (- 5. 5 TDC), maximum temperature of dual fuel mode was higher than only diesel mode due to strong premixed combustion. Due to the lower LHV of methanol fuel, brake specific fuel consumption became higher with increase of <b>methanol</b> <b>injection.</b> Brake thermal efficiency decreased with increase of <b>methanol</b> <b>injection</b> due to lower combustion efficiency. The current models are not able to differentiate different combustion durations for diesel and methanol fuels. Further developments of the models are recommended to increase simulation accuracy. Furthermore, simulation on different diesel injection timing is recommended to better understand methanol combustion.

30|$|Furthermore, volume {{determination}} {{in general}} is difficult as injection volumes are in pico- to nanoliter range. Here, an object micrometer {{was used for the}} volume identification. Depending on the micrometer scale, volume determination is more or less accurate. It comprises a high-error risk. Differences in droplet diameter of 10  μm lead to approximately 10 % differences in calculated injection volumes. To further reduce the high-error risk, it may be reasonable to use a micrometer with an even smaller scale. Due to the rapid development of a zebrafish egg [35] and therefore for time saving as well as practical reasons, we determined the injection volume prior and past a series of 40 to 60 injections of one vehicle in a droplet of mineral oil spotted on the micrometer scale [36]. Hence, volume oscillations between single injections were not observed. Probably the best way to circumvent this effect is to measure the diameter of the injected droplet inside the egg. But this is not feasible for any vehicle. A distinct injection droplet {{in the shape of a}} sphere was only visible after triolein administration. The droplets appearing after DMSO, <b>methanol,</b> or water <b>injection</b> were rather diffuse. They had either no distinct shape or appeared as several small injection droplets within the yolk.

To improve the sensitivity further, electrokinetic supercharging (EKS) was examined. The optimum EKS method involved hydrodynamic injection leading electrolyte (100 mM NaCl, 30 s, 50 mbar), electrokinetic injection of the sample (200 s, − 10 kV) and finally injection of the terminating electrolyte (100 mM 2 -(cyclohexylamino) ethanesulphonic acid, CHES, 40 s, 50 mbar). With this method, the sensitivity was improved by 2400 -fold giving detection limits of 50 – 180 ng/L. The developed method was validated and then applied to the analysis of wastewater samples from a local sewage treatment plant. The detection limits were found to increase by approximately 10 -fold, however, this is still lower than levels previously found in wastewater samples from European and Mediterranean cities.

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{success of}} oil recovery, by water flooding, in {{naturally}} fractured, low permeable limestone reservoirs strictly depends on imbibition of injected {{water into the}} reservoir matrix block. Prerequisite of imbibition process {{is the presence of}} positive capillary pressure inside the reservoir which {{is directly related to the}} wetting state. In previous experimental studies on surface reactive limestone cores performed by the EOR group in University of Stavanger, two different oil recovery ratios were encountered during spontaneous imbibition tests on the same core after cleaning the core with different solvents. After mild cleaning with kerosene & n-heptane (preserved state) around 40 % of OOIP was recovered indicating that the core behaved preferentially water-wet. On the other hand, after cleaning the same core with toluene and methanol oil recovery was below 10 % indicating that the core was oil-wet. Chromatographic wettability tests were utilized to examine the wetting states inside the cores after mild cleaning with kerosene & n-heptane and after cleaning with toluene and methanol. The results of the tests have shown small changes in water-wet fraction inside the cores indicating infinite small wettability changes due to the adsorbed organic components to the rock surface. It has been concluded that the reason behind this recovery difference is due to successive toluene and <b>methanol</b> <b>injection</b> which removes the water in smaller pores.

Optimum results were obtained with a column Eclipse XDB - C 18 (4. 6 x 150 mm, 5 µm) and a mobile phase comprising glacial acetic acid solution (10 %, v/v) and <b>methanol.</b> <b>Injection</b> volume was set to 10 µml and temperature to 40 ˚C. Other conditions used in methods varied. The first method for benzocaine and EPNB was set to flow rate 2 ml/min, detection time 30 min and mobile phase was carried as a gradient profile programme whereas the second method for PABA was set to flow rate 1 ml/min, detection time 10 min and glacial acetic acid solution and methanol {{in the rate of}} 90 : [...] .

30|$|Survival of triolein-injected {{individuals}} {{showed no}} remarkable {{difference between the}} tested injection volumes. For water, methanol, and DMSO, we found higher survival rates for smaller injection volumes. In general, the injection volume is directly linked to the applied concentration. An increase in volume resulted in a simultaneous increase in dose. However, this is only true for methanol and DMSO, which {{are known to be}} toxic to the fish embryo in higher concentrations [31], but cannot be assumed for water. Water is generally nontoxic to the fish embryo. Hence, smaller injection volumes seem to cause less mortality [14]. However, a smaller injection volume needs less injection pressure and/or a shorter injection time, which appears advantageous at the first sight. But the risk of needle clogging is enhanced at the same time. Volume constancy over a series of injections may therefore not be warranted when low volumes are injected. We observed this effect especially during the <b>injection</b> of low <b>methanol</b> volumes. The <b>injection</b> needle was successively clogging, and an injection droplet was not always visible. Hence, the high survival rate after the injection of 0.5  nL methanol is possibly overestimated. Methanol as a putative vehicle was not tested before in any of the prior studies concerning microinjection as tool for pollutant administration. However, it is used in a few cases as substance carrier for, e.g., perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) [33] and was shown to be tolerated up to a concentration of 2 % by early zebrafish embryos in the Fish Embryo Toxicity Test [31].|$|R
40|$|Stricter {{emission}} requirements {{have led to}} ship operation on low flashpoint fuels, such as liquefied natural gas and methanol. These differ in many ways from traditional fuels (e. g. heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil), but requirements and guidelines for fire detection and extinguishment have been sparse. This was addressed in the proFLASH project, first theoretically and then experimentally. This report documents the experimental part of the project, focusing on methanol, and gives technical guidance for fire detection and extinguishing systems. It was for example concluded that methanol flames exhibit similar radiation to ethanol in the IR spectrum, despite limited observability in the visual spectrum. Approved IR flame detectors (tested against ethanol) are thereby likely suitable to detect methanol fire; tested detectors could even detect fully obstructed methanol fire. The design concentration of carbon dioxide gas fire-extinguishing systems should be increased from 40 % to 55 % {{to achieve the same}} safety margin for methanol as for traditional fuels. The primary extinguishing mechanism of a water-based fire-extinguishing system used against methanol is dilution, but almost 90 % water may be necessary for extinguishment. Furthermore, dilution makes the methanol flames increasingly invisible. It is recommended to use alcohol resistant foam injection with fixed water-based extinguishing systems, since this significantly reduces the time required for extinguishment. The effectiveness of the system depends on the foam/water application rate. Hence, a higher discharge rate is more effective and a concealed pool is difficult to extinguish. In different compartment fire test scenarios, water-spray with foam injection was more effective against methanol than water-spray without foam against standardized fuels. High and low pressure water mist performed better than water spray against standardized fuels but worse against <b>methanol</b> (with foam <b>injection).</b> proFLAS...|$|R
40|$|Ethanol is {{receiving}} great interest {{as an alternative}} fuel. Methanol is another alcohol fuel {{that could serve as}} a replacement for gasoline. Although it is currently receiving much less attention, {{it has the potential to}} play an important role. Like ethanol, methanol also has the advantage of being a liquid fuel and it can be produced from gasification of a variety of feedstocks using well established thermal chemical technology. These feedstocks include coal, natural gas, biomass and various types of waste. This paper discusses the high effective octane number and efficiency advantages of methanol and ethanol when used in direct injection engines. Octane number represents the resistance of a spark ignition engine to knock (unwanted detonation which can damage the engine). The high intrinsic octane numbers of ethanol and methanol are well known. However, a much greater effective octane number can be effectively realized through the knock resistance provided by the high level of vaporization cooling that occurs when methanol or ethanol is directly injected into the engine cylinders. A computational model is used in this paper to determine the knock resistance and effective octane number of these alcohol fuels when they are directly injected. The model indicates that the effective octane numbers are around 160 for ethanol and 180 for methanol. The high compression ratio, high degree of turbocharging and aggressive engine downsizing enabled by the high effective octane number of methanol could provide an efficiency gain of 30 – 35 % (for combined city-highway driving) relative to conventional port fueled gasoline engines. An additional gain of around 10 % can be obtained by using reforming of methanol to enable ultra lean operation at low loads. The combination of these gains could thus potentially provide an efficiency gain of 40 – 45 % for direct <b>injection</b> <b>methanol</b> engines. This efficiency gain is significantly greater than the typical 25 – 30 % gain of turbocharged diesel engines. 3 I...|$|R
