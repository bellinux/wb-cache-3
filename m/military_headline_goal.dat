40|$|Executive summary. CSDP: Strategy Needed. Why does Europe {{develop the}} {{military}} and civilian capabilities that it does? Why does it undertake {{the military and}} civilian operations that it does? And why in other cases does it refrain from action? The {{answers to these questions}} would amount to a civilian-military strategy for the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Starting from the EU’s vital interests, an analysis of the threats and challenges to these interests, and the EU’s foreign policy priorities, a CSDP strategy would outline the priority regions and issues for CSDP and, in function of the long-term political objectives and the appropriate political roadmap for those regions and issues, scenarios in which launching an operation could be appropriate. Without strategy, we can never be sure that the operations that we do are actually the most relevant and important that we could undertake. We cannot direct the operations that we do undertake to achieve the desired strategic effect. And we cannot focus capability development if we do not know our strategic priorities. Many of the building-blocks of a CSDP strategy already exist. What remains to be done is to connect the dots and render explicit: (1) for which priority regions and issues we must plan and prepare, (2) for which possible scenarios that may require a CSDP operation, and (3) identify the implications for our capabilities and a roadmap to meet those requirements. Priority Regions and Issues. The regions and issues on which CSDP ought to focus are those where our vital interests are most directly at stake: • Defence against any military threat to the territory of the Union. • Open lines of communication and trade (in physical as well as in cyber space). • A secure supply of energy and other vital natural resources. • A sustainable environment. • Manageable migration flows. • The maintenance of international law (including the UN Charter and the treaties and regulations of the key international organizations) and of universally agreed rights. • Preserving the autonomy of the decision-making of the EU and its Member States. That {{does not mean that the}} EU will disregard other regions and issues, but it does provide the focus for early warning and prevention, and for permanent contingency planning for: • The Eastern Neighbourhood (the Baltic to the Black Sea). • The Southern Neighbourhood (the Dardanelles to Gibraltar). • The Gulf. • Central Asia. • Sub-Sahara Africa. • Maritime security. • Collective security under the UN, notably the Responsibility to Protect. If the main focus of CSDP is on the external security of the Union, it does have a complementary role to play in our internal security as well, notably in the implementation of the Solidarity Clause, and including perhaps, in the future, in our collective defence. Scenarios for Operations. For the purpose of military planning, as well as to guide military capability development, the EU military bodies have elaborated five illustrative scenarios. These no longer cover all operations that the EU already is undertaking. Five new scenarios ought to be added: • A Maritime Security Scenario. • A Cyber Security Scenario. • A Support Operations Scenario. • A Counter-Terrorism Scenario. • An Internal Security Scenario. Capability Implications. In order to stay in tune with today’s higher level of crisis management activity, the existing <b>military</b> <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> has to be interpreted broadly. The aim to be able to sustain a corps level deployment (50 to 60, 000 troops) for at least one year should be understood as a deployment which EU Member States must be able to undertake at any one time over and above ongoing operations. Then the EU would be able to deal with every eventuality. Generating the necessary capabilities requires an ambitious approach to pooling & sharing, but also to go beyond it and create a Permanent Capability Conference as a durable strategic-level platform for harmonization of national defence planning as such, rather than project-by-project coordination only. With regard to civilian capabilities, achieving the original civilian Headline Goal would already constitute a significant improvement, but there is a lack of implementation and follow-through by the Member States. If decentralised civilian capacity-building does not work, the EU should have recourse to sizeable standby pools of civilian personnel which are pre-identified, trained, and ready for deployment. There is scope for combining military and civilian capability development in at least five areas: communications, information, transport, protection and logistics. The EU could be the first to create a permanent civilian-military Operational Headquarters (OHQ), in Brussels, which could plan for and conduct both civilian and military operations and, allowing for close interaction with all relevant EU actors, could implement a truly comprehensive approach to crisis management. Information gathering, analysis and dissemination are strategic enablers for any military or civilian operation or mission. A real Intelligence Fusion and Analysis Centre should replace the scattered poles of intelligence within the EU institutions. From Strategy to Action. Adopting a strategy for CSDP will not in itself guarantee resolute action in each and every crisis. But forging a consensus on priority regions and issues and drawing the conclusions from that for our capabilities, including planning and conduct, will focus our preventive, long-term efforts, and will certainly make us better prepared for action in any contingency. Being more prepared and knowing in advance what our priority regions and issues are, and why, will then hopefully also strengthen the political will to generate action under the EU flag by the able and willing Member States, and will thus make for an EU that carries its weight on the global stage...|$|E

The deadline for the operational capability of the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> is December 2003.

40|$|The European Union and {{its member}} states have moved with {{considerable}} speed towards {{the creation of}} a European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). Whether what has been achieved so far adds up to a revolution remains a moot point. The Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Maastricht Treaty has not always been noted for its binding character, and too often the debate over security and defence has degenerated into an artificial, zero-sum-type game between Atlanticists and Europeanists. What is required for the success of the ESDP is not simply continued commitment to achieving the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goals</b> set out at Helsinki in 1999, but also the development of what the authors call a ‘strategic culture’, i. e. an institutional confidence and processes to manage and deploy military force as part of the effective range of legitimate policy instruments of the Union.

Bearing in mind that the realities of EU security research planning (at the moment) do not allow for an optimum, "truly" demand-driven planning solution, we present a pragmatic approach to develop a framework for a capability-based planning on EU level and possibly, e. g. as a reference, also for national security research, potentially contributing to a harmonisation of security application requirements at EU and Member State level...|$|R

The first objective of this research is to describe how Italy placed itself in the debate on the development of ESDP if compared to the Franco‐German couple and the British approach: two opposing views dominated this debate: Atlanticism and the “autonomous” approach to European Defence. The former has been supported by the UK and other countries; The latter has been supported by the Franco‐German couple and other countries. Italy has often placed in between, by assuring conformity of the European initiatives with NATO, while promoting a stronger cooperation in a European framework. The thesis analyses in depth the Italian defence policy, the contribution to the European military and civilian capabilities and operations, the participation of Italian high brass in ESDP and NATO structures, the industrial interests in European defence industry and in the intergovernmental cooperation in armaments. The research utilise the Foreign Policy Analysis method, by means of a three level: transatlantic level (relations between US and European allies through NATO); European (relation between Anglo‐ Italians and Franco‐German approaches) internal (the interests of main Italian stakeholders: Politicians, Military, Diplomats and Industry). The main findings are that Italy had given to the ESDP a more sound contribution than expected. This is mainly due to the cooperation with the UK and the bureaucratic interests of the internal administrative actors. Italy is together with France is the first troops contributor for the EU military capabilities.

40|$|Introduction. The {{following}} {{paper is}} based on the author’s "Conditions and options for an autonomous 'Common European Policy on Security and Defence' in and by the European Union in the post-Amsterdam perspective opened at Cologne in June 1999 ", written after the decisions by the European Council in June 1999 and published by the Center for European Integration Studies in Bonn. In addition, it is supplemented by a new analysis of the problems raised by the later agreements {{in the context of the}} EU summit decisions at Helsinki and Nice on European security and defence policy, the European crisis reaction forces and the "Headline Goal" for their strength and composition. The question is asked, whether these decisions and guidelines as well as the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> for the forces meet the conditions posed by the European security situation, the requirements of the European military contribution to Nato as well as those for an independent European military crisis response. This paper discusses the main aspects of the planned security, defence and crisis response policies in the limited European context against the background of crisis and conflict realities on the European periphery and beyond. It deals in particular with six central issues and problems of a general nature: the issue of political-military structures and intergovernmental decisionmaking in the EU, the problem of force structuring between participants for military operations outside Nato, the issue of standardisation, interoperability and readiness of crisis response forces, the problem of "European options" for independent use of EU forces in crisis and conflict, the issue of "European Armed Forces" and European military integration in the EU - the problem of harmony in the Atlantic alliance for an enlarged "European role". These six subjects are interrelated and must be seen in the general context. They are being dealt with in this discussion paper in three parts: I. The necessary political-military structures and political decision-making in the EU on security and defence policy for crisis response, including the requirements for flexibility in exercise of international missions and mandates under changing conditions. II. The requirements for force structuring, including interoperability and standardisation, readiness of forces and sustainability of deployments in crisis contingencies as conditions for "European" options of crisis response. III. The problems of harmony within the alliance, compatibility with US forces und of the creation of "European Armed Forces" for a "European defence" within the alliance as the hidden agenda behind the EC programme of 1999 / 2000...|$|R

The New York Times reported: “The general impression in this command {{is that we}} have not much to boast about in the way of killing Indians. They kept out of the way so effectively that the only band which was struck was struck by accident, and when, by the subsequent attack upon us, it was discovered that another and much larger village was not far off, the command was in too crippled and broken down a condition from starvation and overmarching to turn the information to any account.” But Eastern tabloids so accustomed to reporting <b>military</b> setbacks, <b>headlined</b> the success. “Squaw Scalps,” elated the Chicago Times edition of September 17. Terming Mills’s dawn assault a “A Siouxprise” the paper told how “American Horse, Mortally Wounded, Gives his View of the Sioux Situation.” The Chicago Tribune headlined its coverage of the ravine fight with “He-Fiends, She-Fiends and Imps Driven into a Gulch and Mostly Killed.” The Chicago Times reported that American Horse lingered until 6:00 a.m. and that he confirmed that the tribes were scattering and were becoming discouraged by war. “He appeared satisfied that the lives of his squaws and children were spared.” Strahorn reported: “This Slim Buttes battle is emphatically the event of the campaign so far as punishment for the Indians is concerned, and the participants under General Crook deserve the lasting thanks of our people, for without a doubt the den of redskins so thoroughly rooted out has furnished shelter for more than one of the plundering savages who have annoyed us recently.” Finerty reported: “All other commanders had withdrawn from pursuit, but Crook resolved to teach the savages a lesson. He meant to show that neither distance, bad weather, the loss of horses not the absence of rations could deter the American Army from following up its wild enemies to the bitter end.” ...|$|R
50|$|Lorrain {{was brought}} up in South London as a Congregationalist. He was baptised at a young age. His father was a {{postmaster}} at London Post Office. Fowllowing his father's profession, he worked as a telegraphist in the same post office. His family was a member of London Highgate Road Baptist Church. Here he met F.W. Savidge. In 1890, story of Mary Winchester, a six-year-old British girl who was held hostages by Mizo tribes, and rescued by the British <b>military,</b> was a <b>headline.</b> When Lorrain saw a portrait the hapless girl in captivity in a newspaper, he prayed and planned to work as a missionary to the remote tribes. In December 1890 he saw the exact opportunity under Robert Arthington's Aborigines Mission. He resigned from post office and left London on 16 December 1890. His ship arrived at Calcutta on 21 January 1891, not really knowing how to proceed further for the unexplored land. He stayed in Bengal (now in Bangladesh) for a year. His future associate F.W. Savidge arrived in November 1891, and they met at an evangelical campaign at Brahmanbaria organised by the New Zealand Baptists. On their first attempt to enter Tripura they were bluntly denied by the ruler, Maharaja. Dejected they moved to Chittagong where they stayed for sometime awaiting permission to enter Lushai Hills. Since Lushai Hills was still under tribal chieftainships with constant warfare, their application was deferred and were allowed to stay at Kasalong village, the nearest possible location. Facing heavy shortage of food supply, they stayed there for a few months under constant hunger. Rangamati Commissioner had provided them with a rifle to defend themselves from any tribal insurgency. Unfortunately neither of them had any experience in shooting and could not even hit jungle fowls flogging around their hut. Then they suffered from severe dysentery. The medical doctor advised them to move to Darjeeling where a colder climate would revive them. After they recovered they stayed at Silchar for one whole year in 1893. Fortunately they could encounter some Mizo visitors from time to time, so that they could start learning their language. Finally a permit was issued and they immediately set off on Tlawng River in a canoe on Boxing Day of 1983.|$|R

The 33rd annual Great State of Maine Air Show {{which took place in}} 2008 was expected to be the last, as Brunswick was expected to be closed by the Base Realignment and Closure which was announced in 2005. A record attendance of 150,000 people showed up for the two-day event. The Base was officially decommissioned on May 31st, 2011 with an onsite ceremony.That Same year it was announced that the Great State of Maine Air Show would return to the skies of Brunswick on August 26th and 27th of 2011, It would be organized and put-on by an all-volunteer base without participation from the US Military. The show would take place on the same location as before as the Naval Station had become Brunswick Executive Airport. Despite no organization by the Military, the United States Navy Blue Angels were still to be featured at the show for their first appearance in Maine since 2007. The United States Air Force also supported he event with the A-10 Thunderbolt II Demonstration and a USAF Heritage Flight. Civilian aerobatic and warbird performances rounded {{out the rest of the}} show. Military Static Displays were canceled due to Hurricane Irene which was going on south of the show.

The planned 2013 show was canceled due to Budget Cuts in Congress known as sequestration. The show did not take place in 2014 either because the organizers failed to book a <b>headlining</b> <b>military</b> act. That year however the Blue Angels announced their 2015 schedule which included the Great State of Maine Air Show.The next show is scheduled for September 5th and 6th, 2015 and will feature the Blue Angels, but other performers are yet to be announced.|$|R
