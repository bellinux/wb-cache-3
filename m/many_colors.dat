5|$|The Morgan is a compact, refined breed, {{generally}} bay, {{black or}} chestnut in color, although {{they come in}} <b>many</b> <b>colors,</b> including several variations of pinto. Used in both English and Western disciplines, the breed {{is known for its}} versatility. The Morgan is the state animal of Vermont and the state horse of Massachusetts. Popular children's authors, including Marguerite Henry and Ellen Feld, have portrayed the breed in their books; Henry's Justin Morgan Had a Horse was later made into a Disney movie.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing <b>many</b> <b>colors</b> from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts in the steel of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the building. This allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in <b>many</b> <b>colors</b> for special occasions. The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 the lights were turned off at 2a.m., but New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, wherein the building turns off its lights during bird migration seasons.|$|E
5|$|In 1666, Isaac Newton {{observed}} the Sun's light using a prism, {{and showed that}} it {{is made up of}} light of <b>many</b> <b>colors.</b> In 1800, William Herschel discovered infrared radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum. The 19th century saw advancement in spectroscopic studies of the Sun; Joseph von Fraunhofer recorded more than 600 absorption lines in the spectrum, the strongest of which are still often referred to as Fraunhofer lines. In {{the early years of the}} modern scientific era, the source of the Sun's energy was a significant puzzle. Lord Kelvin suggested that the Sun is a gradually cooling liquid body that is radiating an internal store of heat. Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz then proposed a gravitational contraction mechanism to explain the energy output, but the resulting age estimate was only 20 million years, well short of the time span of at least 300 million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time. In 1890 Joseph Lockyer, who discovered helium in the solar spectrum, proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The Ardennes or Ardennais {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} breeds of draft horse, and {{originates}} from the Ardennes area in Belgium, Luxembourg and France. They are heavy-boned with thick legs and are used for draft work. The Ardennes is found in <b>many</b> <b>colors,</b> although black horses are very rare and are not allowed to be registered with the breed registry. Their history reaches back to Ancient Rome, and throughout the years blood from several other breeds has been added to the Ardennes, although only the Belgian breed had any significant impact. The first Ardennes were imported to the United States in the early 20th century, and the first breed registry was established in Europe in 1929. The horses have been used throughout history as war horses, both as cavalry mounts and to draw artillery, and are used today mainly for heavy draft and farm work, meat production and competitive driving events. They have also been used to influence or create several other horse breeds throughout Europe and Asia.|$|E

5|$|The Newfoundland pony is a {{breed of}} pony {{originating}} in Newfoundland, Canada. They are sturdy and muscular ponies, found in <b>many</b> <b>colors,</b> including the relatively rare white coloration. The Newfoundland developed from {{a mix of}} English, Irish and Scottish pony breeds brought to Newfoundland by settlers {{over a period of}} four centuries. Initially free-roaming, they crossbred to produce the modern type. They were used by settlers as draft and multi-purpose ponies until the mid-20th century, when they were brought {{almost to the point of}} extinction by mechanization and slaughter. The population rebounded slightly after the formation of a breed registry in 1980, but still remains low. In 1997, the Newfoundland pony was declared a heritage breed of Newfoundland and Labrador, which afforded it protection under the law, but the breed has not yet been recognized under the Canadian federal Animal Pedigree Act. As of 2008, there were 248 registered ponies of breeding age, out of a total population of 361. In 2013, the widely dispersed breeding population is still estimated at between 200 and 250 animals.|$|E

The turtles can see <b>many</b> <b>colors,</b> but are most {{sensitive}} to light from violet to yellow or wavelengths of 400 to 600 nanometers. They do not see <b>many</b> <b>colors</b> in the orange to red portion of the light spectrum. On land, however, the sea turtles are nearsighted because the lenses in the eyes are spherical and adjusted to refraction underwater. Sea turtles have no external ear and only one ear bone, called the columella. With one ear bone, the turtles can only hear low frequency sounds, from 200 to 700Hz. Sounds can also be detected through vibrations of the head, backbone, and shell. The nose of the turtle has two external openings and connects {{to the roof of}} the mouth through internal openings. The lower surface of the nasal passage has two sets of sensory cells called the Jacobson’s organ. The turtle can use this organ to smell by pumping water in and out of its nose.|$|E
