5|$|Although NY18 {{is signed}} as east–west, it runs {{primarily}} north–south through the western portion of Niagara County.

In central Orleans County, NY18 meets the Lake Ontario State Parkway at the Lakeside Beach State Park. The parkway then becomes the lakeside road, and NY18 veers south to follow a more inland routing.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the poet}} was <b>moving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Surrealism, his {{adherence}} to strict Marxism-Leninism was reportedly questioned {{by both the}} PCF and the Soviet Union. Semiotician Philip Beitchman places their attitude in connection with Tzara's own vision of Utopia, which combined communist messages with Freudo-Marxist psychoanalysis and made use of particularly violent imagery. Reportedly, Tzara refused to be enlisted in supporting the party line, maintaining his independence and refusing to take the forefront at public rallies.|$|E

5|$|In 1912, Vesto Slipher made spectrographic {{studies of}} the {{brightest}} spiral nebulae to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the spiral nebulae have high Doppler shifts, indicating that they are moving at a rate exceeding the velocity of the stars he had measured. He found {{that the majority of}} these nebulae are <b>moving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> us.|$|E
5|$|Saxophonists Parker and Lester Young were {{important}} influences on Tristano's development. Another major figure was pianist Art Tatum: Tristano practiced solo Tatum pieces {{early in his}} career, before gradually <b>moving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> this influence {{in search of his}} own style. Bebopper Bud Powell also affected Tristano's playing and teaching, as he admired the younger pianist's articulation and expression.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression (1929–c. 1939) hit {{especially}} hard in Western Canada, including Manitoba. The {{collapse of the}} world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, <b>moving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a reliance on wheat production. The Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner to the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), was founded in 1932.|$|E
5|$|As it tracked northward, {{the storm}} failed to {{organize}} at first, {{due to the}} influence of an upper-level low to its south. The circulation became broad and elongated, as well as removed from the deepest convection. However, after <b>moving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the low, the convection became better organized and more associated with the convection. After some initial slow organization continued, an area of deep convection developed over the center midday on September 20. An eye developed within the convection, and late on September 20 Jeanne re-attained hurricane status about 350mi (570km) east-northeast of the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, his {{reputation}} and fame were waning, and his passing was little noticed within the artistic community. His artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely. While the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were commonplace in contemporary art, his work was too original and personal to be well understood. By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic movement had been <b>moving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the early idealism that the artist had helped found.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} early modern {{individuals}} experienced {{a period of}} youth in the modern sense. For many the early teens were marked by <b>moving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> home to undertake life-cycle service, which was necessary {{so that they could}} build up skills and capital that would enable them to marry and create a separate household. Lower down in society boys might be apprenticed to a trade, or become agricultural servants. Girls might go into domestic or agricultural service. For those higher up in society and increasingly for those lower down, this might be after a period of schooling or even university.|$|E
5|$|In {{models of}} the {{expanding}} universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. This receding is not due to motion through space, but rather {{to the expansion of}} space itself. For example, galaxies far away from Earth appear to be <b>moving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Earth with a speed proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the Hubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|International trade, {{facilitated}} by the shipping route in adjacent Strait of Malacca, and manufacturing are the key sectors. Malaysia is an exporter of natural and agricultural resources, and petroleum is a major export. Malaysia has once been the largest producer of tin, rubber and palm oil in the world. Manufacturing has a large influence in the country's economy, although Malaysia's economic structure has been <b>moving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it. Malaysia {{remains one of the}} world's largest producers of palm oil.|$|E

5|$|Little says Rosenberg was {{influenced}} by Erich Fromm, George Albee, and George Miller to adopt a community focus in his work, <b>moving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> clinical psychological practice. The central ideas influencing this shift by Rosenberg were that: (1) individual mental health depends on the social structure of a community (Fromm), (2) therapists alone are unable to meet the psychological needs of a community (Albee), and (3) knowledge about human behavior will increase if psychology is freely given to the community (Miller).|$|E
5|$|The Hipparcos {{satellite}} also {{measured the}} proper motion of Beta Pictoris: it is traveling eastwards {{at a rate}} of 4.65 milliarcseconds per year, and northwards {{at a rate of}} 83.10 milliarcseconds per year. Measurements of the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum reveals it is <b>moving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Earth at a rate of 20km/s. Several other stars share the same motion through space as Beta Pictoris and likely formed from the same gas cloud at roughly the same time: these comprise the Beta Pictoris moving group.|$|E
5|$|The debris disk around Beta Pictoris is seen edge-on by {{observers}} on Earth, and is orientated in a northeast-southwest direction.

The disk is rotating: the part to the northeast of the star is <b>moving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Earth, while the part to the southwest of the disc is moving towards Earth.|$|E
