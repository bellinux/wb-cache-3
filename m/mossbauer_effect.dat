The influence of ion-beam parameters (ion mass, fluence) and of sample parameters (external magnetic field and stress during implantation) were investigated. The Fe films, {{some of them}} containing a thin 57 Fe marker layer for Mössbauer spectroscopy, were deposited on Si(100) substrates, by electron-beam and effusion-cell evaporation. The films were irradiated with 20 Ne, 56 Fe, 86 Kr and 132 Xe ions at energies chosen so that the implantation profiles peaked near {{the middle of the}} Fe films. The as-deposited films were magnetically isotropic and had a high coercivity. After ion implantation, the coercivity decreased and magnetic anisotropy developed. Both changes correlated with a decrease in the internal film stress. External mechanical stress applied during the irradiation had hardly any influence on the magnetic texture, opposite to an external magnetic field applied during or before ion implantation. The results are compared with those obtained for ion-irradiated polycrystalline Ni films and epitaxial Fe films and discussed with respect to the role of radiation-induced extended defects as pinning centers.

The thin film structures were deposited on MgO (001) substrates using a four source ultra-high-vacuum based sputtering equipment. Reflection {{high energy electron diffraction}} {{showed that the}} body-centered cubic phase of Co could be stabilized up to a thickness of about eight atomic monolayers. X-ray diffraction measurements confirmed that the Fe/Co superlattices were single-crystalline with a pure body-centered cubic structure. The crystalline quality and the interface profile were found to be strongly dependent on the growth temperature. Furthermore, the Fe/Co superlattices were also found to exhibit novel magnetic properties. The first order magnetic anisotropy constant for the body-centered cubic Co phase was determined to be negative with a magnitude of 110 kJ/m 3. Magnetization and Mössbauer measurements showed that the Fe and Co magnetic moments in the superlattices were enhanced. Spin polarized neutron reflectometry proved that all the magnetic moments were collinear. The interlayer exchange coupling and the giant magnetoresistance effect in Fe/V superlattices were also studied. The strength of the coupling was found to be dependent on the thickness of the Fe and the V layers.

In the case of gamma rays, such a resonance is seen in the technique of Mössbauer spectroscopy. In the <b>Mössbauer</b> <b>effect</b> the narrow resonance absorption for nuclear gamma absorption can be successfully attained by physically immobilizing atomic nuclei in a crystal. The immobilization of nuclei at both ends of a gamma resonance interaction is required so that no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition. Such loss of energy causes gamma ray resonance absorption to fail.
