For the broadcast channel of broadband <b>mobile</b> <b>radiocommunication</b> systems the 60 GHz band is internationally recommended. The networks are to be constructed from small radio cells (picocells) using cost-effective technology. The combination of optical communication technology with microwave technology offers a highly promising beginning to this development, allowing not only low-loss glass-fibre transmission of signals but also simple optical generation of microwave signals at low-cost base stations. This contribution describes methods of optical microwave generation and experiments thereon...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY High {{capacity}} cellular <b>mobile</b> <b>radiocommunication</b> {{services in}} Europe and in North America have set extremely demanding minimization interference {{targets for the}} involved operating systems, {{in order to keep}} spectrum efficiency in high levels. The evaluation of the conditional cochannei interference probability remains a very interesting scientific area and a major concern in mobile communications. Therefore the evaluation is strongly needed to maintain thr rerquired transmission quality level, to control the spectrum efficiency, to optimize the design criteria and to predict the signai-to-interference ratio in different cellular systems. In this paper, a new mathematical method is presented suitable for the exact exact evaluation o f the outage probability of this type of intereference under specific considerations concerning the existing mobile's propagation environment. Using this prototype method, a high level of probability's accuracy is obtained especially in the worst cases, where the received signai is degraded due to the presence of radio-shadowing phenomena. ...|$|E
