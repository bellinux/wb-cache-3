30|$|In general, law {{enforcement}} officers preferred {{to err on the}} side of caution. It is better to take a person in for more questioning than to <b>miss</b> <b>picking</b> up a person who has outstanding warrants. When officers provide data on the stopped individual to a police database “near misses” are returned if there is no direct match. Sorting out a number of near misses may consume too much time, so the officer may take the individual back to the police station for full identification.|$|R

6000|$|She moved aside so as {{to leave}} the ascent--by an {{inverted}} flower-pot and a laurel branch--open to her friend, thus knocking {{down one of the}} pile of books which she had taken {{to the top of the}} wall. <b>Miss</b> Nugent <b>picked</b> it up, 'Marie Stuart!

25|$|It was {{not only}} that catches were <b>missed.</b> The <b>picking</b> up was slovenly and the returns to the wicket badly directed. There was no {{anticipation}} or cutting off of runs by {{the men in the}} deep, and quite often Brown had to halt a bowler in his run-up to direct a fieldsmen to his proper position.|$|R
60|$|The {{explanation}} of the following poem seems to give added color to it. Mr. Alcott {{had a habit of}} cutting his own hair--a feat that can certainly be called unusual!--and it was after one of these occasions that <b>Miss</b> Alcott <b>picked</b> up the curl and pasted it {{on the corner of the}} paper upon which the poem is written.|$|R
5000|$|Where's My Water? has {{received}} acclaim from critics. Mike Thompson of Gamezebo said [...] "anyone who enjoys physics puzzle titles {{would be out}} of their mind to <b>miss</b> <b>picking</b> this up". IGN's Justin Davis said players [...] "will have a ton of fun figuring out how to get Swampy clean level after level". Chris Reed, writing for Slide To Play, called the game [...] "a highly polished and appealing physics puzzler that nearly everyone can enjoy". Along with the gameplay, reviewers have made special mention of the game's graphical presentation. Gamezebo said the graphics [...] "are particularly great, featuring crisp and cartoon-like visuals that look like something out of ... well, out of a Disney cartoon", and IGN said that Swampy [...] "animates wonderfully and always appears incredibly adorable". Pocket Gamer's Steve McCaskill praised its visual design, stating that it gave [...] "the impression of an interactive cartoon".|$|R
40|$|Two {{pieces of}} wool fabric sewn {{together}} in several places. One is more faded than the other. In some areas, {{the edge of}} the fragment has been turned under. The two pieces may be originally from the same fabric. Both have remnants of red countered weft twining with loops passing over 2 or three warps. Because the twining yarns are so fragmented, the structure is obscured.; Several holes and tears. Uneven fading. Much of the red weft twining is <b>missing.</b> Occasional weft <b>picks</b> <b>missing</b> or very loose, also. The wool still retains some luster...|$|R

50|$|The {{low point}} of Seafire {{operations}} came during Operation Avalanche the invasion of Salerno in September 1943. Of the 106 Seafires available to the British escort carriers on 9 September only 39 were serviceable by the dawn of D-Day plus Two (11 September). Part of this was attributed to the flat, calm conditions present, which meant that {{there had not been}} enough headwind in order to adequately slow down the Seafires on landing. Many aircraft <b>missed</b> <b>picking</b> up the arrestor wires and flew into the crash barriers while others had their arrestor hooks pulled off the fuselage because they caught the wires at too high a speed. In spite of these problems, the Seafires (especially the L Mk IIs and L Mk IIIs, with their low altitude rated Merlin engines) were used to patrol the vicinity of the carrier fleet as protection against low altitude attackers, while the longer ranging fighters, such as the Grumman F6F Hellcat, took on a similar role further out and at higher altitudes.|$|R

5000|$|... 24. The Great TV Turn-off Katie is sick of {{television}} and how it {{has become such a}} guilty pleasure for all of her friends. After Tony <b>misses</b> <b>picking</b> her up in time for a movie she was really excited about seeing, due to a baseball game, she vents to her mother about how TV seems like such {{a waste of time and}} intelligence, time that could be better spent doing other things. Her mother takes this to heart and winds up writing an article lambasting TV and its deleterious effects on society. Everyone on Wakeman sees the article and gets angry with Katie. Due to another school having a television turn-off, (where you turn the TV off for two weeks and find other things to do) the principal comes up with the idea to have something similar occur at Wakeman. They have contracts they need to sign, and the students actually find other worthwhile activities to spend their time on, but the Fantastic Foursome plots to get other students to break their contracts and attend a TV party Laura is throwing. Thanks to Katie's idea to spend the whole day at an amusement park having fun, no one goes to Laura's party and the turn-off is a success.|$|R

If she would, let her write and tell him so.

It was a severe, threatening, bitterly cold day, not at all fit for sliding, even had not both the young ladies and <b>Miss</b> Fennimore <b>picked</b> up a suspicion of cold; but Phoebe {{had no doubt that}} there would be a farewell visit, and did not like to lose it.|$|R

50|$|When Tyler arrives, he sees Holly {{sitting in}} front of the fireplace, the first place he saw her the morning he woke up in her house previously. Holly tries recreating the weekend as Tyler runs around the house looking for Ali. He discovers Ali {{unconscious}} tied mid-air to the ceiling, forehead bleeding. He lowers her down, wakes her up, grabs a fire poker and starts trying to escape the house as Holly goes to get her gun. Tyler and Ali make it outside and before they get away, Holly stops them at gunpoint. Tyler tells Holly that he loves Ali and not her and he never will.

50|$|The Ole Miss Rebels {{began the}} 2009 season ranked high and with high expectations. After beating Memphis, 45-14, and Southeastern Louisiana, 52-6, which gave Ole Miss the second longest winning streak {{in the nation}} at eight games {{dating back to the}} 2008 season, Ole Miss climbed as high as No. 4 in the AP Poll before losing their 2009 SEC opener, 16-10, on the road at South Carolina in a Thursday night game on September 24. After the loss, Ole Miss fell 17 spots in the AP Poll, down to No. 21. Ole Miss went on the road again and beat Vanderbilt the next week, 23-7.

50|$|It is {{asserted}} {{that there are}} a combination of British and German records which state that she was engaged by Schiff 40. The records show that Tarpon had attacked the Q-ship Schiff 40/Schürbek, but her first torpedoes had <b>missed.</b> The Q-ship <b>picked</b> up the Tarpon on her sonar and her periscope was sighted. The ship dropped numerous depth charges in a sustained counterattack that went on most of the morning. Finally a pattern of depth charges brought wreckage to the surface. The Q-ship remained on the scene until 0500 the next morning when it became clear the submarine had been sunk. Tarpon was reported overdue on 22 April 1940.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Eliphalet Hopper, in his Sunday-best {{broadcloth}} was {{a marvel}} of propriety.

Stephen's intention was not to speak. But he remembered what the Judge had said to his mother, and nodded. Why, indeed, should he put on airs with this man {{who had come to}} St. Louis unknown and unrecommended and poor, who by sheer industry had made himself of importance in the large business of Carvel &, Company? As for Stephen Brice, he was not yet earning his salt, but existing by the charity of Judge Silas Whipple.|$|R
