25|$|The World Health Organizations {{recommended}} albendazole or <b>mebendazole</b> for treatment.|$|E
25|$|Metronidazole alone rarely causes Stevens–Johnson syndrome, but is {{reported}} to occur at high rates when combined with <b>mebendazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|For this purpose, broad-spectrum benzimidazoles such as <b>mebendazole</b> and {{albendazole}} are {{the drugs}} of choice recommended by WHO. These anthelminthics are administered {{in a single}} dose are safe, relatively inexpensive, and effective for several months. <b>Mebendazole</b> can be given with a single dose twice a day for three consecutive days. Albendazole is given at a single dose. WHO recommends annual treatment in areas where between 20 and 50% of people are infected, and a twice a year treatment if it is over 50%; and in low risk situation (i.e. less than 20% prevalence) case-by-case treatment. In addition to these, pyrantel pamoate is also equally effective on ascaris. However, {{it has been reported}} that albendazole, <b>mebendazole,</b> and pyrantel pamoate are not entirely effective against T. trichiura with single oral doses in population-based control.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{treatment}} for hookworm are benzimidazoles, specifically albendazole and <b>mebendazole.</b> BZAs kill adult worms by binding to the nematode’s β-tubulin and subsequently inhibiting microtubule polymerization within the parasite. In certain circumstances, levamisole and pyrantel pamoate may be used. A 2008 review {{found that the}} efficacy of single-dose treatments for hookworm infections were as follows: 72% for albendazole, 15% for <b>mebendazole,</b> and 31% for pyrantel pamoate. This substantiates prior claims that albendazole is much more effective than <b>mebendazole</b> for hookworm infections. Also of note is that the World Health Organization does recommend anthelmintic treatment in pregnant women after the first trimester. It is also recommended that if the patient also suffers from anemia that ferrous sulfate (200mg) be administered three times daily {{at the same time}} as anthelmintic treatment; this should be continued until hemoglobin values return to normal which could take up to 3 months.|$|E
25|$|Mammomonogamiasis is {{relatively}} easy to treat. Manual or bronchoscopic removal of worms has been successful. One case followed up with aspiration. Although no controlled study on the efficacy of antihelmintics in treating mammomonogamiasis has been conducted, most patients were given albendazole, <b>mebendazole</b> or thiabendazole with no adverse effects. Patients given albendazole were instructed to take 400mg for three days or if given a combination of drugs, albendazole is given 200mg, three times a day for three days, with <b>mebendazole</b> at 100mg, three times a day for three days. The drug regimens ranged from 200–3000mg/day for three to 20 days.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{not walking}} barefoot where {{the disease is}} common. At a {{population}} level, decreasing outdoor defecation, not using feces as fertilizer, and mass deworming is effective. Treatment is typically with the medications albendazole or <b>mebendazole</b> for one to three days. Iron supplements may be needed in those with anemia.|$|E
25|$|This lack of {{deworming}} {{of pregnant}} women is {{explained by the fact}} that most individuals still fear that anthelmintic treatment will result in adverse birth outcomes. But a 2006 study by Gyorkos et al. found that when comparing a group {{of pregnant women}} treated with <b>mebendazole</b> with a control placebo group, both illustrated rather similar rates in adverse birth outcomes. The treated group demonstrated 5.6% adverse birth outcomes, while the control group had 6.25% adverse birth outcomes. Furthermore, Larocque et al. illustrated that treatment for hookworm infection actually led to positive health results in the infant. This study concluded that treatment with <b>mebendazole</b> plus iron supplements during antenatal care significantly reduced the proportion of very low birth weight infants when compared to a placebo control group. Studies so far have validated recommendations to treat infected pregnant women for hookworm infection during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|In {{areas where}} more than 20% of the {{population}} is affected treating everyone is recommended. This has a cost of about 2 to 3 cents per person per treatment. This is known as mass drug administration and is often carried out among school-age children. For this purpose, broad-spectrum benzimidazoles such as <b>mebendazole</b> and albendazole are the drugs of choice recommended by WHO.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{improved}} sanitation, {{which includes}} improving access to toilets and proper disposal of feces. Handwashing with soap appears protective. In areas {{where more than}} 20% {{of the population is}} affected, treating everyone at regular intervals is recommended. Reoccurring infections are common. There is no vaccine. Treatments recommended by the World Health Organization are the medications albendazole, <b>mebendazole,</b> levamisole, or pyrantel pamoate. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and nitazoxanide.|$|E
25|$|Medications {{that are}} used to kill roundworms are called ascaricides. Those {{recommended}} by the World Health Organization for ascariasis are: albendazole, <b>mebendazole,</b> levamisole and pyrantel pamoate. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and nitazoxanide. Pyrantel pamoate may induce intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load. Albendazole is contraindicated during pregnancy and children under two years of age. Thiabendazole may cause migration of the worm into the esophagus, so it is usually combined with piperazine.|$|E
25|$|Broad-spectrum benzimidazoles (such as {{albendazole}} and <b>mebendazole)</b> are {{the first}} line treatment of intestinal roundworm and tapeworm infections. Macrocyclic lactones (such as ivermectin) are effective against adult and migrating larval stages of nematodes. Praziquantel is the drug of choice for schistosomiasis, taeniasis, and most types of food-borne trematodiases. Oxamniquine is also widely used in mass deworming programmes. Pyrantel is commonly used for veterinary nematodiasis. Artemisinins and derivatives are proving to be candidates as drugs of choice for trematodiasis.|$|E
2500|$|Drugs used in {{treatment}} of A. caninum infections of dogs include: dichlorvos, fenbendazole, flubendazole, <b>mebendazole,</b> nitroscanate, piperazine, pyrantel, milbemycin, moxidectin, diethylcarbamazine, oxibendazole, [...] and ivermectin.|$|E
2500|$|... {{have been}} {{associated}} with agranulocytosis, including antiepileptics (such as carbamazepine and valproate), antithyroid drugs (carbimazole, methimazole, and propylthiouracil), antibiotics (penicillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole), ACE inhibitors (benazepril), cytotoxic drugs, gold, NSAIDs (indomethacin, naproxen, phenylbutazone, metamizole), <b>mebendazole,</b> allopurinol the antidepressants mianserin and mirtazapine, and some antipsychotics (the atypical antipsychotic clozapine in particular). Clozapine users in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the UK must be nationally registered for monitoring of low WBC and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC).|$|E
5000|$|In the UK, <b>mebendazole</b> and {{piperazine}} {{are currently}} (2007) preferred. [...] <b>Mebendazole</b> {{has a much}} higher failure rate in clinical practice than albendazole, thiabendazole, or ivermectin.|$|E
50|$|Carbamazepine and {{phenytoin}} lower serum {{levels of}} <b>mebendazole.</b> Cimetidine does not appreciably raise serum <b>mebendazole</b> (in {{contrast to the}} similar drug albendazole), consistent with its poor systemic absorption.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is {{by either}} {{thiabendazole}} or <b>mebendazole.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Mebendazole</b> {{is usually}} well tolerated. Common side effects include headache, vomiting, and ringing in the ears. If used at large doses it may cause bone marrow suppression. It is unclear {{if it is}} safe in pregnancy. <b>Mebendazole</b> is a broad-spectrum antihelminthic agent of the {{benzimidazole}} type.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mebendazole</b> - {{effective}} against pinworms, roundworms and hookworms ...|$|E
50|$|The World Health Organizations {{recommended}} albendazole or <b>mebendazole</b> for treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mebendazole</b> is {{a highly}} effective, broad-spectrum antihelmintic {{indicated}} {{for the treatment of}} nematode infestations, including roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, threadworm, pinworm, and the intestinal form of trichinosis prior to its spread into the tissues beyond the digestive tract. Other drugs are used to treat worm infections outside the digestive tract, as <b>mebendazole</b> is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream. <b>Mebendazole</b> is used alone in those with mild to moderate infestations. It kills parasites relatively slowly, and in those with very heavy infestations, it can cause some parasites to migrate out of the digestive system, leading to appendicitis, bile duct problems, or intestinal perforation. To avoid this, heavily infested patients may be treated with piperazine, either before or instead of <b>mebendazole.</b> Piperazine paralyses the parasites, causing them to pass in the feces. It is also used rarely in the treatment of hydatid disease. Evidence for effectiveness for this disease, however, is poor.|$|E
5000|$|An {{infection}} of N. americanus parasites {{can be treated}} by using benzimidazoles, albendazole, and <b>mebendazole.</b> A blood transfusion may be necessary in severe cases of anemia. Light infections are usually left untreated in areas where reinfection is common. Iron supplements and a diet high in protein will speed the recovery process. [...] In a case study involving 56-60 men with Trichuris trichiura and/or N. americanus infections, both albendazole and <b>mebendazole</b> were 90% effective in curing T. trichiura. However, albendazole had a 95% cure rate for N. americanus, while <b>mebendazole</b> only had a 21% cure rate. This suggests albendazole is most effective for treating both T. trichiura and N. americanus.|$|E
50|$|It {{is related}} to <b>mebendazole</b> by {{replacement}} of the left most benzene ring by thiophene.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mebendazole</b> is {{distributed}} in international markets by Johnson and Johnson {{and a number}} of generic manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|Anthelmintics such as <b>mebendazole</b> and {{albendazole}} {{have been}} reported to eliminate infestation of humans more effectively than thiabendazole.|$|E
50|$|Metronidazole alone rarely causes Stevens-Johnson syndrome, but is {{reported}} to occur at high rates when combined with <b>mebendazole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Stevens-Johnson {{syndrome}} {{and the more}} severe toxic epidermal necrolysis can occur when <b>mebendazole</b> is combined with high doses of metronidazole.|$|E

50|$|There is no {{consensus}} on optimal therapeutic approach. The most commonly used drug is diethylcarbamazine (DEC), but it is, however, often ineffective. Although other drugs have been tried such as praziquantel, ivermectin, and albendozole, none {{has proven to be}} reliably and rapidly effective. <b>Mebendazole</b> appeared more active than DEC in eliminating the infection, and had comparable overall responses. Thiabendazole evidenced a small, but significant activity against the infection. A combination of treatments, DEC plus <b>mebendazole,</b> was much more effective than single drug doses.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mebendazole</b> {{came into}} use in 1971, {{after it was}} {{developed}} in Belgium. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Mebendazole</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 0.004 and 0.04 USD per dose. In the United States a single dose is about 884.00 USD as of 2016, while in Australia and the UK it costs about 5 USD.|$|E
