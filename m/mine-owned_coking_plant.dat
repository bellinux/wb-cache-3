40|$|International audienceIn {{contaminated}} soils, several {{natural processes}} (e. g. biodegradation, oxidation) can induce degradation of organic pollutants. To evaluate {{the effects of}} biodegradation on the organic matter and the main organic constituents (coal and coal tar) of a <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> soil, we conducted a batch incubation experiment, whereby mineral nutrient solution and a microbial inoculum from the <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> soil {{were added to the}} different samples. Microbial counts were monitored during the 9 months of the biodegradation experiment and the mineralization rate was quantified by measuring the CO 2 produced and the content, molecular weight (MW) distribution and molecular composition of the solvent extractable organic matter. The microbial enumeration and mineralization rate demonstrated no biodegradation with the coal tar but biodegradation was observed for the coal and <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> soil samples. The <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> soil exhibited the highest biodegradation rate, probably due to complex interactions between the different organic and mineral phases and the presence of various nutrient and carbon sources. Biodegradation of the kerogen with subsequent production of lower MW compounds (n-alkanes and isoprenoids) was observed for both coal and <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> soil samples. The results indicate that the kerogen could be a potential source of carbon for the microorganisms and showed the central role of coal in the changes observed for the <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> soil...|$|R

25|$|Water {{quality was}} also {{affected}} by four <b>coking</b> <b>plants,</b> at Orgreave, Brookhouse, Avenue and Coalite. Discharges from them significantly increased the ammonia {{content and the}} biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the river. Orgreave was discharging effluent with 146mg/l of ammonia in 1985, which needed to be around 70 per cent lower to improve the river quality to Grade D, but the plant closed in 1991, and water quality has improved dramatically since. Discharges from Avenue <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> were diverted into a foul sewer in 1986, {{to enable them to}} be treated at Old Whittington treatment works. The plant closed in 1992, but there were problems with phenolic oils leaching from the original storage lagoons into the river for some years after closure. Discharges from the Coalite plant reached the river through its tributary, the River Doe Lea. Again, there were significant improvements to the treatment of effluent in 1984, 1989 and 1996. Brookhouse was the smallest of the four works, but closed in the early 1980s before remedial works were implemented. The <b>coking</b> <b>plants</b> were the worst polluters of the river, and their closure resulted in water quality being significantly improved.|$|R

Wastewater treatment <b>plant</b> of <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> in Bao Gang applied A/O process in biological treatment, used special treatment agent-M 180 by coagulation and sedimentation process. Through treatment, the parameters reached the first grade of GB 13456 - 92. It is of great reference significance for process debug and operation of the coking wastewater treatment system. Foreword Coking Wastewater are discharged from coking, gasification and refining process of chemical products. From the generated source separation, there are water in the coal(surface water and combined water), water from process of recovery and refining of chemical products. Coking wastewater contains but ammonia, cyanide, thiocyanate, fluoride and other inorganic pollutants, also phenol, oil, naphthalene, pyridine, quinoline, anthracene and other poly-cyclic aromatics, {{all of which are}} difficult to treat biologically. <b>Coking</b> wastewater treatment <b>plant</b> of <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> in Bao Gang is responsible for the treatment of wastewater from production of the new system of <b>coking</b> <b>plant.</b> Due to the increase of coke production in recent years, waste production has been rising, followed by constantly tightening emissions standards.

25|$|From the 1880s {{the water}} quality {{deteriorated}} rapidly, {{as a result of}} coal mining and its associated communities. The river became unable to sustain life, and by 1974, was the most polluted of the rivers within the River Don catchment. The pollutants came from <b>coking</b> <b>plants,</b> from inefficient sewage treatment plants, and from the manufacture of chemicals. Major investment in upgrading the sewage treatment works took place, and in the treatment of industrial effluent before it was discharged to the river. The closure of the main <b>coking</b> <b>plants</b> has also aided the recovery of the river, and enabled restocking with fish to begin in 1994. By 1996 there was evidence for self-sustaining fish populations, and that the river could support organised angling.|$|R
