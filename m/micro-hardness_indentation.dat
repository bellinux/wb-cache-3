40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} {{composition}} on indentation deformation and cracking behavior of Na 2 O-TiO 2 -SiO 2 glasses were {{studied in the}} light of structural considerations and parameters such as the atomic packing density (Cg) and the network energy, using a combination of elastic measurements and <b>micro-hardness</b> <b>indentation</b> experiments. Na 2 O-TiO 2 -SiO 2 glasses with titania contents of 4 – 10 mol% and sodium oxide contents of 10 – 25 mol% were prepared through a traditional melt-quench process. Indentation experiments were conducted using a Vickers indenter with loads ranging from 10 mN to 49 N. Critical loads for crack initiation and cracking patterns were systematically investigated and correlated with the elastic properties of glass. In this ternary system concerning a relatively large range of Poisson's ratio (ν), a minimum in critical crack initiation load was observed at a ν of 0. 21 – 0. 22.

40|$|The {{effect of}} using argon and helium {{shielding}} gas on weld quality, defect formation and microstructure of laser welded aluminium alloy 2024 -T 3 was investigated. Full penetration autogenous welds {{were made at}} a constant laser power of 4. 9 kW using a continuous-wave (CW) fibre laser at travel speeds of 3. 0 – 5. 0 m/min and focal positions of + 4 to − 4 mm. To investigate this effect, a comparison was made between Ar and He by examining the weld quality {{in terms of the}} face and root weld width, the weld width ratio; and the presence of welding defects including undercut, underfill, reinforcement, porosity and crack. Optical metallography, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and <b>micro-hardness</b> <b>indentation</b> testing on weld cross-sections were used to identify how the chemical and physical properties of the shielding gases and the characteristics of the fibre laser affect the overall weld geometry. Based on the results, it was believed that relatively small influence of ionisation on fibre laser induced plume enhanced the welding process stability and lowered the threshold power density for keyhole formation. Both Ar and He shielding gases could therefore, be used effectively to produce good quality welds. However, at the lowest speed and also at the maximum focal position, higher ionisation potential and thermal conductivity of helium resulted in an excessive weld width when He was used even though, the overall weld quality was better than that with Ar...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the effect of indentation on the fatigue behaviour of an aluminium alloy (A 1 - 2. 5 wt% Cu - 1. 2 wt% Mg) has been carried out. Room-temperature aged (RTA) and high-temperature aged (HTA) specimens were cycled in tension-compression under conditions of constant plastic strain in the range epsilonp = 1. 0 x 10 - 4 to 1. 4 x 10 - 3 in a 20 kN Mand servohydrolic machine. The fatigue behaviour was cyclic hardening in the RTA state and cyclic softening in the HTA state. During fatigue, the RTA specimen surfaces were quickly covered with coarse slip lines, which after prolonged cycling developed into PSBs. Unlike the slip lines, the PSBs did not always traverse the entire grain, but started off in patches which steadily grew larger and more intense. Dislocation structures were studied using TEM and were found to develop from a structure consisting of quenched-in loops and helices into slip bands concentrated on groups of { 111 } planes, often dominated by dislocations of a single Burgers' vector. Further cycling resulted in more concentrated slip in localized bands leading to a misorientation of these bands relative to the matrix. The development of surface relief in HTA specimens was much slower than {{in the case of}} the RTA specimens and took place over thousands of cycles. The slip lines were shorter and broader, and in late stages more wavy in appearance, both features typical of cross-slip. The dislocation structure consisted of some loop formation but mostly dislocations tangled with the S precipitates and were densely packed at the precipitate-matrix boundary. There was no evidence for the break-up of S precipitates during cyclic deformation. Surface damage was introduced in the form of Vickers <b>micro-hardness</b> <b>indentations.</b> The indentations were made in the middle of the grains in order to obtain a single-crystal response. Optical microscope studies of the surface were carried out using Nomarski contrast and scanning laser microscopy, and the dislocation configurations were studied by TEM. Analytical models were used to see whether a correlation could be found between the observations of slip and calculations of resolved shear stresses. A reasonable correlation was found, which prompted the extension of the modelling to fatigue slip near indentations. The development of fatigue damage was studied both before and after various stages of fatigue, and it was found that the presence of indentations had a significant effect on the fatigue behaviour of the indented grain. During the initial fatigue cycles, slip lines were observed near indentations in the RTA specimens, and modelling indicated that the effect could be due to the residual stresses surrounding the indentation. In all cases the slip appeared in trace directions of planes containing slip systems with high Schmidt factors, but in many cases on planes not containing the active slip system in fatigue. In the HTA specimens a similar effect was noted at the stage when surface slip started to appear, but only associated with slip on the slip plane containing the active slip system. Cracking was initiated near most indentations, but none were found to lead to the ultimate failure of the specimens. This could be mainly due to stress concentrations at the specimen shoulders. Cracks initiated along the ridge of the indentations oriented approximately perpendicular to the stress axis and appeared at the corresponding corners of the indentations approximately half-way into the fatigue life. In the case of the RTA specimens, the cracks propagated along traces of { 111 } slip planes, whereas in the HTA specimens the cracks were more irregular and sometimes followed the traces of { 100 } planes. Modelling suggested that the preferred path for crack propagation was associated with a concentration of shear stress on highly stressed slip planes. The cracks were never observed to stop propagating, and some cracks propagated into neighbouring grains, and it is thought that the condition for damage to lead to failure is the size of the indentation in combination with the magnitude of the applied stress/strain...|$|R

40|$|In Part A of the thesis, {{the concept}} of {{hardness}} and its measurements are briefly reviewed at the beginning. Micro-hardness {{and its relation to}} crystal properties is also discussed. <b>Micro-hardness</b> test <b>indentations</b> with the double cone made on the (0001) plane of cleaved single crystals of zinc are measured and the variation of hardness with direction is studied. The value of hardness repeats itself for every 60 degrees due to the six fold symmetry of the basal plane. The observations are not in conformity with theory. The distortion around the impressions is studied by multiple-beam interferometry using the microflat technique. Kink traces on a microscopic scale are very clearly shown by phase contrast microscopy. The extent of the region of kink traces belonging to different kink systems, with the different positions of the indenter is revealed and discussed. Micro-twins are observed at the tips of the impression for certain positions only. An X-ray study of the disordered region around the impression was also made and is discussed. Clear evidence for the process of polygonization is seen after annealing at 380 °C for 2 hours. In Part B, the equilibrium diagrams of binary alloys is briefly reviewed.

40|$|Hard {{coatings}} like {{titanium nitride}} (TiN) normally contain {{a high degree}} of internal stress (usually compressive in-plane parallel with the surface) owing to growth defects developed during the deposition process and thermal mismatch effects after final cooling; it is, therefore, difficult to produce single-layer TiN coatings thicker than 6 - 7 mu m, without adhesion problems. In the present study, thick coatings (i. e. > 10 mu m) have been achieved by alternate multilayering of TiN with Ti interlayers, leading to a tougher and less-stressed film. However, having a constant distribution of titanium interlayer thickness is not necessarily the best solution to achieve maximum performance in terms of wear resistance and hardness. The residual stress distribution along the thickness is unlikely to be constant with the inner layers being more stressed due to a greater amount of thermal differential strain. Following this guideline, a series of numerical simulations was performed in order to calculate the residual stress through thickness distribution due to the deposition process. Three sets of multilayered Ti/TiN coatings having both constant and variable Ti interlayer thickness were modelled and deposited, using a reactive arc PVD process. Mechanical and turbological properties were characterized using static and depth sensing Vickers <b>micro-hardness</b> <b>indentation</b> tests, rotating wheel (dimpling grinder) abrasive wear tests and Rockwell C adhesion tests. Coating interface characterizations were made by SEM-EDS. Results showed that adhesion can be significantly improved by adopting a titanium through thickness quantity increasing towards the interface: an optimized distribution allows also higher hardness and wear resistance to be obtained, as it requires a lower total amount of titanium to obtain good adhesion properties.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of high speed laser surface modification on 316 L stainless steel and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V for biomedical implants application. Laser processing {{was carried out in}} an inert argon environment using a 1. 5 kW CO 2 laser. Parameters investigated in this work included irradiance, residence time, pulse width and sample pre-treatments. Surface topology, microstructure and melt pool depth were characterised using the scanning electron microscope. White light interferometry and stylus profilometry were used to determine the surface roughness. X-ray diffractometry was used to investigate the crystallinity and phase transformation induced by the laser treatment. Micro-hardness was measured using a Vickers <b>micro-hardness</b> <b>indentation</b> apparatus. Wear behaviour was investigated using a pin on disk apparatus. Corrosion behaviour was evaluated using a potentiostat and an electrochemical cell set-up simulating human body conditions. Biocompatibility of the samples was investigated in vitro by monitoring NIH/ 3 T 3 fibroblast and MC 3 T 3 -E 1 osteoblast cell growth via MTT and Hoechst DNA assays. A strong correlation between irradiance, residence time, depth of processing and roughness was established in 316 L. High depth of altered microstructure and increased roughness were linked to higher levels of both irradiance and residence times. At fixed energy density, increase in residence time resulted in growth of the melt pool. In the melted region, a uniform composition in microstructure with fewer impurities was observed. In Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy, laser treatment resulted in crack-free layers, twenty to fifty microns thick. With increase in both irradiance and residence time, surface roughness was found to decrease while melt pool depth increased. A martensite structure formed on the laser treated region producing acicular αTi nested within the aged βTi matrix. The βTi phase volume fraction was reduced by up to 19 %. Microhardness increased up to 760 HV 0. 05 which represented a 67 % increase compared to the bulk material. A homogenous chemical composition of the alloying elements was achieved in laser modified regions. Much lower levels of wear were noted in laser treated samples compared to untreated samples. Stable passive polarisation behaviour and reduction in corrosion rates was noted in treated samples ranging between 86 and 239 nm yr- 1 compared to 108 nm yr- 1 for untreated samples and 309 nm yr- 1 for grit blast samples. Direct contact assays showed that laser treated samples had improved cytotoxicity properties compared to their untreated counterparts...|$|E
40|$|Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) {{have great}} {{potentials}} for Field Electron Emission (FEE) and Flow Boiling Heat Transfer (FBHT) applications. However, their weak adhesion on metallic substrates limits {{the development of}} CNTs in both applications. Diamond has high thermal conductivity and develops strong bonding with CNTs. The development of a diamond interlayer between CNTs and substrates is a feasible approach to address the adhesion problems. The purpose {{of this research was}} to develop a new CNT-based materials with a diamond interlayer for FEE and FBHT applications by focusing on four objectives: (1) enhancement of diamond thin film adhesion on a Cu substrate, (2) improvement of the CNT FEE stability, (3) reduction of the CNT FEE turn-on field, and (4) investigation of the FBHT performance of CNT based structures. The CNTs and diamond thin films in this thesis were prepared by Microwave Plasma enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (MPCVD) and Hot Filament enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (HFCVD). The structure and chemical states of the diamond films and CNTs were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), cross-sectional Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron based X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). To deposit diamond thin films on a Cu substrate with sufficient adhesion strength, a sandblasting pretreatment and alloying with a tiny amount of Al were investigated. The adhesion of diamond thin films to substrates was evaluated by Vickers <b>micro-hardness</b> <b>indentation.</b> The FEE stability and turn-on field were measured by a Keithley 237 high voltage measuring unit. The FBHT property of the structures was tested repeatedly at different flow velocities to explore the dependence of heat transfer performance on certain parameters, including the flow patterns, Critical Heat Flux (CHF), and stability. The results show that sandblasting pretreatment increases the surface roughness and surface defect density, thereby increasing diamond nucleation density and adhesion to the Cu substrate. Al alloying appears to inhibit the formation of graphite at the interface between diamond and the Cu substrate, which improves the chemical bonding between diamond and the Cu substrate and increases the adhesion strength between them. The FEE testing results show that ultra-high FEE stability (more than 5000 minutes) was achieved for the CNTs with a diamond interlayer. This is attributed to the good contact at the diamond-CNT and diamond-substrate interfaces. The main factors that affect the CNT FEE turn-on field were also studied. By optimizing the structure, an FEE turn-on field of 5. 1 V/μm was achieved and an emission barrier model for CNTs with a diamond interlayer on Cu substrate was used to explain the results. FBHT testing was done on CNTs with different structures and the results show that high heat transfer efficiency can be achieved on CNTs with a diamond interlayer at low mass fluxes...|$|E
