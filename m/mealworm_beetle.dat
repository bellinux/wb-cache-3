The bark beetle Pityogenes chalcographus can survive [...] whilst overwintering beneath tree bark; the Alaskan beetle Cucujus clavipes puniceus is able to withstand its larvae may survive [...] At these low temperatures, the formation of ice crystals in internal fluids is the biggest threat to survival to beetles, but this is prevented through the production of antifreeze proteins that stop water molecules from grouping together. The low temperatures experienced by Cucujus clavipes can be survived through their deliberate dehydration in conjunction with the antifreeze proteins. This concentrates the antifreezes several fold. The hemolymph of the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle</b> Tenebrio molitor contains several antifreeze proteins. The Alaskan beetle Upis ceramboides can survive −60°C: its cryoprotectants are xylomannan, a molecule consisting of a sugar bound to a fatty acid, and the sugar-alcohol, threitol.|$|E

40|$|During copulation, male insects pass {{accessory}} gland {{components to}} the female with the spermatophore. These gifts can affect female reproductive behaviour, ovulation and oviposition. Here, we show that female <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetles,</b> Tenebrio molitor, mated with males infected with metacestodes of the rat tapeworm, Hymenolepis diminuta, produced significantly more offspring than those mated with uninfected males. There is a significant positive relationship between parasite intensity in the male and reproductive output in the female. Infection results in {{a significant increase in}} bean-shaped accessory gland (BAG) size. We suggest that infected males pass superior nuptial gifts to females and discuss the confounding effects of infection in male and female beetles upon overall fitness costs of infection for the host and the likelihood that the parasite is manipulating host investment in reproduction...|$|R

In this study, we tested whether encapsulation response against nylon monofilament increases between two attempts of activation of immune system in <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetles</b> Tenebrio molitor, and whether previous exposure to nylon monofilament may also increase protection against an entomopathogenic fungus. We found that survival of beetles subjected to immune activation by nylon implant and subsequent fungal exposure {{a week later}} {{was significantly higher than}} survival of beetles which had been subjected to fungal infection only. This result suggests that previous immune activation by the nylon implant may be considered as broad spectrum “immune priming ” which helps to fight not only the same intruder but also other parasites.

50|$|Mealworms are the {{larval form}} of the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tenebrio molitor, a species of darkling beetle. Like all {{holometabolic}} insects, they go through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.

The antennae are paler at the tips and are covered in tiny, yellowish hairs. The elytra have shallow longitudinal grooves.|$|E
40|$|Encapsulation is a nonspecific, {{cellular}} response {{through which}} insects {{defend themselves against}} multicellular pathogens. During this immune reaction, haemocytes recognize an object as foreign and cause other haemocytes to aggregate and form a capsule around the object, often consisting of melanized cells. The process of melanisation is accompanied by the formation of potentially toxic reactive oxygen species, which can kill not only pathogens but also host cells. In this study we tested whether the encapsulation response is costly in <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetles</b> Tenebrio molitor. We found a negative relationship between the duration of implantation via a nylon monofilament and remaining life span. We also found a negative relationship between the strength of immune response and remaining life span, suggesting that cellular immunity is costly in T. molitor, {{and that there is}} a trade-off between immune response and remaining life span. However, this relationship disappeared at 31 - 32 hours of implantation at 25 ± 2 ℃. As the disappearance of a relationship between duration of implantation and lifespan coincided with the highest values of encapsulation response, we concluded that the beetles stopped investment in the production of melanotic cells, as the implant, a synthetic parasite, was fully isolated from the host’s tissues [Current Zoology 59 (3) : 340 – 346, 2013]...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we used a}} biologically {{relevant}} experimental {{procedure to}} ask whether meal-worm beetles (Tenebrio molitor) are spontaneously capable of assessing quantities based on numerical cues. Like other insect species, <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetles</b> adjust their reproduc-tive behavior (i. e., investment in mate guarding) according to the perceived risk of sperm competition (i. e., probability that a female will mate with another male). To test whether males {{have the ability to}} estimate numerosity based on numerical cues, we staged mat-ings between virgin females and virgin males in which we varied the number of rival males the experimental male had access to immediately preceding mating as a cue to sperm competition risk (from 1 to 4). Rival males were presented sequentially, and we controlled for continuous cues by ensuring that males in all treatments were exposed to the same amount of male–male contact. Males exhibited a marked increase in the time they devoted to mate guarding in response to {{an increase in the number}} of different rival males they were exposed to. Since males could not rely on continuous cues we conclude that they kept a running tally of the number of individuals they encountered serially, which meets the requirements of the basic ordinality and cardinality principles of proto-counting.

40|$|The {{opportunity}} for selection (I) {{is defined as}} the variance in relative fitness and sets the upper limit for the intensity of selection on any given trait. For Poisson or binomial fitness variables such as mating success or survival, I is mathematically dependent upon both mean fitness and sample size. Covariation with both mean mating success (x̄) and the number of individuals competing for mates (n) is typical of most indices of inequality (i. e. indices of spatial dispersion, resource monopolization and reproductive skew) and confounds comparisons among popu-lations. Several standardized indices of inequality have been developed that remove the con-founding influence of x ̄ and n. We assessed the utility of these standardized indices as measures of the potential for sexual selection on male <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetles.</b> Specifically, we compared the {{opportunity for}} sexual selection (Is) with the index of resource monopolization (Q), Morisita’s index (Iδ) and the standardized Morisita index (Ip). We estimated male mating success from repeated scan samples in two separate experiments. Experiment 1 comprised nine treatments with all combinations of 10, 20 or 30 males and females, replicated three times for a total of 27 populations.

It {{may be possible to}} use plant-derived products as D. gallinae repellents, especially if such products have a minimal impact on non-target organisms. An experiment was conducted with D. gallinae to assess the repellence of a range of plant essential oils, previously found to be of varying toxicity (relatively highly toxic to non-toxic) to this pest. Experiments were also undertaken to assess the toxicity of these products to <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetles</b> (Tenebrio molitor L.), a non-target invertebrate typical of poultry production systems. Results showed that all seven essential oils tested (manuka, thyme, palmarosa, caraway, spearmint, black pepper and juniper leaf) were repellent to D. gallinae at 0. 14 mg oil/cm 3 (initial concentration) during the first 2 days of study. Thyme essential oil appeared to be the most effective, where repellence lasted {{until the end of the}} study period (13 days). At the same concentration toxicity to T. molitor differed, with essential oils of palmarosa and manuka being no more toxic to adult beetles than the control.

40|$|Managing stored {{grains and}} seed {{requires}} {{the use of}} various techniques to ensure the quality of the product entering the storage facility does not deteriorate over time. These techniques include: the use of sanitation, storing sound, dry grain, managing temperature and aeration, using chemical protectants, regular sampling, and the use of fumigation. Bin and storage facilities also {{play an important role in}} determining the quality of the stored grain. Storage facilities should be inspected regularly for deterioration of any type. Proper storage moisture varies depending on type of seed, length of storage and storage conditions. Seed moisture content changes until equilibrium is established with the surrounding environment. The equilibrium moisture is different for each kind of seed. High oil content seeds (soybeans, peanuts, sunflowers) will not absorb as much moisture as seed with a high starch content (wheat, barley, corn, sorghum). Oil does not absorb water; therefore, in a seed with 40 % oil the seed moisture will be concentrated in the other 60 %. The time to reach equilibrium will vary from days to months depending on the kind of seed, humidity and temperature. When there are large differences in seed moisture and the surrounding environment the initial change is rapid and slows as equilibrium temperature/moisture is approached.

These antifreeze proteins are thought to stabilize SCPs by binding directly to the surface structures of the ice crystals themselves, diminishing crystal size and growth. [...] Therefore, instead of acting to change the biochemistry of the bodily fluids as seen with cryoprotectants, THFs act directly with the ice crystals by adsorbing to the developing crystals to inhibit their growth and reduce the chance of lethal freezing occurring.|$|E

The aim of our experiment was to study the elemental composition in three larvae, pupae and first and second generation adult stages during their life cycle. We selected 180 larvae from a genetically similar population and put them in three groups, in two boxes (60 larvae in each box). Larvae were fed with mashed potato made of the same quality and quantity of potato powder. Then, we selected 10 individuals from each stage to the elemental analysis, using the ICP-OES method. The following elements were analysed in the studied stages: Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, S, Sr and Zn. The results of principal component analysis demonstrated that based on elemental composition, different stages were separated with each other, but in the cases of the three larvae stages, high overlap was found. The results of the GLM ANOVA showed significant differences between the different stages of metamorphosis-based elemental composition. Our results show that the calcium and magnesium were found in a relatively high concentration, while the iron and zinc may be essential elements during the metamorphosis. Our results also show that in insect, the concentration of sodium was higher than in the pupa which may cause by hemolymph.

40|$|ABSTRACT Air {{temperature}} and relative humidity (RH) in the manure pits of five central Pennsylvania high-rise poultry houses were measured {{for at least}} one year to evaluate the role of the pit environment in the development of manure breeding flies and litter beetles. Pit air temperatures had weekly means ranging between 18. 1 and 22. 2 C. Seasonal temperature trends were similar at all farms, decreasing in winter and rising in summer. Maximum pit temperatures ranged from 31. 7 to 33. 3 C and minimum temperatures from. 6 to 5. 6 C, but these extremes were rare. Three houses had weekly mean RH ca 65 %, one ca 61 %, and one ca 72 %. No seasonal RH trends were evident. Daily temperature fluctuations were lowest at ca 0600 to 0700 h, peaked ca 1700 h, and varied inversely with RH. Pit air temperatures dropped below house fly reproductive thresholds for several weeks during the winter, but were adequate for their survival all year around. Manure temperatures were affected by the shape of the manure pile, depth of the manure, and seasonal air temperature patterns. Manure temperatures differed significantly between houses with either shallow (without scraper boards, x ca 16 to 19 C) or deep (with scraper boards, x ca 30 to 40 C) manure profiles.

Defensins are an evolutionarily-conserved class of AMPs and a potential new source of antimicrobial agents. In this context, we report the antimicrobial activity, phylogenetic and structural properties of three T. castaneum defensins (Def 1, Def 2 and Def 3) and their relevance in the immunity of T. castaneum against bacterial pathogens. All three recombinant defensins showed bactericidal activity against Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus thuringiensis serovar tolworthi, but only Def 1 and Def 2 showed a bacteriostatic effect against Staphylococcus epidermidis. None of the defensins showed activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas entomophila or against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

40|$|Fusarium {{species are}} known for their {{abundance}} in nature and their diverse associations with both living and dead plants and animals. Among animals Fusarium is found primarily in relationship with insects. This literature review of the past 50 years includes both non-pathogenic and pathogenic relationships between Fusarium and insects. Special attention is given to the host range, particularly between plant- and insecthosts, and to the possible microbial potential of the fungus to control insect pests. Correct classification of this fungus has been difficult because of its diverse and non-uniform morphological features. However, by now a usable and reliable taxonomic system has been developed. The fungus can be easily cultured and mass produced. Among the non-pathogenic associations mutualism and allotrophy are found between Fusarium and wood-inhabiting and flour beetles, respectively, enhancing development and production of beetle larvae. Some insects contribute to the dispersal of the fungus in the environment by means of spore passage through their guts. Plant-pathogenic Fusarium species gain easy access to host tissue by plant-feeding insects. A large number of Fusarium spp. are entomopathogenic; some are weak, facultative pathogens, especially of the lepidopteran and coleopteran orders, and they will colonize their dead hosts as saprophytes. In a few cases pathogenicity to both plant and insect by one isolate was found. Strong pathogens were reported primarily from homopterans and dipterans from field observations of natural mortalities as well as from pathogenicity tests. Potential Fusarium isolates which cause high insect mortalities also show high host specificity and no damage to crop plants. The question of host invasion has been addressed by few investigators. Entrance of the fungus via the oral route, oviposition tubes, wounds, or ectoparasitic activity, were stated, but no claim for penetration of the insect cuticle. Mycotoxins, such as trichothecenes (T- 2) and other secondary metabolites, contributed to mortalities of termites, <b>mealworms,</b> flour <b>beetles,</b> maize borers and blow flies, while zearalenone (F- 2) exhibited a beneficial effect on egg production in flour beetles and a detrimental effect on fecundity in mammals.
