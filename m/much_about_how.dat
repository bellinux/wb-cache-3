Wood sometimes threw a knuckleball upon his arrival in Chicago, but Wilhelm encouraged him to throw it full-time. By 1968, Wood won 13 games, saved 16 games and earned a 1.87 ERA. He credited Wilhelm with helping him to master the knuckleball, as the White Sox coaches did not know <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to throw it. Between 1968 and 1970, Wood pitched in more games (241) than any other pitcher and more innings (...) than any other relief pitcher.|$|E

[...] Most users access the system from institutes of higher education, whose IP address can easily {{be used to determine}} the user's geographical location. [...] Studies reveal that the highest per-capita users of ADS are France and Netherlands-based astronomers, and while more developed countries (measured by GDP per capita) use the system more than less developed countries; the relationship between GDP per capita and ADS use is not linear. The range of ADS usage per capita far exceeds the range of GDPs per capita, and basic research carried out in a country, as measured by ADS usage, {{has been found to be}} proportional to the square of the country's GDP divided by its population.|$|E

This was made public, and rumors spread that Norton [...] "made it clear he won't cooperate with publicity plans if he's not happy with the final product". Norton dismissed this, [...] "Our healthy process , which is and should be a private matter, was misrepresented publicly as a 'dispute', seized on by people looking for a good story, and has been distorted {{to such a degree that}} it risks distracting from the film itself, which Marvel, Universal and I refuse to let happen. It has always been my firm conviction that films should speak for themselves and that knowing too <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> they are made diminishes the magic of watching them." ...|$|E
500|$|Schwarzkopf {{sought to}} change the {{relationship}} between journalists and the military, feeling that the news media's negative portrayal of the Vietnam War had degraded troops there. When he took command during the Gulf War, he sought an entirely different strategy which was ultimately successful, where he favored greater media coverage, albeit subject to strict controls on the battlefield. Schwarzkopf favored the intense press surrounding the Gulf War conflict, feeling that blocking the news media as had been done in Grenada would contribute to negative public perception {{of the war in}} the United States. His dealings with the press were thus frequent and very personal, and he conducted regular briefings for journalists. He would usually not attack media coverage, even negative coverage, unless he felt it was blatantly incorrect. He staged visible media appearances which played to patriotism. In fact, Schwarzkopf believed extensive press coverage would help build public support for the war and raise morale. In some press conferences, he showed and explained advanced war-fighting technology the U.S. possessed to impress the public. These also had the side effect of distracting the public from focusing on U.S. casualty counts or the destruction wrought in the war. Schwarzkopf's strategy was to control the message being sent, he therefore ordered media on the battlefield to be escorted at all times. In spite of this, several high-profile reports publicized the CENTCOM strategy. [...] After the war Schwarzkopf was very critical of military analysts who scrutinized his operation, feeling that some of them were poorly informed on the factors involved in his planning, and that others were violating operational security by revealing too <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> he might plan the operation.|$|E

The steadfast, ongoing refusal of our leading media institutions to refer to what the Bush administration did as [...] "torture"– {{even in the face of}} more than 100 detainee deaths; the use of that term by a leading Bush official to describe what was done at Guantanamo; and the fact that media outlets frequently use the word [...] "torture" [...] to describe exactly the same methods when used by other countries – reveals <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the modern journalist thinks.|$|E

Buck likened Iron Fist to a mystery, saying, [...] "It’s very <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> do you go about proving who you are when there's no way to do that, and that's not just the story, that's also the theme of it, which is 'How do you go about proving who you are when no one knows, including yourself, what's happened to you?'" ...|$|E

In journal entries, the pair often wrote about {{events such as the}} Oklahoma City bombing, the Waco Siege, the Vietnam War, and other similar events, including blurbs and notes on how they wished to [...] "outdo" [...] these events, focusing especially on what Timothy McVeigh did in Oklahoma City. They mentioned how they would like to leave a lasting impression on the world with this kind of violence. That the shooters initially planned and failed to blow up the high school, and not just shoot students, is an indication of how they had wished to overshadow the events that had occurred, respectively, four and six years earlier.|$|E
2500|$|The Encyclopedia {{databases}} are <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> problems, strategies, values, development concepts, {{and organizations}} are linked together. As a result, {{the possibility of}} focusing on feedback loops {{has proven to be}} an important feature of the Encyclopedia, and a program has been carried out to identify [...] "vicious problem loops". A vicious problem loop is a chain of problems, each aggravating the next, and with the last looping back to aggravate the first in the chain. [...] Here is an example: Man-made disasters, Vulnerability of ecosystem niches, Natural environment degradation, Shortage of natural resources, Unbridled competition for scarce resources, Man-made disasters. Solutions that focus on only one problem in a chain may fail or even be harmful, because the cycle has the capacity to regenerate itself, and also because several cycles may interlock, forming tangled skeins of interlinked global problems. The loop detection program detected more than 50,000 loops (of up to 9 elements) in more than 12,000 problem profiles. It is thought that a similar work could be done about mutually facilitating or constraining strategy loops, so as to constitute a dynamic response to aggravating or reducing loops of problems through a circle of matching strategies.|$|E
