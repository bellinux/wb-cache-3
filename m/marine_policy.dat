Duke's interest in the area began in the early 1930s and the first buildings were erected in 1938. The resident faculty represent the disciplines of oceanography, marine biology, marine biomedicine, marine biotechnology, and coastal <b>marine</b> <b>policy</b> and management.

40|$|Marine {{governance}} {{is challenged}} by complex situations at regional seas and coastal areas of European countries where multiple stakeholder interests and numerous management options {{have to be}} balanced. In these situations an improved understanding of marine governance is crucial for ensuring sustainable development at sea. The main aim of this synthesis article is to increase present understanding of processes of regionalization in EU marine governance based on the contributions in this special issue. Regionalization {{is defined as the}} integration and cooperation of maritime activities, policies and actors {{at the level of the}} regional seas. The contributions in this special issue analyse processes of regionalization within different maritime sectors from a diversity of social scientific disciplines to unravel different forms and types of regionalization in marine governance. The main finding is that there is still a relatively large mismatch between the vision on ecosystem-based management expressed in EU <b>marine</b> <b>policies</b> and the implementation of EBM within sectoral maritime activities. A reduction of such a gap between EU <b>marine</b> <b>policies</b> and sectoral management fully depends on efforts at regional level to coordinate and to integrate the different sector policy processes...|$|R

In this paper we review the recent history of <b>marine</b> and coastal <b>policies</b> in Australia and, using specific examples, show that five elements of capacity-building, namely integrative place-making, collaborative policy-making, inclusive stakeholder involvement, and building relational resources, have emerged to some extent in Australian coastal and <b>marine</b> <b>policies</b> of the 1990 s.
