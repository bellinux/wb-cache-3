This study {{examined the relationship between}} abnormal medial calf perforating vein structure and function and the clinical severity of CVI. Methods: Duplex ultrasound was used as a means of determining the number, flow characteristics, and diameter of medial calf perforating veins, and the presence of deep and superficial main stem reflux or occlusion in 50 limbs with no clinical or duplex evidence of venous disease (clinical, etiological, anatomical, and pathological grade [CEAP] 0), 95 limbs with varicose veins only (CEAP 2 / 3), 58 limbs affected by lipodermatosclerosis but not ulcer (CEAP 4), and 108 limbs affected by healed or open venous ulcer (CEAP 5 / 6). Results: The proportion of limbs in which any perforating veins and incompetent perforating veins (IPVs) were demonstrated increased significantly with deteriorating clinical status (CEAP 0, 88 % and 6 %; CEAP 2 / 3, 95 % and 52 %; CEAP 4, 98 % and 83 %; and CEAP 5 / 6, 98 % and 90 %, respectively). The total number of perforators, the total number of IPVs, and the median diameters of perforators increased with deteriorating grade (CEAP 0 <b>median</b> <b>diameter,</b> 2 mm [interquartile range, 1 to 3 mm]; CEAP 2 / 3 <b>median</b> <b>diameter,</b> 3 mm [interquartile range, 2 to 4 mm]; CEAP 4 <b>median</b> <b>diameter,</b> 4 mm [interquartile range, 3 to 5 mm]; and CEAP 5 / 6 <b>median</b> <b>diameter,</b> 4 mm [interquartile range, 3 to 5 mm]).

40|$|Infants {{and young}} {{children}} are likely to present with subdural haemorrhage (SDH) if they {{are the victims of}} abusive head trauma. In these cases, the most accepted theory for the source of bleeding is the bridging veins traversing {{from the surface of the}} brain to the dura mater. However, some have suggested that SDH may result from leakage of blood from a dural vascular plexus. As post-mortem examination of the bridging veins and dura is challenging, and imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance and computed tomography do not have the resolution capabilities to image small blood vessels, we have trialled the use of intravascular and benchtop optical coherence tomography (OCT) systems for imaging from within the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and through the dura during five infant/perinatal autopsies. Numerous vessel-like structures were identified using both OCT systems. Measurements taken with the intravascular rotational system indicate that the approximate <b>median</b> <b>diameters</b> of blood vessels entering anterior and posterior segments of the SSS were 110  μm (range 70 to 670  μm, n =  21) and 125  μm (range 70 to 740  μm, n =  23), respectively.

40|$|An {{intensive}} {{particle monitoring}} {{study was conducted}} in homes in the Boston, Massachusetts, area during the winter and summer of 1996 in an effort to characterize sources of indoor particles. As part of this study, continuous particle size and mass concentration data were collected in four single-family homes, with each home monitored for one or two 6 -day periods. Additionally, housing activity and air exchange rate data were collected. Cooking, cleaning, and the movement of people were identified as the most important indoor particle sources in these homes. These sources contributed significantly both to indoor concentrations (indoor-outdoor ratios varied between 2 and 33) and to altered indoor particle size distributions. Cooking, including broiling/baking, toasting, and barbecuing contributed primarily to particulate matter with physical diameters between 0. 02 and 0. 5 microm [PM((0. 02 - 0. 5)) ], with volume <b>median</b> <b>diameters</b> of between 0. 13 and 0. 25 microm.

Frying was associated with particles from both PM((0. 02 - 0. 5)) and PM((0. 7 - 10)).

40|$|The {{method of}} {{simultaneously}} retrieving ice water path and mass <b>median</b> <b>diameter</b> using microwave data at two frequencies is examined and implemented for tropical nonprecipitating clouds. To develop the retrieval algorithm, the authors first derived a bulk mass–size relation for ice particles in tropical clouds based on microphysical data {{collected during the}} Central Equatorial Pacific Experiment. This relation effectively allows ice particle density to decrease with particle size. In implementing the retrieval algorithm, 150 - and 220 -GHz Millimeter-Wave Imaging Radiometer data collected during the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment were used. Ice water path and mass <b>median</b> <b>diameter</b> are determined based on a lookup table generated by a radiative transfer model.

40|$|Glyphosate {{is one of}} {{the most}} used {{herbicides}} in agricultural lands worldwide. Wind-eroded sediment and dust, as an environmental transport pathway of glyphosate and of its main metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), can result in environmental- and human exposure far beyond the agricultural areas where it has been applied. Therefore, special attention is required to the airborne transport of glyphosate and AMPA. In this study, we investigated the behavior of glyphosate and AMPA in wind-eroded sediment by measuring their content in different size fractions (<b>median</b> <b>diameters</b> between 715 and 8 μm) of a loess soil, during a period of 28 days after glyphosate application. Granulometrical extraction was done using a wind tunnel and a Soil Fine Particle Extractor. Extractions were conducted on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after glyphosate application. Results indicated that glyphosate and AMPA contents were significantly higher in the finest particle fractions (<b>median</b> <b>diameters</b> between 8 and 18 μm), and lowered significantly with the increase in particle size. However, their content remained constant when aggregates were present in the sample. Glyphosate and AMPA contents correlated positively with clay, organic matter, and silt content. The dissipation of glyphosate over time was very low, which was most probably due to the low soil moisture content of the sediment. Consequently, the formation of AMPA was also very low. The low dissipation of glyphosate in our study indicates that the risk of glyphosate transport in dry sediment to off-target areas by wind can be very high. The highest glyphosate and AMPA contents were found in the smallest soil fractions (PM 10 and less), which are easily inhaled and, therefore, contribute to human exposure...|$|R
