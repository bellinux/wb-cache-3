50|$|The {{lakes and}} rivers of the dry forest region are homes to most of Madagascar's bird species. Among reptiles, many {{chameleon}} and gecko species occur here, {{as well as the}} <b>Madagascar</b> <b>sideneck</b> <b>turtle</b> and the critically endangered ploughshare tortoise.|$|E
50|$|Hoge's <b>sideneck</b> <b>turtle</b> (Mesoclemmys hogei) is {{a species}} of turtle in the family Chelidae. The species is endemic to the Paraíba do Sul and Itapemirim River basins in {{southeast}} Brazil.|$|R
50|$|The red {{side-necked turtle}} (Rhinemys rufipes), red <b>turtle,</b> red-footed <b>sideneck</b> <b>turtle,</b> William’s toadhead turtle, or red-footed Amazon side-necked turtle is a {{monotypic}} species of turtle in the Chelidae family. It {{is found in}} Colombia and possibly Peru and Brazil.|$|R
5000|$|The black spine-neck swamp turtle (Acanthochelys spixii [...] ), also {{commonly}} known as the spiny-neck <b>turtle</b> or Spixs <b>sideneck</b> <b>turtle,</b> is a species of turtle in the family Chelidae. The species is endemic to Central America and northern South America.|$|R
50|$|The Chaco side-necked <b>turtle</b> or Chaco <b>sideneck</b> <b>turtle</b> (Acanthochelys pallidipectoris) is {{a species}} of turtle in the Chelidae family.It is found in Argentina, Paraguay, and {{possibly}} Bolivia.Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. The turtle possesses long horny spurs on its upper thighs. It is 18 cm in shell length. Like other members of its genus, the turtle bruies itself in the mud when the streams run dry, a behaviour possibly parallel to the winter hibernating behaviours of turtles further north.|$|R
5000|$|As {{taxonomic rank}} is only {{meaningful}} {{as part of}} a sequence (a biological [...] "family" [...] has no fixed meaning on its own), both treatments are technically correct. Ultimately, the issue hinges upon the Austro-American <b>sideneck</b> <b>turtles</b> (Chelidae). These Pleurodira are less closely related to the Podocnemididae and Pelomedusidae than these are to each other. If all three are ranked as full families, the Chelidae are treated as a basal lineage, while the other two are united in the superfamily Pelomedusoidea. This treatment is preferred here, because it allows more convenient placement of prehistoric pleurodires (e.g. the Bothremydidae).|$|R
50|$|The Baie de Baly National Park is {{the only}} known natural habitat of the {{critically}} endangered Angonoka tortoise or ploughshare tortoise (Astrochelys yniphora).Other rare animals found in this park is the Madagascan <b>sideneck</b> <b>turtle</b> (Erymnochelys madagascariensis), {{as well as the}} dugong, a marine mammal and the Madagascar fish eagle. There are also thirteen species of mammals, (six primates), 37 reptile species, eight amphibian species and 122 species of birds. There is also the Perrierbambus madagascariensis, an endemic bamboo. The poisonous tree, Erythrophleum couminga (locally named komanga) is also endemic to this region and can be found in and outside the park. It is a very hard wood but cannot be used for cooking as its fumes contain a poison.|$|R
