40|$|Chemotherapy is an {{established}} treatment modality for bone sarcomas such as osteosarcoma (OS). However, {{the use of}} chemotherapy in high-grade soft tissue sarcomas remains controversial, with the most active chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin (DOX), reported to have a response rate of, at best only 34 % and <b>most</b> <b>studies</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>lower</b> response rates. Apo 2 L/TRAIL {{is a member of}} the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) family of cytokines and induces death of tumour cells, but not normal cells. Its potent apoptotic activity is mediated through cell surface death domain-containing receptors, DR 4 /TRAIL-R 1 and DR 5 /TRAIL-R 2. We investigated the efficacy of Apo 2 L/TRAIL as a single agent, and in combination with clinically relevant chemotherapeutic drugs, in fresh isolates of primary malignant cells obtained from biopsy material. The data presented here demonstrate that, in a range of primary bone related tumours, as well as soft tissue sarcomas, chemotherapeutic agents were only moderately effective, in terms of induction of cell death. Apo 2 L/TRAIL alone had little or no effect on any bone-related tumour or sarcoma in culture. In contrast, the combination of Apo 2 L/TRAIL and chemotherapeutic drugs produced a significant increase in tumour cell death, with DOX and Apo 2 L/TRAIL proving to be the most effective combination. These data suggest the potential for Apo 2 L/TRAIL to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs in bone and soft tissue sarcomas, while perhaps concurrently allowing a reduction in the exposure to drugs such as DOX, and a consequent reduction in toxicity. The synergistic action between these two different classes of agents has yet to be tested in vivo but may prove clinically relevant in the treatment of this refractive class of malignancies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevention}} of mother to child transmission of HIV {{has resulted in}} reduced burden of pediatric HIV-infection, but the prevalence of maternal HIV infection remains high in sub-Saharan African countries. HIV-exposed-uninfected infants have {{an increased risk of}} morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases than HIV-unexposed infants, particularly during {{the first six months of}} life, which in part might be due to lower levels of pathogen-specific protective antibodies acquired transplacentally from their mothers. This could be mitigated by vaccinating pregnant women to boost antibody levels; although vaccine responses among HIV-infected pregnant women might differ compared to HIV-uninfected women. We reviewed studies that compared natural and vaccine-induced antibody levels to different epitopes between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected pregnant women. Findings <b>Most</b> <b>studies</b> <b>reported</b> <b>lower</b> baseline/pre-vaccination antibody levels in HIV-infected pregnant women, which may not be reversed by antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. There were only few studies on vaccination of HIV-infected pregnant women, mainly on influenza virus and group B Streptococcus (GBS) vaccines. Immunogenicity studies on influenza vaccines indicated that HIV-infected pregnant women had lower vaccine induced hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers and a decreased likelihood of seroconversion compared to HIV-uninfected women; and while higher CD 4 + T-lymphocyte levels were associated with better immune responses to vaccination, HIV viral load was not associated with responses. Furthermore, infants born to influenza vaccinated HIV-infected pregnant women also had lower antibody levels and a lower proportion of HIV-exposed infants had titers above the putative correlate of protection compared to HIV-unexposed infants. The immunogenicity of a CRM 197 -conjugated trivalent GBS vaccine was also lower in HIV-infected pregnant women compared to HIV-uninfected women, irrespective of CD 4 + T-lymphocyte counts. Conclusions Poorer immunogenicity of vaccines reported in HIV-infected compared to HIV-uninfected pregnant women might compromise the potential benefits to their young infants. Alternate vaccination strategies, including vaccines with higher antigen concentration, adjuvanted vaccines or multiple doses schedules might be required in HIV-infected pregnant women to optimize antibody transferred to their fetuses...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Children and {{adolescents}} born extremely preterm (EP) have lower {{dynamic lung volumes}} and gas transfer capacity than subjects born at term. <b>Most</b> <b>studies</b> also <b>report</b> <b>lower</b> aerobic capacity. We hypothesized that ventilatory efficiency was poorer and that breathing patterns differed in EP−born compared to term−born individuals. Methods: Two area−based cohorts of participants born with gestational age ≤ 28 weeks or birth weight ≤ 1000 g in 1982 − 85 (n = 46) and 1991 – 92 (n = 35) were compared with individually matched controls born at term. Mean ages were 18 and 10 years, respectively. The participants performed an incremental treadmill exercise test to peak oxygen uptake with data averaged over 20 s intervals. For each participant, the relationship between exhaled minute ventilation (V˙E) and carbon dioxide output (V˙CO 2) was described by a linear model, {{and the relationship between}} tidal volume (VT) and V˙E by a quadratic model. Multivariate regression analyses were done with curve parameters as dependent variables, and the categories EP vs. term−born, sex, age, height, weight and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) as independent variables. Results: In adjusted analyses, the slope of the V˙E−V˙CO 2 relationship was significantly steeper in the EP than the term-born group, whereas no group difference was observed for the breathing pattern, which was related to FEV 1 only. Conclusion: EP-born participants breathed with higher V˙E for any given CO 2 output, indicating lower ventilatory efficiency, possibly contributing to lower aerobic capacity. The breathing patterns did not differ between the EP and term−born groups when adjusted for FEV 1...|$|R

Hamstrings strains are common injuries in various sports, particularly running, track and field and football [10, 11].
