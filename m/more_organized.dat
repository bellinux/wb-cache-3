The system was over somewhat cooler water at first with sea surface temperatures around 79°F (26°C); however, the low shear environment allowed the depression to continue to organize. Late that evening, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Danielle.|$|E

5|$|Late on December 29, {{more than}} four weeks after the {{official}} end to the season, a tropical disturbance developed in the east-central Atlantic. It quickly became <b>more</b> <b>organized</b> and was declared Tropical Depression Thirty on December 30. The next day, Thirty was declared a tropical storm naming it Zeta. Zeta made a turn toward the west but stalled and gradually weakened until dissipating on January 6, 2006.|$|E
5|$|On September 9 a {{tropical}} wave moved off the African coast and moved west into the Atlantic. It started to become <b>more</b> <b>organized</b> on September 13 and the National Hurricane Center began {{to watch it}} closely for further development. Tropical Depression Seventeen formed from the wave on September 17 when it was 350miles (560km) east of Barbados. The depression strengthened further to become Tropical Storm Philippe that evening, and the official forecasts correctly indicated that Philippe would move northwards and not approach the Lesser Antilles despite climatology suggesting {{an impact on the}} islands.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Nine-E was {{influenced}} by a high pressure area located over Mexico, causing it to move 16mph (26km/h) to the north-west. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Hernan overnight as the storm became <b>more</b> <b>organized.</b> Although Hernan was located over warm waters, moderate wind shear prevented the storm from intensifying quickly, and the storm slowed. Hernan slowly became better organized throughout the night, but wind shear continued to impair Hernan through the morning; as a result, most of the tropical cyclone forecast models did not predict Hernan to become a hurricane.|$|E

5|$|A {{powerful}} tropical wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 27. As it moved west into the Atlantic, it became <b>more</b> <b>organized</b> and the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles on September 1. Shear from an upper-level low to the southwest slowed the development of the storm and caused uncertainties in the National Hurricane Center's forecasts, as some models indicated that the depression would dissipate and others that it would become a hurricane. The depression gradually strengthened as it moved to the northwest across the open Atlantic Ocean, becoming Tropical Storm Maria on September 2 and reaching hurricane strength on September 4.|$|E
5|$|Although {{thunderstorm}} {{activity was}} initially minimal around {{the center of}} circulation, convective band associated with the depression was becoming <b>more</b> <b>organized.</b> Late on September10, convection began to increase slightly near the center, though because Dvorak intensity T-numbers were between 2.0 and 2.5, the depression was not upgraded to a tropical storm. However, dry air briefly caused showers and thunderstorms to decrease later that day. Initially, it headed just north of due west around the southern periphery of a large subtropical ridge. However, by September11, the depression re-curved northwestward. Later that day, the depression began to regain deep convection. Geostationary satellite imagery and scatterometer data indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine at 0000UTC on September12.|$|E
5|$|Around May6, {{the monsoon}} trough {{extended}} across the southern Bay of Bengal, producing a vast field of thunderstorm activity.

Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became <b>more</b> <b>organized,</b> giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane. However, Durkheim also believed that religion was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by science and the cult of an individual.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{continued}} to intensify throughout the afternoon {{as the storm}} became more symmetrical. However, due {{to the location of}} the storm, {{there was a lack of}} accurate wind speed readings, and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity. Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm, the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification. The storm was also heading into an area where shear was forecasted to significantly increase due to an upper-level trough diving southward. Despite convection being partially removed from the center of Josephine, the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became <b>more</b> <b>organized.</b> The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening, causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{reached its}} peak {{intensity}} of 65mph (100km/h) around 8 a.m. (EDT) as it continued to become <b>more</b> <b>organized.</b> However, there were indications that it {{had already begun to}} weaken. Outflow towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm, a sign that dry air was entering the system. During the afternoon hours, the structure of Josephine began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll. By the late night, the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center.|$|E

5|$|Marginal {{wind shear}} {{disrupted}} the system's organization, and it passed north of Puerto Rico without further development, with winds dropping below gale-force on August25. Initially, the system moved quickly westward with a forward speed averaging about , but slowed down considerably after the northern {{portion of the}} wave split off on August26. The low pressure area crossed the southern Bahamas with scattered convection, becoming more defined on August 27 while moving near the northern Cuban coast. Wind shear prevented quicker development, although conditions became more favorable closer to the Gulf of Mexico. On August 28, the convection increased and became <b>more</b> <b>organized.</b> Later that day, the Hurricane Hunters observed a well-defined circulation. Based on the observations and the convective organization, {{it is estimated that}} Tropical Depression Nine developed at 18:00UTC on August28 while situated about 60mi (100km) south-southeast of Key West, Florida.|$|E
5|$|On May20, {{following}} Typhoon Brenda's {{passage through}} the South China Sea, a monsoon trough extending from the area into the Bay of Bengal received enhanced low-level southwesterly flow. An environment of weak wind shear {{in the wake of}} the typhoon allowed a new area of low pressure to form within the southwesterly flow on May21. With convection becoming persistent and the system's overall presentation <b>more</b> <b>organized</b> by May22, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0300UTC. Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Later that day, convection wrapped entirely around the center of circulation; this structural improvement, combined with nearby surface observations, prompted the JTWC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Cecil.|$|E

The computer models initially predicted two distinct possibilities for the storm's future, with some models indicating the storm would cross over Florida and enter the Gulf of Mexico while others indicated that it would stay offshore {{and move to the}} northeast. The official forecast from the National Hurricane Center followed the first set of guidances, though with low confidence. The storm strengthened to become Tropical Storm Ophelia early on September 7 and became a hurricane briefly the next day.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Cyclone Bingiza {{were from a}} {{persistent}} area of disorganized convection on February8, about 880km (545mi) north-northeast of Réunion. At the time, the system consisted of a poorly defined circulation, located {{in an area of}} low wind shear. It moved west-southwestward along the northern periphery of a ridge, and its convection gradually became <b>more</b> <b>organized</b> over the center. On February9, Météo-France (MF) classified the system as Tropical Disturbance5, and six hours later upgraded it to a tropical depression. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert after convective banding and outflow increased. Following intensification of the depression into a moderate tropical storm, MF advised the Madagascan Weather Service to name the storm as Bingiza which they did late on February 9.|$|E
