6000|$|An {{enormous}} {{depression was}} weighing upon my spirits. The {{cumulative effect of}} all the dreadful sights which we had seen upon our journey was heavy upon my soul. With my abounding animal health and great physical energy any kind of <b>mental</b> <b>clouding</b> was a rare event. I had the Irish faculty of seeing some gleam of humor in every darkness. But now the obscurity was appalling and unrelieved. The others were downstairs making their plans for the future. I sat by the open window, my chin resting upon my hand and my mind absorbed in the misery of our situation. Could we continue to live? That was the question which I had begun to ask myself. Was it possible to exist upon a dead world? Just as in physics the greater body draws to itself the lesser, would we not feel an overpowering attraction from that vast body of humanity which had passed into the unknown? How would the end come? Would it be from a return of the poison? Or would the earth be uninhabitable from the mephitic products of universal decay? Or, finally, might our awful situation prey upon and unbalance our minds? A group of insane folk upon a dead world! My mind was brooding upon this last dreadful idea when some slight noise caused me to look down upon the road beneath me. The old cab horse was coming up the hill! ...|$|E
5000|$|Clouding of consciousness, {{also known}} as brain fog or mental fog, is a term used in {{medicine}} denoting an abnormality in the regulation of the overall level of consciousness that is mild and less severe than a delirium. The sufferer experiences a subjective sensation of <b>mental</b> <b>clouding</b> described as feeling [...] "foggy".|$|E
50|$|Hydromorphone is a semi-synthetic μ-opioid agonist. As a {{hydrogenated}} ketone of morphine, {{it shares}} the pharmacologic properties typical of opioid analgesics. Hydromorphone and related opioids produce their major {{effects on the}} central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. These include analgesia, drowsiness, <b>mental</b> <b>clouding,</b> changes in mood, euphoria or dysphoria, respiratory depression, cough suppression, decreased gastrointestinal motility, nausea, vomiting, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, increased biliary pressure, and increased pinpoint constriction of the pupils.|$|E
60|$|The hurry of {{dressing}} and starting left {{no time for}} more than this. Those words of his seemed to reassure her on further reflection. She was whirled onward through {{the next couple of}} critical hours by the mastering tide of her devotion to him, which closed up further meditation. Her one desire, so long resisted, to make herself his, to call him her lord, her own--then, if necessary, to die--had at last lifted her up from her plodding reflective pathway. In dressing, she moved about in a <b>mental</b> <b>cloud</b> of many-coloured idealities, which eclipsed all sinister contingencies by its brightness.|$|R
60|$|The <b>mental</b> <b>clouds</b> dispelled as Sybil {{felt the}} {{freshness}} and fragrance of nature. The colour {{came to her}} cheek; the deep brightness returned to her eye; her step that at first had been languid and if not melancholy, at least contemplative, became active and animated. She forgot the cares of life and was touched by all the sense of its enjoyment. To move, to breathe, to feel the sunbeam, were sensible and surpassing pleasures. Cheerful by nature, notwithstanding her stately thoughts and solemn life, a brilliant smile played on her seraphic face, as she marked the wild passage of the daring birds, or watched the thoughtless grace of infancy.|$|R
50|$|Kleshas (क्लेश; किलेस kilesa; ཉོན་མོངས། nyon mongs), in Buddhism, are <b>mental</b> {{states that}} <b>cloud</b> {{the mind and}} {{manifest}} in unwholesome actions. Kleshas include states of mind such as anxiety, fear, anger, jealousy, desire, depression, etc. Contemporary translators {{use a variety of}} English words to translate the term kleshas, such as: afflictions, defilements, destructive emotions, disturbing emotions, negative emotions, mind poisons, etc.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sufferer}} {{experiences a}} subjective sensation of <b>mental</b> <b>clouding</b> {{described in the}} patient's own words as feeling [...] "foggy". One sufferer described it as [...] "I thought it became like misty, in some way... the outlines were sort of fuzzy". Others may describe a [...] "spaced out" [...] feeling. Sufferers compare their overall experience {{to that of a}} dream because as in a dream consciousness, attention, orientation to time and place, perceptions, and awareness are disturbed. Barbara Schildkrout, MD, a board-certified psychiatrist and clinical instructor in psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School described her subjective experience of clouding of consciousness, or what she also called [...] "mental fog", after taking a single dose of the antihistamine chlorpheniramine for her cottonwood allergy while on a cross-country road trip. She described feeling [...] "out of it" [...] and being in a [...] "dreamy state". She described a sense of not trusting her own judgment and a dulled awareness, not knowing how long time went by. Clouding of consciousness {{is not the same thing}} as depersonalization even though both sufferers compare their experience to that of a dream. Psychometric tests produce little evidence of a relationship between clouding of consciousness and depersonalization.|$|E
40|$|Sedation and <b>mental</b> <b>clouding</b> are {{of concern}} to people on {{antipsychotic}} medication and are implicated in social withdrawal but their severity may be underestimated by psychiatrists. Existing studies of communication about adverse effects of medication are based on reports made by doctors or patients. This study is based on audiotapes of 92 outpatient consultations in two UK mental health trusts involving nine consultant psychiatrists where antipsychotic medication was discussed. When interviewed, these doctors and their colleagues had expressed a commitment to 'patient-centred' practice as well as recording concerns about the difficulties involved {{in the discussion of}} medication side effects. The study focuses on the ways in which sedation and <b>mental</b> <b>clouding</b> are presented and engaged with. Analysis of audiotape transcripts showed that patients raise these issues more often than doctors, contrasting with other adverse effects (such as blood changes) where doctors are more frequently the initiators of discussion. Sleepiness is sometimes presented by both patients and doctors as a part of normal experience and therefore to be welcomed. When presented as troublesome, patients' reports were sometimes met by doctors offering no response, changing the subject, or disagreeing with the patient's interpretation of the experience. Equally, there were some attempts by doctors to engage with patients' troubles and seek solutions. These could be unsuccessful where they involved challenges to the patients' medication-taking rationale, or more successful where they involved sympathetic and supportive listening. We speculate that the capacity to avoid addressing these problems is linked to the informal conversational style of these consultations, which means that concerns raised by one party can remain unaddressed without offending conversational norms. Doctors in these consultations are able to exercise considerable discretion over whether to define reports of sedation and <b>mental</b> <b>clouding</b> as medication-related problems.

40|$|Psychiatric expert {{testimony}} is challenging {{in cases of}} violence when the accused person submits a defence that he or shewas so overwhelmed by emotions triggered by an upsetting event {{that his or her}} violent behaviourwas an uncontrollable consequence of the emotions. This defence is usually presented in terms of an automatismparticularly not attributed to a <b>mental</b> disorder. <b>Clouding</b> testimony in these cases is the various definitions of both automatism and mental disorder—definitions by which the jurisprudential distinction is made between a sane and an insane automatism, or pathological and non-pathological incapacity (NPCI). To avert testimony that is tainted from the very beginning by the lack of agreed definitions, this article proposes that psychiatrists focus in their assessment and testimony on particularly the behaviour as being distinct fromthe jurisprudential concernswhether that behaviour constitutes an automatism andwhether it is (not) attributed to a mental disorder. This focus on the behaviour affords clarity by which the properties of the behaviour may be examined theoretically and clinically in terms of behaviour therapy, specifying accordingly its antecedents, consequences, topography, intensity, latency, duration, frequency, and quality. So informed, the behaviour that underpins NPCI and automatism is described here as emotionally triggered involuntary violent behaviour about which testimony may be given distinct from whether the behaviour is (not) causally attributed to a mental disorder, and from jurisprudential concerns with accountability.

40|$|Morphine is the {{principle}} alkaloid of opium and binds to many opioid-receptor sites of the central nervous system, altering the perception of pain and the emotional response to pain. Alterations in mood can include euphoria, dysphoria, drowsiness and <b>mental</b> <b>clouding.</b> There is almost no evidence supporting the efficacy or safety of intramuscular morphine in labour. SIDE EFFECTS Suppression of the cough reflex by effect on the medullary centre Respiratory depression due to reduced response in the respiratory centre to carbon dioxide. 4 Decreased gastric motility. Alterations of the endocrine and autonomic nervous system. 5 KEY POINTS 1. Animal studies suggest morphine reduces uterine response to oxytocin and the oxytocic release from the posterior pituitary gland. 3 2. Morphine causes relaxation of smooth muscle. 3 3. Morphine is rapidly transferred across the placenta, with the fetus and neonate excreting the opioids more slowly than adults due to the immaturity of the liver enzymes. ...|$|E

40|$|Object. Concussive head {{injuries}} have received much {{attention in the}} medical and public arenas, as concerns have been raised about the potential shortand long-term consequences of injuries sustained in sports and other activities. While many student athletes have required evaluation after concussion, the exact definition of concussion has varied among disciplines and over time. The authors used data gathered {{as part of a}} multiinstitutional longitudinal study of the biomechanics of head impacts in helmeted collegiate athletes to characterize what signs, symptoms, and clinical histories were used to designate players as having sustained concussions. Methods. Players on 3 college football teams and 4 ice hockey teams (male and female) wore helmets instrumented with Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) technology during practices and games over 2 – 4 seasons of play. Preseason clinical screening batteries assessed baseline cognition and reported symptoms. If a concussion was diagnosed by the team medical staff, basic descriptive information was collected at presentation, and concussed players were reevaluated serially. The specific symptoms or findings associated with the diagnosis of acute concussion, relation to specific impact events, timing of symptom onset and diagnosis, and recorded biomechanical parameters were analyzed. Results. Data were collected from 450 athletes with 486, 594 recorded head impacts. Forty-eight separate concussions were diagnosed in 44 individual players. <b>Mental</b> <b>clouding,</b> headache, and dizziness were the most common presenting symptoms. Thirty-one diagnosed cases were associated with an identified impact event; in 17 cases no specific impact event was identified. Onset of symptoms was immediate in 24 players, delayed in 11, and unspecified in 13. In 8 cases the diagnosis was made immediately after a head impact, but in most cases the diagnosis was delayed (median 17 hours). One diagnosed concussion involved a 30 -second loss of consciousness; all other players retained alertness. Most diagnoses were based on self-reported symptoms. The mean peak angular and rotational acceleration values for those cases associated with a specific identified impact were 86. 1 ± 42. 6 g (range 16. 5 – 177. 9 g) and 3620 ± 2166 rad/sec 2 (range 183 – 7589 rad/sec 2), respectively. Conclusions. Approximately two-thirds of diagnosed concussions were associated with a specific contact event. Half of all players diagnosed with concussions had delayed or unclear timing of onset of symptoms. Most had no externally observed findings. Diagnosis was usually based on a range of self-reported symptoms after a variable delay. Accelerations clustered in the higher percentiles for all impact events, but encompassed a wide range. These data highlight the heterogeneity of criteria for concussion diagnosis, and in this sports context, its heavy reliance on self-reported symptoms. More specific and standardized definitions of clinical and objective correlates of a “concussion spectrum” may be needed in future research efforts, {{as well as in the}} clinical diagnostic arena...|$|E
