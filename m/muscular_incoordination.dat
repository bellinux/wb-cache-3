50|$|Louping-ill (also {{known as}} Ovine Encephalomyelitis, Infectious Encephalomyelitis of Sheep, Trembling-ill) is an acute viral disease {{primarily}} of sheep that {{is characterized by}} a biphasic fever, depression, ataxia, <b>muscular</b> <b>incoordination,</b> tremors, posterior paralysis, coma, and death. Louping-ill is a tick-transmitted disease whose occurrence is closely related to the distribution of the primary vector, the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus. It also causes disease in red grouse, and can affect humans. The name 'louping-ill' is derived from an old Scottish word describing the effect of the disease in sheep whereby they 'loup' or spring into the air.|$|E

Degeneration of the medullary sheaths of the brachial plexuses and sciatic nerves, and less often of the vagus nerves. Such lesions were {{not found in the}} optic nerves. 2. Degeneration of the medullary sheaths of the sensory tracts {{on the periphery of the}} spinal cord and in the posterior columns. Much less frequently similar lesions were found in both the crossed and uncrossed pyramidal tracts. 3. Changes of the same nature in the posterior nerve roots and less frequently in the anterior nerve roots of the spinal cord. Evidence was adduced to indicate that the changes in the sensory tracts of the spinal cord followed those in the posterior nerve roots. With the onset of <b>muscular</b> weakness and <b>incoordination</b> in these animals anatomic changes like those just described were found at necropsy, but they were not present for any appreciable period preceding the onset of these clinical signs. For a short but undetermined period following clinical signs of recovery from the nervous disease, marked lesions were still present in the nervous system at necropsy. These lesions in the nervous system were produced by a ration containing no cereals which might have contributed a "toxic" substance to account for the degeneration of the myelin sheaths.

40|$|Two {{cases of}} paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning after ingestion of mussels occurred in October 1977 in Nova Scotia. The incidence {{of this type}} of poisoning is relatively high among persons living on the coast of the Bay of Fundy and the estuary of the St. Lawrence River. The causative organism, Gonyaulax tamarensis, elaborates an endotoxin, saxitoxin, that blocks neuromuscular transmission in the motor axon and muscle membrane while leaving the end-plate unaffected; it also suppresses conduction in the atrioventricular node and inhibits the respiratory centre. The clinical manifestations are unique and include numbness of the lips, tongue and fingertips within minutes of ingestion of the poisoned shellfish, then numbness of the legs, arms and neck, with general <b>muscular</b> <b>incoordination,</b> and finally respiratory distress and muscular paralysis.

40|$|Distillers grains with {{solubles}} {{are becoming}} {{an increasingly important}} staple of cattle diets because of rapid expansion of the fuel ethanol industry. Sulfuric acid often is used in ethanol production processes to clean and control the pH of fermenters. Consequently, distillers grains with solubles can occasionally contain high sulfur concentrations. Within the rumen, sulfur is converted to hydrogen sulfide gas by ruminal microbes. Hydrogen sulfide is eructated from the rumen and subsequently aspirated into the lungs; excess amounts of hydrogen sulfide can cause polioencephalomalacia (brainers). Polioencephalomalacia is characterized by increased respiration, decreased feed intake, listlessness, <b>muscular</b> <b>incoordination,</b> progressive blindness, and necrosis of brain tissue. Elevated sulfur levels also may have deleterious effects on cattle growth performance and carcass characteristics. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate effects of sulfur content in dried distillers grains with solubles on ruminal gas concentrations, feedlot performance, and carcass characteristics of finishing steers fed diets based on steam-flaked corn or dry-rolled corn...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Sickness {{occurred}} in 3 of 4 horses within 24 h of being sprayed with an 0. 025 % w/v aqueous suspension of amitraz. The latter {{consisted of a}} portion of an amitraz aqueous suspension made up some 3 weeks previously, to which some freshly prepared spray fluid had been added. It seemed likely that the amitraz in the older solution had broken down to the highly toxic N‐ 3, 5 ‐ dimethylphenyl N‐methyl formamadine derivative {{and that this was}} in fact the main cause of the untoward effects observed. The horses displayed typical clinical signs of tranquillisation, depression, ataxia, <b>muscular</b> <b>incoordination</b> and impaction colic lasting up to 6 days. Subcutaneous oedema of the face {{occurred in}} one horse. The syndrome was accompanied by mild dehydration and acidosis. All horses survived after persistent symptomatic treatment including the giving of intravenous fluids, enemas, analgesics every 3 h, multiple doses of paraffin oil per os and dexamethasone intravenously.

40|$|Frutos maduros, triturados, de Melia azedarach foram administrados misturados à ração a 8 suínos em doses únicas de 5 - 20 g/kg. Diarréia passageira foi o único sinal nos 2 suínos que consumiram 5 g/kg. Os sinais clínicos observados nos animais que ingeriram doses únicas de 10, 15 e 20 g/kg caracterizaram-se por incoordenação, tremores musculares, dificuldade para manter-se de pé, relutância para levantar-se, decúbito esternal e hipotermia. Os 2 suínos que ingeriram 20 g/kg morreram. Macroscopicamente observou-se congestão do intestino delgado e da mucosa do estômago. As alterações histológicas caracterizaram-se por discreta a moderada necrose do tecido linfático, necrose dos músculos esqueléticos, congestão e necrose da mucosa gástrica e do intestino delgado e alterações degenerativas moderadas no fígado e rim. Os níveis séricos de AST e CPK aumentaram após a ingestão do tóxico. Observaram-se valores altos de CPK nos animais que morreram, evidenciando a mionecrose. Os resultados obtidos demonstram que, para suínos, a ingestão de altas doses de frutos de Melia azedarach induz ao aparecimento de sinais clínicos da intoxicação e causa lesões em diversos órgãos, {{inclusive}} a morte. Mature ground {{fruits of}} Melia azedarach were administered {{mixed with the}} food to 8 pigs at single doses of 5 - 20 g/kg. Transient diarrhea was the only sign observed in the 2 pigs that ingested 5 g/kg. Clinical signs observed in the pigs that ingested 10, 15 and 20 g/kg were <b>incoordination,</b> <b>muscular</b> tremors, difficulty to stand or to get up, sternal decubitus and hypothermia. The 2 pigs that ingested 20 g/kg died. The gross lesions were congestion and necrosis of the small intestine and the stomach mucosa. The microscopic alterations were characterised by necrosis of the lymphatic tissues and skeletal muscles, congestion and necrosis of the stomach and small intestine, and moderate degenerative alterations of liver and kidneys. The serum levels of AST and CPK increased after the ingestion of the toxic fruits. High values of CPK were observed in the succumbing animals due to the muscle necrosis. These results demonstrate that the ingestion of high doses of Melia azedarach fruits by pigs may induce clinical signs of poisoning and cause lesions in several organs and even death...|$|R
40|$|Descreve-se um surto de intoxicação por Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers. no município de Santa Luzia, semi-árido da Paraíba. Nove bovinos foram colocados numa pastagem com S. halepense em fase de rebrota, com 25 - 30 cm de altura, 15 dias após as primeiras chuvas. Sinais clínicos de dispnéia, ansiedade, tremores musculares e incoordenação apareceram 10 - 15 minutos após a ingestão. Dois animais morreram em um período aproximado de 3 horas. Na necropsia observaram-se congestão e cianose das mucosas, musculatura escura, pulmão com pontos hemorrágicos e edema, além de folhas da planta no rúmen. A planta foi positiva no teste do papel picrosódico. Mudas de S. halepense coletadas no Município de Currais Novos, Rio Grande do Norte, onde havia históricos de uma intoxicação semelhante, foram plantadas em vasos e realizado o teste de papel picrosódico a cada 15 dias. A planta foi positiva para HCN durante todos os estágios, sendo que nos primeiros 45 dias a reação ocorreu dentro de 1 minuto e, posteriormente, em até 3 minutos. Trinta dias após ter sido plantada, a planta de um dos vasos foi administrada a um caprino causando sinais característicos de intoxicação cianídrica na dose de 11, 8 g/kg de peso do animal. O caprino se recuperou após tratamento com uma solução de tiossulfato de sódio a 20 % na dose de 5 mL/ 10 kg. No semi-árido, S. halepense é freqüentemente encontrado como invasora em beiras de açudes e culturas irrigadas, sendo utilizado como forrageira, na época seca, em áreas de vazante. An {{outbreak}} of poisoning by Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers. in cattle in the Brazilian semiarid is reported. Nine cattle were introduced 15 {{days after the}} first rains into a paddock where the plant was sprouting and had 25 - 30 cm high. Clinical signs of dyspnea, anxiety, <b>muscular</b> tremors and <b>incoordination</b> appeared 15 minutes after the animals began to graze. Two of them died within about 3 hours. The others recovered. Cyanotic mucosa, dark muscles, lung edema and hemorrhages, and leaves of the plant in the rumen were observed at necropsy. The plant was positive for the picrosodic paper test. S. halepense from another farm of occurrence of the poisoning was transplanted into two pots. The picrosodic paper test was performed fortnightly in the plants growing in one of them. The plant was positive for cyanide in all growth stages; during the first 45 days the test was positive within 1 minute, but after day 60 within 3 minutes. Thirty days after the plant had been transplanted {{into one of the}} pots, it was administered to a goat at a dose of 11. 8 g/kg, causing clinical signs of HCN poisoning.

40|$|Abstract. Two female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and {{one female}} pigtailed macaque (M. nemestrina) {{developed}} acute neurological signs including ataxia, <b>muscular</b> <b>incoordination,</b> and seizures. Light microscopy showed Cowdry Type A intranuclear inclusion bodies in astrocytes and neurons of the cerebral cortex and Purkinje’s {{cells of the}} cerebellum. Many cells also had intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Electron microscopy identified paramyxoviral nucleocapsids in the intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions in two monkeys. We believe these monkeys had measles encephalitis because measles virus is the only paramyxovirus known to cause inclusion bodies in macaques and because the lesions in these monkeys resembled measles encephalitis in man. Nonhuman primates frequently seroconvert to measles virus after being captured, and clinical disease {{has been reported in}} several species [2, 12, 14, 151. Lesions usually occur in the s h n and the respiratory tract [9, 101. Neural lesions, described in only one monkey, were multifocal nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis of the brain stem, midbrain, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex [161. Neither syncytial giant cells nor inclusion bodies were found in the meninges or brain in this monkey, although they were seen in respiratory epithelium, hepatocytes, and endometrium 1161. We describe three cases of spontaneous paramyxoviral encephalitis, probably measles, in one pigtailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) and two rhesus macaques (174. mulatta) ...|$|E
40|$|Performing {{music at}} a {{professional}} level requires {{the integration of}} multimodal sensory and motor information and precise monitoring of the performance via auditory feedback. In the context of western classical music, musicians are forced to reproduce highly controlled movements almost perfectly with a high reliability. These specialized sensory-motor skills are acquired during extensive training periods over many years, starting in early infancy and passing through stages of increasing physical and strategic complexities. The superior skills of musicians are mirrored in plastic adaptations of the brain on different time scales (for a review, see: Münte et al. 2002). There is a dark side to the increasing specialisation and prolonged training of modern musicians, namely loss of control and degradation of skilled hand movements, a disorder referred to as musicians’ cramp or focal dystonia. In our musicians ’ clinic, we have seen 360 professional musicians with focal dystonia during the last 10 years. The disorder presents as painless <b>muscular</b> <b>incoordination</b> or loss of voluntary motor control of highly trained movements while playing the instrument. According to new research data, focal dystonia {{may be caused by}} training induced cortical dysplasticity with pathological fusion of somatosensory representations in sensory or motor cortical regions. Considering 1) the historical advent of the disorder in the nineteenth century with rapidly increasing technical demands imposed on musicians, 2) the epidemiological data with repetitive and spatiotemporally precise physical activity as a risk factor, and 3) neurobiological findings of the blurring of somato-sensory representations, one is tempted to state that focal dystonia fi-nally marks the natural limits of a process of refinement of manual dexterity over a million years. However, a hereditary component seems to play a role, since according to a presently conducted neurogenetical study in more than 15 % of our patients, (non- musician) members of the family are afflicted with other forms of focal dystonia...|$|E
