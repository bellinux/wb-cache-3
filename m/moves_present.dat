40|$|Information and Communications Technologies {{globally}} {{are moving}} towards Service Oriented Architectures and Web Services. The healthcare environment is rapidly {{moving to the}} use of Service Oriented Architecture/Web Services systems interconnected via this global open Internet. Such <b>moves</b> <b>present</b> major challenges where these structures are not based on highly trusted operating systems. This paper argues the need of a radical re-think of access control in the contemporary healthcare environment in light of modern information system structures, legislative and regulatory requirements, and security operation demands in Health Information Systems. This paper proposes the Open and Trusted Health Information Systems (OTHIS), a viable solution including override capability to the provision of appropriate levels of secure access control for the protection of sensitive health data...|$|E
40|$|The {{beginning}} of the 21 st century witnesses a trend for business and leisure travelers to make accommodation decisions by referring to online reviews of hotel accommodation services and the hotel management’s responses to such reviews. The responses, termed review response genre in this study, have since attracted considerable research attention. The {{purpose of this article}} is twofold. First, it aims to identify the <b>moves</b> <b>present</b> in the review response genre; second, it aims to explore how the hotel management attempts to achieve service recovery with the moves of the genre. A total of three obligatory moves are identified: Acknowledging Problem, Expressing Feeling and Thanking Reviewer. The findings will have significant implications for the hospitality and wider service industry practitioners responsible for handling negative online reviews. Department of Englis...|$|E
40|$|Letters to the Editor (LTEs) in {{the local}} press are a {{relatively}} formalised everyday genre in which readers 2 ̆ 7 opinions appear in a publication. In this article 20 Chilean and 20 Australian LTEs which contained the macro communicative intention of 2 ̆ 7 thanking 2 ̆ 7 were analysed and compared {{with regard to the}} structural moves and Politeness Strategies (PS) they presented. The results show that addressers in both cultures follow a highly schematic way of constructing their Letters of Gratitude. This is evident not only in the sharing of most of their obligatory moves but also in that some of these <b>moves</b> <b>present</b> similar lexico-syntactic compositions to establish their limits. With regard to PS, the Chilean group showed the exclusive presence of strategies that acknowledged the role of the editor as a letter mediator directly. This suggests that the similarities found are genre-defining aspects. Conversely, the differences are connected to the cultural context of publication. The results also suggest that expressing gratitude in the written form may functionally differ from the way it is expressed orally. This type of contrastive study helps to identify both the genre-and culture specific aspects of discourse, which deepen our understanding of cultural, everyday manifestations and their realization in different settings...|$|E
