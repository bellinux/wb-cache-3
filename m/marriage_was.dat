5|$|After the king's {{death on}} June 28, 572, Helmichis married Rosamund and claimed the Lombard throne in Verona. The <b>marriage</b> <b>was</b> {{important}} for Helmichis: it legitimized his rule because, judging from Lombard history, royal prerogatives could be inherited by marrying the king's widow; and the <b>marriage</b> <b>was</b> a guarantee for Helmichis of {{the loyalty of}} the Gepids in the army, who sided with the queen since she was Cunimund's daughter.|$|E

5|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century.

Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may be that Frankish support for him, acquired via the <b>marriage,</b> <b>was</b> instrumental in gaining the throne for him.|$|E
