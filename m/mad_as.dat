5|$|Angela and Serah {{then headed}} to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland {{as it was}} the {{whereabouts}} of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria, the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned somewhat different. Seeing the girl was not <b>mad</b> <b>as</b> Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela {{to keep an eye on}} her. As the days passed, Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends a sliver of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then told her she was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned her touch was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than what she was, and willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything was right. There she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and so she did, but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started to talk with her.|$|E

40|$|As the {{simplest}} communication media, mading {{is a significant}} medium to encourage creativity, imagination and provide opportunity for students to be expresive. In fact, there aren’t many schools utilizing <b>mading</b> <b>as</b> a communication medium to empower students. Mading management that empowers students will also provide benefits to improve the literacy skills and build a culture of teamwork. This paper aims to examine the utilization of <b>mading</b> <b>as</b> a learning medium for students at SDN Tanjung Anom 3 Nganjuk. Mading is merely informative medium or one-way communication from the teacher to the students. Mading utilization is emphasized as a bulletin board only. Community service activities were implemented then, aimed to put <b>mading</b> <b>as</b> a medium of participatory communication in order to foster synergies between school as educational institution {{and the needs of}} the students. The results of the training has been done in SDN Tanjung Anom 3 shows that the management of mading within involvement of students will make them become more creative, expressive and imaginative. Students further become collaborative and explorative in mading management thus the function of <b>mading</b> <b>as</b> a medium of two way communication might be implemented...|$|R

25|$|Hamlet {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Earl of Essex, who was executed for leading a rebellion against Queen Elizabeth. Essex's situation has been analyzed by scholars for its revelations into Elizabethan ideas of madness in connection with treason as they connect with Hamlet. Essex was largely seen as out of his mind by Elizabethans, and admitted to insanity on the scaffold before his death. Seen in the same context, Hamlet is quite possibly as <b>mad</b> <b>as</b> he is pretending to be, at least in an Elizabethan sense.|$|E
25|$|Chubbuck's suicide {{allegedly}} provided part of {{the inspiration}} for Paddy Chayefsky's script for the 1976 satirical film on the television industry, Network. In that film, laid-off news anchor Howard Beale (played by Peter Finch) announced plans to take {{his life on the}} air, before backing down on his request and starting a diatribe that would revitalize his career and the network. However, according to Dave Itzkoff's book <b>Mad</b> <b>as</b> Hell: The Making of Network and the Fateful Vision of the Angriest Man in Movies, Chayefsky actually began writing Network months before Chubbuck’s death and already planned for Howard Beale to vow to kill himself on air; Chubbuck's suicide was an eerie coincidence. Sidney Lumet, who directed the film, also confirmed that the character of Howard Beale was never based on any real life person.|$|E

[...] Critics disagreed on which songs were lacking, though. [...] "Losing My Mind" [...] and [...] "Young Man, Old Man" [...] were called [...] "highlights" [...] by Jane Stevenson of the Toronto Sun, though elsewhere the former was called [...] "woeful" [...] and the latter a [...] "'Freddie's Dead' vamp" [...] that should have been skipped.|$|E

The drums become louder during the third and final verse which leads into a bridge that begins after 1 minute and 31 seconds. During the bridge Rhys sings the lines [...] "Oh the monkey puzzle tree has some questions for the watchdogs of the profane, and I ask, is it sad that I'm driving myself <b>mad</b> <b>as</b> this fire in my heart turns blue". A key change to F♯ major follows for the final verse, with Rhys repeating the line [...] "I've got a fire in my heart for you" [...] backed by multiple harmony vocals.

500|$|Cleveland's {{next game}} {{was against the}} Yankees, who had {{the best record in}} the AAFC's eastern {{division}} and were a likely opponent in the championship game. New York took an early lead as Spec Sanders scored two rushing touchdowns in the first quarter and added a third in the second. Sanders, called [...] "Spectacular Spec" [...] by New York sportswriters, was having a career season. By the end of the year, he had compiled 1,432 rushing yards and 1,442 passing yards; his 18 touchdowns set a professional football record that was not surpassed until the 1960s. After Sanders' three touchdowns, New York's Buddy Young added a fourth in the second quarter, widening the Yankees' lead to 28–0. Cleveland's Bill Boedeker scored a touchdown on a pass from Graham at the end of the period, but the game appeared out of reach for Cleveland at the half. The Browns, however, came back in the second half. Motley rushed for two touchdowns in the third quarter and Jim Dewar ran for a score in the fourth. The game ended in a tie. At halftime, Yankees players had hurled insults at the Browns. [...] "They got us upset, got us angry," [...] Graham later said. [...] "Finally we got <b>mad</b> <b>as</b> a team and we said, 'We'll show these guys,' and we started playing football." [...] More than 70,000 fans came to watch the game, a record for a New York pro football game that stood until 1958. Attendance was boosted by the presence of about 25,000 black fans who came in part to watch the four black players in the game: Buddy Young of the Yankees and Motley, Bill Willis and Horace Gillom of the Browns. Groza was injured during the game and was not able to play.|$|E
500|$|... "A Change Is Gonna Come" [...] was {{the first}} episode not to feature Washington's character, Burke. Washington was officially fired from the series, {{following}} an on-set incident with Knight and Dempsey, which {{had been in the}} media attention since the commencement of the production for the third season. News reports surfaced that Washington had insulted co-star Knight with a homophobic slur. Following the exposure of the argument, Knight publicly disclosed his homosexuality, which led to Washington's issuing an apology statement, regarding his inappropriate use of words during the incident. The controversy later resurfaced when the cast appeared at the 65th Golden Globe Awards ceremony, which saw Washington ridiculing homosexuality during an interview, following the statement that denied the occurrence of an on-set incident. After being rebuked by his studio, Touchstone Television, Washington publicly apologized at length for using the epithet in reference to Knight. An issue of People disclosed Washington's presence at executive counseling, which led to an undetermined hiatus of his contract. After [...] "Didn't We Almost Have It All?", the last episode Washington appeared in, was filmed, the network decided not to give Washington the possibility of a renewal. In a statement released by his publicist, Washington assesed, [...] "I'm <b>mad</b> <b>as</b> hell and I'm {{not going to take it}} anymore". In another report, Washington stated he was planning to spend the summer pursuing charity work in Sierra Leone, while working on an independent film. In a subsequent interview, Washington highlighted the unfairness in his being let go from the series, considering filing a lawsuit as a result. He also accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on the series. Following his firing, Washington began asserting that racism within the broadcasting media was a primary factor in his dismissal from the series, which drew a critical perspective from Rhimes. During his appearance on Larry King Live, Washington once again denied using a homophobic epithet in reference to Knight.|$|E
500|$|After being rebuked by his studio, Touchstone Television, Washington {{issued a}} {{statement}} apologizing for repeating the word on the Golden Globes carpet. On January 30, 2007, a source told People magazine that Washington was scheduled {{to return to the}} Grey's Anatomy set as early on that Thursday {{for the first time since}} entering [...] "executive counseling" [...] after making the comments at the Golden Globes. However, on June 7, 2007, ABC announced it had decided not to renew Washington's contract, and that he would be dropped from the show. [...] "I'm <b>mad</b> <b>as</b> hell and I'm not going to take it anymore," [...] Washington said in a statement released by his publicist, borrowing the famous line from Network. In another report, Washington stated he was planning to [...] "spend the summer pursuing charity work in Sierra Leone, work on an independent film and avoid worrying about the show." [...] In a subsequent interview, Washington claimed that [...] "they fired the wrong guy", referring to Knight, and said he was considering filing a lawsuit as a result. He accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on Grey's Anatomy. Washington, in late June 2007, began asserting that racism within the media was a factor in his firing from the series. On July 2, 2007, Washington appeared on Larry King Live on CNN, to present his side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who, he felt, was treating him like a [...] "B-word," [...] a [...] "P-word," [...] and the [...] "F-word," [...] which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back." [...] Washington himself said that his dismissal from Grey's Anatomy was an unfortunate misunderstanding that he was eager to move past. He later stated that if he were to be asked to make a cameo appearance on the show, he would not hesitate to say [...] "yes". Washington's image was used in advertisements for the May 9, 2008 episode [...] "The Becoming". After this aired, Washington's attorney Peter Nelson contacted ABC and Screen Actors Guild and cited this as an unlawful use of his client's image. His publicist, Howard Bragman, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "they have the rights of the character to advance the story, but not the image" [...] and stated he expected this to result in a [...] "financial settlement", but it is still uncertain whether this ultimately happened.|$|E
