5000|$|Re-establishment of {{the park}} in 1950 coincided with a period of {{financial}} difficulty, followed by a building boom which saw more than 12,000 trees felled {{for the construction of}} houses, roads and ski tracks. A reorganisation {{of the park}} management {{at the end of the}} 1960s heralded better times and by 1976 further expansion, to 400 km², followed at the request of villages in neighbouring Molise, that were convinced by the economic benefits of the park. Today, at 500 km², the area of the park is 100 times larger than the original reserve. However the park's role in the marsican bear conservation program is now strongly debated; while every year there are <b>monitoring</b> <b>actions</b> of the total bear's population there have been recently some problems related to the pave actions carried out inside the park's boundaries and the building projects to connect the only ski track of the park to the opposite valley, which is a delicate spot for the bear's movements.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>monitoring</b> <b>actions</b> and oral speech, the Third Section also {{played an important}} role in censorship of printed works. Although the Ministry of Education created the censorship laws and did the busywork of searching for objectionable material, Ministry censors were instructed to inform the Third Section of authors who violated the regulations. However, rather than wait to surveil only authors who had violated the censorship regulations, Third Section agents preferred to surveil certain authors and then, once suspicious activity was spotted, reject that author’s material even if it had passed the censors. In 1832, the Third Section gained the ability to reject publishers or editors of new periodicals on moral grounds, effectively putting the section in control of new periodicals, which could only be established with the Tsar’s approval. In the early 1830s, the Section attempted to apply its mandate to be a moral guide to Russians by encouraging publications it deemed good for the Empire rather than just punishing the authors of damaging works. For example, when Mikhail Pogodin wrote an article supporting Russia’s historic right to Lithuania, the Third Section offered him a reward.|$|E

50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{powers and}} responsibilities of the CMSN, outlined in Article 3 of the charter, included establishing the general policies of the nation, promulgating ordinances to carry out policy, <b>monitoring</b> <b>actions</b> of the government, ratifying international agreements, and granting amnesty except in cases of retributory justice and religious crimes (see Law and Crime, ch. 5). Articles 4 through 10 pertained to the internal organization of the CMSN and presidential succession. Members were nominated to the CMSN by ordinance of that body, and it alone decided the procedures by which it would conduct its business. Included within the CMSN was the Permanent Committee, consisting of all CMSN members posted to Nouakchott. The Permanent Committee met in ordinary session once every fifteen days and in extraordinary session when convoked by the president. The CMSN was required to meet in ordinary session every third month and in extraordinary session when convoked by the president after approval of the Permanent Committee, or upon the request of one-third of the members. If the president were temporarily absent, {{the president of the}} CMSN would nominate a member of the Permanent Committee to carry out the routine affairs of state. If the president were temporarily incapacitated, the Permanent Committee would nominate one of its members to manage affairs of state for a period not to exceed one month. In the event of the president's death or a long-term incapacitation, the Permanent Committee would designate one of its members to carry out the functions of president for one week, after which the entire CMSN would appoint a new president from among its members.|$|E

40|$|Behavioural {{modelling}} {{has been}} widely used {{to aid in the}} design of concurrent systems. Behaviour models have shown to be useful to uncover design errors in early stages of the development process. However, building correct behaviour models is costly and requires significant experience. Controller synthesis offers a way to build models that are correct by construction. Existing software engineering techniques for synthesising controllers have various limitations. Such limitations can be seen as restrictions in the expressiveness of the controller goals and environment model, or in the relation between the controllable and <b>monitored</b> <b>actions.</b> The main aim of this thesis is the development of novel techniques overcoming known limitations of previous approaches and methodological guidelines for synthesising useful controllers. This thesis establishes the framework for controller synthesis techniques that support event-based models, expressive goal specifications, distinguish controllable from <b>monitored</b> <b>actions</b> and guarantee achievement of the desired goals. Together with these techniques, methodological guidelines are proposed to help in building more accurate descriptions of the environment and more effective controllers. In addition, this thesis presents a tool that implements the proposed techniques. Evaluation of the techniques has been conducted using the tool to model known case studies from the literature, showing that by allowing more expressive controller goals and environment models, and explicitly distinguishing controllable and <b>monitored</b> <b>actions</b> such case studies can be more accurately modelled and solutions guaranteeing satisfaction of the goals can be achieved.

40|$|To improve behavior, {{one must}} detect errors and {{initiate}} subsequent corrective adaptations. This <b>action</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{process has been}} widely studied, but {{little is known about}} how one may improve this aspect of cognition. To examine the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and <b>action</b> <b>monitoring,</b> we recorded the error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related brain potential believed to index <b>action</b> <b>monitoring,</b> as well as post-error behavioral indices of <b>action</b> <b>monitoring</b> from healthy young adults (18 – 25 years) who varied in cardiorespiratory fitness. These measures were collected during the execution of flanker tasks emphasizing response accuracy or speed to better assess the specificity of any potential relationships between fitness and <b>action</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Higher fitness was associated with greater post-error accuracy and ERN amplitude during task conditions emphasizing accuracy, as well as greater modulation of these indices across task instruction conditions. These findings suggest that higher fitness is associated with increased cognitive flexibility, evidenced through greater change in <b>action</b> <b>monitoring</b> indices as a function of task parameters. Thus, fitness may benefit <b>action</b> <b>monitoring</b> by selectively increasing cognitive control under conditions where error detection and performance adjustments are more salient.

40|$|Abstract. UML {{sequence}} diagrams {{are widely}} used during requirements analysis and design for specifying the expected behaviors of a system. In this paper, we present a monitoring profile that extends sequence diagrams to facilitate the comparison between the actual behaviors and expected behaviors of a system. With the profile, the developers can precisely specify the runtime objects to be monitored, the expected sequences of message exchanges among these objects, and the <b>monitoring</b> <b>actions</b> to be performed when the message exchanges are observed. Supported by the tools that we develop, the <b>monitoring</b> <b>actions</b> can inspect program states, verify assertions, record coverage information, and visualize the computation during the progress of various scenarios. These tools allow software developers to effectively use their design knowledge to detect and localize bugs during testing and debugging. ...|$|E
