50|$|Before the Tenures Abolition Act of 1660, which {{effectively}} {{introduced the}} concept of freehold into English law, the Lord of the Honour was Lord Paramount over all the <b>mesne</b> <b>lords</b> of the Honour. He exercised governance of the Honour through manorial and forest courts.|$|R
50|$|It is {{recorded}} {{that before the}} Conquest a second manor at Ickford was held by Ulf, a man of Harold Godwinson. The Domesday Book records Robert, Count of Mortain as holding this second manor, with the Benedictine Grestain Abbey as his <b>mesne</b> <b>lord.</b> By 1359 Wilmington Priory in Sussex, an English cell of the abbey, was the <b>mesne</b> <b>lord.</b> By 1377 William de Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury, who had succeeded {{to some of the}} de Mortain lands, was Ickford's overlord.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>mesne</b> <b>lord</b> is a {{landlord}} who has tenants holding under him, while himself holding of a superior lord. Similar ideas are subinfeudation and subcontract.|$|E
50|$|Walter Giffard's <b>mesne</b> <b>lord</b> was Hugh de Bolebec, whose heirs {{were the}} Earls of Oxford. The mesne lordshire of Addingrove {{followed}} that of Whitchurch until 1635.|$|E
50|$|The tenants were termed <b>mesne</b> <b>lords,</b> {{with regard}} to those holding from them, the {{immediate}} tenant being tenant in capite. The lowest tenant {{of all was the}} freeholder, or, as he was sometimes termed tenant paravail. The Crown, who in theory owned all lands, was lord paramount.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>mesne</b> <b>lords</b> {{continued}} to exist after the abolition of any further subinfeudation by the statute of Quia Emptores, with time {{and the loss of}} records (except in the case of former copyhold land), it came to be assumed that most land was held directly of the crown.|$|R
50|$|The statute {{provided}} that subtenants {{could not be}} allowed to alienate land to other persons while retaining the nominal possession and feudal rights over it. The seller had to relinquish all rights and duties to the new buyer, and retained nothing. This was the end of subinfeudation. The middle <b>lords</b> or <b>mesne</b> <b>lords</b> (who could be common persons) and had granted land for service to those lower on the social scale could no longer come into existence. After Quia Emptores, every existing seignory must have been created prior to the enactment of the statute. The old feudal sequence was: the King granted land to a great lord, who then granted to lesser lords or commoners, who in turn repeated the process, becoming lesser <b>lords</b> (<b>mesne</b> <b>lords)</b> themselves. This was subinfeudation. The effect was to make the transfer of land a completely commercial transaction, and not one of feudalism. There were no provisions placed upon the Crown.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>mesne</b> <b>lord</b> was a lord in the {{feudal system}} who had vassals who held land from him, {{but who was}} himself the vassal of a higher lord. A <b>mesne</b> <b>lord</b> did not hold land {{directly}} of the king, {{that is to say}} he was not a tenant-in-chief. His subinfeudated estate was called a [...] "mesne estate" [...] or Afterlehen in the Holy Roman Empire. He was thus an intermediate or [...] "middle" [...] tenant, which status is reflected in the medieval French word mesne, in modern French moyen.|$|E
50|$|Richard de Bradwall (living before 1232 in {{the time}} of King John) was the first of two {{families}} to settle in the manor of Bradwall, becoming the <b>mesne</b> <b>lord</b> of a moiety of the manor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} land tenure has been {{described}} as a [...] "spatial fragmentation of proprietary interests in land". No one person could claim absolute ownership of a parcel of land, except the Crown. Thus the modern concept of [...] "ownership" [...] is not helpful in explaining the complexity of the distribution of rights. In relation to a particular piece of land, a number of people had rights: first, the tenant in demesne with possessory rights; second the <b>mesne</b> <b>lord</b> to whom the tenant owed services; third, a tenant in chief to whom the <b>mesne</b> <b>lord</b> owed services; and finally the Crown who received services directly from the tenant in chief.|$|E
25|$|The heerlijkheden {{came into}} being {{as a result of}} the feudal system, in {{particular}} the sovereign's delegated judicial prerogative. The crown, as lord paramount, granted the right to govern and to exercise judicial authority to a crown vassal, often a confidante or as a reward for military service or political support. The crown vassal—e.g. a count (graaf) or duke (hertog)—thus exercised all or part of the sovereign's royal authority. In turn the crown vassal granted rights to the <b>mesne</b> <b>lords</b> of the heerlijkheden.|$|R
50|$|Most {{of these}} tenants-in-chief had {{considerable}} land holdings {{and proceeded to}} grant parts of their land to their subordinates. This constant process of granting new tenures was known as subinfeudation. It created a complicated pyramid of feudal relationships. (see also Lord of the manor). At {{the bottom of the}} feudal pyramid were the tenants who lived on and worked the land (called the tenants in demesne and also the tenant paravail). In the middle were the lords who had no direct relationship with the King, or with the land in question - referred to as <b>mesne</b> <b>lords.</b>|$|R
50|$|Its <b>mesne</b> <b>lords</b> (intermediate landlords) {{included}} George Rotherham (21 years), Sir Henry Hobart (99 years) for Anthony Chester (assumed title {{three years}} later), Dr. Peter Barwick, Roger Gillingham, John Borrett {{and finally the}} 1764 will of John Briscoe bequeathing Shillington Bury to Henry Earl of Essex for life, remainder to {{the daughters of the}} late chivalric Bath King of Arms, Grey Longueville. As such, it settled in 1800 on Grey Arnold and cousin Bridget Frances Anne. Little is known of the mid-19th century except for a sale by a Miss Profit to the father of William Hanscombe, the 1908 lord of the manor.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} estate {{granted to}} Anchetil de Greye in England was Redrefield (subsequently Rotherfield Greys) and its manor house, Greys Court now in South Oxfordshire. Anchetil {{was also the}} <b>mesne</b> <b>lord</b> of Standlake now in West Oxfordshire.|$|E
50|$|A liberty was an English unit {{originating}} in the Middle Ages, traditionally defined as {{an area in which}} regalian right was revoked and where the land was held by a <b>mesne</b> <b>lord</b> (i.e., an area in which rights reserved to the king had been devolved into private hands). It later became a unit of local government administration.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of commuting for money {{the obligation of}} military service struck {{at the root of}} the whole system, and so complete was the change of conception that tenure by knightservice of a <b>mesne</b> <b>lord</b> becomes, first in fact and then in law, tenure by escuage (i.e. scutage). By the time of Henry III, as Bracton states, the test of tenure was scutage; liability, however small, to scutage payment made the tenure military.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} a {{landlord}} may {{be traced back to}} the feudal system of manoralism (seignorialism), where a landed estate is owned by a Lord of the Manor (<b>mesne</b> <b>lords),</b> usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of knights in the high medieval period, holding their fief via subinfeudation, but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the royal domain directly owned by a king, or in the Holy Roman Empire imperial villages directly subject to the emperor.The medieval system ultimately continues the system of villas and latifundia of the Roman Empire.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of a money economy in the 19th century and modernization programs in the mid-20th century, the economy of Bhutan was based entirely on payment in kind and in labour, including unfree labour. In the feudal land tenure system, in which all land was held by the sovereign and populated by tenants, serfdom and service to <b>mesne</b> <b>lords</b> was commonplace. Ordinary citizens, for their part, were bound by the driglam namzha to do work such as dzong construction as part of their tax obligation to the state. The gradual transition to a feudal money economy was prompted by Bhutanese military and territorial losses to the British, which resulted in annual cash subsidies to the Bhutanese government. These money revenues eventually replaced unfree labour as the backbone of the Bhutanese economy.|$|R
50|$|In the 11th {{century in}} the reign of Edward the Confessor Wenesi, the king's chamberlain, held a manor of five hides at Turweston. After the Norman conquest of England he was dispossessed and the Domesday Book records that Turweston was held by a Norman, William de Fougères. By 1278 the overlordship had passed to Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Mortimer, and it descended with his heirs the Earls of March until the 15th century. The Mortimers' <b>mesne</b> <b>lords</b> of Turweston were the Barons Zouche. The lesser lords of Turweston were the Scovill family until the 1280s, when the estate was escheated to the Crown. In 1292 Edward I {{bestowed}} the manor on Westminster Abbey. The Abbey retained Turweston after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s, and still held the manor in the 1920s.|$|R

Grants from the Crown “in free, pure and perpetual alms” would be free from all secular service. However, if a <b>mesne</b> <b>lord</b> was involved, then services such as socage, fee and other services might be extracted from the land, either in part or in total.|$|E
50|$|In the Anglo-Norman shires and liberties, the cantred was {{originally}} {{a unit of}} subinfeudation; a magnate or tenant-in-chief who received {{a grant from the}} King of England as Lord of Ireland would typically grant a cantred or half-cantred to a baron as <b>mesne</b> <b>lord,</b> who would hold the chief manor and grant sub-manors to his tenants. Church land within a cantred was excluded from grants. Unlike a knight's fee, there was no military service in the feudal duties of a cantred.|$|E
50|$|Two oxgangs {{of land in}} Walton {{belonged to}} King Edward the Confessor in 1066, and after the Norman conquest, was the demesne of Roger de Busli and Albert Grelley. The manor passed in about 1130 to Henry de Lacy of Pontefract and was later granted to the Banastres and their successors the Langtons. John de Langton {{obtained}} the right to hold a weekly market and an annual fair in October in 1301.The manor passed from the Langtons to the Hoghtons of Hoghton who held the manor as <b>mesne</b> <b>lord.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Levedale, {{which also}} had the de Staffords as overlords. At Domesday the tenants were Brien and Drew and, for centuries after, the <b>mesne</b> <b>lords,</b> or {{intermediate}} tenants were descendants of Brien, the de Standon family. In the mid-12th century, the terre tenant, the actual resident lord of the manor, was Engenulf de Gresley, who had no sons but divided the manor among his three daughters. This unleashed a series of family disputes, legal wrangles and displays of petty greed that went on for centuries. For example, around 1272, Amice, widow of Henery of Verdun, a deceased lord of Levedale, abducted her own son from {{the custody of the}} overlord, Robert de Standon. Robert took Amice to court, where she was forced to admit to the facts of the case, and was ordered to return young Henry to Robert.|$|R
50|$|The manor first left {{complete}} royal demesne, {{with the}} unfettered right to appoint <b>mesne</b> <b>lords,</b> in 1173 when the King granted the estate worth £15 {{per year to}} Roger de Sanford who three years later owed 5 marks for default (of the annual knight's fee) to the King. His executors negotiated a notified Release of it to William de Buckland who paid £100 to effectively be seized of the whole village, save the churchlands; in 1216 his son-in-law, Robert de Ferrar, inherited. His son-in-law was to receive it by a family settlement yet unfortunately this man named William d'Avrenches died before 1230 and his son before 1235, thus the lands descended to Hamon de Crevecœur via a daughter, followed by his son William and his widow Mabel who later married John Tregoz (before her death in 1297).|$|R
50|$|The estates of the Benedictine Pershore Abbey {{included}} lands at Beoleahe from {{at least}} the 10th century when Edgar the Peaceful restored them to the monks in AD 972. The Domesday Book of 1086 records that the abbey held 21 hides of land at Beolege and Yardley. The de Beauchamp family of Elmley Castle, ancestors of William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick, were <b>mesne</b> <b>lords</b> of the manor from the 12th century until about 1265, when they acquired the overlordship (superiority) from the abbey. In the 13th century the toponym was variously rendered Boleye, Beleg or Buley. The superiority of Beoley descended with the de Beauchamps until the death of Henry de Beauchamp, 1st Duke of Warwick in 1446, when it passed to his daughter Elizabeth, wife of George Nevill, 1st Baron Latimer. This superiority {{is said to have}} remained with the Latimers until John Nevill, 4th Baron Latimer sold it in 1549.|$|R
5000|$|In the Domesday Book of 1086 {{the twin}} {{holdings}} of Loxhore {{were two of}} at least four manors held in Devon by the Norman magnate Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester, Count of Meulan (c. 1040/50-1118) as a <b>mesne</b> <b>lord</b> from Baldwin de Meulles. [...] William the Conqueror had granted Robert about 91 English manors in several counties as recompense for his service in the Norman conquest of England. Loxhore, along with Ashford (east of Heanton Punchardon) and Shirwell, stayed for many generations within the Beaumont family.|$|E
50|$|By 1235 Wadard's other manor at Cassington {{was part}} of the honour of Saint Valery, which by 1300 belonged to Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall. However, by 1414 it {{was part of}} the Honour of Wallingford. By the end of the 12th century the mesne lordship of the manor had been divided and after 1247 the <b>mesne</b> <b>lord</b> of one part granted it to Godstow Abbey. The lordship of the other part changed hands down the centuries. In 1661 it was bought by Henry Allnut, and in 1711 his son (also Henry) sold it to John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough.|$|E
50|$|In 1086 FitzOsbern's <b>mesne</b> <b>lord</b> was Anchetil de Greye, {{who also}} held Rotherfield Greys in South Oxfordshire. The mesne lordship {{remained}} with the de Greyes until 1192, when John de Greye died without a male heir and his holding Standlake passed {{to his daughter}} Eve. Eve's husband Ralph Murdac {{took part in a}} rebellion for which he was deprived of his landholdings in 1194, but after Ralph's death Richard I restored Standlake to Eve. When Eve died in 1242 the tenure of the manor was divided into quarters, which were not reunited until the 16th century.|$|E
5000|$|Dominus is the Latin {{word for}} master or owner. As a title of {{sovereignty}} the term under the Roman Republic {{had all the}} associations of the Greek Tyrannos; refused during the early principate, it finally became an official title of the Roman Emperors under Diocletian (this is where the term dominate, used to describe a political system of Roman Empire in 284-476, is derived from). Dominus, the French equivalent being [...] "sieur", was the Latin title of the feudal, superior and <b>mesne,</b> <b>lords,</b> and also an ecclesiastical and academical title. The ecclesiastical title was rendered in English [...] "sir", which was a common prefix before the Reformation for parsons, as in Sir Hugh Evans in Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor. In the past, the academical use was for a Bachelor of Arts. The shortened form [...] "Dom" [...] {{is used as a}} prefix of honor for ecclesiastics of the Catholic Church, and especially for members of the benedictine and other religious orders.|$|R
50|$|The {{same system}} was adopted in Ireland when that country was conquered under Henry II. The magnate {{who had been}} enfeoffed by his {{sovereign}} for his honour of land could provide the knights required either by hiring them for pay or, more conveniently when wealth was mainly represented by land, by a process of subinfeudation, analogous to that by which he himself had been enfeoffed. That is to say, he could assign to an under-tenant a certain portion of his fief to be held by direct military service or the service of providing a mercenary knight. The land so held would then be described as consisting {{of one or more}} knight's fees, but the knight's-fee had not any fixed area, as different soils and climates required differing acreages to produce a given profit requisite to support a knight and his entourage. This process could be carried farther till there was a chain of <b>mesne</b> <b>lords</b> between the tenant-in-chief and the actual occupier of the land. The liability for performance of the knight-service was however always carefully defined.|$|R
5000|$|The germ of {{the later}} {{distinction}} between [...] "grand" [...] (French: grand, [...] "large") and [...] "petty" [...] (French petit, [...] "small") serjeanty {{is found in the}} Magna Carta of 1215, the king there renouncing the right of prerogative wardship in the case of those who held of him by the render of small articles. The legal doctrine which developed that serjeanties were inalienable (i.e. non-transferrable) and impartible, led during the reign of King Henry III (1216-1272) to the arrentation of those serjeanties the lands of which had been partly alienated, which were thereby converted into socage tenures (i.e. paying money rents), or in some cases, tenures by knight-service. Gradually the gulf widened, and [...] "petty" [...] serjeanties, consisting of renders, together with serjeanties held of <b>mesne</b> <b>lords,</b> sank into socage, while [...] "grand" [...] serjeanties, the holders of which performed their service in person, became alone liable to the burden of wardship and marriage. In Littleton's Tenures (15th century), this distinction appears as well defined, but the development was one of legal theory.|$|R
