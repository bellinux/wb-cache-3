40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{the need for}} a coherent conceptual framework for <b>information</b> <b>management.</b> The paper discusses the field of <b>information</b> <b>management</b> as represented by existing analyses of author affiliations, and a distinction is introduced between <b>information</b> <b>management</b> at institutional level and <b>information</b> <b>management</b> at conceptual level. Conceptual frameworks should be founded on concepts. One of the challenges of developing a framework is to delimit the area of inquiry. Is <b>information</b> <b>management</b> a discipline in its own right, or is <b>information</b> <b>management</b> several disciplines? Little research has examined <b>information</b> <b>management</b> in a disciplinary perspective. It is argued that an exploration of the components of a discipline is important as a foundation for development of a conceptual framework for <b>information</b> <b>management.</b> The paper concludes by suggesting that <b>information</b> <b>management</b> has three different underlying concepts: <b>Information</b> <b>Management</b> 1 : <b>information</b> <b>management</b> at institutional level. <b>Information</b> <b>Management</b> 2 : content-oriented <b>information</b> <b>management,</b> rooted in <b>information</b> science and <b>Information</b> <b>Management</b> 3 : technology-oriented <b>information</b> <b>management,</b> rooted in <b>information</b> systems. A coherent conceptual framework that incorporates disciplinary perspectives may provide a new theoretical understanding that helps us conceptualize the identity of <b>information</b> <b>management...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Information</b> <b>Management</b> is {{the process}} of {{information}} identification, production, classification, storage, dissemination and utilization considering the organizational, cultural, social as well as technological components. Given this, <b>information</b> <b>management</b> would require teamwork and well-defined task description for each and every individual. In order to fulfill their special tasks to secure the four pillars of <b>information</b> <b>management</b> (Production, Organization, Storage and Dissemination and finally application) Information managers are at the mercy of crucial factors such as technology, organization and social-cultural makeup of corporations. The present paper explores the concept of <b>information</b> <b>management</b> and would delve further into strategic <b>information</b> <b>management,</b> personal <b>information</b> <b>management,</b> interpersonal <b>information</b> <b>management</b> as well as effective <b>information</b> <b>management.</b> In the conclusion it would make a case from the standpoint of information ecology...|$|R

5|$|Management in all {{business}} and organizational activities is {{the act of}} getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives efficiently and effectively. Management comprises planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization (a group {{of one or more}} people or entities), or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal. Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources, and natural resources. Towards the end of the 20th century, business management came to consist of six separate branches, namely human resource management, operations management (or production management), strategic management, marketing management, financial management, and information technology management, which was responsible for <b>management</b> <b>information</b> systems. Although it is difficult to subdivide management into functional categories in this way, it helps in navigating the discipline of management. Design management overlaps mainly with the branches marketing management, operations management, and strategic management.|$|E
