The results indicate two unusual effects: (1) a large negative contribution {{due to the}} destruction of orientational order in a pure n-alkane component, and (2) a positive contribution attributed to the "condensation" of a more freely-moving molecule or segment on a sterically-hindered branched alkane, resulting in a restriction of rotational movement, i. e. creation of order in the solution. Mixtures of cycloalkanes and their methyl derivatives also show unexpected positive effects in the excess heat capacity. Thus the plate-like cyclopentane molecule gives positive C(,p) ('E) values when mixed with other plate-like <b>methyl</b> derivatives of <b>cyclohexane</b> suggesting a hindering of its molecular rotation.

Characterisation of the macromonomers was performed using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (nmr). Novel comb graft copolymers were synthesised by the copolymerisation of the macromonomer with a comonomer. The following comonomers were used: Z-vinylpyridine (Z-VP), 4 - vinylpyridine (4 -VP) and N-(vinylbenzyl) pyrrolidone (VBP). Graft copolymers were made {{with a range of}} compositions by varying the feed ratios of the comonomer to the macromonomer. Reactivity ratios were determined for the different graft copolymer systems and compared to the simple statistical copolymerisation of styrene with comonomer. Characterisation of the graft copolymers was performed using GPC, nmr and membrane osmometry. Micellar dispersions of the comb graft copolymers were prepared in cyclohexane, toluene and methanol. These were subsequently characterised by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Micellar behaviour was related to graft copolymer composition and structure.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{interesting}} {{problems associated with}} the thermal oxidation of hydrocarbons. The relationship between rate and structure is remarkable, the temperature dependence is anomalous and the kinetics are both complex and not fully understood. There is often a long induction period associated with the development of branching chains, during which time intermediates, such as peroxides and aldehydes, are built up in small quantity. The reaction is also very much subject to the influence of small homogeneous and heterogeneous additions. This means that not only can ignition be promoted, but by suitable means delayed or prevented, a subject of very great practical importance. The objective of the work here described has been to investigate the gas phase oxidation of a series of cycloparaffins and to compare the kinetics with similar open chain systems. Particular reference has been made to the problems of the rate-structure relationship and the effect of surfaces, both on the induction period and on the rate. The systems studied for this purpose have been a aeries of cycloparaffins from cyclopropane to cyolooctane, excluding cyclobutane but including various methyl substituted cyclopentanes and hexanes. The more detailed study of the kinetics and of the relevant inhibition phenomena been restricted to cyclopentane, n-pentane being used to provide comparison with the open chain paraffins. The work was carried out to a conventional static apparatus at pressures from 100 to 700 mm Hg, reaction vessels being of pyrox or silica. The course of the reaction was followed by pressure increase, measured on a mercury manometer. Product analysis by mass spectrometer, gas chromatography and chemical methods showed that pressure changes were a good measure of the extent of the reaction. Oxidation reactions in the gas phase have an anomalous temperature dependence resulting in "high" and "low" temperature regions of of reaction. Most of the present investigation has been carried out in the low temperature range, below 500 °C, with a little comparative work done at higher temperatures. It was first considered desirable to make some comparison of n-pentane and cyclopentane, since the oxidation of the normal paraffins has already been investigated, and the comparison would show how far results could be regarded as general. These experiments were carried out at 230 °C, with variation of both the hydrocarbon and oxygen pressures. In general the kinetics of the two paraffins are very similar. The reciprocal induction period was in all cases linearly proportional to the pressure of hydrocarbon or oxygen, the dependence being a little steeper with increasing hydrocarbon pressure than oxygen pressure. The dependence upon reactant pressure of the rate was found to be more complex. There is a limiting pressure of either hydrocarbon or oxygen above which increase in the pressure of the other reactant causes a rapid rise in rate to explosion. Below this critical pressure the rate attains a limiting value with increase either in oxygen or in hydrocarbon. Thus under certain conditions the rate becomes independant of the concentration of one reactant. The change from one type of behaviour to the other is gradual, and there is a region where the rate is linearly proportional to the concentration of one reactant over a wide pressure range. This type of behaviour was observed with several hydrocarbons. It had been previously supposed that with n-pentane the rate attained a limiting value with increase of oxygen, but it now appears that this is not always so. The comparison of a series of cycloparaffins was made at 250 Â°C (except cyclopropane which was investigated at a higher temperature). The rate increases with the size of the ring, {{in the same way as}} it does in the open chain paraffins with length of the chain. The only anomaly observed was with cyclooctane, which oxidised at a rate between cyclopentane and <b>cyclohexane.</b> <b>Methyl</b> groups on the ring, as in branched open chain paraffins, progressively lower the rate. The effect of increasing the surface to volume ratio of the reaction vessel, was investigated. Fourfold and sixfold increases lengthened the induction period by a small amount and decreased the rate, besides raising the limiting pressures mentioned above. Much higher pressures ware attained before the rate accelerated to explosion, and in some cases a limiting rate replaced an explosion. The result of various small homogeneous additions was next investigated. Peroxides, aldehydes and some halogens all shorten the induction period and in most cases increase the rate. This is thought to be due to the rapid production of radicals which initiate the main reaction. Isopropyl halides had little or no affect on the induction period or rate, aniline, carbon tetrachloride and carbon tetrafluoride had none. Inert gases in the form of nitrogen and carbon dioxide had no effect, even in large amounts. Experimental evidence suggests that the initiation reaction may take place largely on the surface of the containing vessel. In order to try and utilise this fact for the suppression of the reaction, various surface treatments were investigated. These consisted in coating the inside of the reaction vessel with a thick layer of various salts, deposited from an aqueous solution. Those used were a series of alkali halides and some salts of di- and tri- valent metals. In the first instance experiments on the length of the induction period were carried out between 250 °C and 290 °C. All the salts caused a increase in the induction period (θ) and Arrhenius plots of log 1 /θ against 1 /T abs. gave straight lines. The magnitude of this effect was large, induction periods being increased by up to a thousandfold. Some investigations were made on the rate of reaction at 250 °C and on account of the length of the induction period at this temperature, a trace of ditertiary butylperoxide was used as an initiator. Only a few of the less efficient salts gave a measurable rate, which was from 10 % to 50 % of the normal value. The others gave no measurable pressure increase, even with large amounts of initiator. It was further discovered that in the case of at least two salts, a few grams of the loose salt in a clean pyrex vessel had the same inhibiting effect as coating the whole interior of the vessel. This type of inhibition is not confined to salts, since silver wire, platinum wire and gold foil also inhibit the reaction. The temperature coefficient of the reaction was next investigated with cyclopentane in both salt-coated and uncoated vessels, and is anomalous. Two sections of smooth reaction are separated by a temperature region of cool flames and explosion. On raising the temperature the rate first increases and then gives way to explosion: this is succeeded by cool flames which as the high temperature region is approached give way to a smooth reaction with a negative temperature dependence. Eventually this becomes positive again and the rate finally rises to explosion. The whole process occurs over a temperature rang* of about 250 °C. The induction periods show no anomalous behaviour, and give one Arrhenius plot through both high and low temperature with no break in the cool flame portion. Similar experiments were carried out with salt-coated vessels. With lithium bromide the rate in the high temperature region was little affected, but at lower temperatures where cool flames might be expected, a very marked reduction in rate was noticed. Magnesium sulphate caused a large reduction in rate in the high temperature region. The principal reaction products were carbon monoxide and water with some carbon dioxide, others being in very low concentrations, Other products and intermediates detected were formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, n-butyric aldehyde, butene and an unidentified peroxide or peroxides. The concentration of the principal products followed the rate of pressure rise closely. The peroxide concentration (determined by an iodometric method) passed through a well defined maximum at the time of maximum rate. In the cool flame and explosion region the peroxide concentration rose with the pressure increase and immediately after the explosion fell back to a lower value. In salt-coated vessels the peroxide concentration was most markedly reduced, both at low and high temperatures. The interpretation of these results will now be considered. The kinetics of the cycloparaffins seem to be analogous to those of the n-paraffin series. The reactants can apparently both start and end chains, since under certain conditions the rate can become independent of the concentration of one reactant, and even be depressed with increasing oxygen pressure. The general shape of the rate/pressure curves can be given by a simple empirical expression of the form:- [For the equation omitted here, please consult the PDF. ] It is suggested that the progressive change in mode of reaction from low to high temperature occurs thorough the increased rate of of RO 2 radicals thus :- Low High RH + O 2 → R + HO 2 RH + O 2 → R + HO 2 R + O 2 → RO 2 R + O 2 → RO 2 RO 2 + RH → ROOH + R RO 2 → aldehydes → products ROOH → branching → products The cool flames are probably formed by the decomposition of the peroxide. The peroxide found experimentally at high temperatures is possibly hydrogen peroxide and not an organic peroxide. The peroxide postulated at low temperature may well be a cyclic one and the cyclic peroxy radicals of the high temperature mechanism would split to give one free radical and probably an aldehyde. The fact that the ring has to be broken means that there is a fundamental difference from the n-paraffins at some stage, although the resulting kinetics seem to be the same. The anomalous form of the temperature coefficient is typical of the oxidation of higher hydrocarbons and shows that two separate mechanisms oust exist, one showing a decrease in rate as the temperature is increased over a certain range. The structural effects in the cycloparaffins are again very similar to those in the n-paraffin series, methyl groups strongly decreasing the rate. This is probably due, either to the stabilising influence they have on a peroxide intermediate, or to the production of some more stable intermediate from the easily attacked tertiary carbon atoms. Increase in the surface/volume ratio of the reaction vessel indicates that chain ending on the walls can control the reaction to a large extent. The addition of almost any material which can produce free radicals under the conditions of the experiment, (e. g. aldehyde or peroxide) reduces the length of the induction period and in large amounts raises the rate. Evidently there are many free radicals capable of initiating the chain and if these are produced over a period of time, as in the oxidation of an added aldehyde, their concentration can become large enough to upset the kinetic balance of the reaction and so raise the total rate. The effect of a salt coating on the reaction vessel walls is of great interest. It seems very unlikely that the initiation reaction is interfered with in any my, since both metal wires and loose salt are as efficient as a complete coating. The inhibition must occur through the destruction of an intermediate, possibly a peroxide, since this has a half life time longer than that of the transient free radicals. Salt and metal surfaces might, however, destroy assail radicals of the type HO 2. Peroxide removal would explain the fact that the efficiency falls off as the temperature is raised towards the high temperature region. The analytical results having shorn that the rate of pressure change is a good measure of the extent of reaction and that the concentration of intermediates is always very small, the cycloparaffin ring must break to give radicals or fragments that are very rapidly converted to final products. From the point of view of the control or prevention of ignition the most significant results may be summarised as follows. Rapid reaction depends upon the slow build up of active intermediates. These are susceptible, in principle, to destruction both by homogeneous additions and by surface action. Homogeneous additions of an effective kind have proved difficult to find. On the other hand a considerable variety of surfaces exert a most marked effect in prolonging the induction period, in some cases almost indefinitely. The action is not improbably connected with the destruction of the intermediate peroxides. The chains by which reaction is propagated almost certainly are initiated on the vessel walls but prevention of this initiation does not seem to be the method of action of the inhibitors. Therefore the control of ignition by salts would be expected to be most effective when the salt is widely distributed thorough the gas. These considerations perhaps indicate the best lines of future work. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Effects of {{chemical}} structure {{changes on the}} thermal, mechanical, and crystalline properties of rigid rod epoxy resins have been studied for azomethine epoxy, biphenol epoxy, and tetramethyl biphenol epoxy. Rigid rod epoxies have exhibited better properties {{than those of the}} flexible bisphenol A epoxy. The chemical structures of both rigid rod epoxy and curing agent control the properties of cured rigid rod epoxies. When a flexible curing agent (<b>methyl</b> <b>cyclohexane</b> 1, 2 -dicarboxylic anhydride) was used, the chemical structure of rigid rod epoxy has dominated effects on the properties. Thus, the azomethine epoxy has shown the best thermal and mechanical properties among three rigid rod epoxies. While a rigid curing agent (sulfanilamide) was used, the physical properties of cured epoxies are not only dependent on the chemical structures of epoxies but also on the ease of formation of ordered network. Among the cured rigid rod epoxies, only the biphenol epoxy cured by sulfanilamide exhibits a liquid crystalline network. It has the highest glass transition temperature (219 °C) and the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion (20. 8 mm/m°C).

The results showed that (i) the adsorption amounts of C 10 H 22, C 7 H 14 and C 7 H 8 ranged from 0. 45 – 1. 03 mg/m 2, 0. 28 – 0. 90 mg/m 2 and 0. 16 – 0. 53 mg/m 2, respectively; (ii) for cookeite, ripidolite and kaolinite, the adsorption capacity of C 10 H 22 was less than C 7 H 14, which was less than C 7 H 8; (iii) for illite, Na-montmorillonite and Ca-montmorillonite, the adsorption capacity of C 10 H 22 was {{greater than that of}} C 7 H 8, and the adsorption capacity of C 7 H 14 was the lowest; (iv) for an illite/smectite mixed-layer, C 7 H 14 had the highest adsorption capacity, followed by C 10 H 22, and C 7 H 8 had the lowest capacity. Adsorption properties were correlated with the microscopic parameters of pores in clay minerals and with experimental pressure. Finally, the weighted average method was applied to evaluate the adsorption properties of C 10 H 22, C 7 H 14 and C 7 H 8 on clay minerals in oil-bearing shale from the Shahejie Formation of Dongying Sag in the Bohai Bay Basin, China. For these samples, the adsorbed amounts of C 7 H 14 ranged from 18. 03 – 28. 02 mg/g (mean 23. 33 mg/g), which is larger than that of C 10 H 22, which ranges from 15. 40 – 21. 72 mg/g (mean 18. 82 mg/g). The adsorption capacity of C 7 H 8 was slightly low, ranging from 10. 51 – 14. 60 mg/g (mean 12. 78 mg/g) ...|$|E
40|$|The Consortium for Fossil Fuel Science (CFFS) is a {{research}} consortium with participants from the University of Kentucky, University of Pittsburgh, University of Utah, West Virginia University, and Auburn University. The CFFS is conducting {{a research}} program to develop C 1 chemistry technology {{for the production of}} clean transportation fuel from resources such as coal and natural gas, which are more plentiful domestically than petroleum. The processes under development will convert feedstocks containing one carbon atom per molecular unit into ultra clean liquid transportation fuels (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) and hydrogen, which many believe will be the transportation fuel of the future. These feedstocks include synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen produced by coal gasification or reforming of natural gas, methane, methanol, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Some highlights of the results obtained {{during the first year of}} the current research contract are summarized as: (1) Terminal alkynes are an effective chain initiator for Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactions, producing normal paraffins with C numbers {ge} to that of the added alkyne. (2) Significant improvement in the product distribution towards heavier hydrocarbons (C{sub 5 } to C{sub 19 }) was achieved in supercritical fluid (SCF) FT reactions compared to that of gas-phase reactions. (3) Xerogel and aerogel silica supported cobalt catalysts were successfully employed for FT synthesis. Selectivity for diesel range products increased with increasing Co content. (4) Silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) molecular sieve catalysts have been developed for methanol to olefin conversion, producing value-added products such as ethylene and propylene. (5) Hybrid Pt-promoted tungstated and sulfated zirconia catalysts are very effective in cracking n-C{sub 36 } to jet and diesel fuel; these catalysts will be tested for cracking of FT wax. (6) Methane, ethane, and propane are readily decomposed to pure hydrogen and carbon nanotubes using binary Fe-based catalysts containing Mo, Ni, or Pd in a single step non-oxidative reaction. (7) Partial dehydrogenation of liquid hydrocarbons (cyclohexane and <b>methyl</b> <b>cyclohexane)</b> has been performed using catalysts consisting of Pt and other metals on stacked-cone carbon nanotubes.

40|$|The present thesis aims at spherical dendrimers with generation-specifically {{incorporated}} fluorescent solvatation probes. Knowledge of solvatation of {{the area}} between the core and the periphery should contribute essentially to the basic understanding of these macromolecules. In particular, the role of solvatation in directed energy and charge transfer processes is not known sufficiently. Firstly, {{the development of new}} phenylene alkylene dendrons via palladium catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of aryl halogenides and in situ prepared alkyl boranes by an orthogonal, convergent approach is demonstrated. The 3, 5 -dihalogen homoallyl benzenes 15 and 28 were found to be suitable in the synthesis of the G 2 dendron 32 on a gram scale. The main part introduces a concept that schedules for the incorporation of solvatochromic, selectively excitable phenyl pyrene derivatives in a specific generation and the equipment of all others by an inactive alkyl pyrene analogue, the so-called volume dummy. According to this a series of phenyl pyrenes 45 b-n and corresponding alkyl-bridged compounds 47 and 57 were synthesized and investigated by photophysical methods in detail. As a suitable pair of probe and dummy the two benzonitrile derivatives 45 b and 57 were chosen. 45 b can be excited exclusively in the presence of even an excess of 47 with light of lexc ? 360 nm and shows a positive solvatochromism of lmax = 36 nm (<b>methyl</b> <b>cyclohexane</b> vs. acetonitrile) in the fluorescence. Both compounds were functionalized by a second substitution at the pyrene and connected to the benzylic alcohols 84 and 85 via ether bond formation to give the branching units 86 - 88 on a 10 g scale. From these the complementary G 2 phenylene alkylene dendrons 91 and 92 were synthesized. Their structures were unequivocally confirmed by NMR, MALDI-TOF-MS, and SEC. Test reactions indicated the possible threefold connection to a benzene core to yield the dendrimers 93 and 94. Most of the reactions used in the 14 -step sequence generating the target compounds 93 and 94 (in each case) proceeded in good or very good yields. The concept presented seems to be capable of bearing the goal. Other parts of this thesis deal with the synthesis of the tris(bipyridine) ruthenium(II) complex 100 that contains a pyrene substituent at one of the ligands 5 -positions (crystal structure), first steps to a multiple alkylated pyrene core molecule and the exploration of the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling in the preparation of hyperbranched polymers...|$|E
40|$|Photochemical {{oxidation}} of biogenic (Isoprene) and anthropogenic (1 -octene) hydrocarbons are examined. Experiments {{studied the}} individual daylight reactions of both isoprene and 1 -octene, {{including those of}} OH, O 3, and O([superscript 3]P). Results from both the smog chamber experiments and computer kinetic modeling were then used to develop photochemical oxidation mechanisms for each hydrocarbon. Aerosols formed by isoprene and another biogenic, beta-pinene, are characterized. The OH reaction with isoprene is studied. Methyl nitrite photolysis experiments were carried out in an outdoor smog chamber {{in an attempt to}} identify as completely as possible OH-isoprene product spectrum. Emphasis was placed on identification and quantification of oxygenated products. The design of a Tenax-based cryo-trap thermal desorber used to trap, concentrate, and dry chamber samples for identification on a GC/MS is described. Analysis of the products revealed that O([superscript 3]P) can form in reaction systems designed to study OH reactions that include high concentrations of NO, and consequently NO 2, hence this reaction is also examined. The yields of methacrolein and methyl vinyl ketone are determined as 25 ± 3 and 35. 5 ± 4 %, respectively, with an additional 5. 1 ± 3 % as 3 -methyl furan, totaling 66 ± 3 %. These results, combined with those of previous studies-allow 80 % of isoprene's products to be explicitly identified, and the general structure of the remaining products to be ascertained. The O([superscript 3]P) reaction produces 84 ± 8 % epoxides, and 8 ± 3 % species which result in production of HO 2, and subsequently OH. A heretofore unidentified product of the O([superscript 3]P) reaction, 2, 2 methyl butenal, is identified. The rate constant of the NO 2 -isoprene reaction is measured. A series of experiments have been carried out to study the ozone-isoprene reaction in a smog chamber using externally produced O 3, added to the hydrocarbon in the dark. A chemical tracer, <b>methyl</b> <b>cyclohexane,</b> was added to probe the OH formation in the system. O([superscript 3]P) formation was also examined using the known distribution of products that are unique to the O([superscript 3]P) -isoprene reaction (part 1). The results provide clear evidence that both OH and O([superscript 3]P) are produced from the O 3 -isoprene reaction directly in large quantities; about 0. 68 ± 0. 15 and 0. 45 ± 0. 15 per O 3 -isoprene reaction, respectively. These additional radicals severely complicate the analysis of the O 3 reaction, hence computer kinetic modeling was necessary to ascertain the products of the O 3 reaction itself. The product spectrum, which differs dramatically from that published previously, is: 67 ± 9 % methacrolein, 26 ± 6 % methyl vinyl ketone, and 7 ± 3 % propene, accounting for 100 ± 10 % of the reacted isoprene. Applicability of these results to the gas-phase O 3 reaction with other unsaturated hydrocarbons is briefly discussed. The photooxidation chemistry of 1 -octene is examined in detail. Formation of OH from the O 3 reaction was examined {{with the use of a}} tracer/absorber, <b>methyl</b> <b>cyclohexane.</b> The O 3 - 1 -octene reaction is found to produce, apparently directly, significant quantities of OH, 0. 55 + 0. 2 on a per molecule reacted 1 -octene basis. Almost 100 % of the reacted 1 -octene could be accounted for as 80 ± 10 % heptanal, 11 ± 6 % thermally stabilized Criegee biradical, and about 1 % hexane. The OH - 1 -octene reaction was found to produce only 15 ± 5 % heptanal. The remainder is assumed to result in the formation of alkyl nitrates (32 %), and isomerization and eventual formation of multisubstituted products (52 %). A separate experiment examining the O([superscript 3]P) - 1 -octene reaction, showed that 1 -octyl oxide accounted for about 80 % of the reacted 1 -octene. A photochemical model was developed for 1 -octene oxidation, and is compared with smog chamber results from NO/NO 2 -octene experiments. The most crucial factor in the performance of the model is the quantity of assumed alkyl nitrate formation. A mechanism for the oxidation of isoprene is developed and includes the recent developments on each of isoprene's atmospherically important reactions: O 3, OH, O([superscript 3]P), and NO 3. The mechanism is tested against chamber data that includes a range of mixtures of these reactions. While it performs reasonably well under conditions where the OH and O([superscript 3]P) reactions dominate, it tends to over predict O 3 formation, as well as the speed of development of O 3 under conditions where the O 3 and NO 3 reactions are important. The NO 3 reaction is the most uncertain aspect of the isoprene mechanism, and may be responsible for a large part of this discrepancy. The discrepancy may also arise from the difficulty in extrapolating the results of O 3 experimental results, necessarily carried out in the absence of NOx, to conditions that include significant concentrations of NOx. An extensive set of outdoor smog chamber experiments was carried out to study aerosol formation by two representative biogenic hydrocarbons: isoprene and beta-pinene. The hydrocarbons, at concentrations ranging from a few ppb to a few ppm, were photooxidized in the presence of NOx. Isoprene was found to produce negligible aerosol at ambient conditions, whereas beta-pinene aerosol carbon yields were as high as 8 %, depending strongly on the hydrocarbon to NOx ratio. Aerosol samples subjected to infrared absorption spectroscopy revealed that the dominant aerosol products for both isoprene and beta-pinene are organic nitrates, organic acids, as well as other carbonyls and hydroxy compounds. GCMS of the neutral fraction of the beta-pinene aerosol revealed nopinone and several other compounds with molecular weights ranging from 138 - 200 amu, indicating mainly mono- and dioxygenated products. The average vapor pressure of the 13 -pinene aerosol was estimated to be 37 ± 24 ppt at 31 C. Scanning electron micrographs showed that the particles consist of both liquid droplets and agglomerates of small (40 - 60 nm) solid particles...|$|E
40|$|The {{final report}} {{summarizes}} the accomplishments toward project goals during {{length of the}} project. The goal of this project was to integrate coal into a refinery {{in order to produce}} coal-based jet fuel, with the major goal to examine the products other than jet fuel. These products are in the gasoline, diesel and fuel oil range and result from coal-based jet fuel production from an Air Force funded program. The main goal of Task 1 was the production of coal-based jet fuel and other products that would need to be utilized in other fuels or for non-fuel sources, using known refining technology. The gasoline, diesel fuel, and fuel oil were tested in other aspects of the project. Light cycle oil (LCO) and refined chemical oil (RCO) were blended, hydrotreated to removed sulfur, and hydrogenated, then fractionated in the original production of jet fuel. Two main approaches, taken during the project period, varied where the fractionation took place, in order to preserve the life of catalysts used, which includes (1) fractionation of the hydrotreated blend to remove sulfur and nitrogen, followed by a hydrogenation step of the lighter fraction, and (2) fractionation of the LCO and RCO before any hydrotreatment. Task 2 involved assessment of the impact of refinery integration of JP- 900 production on gasoline and diesel fuel. Fuel properties, ignition characteristics and engine combustion of model fuels and fuel samples from pilot-scale production runs were characterized. The model fuels used to represent the coal-based fuel streams were blended into full-boiling range fuels to simulate the mixing of fuel streams within the refinery to create potential 'finished' fuels. The representative compounds of the coal-based gasoline were cyclohexane and <b>methyl</b> <b>cyclohexane,</b> and for the coal-base diesel fuel they were fluorine and phenanthrene. Both the octane number (ON) of the coal-based gasoline and the cetane number (CN) of the coal-based diesel were low, relative to commercial fuels ({approx} 60 ON for coal-based gasoline and {approx} 20 CN for coal-based diesel fuel). Therefore, the allowable range of blending levels was studied where the blend would achieve acceptable performance. However, in both cases of the coal-based fuels, their ignition characteristics may make them ideal fuels for advanced combustion strategies where lower ON and CN are desirable. Task 3 was designed to develop new approaches for producing ultra clean fuels and value-added chemicals from refinery streams involving coal {{as a part of the}} feedstock. It consisted of the following three parts: (1) desulfurization and denitrogenation which involves both new adsorption approach for selective removal of nitrogen and sulfur and new catalysts for more effective hydrotreating and the combination of adsorption denitrogenation with hydrodesulfurization; (2) saturation of two-ring aromatics that included new design of sulfur resistant noble-metal catalysts for hydrogenation of naphthalene and tetralin in middle distillate fuels, and (3) value-added chemicals from naphthalene and biphenyl, which aimed at developing value-added organic chemicals from refinery streams such as 2, 6 -dimethylnaphthalene and 4, 4 {prime}-dimethylbiphenyl as precursors to advanced polymer materials. Major advances were achieved in this project in designing the catalysts and sorbent materials, and in developing fundamental understanding. The objective of Task 4 was to evaluate the effect of introducing coal into an existing petroleum refinery on the fuel oil product, specifically trace element emissions. Activities performed to accomplish this objective included analyzing two petroleum-based commercial heavy fuel oils (i. e., No. 6 fuel oils) as baseline fuels and three co-processed fuel oils, characterizing the atomization performance of a No. 6 fuel oil, measuring the combustion performance and emissions of the five fuels, specifically major, minor, and trace elements when fired in a watertube boiler designed for natural gas/fuel oil, and determining the boiler performance when firing the five fuels. Two different co-processed fuel oils were tested: one that had been partially hydrotreated, and the other a product of fractionation before hydrotreating. Task 5 focused on examining refining methods that would utilize coal and produce thermally stable jet fuel, included delayed coking and solvent extraction. Delayed coking was done on blends of decant oil and coal, with the goal to produce a premium carbon product and liquid fuels. Coking was done on bench scale and large laboratory scale cokers. Two coals were examined for co-coking, using Pittsburgh seam coal and Marfork coal product. Reactions in the large, laboratory scaled coker were reproducible in yields of products and in quality of products. While the co-coke produced from both coals was of sponge coke quality, minerals left in the coke made it unacceptable for use as anode or graphite grade filler...|$|E
40|$|Complex nanostructured self-assemblies such as {{colloidal}} suspensions, micelles, immiscible mixtures, microemulsions, etc., {{represent a}} challenge for conventional methods of simulation due {{to the presence of}} different time scales in their dynamics. In this work the novel computer simulations technique, Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) has been applied to model the self-aggregation of amphiphiles in aqueous systems, microemulsions and at the water-air interface. The DPD parameters have been calculated by Monte-Carlo Simulations and this work showed that the parameter calculation used is suitable for complicated systems. The application of Dissipative Particle Dynamics studies of amphiphilic surfactants in aqueous solution has been successfully extended to the complicated poly (ethylene oxide) -block- poly (propylene oxide) -block- poly (ethylene oxide) triblock copolymers. The computationally achieved phase diagram of EO 13 PO 30 EO 13 in water at 300 K was in remarkable agreement with the experimental phase diagram and showed the micellar, hexagonal, lamellar and inverse micellar phase. The less complicated surfactants C 10 E 4, C 12 E 5 and C 12 E 6 have been investigated with DPD to yield structural data of the observed phases. I have successfully applied Dissipative Particles Dynamics to simulate the self-assembly of C 10 E 4 and C 12 E 5 in water. It was possible to distinguish between the isotropic L 1 and L 2 phases as well as the lamellar Lα phase. The simulated bilayer thickness of C 10 E 4 was esim= 4. 9 nm which is in good agreement with the experimental value of eexp= 5. 0 nm± 0. 5 nm. The micellar aggregation number for C 10 E 4 was calculated to 53 ± 10 molecules. The bilayer thickness and aggregation number for C 12 E 5 and C 12 E 6 were calculated as well. C 12 E 5 gave a simulated bilayer thickness of esim= 6. 3 nm in comparison to an experimental value of eexp= 6. 0 nm and a micellar aggregation number of 98 ± 14. The simulated bilayer thickness of C 12 E 6 was esim= 7. 7 nm and the simulated micellar aggregation number was 79 ± 16 which is very close to the experimental value of 87. This structural investigation proved that the DPD method is not just suitable to reproduce the phase behavior of amphiphilic surfactants and polymers qualitatively but also quantitatively. The DPD simulation of microemulsion systems has not been compared in the literature with experimental results but was applied on model surfactants. The Dissipative Particles Dynamics method to simulate the self-assembly of C 10 E 4 in water has been successfully used. It was possible to distinguish between the w/o, o/w and bicontinuous microemulsions as well as the lamellar Lα. The simulation results of C 10 E 4 in water and n-decane are in good agreement with the experimental phase diagram. The X-point shift has been found at a concentration very close the experimental value. The simulation of the quaternary system C 10 E 4 /PEP 5 -PEO 5 /water/n-decande did also match the experimental results very well and the boosting-effect was found computationally with DPD. The possibility to easily modify the polymer as well as the surfactant to observe the influence of these changes to the so-called X-point opens up a great opportunity to many industrial applications. The X-point characterizes the efficiency of a surfactant in washing processes. The simulation results of the X-point shift from g= 15 % (d= 0 %) to g= 10 % (d= 5 %) are in remarkable agreement with the experimental values. The boosting–effect could not be observed by adding a PPO 5 -PEO 5 diblock copolymer which agrees with the experimental results where these systems also did not show an X-point shift. It was now possible to get a detailed insight into the mechanism of the boosting–effect with this novel computer simulation technique. Experiments suggested that the mechanism of the boosting-effect is more likely based on the modification {{of the structure of the}} bicontinuous microemulsion phase by smoothing the interface caused by the polymer. The replacement of surfactant molecules by the bigger polymer molecules which would not depend significantly on the kind of polymer is not important. The computer simulations support the assumption that the change of the bicontinuous microemulsion structure caused by the polymer molecules play the major role in the mechanism and that the replacement of surfactant molecules by the polymer is not as important. It was also possible to calculate the experimentally unknown phase behavior of poly (ethylene butylene) -block-poly (ethylene oxide) diblock copolymer in water and <b>methyl</b> <b>cyclohexane.</b> The three different phases found like oil-in-water, water-in-oil droplets and a bicontinuous microemulsion phase, as well as the character of the thermodynamic model, indicate the formation of a microemulsion in this polymer/water/oil system. The DPD method has been applied to an experimentally uninvestigated system for the first time and produced interesting results. With these new insights in the phase behavior of the polymer – water – oil system many new applications are possible. The introduction of the air beads into the DPD methods opens up a wide range of new applications. For the first time the surface tension has been calculated with Dissipative Particle Dynamics while the systems published in the literature just dealt with interfacial tension between two condensed phases. The shape of the experimental surface tension diagram of C 10 E 4, C 12 E 5 and C 12 E 6 at the water – air interface has been reproduced with DPD. In the simulated as well as in the experimental graphs C 10 E 4 has a clearly higher cmc with a lower surface tension than C 12 E 5 and C 12 E 6 which have very similar cmc and surface tension. The conversion of the DPD surface tension to physical units shows an acceptable agreement. Together with the qualitative agreement of experiments and simulations the quantitative comparison makes predictions of surface tension of unknown surfactants and polymers possible. All calculation results are in remarkable agreement with the experimental data. In the present work the applications of the method have been extended significantly. The simulation of simple surfactant-water systems has been used to obtain structural information. Oil has been added and even microemulsion formations of ternary and quaternary systems have been observed. A completely new field – the DPD calculation of the surface tension – has been opened by the introduction of air beads. The DPD method proved to be a reliable tool to get a better understanding of the nanostructure of self-assemblies and structural information. It was even possible to investigate an experimentally unknown system and the method is therefore applicable to support the often complicated experiments or even to obtain experimentally unavailable data. With this method it is easily possible to predict the properties of compounds and in this way to avoid expensive experiments by suggesting promising candidates for certain industrial applications. To our knowledge DPD is a unique method to simulate mesoscopic structures on a relatively long time scale based on an intermolecular interaction level...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{application}} of membrane technology to molecular separation processes has stimulated interest and showed great potential {{in a number of}} industrial fields. A new membrane market is arising in the chemical industry where many in-process separation problems can be tackled elegantly by sufficiently stable membranes. Since the 1990 s progress has also been made in the development of solvent resistant nanofiltration membranes, opening the possibility to tackle several separation problems in non-aqueous solvents. Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) offers great perspectives towards wide application in the process industry as it provides a facile, energy-efficient and scalable alternative to conventional separation processes such as distillation, liquid-liquid extraction or chromatographic purification. It has been proven that OSN has an enormous potential in many solvent intensive pharmaceutical and fine-chemical processes, where it can be used for the recovery, concentration and purification of valuable target molecules, {{as well as for the}} purification and recycling of spent solvents. Here, ceramic nanofiltration membranes with their broad solvent resistance and high temperature stability, have the potential to take a significant market share. The state-of-the-art nanoporous ceramic membranes for OSN are transition metal oxide membranes, containing a large amount of surface OH-groups, making them strongly hydrophilic. By exchanging these hydroxyl groups by a more apolar group (such as alkyl, perfluoroalkyl, [...] .), the surface becomes more hydrophobic, increasing non-polar solvent fluxes. Recently, VITO and UA have developed a new versatile grafting method (modification with Grignard reagents) capable of attaching a direct, non-hydrolysable bond between the membrane surface and the functional group. This results in novel membranes with a wide range of surface functionalities. The approach used in this thesis is to investigate the properties, performance and potential of these grafted membranes in organic solvent nanofiltration. The properties of the Grignard modified membranes were examined by physico – chemical characterisation (contact angle measurements, micro-ATR/FTIR-spectroscopy) in addition to performance characterisation (flux and retention measurements). All observations for modified membranes are consistent with the assumed partial replacement of the OH-groups on the membrane surface and the consequent amphiphilic character of the modified membrane surface. Moreover, the solvent filtration performance and application potential of such Grignard functionalised membranes was further evaluated and explored. To this purpose, the retention behavior of a variety of 5 different model solvent/solute mixtures was determined for a variety of grafted and ungrafted membranes. The varying retention behaviour was evaluated by considering the changing affinity of solvents and solutes for the modified and unmodified membrane surfaces. To support this interpretation, a sorption test was used to quantify the solute-membrane affinity. A long-term test was performed in order to check the stability of grafted groups on the surface of the membrane. Further experimental work was directed to understand how to tune solvent-membrane-solute interactions in a controlled way in order to enhance OSN performance. This was achieved by performing an extensive retention study on two type of Grignard functionalised membranes, choosing three PEG molecules and polystyrene as solutes, all with almost the same size but different polarities, in a wide range of solvents including water, ethanol, dimethylformamide (DMF), isopropanol, acetone, dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF), methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), toluene, ethyl acetate, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexane and <b>methyl</b> <b>cyclohexane.</b> To unravel the transport mechanism properly, the pressure effect of flux and retentions was thoroughly investigated. The retention results showed in general a very different behaviour in different ranges of polarity: at low solvent polarity, retentions are relatively low, varying with pressure and solvent polarity; at high solvent polarity, retentions are relatively high, and independent of pressure and solvent polarity. The Spiegler-Kedem theory, taking into account both diffusion and convection transport mechanisms, was used as a basis for a fundamental explanation of the results and explaining the competing contribution of diffusion and convection in solute transport. Finally, this study demonstrates the importance of all solvent-membrane-solute interactions in the OSN transport, but also shows how they can be manipulated to enhance the membrane performance.
