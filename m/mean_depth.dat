25|$|In fluid dynamics, Airy wave theory (often {{referred}} to as linear wave theory) gives a linearised description of the propagation of gravity waves {{on the surface of}} a homogeneous fluid layer. The theory assumes that the fluid layer has a uniform <b>mean</b> <b>depth,</b> and that the fluid flow is inviscid, incompressible and irrotational. This theory was first published, in correct form, by George Biddell Airy in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Stokes' wave theory, {{when using}} a low {{order of the}} {{perturbation}} expansion (e.g. up to second, third or fifth order), is valid for non-linear waves on intermediate and deep water, that is for wavelengths (λ) not large {{as compared with the}} <b>mean</b> <b>depth</b> (h). In shallow water, the low-order Stokes expansion breaks down (gives unrealistic results) for appreciable wave amplitude (as compared to the depth). Then, Boussinesq approximations are more appropriate. Further approximations on Boussinesq-type (multi-directional) wave equations lead – for one-way wave propagation – to the Korteweg–de Vries equation or the Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equation. Like (near) exact Stokes-wave solutions, these two equations have solitary wave (soliton) solutions, besides periodic-wave solutions known as cnoidal waves.|$|E

The model shows excellent agreement between observed and pre-dicted average phosphorus concentrations for lakes {{with a wide range}} of hydraulic detention times (1 to 700 years) and <b>mean</b> <b>depths</b> (14 to 313 meters).

40|$|The {{scaling of}} positron-implantation (stopping) {{profiles}} {{has been reported}} by Ghosh et al., who used the BNL Monte Carlo scheme to generate stopping profiles in semi-infinite elemental metals. A simple scaling relationship reduced the stopping profiles of positrons implanted at different energies (ranging from 18 ̆ 21110 keV) onto a single universal curve for that particular metal. We have confirmed that the scaling relationship also applies to the quite different Jensen and Walker Monte Carlo scheme, for more materials, and over an expanded energy range of 18 ̆ 21125 keV. The <b>mean</b> <b>depths</b> of the stopping profiles calculated by the two Monte Carlo schemes {{are found to be}} different, mainly due to differences in the inelastic mean free paths and the energy-loss functions. However, after scaling, the profiles generated by the two schemes can be superimposed onto a single curve which can be appropriately parametrized. The scaled profiles are found to be only weakly material dependent. The <b>mean</b> <b>depths,</b> backscattered fractions, and scaled stopping profiles are fitted to simple parametric functions, and the values of these parameters are obtained for several elements.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of oscillaxanthin in new cores {{is different from}} that of cores taken carlier from the same regions. The vertical {{distribution of}} oscillaxanthin in six recent cores was qualitatively similar, showing low surface values and three maxima; quantitatively they varied, depending largely upon location, both in total oscillaxanthin (17. 00 to 56. 16 pug cm’), and in the depth below which none was found (10. 5 to 20. 5 cm). Cores taken in I 967 had maxima in the surface ccntimctcr and at <b>mean</b> <b>depths</b> of 3. 5 cm and 7. 5 cm, whereas 1972 cores had very little in the top 4 cm, and the three maxima had moved down to <b>mean</b> <b>depths</b> of 5. 45 cm, 7. 85 cm, and 10. 35 cm. The present paucity of surface oscil-laxanthin reflects the diminution of Oscillatoria in the lake resulting from the diversion of scwagc. On the basis of the changes in positions of the shallow maxima it appears that the top 4. 95 cm of the sediment in the new cores was deposited in 5. 5 years, between 1967 and 2972.
