40|$|Solid pure {{ruthenium}} phthalocyanine, {{obtained from}} its adduct [PcRu(DMSO) (2) ]. 2 DMSO, is an amorphous material, and its structure has been {{examined by the}} large-angle X-ray scattering (LAXS) technique. Experimental data are best fitted by assuming that ruthenium phthalocyanine is dimeric, i. e. (PcRu) (2), with a short intradimer Ru-(II) -Ru(II) contact (2. 40 Angstrom), six dimeric units, on average, closely approaching one another and stacked in a <b>monodimensional</b> <b>array.</b> (PcRu) (2) is paramagnetic with a room-temperature magnetic moment (2. 54) B), which is strongly temperature dependent in the range 300 - 6 K. Interpretation of the magnetic behavior leads to an electronic energy level diagram which locates the highest energy electrons for the dimer in the orbital sequence sigma(2) pi(4) delta(2) delta*(2) pi*(2). The electrical conductivity value sigma(RT), 1 x 10 (- 5) Omega(- 1) cm(- 1) is also considered {{in the light of}} the structural features of the complex. (PcRu) (2), stable to air as a solid material, easily interacts with dioxygen when in contact with tetrahydrofuran. Dioxygen activation and oxygen atom transfer are observed for ruthenium phthalocyanine in the oxidation of 1 -octene by O- 2 in tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of (C 6 H 5 CN) (2) PdCl 2 as the olefin activator, with selective formation of 2 -octanone. Catalytic experiments were carried out at room temperature and at a p(O- 2) of 50 atm. The optimized conditions for oxidation involve a Fe:Pd:olefin molar ratio of about 1 : 1. 7 : 40...|$|E
