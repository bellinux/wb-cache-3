5|$|Chopin's music {{remains very}} popular and is {{regularly}} performed, recorded and broadcast worldwide. The world's oldest <b>monographic</b> music competition, the International Chopin Piano Competition, founded in 1927, is held {{every five years}} in Warsaw. The Fryderyk Chopin Institute of Poland lists on its website over eighty societies worldwide devoted to the composer and his music. The Institute site also lists nearly 1,500 performances of Chopin works on YouTube as of January 2014.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Alefeld (1820–1872), {{who used}} Latin variety names, in a <b>monographic</b> study of beans, lentils and other legumes {{distinguished}} three infraspecific taxonomic categories: Unterart (subspecies), Varietäten Gruppe and Kultur-Varietät, all with Latin names. In doing this {{he was probably}} laying the ground for the later establishment of the cultigen classification categories cultivar and Group. In conjunction with the Brussels International Botanical Congress of 1910 there was an International Horticultural Congress having a horticultural nomenclature component.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have been}} the focus of <b>monographic</b> series, action plans, field guides, and classic works in ethology. However, few species have been {{thoroughly}} studied to date, and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species. Field studies have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, neither Volvaria nor Volvariopsis {{would be}} used as the correct name for this group. The generic name Volvariella, {{proposed}} by the Argentinean mycologist Carlos Luis Spegazzini in 1899, would be adopted for this group in 1953 after a proposal to conserve Kummer’s Volvaria against De Candolle’s Volvaria was rejected by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi established under the principles of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. The combination Volvariella earlei would be made by Robert L. Shaffer, who authored the first comprehensive <b>monographic</b> revision of Volvariella in North America in 1957.|$|E
5|$|The IAPT {{established}} two Engler Medals {{in honour of}} Adolf Engler in 1986: the Engler Medal in Gold awarded {{every six}} years for outstanding lifetime contributions to plant taxonomy and presented since 1987 at each International Botanical Congress (IBC), and the Engler Medal in Silver (medal sensu lato) awarded from 1987 to 2001 for a monograph or other work in systematic botany and presented from 1990 to 2002 at various meetings, congresses, symposia, etc. In 2002 the latter medal was divided into three awards for outstanding publications in these areas: the Engler Medal in Silver (medal sensu stricto) awarded for <b>monographic</b> or floristic plant systematics; the Stafleu Medal awarded for historical, bibliographic, and/or nomenclatural aspects of plant systematics; and the Stebbins Medal awarded for phylogenetic plant systematics and/or plant evolution. The medals honor Adolf Engler (24 Mar. 1844-10 Oct. 1930), Frans Antonie Stafleu (8 Sep. 1921-16 Dec. 1997), and George Ledyard Stebbins, Jr. (6 Jan. 1906-19 Jan. 2000).|$|E
25|$|Secondly its <b>monographic</b> {{character}} is remarkable. It {{is the first}} <b>monographic</b> work for spiders in German language. Further 180 {{years ago it was}} very unusual to use a group like spiders as a sole subject of a book. Apart from a natural history of spiders by the Frenchman Walckenaer in 1806 there had been no work of that time which exclusively had spiders as its subject.|$|E

25|$|Herseni {{adopted a}} tactic of {{publishing}} {{his work in}} stages, from raw studies in Societatea de Mâine to <b>monographic</b> series, and finally to synthetic volumes and brochures. One such work was printed at Gusti's expense, as Monografia sociologică; rostul, metoda și problemele ei ("The Sociological Monograph; Its Purpose, Method and Issues"), then reissued in 1934 as Teoria monografiei sociologice ("The Theory of Sociological Monographs"), {{to be used as}} a standard ISR manual. Gusti also backed Herseni's candidature as chair of the University of Cluj sociology department, vacated after Virgil Bărbat's death. The project failed when local academics elected one of their own, Constantin Sudețeanu, and prompted a much-publicized scandal.|$|E
25|$|The {{personal}} {{archives of}} photographers Carlotta Corpron (1901–1988), Nell Dorr (1893–1988), Laura Gilpin (1891–1979), Eliot Porter (1901–1990), Erwin E. Smith (1886–1947), and Karl Struss (1886–1981) are prominent collection resources. Finding aids and guides for {{these and other}} <b>monographic</b> collections are available online under the Collections/Photographs/Learn More tabs on the ACMAA website.The ACMAA photography collection contains early images of Americans at war, anchored by 55 Mexican-American War (1847-1848) daguerreotypes. The collection houses a copy of Alexander Gardner’s two-volume work, Gardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the Civil War {{and a copy of}} Photographic Views of Sherman’s Campaign (1865) by George Barnard. A group of more than 1,400 nineteenth and early twentieth-century portraits of Native Americans that originated with the Bureau of American Ethnology is another of the collection’s highlights, along with a complete set of Edward Curtis's The North American Indian.|$|E
500|$|In 1921, Charles H. Sternberg {{recovered}} a partial skull (PMU.R1250) {{from what is}} now known as the slightly younger Kirtland Formation in San Juan County, New Mexico. This specimen was sent to Uppsala, Sweden, where Carl Wiman described it as a second species, P. tubicen, in 1931. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin tǔbǐcěn [...] "trumpeter". A second, nearly complete P. tubicen skull (NMMNH P-25100) was found in New Mexico in 1995. Using computed tomography of this skull, Robert Sullivan and Thomas Williamson gave the genus a <b>monographic</b> treatment in 1999, covering aspects of its anatomy and taxonomy, and the functions of its crest. Williamson later published an independent review of the remains, disagreeing with the taxonomic conclusions.|$|E

2500|$|After 1965, when {{he entered}} a new period of {{prolific}} writing, Herseni sought to accumulate direct knowledge {{in the field of}} industrial sociology, reviving and adapting Gusti's (and his own) interwar methodology: a <b>monographic</b> [...] "problem-centered" [...] technique, and a focus on interdisciplinarity. Herseni involved himself in debates about the future of sociology, defending the science against criticism, and arguing that sociologists could answer specific problems that could not be addressed by statisticians or economists.|$|E
2500|$|Sherff {{recognized}} {{the uniqueness of}} T. hawaiensis, a judgement that was corroborated by subsequent evidence. He understood that T. waimeae and T. waialealae are closely related and that these two belong in a group with T. oahuensis, T. lydgatei, and T. bisattenuata. He placed Pterotropia in synonymy under Tetraplasandra, writing that [...] "a <b>monographic</b> study of Tetraplasandra reveals so much interlocking and overlapping of characters between Tetraplasandra and the species assigned to Pterotropia as to remove all warrant for their segregation".|$|E
2500|$|Described by {{his peers}} as a [...] "fine intellectual", [...] "paralyzed by discreetness", or a [...] "withdrawn scholar, without an {{expansive}} public persona", Claudian was a respected, but often overlooked, figure in Romanian sociology—according to Z. Ornea, this was [...] "probably because, {{although he did}} take part in one annual research, he was not involved with Dimitrie Gusti's <b>monographic</b> school." [...] The same was noted by Gusti's pupil, Henri H. Stahl, who saw Claudian as [...] "for sure {{one of our best}} sociologists", but linked primarily to Zeletin, Andrei, and Sanielevici (Claudian had reportedly praised Sanielevici in particular as a [...] "genius" [...] anthropologist).|$|E
2500|$|Rainer's anthropometric work, {{which used}} for a {{permanent}} record peasant photographs, in large part taken by Milcu, remains a problematic aspect of Gustian sociology. As noted by cultural historian Z. Ornea (based on Stahl's recollections), Rainer [...] "carried out unperturbed his anthropometric research, although {{he was not an}} adept of racial science and had no idea of what this anthropometry and blood chemistry [...] were going to be used for. And yet, the great professor of histology would return annually to the villages that were studied by the <b>monographic</b> teams and to carry out this research with no purpose and no finality." [...] Anthropologist Vintilă Mihăilescu also notes that the combination of Gusti's sociology and Rainer's physical anthropology was a [...] "domestic ethnology", [...] "self-referential" [...] and [...] "biased", but nevertheless an [...] "important tool" [...] for later cultural anthropology.|$|E
2500|$|Comparing {{around a}} quarter of the size records from the first edition against shells in the {{collections}} of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Rosenberg found that the latter had larger specimens in some 10% of cases. What Rosenberg considered [...] "f greatest concern", however, were discrepancies between the record sizes listed in the registry and larger specimens found in contemporary <b>monographic</b> works, and this even extended to type specimens in some cases. The problem seemed to be particularly pronounced in the Pleurotomariidae—a family highly prized by shell collectors—where nine out of sixteen species had larger shells listed in the standard work on the family, that of Anseeuw & Goto (1996). Similar issues were found with the record sizes of Terebridae. Rosenberg concluded: [...] "The Registry would be much more authoritative if it included record sizes from the literature, and I recommend this be done in future editions." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1913, {{the first}} public showing in the United States of Kirchner's work {{took place at the}} Armory Show, which was also the first major display of modern art in America.

In 1969, a major retrospective of paintings, drawings,and prints traveled to the Seattle Art Museum, the Pasadena Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In 1992, the National Gallery of Art, [...] Washington, held a <b>monographic</b> show, using its existing collection; a major international loan exhibition took place in 2003. In November 2006 at Christie's, Kirchner's Street Scene, Berlin (1913) fetched $38 million, a record for the artist. From 3 August to 10 November 2008, the Museum of Modern Art in New York held a major exhibition that [...] "probably comprises the very best of his oeuvre." ...|$|E
2500|$|During his lifetime, Hopper's {{own work}} as well as his {{collection}} was shown in <b>monographic</b> and group exhibitions around the world including the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota; the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg; MAK Vienna: Austrian Museum of Applied Arts/Contemporary Art, Vienna; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and the Cinémathèque Française, Paris, and the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, Melbourne. In March 2010, it was announced that Hopper was on the [...] "short list" [...] for Jeffrey Deitch's inaugural show at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA). In April 2010, Deitch confirmed that Hopper's work, curated by Julian Schnabel, will indeed be the focus of his debut at MOCA. The title of the exhibition, Double Standard, was taken from Hopper's iconic 1961 photograph of the two Standard Oil signs seen through an automobile windshield at the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard, Melrose Avenue, and North Doheny Drive on historic Route 66 in Los Angeles. The image was reproduced on the invitation for Ed Ruscha's second solo exhibition at Ferus Gallery in 1964.|$|E
