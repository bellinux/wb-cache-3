The HIFOGS spectra at large heliocentric distances exhibit strong emission peaks from 9. 9 - 10. 1 <b>microns</b> and at 11. 2 <b>microns.</b> The HIFOGS spectra of Hale-Bopp taken 1996 October 07 - 14 UT are identical in shape to the ISO SWS spectrum at 2. 8 AU obtained on 1996 October 06 UT. Magnesium-rich olivine was unambiguously identified due to presence of the expected 11. 2 <b>microns</b> peak along with the matching far-IR 18 <b>microns,</b> 23 <b>microns,</b> and 33 <b>microns</b> peaks in the ISO SWS spectrum. In contrast, to large heliocentric distances, {{we find that the}} silicate feature at small heliocentric distances (tau(sub lambda) less than or = 1. 7 AU) exhibits strong peaks at 9. 3 <b>microns,</b> 9. 9 - 10. 1 <b>microns,</b> and 11. 2 <b>microns,</b> and weak at 10. 5 <b>microns</b> and 11. 8 <b>microns.</b> We will show that the dramatic increase of the 9. 3 <b>microns</b> and 10. 0 <b>microns</b> peaks close to perihelion leads to the hypothesis that there are two crystalline grain components with significantly different temperatures. The hotter mineral species (including olivines) radiate over a large range of heliocentric distances at detectable leve!s. The cooler mineral species (pyroxenes) radiate on the Wien side of the blackbody, too faint to detect in the mid-infrared spectra, until close to the sun when this species radiates on the Reyleigh-Jeans tail and becomes apparent. Decomposition of the observed silicate emission features into mineral components through comparison of the height and shape of the silicate feature ("Flux/cont") derived from the cometary spectra, to optical extinctions (Qext) derived from laboratory measurements of terrestrial silicate minerals and interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) is successful for a combination of warm grains (consisting of olivines, amorphous olivines, amorphous pyroxenes, and layer-lattice silicates) and cool grains (crystalline pyroxenes) ...|$|R
