During and after 2038, this number will exceed 2−1, the largest number representable by a signed long integer on 32 bit systems, causing the Year 2038 problem (also known as the Unix <b>Millennium</b> <b>bug</b> or Y2K38). As a long integer in 64 bit systems uses 64 bits, the problem does not realistically exist on 64 bit systems that use the LP64 model.|$|E

2500|$|The Year 2000 problem, {{also known}} as the Y2K problem, the <b>Millennium</b> <b>bug,</b> the Y2K bug, or Y2K, is a class of {{computer}} bugs related to the formatting and storage of calendar data for dates beginning in the year 2000. [...] Problems were anticipated, and arose, because twentieth-century software often represented the four-digit year with only the final two digits—making the year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900. [...] The assumption of a twentieth-century date in such programs caused various errors, such as the incorrect display of dates and the inaccurate ordering of automated dated records or real-time events.|$|E

Although the <b>millennium</b> <b>bug</b> was by no means a terrorist attack or plot against the world or the United States, it did act as a catalyst in sparking the fears of a possibly large-scale devastating cyber-attack. Commentators noted that many of the facts of such incidents seemed to change, often with exaggerated media reports.|$|E

50|$|The Year 2038 {{problem is}} an issue for {{computing}} and data storage situations in which time values are stored or calculated as a signed 32-bit integer, and this number is interpreted {{as the number of}} seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 (the epoch). Such implementations cannot encode times after 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038, a problem similar to but not entirely analogous to the Y2K problem (also known as the <b>Millennium</b> <b>Bug),</b> in which 2-digit values representing the number of years since 1900 could not encode the year 2000 or later. Most 32-bit Unix-like systems store and manipulate time in this Unix time format, so the year 2038 problem is sometimes referred to as the Unix <b>Millennium</b> <b>Bug</b> by association.|$|E
