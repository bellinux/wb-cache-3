5|$|The episode {{received}} {{a strong and}} varied reaction from reviewers. Most heaped praise on the scenes featuring Karofsky, both the {{events leading up to}} his suicide attempt and when Kurt (Chris Colfer) visited him in the hospital. However, many felt the strength of this storyline unbalanced the episode, {{and the rest of the}} episode, particularly the Regionals competition and the Rachel and Finn wedding storyline, did not <b>measure</b> <b>up.</b> The final scene, which ended with Quinn (Dianna Agron) being in a potentially fatal car crash, was controversial.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Return of Saturn {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, although {{several of them}} were divided over its different sound to its predecessor. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 {{but was unable to}} <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> to the sales of Tragic Kingdom. The album spawned four singles, only one of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100. At the 43rd Grammy Awards, Return of Saturn was nominated for Best Rock Album.|$|E
5|$|John Elwood Shepherd, {{referred}} to more commonly as Elwood, is a 13-year-old pickpocket who joins up with powder hunters Gamma and Smith {{in an effort}} to resurrect his dead sister Sheryl Ann Shepherd. He is introduced in the first chapter of the series. His character is named after Gotee Records co-founder Joey Elwood, a real-life music producer whose name Kubo thought fit Elwood's character design perfectly. Elwood has great talent with throwing knives, and is ingenious in combat, but struggles to overcome his sidekick status and <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> to the abilities of his superhuman partners. Smith and Gamma both see Elwood as a younger version of Gamma, which fills Gamma with hope and pride, but also the fear that Elwood may turn to evil. This concern prompts Smith and Gamma to leave Elwood behind at Gemini Laboratory {{at the end of the}} manga, so that he can find his own way without Gamma's influence. Whether Elwood decides to follow the pair or not is left ambiguous.|$|E

5|$|The spores are white, smooth, roughly elliptical, {{and have}} {{dimensions}} of 7–8.5 by 5–6μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 17–23 by 7.5–10μm, and four-spored with sterigmata around 3 μm long. The paraphyses are 5–8μm wide, {{shorter than the}} basidia, more abundant and form a somewhat gelatinous layer. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the cap edge) are 60 by 7–21μm, hyaline, conical or ventricose (inflated). The tips of the cheilocystidia are drawn out to a point, or have a short appendage measuring 15 by 2–3μm, which is sometimes branched, and is thin or slightly thick-walled. There are no cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia). Pileocystidia (cystidia {{on the surface of}} the cap) are club-shaped, measuring 25–60 by 13–25μm. They are somewhat thick-walled, and spiny on the exposed surface with short simple outgrowths extending up to 3μm long. The pileocystidia are joined together and form a continuous layer over the young cap, but break up as the cap expands. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are conical or lance-shaped, hyaline, and smooth, with walls that are thin or slightly thickened. They <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> to 300 by 10–25μm, but are shorter in the upper regions of the stem. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues.|$|E

In a simple PPS design, these selection probabilities can then be used as the basis for Poisson sampling. However, this has the drawback of variable sample size, and different portions of the population may still be over- or under-represented due to chance variation in selections.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2004 Bleu landed a {{starring}} role in the television series Flight 29 Down, alongside Allen Alvarado, Hallee Hirsh, Lauren Storm, Jeremy James Kissner, Johnny Pacar and Kristy Wu, which aired for three seasons on the Discovery Kids network. The program, a juvenile version of the ABC series Lost, concerned a group of teenagers stranded on a tropical island after their plane crashes. Bleu played as Nathan McHugh, a Boy Scout whose leadership skills do not quite <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> to his self-confidence.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} the bombing was mixed. The German towns being hit {{suffered}} from severe destruction. German communications after the bombing were heavily impaired, {{and there was a}} considerable effect on the morale, especially on units consisting of more younger and inexperienced troops. However, the direct damage dealt to the German frontline troops was low, and casualties were few. Allied air commanders admitted that the bombing did not <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> to expectations. About 12 aircraft were shot down during the initial bombing by meager anti-aircraft fire.|$|E

25|$|The {{international}} {{significance of}} the West German film industry of the 1950s could no longer <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> to that of France, Italy, or Japan. German films were only rarely distributed internationally as they were perceived as provincial. International co-productions of the kind which were becoming common in France and Italy tended to be rejected by German producers (Schneider 1990:43). However a few German films and film-makers did achieve international recognition at this time, among them Bernhard Wicki's Oscar-nominated Die Brücke (The Bridge) (1959), and the actresses Hildegard Knef and Romy Schneider.|$|E
25|$|Bairam Khan led {{the army}} through the Punjab {{virtually}} unopposed. The fort of Rohtas, {{which was built}} in 1541–43 by Sher Shah Suri to crush the Gakhars who were loyal to Humayun, was surrendered without a shot by a treacherous commander. The walls of the Rohtas Fort <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> to 12.5 meters in thickness and up to 18.28 meters in height. They extend for 4km and feature 68 semi-circular bastions.

25|$|This {{has some}} {{interesting}} implications. For starters, Everett {{suggested that the}} universe is actually indeterminate as a whole. To see this, consider an observer measuring the spin of some particle, which previously is in an undetermined state (a superposition of possible spins). When you measure the spin, you may determine it to be up or down. But in fact, there has been a “splitting” of the universe into two states, one where you <b>measure</b> <b>up,</b> and the other where you measure down. Thus, the indeterminacy of the system simply grows and you become a part of it.|$|E

25|$|Dispensability in a {{group is}} {{described}} by Price as employees who join a work group and quickly begin to <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> their skills with {{the people that they}} are assigned to work with. If they feel that their skills are inferior to those around them, people tend to sit back and let the other more skilled workers carry the workload. Fairness {{in a group}} is when some group members feel that their voice is not heard in decision making because of their ethnicity, gender or other discriminatory factors. Instead of fighting for their voice to be heard many group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.|$|E
25|$|In 1973 Kelly began {{regularly}} making large-scale outdoor sculpture. Kelly gave up painted surfaces, instead choosing unvarnished steel, aluminum or bronze, {{often in}} totem-like configurations such as Curve XXIII (1981). While the totemic forms of his freestanding sculptures can <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> to 15 feet tall, his wall reliefs can span more than 14 feet wide. Kelly’s sculpture “is founded on its adherence to absolute simplicity and clarity of form.” For his 1980s sculptures, {{during this period}} of his time in Spencertown, the artist devoted {{for the first time as}} much energy to his sculptures as to his painting, and in the process producing over sixty percent of his total 140 sculptures.|$|E
25|$|Singaporean {{officials}} {{protested that}} the report did not present a full account of the incident and was incomplete, as responsibility for the accident {{appeared to have been}} placed mainly on the flight crew of SQ006, while other equally valid contributing factors had been played down. The team from Singapore that participated in the investigation felt that the lighting and signage at the airport did not <b>measure</b> <b>up</b> to international standards. Some critical lights were missing or not working. No barriers or markings were put up {{at the start of the}} closed runway, which would have alerted the flight crew that they were on the wrong runway. The Singapore team felt that these two factors were given less weight than was proper, as another flight crew had almost made the same mistake of using runway 05R to take off days before the accident.|$|E
