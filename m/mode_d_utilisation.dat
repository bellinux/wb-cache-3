40|$|Introduction: Scrutiny over {{pharmaceutical}} expenditure is increasing leading to multiple reforms. This includes Austria with measures to lower generic prices and enhance their utilisation. However {{the situation for}} newer antidepressants and atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPs) is different to PPIs, statins and renin-angiotensin drugs with greater tailoring of therapy and no wish to switch products in stable patients. Authorities welcome generics though given high costs particularly of patented AAPs. Objective: Assess (a) changes in utilisation of venlafaxine versus other newer anti-depressants before and after availability of generics, (b) utilisation of generic versus originator venlafaxine, (c) price reductions of venlafaxine over time and influence on total expenditure, (<b>d)</b> <b>utilisation</b> of risperidone versus other AAPs, (e) suggest potential additional reforms that could be introduced if pertinent. Methodology: A quasi-experimental study design with a segmented time series and an observational study. Utilisation measured in defined daily doses (DDDs) and total expenditure per DDD and over time. Results: No appreciable changes in the utilization patterns of venlafaxine and risperidone after generics. The reduction in expenditure/ DDD for venlafaxine decreased overall expenditure on antidepressants by 5 % {{by the end of}} the study versus just before generics despite a 37 % increase in utilization. Expenditure will further decrease if there was reduced prescribing of duloxetine. Conclusion: Depression, schizophrenia and bipolar diseases are complex diseases. As a result, specific measures are needed to encourage prescribing of generic risperidone and venlafaxine when multiple choices are appropriate, and authorities cannot rely on a &# 180;Hawthorne&# 180; effect between classes to enhance use of generics first line. Measures may include prescribing restrictions for duloxetine. No specific measures planned for AAPs with more generics becoming available...|$|R

40|$|LHCb is the {{dedicated}} B physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It will make precision measurements of CP violating {{effects in the}} Bd and Bs systems, as well as making precision measurements of the lifetimes of all flavours of B hadrons. In this thesis, two possible measurements of the CKM angle gamma are evaluated:from the decay <b>mode</b> B 0 <b>d</b> -> D- pi+, and from the combined analysis of the decay <b>modes</b> B 0 <b>d</b> -> D- pi+ and B 0 s -> D-s K+ under the conditions of U-spin symmetry. Also, a Monte Carlo independent method of measuring the lifetimes of B hadrons is described. The reconstruction of the decay <b>mode</b> B 0 <b>d</b> -> D- pi+ is studied using the LHCb simulation software, and a general method for categorising background at LHCb is developed. The decay <b>mode</b> B 0 <b>d</b> -> D- pi+ is {{found to have a}} yearly yield of 1340 k events, and a signal to background ratio of ~ 5. It is shown that the analysis of time dependent decay rate asymmetries in B 0 d -> D- pi+ can result in a precision of ~ 8 degrees on gamma after one year of data taking. The combined extraction of gamma from the decay <b>modes</b> B 0 <b>d</b> -> D- pi+ and B 0 s -> D-s K+ is seen to allow an unambiguous extraction of gamma, with a precision of a few degrees after one year of data taking. The LHCb trigger uses the lifetime of reconstructed particles to discriminate between signal and background, and therefore introduces a bias in the lifetime distributions of B h adrons. A method for measuring this bias, and hence the lifetimes of B hadrons, without recourse to Monte Carlo information, is developed. This method can be applied to any decay mode reconstructed at LHCb which is expected to suffer from a lifetime bias, in particular hadronic decay channels. It is shown that LHCb can expect to match the current world average precision on the B 0 s lifetime with a few weeks of data taking in the decay mode B 0 s -> D-s pi+, while the world average precision on the B 0 d lifetime can be matched with a few months of data taking in the decay <b>mode</b> B 0 <b>d</b> -> D- pi+...|$|R

30|$|There {{are good}} reasons to assume that CBA is {{bringing}} changes to assessment practice that affect organizational and technical aspects for schools and teachers, {{as well as the}} test-design itself (Jerrim 2016). The test design constitutes the framework, setting up test-taker interactions and working steps within the assessment, and has the potential to influence performance and results. In the literature, effects that are due to differences in test design are called “mode effects,” and studies describe a “difference between the latent competencies of a test-taker for two tests administered in different modes” (Kröhne and Martens 2011, p. 174). The medium of administration—in our case, computer versus paper-and-pencil—is therefore an obvious and central design feature from which mode effects can arise; “however, in practice, the simple distinction between the two test delivery strategies is only a convenient way to communicate a conglomerate of differences between the actual test administrations that might trigger mode effects and result in nonequivalent test administrations” (Kröhne and Martens 2011, p. 171). So one challenge is to describe design criteria in a transparent way for each test format, in order to form a basis for interpreting or judging the applicability of the results. Some relevant criteria at the test level that are usually used in empirical analyses are: (a) information searches, (b) multimedia elements, (c) response <b>modes,</b> (<b>d)</b> input devices, and (e) navigation.|$|R

Ammonium was closely correlated with sulfate, suggesting ammonium sulfate as the major aerosol component, but the mass ratio of ammonium to sulfate indicated that sulfate was not fully neutralized by ammonium.

Ion series analysis of the organics fraction in the mass spectrometer indicated that the major component of the organics were oxygenated organics which are a marker for aged, photochemically processed aerosol or biomass burning aerosol.
