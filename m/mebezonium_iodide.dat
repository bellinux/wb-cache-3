40|$|Tanax is a {{veterinary}} formulation for euthanasia comprising embu-tramide, <b>mebezonium</b> <b>iodide</b> and tetracaine. A 37 -year-old female {{was found}} dead on her bed, with three empty used syringes {{and a bottle of}} Tanax beside her body. Three needle puncture marks were observed on the body. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the distribution of embutramide and <b>mebezonium</b> <b>iodide</b> in different biological matrices (femoral and cardiac blood, liver, muscle and vitreous humor) using a chromatographic method for the simultan-eous determination of the two drugs. A direct and sensitive liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method was devel-oped in multiple reaction monitoring mode with positive ionization. Lidocaine was used as an internal standard. Limits of detection and quantitation of 0. 01 and 0. 05 mg/L, respectively, were reached for both compounds. Embutramide levels ranged from 2. 74 mg/L in vit-reous humor to 5. 06 mg/L in femoral blood, while <b>mebezonium</b> <b>iodide</b> was found at widely differing concentrations (ranging from 2. 80 mg/kg in muscle to 24. 80 mg/kg in liver). The chromatograph-ic method developed for this study provides a very simple and sen-sitive means for the simultaneous determination of embutramide and <b>mebezonium</b> <b>iodide,</b> the emetic concentrations of which were consistent with suicides reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Thirty Meleagris gallopavo {{heads with}} their neck {{segments}} were used. Animals were contained and euthanized with {{the association of}} <b>mebezonium</b> <b>iodide,</b> embutramide and tetracaine hydrochloride (T 61, Intervet) by intravenous injection. The arterial system was rinsed with cold saline solution (15 °C), with 5000 IU heparin and filled with red-colored latex. The samples were fixed in 20 % formaldehyde for seven days. The brains were removed with a segment of cervical spinal cord and after, the dura-mater was removed and the arteries dissected. The cerebral carotid arteries, after the intercarotid anastomosis, were projected around the hypophysis, {{until they reached the}} tuber cinereum and divided into their terminal branches, the caudal branch and the rostral branch. The rostral branch was projected rostrolateralwards and gave off, in sequence, two collateral branches, the caudal cerebral and the middle cerebral arteries and the terminal branch was as cerebroethmoidal artery. The caudal cerebral artery of one antimere formed the interhemispheric artery, which gave off dorsal hemispheric branches to the convex surface of both antimeres. Its dorsal tectal mesencephalic branch, of only one antimere, originated the dorsal cerebellar artery. In the interior of the cerebral transverse fissure, after the origin of the dorsal tectal mesencephalic artery, the caudal cerebral artery emitted occipital hemispheric branches, pineal branches and medial hemispheric branches, on both antimeres. The caudal cerebral artery's territory comprehended the entire surface of the dorsal hemioptic lobe, the rostral surface of the cerebellum, the diencephalic structures, the caudal pole and the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere and in the convex surface, the sagittal eminence except for its most rostral third. Due to the asymmetry found in the caudal cerebral arteries' ramifications, the models were classified into three types and their respective subtypes...|$|E
