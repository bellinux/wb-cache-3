5000|$|Richard Sander {{claims that}} artificially {{elevating}} minority students into schools they otherwise {{would not be}} capable of attending, discourages them and tends to engender failure and high dropout rates for these students. For example, about half of black college students rank in the bottom 20 percent of their classes, black law school graduates are four {{times as likely to}} fail bar exams as are whites, and interracial friendships are more likely to form among students with relatively similar levels of academic preparation; thus, blacks and Hispanics are more socially integrated on campuses where they are less academically mismatched. He claims that the supposed [...] "beneficiaries" [...] of affirmative action - minorities - do not actually benefit and rather are harmed by the policy. Sander's claims have been disputed, and his empirical analyses have been subject to substantial criticism. A group including some of the country's lead statistical methodologists told the Supreme Court that Sander's analyses were sufficiently flawed that the Court would be wise to ignore them entirely.

5000|$|Sander {{is known}} for his {{research}} on affirmative action, which claims that it actually causes more negatives than benefits for African American law students by hurting them due to the overly competitive environments in more prestigious schools, through what he calls the [...] "mismatch effect". He published his research in a 2004 article in Stanford Law Review where he claimed that if minority students had been admitted into less-competitive schools for which they would qualify for without affirmative action, they would have been more successful. He has also published studies suggesting that law firms' efforts to promote diversity sometimes led to them hiring underqualified black lawyers, leading to these lawyers being more likely than their better-credentialed white counterparts to leave the firm. His research is controversial and has been widely criticized, including by Ian Ayres and Richard Brooks. Ayres and Brooks published a study in 2005 finding that eliminating affirmative action would not increase the number of black lawyers by 7.9 percent, as Sander's study had claimed, but that it would instead reduce the number of lawyers by about 12.7 percent.

The <b>mismatch</b> <b>effect</b> due to the partial shading of a PV module can be limited thanks to the installation of both bypass and block diodes.

Specifically, we examined whether, relative to English monolinguals, German-English bilinguals would exhibit a bias to initially interpret English nouns ending in –er (e. g., partner) as referring to a male due to the association of masculine gender with this ending in German. This question was tested by recording bilinguals ' and monolinguals ' eye movements as they read English sentences containing a stereotypically male, female, or neutral –er noun that was an antecedent of a gendermatching or –mismatching reflexive.

Opponents of these policies argue that preferences are detrimental to minority students [...] that by placing these students in environments that are too competitive, affirmative action hurts their academic and career outcomes. This article examines the so-called "mismatch" hypothesis {{in the context of}} law school admissions. We discuss the existing scholarship on mismatch, identifying methodological limitations of earlier attempts to measure the effects of affirmative action. Using a simpler, more robust analytical strategy, we find that the data are inconsistent with large <b>mismatch</b> <b>effects,</b> particularly with respect to employment outcomes. While moderate <b>mismatch</b> <b>effects</b> are possible, they are concentrated among the students with the weakest entering academic credentials. To put our estimates in context, we simulate admissions under race-blind rules. Eliminating affirmative action would dramatically reduce the number of black law students, particularly at the most selective schools. Many potentially successful black law students would be excluded, far more than the number who would be induced to pass the bar exam by the elimination of <b>mismatch</b> <b>effects.</b> Accordingly, we find that eliminating affirmative action would dramatically reduce the production of black lawyers. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{analytical}} theory of flexible polymer chain dissolved {{in a good}} solvent, carrying permanent freely oriented dipoles on the monomers. We {{take into account the}} dipole correlations within the random phase approximation (RPA), as well as a dielectric heterogeneity in the internal polymer volume relative to the bulk solution. We demonstrate that the dipole correlations of monomers can be taken into account as pairwise ones only when the polymer chain is in a coil conformation. In this case the dipole correlations manifest themselves through the Keesom interactions of the permanent dipoles. On the other hand, the dielectric heterogeneity effect (dielectric <b>mismatch</b> <b>effect)</b> leads to effective interaction between the monomers of the polymeric coil. Both of these effects can be taken into account by the renormalizing the second virial coefficient of the volume interactions monomer-monomer. We establish that in the case when the solvent dielectric permittivity exceeds the dielectric permittivity of the polymeric material, the dielectric <b>mismatch</b> <b>effect</b> competes with the dipole attractive interactions, leading to polymer coil expansion. In the opposite case, both the dielectric <b>mismatch</b> <b>effect</b> and the dipole attractive interaction lead to the polymer coil collapse. We analyse the coil-globule transition caused by the dipole correlations of monomers within the many-body theory. We demonstrate that accounting for the dipole correlations higher than pairwise ones smooths this pure electrostatics driven coil-globule transition of the polymer chain.

In particular the polarization profile becomes asymmetrical, average polarization temperature dependence resembles the one in the external electric field, and there is possibility of external field screening by the internal one.

Online reading time results further support this hypothesis showing that mismatched antecedents induce disproportionately larger processing costs in contrastive topic structures as compared to simple focus structures, as evidenced by increased reading times in regions both preceding and following the ellipsis site.

40|$|Abstract—A time-interleaved A–D {{converter}} (ADC) {{system is}} {{an effective way to}} implement a high-sampling-rate ADC with relatively slow circuits. In the system, several channel ADCs operate at interleaved sampling times as if they were effectively a single ADC operating at a much higher sampling rate. However, mismatches such as offset, gain mismatches among channel ADCs as well as timing skew of the clocks distributed to them degrade S/N of the ADC system as a whole. This paper analyzes the channel mismatch effects in the time-interleaved ADC system. Previous analysis showed the effect for each mismatch individually,however in this paper we derive explicit formulas for the mismatch effects when all of offset, gain and timing mismatches exist together. We have clarified that the gain and timing mismatch effects interact with each other but the offset <b>mismatch</b> <b>effect</b> is independent from them, and this can be seen clearly in frequency domain.

There are findings which point {{in the direction of}} one-step models of language comprehension. However, as of yet it is unclear to what extent these reflect low-level associations. To investigate this possibility, we manipulated the polarity of the sentences. A negative sentence still includes the critical word but now describes a plausible situation and should thus not lead to comprehension difficulties unless these are based on low-level associations. In two phrasal self-paced reading studies, we found a <b>mismatch</b> <b>effect</b> independent of polarity early on in the sentence on the phrase involving the critical word and the following phrase. An interaction appeared only at the sentence end, reflecting the <b>mismatch</b> <b>effect</b> for affirmative but not for negated sentences on that phrase. These results suggest an early word-based effect. Readers seem not to fully integrate the meaning of a sentence and the extra-linguistic information about a speaker until the end of a sentence – which seem to fit well with two-step models of comprehension.

40|$|Policy makers {{agree that}} vacant houses are undesirable. Moreover the {{existence}} of empty houses is used as an argument for allocating less land for new construction. So higher vacancy rates tend to trigger tighter restrictions on the supply of land. Such tighter restrictions lead to higher prices and, because of the incentives this creates for occupying housing, to lower housing vacancies (?opportunity cost effect?). There is, however, a second effect ignored by planners: more restrictive planning policies impede the matching process in housing markets so leading to higher vacancies (?<b>mismatch</b> <b>effect?).</b> Which of these two forces dominates is an empirical question. This is our focus here. Addressing potential reverse causation and other endogeneity concerns, we use a unique panel data set on land use regulation for 350 Local Authorities in England from 1981 to 2011. Our results show that tighter local planning constraints increase local housing vacancy rates, suggesting that the <b>mismatch</b> <b>effect</b> dominates. A one standard deviation increase in local regulatory restrictiveness causes the average local vacancy rate to increase by about 0. 9 percentage points (23 percent).
