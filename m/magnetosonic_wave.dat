40|$|Abstract. The {{resonant}} {{absorption of}} slow and fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> in a nonuniform magnetic plasma is studied {{for a simple}} planar equilibrium model. Propagating slow and fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> are launched upwards in a lower uniform layer. They are partially absorbed by coupling to local resonant waves in an overlying nonuniform plasma layer at the magnetic surface where {{the frequency of the}} incoming wave equals the local Alfvén continuum frequency or the local slow continuum frequency. The slow <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> can only be coupled to resonant slow continuum waves. For the fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> there are three possibilities as they can be coupled to resonant Alfvén continuum waves alone, resonant Alfvén continuum waves combined with resonant slow continuum waves, and resonant slow continuum waves alone. The present paper focuses on the absorption of <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> by coupling to resonant slow continuum waves either alone or in combination with resonant Alfvén continuum waves. The results show that the resonant absorption of slow and fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> at the slow resonance position strongly depends on the characteristics of the equilibrium model and of the driving wave. The absorption can produce efficient local heating of plasma under conditions as in the solar atmosphere. Key words: Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) – methods: numerica...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{outstanding}} issues regarding the excitation of <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> has been the observational evidence that obliquely propagating waves are dominant at comets and planetary foreshocks despite the predictions of linear theory that maximum growth occurs at parallel propagation. To address this issue, we have conducted a detailed linear theory using a beam-ring distribution function. The results have shown that such distribution functions are associated with four separate instabilities. Two of these instabilities {{are similar to the}} right hand resonant ion/ion and the non-resonant instabilities which are also present {{in the case of a}} field aligned beam. The other two instabilities are associated with the presence of ring part of the distribution function. One of these instabilities excites <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> with maximum growth in the oblique directions. The other excites Alfven waves with maximum growth in the oblique directions. The importance of the former instability is that it may explain the oblique nature of the <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> observed at planetary foreshocks and comets. In order to understand the nonlinear properties of these various instabilities, we have also conducted 2 -D hybrid (particle ions, fluid electrons) simulations. We have found that when the beam density is sufficiently large so that the non-resonant instability has the largest growth rate, these waves dominate the initial wave power in the system. At later times, however, the obliquely propagating <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> become dominant. Another important finding was that when the two instabilities which excite <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> have the largest growth rates, the system is dominated by the obliquely propagating <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves.</b> This is despite the fact that the largest growth rate for one of the instabilities occurs in the parallel direction.

We examine here the influence of much lower frequency and highly oblique, fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> (also called ELF equatorial noise) by means of both approximate analytical formulations of the corresponding diffusion coefficients and full numerical simulations. Further analytical developments allow us to identify the most critical wave and plasma parameters necessary for a strong impact of fast <b>magnetosonic</b> <b>waves</b> on electron lifetimes and acceleration in the simultaneous presence of chorus, hiss, or lightning-generated waves, {{both inside and outside}} the plasmasphere.
