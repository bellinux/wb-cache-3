5|$|In stamp {{collecting}} circles, the word forerunner usually describes {{a postage stamp}} used during the time period before a region or territory issues stamps of its own. However, in Irish reference books, such as Handbook of Irish Philately, the term forerunners usually refers to political and propaganda labels. These often resemble stamps, but few of them were used on Irish mail {{and they had no}} legal standing for <b>mail</b> <b>in</b> Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Three final candidates, {{selected}} by a three-member BBWAA committee, were named on July 14, 2009 at Busch Stadium in St. Louis {{in conjunction with}} All-Star Game activities: Bill Madden, national baseball columnist for the New York Daily News, Bob Elliott of the Toronto Sun and Joe Giuliotti, retired from the Boston Herald. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to cast ballots in voting conducted by <b>mail</b> <b>in</b> November.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the many}} books written about him (Holroyd counts 80 by 1939) Shaw's autobiographical output, {{apart from his}} diaries, was {{relatively}} slight. He gave interviews to newspapers—"GBS Confesses", to The Daily <b>Mail</b> <b>in</b> 1904 is an example—and provided sketches to would-be biographers whose work was rejected by Shaw and never published. In 1939 Shaw drew on these materials to produce Shaw Gives Himself Away, a miscellany which, a year before his death, he revised and republished as Sixteen Self Sketches (there were seventeen). He {{made it clear to}} his publishers that this slim book was in no sense a full autobiography.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Abu-Jamal was punished with solitary {{confinement}} {{for engaging in}} entrepreneurship contrary to prison regulations. Subsequent to the airing of the 1996 HBO documentary , which included footage from visitation interviews conducted with him, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections acted to ban outsiders from using any recording equipment in state prisons. In litigation before the US Court of Appeals, in 1998 he successfully established his right to write for financial gain in prison. The same litigation also established that the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections had illegally opened his <b>mail</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to establish whether he was writing for financial gain.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell {{appeared}} on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno while on UCLA's campus, deliberately answering questions incorrectly. He {{appeared on}} A Dating Story, a reality television show, in May 2002. In the episode, Mitchell took Tiffany Schmid, {{a model in}} the Philadelphia area, to Great Adventure Amusement Park for their date. Mitchell, {{as well as several}} other NFL players, received threatening hate <b>mail</b> <b>in</b> 2003, apparently due to his appearance on the reality show with Schmid as a mixed-race couple at the time.|$|E

5|$|Sense and Sensibility was {{released}} on a two-disc DVD in the UK on 14 January 2008. All three episodes were given away free {{with a copy of}} the Daily <b>Mail</b> <b>in</b> 2009.

The two-disc set also included the BBC's Miss Austen Regrets, as well as commentary and interviews from the cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|Commercials {{instructed}} fans to <b>mail</b> <b>in</b> episodes' geographical destinations during sweeps week. Advertisements appeared through Time Warner's television channels, Sports Illustrated for Kids, DC Comics publications, radio stations, and Warner Brothers stores. The contest {{marked the}} first time that Cartoon Network U.S., TNT Europe, Cartoon Network Europe, Cartoon Network Asia, and Cartoon Network Latin America united for a single promotion. Turner encouraged local cable operators to submit their own spots, generating 34,000ads among 174cable systems for a total of $3.4million cross-channel media support. 50,000children with a median age of ten entered the competition, and 20,000answered correctly. Turner selected ten viewers from the United States and nine from Latin America and Asia as grand-prize winners. They and two-hundred others received Quest-themed adventure packs, including a backpack, flashlight and siren, travel journal, pen, T-shirt, and glow sticks. Cartoon Network aired the names of winning children on a special feature in which Jeremiah Surd issued personal threats.|$|E
5|$|During his term, Crittenden {{remained}} {{an outspoken critic}} of Jackson and his successor, Martin Van Buren. He supported Henry Clay's plan for distributing proceeds from the sale of public lands among the states, and also joined Clay in opposing the administration-backed Second Seminole War. One of the few administration proposals he supported was the recognition of the new Republic of Texas. During this period of Crittenden's service in the Senate, the issue of slavery rose to prominence. Crittenden was regarded as a moderate on the issue, seeking to keep it out of politics altogether. In 1836, he resisted petitions by the Quakers to abolish slavery in Washington, D.C., but he also opposed radical pro-slavery measures such as John C. Calhoun's proposal to ban abolitionist literature from being delivered by <b>mail</b> <b>in</b> the Southern states.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the deaths}} of two further partners, Backhouse in 1879 and Turnbull in 1880, Storey bought their shares to become the Echos chief proprietor. A year later, in 1881, he met Scottish-born millionaire Andrew Carnegie, and formed a {{syndicate}} with him to set up new newspapers and buy up others. Among those purchased were the Wolverhampton Express and Star, the Northern Daily <b>Mail</b> <b>in</b> Hartlepool and the Portsmouth Evening News. An attempt to buy the Shields Gazette, the country's oldest daily newspaper, failed. The syndicate finally broke up in 1885, with Storey retaining control of the Echo, Hampshire Telegraph, Portsmouth News and the Northern Daily Mail. These papers {{formed the basis of}} a new company, Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd, formed in the 1930s. The 19th century ended with the rivalry between the Echo and the Sunderland Daily Post intensifying. The Silksworth Colliery strike of 1891 pitted the two papers against each other, with the Post attacking Storey for having exploited the strike for political gain. Storey successfully sued for libel.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the field}} seasons of 1924 and 1925, Wheeler ran {{excavations}} of the Roman fort of Y Gaer near Brecon, a project aided {{by his wife}} and two archaeological students, Nowell Myres and Christopher Hawkes. During this project, he was visited by the prominent Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie and his wife Hilda Petrie; Wheeler greatly admired Petrie's emphasis on strong archaeological methodologies. Wheeler published the results of his excavation in The Roman Fort Near Brecon. He then began excavations at Isca Augusta, a Roman site in Caerleon, where he focused on revealing the Roman amphitheatre. Intent on attracting press attention to both raise public awareness of archaeology and attract new sources of funding, he contacted the press and organised a sponsorship of the excavation by the middle-market newspaper the Daily <b>Mail.</b> <b>In</b> doing so, he emphasised the folkloric and legendary associations that the site had with King Arthur. In 1925, Oxford University Press published Wheeler's first book for a general audience, Prehistoric and Roman Wales; he later expressed the opinion {{that it was not a}} good book.|$|E
5|$|The {{reported}} overall {{sales figures}} of the A Song of Ice and Fire series vary. The New Yorker said in April 2011 (before the publication of A Dance with Dragons) that more than 15million Ice and Fire books had been sold worldwide, a figure repeated by The Globe and <b>Mail</b> <b>in</b> July 2011. Reuters reported in September 2013 that the books including print, digital and audio versions have sold more than 24million copies in North America. The Wall Street Journal reported more than six million sold copies in North America by May 2011. USA Today reported 8.5million copies in print and digital overall in July 2011, and over 12million sold copies in print in December 2011. The series has been translated into more than 20 languages; USA Today reported the fifth book to be translated into over 40 languages. Forbes estimated that Martin was the 12th highest-earning author worldwide in 2011 at $15million.|$|E

5|$|The group {{intentionally}} avoids {{any area}} where crime rates {{could result in}} frequent law enforcement interventions and commandos are instructed to be polite and are warned {{to stay away from}} illegal activities; association or deals with criminal organizations are prohibited. In keeping a discipline code, the organization also discourages the use of alcohol and prohibits the use of drugs. The EPB attempts to stay away from areas where other nationalist groups are based in order to avoid attention. There also settle away from military of police stations. Meetings are generally held in places with good reputation and in buildings that offer several access points, with heavy precautions being taken to reach their locations untailed. If different units are meeting, commandoes are instructed to place hoods or masks and use codenames in order to protect their identities, both to accomplish plausible denial and to root out any law enforcement plant. Information is segregated between groups and only shared in limited detail, when necessary. Incriminating or detailed documents or any other evidence is to be destroyed once the potential of a law enforcement intervention is apparent. While involved in a particular mission, the EPB commandoes regularly assume a faux name, but they usually use this to acquire legitimate documents and select a nondescript address in which to receive <b>mail</b> <b>in</b> a fashion that prevents surveillance, such a P.O. Box or an decoy address where mail is delivered to the community in general. Even ammunitions were given codes such as Manteca for firearms or Libretas for explosives to conceal their nature. Armories were specifically retrofitted to preserve the condition and to prepare new ammunition as needed. Funds are managed strictly and reports are constant in order to keep a balanced budget.|$|E

For Equation (2), we restricted the coefficients of the exhaustive set of MM indicators to sum {{to zero in}} order to avoid exact collinearity. This normalization means that the coefficient for each MM indicator is the predicted impact of Ticket <b>mailing</b> <b>in</b> that MM relative to mailing on the average MM during the rollout period (approximately 6.4 for both samples) (Suits 1984).
