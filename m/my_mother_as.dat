500|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] FT Magazines Rosie Millard, Hedren discussed Hitchcock's attitude towards her after {{she decided not to}} work for him again: [...] "He did ruin my career. He kept me under contract, paid me to do nothing for close on two years." [...] Hitchcock sold her contract to Universal Studios, which dismissed her when she refused to work on one of its television shows. However, her acting career continued and she appeared in a number of film and television productions. Hedren said that while she was still under contract to Hitchcock, he turned down several film roles on her behalf, and was particularly disappointed when she heard from French director François Truffaut that he had wanted her for his film Fahrenheit 451. Truffaut's daughter Laura disputed this, telling Tony Lee Moral her mother had expressed surprise at the mention of Hedren's possible involvement in the project. Laura Truffaut was also sceptical of the story. [...] "It is extremely unlikely in my view that my father seriously entertained this project without sharing it with <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>as</b> he was not secretive about the other actors who were considered for casting." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 1995 memoir Dreams from My Father, Barack Obama {{mentioned}} Frank, {{a friend}} in Hawaii of his maternal grandfather Stanley Dunham; Obama later identified the man as Davis. Obama said Davis recounted that he and Stanley Dunham had grown up 50 miles apart in Kansas, near Wichita, although they did not meet until living in Hawaii. Davis described the way Kansas race relations were back then, including Jim Crow restrictions, and his belief {{that there had been}} little progress since then. As Obama remembered, [...] "It made me smile, thinking back on Frank and his old Black Power, dashiki self. In some ways he was as incurable as <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>as</b> certain in his faith, living in the same sixties time warp that Hawaii had created." [...] Obama also remembered Frank Davis later in life after taking a job in South Chicago as a community organizer. One day Obama visited areas where Davis had lived, writing, [...] "I imagined Frank in a baggy suit and wide lapels, {{standing in front of the}} old Regal Theatre, waiting to see Duke or Ella emerge from a gig." ...|$|E
