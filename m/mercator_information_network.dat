40|$|Clustering {{analysis}} {{is a basic}} and essential method for mining heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks,</b> which consist of multiple types of objects and rich semantic relations among different object types. Heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> are ubiquitous in the real-world applications, such as bibliographic networks and social media networks. Unfortunately, most existing approaches, such as spectral clustering, are designed to analyze homogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks,</b> which are composed of only one type of objects and links. Some recent studies focused on heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> and yielded some research fruits, such as RankClus and NetClus. However, they often assumed that the heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> usually follow some simple schemas, such as bityped network schema or star network schema. To overcome the above limitations, we model the heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>network</b> as a tensor without the restriction of network schema. Then, a tensor CP decomposition method is adapted to formulate the clustering problem in heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks.</b> Further, we develop two stochastic gradient descent algorithms, namely, SGDClus and SOSClus, which lead to effective clustering multityped objects simultaneously. The experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world dataset have demonstrated that our proposed clustering framework can model heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> efficiently and outperform state-of-the-art clustering methods...|$|R

40|$|With the {{ubiquity of}} <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> and their broad applications, the issue of {{similarity}} computation between entities of an <b>information</b> <b>network</b> arises and draws extensive research interests. However, to effectively and comprehensively measure “how similar two entities are within an information network” is nontrivial, and the problem becomes even more challenging when the <b>information</b> <b>network</b> to be examined is massive and diverse. In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure, P-Rank (Penetrating Rank), toward effectively computing the structural similarities of entities in real <b>information</b> <b>networks.</b> P-Rank enriches the well-known similarity measure, SimRank, by jointly encoding both in- and out-link relationships into structural similarity computation. P-Rank is {{proven to be a}} unified structural similarity framework, under which all state-of-the-art similarity measures, including CoCitation, Coupling, Amsler and SimRank, are just its special cases. Based on its recursive nature of P-Rank, we propose a fixed point algorithm to reinforce structural similarity of vertex pairs beyond the localized neighborhood scope toward the entire <b>information</b> <b>network.</b> Our experimental studies demonstrate the power of P-Rank as an effective similarity measure in different <b>information</b> <b>networks.</b> Meanwhile, under the same time/space complexity, P-Rank outperforms SimRank as a comprehensive and more meaningful structural similarity measure, especially in large real <b>information</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

Departing from both, we view interconnected, semi-structured datasets as heterogeneous, information-rich networks and study how to uncover hidden knowledge in such networks. For example, a university database {{can be viewed as a}} heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>network,</b> where objects of multiple types, such as students, professors, courses, departments, and multiple typed relationships, such as teach and advise are intertwined together, providing abundant information. In this tutorial, we present an organized picture on mining heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> and introduce a set of interesting, effective and scalable network mining methods. The topics to be covered include (i) database as an <b>information</b> <b>network,</b> (ii) mining <b>information</b> networks: clustering, classification, ranking, similarity search, and meta path-guided analysis, (iii) construction of quality, informative networks by data mining, (iv) trend and evolution analysis in heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks,</b> and (v) research frontiers.
