50|$|The {{three species}} of <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons</b> (Goura) - the western <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Goura cristata), the {{southern}} <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Goura scheepmakeri) and the Victoria <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Goura victoria) - {{are the largest}} extant pigeons (Columbidae). The three <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons</b> are alike and replace each other geographically. The genus was described by James Francis Stephens in 1819.|$|R
50|$|The Victoria <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{is a deep}} blue-gray {{color with}} a small, black mask. Its feather crest (the {{signature}} feature of <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons</b> other than their size) is conspicuously white-tipped. On the wing coverts is a row of feathers that are a paler blue-gray with maroon tips. These form a distinct wing bar. The chest is a deep purple-maroon color. As in all <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons,</b> melanism has been observed. The other two <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons</b> are somewhat superficially similar, but only the western <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> overlaps in range with the Victoria species. The southern <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> does not. In the western species, the crown is more scraggly and hair-like, the chest is a uniform blue-gray and not maroon, and a less distinct wing-bar is present. Both sexes are similar.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with its}} close and very similar-looking {{relatives}} the Victoria <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{and the southern}} <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon,</b> {{it is one of}} the largest and is considered one of the most beautiful members of the pigeon family. The western <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> is found in and is endemic to the lowland rainforests of Papua, Indonesia section of New Guinea; the other species of <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> inhabit different regions of the island. The diet consists mainly of fruits and seeds.|$|R
50|$|The western <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon,</b> {{also known}} as the common <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> or blue <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Goura cristata) is a large, blue-grey pigeon with blue lacy crests over the head and dark blue mask {{feathers}} around its eyes. Both sexes are almost similar but males are often larger than females. It is on average 70 cm (28 in) long and weighs 2,100 grams (4.6 lbs).|$|R

50|$|Like other <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons,</b> {{this species}} makes a loud {{clapping}} sound when it takes flight. The mating calls {{of this species}} are also similar {{to the other two}} species of <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons,</b> consisting of a deep hoota-hoota-hoota-hoota-hoota sound. When defending their territories, these birds make a resounding whup-up, whup-up, whup-up call. Their contact call is a deep, muffled, and rather human-like ummm or hmmm.|$|R

5000|$|The western <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> is the {{official}} provincial bird of West Papua, and it appears on its coat of arms.|$|R
50|$|The western <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name Columba cristata.|$|R
5000|$|The {{video game}} {{spin-off}} Angry Birds Stella has a western <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> named Willow, {{who wears a}} striped hat to conceal her crest.|$|R
50|$|The Victoria <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> is now {{the most}} rarely {{occurring}} of the three <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> species in the wild, although {{it is the most}} widely kept species in captivity. Perhaps the most pressing threat to the species is continuing habitat loss due to logging. It now quite uncommon near human habitations because it is heavily hunted around them, particularly in areas where gun possession is prevalent. It can be quite tame and easily shot, though now seems to be fearful of humans in the wild. Most hunting is for its plumes and meat. Trapping of pigeons to be kept alive for captive collections is now illegal, but is still likely to be occurring. The Victoria <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> is evaluated as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed in Appendix II of CITES.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{subspecies}} of {{the southern}} <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon,</b> differentiated by their shoulder and belly colorations. Goura scheepmakeri sclateri of southwest New Guinea with maroon shoulders and blue-grey belly, and the nominate race Goura scheepmakeri scheepmakeri of southeast New Guinea with blue-grey shoulders and maroon below. It also looks very similar to its relatives, the Victoria <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon,</b> and the western crowned pigeon.This species was first discovered new to science by Otto Finsch who found a live bird received from the dealer C. Scheepmaker in Amsterdam Zoo and named it after him.|$|R
5000|$|Common fauna species {{include the}} agile wallaby, Pesquet's parrot, {{southern}} cassowary, blue <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon,</b> greater bird of paradise, king bird of paradise, red bird of paradise, New Guinea crocodile, and saltwater crocodile.|$|R
50|$|The {{phylogeny}} of the <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons</b> is {{not well}} resolved. Several molecular analyses have been conducted (e.g. Johnson &, 2000), with one (Shapiro et al., 2002) suggesting that along with the Nicobar pigeon and the tooth-billed pigeon of Samoa, the three Goura pigeons belong {{to a group of}} which the unfortunate dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire are an offshoot lineage, but depending on which genetic sequence is analyzed, the placement of the <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons</b> differs. They might belong to the fruit-dove subfamily Treroninae, but usually they are treated as a subfamily of their own, the Gourinae.|$|R
50|$|Being tame {{and heavily}} hunted for its meat and plumes, the {{southern}} <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It {{is listed in}} Appendix II of CITES.|$|R
50|$|Surrounding {{swamps and}} {{rainforest}} lowlands {{are of interest}} to birdwatchers, with a high chance of observing <b>Crowned</b> <b>Pigeon,</b> Yellow-eyed Starling, Large Fig-Parrot and Flame Bowerbird {{as well as a}} large variety of more common species.|$|R
50|$|Other animals {{exhibited}} in the walk-through area include Asian elephant, American flamingo, collared peccary, black-capped squirrel monkey, Indian flying fox, alpaca, Indian peafowl, pygmy goat, African pied crow, tufted capuchin, screamer, violet turaco, Victoria <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon,</b> and laughing kookaburra.|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons,</b> the Victoria <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> is a gregarious species. They usually {{travel in}} pairs or small parties as they search for food. They walk with an unhurried gait along the forest floor. Their food {{typically}} consists of fallen fruit. Birds {{of this species}} in captivity are particularly fond of eating figs. Seeds and invertebrates may occasionally supplement the diet. When disturbed, these birds fly straight up into the canopy or a large horizontal branch of a large forest tree. After being disturbed, they may remain on their perch for a considerable time engaging in contact calls and flicking their tails. In the wild, this species tends to be shier than the western <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon,</b> but can still occasionally be quietly approached. The males regularly engage in aggressive displays to establish dominance. In these interactions, the pigeons puff up their chests and repeatedly raise their wings as if preparing to strike their opponent. They also make short dashes {{at each other and}} may actually hit one another, but rarely make contact and can be completely peaceful towards other males outside of the early mating season.|$|R
50|$|Diergaarde Blijdorp {{participates in}} about 70 {{breeding}} programs and studbooks, and coordinates {{a number of}} these, including the international breeding program for red pandas, EEPs for Asian elephant, Komodo dragon, red-crowned and Siberian crane, Visayan warty pig and Egyptian tortoise, and the ESB for the <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons.</b>|$|R

50|$|Hunted {{for food}} and its plumes, it remains common only in remote areas. Due to ongoing habitat loss, limited range and {{overhunting}} in some areas, the western <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
