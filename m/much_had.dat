5|$|The {{tower and}} transepts were {{restored}} 1878–80 {{with a short}} spire similar to the original, but slated rather than oak-shingled. This work was done by Roderick Williams. The pulpit dates from this time. William Morris, {{on behalf of the}} Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, wrote to the vicar in 1877 asking for a less severe restoration. Unfortunately <b>much</b> <b>had</b> already been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Nine years earlier, Tchaikovsky had penned a {{ruthless}} dissection of The Five for Nadezhda von Meck. At that time, his feelings of personal isolation and professional insecurity {{had been at}} their strongest. In the nine intervening years, Mussorgsky and Borodin had both died, Balakirev had banished himself to the musical sidelines, and Cui's critical missives had lost much of their sting for Tchaikovsky. Rimsky-Korsakov {{was the only one}} left who was fully active as a composer, and <b>much</b> <b>had</b> changed in the intervening years between him and Tchaikovsky as a result of Rimsky-Korsakov's change in musical values. Tchaikovsky had also changed. More secure as a composer and less isolated personally than {{he had been in the}} past, Tchaikovsky enjoyed the company he now kept with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov, and found much to enjoy in their music.|$|E
5|$|Not <b>much</b> <b>had</b> {{changed by}} the 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45am. After a {{prisoner}} count, they moved into the yard until 7:30, when they collected breakfast {{and headed back to}} their cells. The 8:00 bell signaled a parade, and then the start of work, which lasted until 11:15. They ate a meal, locked in their cells until 12:20pm, followed by some time in the yards. At 1:00 there was another parade, and another session of work which lasted to 4:15. Another meal was collected, and prisoners were locked away in their cells overnight. The lights stayed on until 9:30pm. On the weekends the routine featured no work, and included a film played for the prisoners.|$|E

25|$|Ahead of the 2009 {{elections}} for Congress, Michetti's name was frequently {{mentioned as a}} likely candidate for National Deputy, despite serving {{less than two years}} in municipal government. By April, her candidature appeared less likely given the manoeuvres of all the main parties. <b>Much</b> <b>had</b> also been made of her friendship with the leader of the rival Civic Coalition, Elisa Carrió. However, on 20 April Michetti resigned as Deputy Head of Government and confirmed that she would lead the PRO list for Buenos Aires for national deputies.|$|E
25|$|A Clockwork Orange {{was written}} in Hove, then a senescent seaside town. Burgess had arrived back in Britain after his stint abroad to see that <b>much</b> <b>had</b> changed. A youth culture had grown, {{including}} coffee bars, pop music and teenage gangs. England was gripped by fears over juvenile delinquency. Burgess claimed that the novel's inspiration was his first wife Lynne's beating by a gang of drunk American servicemen stationed in England during World War II. She subsequently miscarried. In its investigation of free will, the book's target is ostensibly the concept of behaviourism, pioneered by such figures as B. F. Skinner.|$|E

25|$|In 1899, the regiment's {{years of}} peace {{ended with the}} start of the Second Anglo-Boer War. That year, the Scots Greys, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant-Colonel Hon. W.P. Alexander, were ordered to Cape Town to join the Cavalry Division being formed. In the years since Balaclava, <b>much</b> <b>had</b> changed about warfare. Gone were the red coats and bearskin shakos. The Scots Greys would now fight wearing khaki. In fact, with the popularity of wearing khaki that accompanied {{the start of the}} Boer War, the Scots Greys {{went so far as to}} dye their grey mounts khaki to help them blend in with the veldt.|$|E
25|$|By 1960, {{changes were}} in place, {{but in one}} respect, nothing <b>much</b> <b>had</b> happened. Desegregation was still only tolerated, not embraced, by the general public. Lowe saw the first racial changes from his {{position}} as president {{and chairman of the}} Cotton Bowl Athletic Association. By the early 1960s, he was {{on the board of the}} Salesmanship Club, and by 1965, he was president of the Salesmanship Club and a member of the Citizens Council. In 1968, he was entrusted with leadership of the Greater Dallas Council of Churches and then the Community Relations Commission, both of which pushed him into the center of local race relations.|$|E
25|$|The Allies {{staggered}} {{into their}} base at Ciudad Rodrigo on 19 November. Two-fifths of the army's soldiers were either ill or missing. The humor of {{the rank and}} file was not improved when Wellington issued a nasty letter to his division and brigade commanders and it was leaked to the press. A total of 5,000 men were missing. While many of the missing were on the way to French prison camps, the majority had died from starvation or hypothermia. Though the Allied army had apparently been defeated, in fact <b>much</b> <b>had</b> been accomplished in 1812. The French had been ejected from the cities of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Seville, and Astorga, and the provinces of Andalusia, Extremadura, and Asturias.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, Velasquez {{decided to}} adopt a new {{organizing}} strategy. The union believed that Ohio tomato growers {{would be unable to}} recruit enough workers to see them through a long strike. So that year 2,000 FLOC members walked off their jobs in Ohio. While some growers were willing to negotiate, big canners such as the Campbell Soup Company were unwilling to pay the higher prices which would accompany a unionized workforce. FLOC initiated a boycott of Campbell's. Six years later, not <b>much</b> <b>had</b> changed even though FLOC had conducted a well-publicized 560-mile march from Toledo to Campbell Soup headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, in 1983. Even the support of the National Council of Churches and a group of Catholic bishops in Ohio failed to sway the company.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to those numbers being far apart, <b>much</b> <b>had</b> changed since the 2004 deal expired. The Hiawatha Light Rail (later Blue Line) had opened and become a huge success. Funding for the Northstar commuter rail line had been approved. As anticipated, these two lines would eventually converge on {{the northwest corner of}} the Rapid Park Site, now the likely location for a future multi-modal transportation hub. The site itself had been rezoned in 2005, allowing its development into high end commercial and residential space. Land Partners II had entered into a development agreement with Hines Corporation for this purpose, as a backup in the event that the land was not chosen as home for the Twins. Given the scarcity of land available in downtown Minneapolis, the land owners had multiple reasons to believe that the land’s value had, in fact, increased substantially since 2004, with or without a ballpark.|$|E
25|$|During Reconstruction, {{the state}} {{legislature}} mobilized to provide for public need more than had previous governments: establishing public schools and investing in infrastructure, as well as charitable institutions such as hospitals and asylums. The needed to increase taxes which were abnormally low. The planters had provided privately for their own needs. There was some fraudulent spending in the postwar years; a collapse in state credit because of huge deficits, forced the states to increase property tax rates. In places, the rate went up to ten times higher—despite the poverty of the region. The planters had not invested in infrastructure and <b>much</b> <b>had</b> been destroyed during the war. In part, the new tax system was designed to force owners of large plantations with huge tracts of uncultivated land either to sell or to have it confiscated for failure to pay taxes. The taxes {{would serve as a}} market-based system for redistributing the land to the landless freedmen and white poor. Mississippi, for instance, was mostly frontier, with 90% of the bottomlands in the interior undeveloped.|$|E

25|$|That same year, a {{corporate}} campaign {{run by the}} Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC), AFL-CIO, ended a six-year strike and boycott and won the union its first contract. In 1978, 2,000 FLOC members walked off their jobs in the Midwest. While some growers were willing to negotiate, big canners such as the Campbell Soup Company were unwilling to pay the higher prices which would accompany a unionized workforce. FLOC initiated a boycott of Campbell's. Six years later, not <b>much</b> <b>had</b> changed. In 1984, FLOC asked Ray Rogers (who had left ACWA and founded a consulting firm that helped unions run comprehensive campaigns) for help. Rogers developed a comprehensive campaign strategy which included a well-publicized demonstration at a Campbell Soup shareholder meeting and targeted three members of Campbell's board of directors for economic pressure. In February 1986, Campbell and its growers recognized FLOC as the workers' representative and signed a collective bargaining agreement which provided for wage increases, grievance resolution, insurance, and committees to study pesticide safety, housing, health care, and day care issues. Shortly thereafter, FLOC reached deals with Vlasic, Heinz, Green Bay Foods (now part of Dean Foods), Aunt Jane's (now part of Dean Foods) and Dean Foods.|$|E
