5|$|In 1910, {{the palace}} was stormed during the <b>Monegasque</b> Revolution. The prince {{pronounced}} {{an end to}} absolute monarchy by promulgating a constitution with an elected parliament the following year.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{while other}} European sovereigns were {{building}} luxurious, modern Renaissance and Baroque palaces, politics {{and common sense}} demanded that the palace of the <b>Monegasque</b> rulers be fortified. This unique requirement, at such a late stage in history, has made the palace at Monaco {{one of the most}} unusual in Europe. Indeed, when its fortifications were finally relaxed during the late 18th century, it was seized by the French and stripped of its treasures, and fell into decline, while the Grimaldi were exiled for over 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Antoine's {{marriage}} to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne {{to members of}} the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the <b>Monégasque</b> constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.|$|E

5|$|Bird's feature race {{victory was}} his—and Russian Time's—second {{of the season}} and Coletti's sprint race win meant he became the first <b>Monegasque</b> driver to win on the streets of Monaco since Louis Chiron in 1931. The race results {{resulted}} in Coletti increasing his lead {{at the top of the}} Drivers' Championship to 24 points ahead of Felipe Nasr. Bird's feature race win meant he gained two positions to move into third while Leimer dropped to fourth. Rapax took over the lead of the Teams' Championship from Carlin and Russian Time's strong results enabled the company to take over third place. Racing Engineering rounded out the top four with seven rounds left in the season.|$|E
25|$|There is {{precedent}} for a <b>Monégasque</b> prince to adopt his own illegitimate child and thereby place that {{child at the}} head of the line of succession to the <b>Monegasque</b> throne, as was done for Caroline's grandmother, Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois. However, because of changes to the constitution of Monaco in 2002, this was no longer an option.|$|E

25|$|The {{first part}} of Prince Albert II's enthronement as ruler of the Principality was on 12 July 2005, {{after the end of}} the three-month {{mourning}} period for his father. A morning Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral presided over by the Archbishop of Monaco, the Most Reverend Bernard Barsi, formally marked the beginning of his reign. Afterward Albert II returned to the princely palace to host a garden party for 7,000 <b>Monégasques</b> born in the principality. In the courtyard, the Prince was presented with two keys of the city as a symbol of his investiture. The evening ended with a spectacular fireworks display on the waterfront.|$|R

500|$|Jean II was {{succeeded by}} his brother Lucien I. Peace did not reign in Monaco for long; in December 1506 14,000 Genoese troops besieged Monaco and its castle, and for five months 1,500 <b>Monégasques</b> and mercenaries defended the Rocher before {{achieving}} victory in March 1507. This left Lucien I to walk a diplomatic tightrope between France and Spain {{in order to preserve}} the fragile independence of the tiny state which was in truth subject to Spain. Lucien immediately set about repairing the ravages of war to the fortified palace which had been damaged by heavy bombardment. To the main wing (see Illustrations 3 & 7 – H to M [...] ), built by Prince Lambert and extended during the reign of Jean II, he now added a large wing (H to C) which today houses the state apartments.|$|R
5|$|Honoré IV died {{shortly after}} his throne was {{restored}} to him, and structural restoration of the palace began under Honoré V and was continued {{after his death in}} 1841 by his brother Prince Florestan. However, by the time of Florestan's accession, Monaco was once again experiencing political tensions caused by financial problems. These resulted from its position as a protectorate of Sardinia, the country to which it had been ceded by France following the end of the Napoleonic wars. Florestan, an eccentric (he had been a professional actor), left the running of Monaco to his wife, Maria Caroline Gibert de Lametz. Despite her attempts to rule, her husband's people were once again in revolt. In an attempt to ease the volatile situation Florestan ceded power to his son Charles, but this came too late to appease the <b>Monégasques.</b> Menton and Roquebrune broke away from Monaco, leaving the Grimaldi's already small country hugely diminished—little more than Monte Carlo.|$|R
25|$|He married civilly on 19 March and religiously on 20 March 1920, in Monaco, Princess Charlotte of Monaco, the illegitimate but adopted {{daughter}} of Louis II of Monaco by Marie Juliette Louvet. Pierre de Polignac, {{member of a}} cadet branch of one of France's most renowned ducal families, noble {{since at least the}} 12th century, duke in 1780, peer in 1817, and a descendant of Marie Antoinette's favourite, Yolande de Polastron, duchesse de Polignac), he changed his name and coat of arms to those borne by the House of Grimaldi by <b>Monegasque</b> ordinance issued on 18 March 1920 the day before his wedding. He had become a subject of the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, also by <b>Monegasque</b> ordinance, on 29 February 1920. From the date of the religious wedding the court of Monaco referred to him, jure uxoris, as Duke of Valentinois. That title had been conferred upon his wife as heiress presumptive on 20 May 1919. His surname and arms were altered by <b>Monegasque</b> ordinance shortly after he became a <b>Monegasque</b> citizen to ensure that his dynastic issue would bear the surname of Grimaldi in compliance with Article I of Monaco's house law). Pierre remained in succession to the French title of Duke of Polignac, as do his legitimate male-line descendants.|$|E
25|$|Rumours arose {{surrounding}} the participation and return of San Marino and Monaco. Télé Monte Carlo (TMC), the <b>Monegasque</b> broadcaster, confirmed {{that there were}} talks with the EBU over a <b>Monegasque</b> return to the 2009 contest. At the same time, rumours spread that San Marino's broadcaster, Radiotelevisione della Repubblica di San Marino (SMRTV), would withdraw from the contest due to poor placing at the 2008 contest. In the end, after originally confirming their intent to participate in Moscow, SMRTV was forced {{to withdraw from the}} event due to financial difficulties that prevented a second entry.|$|E
25|$|Monaco has an open {{border with}} France. Schengen laws are {{administered}} {{as if it}} was part of EU, and Schengen visas are accepted. Both French and <b>Monégasque</b> authorities carry out checks at Monaco's seaport and heliport.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} Spanish peseta, the French franc {{was also a}} de facto {{currency}} used in Andorra (which had no national currency with legal tender). It circulated alongside the <b>Monegasque</b> franc, {{as it did in}} Monaco, with which it had equal value. These currencies were all replaced by the euro in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Following her mother's {{death in}} 1982, Caroline served as de facto {{first lady of}} Monaco until her brother married Charlene Wittstock in 2011. She {{regularly}} attends important social events in Monaco related to the <b>Monegasque</b> Princely Family, such as the National Day celebrations, the annual Rose Ball, the Red Cross Ball and the Formula One competition Monaco Grand Prix.|$|E
25|$|The {{countries}} that use francs include Switzerland, Liechtenstein, {{and most of}} Francophone Africa. Before {{the introduction of the}} euro, francs were also used in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, while Andorra and Monaco accepted the French franc as legal tender (<b>Monegasque</b> franc). The franc was also used within the French Empire's colonies, including Algeria and Cambodia. The franc is sometimes Italianised or Hispanicised as the franco, for instance in Luccan franco.|$|E
25|$|The {{town was}} sacked in 1338 by French, Genoese and <b>Monegasque</b> ships (under Charles Grimaldi, {{who used the}} plunder to help found the principality of Monaco). On visiting Southampton in 1339, Edward III ordered that walls be built to 'close the town'. The {{extensive}} rebuilding—part of the walls dates from 1175—culminated in {{the completion of the}} western walls in 1380. Roughly half of the walls, 13 of the original towers, and six gates survive.|$|E
25|$|In December 2010 Prince Albert II of Monaco {{bestowed}} <b>Monegasque</b> {{citizenship to}} Wynn, an unusual act since Wynn had {{never lived in}} Monaco and therefore didn't meet the prerequisites. According to the Las Vegas Sun, Wynn was given the citizenship when he agreed to serve as outside director in the Monaco QD International Hotels and Resorts Management, which is {{a joint venture between}} the governments of Monaco and Qatar. The organization buys and manages hotels in Europe, the Middle East and North America.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, the <b>Monégasque</b> court officially {{notified}} France of Caroline's contemplated {{marriage to}} Prince Ernst August and received assurance {{that there was}} no objection, in compliance with Article 2 of the 1918 Franco-Monégasque Treaty. Despite obtaining the official approval of the governments of France, Monaco and the United Kingdom, upon Caroline's marriage to Ernst August he forfeited his own place in Britain's order of succession. He is also subject to the Act of Settlement 1701, which imposes that consequence upon British dynasts who marry Roman Catholics.|$|E
25|$|The {{area where}} Occitan was {{historically}} dominant has approximately 16 million inhabitants. Recent {{research has shown}} it may be spoken as a first language by approximately 789,000 people in France, Italy, Spain and Monaco. In Monaco, Occitan coexists with <b>Monégasque</b> Ligurian, which is the other native language. Some researchers state that up to seven million people in France understand the language, whereas twelve to fourteen million fully spoke it in 1921. In 1860, Occitan speakers represented more than 39% of the whole French population (52% for francophones proper); they were still 26% to 36% in the 1920s and fewer than 7% in 1993.|$|E
25|$|On 2 April 2002, Monaco promulgated Princely Law 1.249, which {{provides}} {{that if a}} reigning prince dies without surviving legitimate issue, the throne passes to his legitimate siblings and their legitimate descendants of both sexes, according {{to the principle of}} male-preference primogeniture. Following Albert's accession, this law took full effect when ratified by France, pursuant to the Franco-Monégasque Treaty regulating relations between the Principality of Monaco and its neighbor. Prince Albert's sisters and their legitimate children thereby retained the right to inherit the <b>Monegasque</b> throne, which they would have otherwise lost upon the death of Prince Rainier.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the current}} {{constitution}} neither Jazmin Rotolo nor Alexandre Coste {{are in the}} line of succession as they are not Prince Albert's legitimate children, and he emphasized their ineligibility to inherit the throne in statements confirming his paternity. <b>Monegasque</b> law stipulates that any non-adulterine child is legitimised by the eventual marriage of his/her parents, thereupon obtaining the rights to which that child would have been entitled if born in lawful marriage. Thus Alexandre would have become Monaco's heir apparent under current law if Albert were to marry his son's mother. But in a 2005 exchange with American reporter Larry King, Albert stated that this would not happen.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, {{upon his}} 21st birthday, Rainier's mother renounced {{her right to}} the <b>Monegasque</b> throne and Rainier became Prince Louis's direct heir. In World War II Rainier joined the Free French Army in September 1944, and serving under General de Monsabert as a second lieutenant, and seeing action during the German counter-offensive in Alsace. He {{received}} the French Croix de Guerre with bronze star (representing a brigade level citation) and was given the rank of Chevalier in the French Legion of Honor in 1947. Following his decommission from the French Army, he was promoted by the French government as a captain in April 1949 and a colonel in December 1954.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Princess Caroline was {{appointed}} by her father {{as the president of}} the <b>Monegasque</b> Committee for the International Year of the Child. Two years later, in 1981, she founded her own foundation Jeune J'écoute. Other philanthropic organizations Caroline has been involved with include the World Association of Children's Friends (AMADE), the Princess Grace Foundation, the Prince Pierre Foundation, the Peter Le Marchant Trust and UNICEF. Her other patronages include the International School of Paris, Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, which she also founded, the Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Association des Guides et Scouts de Monaco, the Monte Carlo Garden Club and The Spring Arts Festival.|$|E
25|$|Rainier {{established}} a postal museum in 1950: the Museum of Stamps and Coins, in Monaco's Fontvieille district {{by using the}} collections of the <b>Monegasque</b> princes Albert I and Louis II. The prestigious philatelic collectors club Club de Monte-Carlo de l'Élite de la Philatélie was established under his patronage in 1999; the club has its headquarters at the museum, with its membership restricted to institutions and one hundred prestigious collectors. Rainier organized exhibitions of rare and exceptional postage stamps and letters with the club's members. Throughout his reign, Rainier surveyed all the process of creation of Monaco stamps. He liked stamps printed in intaglio {{and the art of}} engravers Henri Cheffer and Czesław Słania.|$|E
25|$|Rainier {{was born}} at Prince's Palace in Monaco, the only son of Prince Pierre of Monaco, Duke of Valentinois and his wife, the <b>Monegasque</b> Hereditary Princess, Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois. Rainier was the first {{native-born}} hereditary prince of Monaco since Honore IV in 1758. Rainier's mother was {{the only child of}} Prince Louis II of Monaco and Marie Juliette Louvet; she was later legitimized through formal adoption and subsequently named heir presumptive to the throne of Monaco. Rainier's father was a half-French, half-Mexican who adopted his wife's surname, Grimaldi, upon marriage and was made a prince of Monaco by Prince Louis, his father-in-law. Rainier had one sibling, Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy.|$|E
25|$|Télé Monte Carlo (TMC) {{has also}} {{declared}} that Monaco {{would not be}} returning to the Eurovision Song Contest for the 2010 Edition, mainly {{due to a lack}} of finances to send a <b>Monegasque</b> entry. The RTL Group had announced that they were having serious discussions regarding a possible comeback for Luxembourg in the contest for the first time since 1993, but later confirmed that the country would not be present for the 2010 Contest either. San Marino also considered returning to the competition in 2010. However, after deliberations with Italian artists, including Italian sister duo Paola & Chiara, Sammarinnese broadcaster Radiotelevisione della Repubblica di San Marino (SMRTV) was informed to withhold returning after failing to receive funding from the Sammarinnese parliament or sponsors.|$|E
25|$|In 1936 {{he won the}} Capri tournament meeting Jacques Jamain in the {{championship}} match. He also won the mixed doubles with Toto Zehden. In January 1937 he lost the doubles final in Saint Moritz, playing with von Metaxa, to Frenchmen Christian Boussus and Paul Féret. In March he lost the Nice title to Kho Sin-Kie in straight sets. At the same tournament he reached the double final as well with von Metaxa. In April he clinched the <b>Monegasque</b> Championships by beating Marcel Bernard in a five set match. He also took the doubles title with von Metaxa defeating Daniel Prenn and Vladimir Landau. In March 1938 he was victorious at the Cannes L.T.C. tournament where he eliminated Swedish champion Karl Schroeder. Schroeder took revenge in the doubles final where he teamed up with seasoned player Jacques Brugnon of the Four Musketeers to stop the Baworowski-von Metaxa duo in a five set match.|$|E
25|$|After {{ascending}} the throne, Rainier worked assiduously {{to recoup}} Monaco's lustre, {{which had become}} tarnished through neglect (especially financial) and scandal (his mother, Princess Charlotte, took a noted jewel thief known as René the Cane as her lover). According to numerous obituaries, the prince was faced upon his ascension with a treasury that was practically empty. The small nation's traditional gambling clientele, largely European aristocrats, found themselves with reduced funds after World War II. Other gambling centers had opened to compete with Monaco, many of them successfully. To compensate for this loss of income, Rainier decided to promote Monaco as a tax haven, commercial center, real-estate development opportunity, and international tourist attraction. The early years of his reign saw the overweening involvement of the Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, who {{took control of the}} Société des Bains de Mer (SBM) and envisioned Monaco as solely a gambling resort. Prince Rainier regained control of SBM in 1964, effectively ensuring that his vision of Monaco would be implemented. In addition, the Societé <b>Monégasque</b> de Banques et de Métaux Précieux, a bank which held a significant amount of Monaco's capital, was bankrupted by its investments in a media company in 1955, leading to the resignation of Monaco's cabinet.|$|E
