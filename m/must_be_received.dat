25|$|There are {{situations}} in which a nationwide time is in effect. In the case of business activities, a national time can be used. For example, a prospectus for the issue of stock in a company would usually set the closing time for offers at some location (e.g. Sydney) as the time when offers <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>received,</b> regardless {{of the source of}} the offer. Similarly, tenders for their sale of stock usually set out the time at a given location by which they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>received</b> to be considered. Another example is the Australian Stock Exchange which operates on Eastern Standard Time.|$|E

25|$|Hoyos did {{not look}} any closer, but rushed to the station and took a special train to Vienna. He hurried to the Emperor's Adjutant General, Count Paar, and {{requested}} him to break the appalling news to the Emperor. The stifling protocol that characterized every movement in the Hofburg swung ponderously into action; Paar remonstrated that only the Empress could break such catastrophic news to the Emperor. Baron Nopcsa, Controller of the Empress's Household, was sent for, and he in turn sent for Countess Ida Ferenczy, Empress Elisabeth's favorite Hungarian lady-in-waiting, to determine how Her Majesty should be informed. Elisabeth was at her Greek lesson, and was impatient at the interruption. White to the lips, Ferenczy announced that Baron Nopcsa had urgent news. Elisabeth replied that he must wait and come back later. The countess insisted that he <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>received</b> immediately, finally being forced to add that there was grave news about the Crown Prince. This account comes from Ferenczy herself and Archduchess Marie Valerie, to whom Elisabeth dictated her memory of the incident, {{in addition to the}} description in her diary.|$|E
500|$|During {{the fall}} admissions filing period, the CSU designates {{academic}} programs where more applications are received {{than can be}} accommodated by the campus, and designates them as [...] "impacted". At Cal Poly Pomona, impacted academic programs include: Animal Health Science, Animal Science, Aerospace Engineering, Chemical and Materials Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Architecture, Psychology, Sociology, Communication, Biology, Biotechnology, and undeclared programs. As such, applicants are rank ordered by eligibility index regardless of local admissions area and are accepted as space permits. Cal Poly Pomona students who wish to change majors to an impacted program must meet supplemental requirements required for that major. Requesting a change to an impacted majors <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>received</b> {{by the end of}} the initial filing period for the term for which new majors are being accepted (i.e. By February 28, 2010 for summer 2011; November 30, 2010 for fall 2011; June 30, 2011 for winter 2012; or August 31, 2011 for spring 2012).|$|E

2500|$|If a {{clock is}} sent in {{parallel}} with data, that clock {{can be used to}} sample the data. [...] Because the clock <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>received</b> and amplified before it can drive the flip-flops which sample the data, there will be a finite, and process-, temperature-, and voltage-dependent delay between the detected clock edge and the received data window. [...] This delay limits the frequency at which data can be sent. [...] One way of eliminating this delay is to include a deskew PLL on the receive side, so that the clock at each data flip-flop is phase-matched to the received clock. In that type of application, a special form of a PLL called a delay-locked loop (DLL) is frequently used.|$|E
30|$|For the A-B structure, CNC is {{employed}} at node C, which combines {{each pair of}} packets received from node A and node B, and then broadcasts the combined packet back to those nodes. Transmission delay and energy consumption in a shared network can be reduced {{at the cost of}} lower reliability of transmitted data. This <b>is</b> because to <b>receive</b> the transmitted data correctly at nodes A and B, all data packets involved in the network coding operation <b>must</b> <b>be</b> successfully <b>received</b> by node C, while the network coded packets at node C <b>must</b> <b>be</b> successfully <b>received</b> by nodes A and B.|$|R

Because Chief Justice Kinser {{returned}} {{to the practice of}} law after she retired from the court, she is not currently subject to recall for service on the Court because of the ethical conflict this would create between her practice of the law and her role as a justice. Moreover, justices serving in senior status or sitting by designation <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>receiving</b> benefits from the Virginia Retirement System, and under the rules applying to judges and justices, receipt of retirement benefits precludes the judge or justice from engaging in the private practice of law.|$|R

2500|$|While deuterocanonical {{books were}} {{referenced}} by some fathers as Scripture, {{men such as}} Athanasius held that they were for reading only {{and not to be}} used for determination of doctrine. Athanasius includes the Book of Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah in the list of the Canon of the Old Testament, and excludes the Book of Esther. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, [...] "the inferior rank to which the deuteros were relegated by authorities like Origen, Athanasius, and Jerome, was due to too rigid a conception of canonicity, one demanding that a book, to be entitled to this supreme dignity, <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>received</b> by all, must have the sanction of Jewish antiquity, and must moreover be adapted not only to edification, but also to the 'confirmation of the doctrine of the Church', to borrow Jerome's phrase." ...|$|E
2500|$|Each September the Academy's Economics Prize Committee, which {{consists}} of five elected members, [...] "sends invitations to thousands of scientists, members of academies and university professors in numerous countries, asking them to nominate candidates for the Prize in Economics for the coming year. Members of the Academy and former laureates are also authorised to nominate candidates." [...] All proposals and their supporting evidence <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>received</b> before February 1. The proposals are reviewed by the Prize Committee and specially appointed experts. Before the end of September, the committee chooses potential laureates. If there is a tie, {{the chairman of the}} committee casts the deciding vote. Next, the potential laureates must be approved by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Members of the Ninth Class (the social sciences division) of the Academy vote in mid-October to determine the next laureate or laureates of the Prize in Economics. As with the Nobel Prizes, no more than three people can share the prize for a given year; they must still be living {{at the time of the}} Prize announcement in October; and information about Prize nominations cannot be disclosed publicly for 50 years.|$|E

50|$|The {{problem may}} not be that talent and skill are rewarded, but that the rewards are based on {{relative}} talent and skill.

If {{there is no hope}} in the future of these players being rewarded, they will likely leave the game, causing the population to shrink, and thus reducing {{the number of people who}} can be in the top 20%. Grinding has the benefit that, although only 20% of the population may be rewarded at any given time, 100% of the population will have the potential to be rewarded in the future, and will have no reason to quit.|$|R

40|$|College {{football}} coaches’ {{employment contracts}} and compensation garner public attention and scrutiny {{in much the}} same way as those of corporate CEOs. In both cases, the public perception <b>is</b> that they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> overpaid and pampered. Economic theory claims that for coaches and CEOs to <b>be</b> overpaid, they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>receiving</b> compensation in excess of the value they create for their organizations. However, both receive pay-for-performance compensation, which structurally aligns their compensation with value creation. This means we need to examine the underlying structure of the contract that gives rise to the observed compensation to determine whether they are appropriately compensated. We compare the employment contracts of Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) college football coaches with those of corporate CEOs during the period 2005 to 2013. We find that coaches are not overpaid, and their contracts are fairly drawn. We also show that CEO and coach contracts exhibit many common features. These contract features are consistent with what economic theory would predict...|$|R
