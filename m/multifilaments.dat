The adherence of Staphylococcus aureus was measured in vitro by fluorescence analysis. Additionally, the two mesh materials (8 -mm platelets) were implanted subcutaneously in Sprague-Dawley rats with daily surveillance for clinical signs of infection. After 7 days the meshes were explanted for histological and microbiological analysis. Calculations of the mesh surface area revealed a higher level for the <b>multifilament</b> mesh.

In vivo, the implantation of meshes in the presence of S. aureus did not show an increased infection rate in rats with either monofilament or <b>multifilament</b> material.

The main subject of the study was the bridging of fibers by interphase material, a general phenomenon of sol-gel coatings. A three-point bending test is proposed as a semi-quantitative method to determine the characteristic stiffening of bridged fiber bundles. This method is successfully used to evaluate the influence of sol concentration on fiber bridging and to prove the benefit of additional surfactants to aqueous sols. Differences in film formation on the individual fiber surfaces leading to homogeneous or inhomogeneous film thickness and variation in degree of fiber surface coverage are explained with a three-fiber model. Based on model and experiment it is shown that even surface coverage and homogeneous film thickness can better be accomplished by multiple coatings from low concentrated sols than by single coatings from high concentrated sols.

The observed polymerized actin filaments, to which our most intense attention was attracted, was discretely distributed and showed obvious polymorphism distinctly different from those in the presence of phalloidin or actin binding proteins (fimbrin, gelsolin, etc.) in previous experiments.
