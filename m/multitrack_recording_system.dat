5000|$|In the {{recording}} studio, some lead singers record their own backing vocals by overdubbing with a <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> <b>system.</b> A <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> <b>system</b> enables the record producer to add {{many layers of}} recordings over top of each other. Using a multitrack system, a lead vocalist can record {{his or her own}} backing vocals, and then record the lead vocal part over top. Some lead vocalists prefer this approach because the sound of their own harmonies will blend well with their main vocal.|$|E
50|$|Phillips also {{provided}} {{many of the}} sound effects for the programmes, and {{was known for his}} experimental attitude towards creating the sounds he wanted, including use of an early <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> <b>system,</b> reverb, and adjustment of tape speed to create different effects. Many of Phillips' recordings were made available as vinyl records, particularly the Trumptonshire and Rubovia series. Phillips died in Ewell, Surrey, in October 2003.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} in <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> came in 1953, when musician Les Paul devised {{the concept of}} 8-track recording; this was commercially developed by the Ampex corporation, which launched its first [...] "Sel-Sync" [...] (Selective Synchronous) <b>recording</b> <b>system</b> in 1955, but for the next 35 years, <b>multitrack</b> audio <b>recording</b> technology was largely confined to specialist radio, TV and music recording studios, primarily because multitrack tape machines were both very large and very expensive - the first Ampex 8-track recorder, installed in Les Paul's home studio in 1957, cost a princely US$10,000 - roughly three times the US average yearly income in 1957, and equivalent to around $90,000 in 2016. However, this situation changed radically in 1979 {{with the introduction of}} the TASCAM Portastudio, which used the inexpensive compact audio cassette as the recording medium, making good-quality 4-track (and later 8-track) <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> available to the average consumer for the first time. Ironically, by the time the Portastudio had become popular, electronics companies were already introducing digital audio <b>recording</b> <b>systems,</b> and by the 1990s, computer-based digital <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> <b>systems</b> such as Pro Tools and Cubase were being adopted by the recording industry, and soon became standard. By the early 2000s, rapid advances in home computing and digital audio software were making digital <b>multitrack</b> audio <b>recording</b> <b>systems</b> available to the average consumer, and high-quality digital <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> <b>systems</b> like GarageBand were being included as a standard feature on home computers.|$|R
30|$|We {{propose a}} low {{complexity}} detection technique for multihead <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> <b>systems.</b> By exploiting sparseness of two-dimensional partial response (PR) channels, we develop an algorithm which performs belief propagation (BP) over corresponding factor graphs. We consider the BP-based detector {{not only for}} partial response channels but also for more practical conventional media and bit-patterned media storage systems, with and without media noise. Compared to the maximum likelihood detector which has a prohibitively high complexity that is exponential with both the number of tracks {{and the number of}} intersymbol interference (ISI) taps, the proposed detector has a much lower complexity and a fast parallel structure. For the <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> <b>systems</b> with PR equalization, the price is a small performance penalty (less than one dB if the intertrack interference (ITI) is not too high). Furthermore, since the algorithm is soft-input soft-output in nature, turbo equalization can be employed if there is an outer code. We show that a few turbo equalization iterations can provide significant performance improvement even when the ITI level is high.|$|R

50|$|While Lee de Forest {{struggled}} to market Photofilm, Charles A. Hoxie's Pallophotophone had success as an optical recording device through {{the support of}} General Electric. The Pallophotophone utilized the entire width of unsprocketed 35mm Kodak monochrome film to record and replay multiple audio tracks. Unlike Photofilm, this optical sound technology used a photoelectric process that captured audio wave forms generated by a vibrating mirror galvanometer, {{and was the first}} effective <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> <b>system,</b> predating magnetic tape multitrack recorders by at least 20 years. From the early 1920s until the early 30s, GE broadcast over 1,000 Pallophotophone recordings from its Schenectady, New York radio station WGY, including speeches by presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover, and inventor-businessmen Thomas Edison and Henry Ford.|$|E
50|$|Surviving {{examples}} of pallophotophone recordings have several tracks recorded in parallel on each strip of film, and Hoxie's system has therefore {{been called the}} world's first <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> <b>system,</b> as it predates magnetic tape multitrack recording by several decades. However, unlike later multitrack optical, magnetic, and digital sound recording systems, multiple tracks on pallophotophone films are not {{known to have been}} used for later mixdown or similar post-production purposes, or for simultaneously recording two or more channels for stereophonic sound reproduction. Multiple narrow tracks, recorded one at a time in separate passes through the device, simply made much more economical use of the medium by multiplying the total recording time possible on a given length of 35 mm film running at a given speed.|$|E
50|$|With 20th-century music, {{there was}} a vast {{increase}} in music listening, as the radio gained popularity and phonographs were used to replay and distribute music. The invention of sound recording {{and the ability to}} edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the acousmatic and Musique concrète schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> <b>system</b> had a major influence on rock music, because it could do much more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a simple and}} practical error control mechanism that allows multiple-errors and multiple-erasures correction for <b>multitrack</b> magnetic <b>recording</b> <b>systems.</b> The proposed mechanism is based on using a simple and fast hash function to locate erroneous tracks in magnetic tape and exploit the MDS property of array codes to correct these tracks as erasures. The mechanism enables MDS array codes with r parity symbols to correct s tracks in error and t erased tracks (s + t ≤ r) with negligible probability of undetected error. The proposed mechanism reduces the redundancy requirement,for a given degree of reliability, by almost 50 % from that needed by conventional systems. It also reduces the encoding and decoding complexity for <b>multitrack</b> magnetic <b>recording</b> channels. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we perform a minimum {{distance}} {{analysis of a}} class of two dimensional intersymbol interference channels. In particular, some important cases of <b>multitrack</b> multihead magnetic <b>recording</b> <b>systems</b> fall into the studied class. Previously, Soljanin and Georghiades have studied the same problem as we do. The results derived in this paper are more conclusive and they improve upon theirs. The fundamental proof technique that we will use is to transform the channel into an equivalent minimum phase channel. I...|$|R

50|$|The {{focus of}} art {{music in the}} 20th century was {{characterized}} by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of World War I influenced many of the arts, including music, and some composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds. Traditional music styles such as jazz and folk music were used by composers {{as a source of}} ideas for classical music. Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, and John Cage were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of sound recording and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the acousmatic and Musique concrète schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed.

40|$|Two-dimensional {{magnetic}} recording 2 -D (TDMR) is a promising technology for next generation magnetic storage systems {{based on a}} systems-level framework involving sophisticated signal processing at the core. The TDMR channel suffers from severe jitter noise along with electronic noise {{that needs to be}} mitigated during signal detection and recovery. Recently, we developed noise prediction-based techniques coupled with advanced signal detectors to work with these systems. However, {{it is important to understand}} the role of harmful patterns that can be avoided during the encoding process. In this paper, we investigate the Voronoi-based media model to study the harmful patterns over <b>multitrack</b> shingled <b>recording</b> <b>systems.</b> Through realistic quasi-micromagnetic simulation studies, we identify 2 -D data patterns that contribute to high media noise. We look into the generic Voronoi model and present our analysis on multitrack detection with constrained coded data. We show that the 2 -D constraints imposed on input patterns result in an order of magnitude improvement in the bit-error rate for the TDMR systems. The use of constrained codes can reduce the complexity of 2 -D intersymbol interference (ISI) signal detection, since the lesser 2 -D ISI span can be accommodated at the cost of a nominal code rate loss. However, a system must be designed carefully so that the rate loss incurred by a 2 -D constraint does not offset the detector performance gain due to more distinguishable readback signals...|$|R
