5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter <b>males,</b> so sexual selection could result in aposematic <b>males</b> having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic <b>males</b> if they can survive long enough to mate. Sexual selection {{is strong enough to}} allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait.|$|E
5|$|A male {{sea otter}} {{is most likely}} to mate if he {{maintains}} a breeding territory in an area that is also favored by females. As autumn is the peak breeding season in most areas, <b>males</b> typically defend their territory only from spring to autumn. During this time, <b>males</b> patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other <b>males,</b> although actual fighting is rare. Adult females move freely between male territories, where they outnumber adult <b>males</b> by an average of five to one. <b>Males</b> that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.|$|E
5|$|A {{study on}} albinistic prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) found that {{albinism}} in this species conferred an {{advantage for the}} <b>males</b> compared to the wild-type; albino <b>males</b> had higher mount frequencies than wild-type <b>males.</b> In addition, the albinos had greater differential fertilizing capacity.|$|E

5|$|Adult <b>males</b> {{are less}} ready to pursue and less {{efficient}} at catching than adult females, especially against larger prey. <b>Males</b> are quite effective against small web spiders, and reluctant to tackle large ones although they catch them in about 50% of attempts. Against other jumping spiders, <b>males</b> do not pursue large ones and pursue about 48% of small ones, catching 84% of those they pursue. <b>Males</b> of Portia do not build large webs for catching prey ("capture webs").|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{explained}} such male-female {{differences in}} {{his theory of}} sexual selection in his book The Descent of Man. Once the females begin to select <b>males</b> according to any particular characteristic, such as a long tail or a coloured crest, that characteristic is emphasized {{more and more in}} the <b>males.</b> Eventually all the <b>males</b> will have the characteristics that the females are sexually selecting for, as only those <b>males</b> can reproduce. This mechanism is powerful enough to create features that are strongly disadvantageous to the <b>males</b> in other ways. For example, some male birds of paradise have wing or tail streamers that are so long that they impede flight, while their brilliant colours may make the <b>males</b> more vulnerable to predators. In the extreme, sexual selection may drive species to extinction, as has been argued for the enormous horns of the male Irish elk, which may have made it difficult for mature <b>males</b> to move and feed.|$|E
5|$|Different {{forms of}} sexual {{selection}} are possible, including rivalry among <b>males,</b> and selection of females by <b>males.</b>|$|E

5|$|Females {{grow faster}} than <b>males</b> overall, {{and must be}} larger to mature sexually. In most populations <b>males</b> reach sexual {{maturity}} at 2–4years old, and females at 6–10.

5|$|In the phlaeothripids {{that feed}} on fungi, <b>males</b> compete {{to protect and}} mate with females, and then defend the egg-mass. <b>Males</b> fight by {{flicking}} their rivals away with their abdomen, and may kill with their foretarsal teeth. Small <b>males</b> may sneak in to mate while the larger <b>males</b> are busy fighting. In the Merothripidae and in the Aeolothripidae, <b>males</b> are again polymorphic with large and small forms, and probably also compete for mates, so the strategy may well be ancestral among the Thysanoptera.|$|E

5|$|<b>Males</b> {{and females}} prefer {{different}} foraging sites. While <b>males</b> usually hover among the higher shrub foliage between , females tend to forage at lower strata.

5|$|<b>Males</b> {{establish}} their dominance more forcefully than females. A male disperses, or leaves his natal group and joins another group, after reaching sexual maturity. Adult <b>males</b> are very competitive {{with each other}} and fight for access to females. Higher dominance means better access to mating and earlier access to food, so naturally a great deal of fighting over rank occurs, with younger <b>males</b> constantly trying to rise in position. Because females stay with their groups their entire lives, and <b>males</b> emigrate to others, often a new male challenges an older one for dominance. Frequently, when older baboons drop in the social hierarchy, they move to another tribe. The younger <b>males</b> who pushed them down often bullies and harasses them. Older <b>males</b> tend to have more supportive and equal relationships than those of the younger <b>males.</b> The former may form coalitions against the latter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Males</b> of fly {{species such}} as Cuterebra, many hover flies, bee flies (Bombyliidae) and fruit flies (Tephritidae) {{maintain}} territories within which they engage in aerial pursuit to drive away intruding <b>males</b> and other species. While these territories may be held by individual <b>males,</b> some species form leks with many <b>males</b> aggregating in displays. Some flies maintain an airspace and still others form dense swarms that maintain a stationary location with respect to landmarks. Many flies mate in flight while swarming.|$|E
5|$|<b>Males</b> {{that have}} been unable to court a female {{successfully}} may try to achieve reproductive success in other ways. In sunfish species, like the bluegill, larger, older <b>males</b> known as parental <b>males,</b> which have successfully courted a female, construct nests for the eggs they fertilise. Smaller satellite <b>males</b> mimic female behaviour and coloration to access a nest and fertilise the eggs. Other <b>males,</b> known as sneaker <b>males,</b> lurk nearby and then quickly dash to the nest, fertilising on the run. These <b>males</b> are smaller than satellite <b>males.</b> Sneaker <b>males</b> also exist in Oncorhynchus salmon, where small <b>males</b> that were unable to establish a position near a female dash in while the large dominant male is spawning with the female.|$|E
