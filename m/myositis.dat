5|$|As the autobodies {{are found}} mainly in {{patients}} that have characteristics of several different autoimmune diseases, the clinical symptoms {{of these patients}} can vary widely. The symptoms that are seen most often are the typical symptoms of the individual autoimmune diseases and include Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis, <b>myositis</b> and scleroderma. Treatment of these patients is symptomatic and is similar to treatment for the individual autoimmune disease, often involving either immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs.|$|E
5|$|Blood tests may be {{performed}} to exclude other causes of muscle disease (elevated creatine kinase may indicate a <b>myositis,</b> and abnormal thyroid function tests may indicate thyrotoxic myopathy). Antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels {{can be identified}} in 85% of people with EMG-confirmed LEMS. Once LEMS is diagnosed, investigations such as a CT scan of the chest are usually performed to identify any possible underlying lung tumors. Around 50–60% of these are discovered immediately after the diagnosis of LEMS. The remainder is diagnosed later, but usually within two years and typically within four years. As a result, scans are typically repeated every six months {{for the first two}} years after diagnosis. While CT of the lungs is usually adequate, a positron emission tomography scan of the body may also {{be performed}} to search for an occult tumour, particularly of the lung.|$|E

25|$|Fatal {{infection}} of an alpaca (Lama pacos) with an unnamed species has been reported. Findings included disseminated eosinophilic <b>myositis,</b> abortion and haemoabdomen. The <b>myositis</b> {{was associated with}} hameorrhage, necrosis and degeration. Infection by S. tilopodi of muscle tissue in the Guanaco has been reported.|$|E

25|$|Four {{recognised}} species infect pigs: S. medusiformis, S. meischeriana (S. suicanis), S. porcifelis and S. suihominis. S. porcifelis is pathogenic for pigs causing diarrhea, <b>myositis</b> and lameness.|$|E
25|$|For {{systemic}} symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain, <b>myositis</b> and neuropathy, biologic immunosuppressant {{drugs such}} as rituximab and belimumab that work via B-cell pathology are often used and have less toxic profiles than traditional immunosuppressive regimens.|$|E
25|$|Because {{infection}} is rarely symptomatic, treatment is rarely required. There {{have been no}} published trials so treatment remains empirical. Agents {{that have been used}} include albendazole, metronidazole and cotrimoxazole for <b>myositis.</b> Corticosteroids have also been used for symptomatic relief.|$|E
25|$|Masticatory muscle <b>myositis</b> (MMM) is an {{inflammatory}} disease in dogs affecting {{the muscles of}} the jaw. Signs include swelling of the jaw muscles and pain on opening the mouth. In chronic MMM there is atrophy of the jaw muscles, and scarring of the masticatory muscles due to fibrosis may result in inability to open the mouth (trismus).|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} (>1% incidence) may include {{indigestion}} and eczema. Rare side effects include joint pain, memory loss, and muscle cramps. Cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, rhabdomyolysis (destruction of muscles and blockade of renal system), and <b>myositis</b> {{have been reported}} in patients receiving the drug chronically. Serious allergic reactions to simvastatin are rare. If the following signs of a serious allergic reaction occur, seek medical attention immediately: rash, hoarsness itching/swelling, dizziness, or difficulty swallowing/breathing.|$|E
25|$|At {{very high}} doses, AZT's {{triphosphate}} form may also inhibit DNA polymerase used by human cells to undergo cell division, {{but regardless of}} dosage AZT has an approximately 100-fold greater affinity for HIV's reverse transcriptase. The selectivity has been proven {{to be due to}} the cell's ability to quickly repair its own DNA chain if it is broken by AZT during its formation, whereas the HIV virus lacks that ability. Thus AZT inhibits HIV replication without affecting the function of uninfected cells. At sufficiently high dosages, AZT begins to inhibit the cellular DNA polymerase used by mitochondria to replicate, accounting for its potentially toxic but reversible effects on cardiac and skeletal muscles, causing <b>myositis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sheep may be {{infected}} by four recognized species of Sarcocystis: S. arieticanis and S. tenella (S. ovicanis) are pathogenic; S. gigantea (S. ovifelis) and S. medusiformis are non-pathogenic. Infection with these parasites {{is common in}} the US with over 80% of sheep examined showing evidence of infection. S. arieticanis and S. tenella both produce extra intestinal disease. Anemia, anorexia, ataxia, and abortions are the chief clinical signs. <b>Myositis</b> with flaccid paralysis has been reported {{as a consequence of}} infection. Ovine protozoan myeloencephalitis is a recognised syndrome that may occur in outbreaks. The usual pathological findings in such cases are multifocal spinal cord white matter oedema and necrosis, glial nodules and mild to moderate nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis. The diagnosis may be established finding protozoan bodies (12.7-23.0 micrometres) that stain immunocytochemically for Sarcocystis epitopes.|$|E
25|$|HLA {{types are}} inherited, {{and some of}} them are {{connected}} with autoimmune disorders and other diseases. People with certain HLA antigens are more likely to develop certain autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes, ankylosing spondylitis, celiac disease, SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), myasthenia gravis, inclusion body <b>myositis,</b> Sjögren syndrome, and narcolepsy. HLA typing has led to some improvement and acceleration in the diagnosis of celiac disease and type 1 diabetes; however, for DQ2 typing to be useful, it requires either high-resolution B1*typing (resolving *02:01 from *02:02), DQA1*typing, or DR serotyping. Current serotyping can resolve, in one step, DQ8. HLA typing in autoimmunity is being increasingly used as a tool in diagnosis. In celiac disease, it is the only effective means of discriminating between first-degree relatives that are at risk from those that are not at risk, prior to the appearance of sometimes-irreversible symptoms such as allergies and secondary autoimmune disease.|$|E
2500|$|Definitive {{diagnosis}} by biopsy of {{an infected}} muscle. Sarcocysts are identifiable with [...] hematoxylin and eosin. The PAS stain {{may be helpful}} but variable uptake of stain is common. Along with the sarcocysts inflammatory cells may be found. Other findings include <b>myositis,</b> myonecrosis, perivascular and interstitial inflammation, vasculitis and eosinophilic <b>myositis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{pathology}} is of two types: a rare invasive {{form with}} vasculitis and <b>myositis</b> and an intestinal form that presents [...] with nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. While normally mild and lasting under 48 hours, the intestinal form may occasionally be severe or even life-threatening. The invasive form may involve {{a wide variety}} of tissues including lymph nodes, muscles and the larynx.|$|E
2500|$|In {{species in}} which {{symptoms}} develop these typically occur 20–40 days after ingestion of sporocysts {{and during the}} subsequent migration of sporozoites through the body vessels. Acute lesions (oedema, hemorrhages and necrosis) develop in the affected tissues. The parasite has a predilection for skeletal muscle (<b>myositis),</b> cardiac muscle (petechial hemorrhages of cardiac muscle [...] and serosae), and lymph nodes (oedema, necrosis and hemorrhage). These lesions are associated with maturation of second generation of meronts within the endothelial and subendothelials cells. Occasionally mononuclear infiltration or hyperemia ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{hallmark}} {{symptom of}} SS is a generalized dryness, typically including dry mouth and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes), {{part of what}} are known as sicca ("dryness") symptoms. Sicca syndrome also incorporates vaginal dryness and chronic bronchitis. SS may cause skin, nose, and vaginal dryness, and may affect other organs of the body, including the muscles (<b>myositis),</b> kidneys, blood vessels, lungs, liver, biliary system, pancreas, peripheral nervous system (distal axonal [...] neuropathy or small fiber peripheral neuropathy) and brain. Some people have gastrointestinal or esophageal diseases such as GERD, achlorhydria or gastroparesis. Chronic pain with accompanying fatigue and brain fog may also occur.|$|E
2500|$|During this period, {{like most}} amateur triathletes, {{she had also}} {{continued}} entering running races. She had previously run the London Marathon for charity in 2002, finishing in 3:08:17, making her the fastest woman from her running club in that race. That result prompted her to get a running coach, Frank Horwill – whom she regarded as [...] "legendary and ever inspiring" [...] – and to take her running training much more seriously. She had hoped to improve her marathon time in the April 2003 London Marathon, but in March she collided with a car while riding her commuter bike in Clapham. The accident resulted in a haematoma in her left thigh, causing – in an example of <b>myositis</b> ossificans – a 5cm spur of bone to grow from her femur. Unable to run the marathon, she took up swimming again, leading her to try triathlon racing in 2004. After her ITU victory, she took up cross-country racing for the first time, {{as a means of}} building strength for her triathlon races. She enjoyed some success in B and C grade cross-country events around London, winning several races including the South of Thames Championship in December 2006.|$|E
