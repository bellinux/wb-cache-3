5|$|When {{the casket}} {{reached the top}} of the steps, Nancy Reagan and her {{military}} escort met it. As the casket passed them, Nancy <b>momentarily</b> pulled away from her escort, reached out, and touched the casket. They followed it inside to the rotunda.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{formation}} of Type Ia supernovae involves the merger of two white dwarf stars, with the combined mass <b>momentarily</b> exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit. There is much variation in this type of event, and in many cases there may be no supernova at all, but it is expected that they will have a broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal SN Type Ia.|$|E
5|$|However if {{the white}} dwarf merges with another white dwarf (a very rare event), it will <b>momentarily</b> exceed the limit and begin to collapse, again raising its {{temperature}} past the nuclear fusion ignition point. Within {{a few seconds of}} initiation of nuclear fusion, a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes a runaway reaction, releasing enough energy (1–) to unbind the star in a supernova explosion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} episode when Steve Owen pulls over Susie Money, when she hands him her license, one can <b>momentarily</b> see the birth date {{on the back of}} the card; it shows her birth year as 1984. Being that it is 1995 at the time of this scene, that would make her 11 years old.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{run of the}} men's doubles luge {{competition}} on 17 February 2010, Austria's team of Tobias Schiegl and Markus Schiegl survived a crash on turn 16 where they came in at too high of an elevation. Tobias tried to correct the oversteer {{only to have the}} cousins collide {{on the opposite side of}} the ice wall, causing both to go airborne <b>momentarily.</b> Neither suffered any injury.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln's bodyguard, John Parker, left Ford's Theater during {{intermission}} {{to drink}} at the saloon next door. The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony. Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13pm, aimed {{at the back of}} Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President. Major Henry Rathbone <b>momentarily</b> grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.|$|E
5|$|Many animals, {{including}} moths, butterflies, mantises, phasmids, and cephalopods such as octopuses, {{make use}} of patterns of threatening or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots, so as to scare off or <b>momentarily</b> distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{returns home}} where Walter has invited Bell {{to stay the}} evening. Bell {{explains}} that he believes that Dana {{was finally able to}} die after serving a purposesaving {{the lives of the people}} on the train. When church bells go off nearby, Olivia's personality slips through <b>momentarily.</b> Bell regains control, but expresses new-found fear that his possession of Olivia's body has become more complicated than he thought.|$|E
5|$|A seizure {{does not}} occur just because the {{government}} questions an individual in a public place. The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained. The government may not detain an individual even <b>momentarily</b> without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.|$|E
5|$|According to Burton Fisher, Puccini and Forzano {{borrowed}} {{heavily from}} the commedia dell'arte tradition in Gianni Schicchi. Schicchi himself recalls the roguish Harlequin, while his daughter Lauretta, whose romance is nearly foiled by Buoso's relatives, resembles Columbina. Simone {{is drawn from}} Pantaloon, while the poverty-stricken Betto recalls the buffoonish valet Zany. Doctor Spinelloccio recalls the classic doctor from the commedia dell'arte, Balanzone even to his Bolognese origin. The Moor whose death <b>momentarily</b> scares the relatives, and his captain, are stock characters from commedia dell'arte.|$|E
5|$|After the South Carolina debate, Biden campaigned in California {{to begin}} May 2007 {{attending}} events in San Francisco. Later {{in the month}} after President George W. Bush enacted economic sanctions against Sudan to pressure the government to end the genocide in Darfur, Biden <b>momentarily</b> shifted focus from Iraq to the crisis in Darfur. He released a statement {{on the campaign trail}} that expressed his belief that Bush was right to enact the sanctions. However, Biden argued that it was not enough, calling for a No-Fly Zone over the region and a possible commitment of United States forces to the nation.|$|E
5|$|Gielgud's final West End {{play was}} Hugh Whitemore's The Best of Friends (1988). He played Sir Sydney Cockerell, {{director}} of the Fitzwilliam Museum, in a representation of a friendship between Cockerell, Bernard Shaw and Laurentia McLachlan, a Benedictine nun. Gielgud had some trouble learning his lines; at one performance he almost forgot them, <b>momentarily</b> distracted by seeing in a 1938 copy of The Times, read by his character, a review of his own portrayal of Vershinin in Three Sisters fifty years earlier.|$|E
5|$|In Mario Kart DS, a kart is able {{to draft}} behind another kart to gain a speed boost <b>momentarily,</b> a feature that was also {{previously}} used in the 1996 video game Mario Kart 64. Mario Kart DS places a stronger focus on the feature and once again provides a visual cue when a kart is drafting. In an interview, Konno notes that they included tracks from previous Mario Kart games into Mario Kart DS so that players who played the original Super Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System would feel {{more familiar with the}} DS iteration of the series.|$|E
5|$|In the climax, we {{discover}} the Wanderers and the Del Bombers are settling their dispute {{not with a}} street fight but with a football game organized by Chubby. Richie uses {{the opportunity to make}} amends with Joey. A member of the Ducky Boys interrupts the game, as the Wanderers <b>momentarily</b> turn their heads, hundreds of Ducky Boys invade the field. Many of the Wanderers and the Del Bombers flee, but some stand their ground. The remaining players join forces with spectator gangs in the stands, including one called the Wongs and even Emilio. After a long and bloody battle, the Ducky Boys flee.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} first nationally {{telecast}} bulletin about the shooting was made by Kathleen Sullivan {{as part of a}} standard newscast on Cable News Network; Sullivan reported that Lennon had been shot but his condition was not known {{at the time of the}} bulletin. NBC-TV <b>momentarily</b> broke into its East Coast feed of The Best of Carson for its bulletin of Lennon's death before returning in the middle of a comedy piece being performed by Johnny Carson.|$|E
5|$|Mary is {{presented}} as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel. The idea of a saint appearing before laity was common in Northern art of the period, and is also represented in van Eyck's Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1434–36). There, the Canon is portrayed as if having just <b>momentarily</b> paused to reflect on a passage from his hand-held bible as the Virgin and Child with two saints appear before him, as if embodiments of his prayer.|$|E
5|$|Ney now had two problems: he {{expected}} support columns from Soult's division on both flanks to arrive <b>momentarily</b> {{and he did}} not know that the Austrians had arrived in force, directly in front of his center. Although Roget's brigade was strong enough to prevent the Austrians from flanking the position, Gazan's brigade was too weak to resist the superior Austrian force, which was growing visibly stronger as Hotze's troops continued to arrive at the forward line and throw themselves into the fray.|$|E
5|$|On Cemetery Ridge, Generals Meade and Hancock were {{scrambling}} to find reinforcements. Meade had sent {{virtually all of}} his available troops (including most of the XII Corps, who would be needed <b>momentarily</b> on Culp's Hill) to his left flank to counter Longstreet's assault, leaving {{the center of his}} line relatively weak. There was insufficient infantry on Cemetery Ridge and only a few artillery pieces, rallied from the debacle of the Peach Orchard by Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery.|$|E
5|$|Sercey, {{under orders}} not to risk his squadron, and fearing {{that he was}} facing a {{superior}} force, retreated, declining to risk a battle. Sercey did <b>momentarily</b> reconsider when the British ships equally declined to attack the temporarily disabled frigate Forte, but eventually withdrew completely. He retired to his base at Île de France (now Mauritius) where he learned of his error. The East Indiamen reached reached Whampoa Anchorage having lost only one ship, which wrecked in the Flores Sea in a storm {{the day after the}} encounter.|$|E
5|$|Six partygoers {{simultaneously}} fall to {{the sidewalk}} outside the Rosencrantz apartment building in Brooklyn, apparently having jumped from a seventh floor balcony along with the balcony's furniture. When the Fringe team investigates, Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter (John Noble) determine by {{the location of the}} bodies that they seem to have fallen through the balcony, as if it <b>momentarily</b> ceased to exist. From other stories of strange phenomena occurring throughout the building, Walter concludes that the same cracks in reality that have harmed the parallel universe are starting to appear in the prime one, with the building occupying a weak spot between universes.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals such as}} many moths, mantises and grasshoppers, have a {{repertory}} {{of threatening}} or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots or patches of bright and contrasting colours, so as to scare off or <b>momentarily</b> distract a predator. This gives the prey animal an opportunity to escape. The behaviour is deimatic (startling) rather than aposematic as these insects are palatable to predators, so the warning colours are a bluff, not an honest signal.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's love of Isabelle {{transforms}} into {{a passionate}} affair. Isabelle confronts Azaire {{with the truth}} of their relationship and Azaire evicts Stephen. Isabelle leaves with him, running away to Southern France. There she becomes pregnant, and <b>momentarily</b> loses faith in her relationship with Stephen. Without telling Stephen, she flees, returning to her family home and the one constant in her life: her sister Jeanne. Later, Isabelle's father makes a deal with Azaire for her return to maintain her honour; Isabelle is forgiven but soon regrets leaving her true love, Stephen. However, she does not reach back out to Stephen.|$|E
5|$|The adverse results <b>momentarily</b> {{put a stop}} to Republican {{calls to}} impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections. Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee {{reversed}} itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{day of the}} bris arrives, and Kyle is {{grounded}} for sending Ike away. When the mohel arrives to perform the bris, Ike flees to Kyle's room in terror. Seeing Ike in distress and some old pictures prompts {{a change of heart}} in Kyle, and he defends his brother fiercely before it is explained to him what a circumcision actually is, at which point Stan and Cartman decide they want to be circumcised too. They watch the process; even though the boys pass out <b>momentarily,</b> Kyle is relieved to see Ike unharmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} may not detain an individual even <b>momentarily</b> without reasonable and articulable suspicion, {{with a few}} exceptions. In Delaware v. Prouse (1979), the Court ruled an officer has made an illegal seizure when he stops an automobile and detains the driver in order to check his driver's license and the registration of the automobile, unless the officer has articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered, or either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law.|$|E
5|$|The myth's {{religious}} importance {{extended beyond}} the funerary sphere. Mortuary offerings, in which {{family members or}} hired priests presented food to the deceased, were logically linked with the mythological offering of the Eye of Horus to Osiris. By analogy, this episode of the myth was eventually equated with other interactions between a human and a being in the divine realm. In temple offering rituals, the officiating priest took {{on the role of}} Horus, the gifts to the deity became the Eye of Horus, and whichever deity received these gifts was <b>momentarily</b> equated with Osiris.|$|E
5|$|The {{review board}} {{determined}} that the electrical power <b>momentarily</b> failed at 23:30:55 GMT, and found evidence of several electric arcs in the interior equipment. They were unable to identify conclusively a single ignition source. They {{determined that the}} fire most likely started near {{the floor in the}} lower left section of the cabin, close to the Environmental Control Unit. It spread from the left wall of the cabin to the right, with the floor being affected only briefly.|$|E
5|$|The third story {{describes}} Parvati being banished by Shiva {{when she}} becomes <b>momentarily</b> distracted {{while listening to}} his explanation of the Vedas. Parvati, now born as Kayarkanni, {{is the daughter of}} a fisherman. When playing with her friends, Shiva approaches {{in the guise of a}} fisherman and flirts with her, despite her disapproval. The fishermen often face problems due to a giant shark that disrupts their way of life. Shiva asserts that he alone can defeat the shark. After a long battle, Shiva subdues the shark (which is actually Nandi in disguise) and remarries Parvati.|$|E
5|$|As per his contract, Webber {{started the}} year in Melbourne with Red Bull Racing. He {{recorded}} top-six lap times {{in each of the}} three practice sessions, and was on his way to the top ten in the qualifying session when the front right brake disc in his car failed going into turn 6 during Q2, sending him spinning off into the sand trap ending his qualifying session, and resulting in 15th position on the grid. Although starting well, he <b>momentarily</b> went off the track at turn 1 to avoid being involved in contact that had already erupted. Webber made several positions by turn 3 but an incident involving himself, Kazuki Nakajima and Anthony Davidson when he was slightly contacted by Davidson whilst trying to avoid the struggle between the other two drivers, ended his race.|$|E
5|$|Captain San Pedro {{detected}} {{the movements of}} the American troops from his positions on a nearby hill and ordered his men to open fire. Garretson then ordered a direct attack on the Spanish and Puerto Rican forces in the hacienda. At day break, the 6th Massachusetts overran the Spanish forces and suffered four casualties. Puig was expecting reinforcements from Yauco which did not arrive and was ordered to disengage and retreat. Before retreating {{the right wing of the}} Spanish force, which was not overrun, initiated a flanking attack against two positions held by the Illinois and Massachusetts companies. The unexpected strength of the Spanish force caused some of the 6th Massachusetts troops to <b>momentarily</b> panic, but the Spanish forces were eventually driven off. Puig and his forces suffered two officers and three soldiers wounded and two soldiers dead.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the related}} grey and brown {{smoothhounds}} that share its range, the leopard shark has {{smaller and more}} numerous red blood cells, allowing it to process oxygen more efficiently. This may be an adaptation for foraging in deoxygenated estuary environments. Their eyes contain very few cone cells, likely due to the murky water they inhabit. Small leopard sharks fall prey to larger sharks such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). On one occasion, a sevengill shark was seen ambushing a leopard shark on a tidal mudflat in Humboldt Bay, striking with such momentum that the larger predator <b>momentarily</b> beached itself. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Phyllobothrium riseri, Lacistorhynchus dollfusi and Paraorygmatobothrium barber, {{as well as the}} copepods Echthrogaleus eoleoptratus and Achtheinus oblongatus.|$|E
5|$|Dax helps Worf save Kor, and {{afterwards}} takes {{possession of the}} sword because she thinks the two Klingons cannot be trusted with it. The three make camp and sleep through the night, but Dax is awoken by a scuffle between Kor and Worf. The fight between them stops <b>momentarily</b> after Toral and his men arrive. After Toral is subdued, Kor and Worf again attack each other. Jadzia shoots them both with her phaser set to stun and then forces Toral to deactivate the transport blocker so that the three can return to the Runabout. After they depart the planet, Kor and Worf realize that if the sword divided two men as honorable as they, it {{would do the same}} to the Klingon Empire, so they beam it into space, leaving it to drift until the Klingon Empire is ready for it.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} possesses individual {{strengths and}} weaknesses. The hero, while unable to use magic, masters weapons at a quicker rate; {{the girl is}} a healer, able to cast restorative and support spells; and the sprite casts offensive magic to damage and impair enemies. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves {{in areas such as}} strength and evasion. The trio can rest in towns, where they can regain hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands, a circular menu which hovers over the currently controlled party member. The game is <b>momentarily</b> paused whenever the Ring Commands appear.|$|E
5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to {{one side or the other}} and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch from side to side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are <b>momentarily</b> engaged.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder {{attends a}} parole hearing for Monte Propps, {{a serial killer}} he helped to {{apprehend}} in the late 1980s. Propps' method of killing involved brainwashing his kidnapped victims until {{they were willing to}} commit suicide by drowning; however he is now seen as a model reformee and is released. Shortly afterwards, Mulder meets with Frank Black, who warns him of the dangers of the offender's freedom. The two visit the released man's halfway house, arriving shortly after his parole officer; inside they find Propps drowned in his bath. In an alley outside, they parole officer is also found dead, with the ouroboros symbol of the Millennium Group tattooed on her neck. A child in the alley <b>momentarily</b> speaks to Black with the voice of a demonic entity he recognises, warning of impending disaster.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist's form dipped <b>momentarily,</b> {{with a rare}} king pair (two golden {{ducks in}} the same match) in the Second Test in Kolkata and just two runs in his two innings in Chennai. He was out LBW four {{consecutive}} {{times in the last}} two Tests, three of these to Harbhajan Singh, who took 32 wickets in the series to end Australia's run by inflicting a 2–1 series loss. His one-day form remained strong, with 172 runs at 43.00 in the ODI series in India, as Australia bounced back to win the series 3–2. During this series he captained the ODI team for the first time, winning all three of the matches under his captaincy.|$|E
