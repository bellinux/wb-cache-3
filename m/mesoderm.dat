5|$|The <b>mesoderm</b> {{does not}} form by enterocoely in phoronids and bryozoans, but does in deuterostomes, {{while there are}} {{disagreements}} about whether brachiopods form the <b>mesoderm</b> by enterocoely.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales of}} fish {{originate}} from the <b>mesoderm</b> (skin); they may be similar in structure to teeth.|$|E
5|$|Embryologically, the {{suspensory}} muscle of the duodenum {{is derived}} from <b>mesoderm.</b> It {{plays an important role}} in the embryological rotation of the small intestine as the superior retention band.|$|E
5|$|According to {{more recent}} analyses, in the {{development}} of nemertean embryos, ectomesoderm (outer part of the <b>mesoderm,</b> which is the layer in which most of the internal organs are built) is derived from cells labelled 3a and 3b, and endomesoderm (inner part of the <b>mesoderm)</b> is derived from the 4d cell. Some of the ectomesoderm in annelids, echiurans and molluscs is derived from cells 3a and 3b, while the ectomesoderm of polyclad flatworms is derived from the 2b cell and acoel flatworms produce no ectomesoderm. In nemerteans the space between the epidermis and the gut is mainly filled by well-developed muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue. This structure is similar to that found in larger flatworms such as polyclads and triclads, but a similar structure of body-wall muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue is widespread among the Spiralia (animals in which the early cell divisions make a spiral pattern) such as sipunculans, echiurans and many annelids.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2005 Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid {{suggested}} that cnidarians and ctenophores are simplified descendants of triploblastic animals, since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some cnidarians have striated muscle, which in bilaterians {{arises from the}} <b>mesoderm.</b> They did not commit themselves on whether bilaterians evolved from early cnidarians or from the hypothesized triploblastic ancestors of cnidarians.|$|E
5|$|The {{suspensory}} {{muscle is}} derived from <b>mesoderm</b> and {{plays a role in}} the embryological rotation of the gut, by offering a point of fixation for the rotating gut. It is also thought to help digestion by widening the angle of the duodenojejunal flexure. Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a rare abnormality caused by a congenitally-short suspensory muscle.|$|E
5|$|After implantation, {{around the}} second to third week the {{developing}} embryo consists of three layers: endoderm, <b>mesoderm</b> and ectoderm. The {{first part of the}} ear to develop is the inner ear, which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryoâ€™s development. Specifically, the inner ear derives from two thickenings called otic placodes {{on either side of the}} head. Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic pit and then an otic vesicle. This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the third}} week of development, the embryo is a three-layered disc, covered with ectoderm, <b>mesoderm</b> and endoderm. A tube-like {{formation}} develops in the midline, called the notochord. The notochord releases extracellular molecules that affect the transformation of the overlying ectoderm into nervous tissue. The neural tube, forming from the ectoderm, contains CSF prior {{to the development of the}} choroid plexuses. The open neuropores of the neural tube close after the first month of development, and CSF pressure gradually increases.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the eggs}} {{is a mixture of}} deuterostome and protostome characteristics. Early {{divisions}} of the egg are holoblastic (the cells divide completely) and radial (they gradually form a stack of circles). The process is regulative (the fate of each cell depends on interaction with other cells, not on a rigid program in each cell), and experiments that divided early embryos produced complete larvae. <b>Mesoderm</b> is formed from mesenchyme originating from the archenteron.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{composed}} of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the adrenal medulla, which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from <b>mesoderm,</b> whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve {{is derived from}} the first pair of occipital somites, collections of <b>mesoderm</b> that form next to the main axis of an embryo during development. The musculature it supplies develop as the hypoglossal cord from the myotomes of the first four pairs of occipital somites. The nerve is first visible as a series of roots in the fourth week of development, which have formed a single nerve and link to the tongue by the fifth week.|$|E
5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic <b>mesoderm,</b> except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Metazoans are {{multicellular}} organism, {{different groups}} of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, {{both of which are}} present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the <b>mesoderm</b> is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). Calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs, brachiopods and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria. Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (polyps, sea anemones, jellyfish) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as microvilli, cilia, bristles, spines and tubercles.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from <b>mesoderm,</b> and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E
25|$|During the {{segmentation}} of vertebrate embryos, {{waves of}} gene expression sweep across the presomitic <b>mesoderm,</b> the tissue {{from which the}} precursors of the vertebrae (somites) are formed. A new somite is formed upon arrival of a wave at the anterior end of the presomitic <b>mesoderm.</b> In zebrafish, {{it has been shown}} that the shortening of the presomitic <b>mesoderm</b> during segmentation leads to a Doppler effect as the anterior end of the tissue moves into the waves. This Doppler effect contributes to the period of segmentation.|$|E
25|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} proteins {{cause the}} transcription of mRNAs involved in osteogenesis, neurogenesis, and ventral <b>mesoderm</b> specification.|$|E
25|$|Nodal {{causes the}} {{transcription}} of mRNAs involved in {{left and right}} axis specification, <b>mesoderm</b> and endoderm induction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mesoderm</b> {{extends to}} the midventral line for some {{distance}} behind the umbilical cord, and forms {{the lower part of}} the abdominal wall; it ends below in a prominent swelling, the cloacal tubercle, which after the separation of the rectum becomes the genital tubercle. Dorsally to this tubercle the sides aren't really fused. Rather, the urogenital part of the cloacal membrane separates the ingrowing sheets of <b>mesoderm.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wnt {{signaling}} and beta-catenin dependent {{gene expression}} plays {{a critical role}} during the formation of different body regions in the early embryo. Experimentally modified embryos that do not express this protein will fail to develop <b>mesoderm</b> and initiate gastrulation. During the blastula and gastrula stages, Wnt as well as BMP and FGF pathways will induce the antero-posterior axis formation, regulate the precise placement of the primitive streak (gastrulation and <b>mesoderm</b> formation) {{as well as the}} process of neurulation (central nervous system development).|$|E
25|$|All {{chordates}} are coelomates, {{and have}} a fluid filled body cavity called a coelom with a complete lining called peritoneum derived from <b>mesoderm</b> (see Brusca and Brusca).|$|E
25|$|First, {{extracellular}} signaling molecules, secreted {{from the}} adjacent epidermis and underlying <b>mesoderm</b> such as Wnts, BMPs and Fgfs separate the non-neural ectoderm (epidermis) from the neural plate during neural induction.|$|E
25|$|Lymphatic tissues {{begin to}} develop {{by the end of}} the fifth week of {{embryonic}} development. Lymphatic vessels develop from lymph sacs that arise from developing veins, which are derived from <b>mesoderm.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{mammalian}} kidney develops from intermediate <b>mesoderm.</b> Kidney development, {{also called}} nephrogenesis, proceeds {{through a series}} of three successive developmental phases: the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros. The metanephros are primordia of the permanent kidney.|$|E
25|$|The Notch {{signaling}} pathway {{plays an important}} role in cell-cell communication, and further regulates embryonic development. Early studies in C. elegans indicate that Notch signaling has a major role in the induction of <b>mesoderm</b> and cell fate determination.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspensory}} {{muscle is}} an important anatomical landmark which shows the formal division between the duodenum and the jejunum, {{the first and second}} parts of the small intestine, respectively. This is a thin muscle which is derived from the embryonic <b>mesoderm.</b>|$|E
25|$|The embryo {{undergoes}} well-characterized morphogenetic movements during gastrulation {{and early}} development, including germ-band extension, formation of several furrows, ventral invagination of the <b>mesoderm,</b> and posterior and anterior invagination of endoderm (gut), {{as well as}} extensive body segmentation until finally hatching from the surrounding cuticle into a first-instar larva.|$|E
25|$|The human {{inner ear}} {{develops}} during week 4 of embryonic development from the auditory placode, a thickening of the ectoderm which {{gives rise to}} the bipolar neurons of the cochlear and vestibular ganglions. As the auditory placode invaginates towards the embryonic <b>mesoderm,</b> it forms the auditory vesicle or otocyst.|$|E
25|$|Teratoma formation: iPSCs {{injected}} into immunodeficient mice spontaneously formed teratomas after nine weeks. Teratomas are tumors of multiple lineages containing tissue {{derived from the}} three germ layers endoderm, <b>mesoderm</b> and ectoderm; this is unlike other tumors, which typically are of only one cell type. Teratoma formation is a landmark test for pluripotency.|$|E
25|$|The {{central part}} of {{cardiogenic}} area {{is in front of}} the oropharyngeal membrane and the neural plate. The growth of the brain and the cephalic folds push the oropharyngeal membrane forward, while the heart and the pericardial cavity move first to the cervical region and then into the chest. The curved portion of the horseshoe-shaped area expands to form the future ventricular infundibulum and the ventricular regions, as the heart tube continues to expand. The tube starts receiving venous drainage in its caudal pole and will pump blood out of the first aortic arch and into the dorsal aorta through its polar head. Initially the tube remains attached to the dorsal part of the pericardial cavity by a mesodermal tissue fold called the dorsal <b>mesoderm.</b> This <b>mesoderm</b> disappears to form the two pericardial sinuses the transverse and the oblique pericardial sinuses, which connect both sides of the pericardial cavity.|$|E
25|$|Each vesicle {{forms as}} an outpocketing {{of the wall}} of the ampulla of one vas deferens. The seminal vesicles develop as one of three {{structures}} of the male reproductive system that develops at the junction between the urethra and vas deferens. The vas deferens is derived from the mesonephric duct, a structure that develops from <b>mesoderm.</b>|$|E
25|$|The thyomocytes and the {{epithelium}} of the thymus {{have different}} developmental origins. The epithelium of the thymus develops first, appearing as two flask-shape endodermal diverticula, which arise one on either side, {{from the third}} pharyngeal pouch, and extend outward and backward into the surrounding <b>mesoderm</b> and neural crest-derived mesenchyme {{in front of the}} ventral aorta.|$|E
25|$|Although proneural genes {{operate in}} the ectoderm, lethal of scute acts in the somatic <b>mesoderm</b> to define cell cluster from which muscle {{progenitors}} will be single out. The interaction between these cells and ectoderm, leads {{to the formation of}} muscle founder cells, in an analogous process to the one that occurs in the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Following amputation, most annelids {{are capable}} of sealing their body via rapid muscular contraction. Constriction of body muscle can lead to {{infection}} prevention. In certain species, like Limnodrilus, autolysis can be seen within hours after amputation in the ectoderm and <b>mesoderm.</b> Amputation is also thought to cause a large migration of cells to the injury site, and these form a wound plug.|$|E
25|$|During {{the stage}} of neural plate {{formation}} the embryo consists of three cell layers: the ectoderm that eventually forms the skin and neural tissues, the <b>mesoderm</b> that forms muscle and bone, and the endoderm that will form the cells lining the digestive and respiratory tracts. The progenitor cells {{that make up the}} precursors to neural tissues in the neural plate are called neuroepithelial cells.|$|E
25|$|Both chordin and noggin are antagonists of BMPs. They bind BMPs {{preventing}} the binding of the ligand to the receptor. It {{has been demonstrated}} that Chordin and Noggin dorsalize <b>mesoderm.</b> They are both found in the dorsal lip of Xenopus and convert otherwise epidermis specified tissue into neural tissue (see neurulation). Noggin {{plays a key role}} in cartilage and bone patterning. Mice Noggin-/- have excess cartilage and lacked joint formation.|$|E
25|$|The {{reproductive}} organs are {{developed from the}} intermediate <b>mesoderm.</b> The permanent organs of the adult are preceded {{by a set of}} structures which are purely embryonic, and which {{with the exception of the}} ducts disappear almost entirely before the end of fetal life. These embryonic structures are the Wolffian and MÃ¼llerian ducts, also known as mesonephric and paramesonephric ducts, respectively. The Wolffian duct remains as the duct in males, and the MÃ¼llerian as that of the female.|$|E
