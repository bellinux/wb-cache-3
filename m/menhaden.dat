5|$|Adult and {{juvenile}} finetooth sharks form large schools. This energetic, fast-moving predator feeds mainly on small bony fishes, often entering the surf zone {{during the day}} to hunt. The most important prey of this species in the northwestern Atlantic is the Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> (Brevoortia tyrannus), with sharks of all ages off northwestern Florida eat almost nothing else. The <b>menhaden</b> are swallowed whole after the head has been removed. Other known prey species include spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), mullet (Mugil spp.), shrimp, and in one case a juvenile Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), {{which may have been}} scavenged from the bycatch discard of a shrimp trawler. The finetooth shark may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworm Triloculatum geeceearelensis, and unidentified species in the genera Anthobothrium, Paraorygmatobothrium, and Phoreiobothrium.|$|E
5|$|Plankton support {{marine life}} {{including}} oysters, shrimp and other invertebrates, and bait-fish species including <b>menhaden</b> and mullet, {{which in turn}} support larger fish and mammal species that populate the local waterways. Popular sport fish in the Hilton Head Island area include the red drum (or spot tail bass), spotted sea trout, sheepshead, cobia, tarpon, and various shark species.|$|E
5|$|The finetooth shark (Carcharhinus isodon) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, found in the western Atlantic Ocean, from North Carolina to Brazil. It forms large schools in shallow, coastal waters, and migrates {{seasonally}} following warm water. A relatively small, slender-bodied shark, the finetooth shark can be identified by its needle-like teeth, dark blue-gray dorsal coloration, and long gill slits. It attains a maximum length of 1.9m (6.2ft). The diet of this species consists primarily of small bony fishes, in particular <b>menhaden.</b> Like other members of its family, it is viviparous with females giving birth to two to six pups in estuarine nursery areas every other year.|$|E
50|$|The shads are pelagic (open water) {{schooling}} fish, {{of which}} many are anadromous or even landlocked. Several species are of commercial importance, e.g. in the genus Alosa (river herrings), Brevoortia (<b>menhadens),</b> and Hilsa.|$|R

5|$|The fish is carnivorous, {{with its}} prey {{consisting}} mainly of benthic invertebrates and fishes. Such food items include polychaetes, gastropods, bivalve mollusks, rock crabs, cancer crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, shrimps, squids, and fishes including spiny dogfish, alewife, Atlantic herring, <b>menhaden,</b> hakes, sculpins, cunner, tautog, sand lance, butterfish, and various flounders. Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids. Individuals {{have been found}} with the denticles on the snout worn smooth, indicating that the snout is used to dig in the mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.|$|E
5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf <b>menhaden</b> (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds' feeding {{habits are}} pelagic, {{and they may}} forage up to 500km (310mi) from land. They do not land on the water but snatch prey from the ocean surface using their long, hooked bills. They mainly catch small fish such as flying fish, {{particularly}} the genera Exocoetus and Cypselurus, that are driven to the surface by predators such as tuna and dolphinfish, but they will also eat cephalopods, particularly squid. <b>Menhaden</b> of the genus Brevoortia {{can be an important}} prey item where common, and jellyfish and larger plankton are also eaten. Frigatebirds have learned to follow fishing vessels and take fish from holding areas. Conversely tuna fishermen fish in areas where they catch sight of frigatebirds due to their association with large marine predators. Frigatebirds also at times prey directly on eggs and young of other seabirds, including boobies, petrels, shearwaters and terns, in particular the sooty tern.|$|E
25|$|The {{species of}} Clupea {{belong to the}} larger family Clupeidae (herrings, shads, sardines, <b>menhadens),</b> which {{comprises}} some 200 species that share similar features. These silvery-coloured fish have a single dorsal fin, which is soft, without spines. They have no lateral line and have a protruding lower jaw. Their size varies between subspecies: the Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras) is small, 14 to 18cm; the proper Atlantic herring (C. h. harengus) can grow to about 46cm (18in) and weigh up 700 g (1.5lb); and Pacific herring grow to about 38cm (15in).|$|R
50|$|Clupeidae is {{a family}} of ray-finned fishes, comprising, for instance, the herrings, shads, sardines, hilsa, and <b>menhadens.</b> The {{clupeids}} include {{many of the most}} important food fishes in the world, and are also commonly caught for production of fish oil and fish meal. Many members of the family have a body protected with shiny cycloid scales (very smooth and uniform scales), a single dorsal fin, with a fusiform body for quick, evasive swimming and pursuit of prey composed of small planktonic animals. Due to their small size, and position in the lower trophic level of many marine food webs, the levels of methylmercury they bioaccumulate are very low, reducing the risk of mercury poisoning when consumed.|$|R

25|$|Typical ocean {{forage fish}} are small, silvery {{schooling}} oily fish such as herring, anchovies and <b>menhaden,</b> and other small, schooling baitfish like capelin, smelts, sand lance, halfbeaks, pollock, butterfish and juvenile rockfish. Herrings are a preeminent forage fish, often marketed as sardines or pilchards.|$|E
25|$|Maryland {{has a large}} food-production sector. A large {{component}} of this is commercial fishing, centered in the Chesapeake Bay, but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast. The largest catches by species are the blue crab, oysters, striped bass, and <b>menhaden.</b> The Bay also has overwintering waterfowl in its wildlife refuges. The waterfowl support a tourism sector of sportsmen.|$|E
25|$|Forage fish, {{also called}} prey fish or bait fish, are small pelagic fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed {{near the base}} of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include {{particularly}} fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, <b>menhaden,</b> anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right.|$|E

25|$|Most filter-feeding {{pelagic fish}} found in coastal waters are small, silvery forage fish. Forage fish include fishes {{of the family}} Clupeidae (herrings, shad, {{sardines}} and pilchards, hilsa, <b>menhaden</b> and sprats), as well as anchovies, capelin and halfbeaks. They use schooling strategies to avoid predators, and different schools of forage fish often associate {{with each other in}} open coastal waters. Forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton and fry (recently hatched fish), often by filter feeding. In turn, they are preyed on by larger predatory fish, seabirds and marine mammals.|$|E
25|$|Forage {{fish are}} small fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish are small, filter-feeding fish such as herring, {{anchovies}} and <b>menhaden.</b> Forage fish compensate for their small size by forming schools. Some swim in synchronised grids with their mouths open {{so they can}} efficiently filter feed on plankton. These schools can become huge, moving along coastlines and migrating across open oceans. The shoals are concentrated food resources for the great marine predators.|$|E
25|$|Wharton {{traveled}} {{widely and}} {{became involved in}} many industrial enterprises such as mines, factories and railroads. He started several enterprises on the South New Jersey property, including a <b>menhaden</b> fish factory that produced oil and fertilizer, a modern forestry planting operation, and cranberry and sugar beet farms. Wharton also purchased land containing ore and an iron furnace in northern New Jersey at Port Oram, New Jersey (now Wharton, New Jersey) which was located close to the Morris Canal and railroads. He purchased a coal mine in western Pennsylvania, constructing for the workers a town of 85 houses and stores along the railway. He also purchased coal land in West Virginia, iron and copper mines in Michigan, and gold mines in Arizona and Nevada. Wharton {{became involved in the}} Reading and Lehigh railroads and several others, arranging spur lines with the railroads to carry ore and finished metal products. He maintained an extensive business correspondence and in later life maintained this practice through his vacations. Wharton was a colleague of leaders such as inventors Ezra Cornell, Elias Howe and Thomas Edison, and entrepreneur Cornelius Vanderbilt. His management style evolved throughout {{the latter half of the}} 1800s, making use of new technology for communication, transportation, and production, so that he controlled many industries profitably on a larger scale than was previously possible.|$|E

Other marine stations maintained by Florida State University until 1954 included one at Mayport, on the St. Johns River near Jacksonville, which conducted research related to the <b>menhaden</b> and shrimp fisheries and oceanographic problems of the Gulf Stream and {{the mouth of the}} St. John's River, and one on Mullet Key at the mouth of Tampa Bay, which studied red tide.|$|E
500|$|This alcid {{typically}} fed in shoaling {{waters that}} were shallower than those frequented by other alcids, although after the breeding season, {{they had been}} sighted as far as [...] from land. They {{are believed to have}} fed cooperatively in flocks. Their main food was fish, usually [...] in length and weighing , but occasionally their prey was up to half the bird's own length. Based on remains associated with great auk bones found on Funk Island and on ecological and morphological considerations, it seems that Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> and capelin were their favoured prey. Other fish suggested as potential prey include lumpsuckers, shorthorn sculpins, cod, sand lance, as well as crustaceans. The young of the great auk are believed to have eaten plankton and, possibly, fish and crustaceans regurgitated by adults.|$|E
500|$|The {{brown pelican}} usually plunge-dives head-first for its prey, from a height {{as great as}} , {{especially}} for anchovies and <b>menhaden.</b> The only other pelican to feed using a similar technique is the Peruvian pelican, but its dives are typically from a lower height than the brown pelican. The Australian and American white pelicans may feed by low plunge-dives landing feet-first and then scooping up the prey with the beak, but they—as well as the remaining pelican species—primarily feed while swimming on the water. Aquatic prey is most commonly taken {{at or near the}} water surface. Although principally a fish eater, the Australian pelican is also an eclectic and opportunistic scavenger and carnivore that forages in landfill sites as well as taking carrion and [...] "anything from insects and small crustaceans to ducks and small dogs". Food is not stored in a pelican's throat pouch, contrary to popular folklore.|$|E
500|$|The {{great auk}} was [...] tall and weighed about , {{making it the}} second-largest member of the alcid family (Miomancalla was larger). It had a black back and a white belly. The black beak was heavy and hooked, with grooves on its surface. During summer, great auk plumage showed a white patch over each eye. During winter, the great auk lost these patches, instead {{developing}} a white band stretching between the eyes. The wings were only [...] long, rendering the bird flightless. Instead, the great auk was a powerful swimmer, a trait that it used in hunting. Its favourite prey were fish, including Atlantic <b>menhaden</b> and capelin, and crustaceans. Although agile in the water, it was clumsy on land. Great auk pairs mated for life. They nested in extremely dense and social colonies, laying one egg on bare rock. The egg was white with variable brown marbling. Both parents participated in the incubation of the egg for around 6 weeks before the young hatched. The young left the nest site after 2-3 weeks, although the parents continued to care for it.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an earlier}} time, one person had {{described}} the transparency of the water: [...] "I remember the time, gentlemen, {{when you could}} go in twelve feet of water {{and you could see}} the pebbles on the bottom of this river." [...] As the water got more polluted, it darkened, underwater vegetation (such as photosynthesizing seagrass) began dying, and as the seagrass beds declined, the many associated species of their ecosystems declined as well, contributing to the decline of the river. Also harmful was the general destruction of the once plentiful oyster beds in the waters around the city, and the over-fishing of <b>menhaden,</b> or mossbunker, a small silvery fish which had been used since the time of the Native Americans for fertilizing crops - however it took 8,000 of these schooling fish to fertilize a single acre, so mechanized fishing using the purse seine was developed, and eventually the <b>menhaden</b> population collapsed. [...] <b>Menhaden</b> feed on phytoplankton, helping to keep them in check, and are also a vital step in the food chain, as bluefish, striped bass and other fish species which do not eat phytoplankton feed on the <b>menhaden.</b> [...] The oyster is another filter feeder: oysters purify 10 to 100 gallons a day, while each <b>menhaden</b> filters four gallons in a minute, and their schools were immense: one report had a farmer collecting 20 oxcarts worth of <b>menhaden</b> using simple fishing nets deployed from the shore. [...] The combination of more sewage, due to the availability of more potable water [...] New York's water consumption per capita was twice that of Europe [...] indoor plumbing, the destruction of filter feeders, and the collapse of the food chain, damaged the ecosystem of the waters around New York, including the East River, almost beyond repair.|$|E
2500|$|Franklin's {{research}} about a lesser {{fish in the}} food chain called the <b>menhaden</b> brought greater attention to their survival. In The Most Important Fish in the Sea, Franklin examined marine food chains and argued {{for the importance of}} <b>menhaden.</b> He showed that many species of fish, which humans eat, depend for their well-being on eating <b>menhaden,</b> and therefore their role in the food chain was vital. Franklin's analysis was an interdisciplinary study in American environmental, economic, social, political, and cultural history from the 17th into the 21st centuries. It led to the introduction of two nature conservation bills in Congress. In a review in The Washington Post, his book was described as an [...] "exhaustive examination of issues" [...] using lucid prose [...] "infused with an urgency that depends little on hyperbole and largely on careful documentation".|$|E
2500|$|Shanties {{have also}} been {{well-documented}} in use for tasks other {{than those of the}} deep-water sailor. The working of cargo was performed by stevedores to the accompaniment of shanties, for example {{in the tradition of the}} Georgia Sea Island Singers of St. Simons Island, Georgia. They used such shanties as [...] "Knock a Man Down" [...] (a variation of [...] "Blow the Man Down") to load heavy timber. The category of <b>menhaden</b> chanties refers to work songs used on <b>menhaden</b> fishing boats, sung while pulling up the purse-seine nets. The musical forms, and consequently the repertoire, of <b>menhaden</b> chanties differ significantly from the deep-water shanties, most noticeably in the fact that the workers [...] "pull" [...] in between rather than concurrently with certain words of the songs. Common examples are [...] "The Johnson Girls" [...] and [...] "Won't You Help Me to Raise 'Em Boys." [...] Off-shore whalermen in parts of the Caribbean sang shanties whilst rowing their whaleboats and when hauling their catch onto land.|$|E
2500|$|The Chesapeake Bay {{is home to}} {{numerous}} fauna that either migrate to the Bay {{at some point during}} the year or live there year-round. [...] There are over 300 species of fish and numerous shellfish and crab species. Some of these include the Atlantic <b>menhaden,</b> striped bass, American eel, eastern oyster, and the blue crab.|$|E
2500|$|Pfiesteria is a genus of {{heterotrophic}} dinoflagellates {{that has}} been associated with harmful algal blooms and fish kills. [...] Research suggests that Pfiesteria behaves as an ambush predator and utilizes a [...] "hit and run" [...] feeding strategy by releasing a toxin that paralyses the respiratory systems of susceptible fish, such as <b>menhaden,</b> thus causing death by suffocation. It then consumes the tissue sloughed off its dead prey.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crevalle jack}} {{is a popular}} and highly {{regarded}} gamefish throughout its range, with the recreational catch of the species often exceeding commercial catches. The only amateur catch data available are from the US, which has an annual catch of around 400 to 1000 tonnes per year. In Trinidad, the species {{is the basis for}} several fishing tournaments. Crevalle jack are targeted from boats, as well as from piers and rockwalls by land based anglers. Fishermen often target regions where depth suddenly changes, such as channels, holes, reefs or ledges, with strong currents and eddies favourable. The fish take both live and cut baits, as well as a variety of artificial lures; however, when the fish are in feeding mode, they rarely refuse anything they are offered. Popular baits include both live fish, such as mullet and <b>menhaden,</b> as well as dead or strip baits consisting of fish, squid or prawns. Crevalle jack readily accept any style of lure, including hard-bodied spoons, jigs, plugs and poppers, as well as flies and soft rubber lures. There is some evidence based on long term observations that the species favours yellow [...] lures over all others. Tackle is often kept quite light, but heavy monofilament leaders are employed to prevent the fish's teeth from abrading the line. Crevalle jack are generally considered quite poor table fare, with selection of younger fish and bleeding upon capture giving the best results. The flesh is very red and dark due to the red muscle of the fish, which makes it somewhat coarse and poor tasting. When pulled from the water, this fish snorts in what many people describe as [...] "a pig-like" [...] fashion. The crevalle jack has been implicated in several cases of ciguatera poisoning, although appears less likely to be a carrier than the horse-eye jack.|$|E
60|$|Let every angler {{who loves}} to fish think {{what it would mean}} to him to find the fish were gone. The {{mackerel}} are gone, the bluefish are going, the <b>menhaden</b> are gone, every year the amberjack and kingfish grow smaller and fewer. We must find ways and means to save our game fish of the sea; and one of the finest and most sportsman-like ways is to use light tackle.|$|E
60|$|Doctor Fleming {{found the}} remains of sepias in its stomach, and also small fishes. Oppian stated that it eagerly devours the Hippuris (probably Coryphæna). A {{specimen}} taken off Saconnet July 22, 1875, had in its stomach {{the remains of}} small fish, perhaps Stromateus triacanthus, and jaws of a squid, perhaps Loligo pealin. Their food in the western Atlantic consists {{for the most part}} of the common schooling species of fishes. They feed on <b>menhaden,</b> mackerel, bonitoes, bluefish, and other species which swim in close schools. Their habits of feeding have often been described to me by old fishermen. They are said to rise beneath the school of small fish, striking to the right and left with their swords until they have killed a number, which they then proceed to devour. <b>Menhaden</b> have been seen floating at the surface which have been cut nearly in twain by a blow of a sword. Mr. John H. Thompson remarks that he has seen them apparently throw the fish in the air, catching them on the fall.|$|E
