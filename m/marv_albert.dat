50|$|During the club's ABA years, announcers {{included}} Marty Glickman, <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert's</b> brothers Al Albert and Steve Albert, baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson, Bob Goldsholl, {{as well as}} Sterling and DiTomasso. The {{latter two}} joined the club's move into the NBA.|$|R
50|$|Albert {{hails from}} a family of broadcasters. His brothers, <b>Marv</b> and Steve <b>Albert,</b> and a nephew, Kenny, are also play-by-play sports commentators.|$|R
25|$|Jimmy Cefalo {{hosted the}} pregame show for Game 4 of the 1989 ALCS as <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> was away on an NFL {{assignment}} for NBC.|$|E
25|$|<b>Marv</b> <b>Albert,</b> and John Davidson {{called the}} action, while Mike Emrick {{served as an}} ice-level {{reporter}} in 1990. Meanwhile, Bill Clement served as an ice-level reporter in 1991, 1992 and 1994.|$|E
25|$|This {{series was}} aired on NBC with <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert,</b> Bob Costas (hosts), Mike Fratello, Magic Johnson, Quinn Buckner (analysts), Ahmad Rashād (Bulls sideline) and Hannah Storm (Suns sideline) (reporters) calling the action.|$|E
50|$|He first {{worked with}} the Knicks as a radio {{announcer}} for WFAN from 1992-97, when {{he was promoted to}} television play-by-play upon <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert's</b> firing following his infamous sex scandal. He later became Albert's backup upon his return in 1999, before finally becoming the lead play-by-play upon Albert's second dismissal in 2004. On February 8, 2006, with the departure of Al Michaels from the network, ABC announced that Breen would take over as the lead broadcaster for the NBA, including the NBA Finals. His broadcasting career started doing play-by-play for the Marist College Red Foxes basketball team in 1985. Other than his role as ABC's main play-by-play on Sundays, Breen usually works for ESPN on Fridays, and occasionally on Wednesdays, {{with the rest of his}} schedule reserved for MSG. He has also called college basketball games for ESPN.|$|R
50|$|Dolan rarely {{speaks with}} members of the media and {{communicates}} to the press through released statements or in interviews with MSG Network. In 2000, Dolan instituted media training for all Garden employees who might deal with the press and instituted an ironclad rule against team personnel criticizing others in the organization via the media. Under Dolan's watch MSG implemented controversial media policies limiting access to players. Some of these measures included prohibiting reporters and Knicks' beat writers from interviewing players without an MSG public relations official present, forbidding one-on-one interviews, and excommunicating writers who write articles critical of the organization. The policies also forbid the MSG Network from being critical of the Knicks and the Rangers, regardless of their performance. Such measures were not standard practice for other NBA teams. In addition, the Knicks did not make their medical staff available to the press. In 2004, longtime broadcaster <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert's</b> contract was not renewed by MSG Network, allegedly because of his criticism of the Knicks' play.|$|R
25|$|Announcers: For NBC, Mike Breen {{announced}} Game 1, <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> Games 3-7; Bill Walton & Steve Jones {{joined them}} as the analysts. TNT had Kevin Harlan, Danny Ainge, & John Thompson on hand for Game 2.|$|E
25|$|On radio, Westwood One had the {{national}} broadcast {{rights to the}} game in the United States and Canada; <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> and Boomer Esiason served as the announcing team for that network. The game was carried on BBC Radio 5 Live in the United Kingdom with Arlo White commentating.|$|E
25|$|Westwood One {{carried the}} game {{nationwide}} over terrestrial radio with <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> on play-by-play and Boomer Esiason on color commentary, with Jim Gray hosting the pregame and halftime shows. Locally, Gil Santos and Gino Cappelletti called {{the game for}} the Patriots and Bill Rosinski and Eugene Robinson served that position for the Panthers.|$|E
25|$|While {{filling in}} for an injured Steve Kerr on a Los Angeles Lakers-Sacramento Kings broadcast, Charles Barkley made disparaging {{comments}} {{about the age of}} referee Dick Bavetta. The conversation between Barkley and play-by-play man <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> eventually led him to comment that he could outrun Bavetta, and any other man of his age (Bavetta was 67 at the time).|$|E
25|$|TNT's lead announcing {{teams for}} the NBA Playoffs were <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> with Reggie Miller and Kevin Harlan with Doug Collins. Play-by-play announcers Dick Stockton and Matt Devlin was also teamed with Mike Fratello and Los Angeles Clippers head coach Mike Dunleavy on a {{rotating}} basis. Sideline reporters include Craig Sager, Cheryl Miller, Pam Oliver, David Aldridge, Marty Snider, Dei Lynam, and Stephanie Ready.|$|E
25|$|Commentators {{included}} Fred Manfra on play-by-play and Oscar Robertson (from 1984–85 through 1985–86), Dick Vitale (from 1986–87 through 1989-90) and Earl Monroe (from 1988–89 through 1989-90) on color commentary. Other announcers included <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> (1989 All-Star Game) and Chick Hearn (1988 All-Star Game) on play-by-play and Rod Hundley (1987 and 1989 All-Star Games), Johnny Most (1988 All-Star Game), and Dave Barnett (1986 All-Star Game) on color commentary.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his work on telecasts of the NBA, Sager reported for TNT at the 1999 Tournament of the Americas Olympic Qualifying Basketball Tournament in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the 2000 USA Basketball Games, and the 2002 World Championships of Basketball. Sager {{also served as a}} sideline reporter for the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, both for Turner Sports and CBS with <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert,</b> Chris Webber, and Len Elmore.|$|E
25|$|Jay Randolph, who {{was also}} the sports {{director}} for St. Louis NBC affiliate KSDK, interviewed the winners in the St. Louis Cardinals' clubhouse following their Game 7 victory. Also following Game 7, NBC's <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> interviewed 1987 NLCS MVP, Jeffrey Leonard of the San Francisco Giants (to date, the last person from the losing team to win a postseason series Most Valuable Player Award, either League Championship Series or World Series).|$|E
25|$|NBC used Don Sutton as a pre- and post-game {{analyst for}} their 1987 LCS coverage. Sutton also made an {{appearance}} in the booth during Game 3 of the ALCS. Sutton talked with Bob Costas and Tony Kubek about Twins pitcher Les Straker's borderline balk in that game. Sutton later interviewed Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson following their loss in Game 5. Meanwhile, <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> went back-and-forth during both 1987 LCS. He hosted the pregame for Game 1 of the NLCS with Joe Morgan, and in fact had to read the lineups to the viewing audience. There {{was a problem with}} the P.A. feed at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis, so he ended up reading the script from the Cardinal dugout while the players were introduced to the crowd. He then went to Minneapolis the next night to host the ALCS pregame with Don Sutton at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Jimmy Cefalo hosted the pregame coverage for Game 5 of the NLCS, as <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> was away on a boxing assignment for NBC.|$|E
25|$|The 2000–2001 season {{brought to}} an end to Bob Costas' direct role with the NBA on NBC (although Costas would work playoff games {{for the next two}} seasons and would return to host NBC's {{coverage}} for the 2002 NBA Finals). Costas deferred to <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert,</b> allowing Albert to again be the lead broadcaster for the NBA, and stayed on only to deliver interviews and special features. On the studio front, Hannah Storm left her position as studio host to go on maternity leave, with Ahmad Rashād taking over for Storm; Isiah Thomas left NBC to become coach of the Indiana Pacers. Joining Ahmad Rashād were former Phoenix Suns player Kevin Johnson and former NBA coach P. J. Carlesimo. <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> joined Doug Collins as the primary broadcast team, and the two broadcast the 2001 NBA Finals, which had the highest ratings for a Finals match since 1998. After the season, Collins was hired away from NBC by the Washington Wizards, which forced the network to move the longtime secondary color duo of Steve Jones and Bill Walton to the lead broadcast team with Albert.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days before}} NBC {{was to begin}} its playoff coverage, both <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> and Mike Fratello, {{returning}} from working a Philadelphia 76ers–Indiana Pacers game on TNT, were seriously injured in a limousine accident. That week, NBC juggled its announcing teams, which resulted in Bob Costas and Paul Sunderland working some early-round playoff games. Fratello would return to TNT after several days, and Albert returned to NBC for Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and Sacramento Kings.|$|E
25|$|Also as {{previously}} mentioned, longtime Los Angeles Dodgers' broadcaster Vin Scully called the 1988 World Series {{for a national}} television audience on NBC with Joe Garagiola. Unknown to the fans and the media at the time, Kirk Gibson was watching the game on television while undergoing physical therapy in the Dodgers' clubhouse. At {{some point during the}} game, television cameras scanned the Dodgers dugout and Scully, observed that Gibson was nowhere to be found. This spurred Gibson to tell Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda that he was available to pinch hit. Gibson immediately returned to the batting cage in the clubhouse to take practice swings. Bob Costas, who, along with <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert,</b> hosted NBC's World Series pre-game coverage and handled post-game interviews, made on-air statements that enraged many in the Dodgers' clubhouse (especially Tommy Lasorda). After the Dodgers won Game 4, Lasorda (during a post-game interview with <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert)</b> sarcastically said that the MVP of the World Series should be Bob Costas. While Kirk Gibson was taking practice swings in the Dodgers' clubhouse during Game 1, Orel Hershiser set up the hitting tee for his teammate. Along the way, Costas could hear Gibson's agonized-sounding grunts after every hit. Costas said that the 1988 Dodgers possibly had the weakest hitting line-up in World Series history.|$|E
25|$|Many sportswriters {{and sports}} media analysts praised Breen, some for his {{explosive}} voice and excited calls on game-deciding and game-winning shots {{and others for}} the fact that, unlike his predecessor Al Michaels, he was already very familiar with broadcasting basketball games and was essentially a basketball lifer. Despite that, he faced some criticism from those who complained that they would prefer a more established voice, such as <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> or Kevin Harlan. Hubie Brown faced criticism from writers (most notably Richard Sandomir of The New York Times) as well as bloggers and viewers.|$|E
25|$|Amy {{goes out}} {{drinking}} with her co-workers, including an intern, who invites {{her back to}} his place; their bizarre sexual encounter is interrupted when his mom enters and reveals that he is only 16. The next day, Dianna fires Amy for the incident. Aaron is moping in his apartment until LeBron calls, claiming he has been injured. Aaron rushes over to find an intervention for him consisting of LeBron, Matthew Broderick, Chris Evert, and <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert.</b> They tell him {{he has always been}} afraid of opening up and needs to make things right with Amy, but Aaron insists things with Amy are over.|$|E
25|$|The Giants' {{longtime}} radio {{home was}} WNEW, where games aired from the mid-1950s until 1993 when {{the station was}} bought by Bloomberg L.P. and changed its format. Marty Glickman teamed with Al DeRogatis for a long stretch {{beginning in the early}} 1960s on WNEW. Chip Cipolla and later Sam Huff joined Glickman after DeRogatis left to join Curt Gowdy on NBC. After the WNEW split, games began airing on WOR. Glickman moved to the crosstown Jets in 1973 and was succeeded by <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert.</b> Jim Gordon succeeded Albert in 1977, beginning an 18-year tenure as the Giants' play-by-play voice. Meanwhile, Dick Lynch took over as color analyst in 1976 and continued in that role through 2007, with his last game being Super Bowl XLII, and retired following the season due to his advancing leukemia, which took his life in September 2008.|$|E
25|$|<b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> was {{the lead}} play-by-play {{broadcaster}} for the NBA on NBC {{for most of its}} run from 1990 to 2002, calling every NBA Finals during that timeframe except for 1998, 1999, and 2000. During this time, Bob Costas had taken over the lead job and called the Finals after Marv's arrest for sexual assault had brought him national disgrace. Marv resumed his previous position for the 2000–2001 season and called Game 4 of the 2002 NBA Finals which was the final NBA telecast on NBC. During his time on NBC, Albert continued as lead play-by-play man for the New York Knicks on local MSG Network telecasts and began calling national games for TNT in 1999 as well. When he regained the lead broadcaster position on NBC, he continued to call play-by-play for both networks until the end of NBC's coverage in 2002.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} {{broadcast}} in the United States by NBC with Dick Enberg handling the play-by-play duties and color commentator Merlin Olsen {{in the broadcast}} booth. This would be Olsen's final Super Bowl broadcast, as he was demoted the following season {{to make room for}} retiring 49ers head coach Bill Walsh. Bob Costas along with Gayle Gardner hosted the Super Bowl Live! pregame (2 hours), halftime, and postgame coverage with analysts Paul Maguire and then-Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula. Also assisting with NBC's coverage were pregame roving reporter Jim Gray (who was also working as a researcher for NBC Sports at the time) and <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert,</b> who interviewed Sam Wyche and Boomer Esiason after the game. Meanwhile, during NBC's pregame coverage, Ahmad Rashād and John Candy hosted the Diet Pepsi Talent Challenge at the Miami Seaquarium. Also, Frank Deford delivered a special segment profiling recently deceased Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney.|$|E
25|$|Broadcasters from CBS, TBS, and TNT's sports {{coverage}} are shared across all four networks, with CBS' college basketball teams supplemented with Turner's NBA teams, while studio segments {{take place at}} the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City and Turner's studios in Atlanta. In the New York-based studio shows, CBS' Greg Gumbel and Clark Kellogg are joined by Ernie Johnson, Jr., Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley of TNT's Inside the NBA while Seth Davis of CBS assists with Matt Winer and various NBA TV personalities. While Turner's primary NBA voices, <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> and Kevin Harlan, are already employed by CBS in other capacities, they also lend analysts Chris Webber, Grant Hill, and Reggie Miller and secondary play-by-play man Brian Anderson to CBS. In turn, CBS announcers Jim Nantz, Brad Nessler, Spero Dedes, and Andrew Catalon appear on Turner network broadcasts along with analysts Len Elmore, Bill Raftery, Dan Bonner, Mike Gminski, and Doug Gottlieb.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{represented}} the United States at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games, where {{he won the}} silver medal. He dominated his opponents, never losing a single round {{en route to the}} final. His participation in the final was met with controversy when he lost a 3–2 decision to South Korean fighter Park Si-Hun despite pummeling Park for three rounds, landing 86 punches to Park's 32. Allegedly, Park himself apologized to Jones afterward and the referee told Jones that he was dumbstruck by the judges' decision. One judge shortly thereafter admitted the decision was a mistake and all three judges voting against Jones were eventually suspended. <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert,</b> calling the bout on American television for NBC, reported judges from Hungary and the Soviet Union scored the bout in favor of Jones, while those from Morocco and Uruguay favored Park. The fifth judge, from Uganda, scored the bout as a draw, leaving the outcome to be decided on other criteria.|$|E
500|$|Andy tells Michael he {{is going}} to [...] "get my Lost on", a {{reference}} to the ABC science fiction drama television series. Andy sings The Cranberries' 1994 hit song [...] "Zombie", which was the most annoying song Helms and Krasinski could think of for Andy to sing. Dwight later returns to the office wearing a sweatshirt prominently displaying Battlestar Galactica, a Syfy military science fiction television series. When referring to Andy's weirdness, Michael mentions radio broadcaster <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert,</b> who was convicted of sexual assault in the late 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Joe Namath, Roy Firestone, and Mike Judge guest {{starred in}} the episode. Scully claims that Judge was paid $1,000,000 {{to appear in the}} episode, where he voiced the cameo of Hank Hill. The {{appearance}} was actually a cross-promotion for Judge's animated show King of the Hill which followed The Simpsons on Fox's Sunday schedule in 1997. Other King of the Hill characters (Hank's niece Luanne, Hank's wife Peggy, Hank's son Bobby, and Hank's friends, Dale Gribble, Bill Dauterive, and Boomhauer) were present in the scene, although none of them spoke. <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> was originally going to play Firestone's part as a sports radio host, but was dropped following sexual assault charges that were made against him around the time the episode was in pre-production. Albert would later appear, however, in the season 20 episode [...] "The Burns and The Bees".|$|E
500|$|In 2006–07, James' averages {{declined}} to 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.6 steals per game. Some analysts attributed the fall to a regression in his passing skills and shot selection, {{stemming from a}} lack of effort and focus. The Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the East's second seed. In Game 5 of the Conference Finals, James notched 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, scoring 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including the game-winning layup with two seconds left, against the Pistons. After the game, play-by-play announcer <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> called the performance [...] "one of the greatest moments in postseason history" [...] and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as [...] "Jordan-esque". In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history. The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Finals. During the championship round, James struggled, averaging 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting, and Cleveland was eliminated in a sweep.|$|E
500|$|Since 2000, Barkley {{has served}} as a studio analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT). He appears on the network's NBA {{coverage}} during pre-game and halftime shows, in addition to special NBA events. He also occasionally works as an onsite game analyst. He is part of the crew on Inside the NBA, a post-game show during which Barkley, Ernie Johnson Jr., Kenny Smith and Shaquille O'Neal recap and comment on NBA games that have occurred during the day and also on general NBA affairs. During the broadcast of a game, in which Barkley was courtside with <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert,</b> Barkley poked fun at NBA official Dick Bavetta's age. Albert replied to Barkley, [...] "I believe Dick would beat you in a footrace." [...] In response to that remark, Barkley went on to challenge Bavetta to a race at the 2007 NBA All-Star Weekend for $5,000. The winner was to choose a charity to which the money would be donated. The NBA agreed to pitch in an additional $50,000, and TNT threw in $25,000. The pair raced {{for three and a half}} lengths of the basketball court until Barkley ultimately won. After the event, the two embraced in a show of good sportsmanship.|$|E
500|$|Jordan and the Bulls {{continued}} their {{dominance in the}} 1991–92 season, establishing a 67–15 record, topping their franchise record from 1990–91. Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game on 52% shooting. After winning a physical 7-game series over the New York Knicks {{in the second round}} of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in 6 games, the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals. The media, hoping to recreate a Magic–Bird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between [...] "Air" [...] Jordan and Clyde [...] "The Glide" [...] during the pre-Finals hype. In the first game, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals. After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. <b>Marv</b> <b>Albert,</b> who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying, [...] "I can't believe I'm doing this." [...] The Bulls went on to win Game 1, and defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 53% from the floor.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Marv</b> <b>Albert</b> (born Marvin Philip Aufrichtig; June 12, 1941) is an American sportscaster. Honored for {{his work}} {{as a member of the}} Basketball Hall of Fame, he is {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "the voice of basketball". From 1967 to 2004, he was also known as [...] "the voice of the New York Knicks". Albert currently works for Turner Sports, serving as lead announcer for NBA games on TNT.|$|E
