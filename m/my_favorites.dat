500|$|In 1963 Donen {{made one}} of his most praised films: Charade, {{starring}} Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass. Donen has said that he had [...] "always wanted to make a movie like one of <b>my</b> <b>favorites,</b> Hitchcock's North by Northwest" [...] and the film has been referred to as [...] "the best Hitchcock movie that Hitchcock never made." [...] Charade was produced by Stanley Donen Productions, released through Universal and adapted by Peter Stone from his own novel. Reggie Lampert (Hepburn) discovers that her husband has been murdered and (at least) three sinister men are all searching for the $250,000 in gold that he had hidden somewhere. Peter Joshua (Grant) befriends Reggie and helps her fight off the three thugs while the two begin to fall in love, and in the end no one is quite who they seem to be. The film was released in December 1963, only two weeks after the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy, and the word [...] "assassinate" [...] had to be redubbed twice. It was Donen's most financially successful film and influenced a number of romantic comedy-thrillers released in the years following it. Film critic Judith Crist called it a [...] "stylish and amusing melodrama", and Pauline Kael said it had [...] "a freshness and spirit that makes [...] unlike the films of any other country" [...] and was [...] "probably the best American film of [...] ".

500|$|While Carey paved {{a lot of}} {{the album}} with slower and autobiographical ballads, she also {{attempted}} at making an album with a mixture of several different genres.

But as she tries to regain her audience, her greatest weapon may be her versatility: Ms. Carey also knows how to make a hip-hop hit by holding back and letting the beat shine." [...] Carey decided to work with Just Blaze after she heard the song [...] "Oh Boy" [...] he had produced for Cam'ron.

500|$|Co-director Johnson {{would go}} over each {{scene with the}} animators, {{sometimes}} acting out the scene, if necessary. The animators would create a [...] "dope sheet"—in which a shot was broken down, frame by frame—to account for key [...] "hits". The animators would then shoot tests of the scene, often shooting on [...] "2s" [...] or [...] "4s" [...] (meaning shooting just every second or fourth frame of what would appear in the final animation). Johnson explained: [...] "The next day, when they'd finish their test/rehearsal, we'd cut it in {{and see how it}} played in the reel and fine-tune from there. We might do some lighting tweaks, performance tweaks or have the art department get in and touch anything that needed it. Then we'd close the curtain and let the animator animate the shot." [...] The animators would sometimes make use of the voice and/or video recordings of the actors, a practice also common in cel animation. Once photographed, the frames were manipulated by a team of [...] "data wranglers." [...] Using a workflow developed by Chris Watts, the frames were downloaded from the camera image cards as RAW files, converted to Cineon files and processed through a [...] "color cube." [...] Cinematographer Pete Kozachik explained: [...] "The color cube is a 3D lookup table created by FilmLight Ltd. that forces the image data into behaving like a particular Eastman Kodak film stock—in this case, 5248, one of <b>my</b> <b>favorites.</b> With this film emulation, we could actually rate our cameras at ASA 100, then take our light meters and spot meters and, with great confidence, shoot as if we were using 5248. Sure enough, the footage would come back and look just like it." [...] The frames could be processed further to generate a TIFF file for viewing on the lighting station computer monitors so lighting, composition and color could be previewed.|$|E

[...] "So filled with rubato is Cooke's interpretation that the usually powerful, forward-moving piece nearly comes to a stand-still on several occasions. [...] Chords are played with a tiresome delay at the bottom half that makes Cooke's playing predictable." [...] In 2012, Fanfare Magazine presented a feature article that detailed many of Cooke’s recordings; amongst the reviewers comments: [...] "Not since Bion Tsang and Anton Nel replaced Nancy Green and Frederick Moyer as <b>my</b> <b>favorites</b> in the Brahms cello sonatas (see Fanfare 33:6) have I encountered another recording of these works quite as breathtaking as this new one...," [...] and from the Audio Video Club of America: [...] "I’ve never heard a darker, richer, more passionately conceived cello sound than Cooke cultivates here...."

But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy.
