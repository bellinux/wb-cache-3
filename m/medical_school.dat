5|$|Dartmouth's <b>medical</b> <b>school</b> {{was founded}} in 1797 as the fourth <b>medical</b> <b>school</b> in the United States, {{following}} the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (founded 1765), the <b>medical</b> <b>school</b> of King's College (now Columbia University) (1767), and Harvard <b>Medical</b> <b>School</b> (1782). The founder was Nathan Smith, a Harvard University and University of Edinburgh <b>Medical</b> <b>School</b> educated physician from Cornish, New Hampshire. Noting the dearth of medical professionals in the rural Connecticut River Upper Valley area, Smith petitioned the Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College in August 1796 to fund {{the establishment of a}} <b>medical</b> <b>school</b> to train more physicians for the region. Though Dartmouth College as a whole was financially strapped, the Board approved the request, and Smith began lecturing on November 22, 1797.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, St Thomas's Hospital <b>Medical</b> <b>School</b> {{was granted}} its own {{coat of arms}}. However, the St Thomas' Hospital coat of arms has still been used.

The two medical schools merged in 1982 and became the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals (UMDS). Simon Argles, secretary of UMDS, said {{that because of the}} name of the <b>medical</b> <b>school</b> it was more appropriate to use the hospital's coat of arms.|$|E

40|$|Caribbean {{offshore}} <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> are private, for-profit {{institutions that}} provide medical education to international students, including from the US and Canada, who intend {{to leave the}} region to practice medicine. Offshore <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> are distinct from regional <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> {{because they do not}} principally serve a local population. This offshoring industry contributes to the movement of health workers across international borders, and should considered alongside other global healthcare mobiltiies. This thesis uses three datasets to reveal the narratives that surround offshore <b>medical</b> <b>schools.</b> First, a content analysis of institutional websites shows how offshore <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> promote themselves to prospective students. Second, a qualitative media analysis exposes dominant themes and ideologies that frame discussion of offshore <b>medical</b> <b>schools,</b> and the Canadians they graduate, in the Canadian print media. Finally, perceptions of offshore <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> held by stakeholders involved with Canadian medical education and the physical workforce are revealed using qualitative interviews...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{surveyed}} all Iraqi <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> and {{a cross-section}} of Iraqi medical students regarding their institutional and student experiences of medical education amidst ongoing conflict. The objective was {{to better understand the}} current resources and challenges facing <b>medical</b> <b>schools,</b> and the impacts of conflict on the training landscape and student experience, to provide evidence for further research and policy development. Setting: Deans of all Iraqi <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> registered in the World Directory of <b>Medical</b> <b>Schools</b> were invited to participate in a survey electronically. Medical students from three Iraqi <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> were invited to participate in a survey electronically. Outcomes: Primary: Student enrolment and graduation statistics; human resources of medical schools; dean perspectives on impact of conflict. Secondary: Medical student perspectives on quality of teaching, welfare and future career intentions. Findings: Of 24 <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> listed in the World Directory of <b>Medical</b> <b>Schools,</b> 15 replied to an initial email sent to confirm their contact details, and 8 <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> responded to our survey, giving a response rate from contactable <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> of 53 % and overall of 33 %. Five (63 %) <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> reported <b>medical</b> student educational attainment being impaired or significantly impaired; 4 (50 %) felt the quality of training <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> could offer had been impaired or significantly impaired due to conflict. A total of 197 medical students responded, 62 % of whom felt their safety had been threatened due to violent insecurity. The majority (56 %) of medical students intended to leave Iraq after graduating. Conclusions: <b>Medical</b> <b>schools</b> are facing challenges in staff recruitment and adequate resource provision; the majority believe quality of training has suffered as a result. Medical students are experiencing added psychological stress and lower quality of teaching; the majority intend to leave Iraq after graduation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Mentoring is {{considered}} a valuable component of undergraduate medical education {{with a variety of}} programs at established <b>medical</b> <b>schools.</b> This study presents how new <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> have set up mentoring programs as they have developed their curricula. Methods: Administrators from 14 US <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> established since 2006 were surveyed regarding the structure and implementation of their mentoring programs. Results: The majority of new <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> had mentoring programs that varied in structure and implementation. Although the programs were viewed as valuable at each institution, challenges when creating and implementing mentoring programs in new <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> included time constraints for faculty and students, and lack of financial and professional incentives for faculty. Conclusions: Similar to established <b>medical</b> <b>schools,</b> there was little uniformity among mentoring programs at new <b>medical</b> <b>schools,</b> likely reflecting differences in curriculum and program goals. Outcome measures are needed to determine whether a best practice for mentoring can be established...|$|R

We recommend that courses in basic and applied clinical nutrition be incorporated throughout the curricula of Canadian dental and <b>medical</b> <b>schools,</b> and that personnel trained in clinical nutrition be employed to provide instruction in this area...|$|R
40|$|Relationships {{between the}} {{pharmaceutical}} industry and <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> have recently been increasingly drawn into the media spotlight because {{of their ability to}} create conflicts of interest. Much of this attention is due to evidence that industry relationships can influence the attitudes and behaviours of medical students, with effects persisting beyond graduation. Objective: To examine the adequacy of policies at Australian <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> for managing potential conflicts of interest with {{the pharmaceutical industry}}. Design, setting and participants: National survey of 20  Australian <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> to assess their policies regarding disclosure and management of conflict of interest, undertaken in October 2009, using the American Medical Student Association’s PharmFree Scorecard. Main outcome measures: Policy scores and grades for Australian <b>medical</b> <b>schools.</b> Results: Compared with United States <b>medical</b> <b>schools,</b> Australian <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> performed better in only the curriculum domain and had a lower mean score overall (44 % v 58 %; P <  0. 001). Conclusion: Our results indicate a need for improved self-regulation of conflicts of interest in Australian <b>medical</b> <b>schools...</b>|$|R
