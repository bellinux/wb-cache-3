5|$|By the 1960s, {{the term}} {{rhythm and blues}} had no longer been in wide use; instead, terms like soul music were used to {{describe}} popular music by black artists. In the 1980s, however, rhythm and blues came back into use, <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> the form of R, a usage that has continued to the present. Contemporary R arose when sultry funk singers like Prince became very popular, alongside dance-oriented pop stars like Michael Jackson and Madonna.|$|E
5|$|Croup is a {{relatively}} common condition that affects about 15% of children at some point. It most commonly occurs between 6 months and 5 years of age but may rarely be seen in children as old as fifteen. It is slightly more common in males than females. It occurs <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> autumn. Before vaccination, croup was frequently caused by diphtheria and was often fatal. This cause is now very rare in the Western world due {{to the success of}} the diphtheria vaccine.|$|E

Triggers may include infection, not taking insulin correctly, stroke, and certain medications such as steroids. DKA results from a shortage of insulin; in response the body switches to burning fatty acids which produces acidic ketone bodies. DKA is typically diagnosed when testing finds high blood sugar, low blood pH, and ketoacids in either the blood or urine.|$|E
5|$|On occasion, {{groups of}} {{unrelated}} juveniles are observed. River otters living in groups hunt and travel together, {{use the same}} dens, resting sites, and latrines, and perform allogrooming. In freshwater systems, groups occur <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> autumn and during early winter. From mid-winter through the breeding season, adult females move and den alone. River otters are not territorial, but individual otters of different groups portray mutual avoidance. Home ranges of males are larger than those of females, and both sexes exhibit intra- and intersexual overlap of their domains.|$|E
5|$|Strontium {{commonly}} {{occurs in}} nature, being the 15th most abundant element on Earth (its heavier congener barium being the 14th), estimated to average approximately 360parts per {{million in the}} Earth's crust and is found chiefly as the sulfate mineral celestine (SrSO4) and the carbonate strontianite (SrCO3). Of the two, celestine occurs much more frequently in deposits of sufficient size for mining. Because strontium is used <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> the carbonate form, strontianite would be the more useful of the two common minerals, but few deposits have been discovered that are suitable for development.|$|E

5|$|A {{home run}} {{is a hit}} in which the player reaches home plate, and scores a run on the same play without being called out. <b>Most</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> modern baseball, this occurs when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory. However, it can occur on a ball hit to the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park home run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, {{and may not be}} fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in home runs is Barry Bonds, who hit 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds never hit for the cycle. The highest on the list to do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 home runs as of January 16, 2017), who hit for the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E
5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> clouds above freezing, {{and is also}} known as the warm rain process. In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.|$|E
5|$|Hosius {{brought to}} Poland the Jesuits and founded for them a college in Braniewo in 1564. Numerous Jesuit {{educational}} institutions and residencies {{were established in}} the following decades, <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity of centers of Protestant activity. Jesuit priests were carefully selected, well educated, of both noble and urban origins. They had soon become highly influential with the royal court, while working hard within all segments of the society. The Jesuit educational programs and Counter-Reformation propaganda utilized many innovative media techniques, often custom-tailored for a particular audience on hand, as well as time-tried methods of humanist instruction. Preacher Piotr Skarga and Bible translator Jakub Wujek count among prominent Jesuit personalities.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, {{pancreatic}} cancers of {{all types}} resulted in 411,600 deaths globally. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth {{most common cause of}} death from cancer in the United Kingdom, and the fourth most common in the United States. The disease occurs <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> the developed world, where about 70% of the new cases in 2012 originated. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has a very poor prognosis: after diagnosis, 25% of people survive one year and 5% live for five years. For cancers diagnosed early, the five-year survival rate rises to about 20%. Neuroendocrine cancers have better outcomes; at five years from diagnosis, 65% of those diagnosed are living, though survival varies considerably {{depending on the type of}} tumor.|$|E
5|$|Officials at {{the local}} level were the pergade, nadabova, nalagamiga, prabhu and gavunda. The pergades were superintendents from all social classes such as artisans, gold smiths, black smiths etc. The pergades dealing with the royal {{household}} were called manepergade (house superintendent) and those who collected tolls were called Sunka vergades. The nadabovas were accountants and tax collectors at the Nadu level and sometimes functioned as scribes. The nalagamigas were officers who organized and maintained defence at the Nadu level. The prabhu constituted a group of elite people drawn together to witness land grants and demarcation of land boundaries. The gavundas who appear <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> inscriptions were the backbone of medieval polity of the southern Karnataka region. They were landlords and local elite whom the state utilized their services to collect taxes, maintain records of landownership, bear witness to grants and transactions and even raise militia when required.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters live {{in coastal}} waters 15 to 23meters (50 to 75ft) deep, and usually stay within a {{kilometer}} (⅔mi) of the shore. They are found <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> areas with {{protection from the}} most severe ocean winds, such as rocky coastlines, thick kelp forests, and barrier reefs. Although they are most strongly associated with rocky substrates, sea otters can also live {{in areas where the}} sea floor consists primarily of mud, sand, or silt. Their northern range is limited by ice, as sea otters can survive amidst drift ice but not land-fast ice. Individuals generally occupy a home range a few kilometers long, and remain there year-round.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 600 {{grizzly bears}} {{live in the}} Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{with more than half}} of the population living within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to take it off the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting the grizzly are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. Black bears are common in the park and were a park symbol due to visitor interaction with the bears starting in 1910. Feeding and close contact with bears has not been permitted since the 1960s to reduce their desire for human foods. Yellowstone is one of the few places in the United States where black bears can be seen coexisting with grizzly bears. Black bear observations occur <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> the park's northern ranges and in the Bechler area which is in the park's southwestern corner.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} issues {{that can occur}} with horses' legs that may not necessarily cause lameness. Stocking up {{is an issue that}} occurs in horses that are held in stalls for multiple days after periods of activity. Fluid collects in the lower legs, producing swelling and often stiffness. Although it does not usually cause lameness or other problems, prolonged periods of stocking up can lead to other skin issues. Older horses and horse with heavy muscling are more prone to this condition. A shoe boil is an injury that occurs when there is trauma to the bursal sac of the elbow, causing inflammation and swelling. Multiple occurrences can cause a cosmetic sore and scar tissue, called a capped elbow, or infections. Shoe boils generally occur when a horse hits its elbow with a hoof or shoe when lying down. Windpuffs, or swelling {{to the back of the}} fetlock caused by inflammation of the sheaths of the deep digital flexor tendon, appear <b>most</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> the rear legs. Soft and fluid-filled, the swelling may initially be accompanied by heat and pain, but can remain long after the initial injury has healed without accompanying lameness. Repeated injuries to the tendon sheath, often caused by excessive training or work on hard surfaces, can cause larger problems and lameness.|$|E
