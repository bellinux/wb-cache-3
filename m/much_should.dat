25|$|In 1932 Macleod {{went up to}} Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, {{where he}} read History. His only {{recorded}} speech at the Cambridge Union Society was {{in his first term}} against the Ottawa agreement – his biographer comments that although not too <b>much</b> <b>should</b> be made of this, it suggests a lack of sentimental attachment to the Empire. He took no other part in student politics, but spent much of his time reading poetry and playing bridge, both for the University (he helped to found the Cambridge University Bridge Society) and at Crockfords and in the West End. He graduated with a Lower Second in 1935.|$|E
500|$|The three sculptors {{submitted}} design sketches in mid-February, and on [...] {{met with}} Woolley in New York City to make presentations {{of their work}} and answer his questions. [...] After discussions between Woolley and McAdoo, Weinman was notified on [...] that five of his sketches had been selected—for the dime and half dollar, and the reverse of the quarter. [...] The same day, Woolley wrote to MacNeil {{to tell him he}} would sculpt the quarter's obverse, and to Polasek to inform him of his lack of success. [...] Members of the Commission persuaded Woolley that so <b>much</b> <b>should</b> not be entrusted to a single artist, and MacNeil was allowed to design both sides of the quarter, subject to the sculptor producing a design satisfactory to Woolley.|$|E
500|$|After the {{remixing}} of {{the songs}} started, Benitez noted, [...] "We decided on basic questions like 'How loud should the drums be? How <b>much</b> <b>should</b> the vocals stand out?' These are creative decisions which will change the finished piece of music." [...] Shep Pettibone, one of the producers of the album commented that [...] "normally, without some music to work on, the remixer has nothing. But we already had Madonna's catalogue of danceable songs which was enough material for lifetime." [...] The mixes on You Can Dance exhibited a number of typical mixing techniques. Instrumental passages were lengthened to increase the time for dancing, which undermined the tighter structure of the original pop song. Vocal phrases were repeated and subjected to multiple echoes, panned across the stereophonic sound outlets. At certain points, almost no music is heard except the drums and at others, the drums are removed with only the hi-hat left to keep time.|$|E

500|$|On May 20, 2016 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{announced}} {{changes to}} the Nutrition Facts panel displayed on all foods, to be effective by July 2018. New to the panel is a requirement to list [...] "Added sugars" [...] by weight and {{as a percent of}} Daily Value (DV). For vitamins and minerals the intent of DVs is to indicate how <b>much</b> <b>should</b> be consumed. For added sugars, the guidance is that 100% DV should not be exceeded. 100% DV is defined as 50 grams. For a person consuming 2000 calories a day, 50 grams, the amount to not exceed, is the same as 200 calories, and thus 10% of total calories - same guidance as the World Health Organization. To put this into context, most 12 ounce (335 mL) cans of soda contain 39 grams of sugar. In the United States, a recently published government survey on food consumption reported that for men and women ages 20 and older the average total sugar intakes - naturally occurring in foods and added - were, respectively, 125 and 99 g/day.|$|E
500|$|After {{buying the}} rights to the film, Katzenberg quickly put it in active {{development}} in November 1995. Steven Spielberg had thought about making a traditionally animated film adaption of the book before, when he bought {{the rights to}} the book in 1991 before the founding of DreamWorks, where Bill Murray would play Shrek and Steve Martin would play Donkey. In the beginning of production, co-director Andrew Adamson refused to be intimidated by Katzenberg and had an argument with him how <b>much</b> <b>should</b> the film appeal to adults. Katzenberg wanted both audiences, but he deemed some of Adamson's ideas, such as adding sexual jokes and Guns N' Roses music to the soundtrack, to be too outrageous. Adamson and Kelly Asbury joined in 1997 to co-direct the film. However, Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film , and was replaced with story artist Vicky Jenson. Both Adamson and Jenson decided to work on the film in half, so the crew could at least know who to go to with specific detail questions about the film's sequences; [...] "We both ended up doing a lot of everything," [...] Adamson said. [...] "We're both kinda control freaks, and we both wanted to do everything." ...|$|E

Based {{on his work}} tools are developed [...] "that shipping companies use {{to determine how many}} planes they need and where their delivery trucks should be deployed. The oil industry long has used linear programming in refinery planning, as it determines how much of its raw product should become different grades of gasoline and how <b>much</b> <b>should</b> be used for petroleum-based byproducts. It is used in manufacturing, revenue management, telecommunications, advertising, architecture, circuit design and countless other areas".|$|E
2500|$|In {{this paper}} Ramsey's {{contribution}} to economic theory was the elegant concept of Ramsey pricing. This is applicable {{in situations where}} a (regulated) monopolist wants to maximise consumer surplus whilst {{at the same time}} ensuring that its costs are adequately covered. This is achieved by setting the price such that the markup over marginal cost is inversely proportional to the price elasticity of demand for that good. Like its predecessor this paper was published in The Economic Journal in 1927. Ramsey poses the question that is to be solved {{at the beginning of the}} article: [...] "a given revenue is to be raised by proportionate taxes on some or all uses of income, the taxes on different uses being possibly at different rates; how <b>much</b> <b>should</b> these rates be adjusted in order that the decrement of utility may be a minimum?" [...] (Ramsey 1927). The problem was suggested to him by the economist Arthur Pigou and the paper was Ramsey's answer to the problem.|$|E

2500|$|Many critics awarded {{praise for}} the album's raw and {{powerful}} emotions. James Skinner of Drowned in Sound commended the record for its feeling of [...] "naked emotion on display." [...] Skinner further commented on the album, stating it [...] "certainly isn’t a unanimously easy listen (that <b>much</b> <b>should</b> be clear from its title alone), but themes like those of ‘Butterfly Knife’ are leavened by that ever-present defiance." [...] Nick Neyland from Pitchfork lauded the album, calling it [...] "a fiercely individual record, made by a musician with a fearless and courageous approach to her art. Crucially, the desire to let such raw emotion out in song never feels forced." [...] Paul Schrodt of Slant Magazine observed that [...] "Rock music is not an uncommon {{way to deal with}} pain, either for the people who make it or for those who listen to it, but it's rare when those raw emotions translate into a record as focused and accomplished as EMA's debut". Ad Mehta from One Thirty BPM gave the record high marks, stating [...] "With fresh, sonically adventurous juxtapositions, and bold, honest lyrics, [...] engages the listener in an intense, emotional journey.|$|E
