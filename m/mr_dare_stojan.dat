60|$|This <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare</b> packed herself, {{and placed}} in the hallway late on Saturday afternoon.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare</b> {{gave him}} some water, but he only drank a little, {{and then began to}} cough.|$|R
60|$|The {{insurance}} papers {{had been}} found, but <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare</b> was undecided whether to rebuild or accept the cash.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello, Springer!" [...] exclaimed Norris to {{the tall}} {{young man who}} had {{admitted}} them. [...] "You're locked up as if this was a sub-treasury. This is a friend of mine. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Springer, our worthy secretary." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was over}} in a moment, and when the men arrived <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare</b> was as calm as any of them.|$|R
60|$|As Mr. Styles had predicted, {{at the end}} {{of three}} months <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare's</b> pension money was in the widow's possession. Long before this, however, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare</b> sold her land in Mossvale, and removed with her family to New York, having apartments {{adjacent}} to Mrs. Massanet, with whom she was soon on intimate terms. She advanced the necessary money to Richard, and he and Frank Massanet immediately bought out Mr. Martin's store and set up business on their own account.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't trouble yourself, Jane," [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare</b> feebly. [...] "You've {{done enough}} already," [...] {{and then the}} pain caused him to faint away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dad's sick. We {{just left}} him. Marm and Mary are dead. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare</b> says you've got money for dad. I'm so glad, 'cause he's sick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{tells the}} truth!" [...] cried <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare.</b> [...] "I have heard your father mention his name. Thank heaven for having brought you two together!" ...|$|R
60|$|At this {{juncture}} a violent fit of coughing seized <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare,</b> {{and by the}} time he had recovered, his wife and the three girls entered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's all right. I'm {{aware of}} that; but <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare</b> is a new-comer to New York, and I'm only showing him around a bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} forget to write {{as soon as}} you arrive and find a {{stopping}} place," [...] cautioned <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare</b> for at least the fifth time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed not!" [...] put in <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare.</b> [...] "I {{would not}} have you stay out doors all night, like a tramp. There are plenty of cheap lodging-houses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right." [...] <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare</b> {{paused for}} a moment. [...] "I'm sorry that I cannot leave you more of a capital upon which to start in life." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare</b> {{shook her}} head. But {{it was all}} to no purpose. Richard was firm, and doubly so when Grace gave him a pert look of approval.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind. It {{will all}} be over soon," [...] replied <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare</b> with a heavy cough. [...] "I suppose the doctor has told you. He said he would." ...|$|R
60|$|None {{of the men}} {{cared to}} face <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare</b> with such painful news, {{and it was only}} after {{repeated}} urging that Nicholas Boswell had been induced to go on ahead.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare,</b> {{that you}} will not speak of what you have seen here to-night," [...] went on Don Wimler. [...] "It might place us in an {{unpleasant}} predicament." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is no {{rest for}} me here,' he said, rising {{and going to}} the window, {{carefully}} avoiding the neighbourhood of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare.</b> When Havill had glanced out he returned to dress himself.|$|R
60|$|Thereupon Somerset at once {{went down}} to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare.</b> His coming {{as a sort of}} {{counterfeit}} of Miss Power disposed Somerset to judge him with as much severity as justice would allow, and his manner for the moment was not of a kind calculated to dissipate antagonistic instincts. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare</b> was standing before the fireplace with his feet wide apart, and his hands in the pockets of his coat-tails, looking at a carving over the mantelpiece. He turned quickly at the sound of Somerset's footsteps, and revealed himself as a person quite out of the common.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare.</b> I'll {{remember}} it, and you too. But don't go for {{to put a}} figure-head to my name. Plain Doc Linyard is {{good enough}} for such a tough customer as me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is my father," [...] went on Doc Linyard to Richard. [...] "Pop, {{here is a}} chum as I {{picked up}} on the road. His name is <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare,</b> and he saved my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-by, Richard," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare.</b> [...] "God be with you!" [...] And {{then she}} {{added in a}} whisper: [...] "Don't be afraid to come {{home as soon as}} you don't like it any more." ...|$|R
60|$|On Thursday evening Frank {{accompanied}} {{him to the}} neighborhood in which <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare</b> had once resided; but, though the two spent nearly three hours in the search, no trace of any former acquaintance was found.|$|R
6000|$|... "I dunno," [...] replied Pep slowly. [...] "Dad don't want no visitors. I {{was only}} going to get <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare.</b> But I reckon you can come. Dad won't know de difference. He ain't right here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shoo--'tain't nothing, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare,</b> {{alongside}} of {{what you}} did for me," [...] replied the sailor. [...] "But I've had a run of bad luck since I left New York two days ago," [...] he added meditatively.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, 'twould be a pity {{to make a}} mess here {{under such}} dubious circumstances. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare,</b> I {{perceive}} that a mean vagabond can be as sharp as a political regenerator. I cry quits, if you care to do the same?' ...|$|R
60|$|No {{need to call}} Richard on the {{following}} morning. He was up and dressed at five, and impatient for the start. Every one turned in towards serving him a hot breakfast, and in addition <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare</b> put him up a tidy lunch in a box.|$|R
60|$|When Dr. Melvin {{came back}} they all {{left the room}} but <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare.</b> A {{thorough}} examination was made that lasted nearly an hour. By the grave {{look on his face}} when the doctor called him, Richard knew that he was to receive no encouraging news.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{fact that}} Clover had been drafted in Boston, but during {{the second year of}} his service his time had expired, and then he had enlisted in a Brooklyn regiment, and {{become a member of the}} same company to which <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare</b> belonged.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could hardly}} bear {{to have you}} go away," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare.</b> [...] "It would be so lonely--your father and you both out of the house. I would rather have you home, {{even if we had}} a good deal less to live upon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sure you}} have been busy enough, Richard," [...] responded <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare</b> fondly. [...] "I am well {{satisfied}} with {{the way you have}} planted the garden; and no carpenter could have made a neater job of the front fence. You haven't wasted your time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get up, Doc!" [...] she cried, shaking him vigorously. [...] "Get up! Here's your nevvy; and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare</b> {{has found}} Tom! Just think of it--he's found Tom! Wake up, Doc! Was ever {{there such a}} man! To keep on {{sleeping}} with such good news to hear!" ...|$|R
60|$|There was one thing, though, {{that the}} boy was obstinate about. He would not accept {{all of the money}} that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Dare</b> thought it her duty to make him take. The price of his ticket and five dollars was Richard's limit, and to this he stuck.|$|R
5000|$|Executive Commissioner (Stakeholder Management) - <b>Mr.</b> Sunday <b>Dare</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Ferguson {{has left}} it on record--and, presumably, he had Fletcher's word for it--that it was {{no part of the}} Scot's intent to do <b>Mr.</b> <b>Dare</b> a mischief. He had but drawn the pistol to intimidate him into better manners, but in his haste he accidentally pulled the trigger.|$|R
