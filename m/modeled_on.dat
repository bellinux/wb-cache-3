40|$|We {{present the}} exact closed-form {{expression}} for the partition {{function of a}} dimer <b>model</b> <b>on</b> a generalized finite checkerboard rectangular lattice under periodic boundary conditions. We investigate three different sets of dimer weights, each with different critical behaviors. We then consider different limits for the <b>model</b> <b>on</b> the three lattices. In one limit, the model {{for each of the}} three lattices is reduced to the dimer <b>model</b> <b>on</b> a rectangular lattice, which belongs to the c=- 2 universality class. In another limit, two of the lattices reduce to the anisotropic Kasteleyn <b>model</b> <b>on</b> a honeycomb lattice, the universality class of which is given by c= 1. The result that the dimer <b>model</b> <b>on</b> a generalized checkerboard rectangular lattice can manifest different critical behaviors is consistent with early studies in the thermodynamic limit and also provides insight into corrections to scaling arising from the finite-size versions of the model...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} {{as the result of}} the nesting {{property}} of the Fermi surface, the quarter-doped Hubbard <b>model</b> <b>on</b> honeycomb lattice is unstable with respect to the formation of a magnetic insulating state with nonzero spin chirality for infinitesimally small strength of electron correlation. The insulating state is found to be topological nontrivial and to have a quantized Hall conductance of σ_xy=e^ 2 /h. We find the Fermi surface nesting is robust for arbitrary value of next-nearest-neighbor hopping integral. It is thus very possible that the quarter-doped graphene system will realize such an exotic ground state. We also show that the quarter-doped Hubbard <b>model</b> <b>on</b> honeycomb lattice is in exact equivalence in the weak coupling limit with the 3 / 4 -filled Hubbard <b>model</b> <b>on</b> triangular lattice, in which similar effect is also observed.
