5|$|The CPC has {{retained}} close {{relations with the}} remaining socialist states still espousing communism: Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam and their respective ruling parties. It spends {{a fair amount of}} time analyzing the situation in the remaining socialist states, trying to reach conclusions as to why these states survived when so many did not, following the collapse of the Eastern European socialist states in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. In general, the analyses of the remaining socialist states and their chances of survival have been positive, and the CPC believes that the socialist <b>movement</b> <b>will</b> be revitalized sometime in the future.|$|E

Some critics also fear that the <b>movement</b> <b>will</b> prevent autistic children from receiving important therapies. Kit Weintraub has responded to Michelle Dawson's claims that ABA is harmful by insisting that it is medically necessary and appropriate treatment, and that it is harmful to deny it to autistic children who need it.|$|E

Outside of two-movement works (which, classically speaking, will maintain the same tonic for both <b>movements</b> and <b>will</b> thus be homotonal by definition), classical-era homotonality is relatively rare: a classical work in three <b>movements</b> <b>will</b> normally {{move to a}} different tonic for its middle movement, and a classical work in four <b>movements</b> <b>will</b> normally {{have at least one}} of its middle movements in a key other than the original tonic.|$|R

25|$|Some {{economists who}} have studied {{proposals}} for universal healthcare worry that the consumer driven healthcare <b>movement</b> <b>will</b> reduce the social redistributive effects of insurance that pools high-risk and low-risk people together. This concern {{was one of the}} driving factors behind a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, informally known as Obamacare, which limited the types of purchases which could be made with HSA funds. For example, as of January 1, 2011, these funds can no longer be used to buy over-the-counter drugs without a medical prescription.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{asymmetrical}} thrust {{has been}} used for directional control: if the left engine is idled and power is increased on the right side this will result in a yaw to the left, and vice versa. If throttle settings allow the throttles to be shifted without affecting the total amount of power, then yaw control can be combined with pitch control. If the aircraft is yawing, then the wing on the outside of this yaw <b>movement</b> <b>will</b> go faster than the inner wing. This creates higher lift on the faster wing, resulting in a rolling movement, which helps to make a turn.|$|E

It was first thought Anthony's image would be featured on the $10 bill. The decision to retain Alexander Hamilton, the first US Secretary of the Treasury and architect of all US financial systems on the $10 bill meant that Anthony {{would need to be}} featured on another piece of US currency.

25|$|In general, child {{trafficking}} {{takes place in}} three stages: recruitment, movement, and exploitation. Recruitment occurs {{when a child is}} approached by a recruiter, or in some cases, directly approaches a recruiter themselves. Recruitment is initiated in many different ways: adolescents may be under pressure to contribute to their families, children may be kidnapped or abducted into trafficking, or families may be trafficked together. Then, <b>movement</b> <b>will</b> occur - locally, regionally, and/or internationally - through a variety of transportation types, including by car, train, boat, or foot. Ultimately, the final goal of {{child trafficking}} is exploitation, whereby traffickers use the services of children to garner illegal profit. Exploitation can take place in a variety of forms, including forced labor, sexual exploitation, and child begging, among other practices.|$|E
25|$|The Cape cobra is a diurnal {{species and}} {{actively}} forages throughout the day. During very hot weather {{it may become}} crepuscular, but is rarely if ever observed during the hours of darkness. It is a terrestrial snake, but will readily climb trees and bushes, and shows considerable agility in for example systematically robbing the nests of the sociable weaver. When not active, it hides in holes or under ground cover, such as brush piles, often remaining in the same retreat for some time. It is a quick moving and alert species, and although a report mentions that this species is generally calm when compared to some other African venomous snakes, it strikes readily if threatened. When disturbed and brought to bay the Cape cobra raises its forebody off the ground, spreads a broad hood and may hiss loudly. While on the defensive, it strikes unhesitatingly. If the threat remains motionless, the snake will quickly attempt to escape, but at any sign of <b>movement</b> <b>will</b> adopt its defensive posture again. The Cape cobra is more aggressive during the mating period.|$|E

25|$|Normally, {{the face}} is in the water during front crawl with eyes looking at {{the lower part of}} the wall in front of the pool, with the {{waterline}} between the brow line and the hairline. Breaths are taken through the mouth by turning the head to the side of a recovering arm at the beginning of the recovery, and breathing in the triangle between the upper arm, lower arm, and the waterline. The swimmer's forward <b>movement</b> <b>will</b> cause a bow wave with a trough in the water surface near the ears. After turning the head, a breath can be taken in this trough without the need to move the mouth above the average water surface. A thin film of water running down the head can be blown away just before the intake. The head is rotated back at the end of the recovery and points down and forward again when the recovered hand enters the water. The swimmer breathes out through mouth and nose until the next breath. Breathing out through the nose may help to prevent water from entering the nose. Swimmers with allergies exacerbated by time in the pool should not expect exhaling through the nose to completely prevent intranasal irritation.|$|E

[...] A significant percentage of Scientists remained single (Eddy placed little emphasis on marriage and family), or became Scientists when their children were adults and unlikely to be converted. Christian Science did not have missionaries, so it relied on internal growth, but the conversion rate within families was not high. In a study cited by Stark, of 80 people raised within Christian Science just 26 (33 percent) became Scientists themselves.|$|E

He highlighted the royal family's almost complete monopoly on power, the political stalemate and ongoing human rights violations as main motivations. Yousif added that the main principles of the movement were peacefulness, non-exclusion and recognizing the people's right to self-determination, and called the authorities to understand their demands and refrain from using violence against protesters.

According to the {{political}} scientist Stan Taylor, the GBM reflected Tyndall's desire for [...] "a specifically British variant of National Socialism". It called for the criminalisation of sexual relations and marriages between white Britons and non-whites and called for the sterilisation of those it deemed unfit to reproduce. The group established its base in a run-down building in Notting Hill, with swastikas being sprayed onto the exterior and an image of Hitler decorating the interior. Tyndall tried to convince the WUNS to accept his GBM as its British representative, however Rockwell—concerned not to encourage schismatic dissenters in his own American Nazi Party—sided with Jordan and the NSM. Tyndall then established contact with Rockwell's main rival in the American Neo-Nazi scene, the National States' Rights Party.|$|E
