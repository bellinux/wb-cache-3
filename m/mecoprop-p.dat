40|$|<b>Mecoprop-p</b> [(R) - 2 -(4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenoxy) propanoic acid) {{is widely}} used 37 in {{agriculture}} and poses an environmental concern because of its susceptibility to leach 38 from soil to water. We investigated the effect of soil depth on <b>mecoprop-p</b> 39 biodegradation and {{its relationship with the}} number and diversity of tfdA related genes, 40 which are the most widely known genes involved in degradation of the 41 phenoxyalkanoic acid group of herbicides by bacteria. <b>Mecoprop-p</b> half-life (DT 50) was 42 approximately 12 days in soil sampled from < 30 cm depth, and increased progressively 43 with soil depth, reaching over 84 days at 70 - 80 cm. In sub-soil there was a lag period of 44 between 23 and 34 days prior to a phase of rapid degradation. No lag phase occurred in 45 top-soil samples prior to the onset of degradation. The maximum degradation rate was 46 the same in top-soil and sub-soil samples. Although diverse tfdAα and tfdA genes were 47 present prior to <b>mecoprop-p</b> degradation, real time PCR revealed that degradation was 48 associated with proliferation of tfdA genes. The number of tfdA genes and the most 49 probable number of <b>mecoprop-p</b> degrading organisms in soil prior to <b>mecoprop-p</b> 50 addition were below the limit of quantification and detection respectively. Melting 51 curves from the real time PCR analysis showed that prior to <b>mecoprop-p</b> degradation 52 both class I and class III tfdA genes were present in top- and sub-soil samples. However 53 at all soil depths only tfdA class III genes proliferated during degradation. Denaturing 54 gradient gel electrophoresis confirmed that class III tfdA genes were associated with 55 <b>mecoprop-p</b> degradation. Degradation was not associated with the induction of novel 56 tfdA genes in top- or sub-soil samples, and there were no apparent differences in tfdA 57 gene diversity with soil depth prior to or following degradation...|$|E

Hence, the consumer risk assessment is considered indicative only and some MRL proposals derived by EFSA still require further consideration by risk managers...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} Ambrosia artemisiifolia by {{chemical}} and mechanical means was studied {{in a single}} year EU Project which was conducted in 2009. Results of pot and field trials from Germany are presented. Florasulam, Mesotrione and <b>Mecoprop-P</b> applied before BBCH 14 of Ambrosia artemisiifolia were effective control agents. Only the none-selective herbicide Glyphosat provided a high control when applied at later BBCH stages. Overall mean efficacy rates between 79 % and 100 % were achieved. Both physical control measures, cutting and hoeing, did not result in satisfying control results. The effect of physical weed control was tested on gravel, in grassland and in maize. Even a repeated mechanical control did not increase the efficacy which was assessed in terms of dry matter reduction. None of the physical control measures was able to stop the growth of A. artemisiifolia plants and their seed production. Ambrosia is not very competitive as trials in spring barley demonstrated. At decreasing crop densities and competition higher dose rates of <b>Mecoprop-P</b> were needed to achieve the same control level. Under crop-free conditions the efficacy of the highest tested dosage (1200 g ha- 1 <b>Mecoprop-P)</b> was 84 %. However, at a crop density of 300 plants/m² the herbicide application could not significantly reduce the biomass of A. artemisiifolia. The results highlight the importance of preventative measures of good agricultural practice as e. g. crop rotation and dense competitive crop stands. In the long run, these measures are crucial for a long-term successful control of A. artemisiifolia in agricultural fields...|$|E

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the {{determination}} of polar pesticides in surface and waste waters. In this study <b>Mecoprop-P,</b> MCPA, Dichlorprop-P, 2, 4 -D and MCPBA in differently loaded surface waters and communal waters from sewage treatment plants were analyzed. These herbicides are included in the group identified as environmental quality standards. Some of herbicides (2, 4 -D and MCPA) were selected because their consumption in the Czech Republic exceeds 30 tons a year. Samples were collected prom three rivers near town of Jaroměř (Elbe, Úpa and Metuje Rivers), from one river near the town of Brno (Svratka River) and from inflow and outflow of two sewage treatment plants (WWTP Jaroměř, WWTP Brno – Modřice). Particular rivers were chosen for monitoring due to the probability of occurrence of herbicides, because they flow through agriculturally cultivated areas. Solid phase extraction (SPE) was used for the isolation of target compounds and their concentration. Gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) was used for the determination of target analytes in surface and waste waters. Selected herbicides were detected in all collected samples...|$|E
40|$|Prairie {{wetlands}} {{are affected}} by agricultural activities, in particular herbicide contamination of wetland ecosystems. The environmental fate of herbicides in wetlands is determined by their persistence and transport. Currently, {{little is known about}} the persistence of commonly used herbicides in wetland water and sediment. The objective of this dissertation was to determine the importance of wetland sediments in influencing the fate of commonly used herbicides in prairie wetlands. Sediment sorption is an important dissipation pathway for herbicides. The effects of land use on physicochemical properties of wetland sediment, and the associations between these properties and herbicide sorption characteristics for four herbicides (trifluralin, atrazine, 2, 4 -D and glyphosate), were examined for 17 wetlands. The sorption of herbicides in sediment increased in the order of 2, 4 -D < atrazine < glyphosate < trifluralin. Overall, sediments from wetlands that were recently cultivated had lower total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), electrical conductivity (EC), exchangeable cation (EXCAT), cation excheageable capacity (CEC), and sorption coefficient (Kd) values (2, 4 -D, trifluralin, and atrazine) than sediments from semi-permanent and riparian ephemeral wetlands. Although TOC content was correlated to the sorption of 2, 4 -D, trifluralin and atrazine, riparian wetland sediments despite having a lower TOC content than semi-permanent wetland sediments, had the highest herbicide sorption capacity for 2, 4 -D, trifluralin and atrazine. To further examine the link between land use and herbicide sorption by sediment, a multi-residue analytical method was developed to quantify seven sulfonylurea herbicides commonly used in crop production (thifensulfuron-methyl, tribenuron-methyl, ethametsulfuron-methyl, metsulfuron-methyl, rimsulfuron, nicosulfuron and sulfosulfuron) in sediment from 17 wetlands. Sediment was extracted with deionized water using pressurized liquid extraction and the resultant extracts were cleaned-up using Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction cartridges. Quantification and confirmation were performed using liquid chromatography interfaced with positive ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, and multiple reaction monitoring. Calibration curves were linear with correlation coefficients greater than 0. 994 and limits of quantification ranged from 1. 0 to 2. 0 µg kg- 1. Ethametsulfuron-methyl, sulfosulfuron and metsulfuron-methyl, the three most environmentally persistent of the seven sulfonylurea herbicides monitored in this study, were most frequently detected in wetland sediment. The concentrations of sulfonylurea herbicides were higher in sediments from the semi-permanent wetland, which received surface runoff from a larger catchment. To assess the relationship between herbicide dissipation and sorption to sediment, seven commonly used herbicides (glyphosate, dicamba, bromoxynil, 2, 4 -D, MCPA, <b>mecoprop-P</b> and dichlorprop) were applied to one half of an ephemeral (E) and a semi-permanent (SP) prairie wetland to mimic a direct overspray event, a worst-case scenario for wetland contamination. Water and sediment samples collected over a 77 -d study period (early June to late August) were analyzed for herbicide concentration; aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), the degradation product of glyphosate, was also monitored. Glyphosate dissipated rapidly in the water column of each wetland with DT 50 values of 3. 7 d for wetland E and 6. 9 d for wetland SP. The mass of AMPA in each wetland increased with a concomitant decrease in the mass of glyphosate, suggesting that glyphosate degradation was occurring in the water column. In addition, glyphosate was also lost from the water column via sorption to bottom sediment, as evidenced by its detection in sediment samples up to 42 -d post-treatment (39. 0 – 224. 5 µg kg- 1). The DT 50 of the other six acid herbicides ranged from 2. 3 d (bromoxynil) to 31 d (dichlorprop). The two chiral herbicides, <b>mecoprop-P</b> and dichlorprop, were the most persistent acid herbicides in the water column. Sorption to sediment was also an important dissipation route for these six herbicides in water, especially in wetland E. After 77 d in the semi-permanent wetland and 56 d in the ephemeral wetland, the concentrations of bromoxynil, dicamba and 2, 4 -D were below the Canadian Water Quality Guidelines for the Protection of Aquatic Life. Concentrations of the more persistent herbicides (<b>mecoprop-P</b> and dichlorprop) remained at levels above the guidelines. Use of bromide ion as a conservative tracer indicated that some of the water loss from both wetlands was via infiltration. Because there was a strong correlation between the decrease in bromide ion and herbicide mass in the water column, it is possible some herbicides were lost from the water column along with the infiltrating water. Infiltration to wetland margins during this part of the growing season would have been largely driven by the riparian vegetation surrounding both wetlands. Overall, this thesis demonstrated the importance of sediment in the dissipation of currently used herbicides in wetland ecosystems. Both laboratory sorption studies and whole-wetland experiments provided insights on the sorptivity of herbicides in sediment as well as their persistence in water and sediment...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project aims {{to investigate the}} toxicity of six commonly used agricultural pesticides (formulations based on glyphosate, <b>mecoprop-p,</b> chlorothalonil, mancozeb, metaldehyde and chlorpyrifos) on three key functional groups of the freshwater environment. This was achieved by carrying out laboratory acute toxicity studies on 1) the bacterial community of a dehydrated microbial seed, 2) the submerged aquatic macrophyte species Myriophyllum aquaticum and 3) the aquatic invertebrate species Daphnia magna. Firstly, the impact of pesticide exposure on the bacterial trophic level of a freshwater system was carried out. The effect of the pesticides on bacterial activity was measured by assessing the oxygen consumption of the population over time. This was achieved by using the standard BOD 5 method and the Oxitop control measuring system. The inhibitory effect of the test substance on the bacterial population was {{measured in terms of}} percentage inhibition of BOD 5, length of the lag phase, slope of the line during the exponential growth phase and EC 50 values calculated at various time points on the growth response curve. Based on the results, the overall toxicity order of the pesticide formulations towards the bacterial population was as follows; glyphosate/mecoprop-p > chlorothalonil/chlorpyrifos > metaldehyde > mancozeb. Based on the EC 50 value obtained, these pesticides are not thought to have a long term inhibitory effect on bacteria. All pesticides were degraded and used as a food source by the bacteria seed population over the test period. This indicates that freshwater systems have the ability to remediate against pesticide contamination. A second toxicity bioassay was carried out on the submerged aquatic macrophyte Myriophyllum aquaticum, which represented the macrophyte trophic level of the system. While no standard procedure for toxicity testing of Myriophyllum aquaticum exists, the experimental procedure used was based on the Myriophyllum toxicity test method developed by the SETAC Aquatic Macrophyte Ecotoxicology Group (AMEG), with some minor modifications. Submerged rooted M. aquaticum shoots were exposed to the test substance, under controlled conditions, for a period of 14 days. Macrophyte inhibition was assessed by recording shoot length, biomass wet and dry weight, root length and root number, as well as noting physical changes of the plant {{over the course of the}} study. Based on mean toxicity values, the toxicity scale of the six pesticides examined was as follows; mancozeb > mecoporp-p > glyphosate > chlorpyrifos > chlorothalonil > metaldehyde. Five of the six pesticides examined exerted a toxic effect on M. aquaticum. Glyphosate, <b>mecoprop-p,</b> chlorothalonil, mancozeb and chlorpyrifos were all found to be toxic to the plant. Metaldehyde was the only active ingredient which did not stunt the plant growth. Due to the large range in sensitivity of parameters, it was concluded that a number of parameters should be used when measuring macrophyte toxicity. Roots are particularly sensitive to pollutants and where possible should always be included in toxicity tests. Finally, the toxicity of plant protection products on the invertebrate trophic level of a freshwater ecosystem was examined by carrying out the Acute Immobilisation Test of Daphnia (OECD 202). The toxicity order of the pesticides towards daphnia was found to be as follows; mancozeb > chlorpyrifos > metaldehyde > chlorothalonil > glyphosate > <b>mecoprop-p.</b> Fungicide and insecticide products were the most harmful to daphnia while herbicidal products posed less of a risk. The OECD 202 Daphnia immobility study is a general protocol for the assessment of a wide variety of chemical substances, however, some modification for the assessment of plant protection products have been suggested. Stirring or aeration of the test solution may be required in cases where the test substance does not easily remain in solution. Secondly, distinguishing between immobility and mortality of daphnia, while more time consuming, can provide useful additional information on the effect of the substance on the daphnia. By combining the above results, an overall assessment of the toxicity of pesticides on the freshwater environment can be evaluated. It was concluded that individual pesticides effect each trophic level differently. The invertebrate trophic level was observed to be the most sensitive to pesticide exposure, while the bacterial trophic level was the least sensitive. Bacterial populations have the potential to remediate against pesticide exposure and are an important defence against pesticide pollution events. It was concluded that of the six pesticide formulations examined here, mancozeb and in particular chlorpyrifos based formulations pose the greatest risk to the overall aquatic ecosystem. This is due to their toxicity on the three test species but also based on their potential for wider ecosystem effects. A tiered toxicity assessment, using a number of toxicity assays from different trophic levels, is therefore considered an effective way of assessing the risk posed by pollutants to the aquatic environment as a whole...|$|E

40|$|G. aparine ist eine sehr anpassungsfähige, weit verbreitete Pflanzenart und zählt zu den bedeutendsten Unkrautarten in einer Vielzahl von Kulturen. Nicht selten wird über eine größere Variabilität innerhalb G. aparine hinsichtlich verschiedener Eigenschaften berichtet. Aus diesem Grund und aufgrund der Tatsache, dass umfassende Informationen zur Biologie und Ökologie dieser Art für eine erfolgreiche Bekämpfung erforderlich sind, wurde in vorliegender Arbeit die Diversität von G. aparine unter gleichen Wachstumsbedingungen untersucht. Dies erfolgte anhand von 24 aus Europa stammenden Ackerpopulationen mit teilweiser bekannter Feldhistorie, wobei zum Vergleich eine Herkunft aus einer Hecke und eine Population von G. spurium mitgeführt wurde. Die Herkünfte wurden hinsichtlich ihrer Empfindlichkeit gegenüber verschiedenen Herbiziden sowie hinsichtlich ihrer Morphologie und Phänologie untersucht. Mithilfe der RAPD-PCR wurde die Variabilität einiger Populationen auch auf molekularbiologischer Ebene erfasst. Die Untersuchungen zur Herbizidempfindlichkeit zeigten, dass Ackerpopulationen von G. aparine unterschiedlich empfindlich auf verschiedene Wirkstoffe reagieren. Die größten Unterschiede zwischen den Herkünften waren bei Anwendung eines Versuchsproduktes zu verzeichnen, wobei die Herkünfte sich auf dem für die Bekämpfung relevanten Niveau der ED 90 maximal um den Faktor 6, 8 voneinander unterschieden. Die kleinste Variabilität wurde bei Einsatz von <b>Mecoprop-P</b> sowie Cinidon-ethyl ermittelt. Hier unterschieden sich die Herkünfte maximal um das 1, 5 bzw. 1, 7 fache voneinander. Resistente Herkünfte gegenüber den geprüften Wirkstoffen konnten nicht ausfindig gemacht werden. Die mitgeführte Heckenpopulation unterschied sich nicht von den Ackerpopulationen, G. spurium reagierte teilweise ein wenig empfindlicher als G. aparine. Zwischen den ermittelten Herbizidempfindlichkeiten der Herkünfte und den in der Feldhistorie aufgeführten chemischen Bekämpfungsmaßnahmen konnte kein Kausalzusammenhang ermittelt werden. Die Ergebnisse, die mit dem Versuchsprodukt und Cinidon-ethyl erzielt wurden, müssen auf eine natürliche Variabilität zurückzuführen sein, da die Wirkstoffe sich zum Zeitpunkt der Entnahme der Herkünfte von den Flächen noch nicht auf dem Markt befanden. Es konnten keine Regionen ausfindig gemacht werden, in denen gegenüber einem Wirkstoff sensitivere bzw. unsensitivere Herkünfte dominieren. Die Untersuchungen zur Morphologie und Phänologie zeigten, dass die Herkünfte sich hinsichtlich einer Vielzahl von Merkmalen voneinander unterscheiden. Bei den meisten Parametern lagen die jeweils zu ermittelnden Unterschiede in nahezu gleicher Größenordnung, wobei die Herkünfte in der Regel maximal um das 1, 2 - 1, 5 fache variierten. Größere Unterschiede konnten hinsichtlich der Keimblattfläche, der Samenzahl und des Samenertrages ermittelt werden, wobei bezüglich des letzten Parameters die größte Variabilität innerhalb G. aparine ermittelt wurde. Die Herkünfte unterschieden sich hier maximal um das 2, 4 fache voneinander. Einige Populationen fielen dahingehend auf, dass sie gleich hinsichtlich mehrerer Parameter größere bzw. kleinere Ausprägungen annahmen, das heißt, dass einige Herkünfte von recht kräftigem, andere von eher zierlichem Habitus waren. Anhand einer Clusteranalyse konnten die G. aparine-Herkünfte in vier Ähnlichkeitsgruppen eingeteilt werden. Die Heckenpopulation differenzierte sich nicht von den Ackerpopulationen, während G. spurium sich bezüglich einiger Merkmale, wie erwartet, deutlich von G. aparine unterschied. Mithilfe einer Korrelationsanalyse konnten zwischen einigen Parametern statistische Zusammenhänge nachgewiesen werden. Beispielsweise resultierte aus einem früheren Blühbeginn häufig ein höherer Samenertrag. Die Ausprägung einiger Merkmale könnte mit der geographischen Herkunft der Populationen in Zusammenhang stehen. Herkünfte aus dem nördlicheren und westlicheren Raum tendierten zu einem etwas zierlicheren Habitus als Herkünfte aus dem südlicheren Raum. Des Weiteren setzte das Blühstadium, zumindest tendenziell, ein wenig später ein. Die Merkmalsausprägungen ließen sich nicht mit der Feldhistorie erklären. Vermutlich haben sowohl klimatisch-geographische Faktoren als auch die langjährige Feldhistorie die Morphologie und Phänologie der Herkünfte beeinflusst. Sensitivere bzw. unsensitivere Herkünfte unterschieden sich morphologisch und phänologisch nicht voneinander. Mithilfe der Methode der RAPD-PCR wurde ein großer Teil der Herkünfte molekularbiologisch untersucht. 17 von 40 getesteten Decamer-Primern zeigten Polymorphismen an und wurden zur Berechnung der genetischen Ähnlichkeiten herangezogen. Die genetische Ähnlichkeit der G. aparine-Herkünfte einschließlich der Heckenpopulation lag zwischen 93 und 97 %. Es konnten keine eindeutigen Zusammenhänge zwischen den Ergebnissen der RAPD-PCR und der Morphologie und Phänologie sowie der Herbizidempfindlichkeit der Herkünfte nachgewiesen werden. G. aparine {{is known}} as a very {{adaptable}} and worldwide distributed plant species. It {{is one of the worst}} weed species in numerous crops causing severe problems. Occasionally, a high degree of variability of G. aparine regarding to morphological and phenological characteristics was reported as well as to its herbicide susceptibility. Because of these observations and the necessity to gain more information about the biology and ecology of this species to perform a successful control of this weed in the field the variability of G. aparine was investigated. In comparative studies 24 field populations of different origins within Europe were used. For some of these populations the history of field management for the last few years was known. Additionally to the field populations one population from a hedgerow and one population of G. spurium has been further characterized. One central aim of these studies was the determination of the susceptibility of the populations against different herbicides. Furthermore the morphology and phenology of the different populations were also characterized. The variability of selected populations was examined by RAPD-PCR, too. The results of herbicide susceptibility tests showed that field populations of G. aparine reacted differently to the various herbicides. The largest differences in susceptibility were observed for the test herbicide, where one population showed a 6, 8 -fold higher tolerance than the most susceptible population (ED 90). Low variability was detected for <b>Mecoprop-P</b> and Cinidon-ethyl, where populations differed at a factor of at most 1, 5 and 1, 7, respectively. Nearly all populations could be controlled with reduced herbicide concentrations compared to the recommended dosages. No resistant population was observed. Further, no significant differences between field populations and the hedgerow population could be detected. In several experiments the population of G. spurium tended to react slightly more susceptible towards the herbicides than G. aparine. A correlation between herbicide susceptibility and chemical control measures as described in the field history of the few past years could not be observed. The results with the test herbicide and Cinidon-ethyl might be interpreted as natural variability, because the active agents have not been on the market before sampling of the plants. Populations from adjacent fields showed as different susceptibilities as populations from distant fields, so that no regions with populations predominantly expressing significant levels of susceptibility or tolerance could be identified. The morphological and phenological tests showed that all populations differed regarding to many parameters. For most parameters the differences between the populations were in an identical range and persistently the populations differed at a maximum factor of 1, 2 - 1, 5. Higher differences than at this scale could be observed for the size of cotyledons, the number of seeds and the seminal yield. For the last parameter the largest differences could be observed with a maximum factor of 2, 4 between the population with the smallest and highest seminal yield. Further, some populations showed a stronger habit than others. In a cluster analysis the G. aparine populations were divided into four groups. There was no difference between the field populations and the hedgerow population, but the population of G. spurium was, as expected, clearly different from G. aparine. An analysis of correlation revealed correlations for several parameters. For example, an early beginning of flowering was accompanied by a higher seminal yield. Some characteristics could furthermore be correlated with the geographic origin of the populations. Populations from northern and western locations often tended to have a less stronger habit than populations from the southern regions. Furthermore the onset of flowering was delayed compared to the populations from the more southern regions. The different characteristics could not been explained with the field history of the populations. Certainly the field history as well as climatic and geographic factors may have influenced the different morphology and phenology of the populations. In summary no morphological and phenological differences were detected between more sensitive or less sensitive populations. The results of the RAPD-PCR showed that 17 out of 40 tested primers were suitable to indicate polymorphisms between the different populations. They have been used to calculate the genetic similarity of the populations. The resulting genetic similarity of the G. aparine populations including the hedgerow population was between 93 and 97 %. G. spurium differed clearly from Galium aparine. No correlations could be detected between the results of the molecular and the morphological, phenological and herbicide susceptibility tests...|$|E
