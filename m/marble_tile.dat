25|$|Thirteen steel columns, {{arranged}} in a circle {{in the center of}} the building, support the dome overhead. The columns are irregularly spaced to accommodate building's site and avoid blocking entrances. Horizontal steel beams run outward from these columns to the outer walls, supporting the upper floors. Each of the columns was coated in a thick layer of plaster, with vertical conduits and air ducts embedded and hidden in the plaster. On the first floor, the plaster-coasted columns were clad in marble, but merely painted on the second and third floors. Each of the upper floors was constructed with a concrete base, on top of which were placed brick and red tile arched supports. A wood floor was constructed atop the arched supports, and in parts of the second floor <b>marble</b> <b>tile</b> was laid atop the wood flooring. Intricate embossed bronze brackets supported the second-floor balcony. The first floor ceiling, formed by the second floor balcony, was decorated with highly detailed bronze coffers.|$|E

25|$|The Christopher Turnor {{monument}} sits on {{a black-and-white}} marble-tiled raised level. Within this level is set a worn sculpted medieval monument, supposed the early 14th-century memorial to John de Neville and his wife, with two recumbent figures—the man in chain armour, the woman with a wimple—draped from elbow to ankle and set within a sunken field. A dog lies {{at the feet of}} each figure, and a shield with three Fleur-de-lis lies partly over the man. Set into the raised floor against the north wall is a recessed table tomb with inset panels with angels holding shields, above which is a curved and moulded canopy arch with embedded fleuron repeats and a crocketed top running to a cross-shaped floriate finial. The origin of the monument is unknown. Next to the de Neville monument and set into a <b>marble</b> <b>tile</b> is a lozenge-shaped metal plaque to Florence Amy Laura Neville (died 1934 aged 85 years), daughter of Henry Martin Turnor who was the son of antiquarian Edmund Turnor (1755–1829) and brother of Christopher Turnor (1809–1886).|$|E
2500|$|Unit {{construction}} {{since its}} introduction has defined {{the development of}} the modern kitchen. Pre-manufactured modules, using mass manufacturing techniques developed during World War II, greatly brought down the cost of a kitchen. Units which are kept on the floor are called [...] "floor units", [...] "floor cabinets", or [...] "base cabinets" [...] on which a kitchen worktop – originally often formica and often now made of granite, <b>marble,</b> <b>tile</b> or wood – is placed. The units which are held on the wall for storage purposes are termed as [...] "wall units" [...] or [...] "wall cabinets". In small areas of kitchen in an apartment, even a [...] "tall storage unit" [...] is available for effective storage. In cheaper brands, all cabinets are kept a uniform color, normally white, with interchangeable doors and accessories chosen by the customer to give a varied look. In more expensive brands, the cabinets are produced matching the doors' colors and finishes, for an older more bespoke look.|$|E

40|$|International Workshop on Red Coral Science, Management, and Trade: Lessons {{from the}} Mediterranean, 23 - 26 September 2009, Naples, Italy. [...] 6 pages, 3 figuresRecovery of coral populations {{is a slow}} process, {{especially}} in Mediterranean Sea where octocorals, characterized by slow growth rates, are dominant. Until now, restoration techniques are based on transplantation, a technique requiring high degree of manipulation leading to high colony mortality. Mediterranean red coral (Corallium rubrum, L 1758) is a long-lived, slow-growing gorgonian, endemic to Mediterranean rocky shores. Its high economic value determined over-harvesting which brought many coastal, shallow-water populations to depletion. Moreover, shallow-water populations could be extremely vulnerable to mass mortality events putatively linked to global warming. Therefore, these populations need conservation and restoration actions. Due to their fragility, transplantation of adult colonies does not give any effective result. Within this framework we set out a method suitable to foster red coral recruitment on artificial, carbonatic substrates (<b>marble</b> <b>tiles),</b> following a patented protocol. This protocol allowed red coral larvae settlement and growth on <b>marble</b> <b>tiles.</b> In {{the framework of a}} study carried out in Italy with 54 100 cm 2 <b>marble</b> <b>tiles,</b> overall, 388 settlers colonized the tiles and their densities varied between 12. 37 ± 6. 1 and 2. 75 ± 2. 4 dm- 2. Even if mortality affected these colonies (24. 35 ± 9. 12 colonies % y- 1), after 4 years the tiles still harbored a persistent population (19 ± 4. 97 dm- 2) with positive net-recruitment rates (recruitment-mortality). As permanently colonized tiles may easily be removed and fixed again in new areas by a central screw, red coral re-colonization may be fostered by transferring and re-fixing tiles in areas depleted of red coral colonies. Moreover, none of the colonies settled on such tiles was affected by boring sponges, which are one of the main sources of red coral mortality and also reduce their economic value. These findings suggest <b>marble</b> <b>tiles</b> could be a useful tool both to study recruitment and to foster restoration of red coral shallow-water populationsPeer Reviewe...|$|R
