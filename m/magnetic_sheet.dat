This ex- perimental study is performed {{as a function of}} the applied magnetic field orientation, tempera- ture, and dose of implanted cobalt ions. We demonstrate that each of those <b>magnetic</b> <b>sheet</b> of cobalt nanoparticles can be well modelled by a nearly two dimensional ferromagnetic sheet hav- ing a reduced effective saturation magnetization, compared to a regular thin film of cobalt. The nanoparticles are found superparamagnetic above around 210 K and ferromagnetic below this blocking temperature. Magnetostatic calculations show that a strong magnetic field gradient of around 0. 1 G/nm could be produced by a ferromagnetic nanostripe patterned in such <b>magnetic</b> <b>sheet</b> of cobalt nanoparticles. Such a strong magnetic field gradient combined with electron para- magnetic resonance may be relevant for implementing an intermediate scale quantum computer based on arrays of coupled electron spins, as previously reported (Eur.

Different conclusions regarding the dynamic loss analysis and its decomposition into the classical and excess loss components correspondingly emerge. In this paper we discuss detailed investigations on the broadband energy loss versus frequency behavior in different non-oriented Fe-Si and low-carbon steel sheets.

The spiral accumulating core system is suitable for manufacturing the core more ecologically because in this system more than 50 % of the <b>magnetic</b> steel <b>sheet</b> can be used. However, since the spiral accumulating core has many slits and embossing interlockings, the equivalent Young's modulus is not known. In this study, therefore, the equivalent Young's modulus of the spiral accumulating core is considered in order to find out a good method to fix the core. Here, the finite element method is applied to analyze the permanent magnet motor core, whose layers and slits are periodically arranged. Then, the effects of slits, layers and embossing interlockings on equivalent Young's modulus are discussed. It is found that around the slits the core layer should be considered to have zero elastic modulus because no tangential stress exists. Finally, a convenient method of calculation based on rule of mixture is newly proposed to estimate the equivalent Young's modulus efficiently...|$|R
