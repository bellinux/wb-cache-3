40|$|Abstract: Aeration is {{the process}} by which the area of contact between water and air is increased, either by natural methods or by <b>mechanical</b> devices. Proper <b>aeration</b> can make {{considerable}} improvements in a pond ecosystem. This paper investigates pond aeration by two phase flow systems such as high head gated conduit flow systems and two phase pipe flow systems using venturi tubes. When the gate of a high head outlet conduit is partly opened or a minimal amount of differential pressure exists between the inlet and outlet sides of the venturi tube, air suction occurs at air vents. In two phase flow systems, air that is entrained into the water will be momentarily forced downstream in the form of small air bubbles. The dissolution of oxygen into the water results from the air suction downstream of high head gated conduit and venturi tube, and the rising air bubbles into pond. Moreover, high pressure in two phase flow systems also facilitates the dissolution of oxygen into the water. Therefore, two phase flow systems have an extremely high efficiency for transferring oxygen from air bubbles to water. It was observed from the results that two phase flow systems were more efficient in deep ponds than in shallow ponds...|$|R

INTERVENTIONS MEASUREMENTS: 88 patients from 2 intensive care units were included in this observational prospective study. Plasma sRAGE levels were measured in duplicate by ELISA before, {{at the end of a}} 60 -minute SBT, and 4 hours after extubation. To quantify lung aeration, a lung ultrasound score was calculated. 34 % of extubated patients experienced postextubation distress. Patients with or without postextubation distress had comparable sRAGE levels before SBT, after SBT, and 4 hours after extubation. In patients with postextubation distress, sRAGE levels were not predictive of the need for mechanical ventilation. sRAGE levels were not associated with lung aeration as assessed by echography. Patients who succeeded SBT (86 %) and those who failed (14 %) had no differences in sRAGE levels, before (median 1111 vs 1021 pg/mL, p =  0, 87) and at the end of SBT (1165 vs 1038 pg/mL, p =  0. 74).

40|$|Background A recent method determines {{regional}} {{gas flow}} of the lung by electrical impedance tomography (EIT). The {{aim of this study}} is to show the applicability of this method in a porcine model of mechanical ventilation in healthy and diseased lungs. Our primary hypothesis is that global gas flow measured by EIT can be correlated with spirometry. Our secondary hypothesis is that regional analysis of respiratory gas flow delivers physiologically meaningful results. Methods In two sets of experiments n[*]=[*] 7 healthy pigs and n[*]=[*] 6 pigs before and after induction of lavage lung injury were investigated. EIT of the lung and spirometry were registered synchronously during ongoing <b>mechanical</b> ventilation. In-vivo <b>aeration</b> of the lung was analysed in four regions-of-interest (ROI) by EIT: 1) global, 2) ventral (non-dependent), 3) middle and 4) dorsal (dependent) ROI. Respiratory gas flow was calculated by the first derivative of the regional aeration curve. Four phases of the respiratory cycle were discriminated. They delivered peak and late inspiratory and expiratory gas flow (PIF, LIF, PEF, LEF) characterizing early or late inspiration or expiration. Results Linear regression analysis of EIT and spirometry in healthy pigs revealed a very good correlation measuring peak flow and a good correlation detecting late flow. PIFEIT[*]=[*] 0. 702 [*]·[*]PIFspiro[*]+[*] 117. 4, r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 809; PEFEIT[*]=[*] 0. 690 [*]·[*]PEFspiro- 124. 2, r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 760; LIFEIT[*]=[*] 0. 909 [*]·[*]LIFspiro[*]+[*] 27. 32, r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 572 and LEFEIT[*]=[*] 0. 858 [*]·[*]LEFspiro- 10. 94, r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 647. EIT derived absolute gas flow was generally smaller than data from spirometry. Regional gas flow was distributed heterogeneously during different phases of the respiratory cycle. But, the regional distribution of gas flow stayed stable during different ventilator settings. Moderate lung injury changed the regional pattern of gas flow.

To measure oxygen consumption, shrimps were placed in a semi-open respirometry system. Results demonstrate that temperature, salinity, shrimp size and the interaction of these parameters significantly influence the specific oxygen consumption (mg O 2 g- 1 h- 1). The 2 -g shrimp perhaps suffered osmotic stress and consumed more oxygen at salinity 37 , whereas 6 and 12 -g shrimp suffered such stress at salinity 1 . At 25 and 30 ºC oxygen consumption was more stable at salinities 13 and 25  for all groups. At 20 ºC and salinity below 25  oxygen consumption was higher, possibly due to the reduced hyperosmoregulatory ability in lower temperatures. The resulting regression equations allowed the calculation of L. vannamei shrimp oxygen consumption at the temperatures, salinities and sizes tested in this study.

40|$|The {{effect of}} steady {{shearing}} versus z-blade mixing on <b>mechanical</b> <b>aeration</b> and gas retaining {{ability of the}} dough during processing and subsequent proofing and bread baking stages was investigated. Reduction in moisture content led to reduction in both static and dynamic densities of z-blade mixed dough. At low moisture content, dough had higher consistency and tended to physically entrap more air bubbles upon processing, leading to a higher dough volume and, thereby a low density. The results showed that both processes led to similar <b>mechanical</b> <b>aeration</b> as measured by static dough density immediately after processing. Shearing at a low rotational speed, led to similar proofing dough volume as z-blade mixing did. Nevertheless, both dough expansion test and breadmaking trials showed {{a significant reduction in}} gas retaining ability of sheared dough, especially at higher rotational speeds.

40|$|Two {{problems}} on optimization {{of fresh water}} management in porous media soil systems were investigated. The first problem dealt {{with the use of}} surface barriers on tile-drained land during leaching operations. The barriers were designed to prevent direct flow to underlying tile drains and make leaching more efficient. The 0. 1 m diameter tile drains were imbedded in an impermeable layer 2 m below the ground surface and drain spacings of 4, 8 and 16 m were investigated. Calculations were made for surface barriers that covered 25, 50 and 75 percent of the land for each case of tile spacing. Comparisons were made with cases of simple ponding with no barriers. A modified Gram-Schmidt method was used to generate constants for the normalized head equation in polar coordinates that described the system. Flow nets of equipotentials and streamlines for the flow areas were constructed and leaching fronts were added to the flow nets. An optimization technique, involving sequenced operations with and without surface barriers in place, to leach the flow area to a depth of 1 m was presented. Calculated results showed that the barriers reduced ponding times by factors of 2. 0 and greater and water usage by factors of 2. 5 and greater, over simple ponding for the cases of 8 m and 16 m tile spacings. The barriers were of no advantage for the cases of 4 m tile spacings;The second problem dealt with optimizing a seedbed for planting maize (Zea mays, L.) on the sides of sloped ridges and was a field study which compared an optimized seedbed with other seedbeds for emergence rates, stands and yields of maize. In the optimized seedbed, high compaction of the soil next to the seeds was theorized to increase upward flows of capillary moisture. The seedbed was in a ridge where excess water would drain away from the seeds. The sloped-ridge seedbed was also optimized for temperature by sloping the planted surface toward the spring sun for maximum energy interception. Optimization for <b>mechanical</b> impedance and <b>aeration</b> was by leaving the soil over the seeds uncompacted. Four years of results of replicated field tests are presented.

40|$|The {{investigations}} here reported {{were designed}} to study the comparative physiological characteristics of Quercus robur, Betula pendula seedlings as influenced by aspects of soil and light environments. A comparative soil type experiment using a tropical fast-growing tree (Terminalia ivorensis) {{in addition to the}} temperate trees was also possible. These experiments were set up to explore the limiting factors responsible for failure of natural regeneration. The first experiment involved using an artificial growing medium (peralite) fed with different types of culture solutions for the growth of the seedlings. The role of nitrogen, phosphorus, and complete absence of nutrients on seedlings was examined. Q. robur was more sensitive to nitrogen deficiency than to that of phosphorus. Q. robur seedlings performed similarly in absence of phosphorus and in complete presence of nutrients. B. pendula seedlings on the other hand were seriously affected by the deficiency of both elements and phosphorus seemed more important than nitrogen to B. pendula seedling growth. Chemical analyses showed evidence of nitrogen deficiency in both species. In Q. robur phosphorus did not show any marked inbalance. B. pendula seedlings in a number of treatments were too small for any detailed analysis. The chemical analyses also confirmed the acorn as a main source of nutrient supply of young seedlings of Q. robur. Dry matter yield of Q. robur was not affected by soil volume variation, while B. pendula seedlings had growth performances almost proportional to the soil volume available. An attempt to distinguish the separate effects of <b>mechanical</b> impendance and <b>aeration</b> gave no clear-cut result. The soil type experiment was designed to investigate the role of soil factors on the seedling growth of Q. robur, B. pendula and T. ivorensis. Only B. pendula seemed able to grow on a calcareous soil, robur did not produce new shoots at all, while a number of T. ivorensis seedlings died on this calcareous soil. The growth of all seedlings on two other soil types (acidic) was relatively poor. These soils were generally poor in major soil nutrients especially nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. The fourth soil type from under a rich mixture of B. pendula and Q. robur trees produced good growth of seedlings generally. The soil was rich in the major soil elements. The analysis of plant growth showed that the three species were affected by ontogenetic drift. B. pendula had the highest relative growth rates in all soil types, and Q. robur the least. Due {{to the nature of the}} different soils, the relative growth rates of the seedlings were markedly affected. On the calcareous soil, Q. robur and T. ivorensis showed no dry weight increase after transplanting. On the soil type IV the species had high growth rates which fell with time. These results indicate that soil factors may affect the distribution of Q. robur and B. pendula, although other factors were also thought to interact with soil nutrients. The effects of shade and fertilizer on the seedling growth of Q. robur and B. pendula was investigated by growing these seedlings in shaded enclosures providing 30 %, 10 % and 5 % approximately of total daylight. The soil condition on which the seedlings were growing vas also varied by growing some seedlings in ordinary garden soil and others in garden soil mixed with a level of John Innes fertilizer. Q. robur was not influenced by the fertilizer treatment. The fertilizer addition was significant to the B. pendula seedling only in the 20 % light and only towards the end of the season. The fertilizer effect was also thought to have increased the susceptibility of B. pendula seedlings to fungal attack in the light. B. pendula showed adaptation to shading by increasing specific leaf area. The experiment on various degrees of shading on B. pendula seedlings previously grown in 100 % daylight helped to clarify some points about this species under shade. The results of the specific leaf area values increasing with shade confirms the fact that B. pendula might probably withstand some shading if for example it was able to put up some growth under a temporarily open canopy. The results also indicate the fact that B. pendula would respond favourably to fertilizer application at this seedling stage, if the light condition is adequate. The performance of B. pendula seedlings in 25 % and 85 % daylight were quite comparable. In conclusion, it was believed that light was the major important factor of the environment affecting natural regeneration of Q. robur and B. pendula seedlings in British semi-natural forests, except in certain types of soils, for example on certain calcareous soils. Further studies on these seedlings especially in relation to their herbaceous competitors was recommended. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.) <p...|$|R

40|$|Treating {{wastewater}} {{is imperative}} for maintaining {{public health and}} sanitation {{as well as the}} natural environment. In the United States and developed countries around the globe, the activated sludge (AS) process has been paramount in effectively treating wastewater for over a century. However, high energy consumption due to required <b>mechanical</b> <b>aeration</b> of AS limits its potential as a sustainable process. The oxygenic photogranule (OPG) wastewater treatment process utilizes the photosynthetic ability of OPGs made possible by the symbiosis between heterotrophic AS and filamentous cyanobacteria and algae in dense, spherical biogranules. This research presents pilot operation of the OPG wastewater treatment process, supporting its scalability and effective nutrients removal. Four pilot OPG reactors were operated in sequencing batch reactor (SBR) mode with alternating light/dark cycles, achieving a maximum volume of 30 L (20 -times scale-up factor) and maximum operation time of 152 days. Pilots A 2 ̆ 6 B (Phase I) and Pilot D (Phase III) achieved soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) removal efficiencies of 65...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{determining}} {{the effects of}} the interaction between afternoon aeration and stocking density of Nile tilapia on variables of water and soil quality, growth performance and effluent quality. The experiment was a 3 x 2 factorial randomized block design, with three stocking densities (8, 12 and 16 fish per tank or 43. 5, 65. 3, and 87. 0 g m- 3) under two <b>mechanical</b> <b>aeration</b> regimes, absence (control; three replicates) and afternoon aeration (four replicates). The afternoon aeration was carried out from 12. 00 a. m. up to 18. 00 p. m. from the 3 rd week {{until the end of the}} experiment. Except for the 16 -fish tanks, the lowest concentrations of total ammonia nitrogen were found in the tanks with higher density of fish provided with afternoon aeration. Nitrite concentrations were lower in the 8 -fish aerated tanks. In intensive system, the afternoon aeration of the fish culture water is an efficient management of water quality to remove gaseous ammonia and nitrite from water, but it is not appropriate to remove hydrogen sulfide from water. ...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the 2007 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 27 - 29, 2007, Athens, Georgia. The poultry {{industry}} {{is an important}} component of agricultural production in the Southern Piedmont of Georgia. Associated manures are typically surface-applied to pastures as a fertilizer for forages. However, this surface application of manures allows phosphorus (P) to accumulate at the soil surface and runoff to become contaminated with P and to transport it to surface waters. As such, a study was conducted to examine the conservation potential of <b>mechanical</b> <b>aeration</b> of grasslands. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>aeration</b> has potential to reduce P transport by partially incorporating applied manures, allowing for more P adsorption by the soil, increasing infiltration by breaking the soil surface, and by slowing runoff flow by increasing the roughness of the landscape. We examined the effects of four aeration treatments (aeration with cores, “no-till” disk aeration perpendicular to the slope, aeration with spikes, and no aeration treatment) on the export of dissolved reactive P (DRP) in surface runoff from grasslands with two nutrient treatments (broiler litter and a control of no manure). Plots (0. 75 x 2 m) were established on a Cecil soil series with mixed tall fescue/bermudagrass vegetation on 8 to 12 % slopes. Plots were then aerated and manures applied at a rate of 30 kg P ha- 1, prior to simulated rainfall at a rate of 75 mm h- 1. While aeration had minimal impact on volume of runoff, core aeration decreased DRP loads (P < 0. 05) from applied broiler litter by 61 %. Given that Cecil soil is common in pastures receiving broiler litter in the Southern Piedmont, these results suggest that core aeration could have a widespread impact on water quality in the Southern Piedmont region.

40|$|Typescript"Approved May 15, 1912, George M. Reed"M. A. University of Missouri 1912 Salt-rising {{bread is}} a kind of leavened bread, which is made light not by the {{introduction}} of yeast, as with yeast cakes or by <b>mechanical</b> <b>aeration</b> or by carbon dioxide liberated from chemical compounds, such as baking powders, but by some ferment which is present in the ingredients used in starting the bread. The most marked characteristics of it are its texture, odor and flavor. The texture is very close and fine, yet the bread is light. The odor and flavor are especially characteristic, being rather penetrating. This odor which suggests putrefaction is unpleasant to some people. The flavor is slightly sweet but peculiar and characteristic. It is because the outcome is so uncertain in the making of salt-rising bread and because no scientific work on the subject has been done, that this work was undertaken. It was thought that if some definite knowledge of the organisms concerned in the making of salt-rising bread were obtained, results could be made more certain, and thus make this process of bread making more accessible to a larger number of people.

40|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>aeration</b> is {{critical}} to sewage sludge bio-drying, and the actual water loss caused by aeration can be better understood from investigations {{of the relationship between}} aeration and water evaporation from the sewage sludge bio-drying pile based on in situ measurements. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of forced air volume on the evaporation of water from a sewage sludge bio-drying pile. Dewatered sewage sludge was bio-dried using control technology for bio-drying, during which time the temperature, superficial air velocity and water evaporation were measured and calculated. The results indicated that the peak air velocity and water evaporation occurred in the thermophilic phase and second temperature-increasing phase, with the highest values of 0. 0630. 027 ms- 1 and 28. 9 kgton- 1 matrix d- 1, respectively, being observed on day 4. Air velocity above the pile during aeration was 43 - 100 % higher than when there was no aeration, and there was a significantly positive correlation between air volume and water evaporation from day 1 to 15. The order of daily means of water evaporation was thermophilic phase>second temperature-increasing phase>temperature-increasing phase>cooling phase. Forced aeration controlled the pile temperature and improved evaporation, making it the key factor influencing water loss during the process of sewage sludge bio-drying. 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

Three sediment samples were collected from each lake along a transect (from a probable point of stormwater addition to the opposite shore), and were composited on an equal weight basis prior to analysis. Total petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations ranged from 30 to 8000 mg /kg dry weight. The concentration ranges (mg /kg dry weight) of total metals were: arsenic 7 - 26, copper 25 - 2800, chromium 14 - 55, nickel 5 - 40, lead < 1 - 138, selenium < 0. 5 - 1. 1, and zinc 33 - 239.

40|$|The use {{of thermal}} mixing {{by means of}} {{compressed}} air appears to have important potential for evaporation suppression on deep reservoirs. Current methods used to reduce evaporation from open-water impoundments such as floating covers, modular covers, monolayers and shade structures have many disadvantages and negative impacts on the environment. These methods impact the natural/modified aquatic ecosystem established in the dam; alter aesthetic qualities; {{increase the risk of}} dam failure in times of flood; could potentially lead to an oxygen reduction in the water; and may compromise the natural water treatment functions and operations such as the reduction of harmful bacteria, exposure to sunlight (form of disinfection) and natural and <b>mechanical</b> <b>aeration</b> thereby increasing treatment costs. The methodology proposed in this paper to help reduce evaporation losses from open-water impoundments, which indirectly addresses problems of water shortage and the associated economic impacts, involves the destratification of the water body using a bubble plume operated with minimal energy input to reduce surface water temperatures, with, a subsequent reduction in evaporation. The literature, although limited, indicates that this proposed method has merit and requires further research to identify specific reservoirs (size, depth, usage) that could benefit from such a destratification system. Evaporation suppression of as high as 30 % was achieved in some case studies...|$|E
