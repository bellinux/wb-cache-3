30|$|Bond {{resistance}} of reinforcing bars {{embedded in concrete}} depends primarily on frictional resistance and <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock.</b> Chemical adhesion provides withholding property between steel and concrete. Frictional bond provides initial resistance against loading and further loading mobilizes the <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> between the concrete and bar ribs. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>interlocks</b> lead to inclined bearing forces which in turn lead to transverse tensile stresses and internal inclined splitting (bond) cracks along reinforcing bars. These cracks are commonly referred as Goto cracks (Goto 1971).|$|R

50|$|Ascot {{railway station}} {{is the last}} station in {{metropolitan}} Brisbane to retain semaphore signalling and a mechanically <b>interlocked</b> signal <b>cabin,</b> {{and is one of}} only seven such systems intact in Queensland. In 2008 the seven mechanically <b>interlocked</b> signal <b>cabins</b> still commissioned were Ascot (not used), Charters Towers, Ingham, Innisfail, Kuranda, Laidley (rarely used) and Mackay. There are about 19 surviving decommissioned <b>interlocked</b> signal <b>cabins</b> complete with their frames in Queensland (six have been relocated), along with 36 signal cabins minus their signal frames, and 10 known signal frames in various states of intactness. Approximately 100 mechanically <b>interlocked</b> signal <b>cabins</b> have been demolished at stations around Queensland.|$|R
50|$|Although Ipswich {{was only}} the second station in Queensland to have <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> installed, it was {{retained}} long after its withdrawal from Roma Street.

30|$|Therefore, {{the major}} {{contributing}} factors to the bond formed during this densification {{may be the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> of the fibres of the biomass and adhesive force between the particles. Increase in fibre length of the biomass raw material resulting from increased particle size could lead to <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> of relatively longer fibres [14] which, therefore, result {{in the formation of}} a stronger bond and increased compressive strength in cleft. Additionally, a strong significant positive correlation between compressive strength in cleft and compacting pressure of briquettes produced was established (Pearson’s r = 0.670, p-value = 0.000; N = 450; 1 -tailed, α = 0.05). This result means that the compressive strength in cleft of the briquettes produced increased with increasing compacting pressure. Increased compacting pressure result in increased binding force between the particles [13]. The increase in binding force resulted from increased <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> of sawdust particle as well as increased adhesion between the particles [6].|$|R

40|$|Synopsis: This study {{presents}} the results of experiments performed on RC (Reinforced Concrete) beams strengthened with NSM(Near Surface Mounted) reinforcement. A total of 8 specimens have been tested. The specimens can be classified into EBR(Externally Bonded Reinforcement) specimens and NSM(Near Surface Mounted) reinforcements specimens. Two of NSM specimens were strengthened with 12 <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> grooves with a width of 20 mm and spacing of 200 mm in order to prevent debonding failure of the CFRP(Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer) reinforcement. Experimental results revealed that NSM specimens used CFRP reinforcements more efficiently than the EBR specimens, but debonding failure between adhesive and concrete occurred. This showed that, similarly to EBR specimens, NSM specimens also required countermeasures against debonding failure. Failure mode of NSM specimens added with <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> grooves failed by rupture of CFRP rod and strip. The measured ultimate load showed an increase of 15 % compared with the common NSM specimens. The application of <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> grooves made it possible to avoid debonding failure and to enhance strengthening performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} surface-hardening {{processes}} on {{the changes in}} surface characteristics and adhesion of black copper oxide substrate with epoxy resins are studied. Various techniques, namely SEM, XPS, AFM, XRD, Auger electron spectroscopy, contact angle goniometry, D-SIMS and RBS, were used to identify the changes in surface characteristics. Dense, fibrillar cupric oxide crystals characterized the as-deposited oxide coating with high surface roughness. The surface-hardening process flattened and consolidated the fibrils without changing the compositional and thermodynamic characteristics of the coated surface. The surface-hardening process reduced the total thickness of copper oxide by approximately 50 - 150 nm. The reduction in oxide thickness was not a predominant factor for the reduced bond strength of the surface-hardened coating. The bond strengths of both the as-deposited and surface-hardened black oxide coatings increased with oxidation time, until saturation at about 120 - 150 s. For the as-deposited oxide coating, <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking,</b> high wettability and resistance to surface contamination are the three major sources for improved adhesion, amongst which the enhanced <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> provided by the fibrillar cupric oxide is the most important. Surface hardening reduced the efficiency of <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> mechanism. There was close functional dependence between the button-shear strength and Surface characteristics, such as surface roughness, coating thickness and surface free energy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe metal was locally {{structured}} by {{pulsed laser}} radiation producing microscopic patterns on its surface. In a second step {{the opposite side}} of the micro-structured metal was irradiated by a continuous wave (CW) fiber laser to achieve the <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> between the two materials. A tight relationship between the microstructure parameters and pull-out test performance was observed. The greatest strength was achieved when the distance between subsequent grooves was minimized. The T-joint mechanical performance did not reveal any significant dependence on the considered range of joining areas. The morphological and topographical features of the detached surfaces showed that the micro-structured grooves were completely filled during the laser conductive joining process. Different alignment angles of patterns produced different failure modes although there was no evidence of an additional <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock...</b>|$|R
