50|$|<b>Macroglossia,</b> a large tongue, is a {{very common}} (>90%) and {{prominent}} feature of BWS. Infants with BWS and <b>macroglossia</b> typically cannot fully close their mouth {{in front of their}} large tongue, causing it to protrude out. <b>Macroglossia</b> in BWS becomes less noticeable with age and often requires no treatment; but it does cause problems for some children with BWS. In severe cases, <b>macroglossia</b> can cause respiratory, feeding, and speech difficulties. Children with BWS and significant <b>macroglossia</b> should be evaluated by a craniofacial team.|$|E
5000|$|The ICD-10 lists <b>macroglossia</b> under [...] "other {{congenital}} malformations of the digestive system". Definitions of <b>macroglossia</b> have been proposed, including [...] "a tongue that protrudes beyond the teeth during [...] resting posture" [...] and [...] "if {{there is an}} impression of a tooth on the lingual border when the patients slightly open their mouths". Others have suggested there is no objective definition of what constitutes <b>macroglossia.</b> Some propose a distinction between true <b>macroglossia,</b> when histologic abnormalities correlate with the clinical findings of tongue enlargement, and relative <b>macroglossia,</b> where histology {{does not provide a}} pathologic explanation for the enlargement. Common examples of true <b>macroglossia</b> are vascular malformations, muscular enlargement and tumors; whilst Down syndrome is an example of relative <b>macroglossia.</b> Pseudomacryglossia refers to a tongue that is of normal size but gives a false impression of being too large in relation to adjacent anatomical structures. The Myer classification subdivides <b>macroglossia</b> into generalized or localized.|$|E
50|$|<b>Macroglossia</b> is uncommon, {{and usually}} occurs in children. <b>Macroglossia</b> has been {{reported}} to have a positive family history in 6% of cases. The National Organization of Rare Disorders lists <b>macroglossia</b> as a rare disease (less than 200 000 individuals in the US).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Macroglossia</b> - an {{abnormally}} large tongue, seen in some {{disorders such as}} Down syndrome (although <b>macroglossia</b> can be {{an acquired}} condition as well).|$|E
50|$|<b>Macroglossia</b> {{is usually}} {{diagnosed}} clinically. Sleep endoscopy and imaging {{may be used}} for assessment of obstructive sleep apnea. The initial evaluation of all patients with <b>macroglossia</b> may involve abdominal ultrasound and molecular studies for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.|$|E
50|$|<b>Macroglossia</b> is {{the medical}} term for {{an unusually large}} tongue. Severe {{enlargement}} of the tongue can cause cosmetic and functional difficulties in speaking, eating, swallowing and sleeping. <b>Macroglossia</b> is uncommon, and usually occurs in children. There are many causes. Treatment is dependent upon the exact cause.|$|E
50|$|Amyloidosis is an {{accumulation}} of insoluble proteins in tissues that impedes normal function. This can be a cause of <b>macroglossia</b> if amyloid is deposited in the tissues of the tongue, which gives it a nodular appearance. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a rare hereditary condition, which may include other defects such as omphalocele, visceromegaly, gigantism or neonatal hypoglycemia.The tongue may show a diffuse, smooth generalized enlargement. The face may show maxillary hypoplasia causing relative mandibular prognathism. Apparent <b>macroglossia</b> can also occur in Down syndrome. The tongue has a papillary, fissured surface. <b>Macroglossia</b> {{may be a sign}} of hypothyroid disorders.|$|E

50|$|As {{patients}} {{pass into}} adolescence, the syndrome {{is characterized by}} a coarse and flat face, <b>macroglossia,</b> prognathism, inverted lower lip, and psychomotor retardation with muscular hypertonia and contractures.|$|E
50|$|<b>Macroglossia</b> may {{be caused}} by a wide variety of {{congenital}} and acquired conditions. Isolated <b>macroglossia</b> has no determinable cause. The most common causes of tongue enlargement are vascular malformations (e.g. lymphangioma or hemangioma) and muscular hypertrophy (e.g. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or hemihyperplasia). Enlargement due to lymphangioma gives the tongue a pebbly appearance with multiple superficial dilated lymphatic channels. Enlargement due to hemihyperplasia is unilateral. In edentulous persons, a lack of teeth leaves more room for the tongue to expand into laterally, which can create problems with wearing dentures and may cause pseudomacroglossia.|$|E
50|$|Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, {{caused by}} {{abnormal}} methylation in the maternal ICE region, causing Igf2 overexpression. Symptoms include accelerated growth, abnormal growth (hemihyperplasia), abdominal wall defects, <b>macroglossia,</b> hypoglycemia, kidney abnormalities, and large abdominal organs.|$|E
50|$|Children with BWS for {{the most}} part had no {{significant}} delays when compared to their siblings. However, some children with BWS do have speech problems that could be related to <b>macroglossia</b> or hearing loss.|$|E
50|$|It is {{characterized}} by variable reductions in serum immunoglobulin levels which cause most ICF patients to succumb to infectious diseases before adulthood. ICF syndrome patients exhibit facial anomalies which include hypertelorism, low-set ears, epicanthal folds and <b>macroglossia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Given the {{variation}} among individuals with BWS {{and the lack}} of a simple diagnostic test, identifying BWS can be difficult. In an attempt to standardize the classification of BWS, DeBaun et al. have defined a child as having BWS if the child has been diagnosed by a physician as having BWS and if the child has {{at least two of the}} five common features associated with BWS (<b>macroglossia,</b> macrosomia, midline abdominal wall defects, ear creases/ear pits, neonatal hypoglycemia). [...] Another definition presented by Elliot et al. includes the presence of either three major features (anterior abdominal wall defect, <b>macroglossia,</b> or prepostnatal overgrowth) or two major plus three minor findings (ear pits, nevus flammeus, neonatal hypoglycemia, nephromegaly, or hemihyperplasia).|$|E
50|$|It is not {{a disease}} as such, but usually results from habits where the tongue is pressed against the lingual {{surfaces}} (the side facing the tongue) of the dental arches, or from any cause of <b>macroglossia</b> (enlarged tongue), which in itself has many causes such as Down syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, Dr. John Bruce Beckwith, an American {{pathologist}} and Dr. Hans-Rudolf Wiedemann, a German pediatrician, independently {{reported cases}} of a proposed new syndrome. [...] Originally termed EMG syndrome (for exomphalos, <b>macroglossia,</b> and gigantism), this syndrome over time became known as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or Wiedemann Beckwith syndrome.|$|E
50|$|The {{best time}} to perform surgery for a large tongue is not known. Some {{surgeons}} recommend performing the surgery between 3 and 6 months of age. Surgery for <b>macroglossia</b> involves removing {{a small part of}} the tongue so that it fits within the mouth to allow for proper jaw and tooth development.|$|E
50|$|Most {{children}} with BWS {{do not have}} all of these five features. In addition, some {{children with}} BWS have other findings including: nevus flammeus, prominent occiput, midface hypoplasia, hemihypertrophy, genitourinary anomalies (enlarged kidneys), cardiac anomalies, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and hearing loss. Also, some premature newborns with BWS do not have <b>macroglossia</b> until closer to their anticipated delivery date.|$|E

50|$|There are not {{systematic}} reviews or randomized clinical control trials {{related to}} correction of open bite with partial tongue glossectomy but several case reports {{have been published}} indicating successful treatment of open bite with this surgical approach. <b>Macroglossia</b> {{has been reported to}} cause open bite and bimaxillary protrusion and is also known to be make orthodontic treatment unstable after its completion.|$|E
50|$|The main {{clinical}} findings include floppy baby appearance, delayed motor milestones {{and feeding}} difficulties. Moderate hepatomegaly may be present. Facial features include <b>macroglossia,</b> wide open mouth, wide open eyes, nasal flaring (due to respiratory distress), and poor facial muscle tone. Cardiopulmonary involvement is manifested by increased respiratory rate, use of accessory muscles for respiration, recurrent chest infections, decreased air {{entry in the}} left lower zone (due to cardiomegaly), arrhythmias and evidence of heart failure.|$|E
50|$|Infants {{born with}} {{congenital}} hypothyroidism may show no effects, or may display mild effects that often go unrecognized as a problem: excessive sleeping, reduced interest in nursing, poor muscle tone, low or hoarse cry, infrequent bowel movements, exaggerated jaundice, and low body temperature. If fetal deficiency was severe because of complete absence (athyreosis) of the gland, physical features may include a larger anterior fontanel, persistence of a posterior fontanel, an umbilical hernia, {{and a large}} tongue (<b>macroglossia).</b>|$|E
50|$|Treatment and {{prognosis}} of <b>macroglossia</b> {{depends upon}} its cause, and also upon {{the severity of}} the enlargement and symptoms it is causing. No treatment may be required for mild cases or cases with minimal symptoms. Speech therapy may be beneficial, or surgery {{to reduce the size of}} the tongue (reduction glossectomy). Treatment may also involve correction of orthodontic abnormalities that may have been caused by the enlarged tongue. Treatment of any underlying systemic disease may be required, e.g. radiotherapy.|$|E
50|$|Originally, Dr. Hans-Rudolf Wiedemann (born 16 February 1915, Bremen, Germany, died 4 August 2006, Kiel) {{coined the}} term exomphalos-macroglossia-gigantism (EMG) {{syndrome}} to describe the combination of congenital abdominal wall defects as hernia (exomphalos), large tongues (<b>macroglossia),</b> and large bodies and/or long limbs (gigantism). Over time, this constellation was renamed Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome following the autoptical observations of Prof. John Bruce Beckwith (born 18 September 1933, Spokane, Washington), who also observed a severe increase {{in the size of}} the adrenal glands in some of these patients.|$|E
5000|$|Dental open bite {{occurs in}} {{patients}} where the anterior teeth fail to touch. However, {{this is not}} accompanied by the skeletal tendency of having an open bite. Thus this type of open bite may happen in patients who have horizontal or hypodivergent growth pattern. These patients have normal jaw growth {{and do not have}} the long face syndrome. The anterior open bite in these patients may be caused by <b>Macroglossia,</b> Tongue thrusting habit or digit sucking habits. Some of the characteristics of a dental open bite include: ...|$|E
5000|$|Factors {{that can}} {{contribute}} to tongue thrusting include <b>macroglossia</b> (enlarged tongue), thumb sucking, large tonsils, hereditary factors, ankyloglossia (tongue tie), and certain types of artificial nipples used in feeding infants, also allergies or nasal congestion can cause the tongue to lie low in the mouth because of breathing obstruction and finally contributing to tongue thrusting. In addition, it is also seen after prolonged therapy by levodopa in Parkinsonism, also it occurs as extra pyramidal side effect (Acute muscular dystonia) after use of Neuroleptics (Anti-Psychotics).|$|E
50|$|All {{sides of}} the tongue are assessed. To inspect the dorsal side (top) of the tongue, a patient sticks out their tongue. A healthy dorsal tongue is symmetrical, pink, moist, {{slightly}} rough from the papillae, possibly with a thin, whitish coating. The {{sides of the}} tongue are inspected with a gloved hand holding a piece of gauze. The tongue is moved side to side and inspected; it should be pink, moist, smooth and glistening. Assessment of the ventral (bottom) surface of the tongue is done by having the patient touch the tip of their tongue against the roof of their mouth. If healthy, it should have prominent veins and be pink, smooth, moist, glistening and free of lesions. The frenulum should be centered under the tongue. Abnormal findings includes marked redness, cyanosis or extreme pallor. Diseases include scrotal or fissured tongue, migratory glossitis (geographic tongue), atrophic glossitis, black hairy tongue, caviar lesions, carcinoma, <b>macroglossia,</b> candidiasis, aphthous ulcer and leukoplakia.|$|E
50|$|Since 1996, it {{has been}} known that {{patients}} with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) have mutations in GPC3. Because this is an X-linked syndrome, it appears to affect males more significantly than females. While the phenotype associated with this condition can vary from mild to lethal, common symptoms include <b>macroglossia,</b> cleft palate, syndactyly, polydactyly, cystic and dysplastic kidneys, congenital heart defects, and a distinct facial appearance. Additional symptoms/characteristics have also been noted. Overall, these symptoms/characteristics are distinguished by prenatal and post-natal overgrowth. Typically, patients identified with SGBS have point mutations or microdeletions in the gene encoding GPC3, and the mutations can occur in multiple different locations of the gene. No correlation has been noticed between {{the location of the}} GPC3 mutation and the phenotypic manifestation of this disease. therefore, it is inferred that SGBS results due to a nonfunctional GPC3 protein. Researchers currently speculate that GPC3 is a negative regulator of cell proliferation, and this would explain why patients with SGBS experience overgrowth. Studies on mice support this speculation.|$|E
