5|$|As Kepler-8b orbits its star, it {{demonstrates}} the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, {{in which the}} host star's spectrum becomes red- and, later, blueshifted, as a body transits it. The identification of this effect established Kepler-8b as orbiting in a prograde motion (as opposed to retrograde <b>motion,</b> <b>in</b> which a planet orbits in a direction opposite of its star's rotation).|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Meijaard, et al., {{published}} the canonical linearized equations of <b>motion,</b> <b>in</b> the Proceedings of the Royal Society A, along with verification by two different methods. These equations assumed the tires to roll without slip, {{that is to}} say, to go where they point, and the rider to be rigidly attached to the rear frame of the bicycle.|$|E
5|$|Linear motions (or {{translatory}} motions), which {{move in a}} {{line between}} two points. Rectilinear motion is <b>motion</b> <b>in</b> a straight line between two points, whereas curvilinear motion is motion following a curved path.|$|E

30|$|Therefore, the rupture {{process of}} the main shock of the Kumamoto {{earthquake}} was investigated in this study based on the inversion of strong ground <b>motions,</b> <b>in</b> particular the generation of strong ground <b>motions</b> <b>in</b> the frequency range relevant to structural damage.

5|$|A <b>motion</b> <b>in</b> the House {{to extend}} Canada's mission in Afghanistan by two years was successful. The motion was {{supported}} by the Conservatives and 30 Liberal MPs, allowing it to narrowly pass 149–145 on May 17, 2006. Even outside of government bills, the Prime Minister's support of Canada's action has been a recurring topic, gaining him both supporters and critics among the Canadian population. On March 13, 2008, the mission was further extended until July 2011 by a vote of 197–77, with Conservative and Liberal MPs in favour, and Bloc and NDP MPs opposed.|$|E
30|$|The {{first three}} modes of the nano-manipulator are the linear <b>motions</b> <b>in</b> the x- and y-axes and the angular motion about the z-axis.

5|$|As {{with all}} of his Brushstrokes works, it is in part a satirical {{response}} to the gestural painting of Abstract Expressionism. Like most of Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dots works it is a depiction of mechanical reproduction via painterly technique. In this case, the satire comes from the depiction of the graphical depiction of the spontaneous painting <b>motion</b> <b>in</b> painstaking painterly detail.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{extremely}} bird-like {{anatomy and}} close relationship to other dromaeosaurids, paleontologists hypothesize that Deinonychus was probably covered in feathers. Clear fossil evidence of modern avian-style feathers exists for several related dromaeosaurids, including Velociraptor and Microraptor, though no direct evidence is yet known for Deinonychus itself. When conducting studies of {{such areas as}} the range of <b>motion</b> <b>in</b> the forelimbs, paleontologists like Phil Senter have taken the likely presence of wing feathers (as present in all known dromaeosaurs with skin impressions) into consideration.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and biological processes that have left {{traces of the}} original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with {{a thick layer of}} plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective <b>motion</b> <b>in</b> the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Flanders {{was noted}} for {{introducing}} a 1954 <b>motion</b> <b>in</b> the Senate to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy had made sensational claims {{that there were}} large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside {{the federal government and}} elsewhere. He used his Senate committee as a nationally televised forum for attacks on individuals whom he accused. Flanders felt that McCarthy’s attacks distracted the nation from a much greater threat of Communist successes elsewhere in the world and that they had the effect of creating division and confusion within the United States, to the advantage of its enemies. Ultimately, McCarthy's tactics and his inability to substantiate his claims led to his being discredited and censured by the United States Senate.|$|E

5|$|In 1673, Jeremiah Horrocks {{published}} a reasonably accurate {{model of the}} Moon's <b>motion</b> <b>in</b> which the Moon was assumed to follow a precessing elliptical orbit. A sufficiently accurate and simple method for predicting the Moon's motion would have solved the navigational problem of determining a ship's longitude; in Newton's time, {{the goal was to}} predict the Moon's position to 2' (two arc-minutes), which would correspond to a 1° error in terrestrial longitude. Horrocks' model predicted the lunar position with errors no more than 10 arc-minutes; for comparison, the diameter of the Moon is roughly 30 arc-minutes.|$|E

5|$|It {{is thought}} that the energy {{necessary}} to heat the corona is provided by turbulent <b>motion</b> <b>in</b> the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating. The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone. These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient matter {{in the form of}} heat. The other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events—nanoflares.|$|E
5|$|Neild {{began to}} {{encounter}} difficulties in {{his political career}} {{towards the end of}} the 1880s; his oversight of the establishment of the 1887 Adelaide Jubilee International Exhibition led to investigation by a Legislative Assembly select committee, which absolved him of accusations of extravagance and using his office for personal gain. In 1895 he began to agitate for old-age pensions, but in 1899 he was investigated again after Premier George Reid paid him £350 for writing a report; although Neild repaid the money, the incident was part of the pretext for a successful no confidence <b>motion</b> <b>in</b> September which brought down the Reid government.|$|E
