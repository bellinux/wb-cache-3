This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the Committee, since any dissenters would have to make their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd.|$|E

2500|$|At {{one time}} it was common {{for male and female}} Quakers to have {{separate}} <b>Meetings</b> <b>for</b> Business. This practice was considered to give the women more power and was not meant to demean them. During the 18th century, some Quakers felt that women were not participating fully in <b>Meetings</b> <b>for</b> Business as most women would not [...] "nay-say" [...] their husbands. The solution was to form the two separate <b>Meetings</b> <b>for</b> Business. Many Quaker meeting houses were built with a movable divider down the middle. During <b>Meetings</b> <b>for</b> Worship, the divider was raised. During Business meetings the divider was lowered, creating two rooms. Each gender ran their own separate business meetings. Any issue which required the consent of the whole meetingbuilding repairs for examplewould involve sending an emissary to the other meeting. This practice continued until there was no longer a concern over whether women would [...] "nay-say" [...] their husbands; some very old meetinghouses still have this divider, although it likely is nonmovable.|$|R
