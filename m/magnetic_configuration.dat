Nanowires with the thinnest Co nanodiscs exhibit single domain behavior, while those with thicker Co reverse via vortex states.

Madey used a 43 MeV electron beam and 5 m long wiggler to amplify a signal.|$|E
50|$|The skyrmion <b>magnetic</b> <b>configuration</b> is {{predicted}} to be stable because the atomic spins which are oriented opposite those of the surrounding thin-film cannot ‘flip around’ to align themselves {{with the rest of}} the atoms in the film, without overcoming an energy barrier.

40|$|We {{provide a}} model for the {{prediction}} of the electronic and <b>magnetic</b> <b>configurations</b> of ferromagnetic Fe after an ultrafast decrease or increase of magnetization. The model is based on the well-grounded assumption that, after the ultrafast magnetization change, the system achieves a partial thermal equilibrium. With statistical arguments it is possible to show that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>configurations</b> are qualitatively different in the case of reduced or increased magnetization. The predicted <b>magnetic</b> <b>configurations</b> are then used to compute the dielectric response at the 3 p (M) absorption edge, which can be related to the changes observed in the experimental T-MOKE data. The good qualitative agreement between theory and experiment offers a substantial support to the existence of an ultrafast increase of magnetisation, which has been fiercely debated in the last years.

40|$|The MHD instabilities can {{generate}} complex field topologies {{even if the}} initial field configuration is a very simple one. We consider the stability properties of <b>magnetic</b> <b>configurations</b> containing a toroidal and an axial field. In this paper, we concentrate mainly {{on the behavior of}} non-axisymmetric perturbations in axisymmetric <b>magnetic</b> <b>configurations.</b> The stability is treated by a linear analysis of ideal MHD equations. In the presence of an axial field, it is shown that the instability can occur {{for a wide range of}} the azimuthal wavenumber m, and its growth rate increases with increasing m. At given m, the growth rate is at its maximum for perturbations with the axial wave-vector that makes the Alfvén frequency approximately vanishing. We argue that the instability of <b>magnetic</b> <b>configurations</b> in the ideal MHD can typically be dominated by perturbations with very short azimuthal and axial wavelengths.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} dynamic {{micromagnetics}} is {{to predict the}} time evolution of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>configuration</b> of a sample subject to some non-steady conditions such as {{the application of a}} field pulse or an AC field.

50|$|One {{approach}} to producing fusion power is to confine the plasma with magnetic fields. This {{is most effective}} if the field lines do not penetrate solid surfaces but close on themselves into circles or toroidal surfaces. The mainline confinement concepts of tokamak and stellarator {{do this in a}} toroidal chamber, which allows a great deal of control over the <b>magnetic</b> <b>configuration,</b> but requires a very complex construction. The field-reversed configuration offers an alternative in that the field lines are closed, providing good confinement, but the chamber is cylindrical, allowing simpler, easier construction and maintenance.|$|E
50|$|An electropermanent magnet is {{a special}} {{configuration}} of magnetic materials where the external magnetic field can be turned on and off by applying a current pulse. The EPM {{is based on a}} common <b>magnetic</b> <b>configuration</b> called magnetic latch (right picture). A general example of this configuration assembly is built by a permanent magnet block with two plates of soft magnetic materials (generally iron alloys) {{on each side of the}} block. Those two plates exceed the dimensions of the permanent magnet. Because the plates had a higher permeability than the air, they will concentrate the magnetic flux of the permanent magnet. When a third (external) soft magnet plate is placed touching the other two plates, the magnetic flux will flow confined in the soft magnetic plates creating a closed magnetic circuit and the magnetic field produced by the magnet will be maximum (approximately the magnet remanence).|$|E

(An {{example of such}} a 1st order functional is the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction).In all cases the energy term acts to introduce topologically non-trivial solutions to a system of partial differential equations. In other words, the energy term acts to render possible the existence of a topologically non-trivial <b>magnetic</b> <b>configuration</b> that is confined to a finite, localized region, and possesses an intrinsic stability or meta-stability relative to a trivial homogeneously magnetized ground-state — i.e. a magnetic soliton. An example hamiltonian containing one set of energy terms that allows for the existence of skyrmions of the second category is the following:where the first, second, third and fourth sums correspond to the exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, Zeeman (responsible for the [...] "usual" [...] torques and forces observed on a magnetic dipole moment in a magnetic field), and magnetic Anisotropy (typically magnetocrystalline anisotropy) interaction energies respectively. Note that equation (2) does not contain a term for the dipolar, or 'demagnetizing' interaction between atoms. As in eq. (2), the dipolar interaction is sometimes omitted in simulations of ultra-thin '2 dimensional' magnetic films, because it tends to contribute a minor effect in comparison with the others.|$|E
50|$|A non-trivial {{topology}} {{does not}} in itself imply energetic stability. There is in fact no necessary relation between topology and energetic stability. Hence, one {{must be careful not}} to confuse ‘topological stability,’ which is a mathematical concept, with energy stability in real physical systems. Topological stability refers to the idea that in order for a system described by a continuous field to transition from one topological state to another, a rupture must occur in the continuous field, i.e. a discontinuity must be produced. For example, if one wishes to transform a flexible balloon doughnut (torus) into an ordinary spherical balloon, it is necessary to introduce a rupture on some part of the balloon doughnut's surface. Mathematically, the balloon doughnut would be described as 'topologically stable.' However, in physics, the free energy required to introduce a rupture enabling the transition of a system from one ‘topological’ state to another is always finite. For example, it is possible to turn a rubber ballon into flat piece of rubber by poking it with a needle (and popping it!). Thus, while a physical system can be approximately described using the mathematical concept of topology, attributes such as energetic stability are dependent on the system's parameters—the strength of the rubber in the example above—not the topology per se. In order to draw a meaningful parallel between the concept of topological stability and the energy stability of a system, the analogy must necessarily be accompanied by the introduction of a non-zero phenomenological ‘field rigidity’ to account for the finite energy needed to rupture the field’s topology. Modeling and then integrating this field rigidity can be likened to calculating a breakdown energy-density of the field. These considerations suggest that what {{is often referred to as}} ‘topological protection,’ or a 'topological barrier,' should more accurately be referred to as a 'topology-related energy barrier,' though this terminology is somewhat cumbersome. A quantitative evaluation of such a topological barrier can be obtained by extracting the critical <b>magnetic</b> <b>configuration</b> when the topological number changes during the dynamical process of a skyrmion creation event. Applying the topological charge defined in a lattice, the barrier height is theoretically shown to be proportional to the exchange stiffness.|$|E
