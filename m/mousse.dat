Opened in January 2011, it gained a Michelin star within a year, and in April 2014 was listed fifth on The World's 50 Best Restaurants in Restaurant magazine. It received a second Michelin Star in the 2014 Guide. The restaurant is headed by former Fat Duck head chef Ashley Palmer-Watts. Menu options are based on historical British dishes, which were researched by food historians and through the British Library.

Particular dishes have received praise, including the meat fruit, a chicken liver <b>mousse</b> created {{to look like a}} mandarin orange.|$|E

Dishes that do appear include scallops and peas with cucumber ketchup and bergamot cured mackerel salad. Each item has been based on a historical recipe, such as the scallop dish which dates from 1826 and was published in The Cook and Housewife's Manual Mistress by Meg Dodds. One item which was reported in multiple reviews was the meat fruit, a chicken liver <b>mousse</b> made to look like a textured mandarin orange. The meat fruit was proving so popular that by November 2011, some 900 were being sold per week and the restaurant was aiming to increase production to be able to supply up to 1200 a week.

Nerima serves as a backdrop for more martial arts mayhem with the introduction of Ranma's regular rivals, such as the eternally lost Ryoga Hibiki who traveled halfway across Japan getting from the front of his house to the back, where Ranma spent three days waiting for him. Ryoga, seeking revenge on Ranma, followed him to Jusenkyo where he ultimately falls into the Spring of Drown Piglet. Now when splashed with cold water he {{takes the form of a}} little black pig. Not knowing this, Akane takes the piglet as a pet and names it P-chan, but Ranma knows and hates him for keeping this secret and taking advantage of the situation. Another rival is the nearsighted <b>Mousse,</b> who also falls into a cursed spring and becomes a duck when he gets wet, and finally, there is Ranma's impish grandmaster, Happosai, who spends his time stealing the underwear of schoolgirls.|$|E

500|$|From its inception, {{the kitchen}} was run mainly by French chefs, {{and it had a}} {{specialist}} in Russian soups and Viennese pastry; its cakes became so famous that King Edward made regular orders from Buckingham Palace. M. Malley, who had been saucier at the Paris Ritz [...] was appointed Chef des Cuisines, and invented dishes such as Saumon Marquise de Sevignre (Salmon with a crayfish <b>mousse),</b> Filet de Sole Romanoff (served with mussels, small slices of apple and artichokes), and Poulet en Chaudfroid (chicken accompanied by a curry-flavoured pinkish <b>mousse)</b> at the hotel. The Ritz is renowned for its supreme catering service, as well as using its fine rooms for conferencing between executives and directors of multi-national firms. A table at the restaurant still needs to be booked weeks in advance. The Rivoli Bar, built in the Art Deco style, was designed in 2001 by interior designer Tessa Kennedy, to look like a bar on the Orient Express. The lounge was decorated by Marcel Boulanger in the Louis VIV style, the clubroom was by Lenygon and Morant, who were influenced by the Palladian design of Cumberland House in Brettingham, and other rooms were decorated with clear William Chambers and Robert Adam influences.

The menu was tested over a 12-month period ahead of the launch. Eagle Boys told media it expected a 15% spike in sales {{on the back of the}} launch. A gluten [...] "friendly" [...] base was also on the menu for the first time, with an Eagle Boys spokesperson claiming it was more transparent than claiming it could offer a gluten-free base—only food prepared in a gluten-free kitchen can make the claim that it is truly offering a gluten free range. The chain also announced it would scale back its social media spend.|$|E
500|$|Kitchen Princess won the Kodansha Manga Award for children's manga in 2006. The {{series has}} {{received}} a range of reviews, from positive to lukewarm. Publishers Weekly enjoyed that Najika was not given a magical power and had to keep improving her cooking skills. Although the reviewer for School Library Journal described the series as [...] "a perfectly ordinary romance manga," [...] he praised Nunzio Defilippis and Christina Weir's adaptation of the manga. Deb Aoki of About.com listed the manga {{as one of the}} best shōjo series. Jason Thompson rated the series 3.5 out of 4 stars, describing it as [...] " [...] quick, delightful read." [...] Another reviewer for Publishers Weekly, Johanna Draper Carlsen, wrote that she found the manga reminiscent of the romantic comedy film Simply Irresistible (1999) and that the manga contained conventional shōjo aspects. In a later review of the second volume, she described the series as [...] "entertaining enough, but it’s fluffy and forgettable (like so many of the <b>mousse</b> items and drinks Najika makes). The volumes already feel familiar, even as I’m reading them for the first time." [...] Mania Entertainment's Sakura Eries expressed her lukewarm feelings towards the first volume, writing that the reader's suspension of disbelief was vital to enjoying the manga. She disliked the two-dimensional characterization and Ando's illustrations of the characters, although she felt that the food was well-drawn. Comparing the series to others in the cooking genre, she wrote that it differed in that [...] "cooking is Najika's expression of self and her means of creating relationships and drawing others to common ground (like the estranged Kitazawa Brothers)." [...] In follow-up reviews of the second and third volumes, she remained lukewarm to the series; she praised Kobayashi's portrayal of Akane's eating disorder, though she disliked how Najika's quest to find her flan prince seemed to become more of a side-plot. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network praised Najika as a likeable protagonist and the characterizations as believable. He enjoyed the plot and recipes, although he wrote that the character designs lacked creativity, and criticized the plot clichés and the antagonists' weak characterization. He had mixed feelings about the fourth volume's emphasis on conventional shōjo romance and plot twists at the cost of its cooking aspect. He found the artwork conventional, though able to convey emotion. He wrote that the fifth volume finally balanced the romance and cooking elements, although he disliked the inclusion of a side story, preferring another chapter instead. In his review of the seventh volume, he concluded: [...] "this series takes the hoariest elements of the romance/drama/cooking genres and still manages to come up with something greater than the sum of its parts." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{event that}} {{cemented}} Heston’s {{interest in this}} area was his creation of a crab ice cream to accompany a crab risotto. [...] "People had difficulty accepting Crab Ice Cream, yet if it was renamed [...] "Frozen Crab Bisque", people found it more acceptable and less sweet. [...] p.71 The phenomenon was subsequently researched by Martin Yeomans and Lucy Chambers of the University of Sussex, who served test subjects a version of Blumenthal’s ice cream flavoured with smoked salmon, but told one group they would be tasting ice cream and the other {{that they would be}} tasting a frozen savoury <b>mousse.</b> Although all consumed identical food, those eating what they thought was savoury <b>mousse</b> found the flavour acceptable while those eating what they thought was ice cream found the taste salty and generally disgusting. For Blumenthal, this confirmed his ideas. [...] "If something as simple as a name could make a dish appear more or less salty ... what effect might other cues have on flavours and our appreciation of them?" ...|$|E

Riley's mantra was [...] "no rebounds, no rings", reinforcing the need to fight for rebounds in order to win championships.|$|E
