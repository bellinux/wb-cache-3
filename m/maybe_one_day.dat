2500|$|In {{interviews}} with Charles Rowell and Randall Kenan, Butler credited {{the struggles of}} her working-class mother as an important influence on her writing. Because Butler's mother received little formal education herself, she made sure that young Butler was {{given the opportunity to}} learn by bringing her reading materials that her white employers threw away, from magazines to advanced books. She also encouraged Butler to write. She bought her daughter her first typewriter when she was 10 years old, and, seeing her hard at work on a story, casually remarked that <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> she could become a writer, causing Butler to realize {{that it was possible to}} make a living as an author. A decade later, Mrs. Butler [...] would pay more than a month's rent to have an agent review her daughter's work. She also provided Butler with the money she had been saving for dental work to pay for Butler's scholarship so she could attend the Clarion Science Fiction Writers Workshop, where Butler sold her first two stories.|$|E
5000|$|However due to Top of the Pops being a chart show, {{problems}} could arise - Pearson recalled: “We can often spend {{three or four}} days rehearsing an intricate dance routine to a certain record.

Producer Steve Lillywhite named the song, claiming it sounded like a cross between the sound of Paul McCartney and Radiohead. The song's existence is only known from an image on the 1999 fan calendar with a list of the working titles of the other songs on this album and from an alleged meeting in which Jake Vigliotti claims to have heard said recording. [...] "MacHeadis a song that we were working on for [...] These Crowded Streets and it's a song that we just never got to completion before we finished the album.

60|$|It {{occurred}} to me that this would be an opportunity to make a few notes on the sunrise. The literary man is looked to for occasional description of the sunrise. The earnest reader who has heard about this sunrise thirsts for full particulars. Myself, for purposes of observation, I have generally chosen December or the early part of January. But <b>one</b> never knows. <b>Maybe</b> <b>one</b> of these <b>days</b> I'll want a summer sunrise, with birds and dew-besprinkled flowers: it goes well with the rustic heroine, the miller's daughter, or the girl who brings up chickens and has dreams. I met a brother author once at seven o'clock in the morning in Kensington Gardens. He looked half asleep and so disagreeable that I hesitated for awhile to speak to him: he is a man that as a rule breakfasts at eleven. But I summoned my courage and accosted him.|$|R
2500|$|During a fall movie preview, Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} Malkovich [...] "easily racks {{up the most}} laughs" [...] among the cast as the foul-mouthed and short-tempered ex-CIA man. The first scene Malkovich {{performed}} was a phone call in which he shouts several obscenities at Pitt and McDormand. But Malkovich could {{not be on the}} sound stage for the call because he was rehearsing a play, so he called in the lines from his apartment in Paris. Regarding the scene, Malkovich said, [...] "It was really late at night and I was screaming {{at the top of my}} lungs. God knows what the neighbors thought." [...] Swinton plays Malkovich's wife who engages in an affair with Clooney, although the two characters do not get along well. Clooney's and Swinton's characters also had a poor relationship in their previous film together, Michael Clayton, prompting Clooney to say to Swinton at the end of a shoot, [...] "Well, <b>maybe</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> we'll get to make a film together when we say one nice thing to each other." [...] Swinton said of the dynamic, [...] "I'm very happy to shout at him on screen. It's great fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of The Real Thing, Faith No More {{developed}} somewhat of a rivalry with fellow Californian funk rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, whom they had previously played with on The Uplift Mofo Party Tour. Singer Anthony Kiedis accused Mike Patton of stealing his [...] "style" [...] in the [...] "Epic" [...] music video. He told Kerrang! magazine [...] "My drummer says he’s gonna kidnap , shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet, just so he’ll be forced to find a style of his own". In a separate interview, he clarified his comment, remarking [...] "I love The Real Thing, and I liked his vocals on that record. I mean, when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, but when I saw that video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?.'" [...] Roddy Bottum responded by saying [...] "To me, our band sounds nothing like Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you're talking about long hair, rapping with his shirt off, then yeah, I can see similarities. But beyond that, I can't see any. I haven't talked to them since this whole thing started. We're really good friends with that band and i'd like to think they're doing it... like as a favour". Mike Patton finally addressed the allegations from Kiedis in 1990, commenting that [...] "It just kind of {{came out of the}} blue. It doesn't bother me a bit. I got a real big kick out of it to tell you the truth. I mean, if he's gonna talk about me in interviews, that's fine - it's free press! Either he's feeling inadequate or old or I don't know, but I have no reason to talk shit about him." [...] Later in 2001, Patton also theorized that [...] "I think Anthony, deep down, feels like I'm a better dancer than he is. I think I shake my booty just a little bit fresher than he does. And if he would stop doing drugs I think he could outdance me. <b>Maybe</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> we'll have a breakoff, just breakdance." ...|$|E

5000|$|Around 2002, Sköld {{recorded}} a follow {{up to his}} 1996 self-titled album. These songs have never been officially released. Sköld stated {{in an interview with}} The Sychophant that he had made a demo with 10 copies ever made. The demo had 10 songs on it. Six of the 10 were released on file sharing networks without Sköld's permission: [...] "Burn", [...] "Dead God", [...] "I Hate", [...] "Believe", [...] "The Point", and [...] "Don't Pray". The demo is known as the Dead God EP, although Sköld says that it was called Disrupting the Orderly Routine of the Institution. The original artwork was made with an inkjet printer and was the title written in drippy letters. This demo was given to several friends that Sköld considered trustworthy, but his songs appeared on the internet from one of them.

A Merry Christmas {{to all of}} you at Bryant College. Yes, I {{received}} the package containing two boxes of delicious chocolate covered cherries.

For quite some time I have hoped to be home at a time when Bryant was open, but all my short visits to Pawtucket have been on a Sunday, and since it is necessary to be back in camp by Monday morning at 0600 to call formation, it just is impossible to drop in. <b>Maybe</b> <b>one</b> of these <b>days</b> I shall take a much needed furlough and drop in to visit with all my former teachers, and you of the Service Club.
