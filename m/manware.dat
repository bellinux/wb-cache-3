5000|$|Manwaring's brother, John H. <b>Manwaring,</b> and his son, George Ernest <b>Manwaring,</b> wrote a {{delightful}} biography of George. George <b>Manwaring</b> {{had only a}} few weeks of formal schooling and no formal music training, but was noted for his talent. As a youth in Cheshire, England, he had worked as an errand boy in the country store, and would take advantage of every opportunity to read good books, borrowing books from his employer and others. He became very much interested in the study of stenography, mathematics and literature, and when he arrived in Utah would use his stenographic ability to report sermons delivered in the Mormon Tabernacle. <b>Manwaring</b> was able to play piano and organ, and taught these as well. He was just 24 years old when he wrote the text and composed the tune for the famous LDS hymn, [...] "Oh How Lovely Was the Morning." [...] At {{the time he was a}} husband with two little children and a third on the way. [...] "Oh How Lovely Was the Morning" [...] recounts the vision of the boy, Joseph Smith. <b>Manwaring</b> was on a sales trips for the D. O. Calder Music Palace when artist C.C.A. Christiansen took him into his studio and showed <b>Manwaring</b> a painting he had just finished. The painting was titled The Vision, and depicted the Father and Son appearing to Joseph Smith in the sacred grove in answer to prayer. During his lifetime, George would write over a hundred poems and hymns.|$|R

50|$|As {{the spring}} of 1930 approached, <b>Manwaring</b> {{received}} a letter from the chairman of the Ricks Board of Education. President Romney had been granted a leave of absence and they wanted <b>Manwaring</b> to fill the position of Acting President. Hyrum received the impression that the assignment could lead to his elevation to be President. Although he felt an obligation because he was on leave from Ricks, <b>Manwaring</b> agonized over the decision. His studies were going well, the family had settled in to enjoy their new home and (most importantly) he was not at all sure the college would even survive. But he finally said “yes” anyway.|$|R
