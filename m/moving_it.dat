5|$|The similar Dardanelles Guns (for the location) {{were created}} by Munir Ali in 1464 and were still in use during the Anglo-Turkish War (1807–09). These were cast in bronze into two parts, the chase (the barrel) and the breech, which {{combined}} weighed 18.4tonnes. The two parts were screwed together using levers to facilitate <b>moving</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around 300men from Cheadle Hulme {{served in}} the First World War, and {{it was decided that}} those who died should be commemorated. Various ideas, {{including}} a library and clock tower, were suggested and in the end a cenotaph was built on the corner of Ravenoak Road and Manor Road in 1921. Additions for later wars have been made, and due to the busy traffic around that particular place there have been suggestions for <b>moving</b> <b>it</b> to a quieter area.|$|E
5|$|Authorities of Belize City {{considered}} {{abandoning the}} community and <b>moving</b> <b>it</b> to higher ground. Additionally, there was a proposal to relocate the capital further south or inland to the pine ridge, with either resulting in a higher elevation of the capital. However, the process of moving the capital did not begin until 1961, after Belize City was devastated by Hurricane Hattie. Belmopan became {{the capital city of}} British Honduras in 1970.|$|E

5|$|In 1473 the Gujarat Sultan Mahmud Begada sacked {{the city}} and {{destroyed}} the temple of Dwarka. The Jagat Mandir or the Dwarakadhisa temple was later rebuilt. Vallabha Acharya retrieved an idol of Dwarkadhish, which was revered by Rukmini. He hid it in a stepwell, known as Savitri vav, during the Muslim invasion, before <b>moving</b> <b>it</b> to Ladva village. In 1551, when Turk Aziz invaded Dwarka, the idol was shifted to the island of Bet Dwarka.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, McMullen {{sold the}} team to Puck Holdings, an {{affiliate}} of YankeeNets, for $176million. The owners wanted to program Devils games on what eventually became the YES Network and move {{the team to}} a new arena in Newark. Neither of these proposals became reality under Puck Holdings' ownership. For {{the start of the}} next season, Lamoriello was appointed CEO of both the Devils and the New Jersey Nets National Basketball Association team. He remained {{at the helm of the}} basketball team until it was sold with the intention of <b>moving</b> <b>it</b> to Brooklyn in 2004.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the MTA filed {{to change}} the {{location}} of Entrance 1, <b>moving</b> <b>it</b> onto from the sidewalk, away from its original proposed location inside 301 East 69th Street. This was because designs for entrances inside the building failed to both satisfy the building's residents as well as meet the MTA's engineering requirements. With the New York City Department of Transportation planning a bike lane along {{the east side of}} Second Avenue after construction is finished, the MTA could widen the sidewalk {{to make room for the}} entrances without ultimately disrupting traffic flow.|$|E
50|$|Many years later, budding physics student Dean Hollister and his discredited physics teacher {{have become}} obsessed with the same mystery.

Officials told The Washington Post that the project would move into the final design stage. The FTA approved funding for the project on December 4, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Pong is a {{two-dimensional}} sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by <b>moving</b> <b>it</b> vertically across {{the left or}} right side of the screen. They can compete against either a computer-controlled opponent or another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.|$|E
5|$|The case is {{particularly}} notable {{as an example}} of judicial legislation, with the judges significantly modernising the law and <b>moving</b> <b>it</b> forward in a way Parliament had not considered. As a side impact, Coke's arguments were the first to define consideration. The conservative outlook of the Common Pleas soon changed; after the death of Edmund Anderson, the more activist Francis Gawdy became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and other Common Pleas judges, many of whom were uncertain but had followed Anderson's lead in the case, changed their mind.|$|E

5|$|A poorly {{organized}} tropical wave {{moved into}} the eastern Pacific on August29 and quickly developed into a tropical depression by 0600UTC the following day. Within an environment of low wind shear, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, acquiring the name Henriette, at 1200UTC on August31. Moving west-northwest around a ridge positioned over inland Mexico, the center passed narrowly offshore after producing squally weather along the coastline. The system moved westward while continuing to intensify, becoming a Category1 hurricane at 0600UTC on September4 and subsequently attaining its peak intensity with winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 972mb (hPa; 28.71inHg) six hours later. An approaching upper-level trough caused Henriette to turn northwest later that day, <b>moving</b> <b>it</b> ashore near San Jose del Cabo, Mexico at 2100UTC as a minimal hurricane. After crossing Baja California Sur, Henriette weakened to a tropical storm and made a second landfall near Guaymas, Mexico. The system moved inland and quickly weakened, dissipating by 1200UTC on September6.|$|E
5|$|Another man {{is found}} dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his {{apartment}}. Evidence {{in his apartment}} points {{to the construction of}} a bomb, and the Fringe team suspects that Dana knows its location and may be hoping to exploit an event which will kill several people simultaneously in order to increase her own chances of death. Peter calls her, using caller ID spoofing to disguise his number as that of her late husband, and the signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a commuter train. The train is stopped and searched, while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, <b>moving</b> <b>it</b> far enough away from the train. The bomb soon explodes, and when Peter and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally dead, and the only fatality from the explosion.|$|E
5|$|NY414 {{has been}} {{truncated}} twice over the years. The {{first of these}} occurred on January1, 1949, when it was cut back on its southern end to Corning. NY414 was truncated to its current northern terminus in the mid-1960s following {{the construction of the}} super two highway for US104 between Sodus and NY414. US104 continued to use the former alignment of NY414 along Lake Bluff Road to connect to Ridge Road until the remainder of the super two east to Red Creek was completed in the early 1970s. This portion of Lake Bluff Road is now maintained by Wayne County as CR254. In Seneca County, NY414 was realigned slightly in the early 1950s to bypass the hamlet of Romulus to the east, <b>moving</b> <b>it</b> off CR148 and NY96 and onto a new road leading directly to Ovid.|$|E

5|$|Police {{arrived at}} the embassy almost {{immediately}} after the first reports of gunfire, and, within ten minutes, seven DPG officers were on the scene. The officers moved to surround the embassy, but retreated when a gunman appeared at a window and threatened to open fire. Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Dellow arrived nearly 30 minutes later and took command of the operation. Dellow established a temporary headquarters in his car before <b>moving</b> <b>it</b> to the Royal School of Needlework further down Princes Gate and then to 24 Princes Gate, a nursery school. From his various command posts, Dellow coordinated the police response, including the deployment of D11, the Metropolitan Police's marksmen, and officers with specialist surveillance equipment. Police negotiators made contact with Oan via a field telephone passed {{through one of the}} embassy windows, and were assisted by a negotiator and a psychiatrist. At 15:15 Oan issued the DRFLA's first demand, the release of 91 Arabs held in prisons in Khūzestān, and threatened to blow up the embassy and the hostages if this were not done by noon on 1 May.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders is a {{two-dimensional}} fixed shooter {{game in which}} the player controls a laser cannon by <b>moving</b> <b>it</b> horizontally {{across the bottom of}} the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens—some versions feature different numbers—that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance toward {{the bottom of the screen}}. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating the aliens brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue without end.|$|E
5|$|The FA Charity Shield {{was founded}} in 1908 as a {{successor}} to the Sheriff of London Charity Shield, and began as a contest between the respective champions of the Football League and Southern League, although in 1913 it was played between an Amateurs XI and a Professionals XI. In 1921, it was played by the league champions of the Football League First Division and the FA Cup winners for the first time. The 1974 match was the first Charity Shield game to be played at Wembley Stadium as the Football Association (the FA) tried to revive {{the status of the}} match as a traditional season curtain-raiser by <b>moving</b> <b>it</b> to the country's showpiece venue. Furthermore, it was televised live {{for the first time ever}} and the FA insisted on the champions and cup winners both taking part for the first time since 1970.|$|E
