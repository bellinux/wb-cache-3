50|$|The IBM 728 <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> {{was used}} on the SAGE AN/FSQ-7 computer. It was {{physically}} similar to the IBM 727, but with significantly different specifications.|$|E
50|$|A {{tape head}} cleaner is a {{substance}} used for cleaning the record/playback heads of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> (such as {{in a video}} tape machine, or audio tape machine).|$|E
50|$|Tape Programming Support (TPS) {{supports}} {{systems with}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drives</b> but no disk drives.The minimum configuration for TPS is 4096 bytes of main storage, a card reader, a card punch, a printer and two <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> drives.On such systems TPS provides an assembler and tape manipulation utility programs.Additional capabilities are provided on systems with 8192 bytes of main storage,and still more with {{four or more}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|R

50|$|The LINCtape <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drive,</b> {{designed}} by Wesley A. Clark for the LINC, was suitable for handling {{in a laboratory}} environment, and the tapes could be carelessly pocketed, dropped, or even pierced and cut without losing the data stored on them.|$|E
5000|$|... 1952: Magnetic tape vacuum columnIBM {{introduces}} the <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> vacuum column, {{making it possible}} for fragile magnetic tape to become a viable data storage medium. The use of the vacuum column in the IBM 701 system signals the beginning of the era of magnetic storage, as the technology becomes widely adopted throughout the industry.|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drive,</b> the Univac Uniservo, {{recorded}} at {{the density of}} 128 bit/in on a half-inch magnetic tape, resulting in the areal density of 256 bit/in2. [...] In 2015, IBM and Fujifilm claimed a new record for the magnetic tape areal density of 1.23 Gbit/in2, while LTO-6, the highest-density production tape shipping in 2015, provides an areal density of 0.84 Gbit/in2.|$|E
50|$|Like <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drives,</b> {{floppy disk}} drives have {{physical}} {{limits on the}} spacing of flux reversals (also called transitions, represented by one-bits).|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{concerns the}} proposal to extend an existing contract {{for the maintenance of}} automated <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drives</b> and libraries for experiment data. For the reasons explained in this document, the Finance Committee is invited to approve the extension of a maintenance and license contract with STORAGETEK (CH) for existing high-performance <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drives</b> and libraries for experiment data for a total amount of up to 1 650 000 Swiss francs for a period of three years starting January 2005...|$|R
5000|$|The devices used {{a special}} {{incremental}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> that {{was controlled by}} the STR communications unit. The drive used standard one half inch, seven track magnetic tape reels recorded at 200 bytes per inch (BPI). It moved the tape on demand in increments of [...]005 in and was capable of reading data under the read/write head even when the tape was stationary. Either binary or BCD tapes could be processed.|$|E
50|$|In most {{operating}} systems predating Unix, programs had to explicitly {{connect to the}} appropriate input and output devices. OS-specific intricacies caused {{this to be a}} tedious programming task. On many systems it was necessary to obtain control of environment settings, access a local file table, determine the intended data set, and handle hardware correctly in the case of punch card reader, <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drive,</b> disk drive, line printer, card punch, or interactive terminal.|$|E
5000|$|Jerome [...] "Jerry" [...] Hal Lemelson (July 18, 1923 - October 1, 1997) was an American engineer, inventor, and patent holder. Several of his inventions {{and works}} in the fields in which he {{patented}} have made possible, either wholly or in part, innovations like automated warehouses, industrial robots, cordless telephones, fax machines, videocassette recorders, camcorders, and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> used in Sony's Walkman tape players. Lemelson's 605 patents {{made him one of}} the most prolific inventors in American history.|$|E

50|$|Nowadays, other {{technologies}} can perform {{the functions of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape.</b> In many cases, these technologies are replacing tape. Despite this, innovation in the technology continues, and Sony and IBM continue to produce new <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|R
50|$|While the H200 {{supported}} {{operation with}} just a console, card reader and punch like the IBM 1401, the generic Input-Output instructions also supported line printers and <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|R
50|$|From 1957 on, {{he worked}} {{exclusively}} {{as an independent}} inventor. From this period onwards, Lemelson received an average of one patent a month for more than 40 years, in technological fields related to automated warehouses, industrial robots, a talking thermometer (for the blind), cordless telephones, computer controlled spraying robots, fax machines, videocassette recorders, heat-sealing machine, illuminated highway makers, patient monitoring systems, camcorders, and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> used in Sony's Walkman tape players. As an independent inventor, Lemelson wrote, sketched, and filed almost all of his patent applications himself, with little help from outside counsel.|$|E
50|$|In a {{completed}} and working <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> system, the tape-drive heads apply {{a very specific}} magnetic field to the tape; the tape then induces a change in electric current, which is captured. The data from the Lunar Orbiter tapes is then run through a demodulator, and through an analog-to-digital converter {{so that it can}} be fed into a computer for digital processing. Each image is divided up into strips on the tape, so the computer is used to bring the strips together to create a whole image. Before even beginning the project, the team evaluated the risks and determined that there were two: one was that the tapes had deteriorated to the point where they could not be read; the second was that the tape drives would not be able to read the tapes. The milestones of the project were developed to test these risks as soon as possible with the least amount of money spent.|$|E
5000|$|The Smithsonian Institution owns a Model 65, {{though it}} is no longer on public display. The Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA has a {{non-working}} Model 30 on display, as do the Museum of Transport and Technology (Motat) in Auckland, New Zealand and the Vienna University of Technology in Austria. The University of Western Australia Computer Club has a complete Model 40 in storage. The IBM museum in Sindelfingen has two System/360s [...] - [...] a Model 20 and a Model 91.

5000|$|The Datapoint 2200 had a {{built-in}} full-travel keyboard, {{a built-in}} 12-line, 80-column green screen monitor, and two 47 character-per-inch cassette tape drives each with 130 kB capacity. Its size, 9+5/8 x 18+1/2 x 19+5/8 in, and shape - {{a box with}} protruding keyboard - approximated that of an IBM Selectric typewriter. Initially, a Diablo 2.5 MB 2315-type removable cartridge hard disk drive was available, along with modems, several types of serial interface, parallel interface, printers and a punched card reader. Later, an 8-inch floppy disk drive was also made available, along with other, larger hard disk drives. An industry-compatible 7/9-track (user selectable) <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> was available by 1975. In late 1977, Datapoint introduced ARCnet local area networking. The original Type 1 2200 shipped with 2 kilobytes of serial shift register main memory, expandable to 8K. The Type 2 2200 used denser 1 kbit RAM chips, giving it a default 4K of memory, expandable to 16K. Its starting price was around US $5,000 (...) , and a full 16K Type 2 2200 had a list price of just over $14,000.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 33) This report {{covers the}} design and development of a diagnostic test system for a streaming magnetic tape machine manufactured by Pertec Computer company. The streaming magnetic tape machine represents {{a new approach to}} recording in the field of tape storage. As the name implies, it was designed to accept a continuous stream of data instead of the conventional short bursts. The report outlines {{the design and}} development of a test system in three consecutive phases. 'Bottom up' design programming technique was incorporated in all three phases. 'Bottom up' design is an evolutionary process which initially encompasses primitive elements including initial specifications, basic program definitions and minimal hardware. As the system design progresses the primitive elements expand with the integration of further primitives to evolve into a final sophisticated system. The project includes writing the functional specifications and designing the test system software package. Associated tasks include the determination of the host computer requirements and the design of a high speed input/output driver {{as an integral part of}} the test system. This test system, as of September 1983, has been used successfully on the streaming <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>drive</b> production line at Pertec...|$|E
