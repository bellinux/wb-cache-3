2500|$|The offset is {{the index}} of the first term given. For some {{sequence}}s, the offset is obvious. For example, if we list the sequence of square numbers as 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ..., the offset is 0; while if we list it as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ..., the offset is 1. The default offset is 0, and most sequences in the OEIS have offset of either 0 or 1. Sequence , the <b>magic</b> <b>constant</b> for n×n magic square with prime entries (regarding 1 as a prime) with smallest row sums, {{is an example of}} a sequence with offset 3, and , [...] "Number of stars of visual magnitude n." [...] {{is an example of a}} sequence with offset -1. Sometimes there can be disagreement over what the initial terms of the sequence are, and correspondingly what the offset should be. In the case of the lazy caterer's sequence, the maximum number of pieces you can cut a pancake into with n cuts, the OEIS gives the sequence as 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, ... with offset 0, while Mathworld gives the sequence as 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, ... (implied offset 1). It can be argued that making no cuts to the pancake is technically a number of cuts, namely n = 0. But it can also be argued that an uncut pancake is irrelevant to the problem. Although the offset is a required field, some contributors don't bother to check if the default offset of 0 is appropriate to the sequence they are sending in. The internal format actually shows two numbers for the offset. The first is the number described above, while the second represents {{the index of}} the first entry (counting from 1) that has an absolute value greater than 1. This second value is used to speed up the process of searching for a sequence. Thus , which starts 1, 1, 1, 2 with the first entry representing a(1) has 1, 4 as the internal value of the offset field.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{technique}} {{developed by}} Tomba (July 2012) for finding (n x n) magic squares (when n is divisible by 4) using basic Latin squares is re-discussed. The steps include fixing the column {{associated with the}} elements, adjacent to the pivot element and arranging in an orderly manner, making symmetric transformations that generates a <b>magic</b> parametric <b>constant</b> (T) and finally derived with minor adjustment on the pair-numbers of satisfying T [12]. Nordgren’s method can be applied {{so as to avoid}} symmetric transformation, adjustment on the pair numbers satisfying T and thereby shortening in 3 steps only. The improved technique for construction of doublyeven magic squares needs three steps with no symmetric transformation, minor adjustments etc. on the pair numbers satisfying T. As such, lot of labour and time is saved with the use of this improved technique.

40|$|Abstract: Tomba (2012) {{introduced}} a technique for construction (n x n) magic squares (when n is odd) using basic Lat in Squares by fixing the pivot element and arranging other elements {{in an orderly}} manner [10]. However, even-order magic squares can’t be constructed using the same procedure because of duplication in diagonal elements. In this paper, a technique for constructing (n x n) magic squares (when n is doubly even) using basic Latin square is developed. Doubly even magic squares are made by fixing the column associated with the elements, adjacent to the pivot element and arranging {{in an orderly manner}} that generates a <b>magic</b> parametric <b>constant</b> (T, known as Tomba’s constant) and sub-magic parametric constants (Ti) and finally derived by minor adjustment on the values of Ti s. The technique can provide weak magic squares for singly even cases. The construction is illustrated with suitable examples.

40|$|We {{define a}} {{counting}} function that {{is related to}} the binomial coefficients. An explicit formula for this function is proved. In some particular cases, simpler explicit formuls are derived. We also derive a formula for the number of (0, 1) -matrices, having a fixed number of 1 's, and having no zero rows and zero columns. Further, we show that our function satisfies several recurrence relations. The relationship of our counting function with different classes of integers is then examined. These classes include: different kind of figurate numbers, the number of points on the surface of a square pyramid, the <b>magic</b> <b>constants,</b> the truncated square numbers, the coefficients of the Chebyshev polynomials, the Catalan numbers, the Dellanoy numbers, the Sulanke numbers, the numbers of the coordination sequences, and the number of the crystal ball sequences of a cubic lattice. In {{the last part of the}} paper, we prove that several configurations are counted by our function. Some of these are: the number of spanning subgraphs of the complete bipartite graph, the number of square containing in a square, the number of coloring's of points on a line, the number of divisors of some particular numbers, the number of all parts in the compositions of an integer, the numbers of the weak compositions of integers, and the number of particular lattice paths. We conclude by counting the number of possible moves of the rook, bishop, and queen on a chessboard. The most statements in the paper are provided by bijective proofs in terms of insets, which are defined in the paper. With this we want to show that different configurations may be counted by the same method...|$|R

50|$|It is {{generally}} not safe to assume the size of any datatype. For example, even though most implementations of C and C++ on 32-bit systems define type int to be four octets, this size may change when code is ported to a different system, breaking the code. The exception to this is the data type char, which always has the size 1 in any standards-compliant C implementation. In addition, it is frequently difficult to predict the sizes of compound datatypes such as a struct or union, due to padding.
