However, Bowaters UK offered the main line, some of the locos and rolling stock of the railway to the Locomotive Club of Great Britain for preservation as a tourist railway. Other locomotives and rolling stock were sold to the Great Whipsnade Railway and the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway. The SKLR is now the longest continuous operator of the railway.|$|E
25|$|Lawson Billinton, the District Locomotive Superintendent at New Cross depot {{had sought}} to {{alleviate}} the situation by executing repairs and boiler changes, but this had little impact on the problem. The LB Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Superintendent D.E. Marsh received {{much of the blame}} for the problem, which had been developing for some years, and he was granted leave of absence due to sickness in 1910, followed by his resignation in July 1911. Billinton had been invited to take over on a temporary basis during Marsh's sickness, and promptly set about re-organising the works and reducing the backlog by using emerging Time and <b>motion</b> <b>study</b> techniques.|$|E
25|$|Productivity is a {{standard}} efficiency metric for evaluation of production systems, broadly speaking a ratio between outputs and inputs, and can assume many specific forms, for example: machine productivity, workforce productivity, raw material productivity, warehouse productivity (=inventory turnover). It is also useful to break up productivity in use U (productive percentage of total time) and yield η (ratio between produced volume and productive time) to better evaluate production systems performances. Cycle times can be modeled through manufacturing engineering if the individual operations are heavily automated, if the manual component is the prevalent one, methods used include: time and <b>motion</b> <b>study,</b> predetermined motion time systems and work sampling.|$|E

As of April 1, 2009, The USBC now regulates the chemical surface roughness of all bowling balls manufactured for certified ten-pin bowling. This specification is a direct result from the ball <b>motion</b> <b>study,</b> as the surface roughness of the coverstock of a bowling ball was the number one variable (out of 18) that affected the strength (how much a ball hooks) of a bowling ball. The radius of gyration specification has also been tightened and went into effect in 2010.

25|$|Flourishing in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, {{scientific}} management built on earlier pursuits of economic efficiency. While it was prefigured in the folk wisdom of , it favored empirical methods to determine efficient procedures rather than perpetuating established traditions. Thus {{it was followed by}} a profusion of successors in applied science, including time and <b>motion</b> <b>study,</b> the Efficiency Movement (which was a broader cultural echo of scientific management's impact on business managers specifically), Fordism, operations management, operations research, industrial engineering, management science, manufacturing engineering, logistics, business process management, business process reengineering, lean manufacturing, and Six Sigma. There is a fluid continuum linking scientific management with the later fields, and the different approaches often display a high degree of compatibility.|$|E

2500|$|Taylor is also {{credited}} {{for developing}} stopwatch time study, this combined with Frank and Lillian Gilbreth <b>motion</b> <b>study</b> {{gave way to}} time and <b>motion</b> <b>study</b> which is centered on the concepts of standard method and standard time. Frank Gilbreth is also responsible for introducing the flow process chart in 1921. Other contemporaries of Taylor worth remembering are Morris Cooke (rural electrification in the 1920s and implementer of Taylor's principles of scientific management in the Philadelphia's Department of Public Works), Carl Barth (speed-and-feed-calculating slide rules [...] ) and Henry Gantt (Gantt chart). Also in 1910 Hugo Diemer published the first industrial engineering book: Factory Organization and Administration.|$|E
2500|$|In {{conducting}} their <b>Motion</b> <b>Study</b> {{method to}} work, {{they found that}} the key to improving work efficiency was in reducing unnecessary motions. [...] Not only were some motions unnecessary, but they caused employee fatigue. [...] Their efforts to reduce fatigue included reduced motions, tool redesign, parts placement, and bench and seating height, for which they began to develop workplace standards. The Gilbreths' work broke ground for contemporary understanding of ergonomics.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{thought that}} by {{analyzing}} work, the [...] "one best way" [...] {{to do it}} would be found. He is most remembered for developing the stopwatch time study, which combined with Frank Gilbreth's <b>motion</b> <b>study</b> methods, later became the field of time and <b>motion</b> <b>study.</b> He broke a job into its component parts and measured each to the hundredth of a minute. One of his most famous studies involved shovels. He noticed that workers used the same shovel for all materials. He determined that the most effective load was 21½ lb, and found or designed shovels that for each material would scoop up that amount. He was generally unsuccessful in getting his concepts applied, and was dismissed from Bethlehem Iron Company/Bethlehem Steel Company. Nevertheless, Taylor was able to convince workers who used shovels and whose compensation was tied to how much they produced to adopt his advice about the optimum way to shovel by breaking the movements down into their component elements and recommending better ways to perform these movements. It was largely {{through the efforts of}} his disciples (most notably H.L. Gantt) that industry came to implement his ideas. Moreover, the book he wrote after parting company with the Bethlehem company, Shop Management, sold well.|$|E

Four crossings would have been [...] "severely" [...] affected, with barrier downtimes increasing by between 25% and 36%. As no independent time and <b>motion</b> <b>study</b> had been conducted, the closure times of level crossings and impact to the surrounding area had yet to be assessed at the time of the project's cancellation.|$|E
