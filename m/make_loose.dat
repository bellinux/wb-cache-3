6000|$|Dryden {{might have}} profited by an admirable saying of his own, that [...] "they who would combat general {{authority}} with particular opinion must first establish themselves {{a reputation of}} understanding better than other men." [...] He understood the defects {{much better than the}} beauties of the French theatre. Lessing was even more one-sided in his judgment upon it.[59] Goethe, with his usual wisdom, studied it carefully without losing his temper, and tried to profit by its structural merits. Dryden, with his eyes wide open, copied its worst faults, especially its declamatory sentiment. He should have known that certain things can never be transplanted, and that among these is a style of poetry whose great excellence was that it was in perfect sympathy with the genius of the people among whom it came into being. But the truth is, that Dryden had no aptitude whatever for the stage, and in writing for it he was attempting to make a trade of his genius,--an arrangement from which the genius always withdraws in disgust. It was easier to <b>make</b> <b>loose</b> thinking and the bad writing which betrays it pass unobserved while the ear was occupied with the sonorous music of the rhyme to which they marched. Except in [...] "All for Love," [...] "the only play," [...] he tells us, [...] "which he wrote to please himself,"[60] there is no trace of real passion in any of his tragedies. This, indeed, is inevitable, for there are no characters, but only personages, in any except that. That is, in many respects, a noble play, and there are few finer scenes, whether in the conception or the carrying out, than that between Antony and Ventidius in the first act.[61] ...|$|E

50|$|Most {{commonly}} found in the United States Navy, the doctrine evolved in the 1980s, although a variant known as Auftragstaktik {{was used by the}} German armed forces in the Second World War. Traditionally, naval engagements had been conducted in the same way for 400 years: the task force commander would coordinate centrally. Improved technology led to warfare moving faster, which necessitated a shift away from central control; a commander {{had to be able to}} focus on the wider picture, and would not be able to effectively do that if they were also dictating the actions of every individual subordinate. Command by negation first came into being on individual ships, where it made sense - a captain who delegated authority and exercised command by negation could easily monitor his staff and communicate with them because it was a small environment. Within wider naval engagements, however, the Officer in Tactical Command (OTC) still maintained a rigid control structure, because communications systems simply couldn't work efficiently enough to <b>make</b> <b>loose</b> and autonomous doctrines viable.|$|E

The pressing and component <b>make</b> <b>loose</b> contact; the cavity volume exceeds that of the pressing. The component is deformed such that the component and pressing undergo interlocking and/or frictional bonding. The pressing is foamed by supplying heat externally. In an otherwise similar process, the foamed pressing includes the cavity into which the component is introduced. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The deformation is caused by extrusion. Heat treatment follows immediately, to induce foaming. In a further variant of the process, a foamable powder is used {{in place of the}} foamable pressing. The component is a thermal conductor, through which heat is supplied to the foamable material. A first layer of foamable material used to make the composite, has a lower liquidus temperature than a second layer. The first layer largely comprises compacted aluminum powder. The second is aluminum or aluminum alloy. AN INDEPENDENT CLAIM IS INCLUDED FOR an intermediate product so produced. USE - To make a composite intermediate product, comprising a component bonded to a foamed body, for e. g. reinforcement. ADVANTAGE - Premature melting of the component is prevented in this process. Costly, slow operations such as adhesion are avoided. Defined quantities of material are used to produce a composite with maximum contact area between foam and the component. Heat transfer between the component and the pressing are improved and prior melting of the component during foaming is avoided. The foamable material used can be in solid- or powder form.

40|$|Electric cell-substrate {{impedance}} sensing (ECIS) {{pioneered by}} Giaever and Keese {{is suitable for}} continuous, automatic and real-time cell attachment analysis. ECIS is a novel electrical method to study, in real time, many of the activities of animal cells when grown in tissue culture. These include morphological changes, cell locomotion, and other behaviors directed by the cell 2 ̆ 7 s cytoskeleton. One of the most direct ECIS measurements {{is that of the}} attachment and spreading behaviors of cells. These measurements allow one to study and quantify the interaction of cultured cells with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and other macromolecules continuously and in real time. Traditionally, cell attachment and spreading measurements are labor intensive, requiring many manipulations of the cultures for microscopic evaluation of cell behavior. With ECIS, these same measurements can be made in an automated approach without opening the door of the incubator. The ECIS core technology is based on a technique of measuring the change in impedance of a small electrode to AC current flow. The heart of the measurement is a specialized slide that has 8 individual wells for cell culturing. The base of the device has an array of gold film electrodes that connect to the ECIS electronics to each of the 8 wells. In our work we used ECIS to study the attachment and spread of HUVEC and 3 T 3 cells. The curve of HUVEC showed higher resistances than that of 3 T 3 cells. This was due to the fact we used gelatin to aid in attachment of HUVECs which accounted for the high resistances. 3 T 3 cells attached easily without help of gelatin. We also studied the cytotoxicity of HUVEC and 3 T 3 cells. The drugs that we used were CB, H 7 and CdCl 2. We found that the best drug was CB since it affected the cells even at low concentrations. H 7 effects were mild while CdCl 2 only worked at high concentrations. HUVEC cells <b>make</b> <b>loose</b> contact on electrodes and are easily detached by drugs. 3 T 3 makes firm at tachment to the electrodes and are not easily detached from the electrodes. Electrical impedance measurements on multiple electrodes are highly attractive in this application because of the potential for direct computer control...|$|E

40|$|This entire {{research}} work is focused {{for the performance}} evaluation of an Innovative tea dryer using a technique of mathematical modeling. The innovative tea dryer was designed and fabricated targeting the group of farmers who cultivate bio tea /organic tea in few acres amidst of lot of constraints. Main challenge {{for the production of}} tea at small scale is consistent drying. Since drying is a key factor affecting the quality of the ultimate product of tea, the simulation results of the mathematical model explain the drying performance and how the physical model or the prototype could be scaled. The tea sector has always been a vital component of Sri Lanka’s economy. Sri Lanka as the third biggest tea producing country globally, has a production share of 9 % in the international sphere, and one of the world's leading exporters with a share of around 19 % of the global demand. The total extent of land under tea cultivation has been assessed at approximately 187, 309 hectares. Much of the growth boost in low grown tea production is attributed to the rise of the tea smallholders who are concentrated in the low-country. It is estimated that the smallholders occupy about 65 to 70 % of the tea extent in the country and their contribution to overall production has also now risen to around 65 to 70 %. Since the organic tea has an increasing demand and a good overseas market the tea cultivators of small holders are encouraged to produce organic tea. In the traditional or 'orthodox' procedure, the process used to <b>make</b> <b>loose</b> tea, the leaves must go through a process of Withering, Rolling, Oxidation /fermentation and Drying. Among these processes, withering and fermentation are taken place as a result of environmental conditions except rolling and drying. Rolling could be done manually on a serrated timber plank as the quantity is small. Dholes followed by the above three processes are fed into the innovative dryer for the making of tea. This dryer was completed as two stages with two cylinders having concentric perforated cylinders inside. Two hot air generators are being used to supply the hot air where saw dust is burnt for the supply of thermal energy for the first stage drying and the electricity is used in second stage drying, The cylinders are rotating at the same speed of about 12 rpm, and screw feeder is used for the feeding of material into rotating inner cylinder at a constant rate without the material being clogged at the entrance. Analyzing the direction of material and hot air flow inside the cylinder the dryer {{is said to be the}} type of cross-flow co-current. The two drums and the material feeder are powered by a single motor of ½ hp with a gearing ratio of 1 : 30. As the heat transfer is direct from the heat transfer medium to product the dryer is also called direct or adiabatic dryer. The adiabatic dryer is more closely related to the humidification process than is the indirect one. As per the raw material and other drying parameters, the dryer type for the innovative dryer has been selected as cross flow, co current rotary type considering physical properties of the drying materials. Testing of this innovative dryer under real conditions and its results are further illustrated in the report. Based on the physical and thermodynamic parameters of the design and experimental data, a mathematical model has been developed studying various drying models and simulation methods using experimental figures in the report in details. The mathematical model and simulated results using Matlab show how far the model relate with the actual performance. The accuracy of simulation results of the mathematical model is highly depend upon the accuracy of the experiments carried out at various situations for finding out the dryer constant and the characteristic constants using physical models.
