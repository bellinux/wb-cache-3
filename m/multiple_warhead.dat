This led Livermore to specialize in small-diameter tactical weapons, particularly ones using two-point implosion systems, such as the Swan. Small-diameter tactical weapons became primaries for small-diameter secondaries. Around 1960, when the superpower arms race became a ballistic missile race, Livermore warheads were more useful than the large, heavy Los Alamos warheads. Los Alamos warheads were used on the first intermediate-range ballistic missiles, IRBMs, but smaller Livermore warheads were used on the first intercontinental ballistic missiles, ICBMs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, SLBMs, {{as well as on}} the first <b>multiple</b> <b>warhead</b> systems on such missiles.|$|E

50|$|A {{multiple}} {{reentry vehicle}} payload for a ballistic missile deploys <b>multiple</b> <b>warheads</b> {{in a pattern}} against a single target (as opposed to multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle, which deploys <b>multiple</b> <b>warheads</b> against <b>multiple</b> targets). The advantage of an MRV over a single warhead is that the damage produced {{in the center of}} the pattern is far greater than the damage possible from any single warhead in the MRV cluster; this makes for an efficient area attack weapon. The number of warheads makes interception by anti-ballistic missiles unlikely.|$|R
5000|$|An RT-2PM Topol {{with two}} MIRVs {{may have been}} tested in 1991, and the missile was tested at least once with four MIRV warheads, but there has {{apparently}} been no further development of a <b>multiple</b> <b>warhead</b> version. This became a point of contention during {{the conclusion of the}} 1991 START negotiations, at which time the US pressed for a definition of [...] "downloading" [...] (removing warheads from missiles) that would complicate any Soviet attempt suddenly to deploy multiple warheads on the RT-2PM Topol.|$|E
50|$|The yield-to-weight {{ratio is}} the amount of weapon yield {{compared}} to the mass of the weapon. The practical maximum yield-to-weight ratio for fusion weapons (thermonuclear weapons) has been estimated to six megatons of TNT per metric ton of bomb mass (25 TJ/kg). Yields of 5.2 megatons/ton and higher have been reported for large weapons constructed for single-warhead use in the early 1960s. Since then, the smaller warheads needed to achieve the increased net damage efficiency (bomb damage/bomb weight) of <b>multiple</b> <b>warhead</b> systems, has resulted in decreases in the yield/weight ratio for single modern warheads.|$|E

50|$|The {{progressive}} phase-out of the B-47 and KC-97 {{from the}} USAF inventory {{in the mid-1960s}} brought the end of SAC's Reflex operations and to the 7th Air Division in Europe. The advent of reliable <b>multiple</b> <b>warhead</b> Intercontinental ballistic missiles based in the United States and intercontinental B-52 bombers with inflight refueling capability made many of SAC's UK bases redundant. By 1966 SAC had transferred some of its UK bases to USAFE and reduced its operations to a reconnaissance and aerial refueling Detachment at RAF Upper Heyford. Some of these bases, (Upper Heyford) were used to accommodate the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing in 1965, (RAF Mildenall) at the 513th Troop Carrier Wing in 1966, being relocated from France, while others were returned to RAF control or put into standby status (Chevelston, Fairford, Greenham Common).|$|E
40|$|The Russian Duma, {{the lower}} house of the Russian Parliament {{approved}} ratification of the START II Treaty on April 14, 2000, after 7 years of debate and dissension. (The United States Senate approved ratification of the treaty in January 1996.) This report describes key concerns raised by Members of the Duma during their discussions of START II. These include concerns with treaty provisions, such as its ban on <b>multiple</b> <b>warhead</b> ICBMs and its warhead "downloading" provisions, and concerns with Russia's ability to maintain and finance its strategic nuclear forces in the future...|$|E
50|$|More {{advanced}} systems, such as multiple independently targetable {{reentry vehicles}} (MIRVs), can launch <b>multiple</b> <b>warheads</b> at different targets from one missile, reducing {{the chance of}} a successful missile defense.

5000|$|Born in Oregon, Graham {{grew up in}} Seattle, Washington, {{where he}} was a {{graffiti}} artist. He wrote and illustrated comic books for Antarctic Press and Radio Comix, but got his start drawing pornographic comics such as Pillow Fight, Perverts of the Unknown and the initial issue of <b>Multiple</b> <b>Warheads</b> (Warheads would go on to become an ongoing, more mainstream comic published by Oni Press in 2007). In 1997, he moved to New York City where he found work with NBM Publishing and became a founding member of comics collective Meathaus. His book Escalator was published by Alternative Comics in January 2005, when he returned to Seattle. His book King City was published by Tokyopop in 2007 and was nominated for an Eisner Award. In May 2009 Graham announced that King City would continue publication at Image Comics and his Oni Press title <b>Multiple</b> <b>Warheads</b> would resume publication after a delay, this time in color.|$|R

5000|$|The Jakarta Post has relayed {{concerns}} {{from the}} Indonesian Institution for Strategic Studies that such technology may pose possible security threats, noting that Greenpeace {{claims that the}} nuclear plants in the ASEAN region could collectively hypothetically produce material for <b>multiple</b> <b>warheads.</b> Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia have signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, as well as Burma (Myanmar) itself. [...] These activities are not incompatible with Myanmar's obligations under the NPT, and are consistent with Article IV.|$|R
50|$|The MKV {{mission was}} to destroy medium-range through intercontinental-range {{ballistic}} missiles equipped with <b>multiple</b> <b>warheads</b> or countermeasures by using a single interceptor missile. During an actual hostile ballistic missile attack, the carrier vehicle with its cargo of small kill vehicles would have maneuvered {{into the path of}} an enemy missile. Using tracking data from the Ballistic Missile Defense System and its own seeker, the carrier vehicle would have dispensed and guided the kill vehicles to destroy any warheads or countermeasures.|$|R
50|$|The V-1000 missile {{system was}} {{nonetheless}} considered not reliable enough and abandoned {{in favour of}} nuclear-armed ABMs. A much larger missile, the Fakel 5V61 (known in the west as Galosh), was developed to carry the larger warhead and carry it much further from the launch site. Further development continued, and the A-35 anti-ballistic missile system, designed to protect Moscow, became operational in 1971. A-35 was designed for exoatmospheric interceptions, {{and would have been}} highly susceptible to a well-arranged attack using <b>multiple</b> <b>warheads</b> and radar black-out techniques.|$|R
50|$|De-alerting {{may require}} {{negotiations}} and verification procedures {{in order to}} accomplish symmetrical force reductions on both sides. However, de-alerting can occur rapidly if sufficient political will exists, e.g., in 1991, the Bush and Gorbachev Presidential Nuclear Initiatives resulted in the de-alerting of US and Soviet strategic bombers and the storage of their nuclear weapons, as well as the early retirement of 503 ICBMs, including 134 with <b>multiple</b> <b>warheads</b> scheduled for elimination under START I. The process eventually led to a reduction of 17,000 deployed tactical nuclear weapons, the deepest reductions in nuclear arsenals to date.|$|R
50|$|Graham {{reflected}} on his enjoyment of producing the episode, {{explaining that he}} wrote {{the beginning and end}} parts while Moynihan filled in the middle. A show driven by its artists, Graham found that working on Adventure Time left a lasting impression on the way he writes comics—most notably, his <b>Multiple</b> <b>Warheads</b> strip. Aired originally on April 23, 2015, on Cartoon Network, over {{a million and a half}} viewers watched the episode, including Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club, who gave the episode an A grade in his review for the website.|$|R
50|$|Solid {{propellant}} rockets {{are much}} easier to store and handle than liquid propellant rockets. High propellant density makes for compact size as well. These features plus simplicity and low cost make solid propellant rockets ideal for military applications. In the 1970s and 1980s the U.S. switched entirely to solid-fueled ICBMs: the LGM-30 Minuteman and LG-118A Peacekeeper (MX). In the 1980s and 1990s, the USSR/Russia also deployed solid-fueled ICBMs (RT-23, RT-2PM, and RT-2UTTH), but retains two liquid-fueled ICBMs (R-36 and UR-100N). All solid-fueled ICBMs on both sides had three initial solid stages, and those with <b>multiple</b> independently targeted <b>warheads</b> had a precision maneuverable bus used to fine tune the trajectory of the re-entry vehicles. U.S. Minuteman III ICBMs were reduced to a single warhead by 2011 {{in accordance with the}} START treaty leaving only the Navy's Trident sub-launched ICBMs with <b>multiple</b> <b>warheads.</b>|$|R
50|$|The DF-41 (or CSS-X-10) is an {{intercontinental}} {{ballistic missile}} believed to be under development by China. It may be designed to carry Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV), delivering <b>multiple</b> nuclear <b>warheads.</b>|$|R
25|$|Improvements in warhead {{miniaturization}} in the 1970s and 1980s {{allowed for}} the development of MIRVs—missiles which could carry <b>multiple</b> <b>warheads,</b> each of which could be separately targeted. The question of whether these missiles should be based on constantly rotating train tracks (to avoid being easily targeted by opposing Soviet missiles) or based in heavily fortified silos (to possibly withstand a Soviet attack) was a major political controversy in the 1980s (eventually the silo deployment method was chosen). MIRVed systems enabled the U.S. to render Soviet missile defenses economically unfeasible, as each offensive missile would require between three and ten defensive missiles to counter.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} tracking a target that may split, several times, into separate targets, such that each split becomes an autonomous target. This setting arises, for example, when an aircraft launches a series of missiles, or a ballistic missile with <b>multiple</b> <b>warheads</b> breaks into pieces in the reentry phase. The problem is cast into a framework proposed in an earlier work and formulated using a single, generalized statespace model with randomly switching coefficients. Consequently, {{the states of the}} original target, {{as well as of the}} splits thereof, are tracked efficiently using a single IMM-like algorithm. I...|$|R

Stability increases as the number of weapons per missile is reduced. The optimal allocation of weapons between missiles and value is significant in predicting the stability impact of the reduction of the number of weapons per missile at large numbers of missiles, less significant in reducing the number of missiles for fixed weapons per missile. At low numbers of missiles, the stability indices for singlet and triplet configurations are comparable, as are the number of weapons each would deliver on value targets...|$|R
