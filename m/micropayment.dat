5|$|As {{technical}} director of Digital's Corporate Strategy Group, Kotok {{was instrumental in}} creating the Internet Business Group which advocated early adoption and integration of Internet and Web-based technologies. Digital created the AltaVista search engine, the Internet firewall, the Web portal, the webcast and live election returns. Digital continued its lead in Internet and Web development through difficult times, but Kotok questioned a corporate strategy that he believed consumed Web and Internet resources to sell Digital products like the AlphaServer. For example, he saw a missed opportunity in Millicent, the <b>micropayment</b> system for buying and selling Web content for fractions of a U.S. cent.|$|E
5|$|A PlayStation 3 {{version of}} Oblivion was {{released}} on March 20, 2007 in North America, and April 27, 2007 in Europe, following delays similar to those for the Xbox 360 release.

A two-week free trial version first became available for PC on July 31, 2014, with PlayStation 3 and 4 versions following in December. This two-week limitation was removed in March 2017; free trial players can access all content up to level 35 with no time restrictions. The Chinese version, published and administrated by Shanda Games, premiered on August 29, 2014 featuring content through patch 2.16. It features separate servers from the other language versions of the game and a pay-per-hour <b>micropayment</b> billing system. The Korean version, distributed by Actoz Soft, launched in South Korea on August 14, 2015 with content from patch 2.2. This version carries a flexible subscription model with increments as low as 5 hours, similar to the Chinese release, up to 90 days, much like the traditional monthly payment plan.|$|E
2500|$|Joe Zabel {{explained}} in 2006 {{that he believed}} micropayments were necessary for webcomics that couldn't be appreciated on advertisement-saturated websites, which he describes as [...] "introverted" [...] webcomics. However, the popular webcomic hosting services of its time [...] Comic Genesis and Webcomics Nation [...] had not built in any support for <b>micropayment</b> systems, and the concept had not yet gained any momentum. McCloud became an advisor for <b>micropayment</b> service BitPass in 2002, but this service was shut down in 2007 {{because of a lack}} of commercially successful clients and because, according to McCloud himself, [...] "it still wasn't simple enough for a lot of people." [...] Since then, other <b>micropayment</b> systems have launched, including PayPal Micropayments, Flattr and SatoshiPay, but by 2015 the idea of micropayments still hadn't panned out as McCloud had initially described it.|$|E
2500|$|Some MMORPGs require payment or {{a monthly}} {{subscription}} to play. By definition, [...] "massively multiplayer" [...] games are always online, and most require {{some sort of}} continuous revenue (such as monthly subscriptions and advertisements) for maintenance and development purposes. Some games, such as Guild Wars have disposed of the 'monthly fee' model entirely, and recover costs directly through sales of the software and associated expansion packs. Still, others adopt a <b>micropayment</b> model where the core content is free, but players are given the option to purchase additional content, such as equipment, aesthetic items, or pets. Games that make use of this model often have originated in Korea, such as Flyff and MapleStory. This business model is alternately called [...] "pay for perks" [...] or [...] "freemium", and games using it often describe themselves with the term [...] "free-to-play".|$|E
50|$|<b>Micropayments</b> were {{initially}} devised {{as a way}} of allowing the sale of online content and as a way to pay for very low cost network services. They were envisioned to involve small fractions of a cent, as little as US$0.0001 to a few cents. <b>Micropayments</b> would enable people to sell content on the Internet and would be an alternative to advertising revenue.|$|R

2500|$|Stallman has {{regularly}} given a talk entitled [...] "Copyright vs. Community" [...] {{where he}} reviews {{the state of}} DRM and names many of the products and corporations which he boycotts. His approach to DRM is best summed up by the FSF Defective by Design campaign. In the talks, he makes proposals for a [...] "reduced copyright" [...] and suggests a 10-year limit on copyright. He suggests that, instead of restrictions on sharing, authors be supported using a tax, with revenues distributed among them based on cubic roots of their popularity to ensure that [...] "fairly successful non-stars" [...] receive a greater share than they do now (compare with private copying levy which is associated with proponents of strong copyright), or a convenient anonymous <b>micropayment</b> system for people to support authors directly. He indicates that no form of non-commercial sharing of copies {{should be considered a}} copyright violation. He has advocated civil disobedience in a comment on Ley Sinde.|$|E
2500|$|Free-to-play is newer {{than the}} pay to play model, and {{the video game}} {{industry}} is still attempting {{to determine the best}} ways to maximize revenue from their games. Gamers have cited the fact that purchasing a game for a fixed price is still inherently satisfying because the consumer knows exactly what they will be receiving, compared to free-to-play which requires that the player pay for most new content that they wish to obtain. The term itself, [...] "free-to-play", has been described as one with a negative connotation. One video game developer noted this, stating, [...] "Our hope—and the basket we're putting our eggs in—is that 'free' will soon be disassociated with [...] 'shallow' and 'cruddy'." [...] However, another noted that developing freeware games gave developers the largest amount of creative freedom, especially when compared to developing console games, which requires that the game follow the criteria as laid out by the game's publisher. Many kinds of revenue are being experimented with. For example, with its Free Realms game targeted to children and casual gamers, Sony makes money from the product with advertisements on loading screens, free virtual goods sponsored by companies such as Best Buy, a subscription option to unlock extra content, a collectible card game, a comic book, and <b>micropayment</b> items that include character customization options.|$|E

40|$|On the {{assumption}} that the current WWW is a precursor to full commercial networked hypermedia systems this paper examines how payments can be made on the Internet. We have identified two classes of payments. <b>Micropayments</b> would typically be charged per link access and are between 1 / 100 or a cent and $ 1. Macropayments are larger payments above $ 1. Several payment schemes have been proposed for networked services and electronic commerce. The schemes are roughly divided into electronic cash, electronic cheque and electronic credit card. This paper evaluates each of these proposals for their suitability for <b>micropayments</b> and concluded that with current Internet charging all the schemes fail. This paper proposes a simple method of providing <b>micropayments.</b> 1.

40|$|Personalised, location-related and {{differentiated}} {{services in}} the mobile digital economy create a demand for suitable pricing models. In the case of disaggregated “microservices” (e. g., small digitalized information or service units), {{as well as for}} the acquisition of low-value physical goods, the deployment of <b>micropayments</b> seems appropriate. This paper analyzes the economic efficiency of marginal transaction amounts in the m-commerce area by applying the theoretical approach of transaction cost economics. For this purpose, a separation of technical and cognitive transaction costs is applied. The influence of selected determinants such as specifity, uncertainty and bounded rationality on transaction costs in mobile commerce <b>micropayments</b> is analyzed. The result is a more likely application of <b>micropayments</b> for physical goods such as beverages or parking tickets than for digital goods and services, given the theoretical assumptions of the model. In addition, indicators for a significant above-zero lower limit of transaction amounts in mobile commerce are presented...|$|R
5000|$|An {{unexplored}} {{but potentially}} disruptive arena for data monetization {{is the use}} of Bitcoin <b>micropayments</b> for data transactions. Because Bitcoins are emerging as competitors with payment services like Visa or PayPal that can readily enable and reduce or eliminate transaction costs, transactions for as little as a single data item can be facilitated. Consumers as well as enterprises who desire to monetize their participation in a data supply chain may soon be able to access social network enabled Bitcoin exchanges and platforms. [...] Clickbait and data hijacking may wither as <b>micropayments</b> for data are ubiquitous and enabled. Potentially, even the current need to build out data broker managed data trading exchanges may be bypassed. Stanley Smith, who introduced the notion of the data supply chain, has said that simple <b>micropayments</b> for data monetization are the key to evolution of ubiquitous implementation of user configurable data supply schemata, enabling data monetization on a universal scale for all data creators, including the burgeoning internet of things.|$|R
