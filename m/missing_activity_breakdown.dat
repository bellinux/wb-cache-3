40|$|Abstract Background Because of {{the paucity}} of {{effective}} evidence-based therapies for children with recurrent abdominal pain, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of guided imagery, a well-studied self-regulation technique. Methods 22 children, aged 5 – 18 years, were randomized to learn either breathing exercises alone or guided imagery with progressive muscle relaxation. Both groups had 4 -weekly sessions with a therapist. Children reported the numbers of days with pain, the pain intensity, and <b>missed</b> <b>activities</b> due to abdominal pain using a daily pain diary collected at baseline and during the intervention. Monthly phone calls to the children reported {{the number of days}} with pain and the number of days of <b>missed</b> <b>activities</b> experienced during the month of and month following the intervention. Children with ≤ 4 days of pain/month and no <b>missed</b> <b>activities</b> due to pain were defined as being healed. Depression, anxiety, and somatization were measured in both children and parents at baseline. Results At baseline the children who received guided imagery had more days of pain during the preceding month (23 vs. 14 days, P = 0. 04). There were no differences in the intensity of painful episodes or any baseline psychological factors between the two groups. Children who learned guided imagery with progressive muscle relaxation had significantly greater {{decrease in the number of}} days with pain than those learning breathing exercises alone after one (67 % vs. 21 %, P = 0. 05), and two (82 % vs. 45 %, P Conclusion The therapeutic efficacy of guided imagery with progressive muscle relaxation found in this study is consistent with our present understanding of the pathophysiology of recurrent abdominal pain in children.

40|$|Abstract. Leaf litter inputs {{have been}} {{excluded}} from 1 of 2 Ist-order streams at Coweeta Hydro-logic Laboratory, North Carolina since August 1993 {{to examine the}} bottom-up effects of resource reduction on stream ecosystems. As {{part of the larger}} project, we studied the effect of litter exclusion on the extracellular enzyme activity and fungal biomass of wood biofilms in the presence and absence of leaf litter. Replicate strips of wood veneer were incubated in both streams for 28, 58, and 86 d. Ergosterol content (to estimate fungal biomass), the activity of 5 lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, acid phosphatase <b>activity,</b> <b>breakdown</b> rates, and % organic matter were determined when the veneer strips were collected. Hydrolytic enzyme <b>activity</b> and wood <b>breakdown</b> rates in the litter-excluded stream were significantly higher than in the reference stream. Enzyme activities of all hydrolytic enzymes were highly correlated with each other. Measurement of relative activities of selected extra-cellular enzymes comparing carbon and nutrient acquisition suggested nutrient limitation of hetero-trophic biofilms in the reference stream. Microbial activity of wood biofilms was significantly altered by the exclusion of leaf litter, and hydrolytic enzyme activity, as an indicator of carbon cycling, was higher on wood in streams without leaf litter.

Early effects of intralesional treatment were more moderate.
