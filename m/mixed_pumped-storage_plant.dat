50|$|Hydroelectricity is Japan's main {{renewable}} energy source, with an installed capacity of about 50 GW (including pumped storage) and {{a production of}} 69.2 TWh of electricity in 2009, making Japan {{one of the biggest}} hydroelectricity producers in the world.Most of Japanese hydroelectric power <b>plants</b> are <b>pumped-storage</b> <b>plants.</b> Conventional hydropower plants account for about 20 GW out of the total installed capacity as of 2007.|$|R

50|$|The major {{advantage}} of conventional hydroelectric systems with reservoirs is {{their ability to}} store potential power for later electrical production on demand.

2500|$|The Tennessee Valley Authority, with {{administrative}} operations {{headquartered in}} Knoxville and power operations headquartered in Chattanooga, provides {{most of the}} region's electricity via its hydroelectric dams as well as coal-fired plants near Kingston and Rogersville, the Watts Bar Nuclear Generating Station, the Raccoon Mountain <b>Pumped-Storage</b> <b>Plant,</b> and a wind-powered facility atop Buffalo Mountain near Oak Ridge. [...] In recent years, TVA's effectiveness has been debated, with some arguing it saved East Tennessee from a bleak future, and others claiming the agency is a mismanaged, wasteful bureaucracy.|$|R
2500|$|These {{systems may}} be {{economical}} because they flatten out load {{variations on the}} power grid, permitting thermal power stations such as coal-fired plants and nuclear power plants that provide base-load electricity to continue operating at peak efficiency, while reducing the need for [...] "peaking" [...] power plants that use the same fuels as many base-load thermal plants, gas and oil, but have been designed for flexibility rather than maximal efficiency. Hence pumped storage systems are crucial when coordinating large groups of heterogeneous generators. However, capital costs for <b>pumped-storage</b> <b>plants</b> are relatively high.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} the authors present a {{necessary}} condition for minimum of a functional J(z) ≔∫ 0 TL(t,z(t),z′(t)) dt in the case in which the function L is continuous but not of class C 1. This situation arises in problems of optimization of hydrothermal systems with <b>pumped-storage</b> <b>plants.</b> In such problems, the function Lz′(t,z,·) is discontinuous in z′= 0, which is the borderline point between the power generation zone (z′> 0) and the pumping zone (z′< 0). The problem can be naturally formulated in the framework of nonsmooth analysis, using the generalized (or Clarke's) gradient...|$|R
