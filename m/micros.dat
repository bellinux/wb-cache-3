40|$|Research and {{development}} of the <b>micro</b> machine which is called MEMS (<b>Micro</b> Electro Mechanical System) have been done with the big expectations of many people, since a birth of the <b>micro</b> machine in the 1980 s. In the big expectations toward the <b>micro</b> machine, many people have been waiting for appearing of a new machine which had not been gained in the history of man. Under the big expectations of the people, researchers and engineer developed three major methods of photolithography[1], LIGA process[2] and ultra-precise milling[3]. They are produced the <b>micro</b> mechanical parts such as a <b>micro</b> gear, a <b>micro</b> linkage, a <b>micro</b> motor. However, if we choose these methods to make the <b>micro</b> mechanical parts, we have to install huge and expensive facilities. Moreover, if the <b>micro</b> mechanical parts are designed in three dimensionally complex shapes, we can not manufacture by these methods. Therefore, many researchers and engineers wait for the forth method to developed <b>micro</b> mechanical parts with small facilities and simple process and high making ability and without expensive equipments. A novel method to make the <b>micro</b> mechanical parts utilized extra fine wires was developed and a <b>micro</b> screw, a <b>micro</b> nut, a <b>micro</b> helical gear, and a <b>micro</b> turbine impeller were manufactured by the developed method[4]. In this paper, the <b>micro</b> screw with smaller pitch of 40 micrometers and the <b>micro</b> nut with smaller pitch of 40 micrometers and a <b>micro</b> helical gear with smaller module of 18. 1 micrometers are manufactured by a new brazing process.

25|$|As {{dental plaque}} or biofilm accumulates on the teeth near {{and below the}} gums, there is {{a shift in the}} {{composition}} of the biofilm from essentially streptococcus to an actinomyces dominant plaque. Motile bacteria is also seen more frequently. As this happens, inflammation sets in the gingiva. Initially, this takes the form of gingivitis, which represents inflammation confined to the soft tissues above the bone level. Inflammation in the gingiva can remain at the gingivitis level for a long period and will not progress to periodontitis, unless in the presence of local conditions or generalized host susceptibility. When this shift occurs, the immune system's response to plaque accumulation shifts from a predominantly neutrophilic mediated response to lymphocytic and plasma cell-mediated response. Clinically, the gingiva presents swelling, redness and a tendency to bleed. This modifies the environment, leading to changes in the composition of the biofilm itself. As this happens, a predominantly gram-negative environment is established, with periodontal pathogens emerging. These include A. actinomycetemcomitans, the red complex bacteria (P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola) {{and to a lesser extent}} the orange complex bacteria (F. nucleatum, P. <b>micros,</b> P. intermedia, P. nigrecens, E. nodatum and S. constellates). Strongest bacterial association to chronic periodontitis is with P. gingivalis. Numerous virulence factors have been identified for this pathogen. This allows P. gingivalis to elude defense mechanism and perpetuate inflammation inside the periodontium. Prolonged inflammation in the periodontium leads to an apical shift in the attachment of the gingiva to the tooth with deepening pockets and bone loss around the teeth. Untreated periodontitis progresses unevenly over time but results in loss of function, tissue destruction, and tooth loss.|$|E
