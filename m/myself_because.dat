500|$|McCartney {{attempted}} {{recording the}} lead vocal {{only once a}} day. He said: [...] "I came into the studios early {{every day for a}} week to sing it by <b>myself</b> <b>because</b> at first my voice was too clear. I wanted it to sound as though I'd been performing it on stage all week." [...] Lennon thought he should have sung it, remarking that it was more his style.|$|E
500|$|The final alleged {{stalking}} incident came {{to light}} on December 13, 2005. In the preceding days, Cho had contacted a female friend of Koch via AIM and wrote on her door board {{a line from the}} Act 2, Scene II of the Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet. In the passage, Romeo laments to Juliet" [...] a name, I know not how to tell who I am. My name, dear saint, is hateful to <b>myself,</b> <b>because</b> it is an enemy to thee. Had I it written, I would tear the word." ...|$|E
500|$|Harvey {{possesses}} {{an expansive}} contralto vocal range. Harvey dislikes repeating {{herself in her}} music, resulting in very different-sounding albums. In an October 2004 interview with Rolling Stone, she said: [...] "when I'm {{working on a new}} record, {{the most important thing is}} to not repeat myself... that's always my aim: to try and cover new ground and really to challenge <b>myself.</b> <b>Because</b> I'm in this for learning." [...] While her musical style has been described as alternative rock, punk blues, art rock, and avant-rock, she has experimented with various other genres including electronica, indie rock and folk music.|$|E
5000|$|As {{outlined}} above, lesbian feminism typically situates lesbianism {{as a form}} {{of resistance}} to [...] "man-made" [...] institutions. Cheryl Clarke writes in her essay New Notes on Lesbianism [...] "I name <b>myself</b> “lesbian” <b>because</b> this culture oppresses, silences, and destroys lesbians, even lesbians who do don’t call themselves “lesbians.” I name <b>myself</b> “lesbian” <b>because</b> I want to be visible to other black lesbians. I name <b>myself</b> “lesbian” <b>because</b> I do not subscribe to predatory/institutionalized heterosexuality".|$|R

500|$|... "That was a {{conscious}} move by Max and <b>myself,</b> <b>because</b> we {{were listening to}} alternative and indie music and talking about some song– I don't remember what it was. I said, 'Ah, I love this song,' and Max was like, 'If they would just write a damn pop chorus on it!' It was driving him nuts, because that indie song was sort of on six, going to seven, going to eight, the chorus comes ... and it goes back down to five. It drove him crazy. And when he said that, it was like, light bulb. 'Why don't we do that, but put a big chorus on it?' It worked." ...|$|E
500|$|Watson told Ellen DeGeneres {{just before}} {{graduation}} {{that it took}} five years to finish instead of four because, due to her acting work, she [...] "ended up taking two full semesters off". On 25 May 2014, she graduated from Brown University with a bachelor's degree in English literature. In 2013, she became certified to teach yoga and meditation. As part of this certification, she attended a week-long meditation course at a Canadian facility, in which residents {{are not allowed to}} speak, in order [...] "to figure out how to be at home with myself". She told Elle Australia that an uncertain future meant finding [...] "a way to always feel safe and at home within <b>myself.</b> <b>Because</b> I can never rely on a physical place." ...|$|E
500|$|Holly's {{pregnant}} wife, María Elena, {{learned of}} his death from the reports on television. A widow after only six months of marriage, she suffered a miscarriage shortly after, reportedly due to [...] "psychological trauma". Holly's mother, on hearing the news on the radio at home in Lubbock, Texas, screamed and collapsed. María Elena Holly {{did not attend the}} funeral and has never visited the gravesite. She later said in an interview: [...] "In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn't with him. And I blame <b>myself</b> <b>because</b> I know that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane." ...|$|E

500|$|Because {{there was}} no dragon in the {{original}} legend, Mulan did not have animal companions; it was Roy E. Disney who suggested the character of Mushu. Veteran story artist Joe Grant created the cricket character, Cri-Kee for, though animator Barry Temple admitted [...] "the directors didn't want him in the movie, the story department didn't want him in the movie. The only people who truly wanted him in the movie were Michael Eisner and Joe Grant – and <b>myself,</b> <b>because</b> I was assigned the character. I would sit in meetings and they’d say, 'Well, where's the cricket during all this?' Somebody else would say, 'Oh, to hell the cricket.' They felt Cri-Kee was a character who wasn't necessary to tell the story, which is true." [...] Throughout development on the film, Grant would slip sketches of Cri-Kee under the directors' door.|$|E
500|$|In September 2017, PewDiePie {{used the}} racial slur [...] "nigger" [...] while live-streaming PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. As a {{response}} to the incident, Campo Santo co-founder Sean Vanaman referred to PewDiePie as [...] "worse than a closeted racist", announced that Campo Santo would file copyright strikes against PewDiePie's videos featuring the studio's game Firewatch, and encouraged other game developers to do the same. PewDiePie later uploaded a short video apologizing for the language he used during the live-stream, expressing [...] "I'm not going to make any excuses to why it did because there are no excuses for it. I'm disappointed in <b>myself</b> <b>because</b> it seems like I've learned nothing from all these past controversies, [...] was not okay. I'm really sorry if I offended, hurt or disappointed anyone with all of this. Being in the position that I am, I should know better." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Love the Way You Lie" [...] and [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" [...] {{were based}} on a demo written and {{recorded}} in late 2009 by Grey. Grey told PopEater [...] "I wrote the demo initially for <b>myself</b> <b>because</b> I thought, ‘Oh, I have this big song, and now I {{have a little bit of}} a launching pad to put out my own stuff." [...] Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying [...] "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision if I was going to let them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna’s album, too." [...] The demo track by Grey is on her extended play The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey, which was released on January 17, 2012.|$|E

500|$|Soon after {{completing}} [...] "Make It Happen", Carey eagerly presented the final {{song on the}} set list, [...] "I'll Be There". The way the song was arranged, Carey took Michael Jackson's lead, while Trey Lorenz sang the second lead, originally sung by Jermaine Jackson. After performing the sung alongside a very simple arrangement and minimal instrumentals, the back-up singers began humming {{to the tune of}} [...] "Can't Let Go", leading Carey to present [...] "another final" [...] song for the show. Several days after the concert, Carey sat down with Melinda Newman from Billboard, telling her of the experience recording the show, as well as her view on it from a creative perspective. She said [...] "Unplugged taught me a lot about <b>myself</b> <b>because</b> I tend to nitpick everything I do and make it a bit too perfect because I'm a perfectionist. I'll always go over the raw stuff, and now I've {{gotten to the point where}} I understand the raw stuff is usually better." ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga had posted some of {{the lyrics}} of the song in February 2011, and next month she {{revealed}} more lyrics for [...] "Judas" [...] in the Google interview. Gaga also confirmed that the song {{was influenced by the}} Biblical Judas Iscariot. According to Popjustice, lyrically on the surface [...] "Judas" [...] is a song about being double-crossed and contemplating revenge, but being repeatedly drawn to awfulness. The middle eight of the song, with the lyrics [...] "But in the cultural sense I just speak in future tense. Judas kiss me if offenced, or wear an ear condom next time", talks about Gaga being beyond the ability to redeem herself, in terms of the traditional views of what a woman is supposed to be. [...] "But I don't want to redeem <b>myself,</b> <b>because</b> in the cultural sense I believe that I'm just before my time. And if you don't like it, wear an ear condom," [...] she explained. The main portion of the song is about Gaga in private and the middle eight is about Gaga in public, two themes that are explored elsewhere on the parent album too.|$|E
500|$|Wanting {{to stray}} {{away from the}} R-styled music of Thankful, which she {{described}} as a showcase of versatility, she revealed that Thankfuls success [...] "empowered me to step more into rock, step more into the soulful vibe." [...] She described {{the music of the}} second album as [...] "like the first CD in the sense that it's versatile, but it's more into the rock, It's more into the soulful roots, and it's just a little bit deeper, so it's pretty cool." [...] Dr. Luke revealed in an interview that alternative music and indie music were inspirations to [...] "Since U Been Gone", saying, [...] "That was a conscious move by Max [...] and <b>myself,</b> <b>because</b> we were listening to alternative and indie music and talking about some song-I don't remember what it was.

6000|$|... "I shall {{learn the}} high-priest's mind and {{think what the}} high-priest thinks," [...] I {{answered}} darkly, though in my heart I was terribly afraid for Merapi, and, to speak truth, for <b>myself</b> also, <b>because</b> of the doubts which arose in me {{and would not be}} quenched.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think, madam," [...] Mr. Bale said, [...] "it {{was as much}} wasted as {{it would}} have been, had they {{swallowed}} it; for at least it did no harm.

500|$|... "Back Up, Dancer" [...] {{was written}} by Tracy Poust and Jon Kinnally and {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on September 23, 2004. It was confirmed in mid-2004 that singer Janet Jackson would guest star as herself on the television series Will & Grace. She recorded her lines {{in front of a}} live audience on August 17. Jackson's role in the show had been her first television acting role in nearly two decades. Jackson's last prime-time role was on NBC's Fame. She also appeared in the television shows Diff'rent Strokes and Good Times. In addition, Jackson's appearance came nine months after the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. She told the entertainment news program Access Hollywood that she was a [...] "big fan" [...] of the show, and that she could not wait to join the cast for her stint. Also in this interview, she believed that Sean Hayes, who plays Jack, was a decent dancer. [...] "I thought he studied dance. I really did, It's so funny. I have to catch <b>myself</b> <b>because</b> I'm cracking up in rehearsals. It's just funny to watch [...]" [...] Jackson [...] "had a tough time" [...] on the set because she constantly messed up her lines. She admitted that it was not as easy as she had hoped it would be. [...] "I flubbed my lines and got so frustrated when I made those mistakes. I haven't done TV since Different Strokes, and it's not like Saturday Night Live where you can read cue cards. On Will & Grace, they're always rewriting, so you're always memorising." [...] Jackson, however, said that the dancing was the [...] "easy part of playing myself".|$|E
2500|$|Whenever Shi Yi {{recommended}} {{talents to}} Sun Quan, he only pointed out {{their strengths and}} said nothing about their weaknesses. Sun Quan thus chided him for not saying anything about their weaknesses and not making judgments about them. In response, Shi Yi said, [...] "Your Majesty, as your subject, my duty is to perform my role well. I am always worried about not being competent in my role. (I keep my opinions about their weaknesses to <b>myself</b> <b>because)</b> I don't want to let my ignorance and limited knowledge affect Your Majesty's judgment about them." ...|$|E
2500|$|McCartney later {{described}} {{the tone of}} Starr's message as [...] "the party line", to which he reacted badly: [...] "I told [...] to get out. I {{had to do something}} like that in order to assert <b>myself</b> <b>because</b> I was just sinking... I was getting pummelled about the head, in my mind anyway." [...] According to Starr, McCartney [...] "went crazy", threatening: [...] "I'll finish you now. You'll pay!" [...] Although the other Beatles backed down over the release of McCartney, the confrontation initiated what Rodriguez terms [...] "a three-against-one war" [...] within the band.|$|E
6000|$|... "Engleton," [...] he said, [...] "don't be a fool. It can do you no {{particular}} good to ruin Cecil here and <b>myself,</b> just <b>because</b> {{you happen to}} be suspicious.

2500|$|Parker {{is a part}} of {{the large}} and diverse Perth music scene, where he plays in various {{different}} bands in addition to his main project, Tame Impala. Commenting on this, Parker said [...] "it's a really close-knit scene, quiet, separated from the rest of Australia" [...] and [...] "Tame Impala is just one sliver of the giant amount of noise-making that we do as a circle of friends. I don't feel bad doing the recording by <b>myself</b> <b>because</b> I don't expect that input in their bands...to us Tame Impala is just Kevin Parker's project and everyone has a project." ...|$|E
2500|$|I went to {{the front}} office all the time, and I would say, [...] "John is kicking the dogs and putting them into freezers." [...] Or I would say, [...] "They are {{stepping}} on the animals, crushing them like grapes, and they don't care." [...] In the end, I would go to work early, before anyone got there, and I would just kill the animals <b>myself.</b> <b>Because</b> I couldn't stand to let them go through that. I must have killed a thousand of them, sometimes dozens every day. Some of those people would take pleasure in making them suffer. Driving home every night, I would cry just thinking about it. And I just felt, to my bones, this cannot be right.|$|E
2500|$|In a May 2011 {{interview}} with The New York Times, Cramer {{explained that he}} was unprepared for Stewart's intense interview, saying [...] "As soon as he started, I realized Stewart was on a mission to make me look like a clown. I didn't defend <b>myself</b> <b>because</b> I wasn't prepared. What was I supposed to do, talk about how often I had been right? Praise myself? Get mad? I was mad, but I didn't want to give the audience any blood. The national media said I got crushed, which I did, and made me into a buffoon... They wanted to make me the Face of the Era, and they succeeded. Rick Santelli's a conservative. Ideological. O.K., I get that. But me? I was very anti-Bush.
