First, the C-SiO 2 nanopowders {{are ideal for}} fingerprint development, yielding strong contrast against <b>multicoloured</b> and patterned <b>backgrounds.</b> Second, spontaneous nanoparticle aggregation leads to non-duplicable, inexpensive nanotags that can support sustainable technologies to combat counterfeiting...|$|R
