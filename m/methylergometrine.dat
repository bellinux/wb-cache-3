40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} and {{side effects of}} misoprostol, compared with <b>methylergometrine,</b> {{for the prevention of}} postpartum haemorrhage. DESIGN: A double-blind, randomised clinical trial of 200 women with apparently normal pregnancies. SETTING: University teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred women with apparently normal pregnancies. METHODS: After the baby had been born, all women received two capsules by mouth and the contents of an ampule by intravenous injection. Each woman only received one active product. The capsules contained either a total of 600 microg misoprostol or placebo, and the ampule 200 microg of <b>methylergometrine</b> or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Need for further oxytocic drugs, blood pressure, the presence of side effects, mean haemoglobin and haematocrit three days after delivery. RESULTS: Two hundred women completed the study (100 received <b>methylergometrine</b> and 100 misoprostol). Postpartum haemorrhage occurred in 4. 3 % of the <b>methylergometrine</b> group and 8. 3 % of the misoprostol group (P = 0. 57). The need for further oxytocic drugs was 4. 4 % and 12. 8 % after <b>methylergometrine</b> and misoprostol, respectively (P = 0. 065). One hour after the birth of the baby {{there was no difference in}} the mean systolic blood pressure (117 +/- 12 mmHg versus 115 +/- 11 mmHg) (P = 0. 26) or the mean diastolic blood pressure (72 +/- 10 mmHg versus 71 +/- 11 mmHg for the groups receiving <b>methylergometrine</b> or misoprostol, respectively) (P = 0. 97). The mean temperature in the misoprostol group rose to 37. 4 degrees C, compared with 37 degrees C in the <b>methylergometrine</b> group (P 38 degrees C) compared with 3 % in the <b>methylergometrine</b> group (P or = 8) also occurred more often after misoprostol (42 %) than after <b>methylergometrine</b> (8. 5 %) (P < 0. 0001). The haemoglobin level (g/dL) on the third postpartum day was similar for both groups (11. 0 and 11. 2 for <b>methylergometrine</b> and misoprostol, respectively) (P = 0. 39).

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study to compare breast milk {{pharmacokinetics}} between misoprostol 200 mg and <b>methylergometrine</b> 250 mg after single oral dosing in women who require postpartum uterotonic therapy. Study design: Open prospective randomized phase I study measuring misoprostol and <b>methylergometrine</b> on postpartum days 3 to 6 in milk 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours postdose, and in maternal serum at 0. 5 and 1 hours (misoprostol) and 1 and 2 hours (<b>methylergometrine)</b> in 10 lactating women per group. Results: Milk misoprostol levels rose and declined rapidly, which gave a milk elimination half-life of less than one half that of <b>methylergometrine</b> (meanG SE, 1. 1 G 0. 3 hours [median, 0. 6 hours] vs 2. 33 G 0. 3 hours [median, 1. 9 hours]; PZ. 003). Milk/plasma ratios for misoprostol were one third of those for <b>methylergometrine</b> at 1 hour (P!. 0001) and 2 hours (P!. 0015). Conclusion: Misoprostol warrants further investigation as an alternative to postpartum <b>methylergometrine</b> because it enters and leaves breast milk at twice the rate, with one third of the milk/plasma ratio, which significantly lowers infant exposure and facilitates a timeddosing regimen. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Background: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of 600 mcg of oral misoprostol with 0. 2 mg of injection <b>methylergometrine</b> {{for the prevention of}} post partum hemorrhage. Methods: 200 apparently normal pregnant women were randomized to receive either 600 mcg of oral misoprostol (study group) after delivery of baby or 0. 2 mg of <b>methylergometrine</b> intravenously (control group) after delivery of placenta. Primary outcome was to know the incidence of post partum hemorrhage in both the groups. Secondary outcome measures were to look for mean blood loss, need for any other uterotonic agents, need for blood transfusion, need for surgical intervention, mean duration of third stage and side effects of both the drugs. Results: Out of 200 cases, two cases were excluded for the final analysis. Incidence of PPH was 9 % in misoprostol group & 6 % in <b>methylergometrine</b> group which was not significant (p > 0. 05). There were no significant differences among both the groups in mean blood loss, duration of bleeding, need for further oxytocics and duration of third stage.

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{third stage}} of labour {{is indeed the}} unforgiving stage of the labour and in it lurks more unheralded treachery than in both the other stages of labour combined. Many lifesaving drugs have been {{discovered}} and used {{for the management of}} this stage of labour. According to the WHO multicentric randomised trial using oral misoprostol with oxytocic, they concluded that oral misoprostol was associated with significantly high incidence of side effects like shivering and rise in body temperature and hence oxytocin is preferred to 600 mg of oral misoprostol in management of 3 rd stage of labour in hospital settings, but still misoprostol has been suggested for the management of third stage of labour in developing countries, because it has strong uterotonic effects, can be given orally, inexpensive and does not need refrigeration. The aim of the study is to compare oxytocin, misoprostol, <b>methylergometrine</b> for active management of the third stage of labour. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 300 women of 37 weeks to 42 weeks of gestation delivering vaginally in Konaseema Institute of Medical Sciences, Amalapuram, Andhra Pradesh. 300 women allocated into 3 groups of 100 each to receive 10 IU I. M. oxytocin, 600 mcg sublingual misoprostol or 200 mcg I. M. <b>methylergometrine,</b> respectively. Primary outcome measure was blood loss in the third stage of labor; secondary measures were duration of the third stage, side effects and complications. RESULTS Subjects who received 600 mcg of misoprostol had the least blood loss (113 mL), followed by oxytocin and <b>methylergometrine.</b> The shortest mean duration of the third stage was with misoprostol (4. 34 mins.). Shivering and pyrexia were observed in misoprostol group and raised blood pressure in <b>methylergometrine</b> group. CONCLUSION Misoprostol is as effective as oxytocin and both are more effective than <b>methylergometrine</b> in active management of the third stage of labour. Misoprostol therefore can be used in places where facilities of storage and parenteral administration of oxytocin is limited. ...|$|E

40|$|Harold Wolff’s {{theory of}} {{vasodilation}} in migraine is well-known. Less known is {{his search for}} a perivascular factor that would damage local tissues and increase pain sensitivity during migraine attacks. Serotonin {{was found to be}} among the candidate agents to be included. In the same period, serotonin was isolated (1948) and, because of its actions, an anti-serotonin drug was needed. Methy-sergide was synthesized from lysergic acid (LSD) by adding a methyl group and a butanolamid group. This resulted in a compound with selectivity and high potency as a serotonin (5 -HT) inhibitor. Based on the possible involvement of serotonin in migraine attacks, it was introduced in 1959 by Sicuteri as a preventive drug for migraine. The clinical effect was often excellent, but 5 years later it was found to cause retroperitoneal fibrosis after chronic intake. Conse-quently, the use of the drug in migraine declined considerably, but it was still used as a 5 -HT antagonist in experimental studies. In 1974 Saxena showed that methysergide had a selective vasoconstrictor effect in the carotid bed and in 1984 he found an atypical receptor. This finding provided an incentive for the development of sumatriptan. Bredberg et al. showed that methysergide is prob-ably a prodrug for its active metabolite <b>methylergometrine.</b> Whereas methyser-gide is ‘a clean drug’, <b>methylergometrine</b> is ‘a relatively dirty drug ’ with additional dopaminergic activity.

40|$|AimsTo {{assess whether}} {{abnormal}} dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) {{can be a}} consequence of dobutamine-induced coronary spasm in patients with angiographically documented vasospastic coronary arteries. MethodsBetween January 2004 and April 2008, we prospectively evaluated all patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) referred to the echocardiography laboratory for dobutamine stress tests (6061 examinations). Those with abnormal DSE underwent coronary angiogram with a systematic <b>methylergometrine</b> intracoronary injection {{in the case of}} absence of significant coronary stenosis or spontaneous occlusive coronary spasm. Patients who had spontaneous occlusive coronary spasm or positive <b>methylergometrine</b> test, but no significant stenoses, were ultimately included in this study. ResultsAbout 581 patients had abnormal DSE, among them only 20 (3. 4 %) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There were 15 males and 5 females, and mean age was 64. 35 years (range 52 - 85); 8 patients had a known history of CAD and all of them had at least two established cardiovascular risk factors. The culprit vessel was the left anterior descending artery in 10 cases (50 %), right coronary artery in 8 cases (40 %), and left circumflex in 2 cases (10 %). There was a systematic correspondence between the culprit arteries and dobutamine-induced wall motion abnormality territories. No complications occurred during examination or during the provocation test. All the patients were discharged with a calcium channel blocker and were doing well after 13 months of mean follow-up.

40|$|BACKGROUND. In vitro {{studies have}} shown that the vasomotor {{response}} of internal mammary artery to vasoactive agents differs from that of saphenous vein. METHODS AND RESULTS. To assess whether the response in vivo to <b>methylergometrine</b> and to nitrates differs in saphenous vein grafts, internal mammary artery grafts, and coronary arteries, 25 patients were studied more than 6 months (range, 6 - 96 months) after surgery. Angiograms of saphenous vein grafts (n = 11) or mammary artery grafts (n = 14) were obtained in basal conditions, after intravenous infusion of 0. 4 mg <b>methylergometrine,</b> and after intragraft infusion of 1 mg isosorbide dinitrate. Computerized quantitative angiography was used to assess the changes in luminal diameter of the bypass graft and of the grafted coronary artery (n = 11). <b>Methylergometrine</b> reduced the diameter of saphenous vein grafts by 6. 9 +/- 7. 4 %, from 3. 26 +/- 0. 71 to 3. 05 +/- 0. 76 mm (p < 0. 01), and that of grafted coronary arteries by 9. 3 +/- 7. 2 % (NS compared with saphenous vein grafts), from 2. 08 +/- 0. 49 to 1. 89 +/- 0. 49 mm (p < 0. 005). The diameter of internal mammary artery grafts did not change significantly, from 3. 27 +/- 0. 42 to 3. 25 +/- 0. 44 mm (- 0. 3 +/- 5. 1 %, p < 0. 02 compared with saphenous vein grafts and p < 0. 002 compared with coronary arteries). After isosorbide dinitrate, the diameter of both grafted coronary arteries and mammary artery grafts increased significantly (respectively to 2. 46 +/- 0. 62 mm and 3. 44 +/- 0. 43 mm), the vasodilatation being greater (p < 0. 002) in coronary arteries (+ 17. 8 +/- 9. 8 % in proportion to basal diameter, p < 0. 001) than in mammary grafts (+ 5. 5 +/- 3. 3 %, p < 0. 001). The diameter of saphenous vein grafts returned to control values (3. 28 +/- 0. 70 mm, NS compared with basal); the changes in luminal diameter after nitrates (+ 0. 7 +/- 3. 1 %, NS) were significantly smaller than for mammary artery grafts (p < 0. 01) and for grafted coronary arteries (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS. Unlike internal mammary artery grafts, saphenous vein grafts constrict in response to <b>methylergometrine</b> and do not dilate in response to nitrates.

40|$|BACKGROUND: ECG changes, {{similar to}} those seen during {{myocardial}} ischaemia, together with symptoms of chest pain, are common during Caesarean section (CS). We hypothesized that oxytocin administration has cardiovascular effects leading to these symptoms and ECG changes. METHODS: Forty women undergoing elective CS under spinal anaesthesia were given an i. v. bolus of either 10 IU of oxytocin (Group OXY-CS, n= 20) or 0. 2 mg of <b>methylergometrine</b> (Group MET-CS, n= 20), in a double-blind, randomized fashion after delivery. Ten healthy, non-pregnant, non-anaesthetized women were used as normal controls (Group OXY-NC, n= 10) and were given 10 IU of oxytocin i. v. Twelve-lead ECG, on-line, computerized vectorcardiography (VCG), and invasive arterial pressure were recorded. RESULTS: Oxytocin produced {{a significant increase in}} heart rate, + 28 (SD 4) and + 52 (3) beats min(- 1) [mean (SEM); P< 0. 001], decreases in mean arterial pressure, - 33 (2) and - 30 (3) mm Hg (P< 0. 001), and increases in the spatial ST-change vector magnitude (STC-VM), + 77 (12) and + 114 (8) microV (P< 0. 001), in CS patients and controls, respectively. Symptoms of chest pain and subjective discomfort were simultaneously present. <b>Methylergometrine</b> produced mild hypertension and no significant ECG changes. CONCLUSIONS: Oxytocin administered as an i. v. bolus of 10 IU induces chest pain, transient profound tachycardia, hypotension, and concomitant signs of myocardial ischaemia according to marked ECG and STC-VM changes.

After <b>methylergometrine,</b> a constriction was observed in all gastroepiploic artery grafts (- 14 +/- 6 % of basal diameter) and in all but one grafted coronary artery (- 6 +/- 5 %). After isosorbide dinitrate, a dilation was consistently observed in all gastroepiploic artery grafts (+ 26 +/- 9 %) and grafted coronary arteries (+ 14 +/- 7 % of basal). Changes in lumen diameter in response to these constrictor and dilator stimuli, either expressed in absolute values or in percentage of control were significantly greater (P <. 001) in gastroepiploic artery grafts than in grafted coronary arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Gastroepiploic artery grafts implanted long-term are more reactive than grafted coronary arteries to ergometrine and nitrates. This response differs from that previously reported of internal mammary artery grafts to the same pharmacological vasoactive stimuli. This suggests that the concept of a more efficient endothelium-dependent control of vasomotor tone contributing to better long-term functional results of internal mammary artery grafts cannot be directly extrapolated to gastroepiploic artery grafts...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{derivatives}} of tryptamine and phenethylamine, and certain other compounds, were tested on neurones in the cerebral cortex of cats by iontophoretic release from micro-pipettes. The characteristic action {{of many of}} these compounds was a depression of the neuronal discharge initiated by synaptic activity or by the application of L-glutamate; imidazolylacetic acid, dopamine, ephedrine and ergometrine were particularly effective. Catechol amines, hydroxytryptamines and imidazolylacetic acid had a relatively quick and rapidly reversible action, not unlike that of γ-aminobutyric acid, whereas ephedrine and derivatives of lysergic acid diethylamide caused a slower and more prolonged depression of the amplitude of spikes, rather like atropine. Several compounds, including 5 -hydroxytryptamine, adrenaline and ergometrine, could also excite the same neurone when larger amounts were applied. A few substances, such as dopa and <b>methylergometrine,</b> had a predominantly excitant action...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectiveDobutamine stress {{echocardiography}} (DSE) {{is being}} consistently {{used as an}} exercise-independent stress modality aimed at the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) and the evaluation of myocardial ischemia. It may though occasionally induce coronary vasospasm. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of dobuta-mine-related coronary spasm in patients without known CAD and false positive DSE (positive DSE but no significant coronary lesions on angio-gram) Methods 3952 patients referred to our echocardiography laboratory for DSE between January 2010 and May 2012 were prospectively investigated. Those with positive DSE underwent coronary angiograms with systematic <b>methylergometrine</b> intracoronary injection in case of absence of significant coronary stenosis or spontaneous occlusive coronary spasm. Patients with spontaneous occlusive coronary spasm or positive <b>methylergometrine</b> test but no significant stenoses were enrolled and compared with those with positive DSE but no coronary lesions nor spontaneous or induced spasm (« true » false positive DSE) Results 29 patients with DSE-related vasospasm (19. 4 % of positive DSE without known CAD) were compared with 56 patients with no lesions and no spam (« true » false positive DSE). They were more frequently smokers (72. 4 % vs 37. 5 %; p= 0. 003); they had more frequently dyslipidemia (79. 3 % vs 43 %;p= 0. 001); they also had a larger ischemic area at peak DSE (3. 4 vs 2. 7 segments; p= 0. 05). On multivariate analysis, dyslipidemia (HR= 10. 7; 95 % CI= [2. 7 - 42. 1]; p= 0. 001) and active smoking (HR= 6. 1; 95 % CI= [1. 7 - 21. 1]; p= 0. 004) {{were found to be}} independant predictors of spam-related DSE rather than « true » false positive DSE. ConclusionDSE- related coronary spasm is present in a significant proportion of patients with erroneously labelled « false » positive DSE and should systematically be ruled out. Dyslipidemia and active smoking were independant predictors of spasm rather than « true » false positive DS...|$|E
