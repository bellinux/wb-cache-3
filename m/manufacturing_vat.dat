40|$|Variable Angle Tow (VAT) {{laminates}} {{that generally}} exhibit variable stiffness properties not only provide extended design freedom, but also offer beneficial stress distributions. In this paper, {{the prospect of}} VAT composite panels with significantly reduced loss of in-plane compressive stiffness in the postbuckled state in comparison with conventional structures, is studied. Specifically, we identify that both thickness and local fiber angle variation are required to effectively define “buckle-free” panels under compression loading. In this work, the postbuckling behaviour of variable thickness VAT composite panels is analyzed using an efficient and robust semi-analytical approach. Most previous works on the postbuckling of VAT panels assume constant thickness. The additional benefits of tailoring thickness variation {{in the design of}} VAT composite panels are seldom studied. However, in the process of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>VAT</b> laminates, either by using the conventional Advanced fiber Placement (AFP) machine (tow overlap) or the newly developed Continuous Tow Shearing (CTS) process (tow shrink) thickness build-up is inevitable. The postbuckling optimization for the design of VAT layups is conducted by a two-level framework using lamination parameters as intermediate design variables. The objective is to determine optimal lamination parameters and thickness distributions for maximizing the axial compressive stiffness of VAT laminates that are loaded in the postbuckling regime. The thickness variation due to both manufacturing of VAT laminates and for where it is independent of manufacturing process are considered. In accordance with the first-level optimal postbuckling solutions in terms of lamination parameters, we investigate a practical “buckle-free” VAT panel using a blended layup configuration. This blended VAT panel consists of a piecewise combination of segmental CTS layers and constant-thickness VAT layers. The prospect of taking advantage of a benign combination of stiffness and thickness to improve the overall compressive strength of VAT panels is studied. Finally, the optimal results are analysed to provide insight into the manufacturing of VAT laminates using either the AFP or the CTS process for improved postbuckling stiffness under compression loading...|$|E

5000|$|Development of {{the island}} has come under intense {{scrutiny}} after the government chose Batu Kawan as the mainland site for a major industrial area and the third satellite town of George Town, Penang after Bayan Lepas and Seberang Jaya. New industrial sites, commercial areas and residential schemes {{are expected to be}} developed in Batu Kawan town. Besides that, Batu Kawan is heading towards a bustling industrial hub just like the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Park and the Prai Industrial Area. Three big companies — Robert Bosch, Boon Siew Honda and <b>VAT</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> Malaysia — have pledged investments totalling about RM10bil to site their manufacturing plants in this town.|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{activities}} of production planning and scheduling is integrated production management. In particular, discrete or partially complex production {{has an impact on}} many problems otherwise difficult to solve without using an adequate software support tool. Programming advanced planning algorithms lends a broad accent to optimally utilizing manufacturing resources and capacities, resulting in a reduction in production lead times and manufacturing cost savings (e. g. reduced need for overtime and cooperation, eliminating the failure to meet delivery deadlines, etc.). Rigid manufacturing systems (mostly push systems) already prove useless and insufficient for most production companies. Due to rapidly changing market conditions, dynamic adjustment of production plans is becoming extremely important. Implementing a new information system in the area of production planning and scheduling is not always to the benefit of a company. Therefore, it is necessary to know how to measure the benefits of these applications in relation to the performance of a production process. Defining efficiency evaluation indicators for software implemented (not just in the manufacturing process) is often a complicated procedure. The biggest obstacle is the inability to clearly define the benefits of the solution put in place and to separate out issues influenced by any other innovations and improvements of a production process. As regards evaluating an information system implementation, it is necessary to look at changes in actual production control and production planning processes as a whole. A good consultant or a systems integrator not only sets up software, they also adopt the role of a good teacher - one that helps establish know-how in a company on a selected application area or aids the introduction of best practices from other similar projects. The success of system implementation is dependent on many factors. One of the most important of these, in relation to advanced planning and scheduling applications, is the form of production according to differentiation of various types. This paper also discusses basic dependencies between selected planning algorithms and classification as regards the continuity of a <b>manufacturing</b> process and <b>VAT</b> analysis...|$|R
