In this paper, we study the effect of homogenization on the proof complexity of refutations of polynomials derived from Boolean formulas in both the Polynomial Calculus (PC) and Nullstellensatz systems. We show that the PC refutations of homogenized formulas give crucial information about {{the complexity of the}} original formulas. The <b>minimum</b> <b>PC</b> refutation degree of homogenized formulas is equal to the Nullstellensatz refutation degree of the original formulas, whereas the size of the homogenized PC refutation is equal {{to the size of the}} PC refutation for the originals. Using this relationship, we prove nearly linear (Ω ¡ n ¢ logn £ vs. O ¡ 1 £) separations between Nullstellensatz and PC degree, for a family explicitly constructed contradictory 3 CNF formulas. Previously, a Ω ¡ n 1 ¤ 2 £ separation had been proved for equations that did not correspond to any CNF formulas, and a logn separation for equations derived from kCNF formulas...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{presented}} the general formulation of light reflection using {{a series of}} 1 D PCs with different periods, made of non-absorptive materials of any refractive indices. In {{order to have a}} large bandgap – the spectral range of reflection, the periods of 1 D PCs must be distributed in a geometrical progression with a common ratio, r, smaller than a maximum value of rc. The paper have presented exact expressions for rc, bandgap to mid gap ratio of the PC hetero-structure, and the <b>minimum</b> number of <b>PCs</b> to achieve the desired range of bandgap in single and all angles of incidence. The proposed method can be used to design filters for vast range of applications such as UV filters (i. e., sunglasses, eye safety glasses, UV photography filters) and visible light filters...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} sample of 14 OB stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud that meet strong {{criteria}} for having formed under extremely sparse star-forming conditions in the field. These stars are a <b>minimum</b> of 28 <b>pc</b> in projection from other OB stars, and they are centered within symmetric, round HII regions. They show no evidence of bow shocks, implying that the targets are not transverse runaway stars. Their radial velocities relative to local HI also indicate {{that they are not}} line-of-sight runaway stars. A friends-of-friends analysis shows that 9 of the objects present a few low-mass companion stars, with typical mass ratios for the two highest-mass stars of around 0. 1. This further substantiates that these OB stars formed in place, and that they can and do form in extremely sparse conditions. This poses strong constraints on theories of star formation and challenges proposed relations between cluster mass and maximum stellar mass. Comment: Accepted to ApJ, 12 page...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of technologies employed at the agricultural production system such as crop rotation and soil preparation, both associated with crop-livestock integration, is crucial. Therefore, {{the aim of}} the present study was to evaluate the incorporation of lime for three no-tillage systems and cultural managements in system of crop-livestock integration, with emphasis on corn grain yield. The experiment was conducted from January 2003 to April 2005 at Selvíria city, MS, in Dystroferric Red Latosol, clay texture. The experimental design was randomized blocks with split plots consisted of three main treatments, aimed the soil physics conditioning and the incorporation of lime: PD - No-no-tillage; CM - <b>minimum</b> no-tillage, and <b>PC</b> - conventional no-tillage; and of two secondary treatments related to the management: rotation and crop succession, with four replications. Data on agronomic traits of maize were analyzed: plant height, stem diameter, height of the first spike insertion, 100 grains weight and grain yield. The results showed that the maize produced under the system of crop-livestock integration is quite feasible, showing that grain yields are comparable to averages in the region and the different soil physical conditioning and incorporation of lime did not influence the corn yield as well as the cultural managements, rotation and succession, did not affect the maize crop behavior after two years of cultivation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Numerous {{studies have}} {{reported}} on the immunophenotype of plasma cells (PCs) in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and in plasma cell myeloma (PCM), but very few have examined the immunophenotype of normal PCs. In this study, an objective definition of normal range of expression for each antigen was found on normal control PCs. Using these new ranges of normal expression (new method) is different from using a static 20 % of PCs cut-off for all antigens {{as described in the}} literature (traditional method). These newly calculated normal ranges for each antigen were applied to our data, and compared to histologic and immunohistochemical findings. METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 46 patients with PC neoplasms and 15 normal controls were studied. A <b>minimum</b> of 100 <b>PC</b> were analyzed for each patient and control sample. An 8 -color staining method was applied to study the immunophenotype of PCs, using a BD FACSCanto II. RESULTS: By the new ranges of normality calculated in this study it was determined that different antigens have different level of expression on polyclonal PCs. CD 19 correlated with histology by both the traditional and new methods, but had superior correlation by the new method. CONCLUSIONS: This report is the first 8 -color immunophenotypic study of PCM in which a "range of normal expression" for each antigen is defined. This is a critical step to help distinguish between a normal and neoplastic PC immunophenotype and discern which antigens are of diagnostic importance...|$|R
40|$|We use {{high-resolution}} {{simulations of}} isolated dwarf galaxies {{to study the}} physics of dark matter cusp-core transformations {{at the edge of}} galaxy formation: M 200 = 107 - 109 M⊙. We work at a resolution (~ 4 <b>pc</b> <b>minimum</b> cell size; ~ 250 M⊙ per particle) at which the impact from individual supernovae explosions can be resolved, becoming insensitive to even large changes in our numerical 'sub-grid' parameters. We find that our dwarf galaxies give a remarkable match to the stellar light profile; star formation history; metallicity distribution function; and star/gas kinematics of isolated dwarf irregular galaxies. Our key result is that dark matter cores of size comparable to the stellar half-mass radius r 1 / 2 always form if star formation proceeds for long enough. Cores fully form in less than 4 Gyr for the M 200 = 108 M⊙ and ~ 14 Gyr for the 109 M⊙ dwarf. We provide a convenient two parameter 'coreNFW' fitting function that captures this dark matter core growth as a function of star formation time and the projected stellar half-mass radius. Our results have several implications: (i) we make a strong prediction that if Λcold dark matter is correct, then 'pristine' dark matter cusps will be found either in systems that have truncated star formation and/or at radii r > r 1 / 2; (ii) complete core formation lowers the projected velocity dispersion at r 1 / 2 by a factor of ~ 2, which is sufficient to fully explain the 'too-big-to-fail problem'; and (iii) cored dwarfs will be much more susceptible to tides, leading to a dramatic scouring of the sub-halo mass function inside galaxies and groups...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{high-resolution}} 5 -GHz radio continuum {{map of the}} starburst galaxy NGC 2146 made with MERLIN and the VLA, in a search of radio supernovae and supernova remnants expected to be already produced by the most massive stars in the starburst. At 5 GHz, about 20 point sources were detected earlier by Glendenning & Kronberg (1986) in the central 800 pc of NGC 2146. Our observations with higher sensitivity and resolution made with MERLIN and the VLA confirms the detection of 18 sources, and resolves 7 of them. Additional 1. 6 -GHz MERLIN observations disclose 9 sources coincident in position with those detected at 5 GHz, which allows us to derive their spectral indices. Only 3 sources have indices consistent with synchrotron emission from supernova remnants or radio supernovae, while the others have very steep inverted spectra. We suggest that the sources with positive spectral index are optically thick ultra-compact and/or ultra-dense HII regions with high electron densities and high emission measures (EM > 10 ^(7) cm^(- 6) <b>pc).</b> <b>Minimum</b> energy requirements indicate that these regions may contain up to 1000 equivalent stars of type O 6. When compared with M 82, the galaxy NGC 2146 lacks however {{a large number of}} supernova remnants. We suggest that NGC 2146 is experiencing a burst of star formation stronger than that in M 82, but being in a younger phase. We may, however, not exclude an alternative scenario in which strong free-free absorption at 1. 6 GHz in foreground ionized gas with very high emission measures (EM > 10 ^(8) cm^(- 6) pc) hides a certain number of supernova remnants, thus rendering for some sources the observed inverted spectra.

40|$|We {{estimate}} the density {{laws of the}} Galactic stellar populations {{as a function of}} absolute magnitude in a near-polar Galactic field. The density laws are determined by the direct fit to photometric parallaxes from Vega photometry in the ELAIS (l= 84. 27, b=+ 44. 90; 6. 571 deg^ 2) field both independently for each population and simultaneously for all stellar populations. Stars have been separated into different populations based on their spatial location. The thick disc and halo best fit by an exponential. However, the thin disc best fits by using a sech^ 2 law for stars at faint absolute magnitudes, (10, 11], (11, 12] and (12, 13], whereas an exponential law for stars at relatively bright absolute magnitudes, (5, 6], (6, 7], (7, 8], (8, 9] and (9, 10]. The scaleheights for the sech^ 2 density laws are the equivalent exponential scaleheights. Galactic model parameters are absolute magnitude dependent: The scaleheight for thin disc decreases monotonically from stars at bright absolute magnitudes to stars at faint absolute magnitudes in the range 363 - 163 <b>pc,</b> except the <b>minimum</b> H= 211 <b>pc</b> at (9, 10] where sech density law fits better. Its local density is flat at bright absolute magnitudes but it increases at faint absolute magnitudes. For thick disc, the scaleheight is flat within the uncertainties. The local space density of thick disc relative to the local space density for the thin disc is almost flat at absolute magnitude intervals (5, 6] and (6, 7], 7. 59 and 7. 41 % respectively, whereas it decreases down to 3. 31 % at absolute magnitude interval (7, 8]. The axial ratio for the halo is e= 0. 60, 0. 73 and 0. 78 for the absolute magnitude intervals (4, 5], (5, 6] and (6, 7] respectively, and its local space density relative to the local space density for the thin disc is 0. 06 and 0. 04 % for the intervals (5, 6], and (6, 7] respectively.

40|$|New {{observations}} of the star formation region NGC 7538 are presented. Energetic outflows are commonly associated with regions of active star formation, {{despite the fact that}} the star formation process itself must be predominantly one of infall. This work shows how multi-wavelength observations can be used to study such phenomena on a variety of scales, in an attempt to infer their connection with star formation processes. Included are near-infrared spectroscopy of IRS 2; carbon monoxide J = 1 - 0 emission line mapping of the central regions of the NGC 7538 molecular cloud; and high spatial resolution maps of IRS 1 at 5 and 15 GHz. Other recent observational data are also considered, including far-infrared continua mapping, maser sources, and spectroscopy of numerous atomic and molecular species. A very large (r ≥ 1. 5 pc) and massive (m ≥ 100 solar masses) distribution of high velocity (ΔV(FWHM) ≃ 35 - 40 km s⁻¹) molecular gas is identified in NGC 7538. The correspondence of far-infrared emission with the extent of the high velocity gas, along with the near-equality between the observed momentum flux of the gas and that which is available for radiation pressure L(*) /c (IRS 1 - 3) leads to the proposal of an in situ mechanism for radiative acceleration of the gas. This mechanism for radiative acceleration of the gas. This mechanism operates in cases where the optical depth of dust is insufficient to permit the "snowplow" outflow effect from strong radiation pressure. On the 1 / 2 - 1 <b>pc</b> <b>minimum</b> scale of these molecular observations, no obvious bipolarity or collimation is detected, consistent with the in situ mechanism. The highly luminous infrared source IRS 1 is identified as the probable source of this high velocity phenomenon. It is the most luminous source of the three (IRS 1 - 3) upon which the high velocity gas distribution is centered. The presence on a scale of 100 - 100 AU of a high density ridge perpendicular to a collimated distribution of ionized gas is strongly indicated in both mid-infrared and radio emission, and by anomalous optical and infrared extinctions. There is thus a startling discontinuity between collimation of gas on this scale and the lack of it observed at the arcminute scale of the molecular observations...|$|R
40|$|Plants are {{essential}} {{for the existence of}} most living things on this planet. Plants are used for providing food, shelter, and medicine. The ability to identify plants is very important for several applications, including conservation of endangered plant species, rehabilitation of lands after mining activities and differentiating crop plants from weeds. In recent times, many researchers have made attempts to develop automated plant species recognition systems. However, the current computer-based plants recognition systems have limitations as some plants are naturally complex, thus it is difficult to extract and represent their features. Further, natural differences of features within the same plant and similarities between plants of different species cause problems in classification. This thesis developed a novel hybrid intelligent system based on a neuro-genetic model for automatic recognition of plants using leaf image analysis based on novel approach of combining several image descriptors with Cellular Neural Networks (CNN), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN) to address classification challenges in plant computer-based plant species identification using the images of plant leaves. A GA-based feature selection module was developed to select the best of these leaf features. Particle Swam Optimization (PSO) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were also used sideways for comparison and to provide rigorous feature selection and analysis. Statistical analysis using ANOVA and correlation techniques confirmed the effectiveness of the GA-based and PSO-based techniques as there were no redundant features, since the subset of features selected by both techniques correlated well. The number of principal components (PC) from the past were selected by conventional method associated with PCA. However, in this study, GA was used to select a <b>minimum</b> number of <b>PC</b> from the original PC space. This reduced computational cost with respect to time and increased the accuracy of the classifier used. The algebraic nature of the GA’s fitness function ensures good performance of the GA. Furthermore, GA was also used to optimize the parameters of a CNN (CNN for image segmentation) and then uniquely combined with PNN to improve and stabilize the performance of the classification system. The CNN (being an ordinary differential equation (ODE)) was solved using Runge-Kutta 4 th order algorithm in order to minimize descritisation errors associated with edge detection. This study involved the extraction of 112 features from the images of plant species found in the Flavia dataset (publically available) using MATLAB programming environment. These features include Zernike Moments (20 ZMs), Fourier Descriptors (21 FDs), Legendre Moments (20 LMs), Hu 7 Moments (7 Hu 7 Ms), Texture Properties (22 TP), Geometrical Properties (10 GP), and Colour features (12 CF). With the use of GA, only 14 features were finally selected for optimal accuracy. The PNN was genetically optimized to ensure optimal accuracy since it is not the best practise to fix the tunning parameters for the PNN arbitrarily. Two separate GA algorithms were implemented to optimize the PNN, that is, the GA provided by MATLAB Optimization Toolbox (GA 1) and a separately implemented GA (GA 2). The best chromosome (PNN spread) for GA 1 was 0. 035 with associated classification accuracy of 91. 3740 % while a spread value of 0. 06 was obtained from GA 2 giving rise to improved classification accuracy of 92. 62 %. The PNN-based classifier used in this study was benchmarked against other classifiers such as Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), K Nearest Neigbhour (kNN), Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC), Radial Basis Function (RBF), Ensemble classifiers (Adaboost). The best candidate among these classifiers was the genetically optimized PNN. Some computational theoretic properties on PNN are also presented...|$|R
