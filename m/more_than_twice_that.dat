5|$|One {{point of}} {{concern has been}} the {{standard}} of radiation emission from 10,000 years to 1,000,000 years into the future. On August 9, 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed a limit of 350millirem per year for that period. In October 2007, the DOE issued {{a draft of the}} Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement in which it shows that for the first 10,000years mean public dose would be 0.24mrem/year and that thereafter to 1,000,000 years the median public dose would be 0.98mrem/year, both of which are substantially below the proposed EPA limit. For comparison, a hip x-ray results in a dose around 83 mrem and a CT head or chest scan results in around 1,110 mrem. Annually, in the United States, an individual's doses from background radiation is about 350 mrem, although some places get <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
5|$|Titanium has the {{inherent}} ability to osseointegrate, enabling use in dental implants that {{can last for}} over 30 years. This property is also useful for orthopedic implant applications. These benefit from titanium's lower modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus) to more closely match that of the bone that such devices are intended to repair. As a result, skeletal loads are more evenly shared between bone and implant, leading to a lower incidence of bone degradation due to stress shielding and periprosthetic bone fractures, which occur at the boundaries of orthopedic implants. However, titanium alloys' stiffness is still <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> of bone, so adjacent bone bears a greatly reduced load and may deteriorate.|$|E
5|$|A {{haplotype}} is a {{group of}} genes found in an organism that are inherited together from one of their parents. A haplogroup {{is a group}} of similar haplotypes that share a single mutation inherited from their common ancestor. Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) passes along the maternal line and can date back thousands of years. A 2005 study compared the mitochondrial DNA sequences of modern wolves with those from thirty-four specimens dated between 1856 and 1915. The historic population was found to possess twice the genetic diversity of modern wolves, which suggests that the mDNA diversity of the wolves eradicated from the western US was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> of the modern population. A 2007 study compared mDNA sequences of modern wolves with those from Beringian wolves. The twenty Beringian wolves yielded sixteen haplotypes that could not be found in modern wolves, compared with seven haplotypes that were found in thirty-two modern Alaskan and Yukon wolves. This finding indicates that Beringian wolves were genetically distinct from modern wolves and possessed greater genetic diversity, and that there once existed in North America a larger wolf population than today.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, 40 years after the Qing reconquest of the area, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in {{northern}} Xinjiang and somewhat <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> number of Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang. A census of Xinjiang under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30% Han and 60% Turkic, while it dramatically shifted to 6% Han and 75% Uyghur in the 1953 census, however by 2000 the recorded population was 40.57% Han and 45.21% Uyghur. Professor Stanley W. Toops noted that today's demographic situation {{is similar to that of}} the early Qing period in Xinjiang. In northern Xinjiang, the Qing brought in Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, and Kazakh colonists after they exterminated the Zunghar Oirat Mongols in the region, with one third of Xinjiang's total population consisting of Hui and Han in the north, while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin.|$|E

Pathan was featured on the headlines when he claimed 9/16 against Bangladesh, helping to bowl them out for 34, and helped India to emerge victorious over Sri Lanka in the final, taking 3/33. Pathan also scored 94 runs at 31.33 with the bat, compiling scores of 32, 28 and 34. Pathan returned to India and took 3/51 and 1/33 and scored 26 and 12 in his first Ranji Trophy match for the season, against Andhra Pradesh.

The catalysts improved toluene destruction by catalytic decomposition of O 3 and generation of O.
