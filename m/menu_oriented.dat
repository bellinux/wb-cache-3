40|$|The Motorola Exorset 30 system, {{based on}} a Motorola 6809 {{microprocessor}} which serves as control processor for the microdensitometer is presented. User communication and instrument control are implemented in this syatem; data transmission to a host computer is provided via standard interfaces. The Vienna PDS system (VIPS) software was developed in BASIC and M 6809 assembler. It provides efficient user interaction via function keys and argument input in a <b>menu</b> <b>oriented</b> environment. All parameters can be stored on, and retrieved from, minifloppy disks, {{making it possible to}} set up large scanning tasks. Extensive user information includes continuously updated status and coordinate displays, as well as a real time graphic display during scanning...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliography. A {{two-dimensional}} generator {{is described}} which automatically creates optimal finite element meshes using the Delaunay triangulation algorithm. The mesh generator is adaptive {{in the sense}} that elements containing the largest normalized errors are automatically refined, providing meshes with a uniform error density. The system runs on a PERQ computer made by Three Rivers Computer Company. It is <b>menu</b> <b>oriented</b> and utilizes multiple command and display windows to create and edit the object description interactively. Mesh generation from the object data base is automatic, although it may be modified interactively by the user if desired. Application of the mesh generator to electric machine design and to magnetic bubble simulation shows it {{to be one of the}} most powerful and easy to use systems yet devise...|$|E

IBM PCIA T'S parallel printer port has been used to interface with the motor's power driver circuit which is specially designedfor this project. Controlled data such as the motor's speed, the direction of rotation, the current step number, the total steps number, the status of the motor as well as the speed indicator and the motor stepping simulation will be displayed on the scree...|$|E
40|$|A {{software}} management system, originally developed for Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) by Century Computing, Inc. {{has evolved from}} a <b>menu</b> and command <b>oriented</b> system to a state-of-the art user interface development system supporting high resolution graphics workstations. Transportable Applications Environment (TAE) was initially distributed through COSMIC and backed by a TAE support office at GSFC. In 1993, Century Computing assumed the support and distribution functions and began marketing TAE Plus, the system's latest version. The software is {{easy to use and}} does not require programming experience...|$|R
40|$|The system MiND (Multipurpose {{integrated}} Neural Device) is {{a development}} system for neuro-fuzzy applications. It includes a new neuroprocessor for accelerating networks like Backpropagation, Radial-Basis-Function or Kohonen networks (up to 800 MCPS). The user interface of MiND is <b>menu</b> and graphic <b>oriented.</b> The system is supplied with many "predefined" simulators. However, {{based on the}} specification language CONNECT and on given C++ graphic and menu classes a user easily can adapt predefined simulators or develop own ones. The flexibility and extendability of the system specifically supports the development of custom applications...|$|R
50|$|The main user {{interfaces}} to MVS are: Job Control Language (JCL), which was originally designed for batch processing {{but from the}} 1970s onwards was also used to start and allocate resources to long-running interactive jobs such CICS; and TSO (Time Sharing Option), the interactive time-sharing interface, which was mainly used to run development tools and a few end-user information systems. ISPF is a TSO application for users on 3270-family terminals (and later, on VM as well), which allows the user to accomplish the same tasks as TSO's command line but in a <b>menu</b> and form <b>oriented</b> manner, and with a full screen editor and file browser. TSO's basic interface is command line, although facilities were added later for form-driven interfaces).|$|R
40|$|The growing {{widespread}} use of data communication networks has led to increased reliance {{on the availability of}} network resources. The network itself is a critical resource which must be managed in a timely and effective manner. In order to manage the network effectively, the network manager must have powerful tools that present network information in a fast and logical way. The work presented here is the design and development of a network management tool for Sytek broadband networks. The Sytek Network Management Package (SNMP) incorporates a commercial database management system, Rbase System V, and <b>menu</b> <b>oriented</b> management functions for the University of Arizona Sytek broadband networks. The SNMP is written in C and executes on a PC connected to the Sytek network. The SNMP allows a network manager to manage both the Sytek LocalNet 20 and System 2000 networks...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to show a {{software}} package, based in Matlab, that simplifies the process of designing analog filters [1, 2]. This package is <b>menu</b> <b>oriented</b> using the Matlab capabilities for doing so. The package is able to design lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and bandreject filters. The approximation magnitude responses can be Butterworth (maximally flat magnitude), Chebyshev (equal-ripple), Inverse Chebyshev, and Elliptic ones. In the case of phase response we have the Thomson one (maximally flat delay) also known as Bessel response. The output for the approximation satge {{is a set of}} data that includes the transfer function poles and zeros, quadratic factors for both numerator and denominator polynomials, and the numerator and denominator polynomials. The network realizations can be either passive or active realizations. For the passive realizations we have the low sensitivity ladder realization. This realization is available for any approximation type. In the case of the active realizations we have implemented the cascade of biquad stages but we are working in the active ladder realization. For the biquad stages available we have the Sallen-Key realization, multiple feedback, state-variable KHN, state variable Tow-Thomas, and the GIC based biquad...|$|E
2500|$|Lüchow's <b>menu</b> was German <b>oriented</b> {{throughout}} its existence, with dishes including Wiener Schnitzel and various wild game. [...] "Knackwurst and Sauerkraut", Bratwurst, red cabbage and beets, Sauerbraten and pumpernickel bread were perennial staples. Pfannkuchen mit Preiselbeeren, (flambéed thin pancakes with lingonberry sauce) and Sachertorte, a recipe {{borrowed from the}} famous Sacher Hotel in Vienna, were favorites of the dessert selection. Apparently the German orientation was relaxed somewhat {{in the years after}} 1923 when August Lüchow died, putting the restaurant under control of his sister's husband Victor Eckstein. Even during Lüchow's lifetime it was necessary to make compromises: during the First World War anti-German sentiment ran so high that by 1917 he thought it prudent to remove the umlaut over the [...] "u" [...] of Lüchow's in all public occurrences of the name.|$|R
40|$|The system MiND (Multipurpose {{integrated}} Neural Device) is {{a development}} system for artificial neural networks. It includes a neuroboard {{based on the}} new neuroprocessor SAND (Simple Applicable Neural Device), {{which can be used}} to accelerate networks like Backpropagation, Radial-Basis-Function or Kohonen networks (up to 800 MCPS). The user interface of MiND is <b>menu</b> and graphic <b>oriented.</b> The system is supplied with many "predefined" simulators. However, based on the specification language CONNECT and on abstract C++ graphic and menu classes a user can easily adapt predefined simulators or develop own ones. The language CONNECT is based on a generic connectionist model. It allows to specify connectionist systems in an abstract and, at the same time, complete way. I. e., all relevant aspects (e. g. learning algorithms) are given explicitely, but in a compact and readable way. A CONNECT specification is translated into a C++ network class and then can easily be glued together with the graphic [...] ...|$|R
40|$|According to the Constitution and the {{existing}} laws, the Parliament plays a fundamental {{role in the}} Romanian political system. But public con fi dence in Parliament has declined to a minimum 10 % in 2012 mostly because of the prolonged and deep economic crisis. We have used the elites theory to explain the constant low levels of con fi dence recorded by this institution since the anti-communist revolution. The winning parties of the 1990 s gained access to power {{for a long time and}} established performance standards for future parliamentarians and also in fl uenced people’s long-term expectations from the political elites. The old communist elites chose a <b>menu</b> of changes <b>oriented</b> towards securing their survival in a new political and social system. Through free elections, the old elite originated a new political power, sending in Parliament an important number of people who used to hold key positions in the communist regime. Thus, old values and habitus have been perpetuated. We show, by using elites theory, that the „genetic” pro fi le of the Parliament continues to be in fl uenced by the founding elite’s old values, which are incompatible with ideas such as freedom, competition, and rule of law. The electoral system was changed in 2008, but that has not managed to change the old values yet.   </div...|$|R
