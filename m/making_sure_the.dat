5|$|Super Mario 3D Land was {{designed}} {{to bridge the gap}} between 2D Mario games and 3D Mario games, and influenced by Miyamoto's philosophy of keeping the games fun in nature and <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> player had the utmost opportunity to enjoy the experience of the game. A main concern during development was making a game that would appeal to fans of the 2D Super Mario games as well as the 3D games; levels were designed so that the player would not get lost, moving Mario in one general direction towards each level's goal.|$|E
5|$|During that era, {{hospital}} {{nurses and}} midwives were {{trained on the}} job. Schwester Selma trained and supervised all the nurses, operating-room nurses, and midwives in the hospital, teaching the former {{how to make a}} hospital bed and the latter how to diaper newborns and swaddle infants. Sometimes she also substituted for the midwives, who did not live on the premises. For many years, Schwester Selma was Dr. Wallach's right-hand assistant in the areas of uterine curettages, tracheotomies, and ritual circumcisions, accompanied him on house calls, and stood in for him as hospital director when he was away.

25|$|Being a koryū, an {{old school}} with a {{traditional}} way of teaching, SMR relies on verbal instructions (as opposed to the detailed manuals of the more modern era) in order to teach {{the large majority of}} the practical applications in the art. The teacher-student relationship is very important to koryu-arts. The training forms (kata) alone do not (and cannot for practical reasons) reveal all the large number of practical applications and variations of the techniques. This can only be done properly by an experienced teacher who spends many years passing on the teachings to the student in person. Many koryū arts have deliberately hidden some, or all, applications inside their training forms, making them invisible unless properly explained by a teacher knowledgeable in the art. This was done as a way of <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> secrets and principles could not be copied by rival schools or individuals, should an outsider accidentally (or by deliberate spying) observe the techniques in action.|$|E
25|$|Production of {{an average}} episode of MST3K during the Comedy Central period took about five to nine days once the movie was {{selected}} and its rights secured. The first few days were generally used for watching the film and scripting out the riffs and live action segments. The subsequent days were then generally used to start construction of any props or sets that would be needed for the live action segments while the writers honed the script. A full dress rehearsal would then be held, <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> segments and props worked and fine tuning the script. The host segments would then be filmed on one day, and the theater segments on the next. A final day was used to review the completed work and correct any major flaws they caught before considering the episode complete. Live scenes used only practical special effects, and there was minimal post-editing once filming was completed.|$|E

To make matters worse for them Louis was not willing to commit more men and ships to the Caribbean. An English attempt to retake St. Kitts ended in failure but it would not matter as more English reinforcements arrived under Rear-Admiral Sir John Harman.

25|$|In the ebook The Third Law, Rico Dredd as narrator {{tells the}} reader {{that he was trying}} to enforce the law in a less remote fashion, {{allowing}} for mercy and accepting the citizens as they were; bribes are explained as a way of <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> crime lords believed they controlled him and he wasn't the one ensuring they kept restrained. Sex and drinking are shrugged off as perks, and threats to Joe as being the result of drinking. Rico is implied to be an unreliable narrator and this calls his claims into question. Notably, he claims he couldn't shoot Kenner in case the bullets were traced and he used the rad pit to kill him, and regretted 'having' to kill him; the original strip shows him hitting Kenner with an incendary round, shooting his limbs, and mocking him as he dies, using the rad pit to dispose of the corpse. The ebook Wear Iron is told in third-person and describes Rico's thoughts circa 2080: here, when he isn't telling his own story, he's callous, brutal, and sometimes bursts out in manic laughter. He remembers Kenner's murder fondly.|$|E
25|$|During the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, the Druze in Mandatory Palestine {{were under}} {{pressure}} from both the Jewish Yishuv leadership and from the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee and {{found it difficult to}} form an opinion about the conflict between the Jews and the Palestinian Arabs. Noble Druze men from nearby countries visited Druze villages in Palestine and preached neutrality. During {{the early days of the}} conflict, a meeting of all the noblemen from all the Druze villages was conducted in Daliyat al-Karmel, where they all agreed not to take part in the riots instigated by the Arab Higher Committee. This decision was backed by Druze leaders in Jabal al-Druze. In the Druze community there were opposing trends: In mixed Druze and Muslim villages such as Isfiya, Shefa-'Amr and Maghar where there were old sectarial disputes and in Druze villages near Haifa and the Jewish settlement in the western Galilee, the local Druze leaders tended to prefer the Jews in the conflict; at the Druze villages deep in Arab areas, the local leaders were more careful with support of the Jews.
