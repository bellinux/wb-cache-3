40|$|Either {{electric}} or {{magnetic field}} {{can be employed}} for micro actuation. Each type of actuation principle has its own advantages and drawbacks. This paper presents a comparative study of micro actuators driven by electric and magnetic principles. It is shown that the electrostatic and piezoelectric actuators have good scaling effects whereas the electromagnetic actuators have higher power density. Moreover, the piezoelectric actuators have the highest force/torque density. As a case study, a comparison between an axial-flux type <b>magnetic</b> <b>micromotor</b> and a travelling wave ultrasonic type is also presented. 1...|$|E
40|$|LIGA is a {{procession}} sequence which uses x-ray lithography on photoresist layers {{of several hundred}} micrometers to produce very high edge acuity photopolymer molds. These plastic molds {{can be converted to}} metal molds via electroplating of many different metals and alloys. The end results are high edge acuity metal parts with large structural heights. The LIGA process as originally described by W. Ehrfeld can be extended by adding a surface micromachining phase to produce precision metal parts which can be assembled to form three-dimensional micromechanisms. This process, SLIGA, has been used to fabricate a dynamometer on a chip. The instrument has been fully implemented and will be applied to tribology issues, speed-torque characterization of planar <b>magnetic</b> <b>micromotors</b> and a new family of sensors...|$|R
40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) are ubiquitous {{in the environment}} {{as a result of}} modern industrial processes. We present an effective POPs decontamination strategy based on their dynamic adsorption at the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) -coated silica (SiO) -Pt Janus <b>magnetic</b> <b>micromotors</b> for their appropriate final disposition. While the motors rapidly move in a contaminated solution, the adsorption of POPs efficiently takes place in a very short time. Characterization of the micromotors both from the materials and from the motion point of view was performed. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 5 -chloro- 2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) phenol (triclosan) were chosen as model POPs and the removal of the contaminants was efficiently achieved. The rGO-coated micromotors demonstrated superior adsorbent properties with respect to their concomitant GO-coated micromotors, static rGO-coated particles and dynamic silica micromotors counterparts. The extent of decontamination was studied over the number of <b>micromotors,</b> whose <b>magnetic</b> properties were used for their collection from environmental samples. The adsorption properties were maintained for 4 cycles of micromotors reuse. The new rGO-coated SiO functional material-based micromotors showed outstanding capabilities towards the removal of POPs and their further disposition, opening up new possibilities for efficient environmental remediation of these hazardous compounds.

40|$|Deep x-ray {{lithography}} and electroplating {{may be combined}} to form a fabrication tool for micromechanical devices with large structural heights, to 500 micron, and extreme edge acuities, less than 0. 1 micron-run-out per 100 micron of height. This process concept which originated in Germany as LIGA may be further extended by adding surface micromachining. This extension permits the fabrication of precision metal and plastic parts which may be assembled into three-dimensional micromechanical components and systems. The processing tool {{may be used to}} fabricate devices from ferromagnetic material such as nickel and nickel-iron alloys. These materials when properly heat treated exhibit acceptable magnetic behavior for current to flux conversion and marginal behavior for permanent magnet applications. The tool and materials have been tested via planar, <b>magnetic,</b> rotational <b>micromotor</b> fabrication. Three phase reluctance machines of the 6 : 4 configuration with 280 micron diameter rotors have been tested and analyzed. Stable rotational speeds to 34, 000 rpm with output torques above 10 x 10 (exp - 9) N-m have been obtained. The behavior is monitored with integrated shaft encoders which are photodiodes which measure the rotor response. Magnetic levitation of the rotor via reluctance forces has been achieved and has reduced frictional torque losses to less than 1 percent of the available torque. The results indicate that high speed limits of these actuators are related to torque ripple. Hysteresis motors with magnetic bearings are under consideration and will produce high speed rotational machines with excellent sensor application potential...|$|R
