50|$|Being a third {{generation}} social systems theorist {{influenced by the}} works of Niklas Luhmann, Roth's major research is on theories and applications of functional differentiation in (post-) <b>modern</b> <b>societies.</b> Roth {{was among the first}} to apply culturomics in sociology, with one major result of this research being that the (self-) definition of <b>modern</b> <b>societies</b> as capitalist or economized may be inappropriate.|$|R
5|$|As Norway gained full {{independence}} in 1905, {{the national government}} determined to establish institutions consistent with the newly formed state's ambitions as a <b>modern</b> <b>society.</b> The first prime minister made it a priority to modernize the Royal Palace in Oslo, building among other things, some of the country's first water toilets, providing hot and cold water, and granting the Royal Family's wish of providing a common apartment for the king, queen, and their son.|$|E

5|$|Karas won the Best Original Video at the 2006 Tokyo Anime Award competition, {{and most}} reviewers were {{impressed}} with the images produced by fusing 2D and 3D art techniques.

5|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age. The symptoms appear before a person is twelve years old, are present {{for more than six}} months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance. Although it causes impairment, particularly in <b>modern</b> <b>society,</b> many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{hailed the}} Thirukkural as a {{valuable}} scripture which contained many scientific and philosophical truths. He also praised the secular nature of the work. Periyar praised Thiruvalluvar for his description of God as a formless entity with only positive attributes. He also suggested that one who reads the Thirukkural will become a Self-respecter, absorbing knowledge in politics, society, and economics. According to him, though certain items in this ancient book of ethics may not relate to today, it permitted such changes for <b>modern</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Italian theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's {{concept of}} {{evil in the}} eighteenth century. He noted a {{distinction}} between using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of <b>modern</b> <b>society</b> as to why suffering exists.|$|E

5|$|Tsubasa {{explores the}} {{fragility}} of human relationships through Sakura losing all of her memories involving her love interest, Syaoran. Despite this tragedy, Syaoran manages to become friends with other characters across his journey. Furthermore, Sakura once again develops feelings for Syaoran who {{at the same time}} starts falling for her again. The development of the characters' relationship demonstrates how while <b>modern</b> <b>society</b> depends on already existing one, a severed one can be reformed if people have the will. At the same time, Syaoran has to say goodbye to the people he met as a result of having to continue travelling. Despite also losing these new founds friends, these actions will help Syaoran grow into a young man.|$|E
5|$|While {{equality}} jurisprudence primarily centres {{around a}} pledge of {{the protection of}} equal laws, laws frequently classify individuals out of necessity. Needless to say, {{the very idea of}} classification is premised on, and engenders, inequality. Therein lies the paradox of equality jurisprudence. The necessity of differentiation is even more paramount in <b>modern</b> <b>society</b> with its increasingly complicated problems. Joseph Tussman and Jacobus tenBroek have proposed the doctrine of reasonable classification as the solution, whereby the legislation defines the class that includes all who are similarly situated for the purpose of the law and none who are not.|$|E
5|$|After the Deluge, {{also known}} as The Forty-First Day, is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by English artist George Frederic Watts, first exhibited as The Sun in an incomplete form in 1886 and completed in 1891. It shows {{a scene from the}} story of Noah's Flood, in which after 40 days of rain Noah opens the window of his Ark to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that <b>modern</b> <b>society</b> was in decline owing to a lack of moral values, and he often painted works on the topic of the Flood and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting {{takes the form of a}} stylised seascape, dominated by a bright sunburst breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in The Genius of Greek Poetry in 1878, After the Deluge took a radically different approach. With this painting he intended to evoke a monotheistic God in the act of creation, but avoid depicting the Creator directly.|$|E
