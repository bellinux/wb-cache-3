40|$|Short Message Service (SMS) and <b>multimedia</b> <b>message</b> <b>service</b> (<b>MMS)</b> {{has grown}} in {{popularity}} {{over the years and}} it has become a common way of communication. SMS is usually used to transport unclassified information, but with the rise of mobile commerce it has become a popular tool for transmitting sensitive information between the business and its clients. By default SMS does not guarantee confidentiality and integrity to the message content. There is no end-to-end security (including authentication, and non-repudiation) in these services. Therefore SMS is not totally secure and reliable. This hinders service providers to provide some services that require communication of high-level security.

40|$|The {{fast growing}} market for smart phones coupled with their almost {{constant}} on-line presence makes these devices the new targets of malicious code (virus) writers. To aggravate the issue, the security level {{of these devices}} is far below the state-of-the art of what is used in personal computers. It has been recently found that the topological spread of <b>multimedia</b> <b>message</b> <b>service</b> (<b>MMS)</b> viruses is highly restricted by the underlying fragmentation of the call graph—the term topological here refers to the explicit use of the call graph topology to find vulnerable phones. In this paper, we study MMS viruses under another type of spreading behavior that locates vulnerable phones by generating a random list of numbers to be contacted, generally referred to as scanning. We find that hybrid MMS viruses including some level of scanning are more dangerous to the mobile community than their standard topological counterparts. Interestingly, this paper shows that the topological and scanning behaviors of MMS viruses can be more damaging in high and low market share cases, respectively. The results also show that given sufficient time, sophisticated viruses may infect a large fraction of susceptible phones without being detected. Fortunately, with the improvement of phone providers’ monitoring ability and the timely installations of patches on infected phones, one can contain the spread of MMS viruses. Our findings lead {{to a better understanding}} on how one could prevent the spread of mobile-phone viruses even in light of new behaviors such as scanning.

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScIn South Africa, Deaf people {{communicate}} with one another and the broader community by means of South African Sign Language. The majority of Deaf people who have access to a mobile phone (cell phone) use Short Message Service (SMS) to communicate and share information with hearing people, but seldom use it among themselves. It is assumed that video messaging will be more accessible to Deaf people, since their level of literacy may prevent them from making effective use of information that is disseminated via texting/SMS. The principal objective of the esearch was to explore a cost-effective and efficient mass multimedia messaging system. The intention was to adapt a successful text-based mass notification system, developed by a local nongovernmental organization (NGO), to accommodate efficient and affordable video mass messaging for Deaf people. The questions that underpin this research are: How should video- streaming mass-messaging methods be compared and evaluated to find the most suitable method to deliver an affordable and acceptable service to Deaf people? What transport vehicles should be considered: <b>Multimedia</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Service</b> (<b>MMS),</b> the web, electronic mail, or a cell phone resident push/pullapplication? Which is the most cost effective? And, finally: How does the video quality of the various transport vehicles differ in terms of the clarity of the sign language as perceived by the Deaf? The soft-systems methodology and a mixed-methods methodology were used to address the research questions. The soft-systems methodology was followed to manage the research process and the mixed-methods research methodology was followed to collect data. Data was collected by means of experiments and semi-structured interviews. A prototype for mobile phone usage was developed and evaluated with Deaf members the NGO Deaf Community of Cape Town. The technology and internet usage of the Deaf participants provided background information. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) was used to analyse the quantitative data, and content analysis was used to analyse the documents and interviews. All of the Deaf participants used their mobile phones for SMS and the majority (81. 25 %) used English to type messages; however, all indicated that they would have preferred to use South Africa sign language on their mobile phones if it were available. And they were quite willing to pay between 75 c and 80 c per message for using such a video-messaging service. Of the transport vehicles demonstrated, most Deaf people indic indicated that they preferred to use the SMS prototype (with a web link to the video) rather than the MMS prototype with the video attached. They were, however, very concerned about the cost of using the system, as well as the quality of the sign language videos. South Afric...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the {{explosive}} growth and adoption of mobile phones has become commonplace in our everyday lives (Haghirian, Madlberger & Tanuskova 2005). In 1997, there were only 215 million people worldwide who used mobile phones as communication devices (Bauer, Barnes, Reichardt & Neumann 2005). Today, {{it is estimated that}} 2 billion people own a mobile phone worldwide and this number makes up a third of the entire human population (Wireless Intelligence 2005). Mobile phones are no longer thought of as mere personal communication tools (Cheong & Park 2005; Ito & Okabe 2005). They have become a fashion symbol for teenagers and young adults (Katz and Sugiyama 2005). Personalised ring tones, colours, display logos and accessories are individualised accordingly to suit individuals’ preferences (Bauer, Barnes, Reichardt & Neumann 2005). Furthermore, mobile phones are no longer just a platform for voice calls and sending and receiving text messages such as Short Messaging Service (SMS). Photos, pictures and video clips can be attached as a <b>Multimedia</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Service</b> (<b>MMS)</b> for communication purposes too (Okazaki 2005 a). With the recent introduction of 3 G mobile technology, mobile phone users are able to perform more activities via their 3 G enabled phone sets. They are able to browse the Internet fairly quickly, access online banking, play video games wirelessly, watch television programs, check for weather forecasts, allow instant messaging, and perform live video-conferencing (Okazaki 2005 b). The rapid growth of the mobile industry has created a foundation for mobile commerce (m-commerce). M-commerce facilitates electronic commerce via the use of mobile devices to communicate and conduct transactions through public and private networks (Balasubramanian, Peterson & Jarvenpaa 2002). The current emerging set of applications and services that m-commerce offers include mobile financial applications, mobile entertainment and services, product locating and shopping, wireless engineering, mobile auctions, wireless data centres and mobile advertising (Malloy, Varshney & Snow 2002). Commercial research has indicated that consumers’ interest in m-commerce services and mobile payments have increased from 23 % in 2001 to 39 % in 2003 (Harris, Rettie & Cheung 2005). It is projected that by 2009 the global mobile commerce market will be worth at least US$ 40 billion (Juniper Research 2004). 2 Considering the projected worth of mobile commerce and the number of mobile subscribers, mobile marketing is increasingly attractive as companies can now directly convey their marketing efforts to reach their consumers without time or location barriers (Barnes 2002). The potential of using the mobile medium to market is now more attractive than before (Karjaluoto 2005), as it can assist companies in building stronger relationships with consumers (Barwise and Strong 2002), and {{can be used as a}} promotional channel to reach consumers directly (Barnes 2002; Kavassalis,, Spyropoulou, Drossos, Mitrokostas, Gikas, & Hatzistamatiou 2003; Okazaki 2004) anywhere and anytime. However many aspects of mobile marketing are still in its infancy (Bauer, Barnes, Reichardt & Neumann 2005; Haghirian, Madlberger & Tanuskova 2005; Okazaki 2004, 2005 b; Tsang, Ho & Liang 2004). Research into mobile marketing is currently lacking as this is a relatively new phenomenon. Very few studies have been conducted to demonstrate how the mobile phone channel can be successfully integrated into marketing activities of companies (Balasubramanian, Peterson & Jarvenpaa 2002; Haghirian, Madlberger & Tanuskova 2005). Furthermore, no studies to date have compared the effectiveness of this mobile medium in delivering advertising and sales promotion with other more established media such as the print medium (Lee and Brown 2005). The fundamental question that remains unresolved is, “What is the difference between mobile marketing and traditional marketing?” Will this new form of marketing be effective? How will consumers respond to this form of marketing? What will be the benefit to marketers when consumers receive this type of advertising? These are just some of the issues that marketers are concerned with in order to evaluate the mobile channels for marketing purposes and are questions that are core to Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) and technology intervention research...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} {{of the use of}} mobile phones has created new delivery platforms to both marketers and advertisers. As the popularity of mobile devices increases, Short Messaging Service (SMS) has become more important to access potential customers. Recently, Internet and mobile telephony technologies have become more integrated. The marriage of the Internet and wireless telephony that use such platforms as Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) Short Message Services (SMS), and variants of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) can make serious financial contributions to global wireless advertising revenue as a new advertising arena. This new advertising platform, which is wireless advertising or mobile advertising, refers to any communication about products, services, and ideas uses mobile devices for promotional purposes. There are two forms of mobile advertising. The early and the first form is the SMS ads and the second mobile advertising form is <b>Multimedia</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Service</b> (<b>MMS).</b> MMS ads are more creative and effective than was the early mobile advertising form. SMS advertising offers important advantages to the advertiser who seeks to have effective two- way communication with consumers. The research on attitudes toward advertising has two important branches. One is the attitude toward the ad (Aad), and the other is the attitude toward advertising in general. Aad concept is related to a specific advertisement, especially exposure to the advertising in specific mediums. In contrast to Aad, the attitude toward advertising in general is related to the consumers’ general idea of the advertising system and is a more comprehensive concept. Early studies on Aad focus on the consumers’ cognitive information process in terms of recall of ad content, unaided recall, and recognition. Then, studies started to investigate the nature and effects of consumers’ affective reaction to actual advertising stimuli. Consumer attitudes toward advertising in general are widely researched. Most of these studies focus on the structure of advertising attitudes rather than the generalizability of overall attitudes. In other words, respondents typically are asked not only about their overall attitudes toward advertisement, but also their perception of advertising in terms of trustworthiness, offensiveness, informativeness, entertainment value, the effects on product prices and value as well as the attitudes toward regulatory issues. In recent years, consumers’ attitudes towards new medium advertisement, such as the Internet, are being investigated. Most studies attempting to measure attitudes toward online advertising derive their theoretical frameworks from previous studies of attitude toward advertising in general. The starting point of consumer attitudes toward SMS advertising studies is based on the models of consumer attitudes toward online advertising studies and the constructs of those models. Additionally, the Diffusion of Innovation Theory, Technology Acceptance Theory, and the Theory of Reasoned Action have been used to explain consumer attitudes towards SMS advertising. These theories can explain and develop models for both intention and behavior toward acceptance of SMS advertising. According to other studies on consumer attitudes toward SMS advertising, permission, wireless service provider control, mobile advertising trust, perceived irritation, information, entertainment, credibility, and delivery of message are the mentioned factors that explain consumer attitudes toward SMS advertising. However, irritation, information, entertainment, credibility, and permission are the highlighted factors in these studies. This study examines the factors that affect consumer attitudes towards SMS advertising and the relationship between these factors and attitude. Face-to-face survey was the method chosen to collect the data. The questionnaire has two parts. The first part contains 30 items that measures attitudes toward SMS advertising. In {{the second part of the}} questionnaire, age, sex and mobile phone ownership of respondents were determined. Respondents were chosen by using the Convenience Sampling method. The 30 items on the attitude measurement scale were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation. 13 items was excluded analysis and 17 items produced four components with eigenvalues that exceeded 1. These components were named as Infotainment, Life Partner, Privacy, and Irritation. The results show parallel findings to the literature, namely, that Irritation is the most important factor that affects attitudes toward SMS advertising. The research presents a new attitude indicator called “Life Partner” that can be further analyzed in future studies. To investigate the relationship between factors that affect the attitudes toward SMS advertising and attitudes as a construct confirmatory second-order factor analysis was used. attitude is conceptualized as a second order construct that has four dimensions: Infotainment, Life Partner, Privacy, and Irritation. The validity of this developed theory was tested using confirmatory factor analysis. According to the results of confirmatory second-order factor analysis, attitude relates negatively to Infotainment (-. 59) and Life Partner (-. 17), but related positively to Privacy (. 64) and Irritation (. 83). Attitude shows strong relationships with Irritation, Privacy, and Infotainment respectively. Life Partner shows the weakest relationship. The findings of this study show parallel results to those in the literature, meaning that, the attitudes of Turkish consumers toward SMS advertising can be analyzed using similar factors already presented in the literature. Credibility and Permission did not find support in our findings as indicators of attitude toward SMS advertising, but the Life Partner factor did as a new indicator. In future studies, these indicators should be given extra importance and analyzed for their exact position with repeated studies. In this study we focused on the factors affecting attitudes structure rather than intention and behavior dimensions of models. So, in future studies, the finding of this study must be tested with broader models that can include the intention and behavior dimension that originated with the TRA, TAM and Innovation Diffusion theories...|$|E
