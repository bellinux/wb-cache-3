5|$|The normal {{function}} of the adrenal gland may be impaired by conditions such as infections, tumors, genetic disorders and autoimmune diseases, or as {{a side effect of}} <b>medical</b> <b>therapy.</b> These disorders affect the gland either directly (as with infections or autoimmune diseases) or {{as a result of the}} dysregulation of hormone production (as in some types of Cushing's syndrome) leading to an excess or insufficiency of adrenal hormones and the related symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{surgical}} procedures {{exist in the}} treatment of IIH: optic nerve sheath decompression and fenestration and shunting. Surgery would normally only be offered if <b>medical</b> <b>therapy</b> is either unsuccessful or not tolerated. The choice between these two procedures depends on the predominant problem in IIH. Neither procedure is perfect: both may cause significant complications, and both may eventually fail in controlling the symptoms. There are no randomized controlled trials to guide the decision as to which procedure is best.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is not a}} benign, holistic {{or natural}} treatment for epilepsy; as with any serious <b>medical</b> <b>therapy,</b> there may be complications. These are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery. Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include constipation, low-grade acidosis and hypoglycaemia {{if there is an}} initial fast. Raised levels of lipids in the blood affect up to 60% of children and cholesterol levels may increase by around 30%. This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats, and, if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio. Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many micronutrients.|$|E

5|$|Homozygous FH {{is harder}} to treat. The LDL receptors are {{minimally}} functional, if at all. Only high doses of statins, often {{in combination with other}} medications, are modestly effective in improving lipid levels. If <b>medical</b> <b>therapy</b> is not successful at reducing cholesterol levels, LDL apheresis may be used; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of dialysis. Very severe cases may be considered for a liver transplant; this provides a liver with normally functional LDL receptors, and leads to rapid improvement of the cholesterol levels, but at the risk of complications from any solid organ transplant (such as rejection, infections, or side-effects of the medication required to suppress rejection). Other surgical techniques include partial ileal bypass surgery, in which part of the small bowel is bypassed to decrease the absorption of nutrients and hence cholesterol, and portacaval shunt surgery, in which the portal vein is connected to the vena cava to allow blood with nutrients from the intestine to bypass the liver.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Endometriosis {{remains a}} cause of {{significant}} morbidity in reproductive-aged women resulting in pelvic pain, pelvic masses and infertility. Endometriosis {{is defined as the}} presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside of their normal intrauterine location, most commonly in the dependent portions of the pelvis. Endometriosis can be treated with <b>medical</b> <b>therapies</b> or surgery, both conservative and radical. The <b>medical</b> <b>therapies</b> include oral contraceptive pills, progestins, gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues and danazol. All of these <b>medical</b> <b>therapies</b> induce a hormonal steady state that results in an environment not conducive to the growth of endometriosis. Surgical therapies for endometriosis-associated pain include conservative treatments which include removal of endometriotic implants and adhesions with restoration of normal anatomy. Radical surgery involves removal of the uterus with or without removal of the ovaries in patients who have completed childbearing. Basic science discoveries about endometriosis hold the promise for less invasive diagnostic tests and improved therapies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONMulticentric Reticulo{{histiocytosis}} (MRH) {{is a rare}} non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterised by destructive polyarthritis and violaceous skin papules. PRESENTATION OF CASEIn 2010, a 70 -year-old {{woman with}} Palindromic Rheumatism was diagnosed with MRH. Within a few months, she developed ankylosis of the small joints of both hands which resulted in severe fixed flexion deformities of the fingers and thumbs. The joint disease {{failed to respond to}} <b>medical</b> <b>therapies</b> and the palmar skin of her left hand was becoming increasingly macerated. Therefore, she elected to undergo arthrodesis of the metacarpophalangeal joints to allow hand hygiene. DISCUSSIONTo-date, this is the first report of a surgical intervention for this rare condition and represents a novel avenue of potential <b>therapy.</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>therapies</b> for MRH are usually ineffective in preventing the debilitating small joint disease which often develops and there is on-going research into newer agents and alternative surgical techniques. CONCLUSIONOnce <b>medical</b> <b>therapies</b> are exhausted, clinicians should consider the input of Hand Surgeons in managing the inevitable and mutilating joint disease of this rare condition...|$|R
