40|$|Although {{attention}} to labor <b>market</b> <b>preparation,</b> access, and retention for disadvan-taged workers {{has experienced a}} dramatic turnaround in the past 6 years for economic and policy reasons, serious challenges remain. Today’s workforce development implies more than employment training in the narrow sense: It means substantial employer engagement, deep community connections, career advancement, integrative human service supports, contextual and industry-driven education and training, reformed community colleges, and connective tissue of networks. This article dis-cusses six areas of workforce development learning: (a) retention and advancement, (b) employer and jobseeker customers, (c) regions and neighborhoods, (d) race and labor markets, (e) best practices and replication, and (f) labor market reform. In addi-tion to inevitable economic downturns, optimism should be tempered by three big challenges: the underlying patterns of wage and income inequality, the persistence of race and gender inequalities, and our historic failure to create effective links between schools and labor markets.

40|$|Background: Amoxicillin trihydrate is used a broad {{spectrum}} antibiotic {{for the treatment of}} diverse variety of bacterial infections. Aim: The objectives {{of the present study was}} an assessment of in vitro drug release profile and estimation of the drug content of the prepared in-house time-dependent release bilayer tablet formulations of amoxicillin trihydrate (AMT) employing a simple, rapid, sensitive and a cost effective reverse phase liquid chromatography method. Materials and Methods: The chromatographic separation was achieved using methanol and phosphate buffer (pH 3. 5) at 50 : 50 % v/v as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Results: The method was validated for linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection, limit of quantitation and system suitability. The linearity was determined by residual analysis indicated good regression coefficient (r 2) of 0. 999 at a concentration ranging between 2 and 16 μg/mL. The assay of both in-house formulation and <b>marketed</b> <b>preparation</b> indicated good recovery of 99. 95 % and 99. 60 %, respectively.

However, tracked educational systems are also known to increase inequality of educational opportunity. This presumed trade-off between equality and labor <b>market</b> <b>preparation</b> is clearly rooted in two different perspectives on the origin of differentiation in educational systems, dating back to the nineteenth century. Tracking was seen both as a way to prepare students for an industrializing labor market and as a way for the elite to formalize social distances in the educational system. We empirically study the trade-off with newly developed country-level indicators for tracking and vocational orientation. Our country-level regressions largely support the existence of the trade-off between labor market allocation and equality of opportunity...|$|E

Moreover, these differences were stronger in strongly stratified educational systems relative to comprehensive systems, indicating that vocationally oriented schooling systems prepare less well for active citizenship than for the labor market. ...|$|E

40|$|While {{technology}} {{adoption is}} a major stream of research in information systems, {{few studies have examined}} the antecedents and consequences of mandatory adoption of technologies. To address this gap, we develop and test a model of mandatory citizen adoption of an e-government technology. Based on a framework that outlines the key stages associated with the launch of technology products, we identify various external factors as antecedents of four key technology adoption variables from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), i. e., performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions, which ultimately impact citizen satisfaction. The four stages of technology launch and the salient antecedents in each stage are: (1) <b>market</b> <b>preparation</b> stage?awareness; (2) targeting stage?compatibility and self-efficacy; (3) positioning stage?flexibility and avoidance of personal interaction; and (4) execution stage?trust, convenience, and assistance. We test our model in a two-stage survey of 1, 179 Hong Kong citizens, before and after they were issued a mandatory smart card to access e-government services. We find that the various factors tied to the different stages in launching the technology predict key technology adoption variables that, in turn, predict citizen satisfaction with e-government technology. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications for governments implementing technologies whose use by citizens is mandated...|$|E

40|$|Prompted by {{the need}} to expand the criminological enterprise, I put forward a {{criminology}} of education that offers a deeper understanding of education’s purpose in contemporary society. In tracing the reconfiguration of social security and understandings of citizenship in Western capitalist societies, education is situated as a centrally important institution of social governance. Moving from ‘the social’ as the predominant category of governance to smaller, individualized units of governance such as the ‘community’ has produced a post-social state which involves significant implications for political institutions, including crime control and education. This is illustrated by the ‘criminalization of schools’ thesis, which posits that schools increasingly take on responsibilities for governing crime {{to the point that they}} are now governed through crime. <b>Market</b> <b>preparation</b> constitutes another governing principle of education, encapsulated in what can be termed the ‘marketization of schools’, which points to education’s role in producing lean, active citizens. I draw on the work of Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu for explicating the features of governance and discipline, and their articulation. I then turn to explore the empirical referent found in recent efforts to rethink and reorganize student discipline policies in Ontario schools. The ‘discovery’ of bullying in Ontario is suggested to be a discursive reality that made possible the implementation of a program of regulation. From this, we see that education is conceptualized and represented as a ‘security apparatus’, and education policies as increasingly concerned with managing public safety and social order...|$|E
