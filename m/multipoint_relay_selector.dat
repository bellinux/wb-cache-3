With network coding, intermediate nodes forward packets that are linear combinations of previously received packets. The type of networks we consider are vehicle mounted mobile tactical radio networks. Tactical communication may be required in areas where pre-deployed base stations are unavailable.

This paper introduces a new packet flooding mechanism for information dissemination in mobile ad hoc networks. Neighbor Aware Adapative Power (NAAP) flooding, attempts to reduce redundant broadcasts and power consumption during flooding with the aim of minimizing medium contention among neighboring nodes thereby allowing for increased channel utilization.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{revealed}} in the literature that pure <b>multipoint</b> <b>relaying</b> (MPR) algorithms demonstrate both simplicity and outstanding performance, as compared to other flooding algorithms in wireless networks. One drawback of pure MPR algorithms is that the selected forwarding set may not represent the optimum selection. In addition, little efforts have been carried-out to investigate the performance of such algorithms in noisy mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) suffering from high packet-loss and node mobility. In this paper, we develop and evaluate the performance of an optimal MPR (OMPR) algorithm for route discovery in noisy MANETs. The main feature of this new algorithm is that it calculates all possible sets of <b>multipoint</b> <b>relays</b> (MPRs) and then selects the set with minimum number of nodes.

Energy preservation {{has received}} increased attention in the recent years. The new transmission scheme for energy-constrained WSNs was using stateless multicast protocol. The scheme, called MIHOP (Made It Happen On Purpose), combines cluster-based virtual MIMO and multihop technologies. The multihop mode is employed in data transmission. Here the related sensors are located within a specific number of hops from the sink, and the virtual MIMO mode is used for transmitting data from the remaining sensor nodes. The comparison of the energy consumption of different transmission schemes was performed and propose an algorithm for determining the optimal hop count in MIHOP. The controllable mobile sink reduces the energy consumed in sensor transmission is also adopted for data collection. This project combine both MIMO with multi point relay set. MIMO technology takes {{the advantage of a}} radio wave phenomenon called multipath where transmitting the information to other objects.

MCOM utilizes the forwarding structure <b>Multipoint</b> <b>relay</b> (MPR) of the proactive unicast routing protocols as duplication points. In MCOM, addresses of MPRs are included in data packets instead of addresses of receivers as in the traditional connectionless multicast protocol Xcast. After receiving multicast packets from source, specific MPRs use SMF to deliver the packets to receivers. Two simulators NS- 2 and nsclick were used to evaluate performance of protocols.
